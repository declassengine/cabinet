CONFIDENTIAL.TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH GERMANY.REPORT BY SIR FREDERICK LEITH-ROSS.Part I. General Political and Economic Situation in Germany.1. IT may be useful to preface this report by some general impressions of the situation in Germany. The people of Germany are still hypnotised by Hitler&apos;s personality. There is some indication of a change of sentiment towards the regime and some falling off of enthusiasm even towards Hitler. There are growing doubts in all classes of society as to where their leader is taking them. But it would be unwise to build too much on such indications. Just as in America Roosevelt has captured the popular imagination, however much the details of his policy may be criticised, so the vast masses in Germany have pinned their faith to Hitler and regard him as the only hope in their difficulties. Moreover, the present Government represents a form of bolshevism in the sense that policy is directed by fanatically energetic but inexperienced and often ill-educated elements. The upper classes have been cowed by the atrocities which marked the revolution and the lower classes have been doped into submission by the intensive Nazi propaganda to which they are subjected. The streets are continually paraded by troops and labour battalions, whose object is to train the youth of Germany in the spirit of discipline and solidarity. Huge demon-strations are staged, and staged very effectively, to excite and to maintain the mass psychology of national socialism. The party organisation still holds the key positions, and with its network of spies and background of force effectively prevents any doubts which may be felt from being expressed openly.2. It would be a mistake, therefore, to expect any sudden change of regime. Even if Hitler should be removed, either by assassination or by a breakdown, the best qualified observers think that he Avould be succeeded by Goering or some other nominee backed by the Reichswehr. The latter have strengthened their position, and are like an armed guard on a ship steered by an inexperienced and rather intoxicated helmsman. The steering is capricious, and the course is far from settled, while the weather is thickening, but order will be maintained and the helmsman may be expected gradually to work off the fumes of his debauch and to acquire experience. The best prospect is that there should be a gradual evolution on the part of the present Government to more moderate policies.3. There seems no particular reason to think that this process can be hastened by economic difficulties. The coming winter is certainly going to be difficult for Germany. The foreign exchange resources of the Reichsbank are decidedly strained; and there is already a shortage of foreign goods. But. as was proved during the war, Germany can last out a long time on her own resources. The harvest has been adequate and there is no immediate apprehension as to the food supplies of the people; considerable stocks of raw materials have been laid in; and many producers are still to be found who at a pinch are prepared to supply raw materials on some credit. Thus, no immediate economic collapse seems probable, and Germany, whatever her difficulties may be, cannot in present circumstances be blockaded into submission. All that could be done would be merely to restrict our own trade and to add to our own economic difficulties, as well as to Germany&apos;s, while giving the Nazi party an excellent pretext for the anti-foreign propaganda on which it relies to justify the tightening of the belt which it is demanding of the nation. We should therefore, I think, do all we can to maintain our trade with Germany so long as we can do so without increasing our credit commitments to her.
4. The essential cause of the economic difficulties of Germany is the incon-sistency between the financial and the economic policies which the Government has been forced to follow. As Dr. Schacht said, the Nazi revolution was largely a protest against the policy of deflation in the preceding years, which had raised the number of unemployed to over 6 millions. Deflation could not be continued and it was necessary to initiate a moderate inflation of credit in order to stimulate the internal market. This, logically, should have involved a depreciation of the mark, but the experience of Germany in the post-war years was such that the thought of a fresh depreciation fills everyone with alarm. Between these rigid limits of policy which prohibit alike deflation and depreciation, the German economy is in a strait-waistcoat. In other countries a temporary expedient for relieving the pressure could be found by increasing foreign credits, but Germany has already over-borrowed, and Dr. Schacht&apos;s treatment of his present creditors has been such as to bar the door effectively to any large new credits. Thus the German Government is forced to adopt every shift and expedient in the way of restricting imports and postponing debts in the hope of providing for the essential economic needs of the country. This policy of restriction must, however, lead eventually to an impasse. In the end Germany will almost certainly be forced to devalue, and if an appropriate moment can be found for linking the mark with the pound instead of with gold, the present acute economic difficulties would probably disappear within a comparatively short period.5. Until, however, the German Government make up their minds to this policy we must face the fact that they will certainly take all possible steps to restrict unnecessary imports, and to postpone and evade payment on their trading and financial debts, with the exception of the short-term debts covered by the stillstand, which are essential for the maintenance of their commerce. Foreign traders who deal in commodities not essential to Germany must either allow their trade to be restricted or allow payment for their goods to be more and more frozen. But no trading country wishes to accept these alternatives, and every country which has an adverse balance of trade with Germany responds by taking measures to defend its interests. The most obvious method is by means of a Clearing, under which the foreign exchange resulting from German exports to a country is ear-marked either in whole or in the first place to meet the claims of traders and creditors in that country. Germany has now accepted Clearing arrangements with some seventeen countries, and each of these Clearings tends to make it more difficult for Germany to buy in other countries, and thus diverts trade from its normal channels. For example, the German textile industry needs British yarns, but is forced to buy from Switzerland and Czechoslovakia at 20 per cent, higher prices, because it can obtain goods from these countries through the Cleaving, whereas it is not able to get sterling to pay for British goods. From the wider economic standpoint, the policy of Clearings is destructive of international trade, but in present conditions it enables the countries which import goods from Germany to some extent to safeguard their interests.II.-Resume of Discussions in Berlin  (September 18-27).6. The immediate object of the recent negotiations in Berlin was to discuss the effect on trade with the United Kingdom of the new German exchange control regulations, which were brought into force on the 24th September. These regulations abolished the system of allocating exchange to the individual German importer on the basis of his 1931 imports, and replaced it by a system under which the exchange available will be allocated preferentially to the essential German needs for food-stuffs and raw materials. The new scheme, therefore, not only threatened to restrict imports of United Kingdom goods into Germany, but also destroyed the foundation of the Exchange Agreement with Germany, concluded so recently as the 10th August, by abolishing the system of exchange control on which that Agreement was based.Application of new German Exchange Regulations to United Kingdom Trade.7. Accordingly, the first point was to ascertain the probable effect of the new system, and next to secure guarantees for United Kingdom trade. The German Delegation explained that, owing to the disastrous foreign exchange position, the new regulations would provide that on and after the 24th September,
1934, German importers would not be allowed any foreign exchange to pay for goods imported from abroad, unless permits for such imports had previously been granted by the German authorities. In granting such permits the policy would be to restrict non-essential imports, priority being given to imports of foodstuffs, raw materials, and semi-manufactured goods necessary for German industry. If German needs alone were to be regarded, no exchange would be provided for other imports, but the German Government recognised that this was not a practicable policy, and account would have to be taken of commercial relations with foreign countries. It was therefore proposed to negotiate with foreign countries on the basis that Germany would grant exchange for imports of articles not necessary to her, in return for inci&quot;eased facilities for German exports.The reply was obvious. The German tariff had already limited dispensable imports from the United Kingdom, but German exports to the United Kingdom were largely of that character; moreover, the balance of trade was heavily against the United Kingdom. The question was not what additional export facilities Germany would receive in return for safeguarding the existing United Kingdom trade, but how much Germany would lose in the event of inevitable retaliation by the United Kingdom against such a policy. How. therefore, did Germany propose to safeguard United Kingdom interests as from the 24th September ?Provisional A greement.8. The German Delegation thereupon proposed that there should be detailed negotiations, but that, pending the conclusion of a permanent agreement, a provisional arrangement should be made to safeguard United Kingdom exports to Germany. The terms of this arrangement are set out in the Annex to this Report, together with a comment by the Board of Trade which was also published in the United Kingdom Press on the 25th September. Under this declaration the German Government undertake temporarily to maintain in force the Exchange Agreement and to allow goods covered by it to be imported into Germany to an extent corresponding to the present volume of British imports, no distinction being drawn between individual groups of goods. The arrangement will apply until the end of October or until the coming into force of a new arrangement, whichever is the earlier. It amounts to maintaining the status quo while we complete our negotiations.The Exchange Agreement.9. So far the German proposals were satisfactory as an interim measure. But the Exchange Agreement (which provided a mechanism for obtaining exchange for United Kingdom exports without direct allocations of foreign exchange by the Reichsbank) had not worked well. In fact, payments into the account at the Reichsbank were suspended on the 12th September because too many marks had been paid into it; and a far larger sum even was awaiting-transfer to the account. Meanwhile, despite the fact that the United Kingdom was importing from Germany more than twice as much as Germany was importing from the United Kingdom, sales of the marks from the account and corresponding payments of sterling to United Kingdom exporters were disappointingly slow. Clearly something had to be done to stimulate the market in the United Kingdom for marks paid into the Account (&quot; Sondermarks &quot;). As a result of discussions with the German Delegation, facilities were accorded by the Reichsbank for the use of sondermarks lying in the account for various mercantile purposes not originally provided for in the Agreement, and the Reichsbank undertook to put pressure upon any German exporters who refused to accept sondermarks from their United Kingdom debtors in payment of debts due in other currencies. As a result of these arrangements, and possibly owing to a decline in German orders placed in the United Kingdom in anticipation of the new exchange regulations, the position had improved by the end of the Delegation^ stay in Berlin and payments into the account had been resumed. But the amount awaiting payment into the account is still tending to grow, and it seems improbable that British importers can be induced to use the sondermark machinery to the necessary extent unless it is made a legal obligation on them to do so.   This involves putting into force the Debts Clearing Offices, &amp;c, Act.
Trade Debts.10. This vexed question was brought repeatedly to the notice of the German delegation. The returns collected by the Board of Trade show that in respect of the period the 1st March-30th June, 1934, over  1,800,000 is due to the United Kingdom from Germany in respect of ordinary commercial credits. The German delegation recognised the urgency of clearing off such debts as soon as possible, but they urged that there was no possibility of making any definite arrangement for their liquidation except in the framework of a Clearing agreement. The suggestion that as a gesture of goodwill the German Government should allocate immediately the comparatively small amount of sterling ( 182,000) required for the payment of the creditors whose claims did not exceed  1,000 was put to the German Delegation. The proposal was one which seemed very reasonable, since not only was the amount of exchange involved comparatively small, but its adoption would have eliminated over 60 per cent, of the creditors in the United Kingdom, the lai&apos;ger creditors being left to be dealt with under some more detailed scheme. The proposal was, however, rejected both by the German delegation and by Dr. Schacht, to whom I mentioned it personally, as not possible. It was claimed that the available foreign exchange was so limited that even the payment of this sum could not be assured within any definite period, say, one month. The matter had to be left there, but I took occasion to point out that, if Germany could not provide this foreign exchange now, the Clearing proposals (which are discussed below) would not place her in a better position to do so. To this, however, the answer was given that, while admittedly a Clearing-would not increase foreign exchange resources, it would enable Germany to claim, when faced with demands for repayment from third countries, that in paying off United Kingdom debts she is merely returning a portion of the foreign exchange furnished to her by the agreement with the United Kingdom. There is no doubt that Germany is being pressed by a number of other countries to provide payment of frozen commercial debts, and in the case of some countries the amounts involved are much larger than those due to British traders.Coal and Herrings.A11. I laid special emphasis on the necessity for foreign exchange being allotted for imports into Germany of United Kingdom coal and herrings. As regards coal, the Germans admitted their moral obligation, in view of the Agreement of May 1933, to provide facilities for imports into the Reich up to the agreed quota, and they agreed that such imports should be admitted and paid for under the Exchange Agreement. At first they refused to allow similar facilities for bunker coal and coal imported into the free ports, but when I pressed the matter they yielded this point, too, for the period of the provisional arrangement (see paragraph 8).As regards herrings, the strong representations of the English and Scottish herring industry were communicated to the German delegation, who replied that the arrangement referred to in paragraph 8 above would cover for the interim period imports of United Kingdom herrings. The Germans reiterated that any assurance as to the continuance of these facilities for coal, herrings and other United Kingdom exports not essential to Germany could only be given as part of a new arrangement, and I made it clear that an undertaking to safeguard these trades would be essential to us in any such arrangement.clear in g Discussions.12. From the first it was apparent that the German Delegation, while disclaiming on general economic grounds any liking for the clearing system, had already made up their minds to an agreed clearing with the United Kingdom. It may be that the German Government realise that the imposition of clearings by France, Switzerland and Holland must force them, unless a clearing is agreed with the United Kingdom, to discriminate against United Kingdom trade, a course which could only result in a one-sided clearing imposed on Germany by the United Kingdom without negotiation and without the guarantees which the German Government hope to obtain by negotiation.    The settlement of frozen
debts was also stated to be practicable only through a clearing. The original German view was that the clearing should exclude re-exports, but should cover (1) Mutual trade in domestic produce and manufactures; (2) Interest on the Dawes and Young Loans; (3) Frozen debts;(4) The discount on Standstill obligations, and the turnover of Standstill Bills covering trade between the two countries;and finally, but of capital importance to Germany, (5) A guarantee to the Reichsbank of a free surplus of exchange.13. Later in the discussions (while leaving open the question whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would wish to enter into a Clearing at all) I proposed, in the event of a Clearing being negotiated, a narrower basis with the object of reducing formalities and trade interference to a minimum. My proposal was that any Clearing agreement should cover :  (1) Trade between the two countries in domestic products and manufactures. (2) Provision for frozen debts.(3) An undertaking that the German Government would issue permits for the normal imports into Germany from the United Kingdom which are not essential to Germany, but are of importance to the United Kingdom (e.g., coal, herrings and textile fabrics).(4) An undertaking that the German Government would not divert from the normal channels orders for raw materials hitherto supplied through United Kingdom re-exports or from the Colonies.As regards (3) and (4), I expressed the personal view that our requirements might be covered by general undertakings without earmarking specific percentages of the Clearing account to these purposes. Subject to satisfaction on these points,, the German desire for a guaranteed surplus of exchange would be met by placing at their disposal the agreed percentage arising from the Clearing account after providing for United Kingdom exports and the provision for frozen debts. In return, the German Government would have to assure out of its general resources, augmented as they would be by the surplus from our Clearing, the continued payment of the standstill bills and the interest on the Dawes and Young Loans, with possibly something for the non-Reich loans. I made it clear that the maintenance of any such limited Clearing would have to depend on the fulfilment by the German Government of these financial obligations. My object in putting forward this proposal was to meet the difficulty that a Clearing is almost bound to require a certain period before it can work successfully and during the earlier months it is most improbable that it would have sufficient sterling to meet financial obligations due to the United Kingdom, such as the Dawes and Young Loans, and still less, to provide any balance for the re-export trade. It seemed very desirable therefore to get the Germans to agree that these liabilities should be met out of their general resources, pending greater experience as to the actual results of a Clearing.14. The reaction of the German Delegation and also of Dr. Schacht to these proposals was not unfavourable. They seemed genuinely desirous of avoiding the complexities which would arise from charging the clearing with re-exports., financial claims, &amp;c, and they emphasised repeatedly the importance which they attached to maintaining their trade connections with England. From their point of view, the cardinal question was to get agreement on what should be regarded as a normal ratio of the domestic trade between the two countries, %.e., the percentage which United Kingdom domestic exports should bear to the imports into the United Kingdom of German goods. I said that I should be prepared to recommend 60 : 100 as the normal ratio of United Kingdom exports to Germany in relation to German imports to the United Kingdom, this figure corresponding closely to the actual results of the last two and a half years.* The Germans urged that this was too favourable to the United Kingdom, as their purchasing power had now fallen, and they said that the imports from the United* Note. As the statistics of each country record imports on a o.i.f. basis and exports on a lo.b. basis, the comparison lias to be made between German exports to the United Kingdom as recorded in British statistics and British exports to Germany as recorded in the German statistics.
Kingdom during August had decreased to 37 per cent, of the German exports to the United Kingdom. They suggested at first that the ratio should be 50 : 100, but admitted that this was not their last word, and I have strong reason for thinking that agreement could be reached on a ratio of 55 : 100.15. Assuming that agreement could be reached on some such figure, the German proposal is that, out of the payments made by British importers in sterling to the Clearing account, 55 per cent, should be reserved for payment to United Kingdom exporters, and the remaining 45 per cent, should be placed at the disposal of the Reichsbank to meet its general financial obligations and the cost of re-exports. This seems a workable arrangement, but if there is a time lag in the collection of sterling from British importers there may he an interval during which the payments in Reichsmarks by the German importer may considerably exceed the sterling received from British importers. During this period, therefore, our trade might continue on a normal basis, but unpaid debts might accumulate. The Germans did not share my apprehensions on this score, and saw no reason why the collection of sterling should not from the outset cover the current claims of British exporters. But they suggested that some arrangement should be made for temporary adjustments if the actual ratio of collection departed widely from the percentage agreed as normal. They were also prepared to agree that, in addition to the 55 per cent., there should be a definite allocation for a gradual liquidation of past commercial debts, which I suggested should be not less than 10 per cent., and that if, in fact, our export trade did not absorb the full yield of the agreed normal ratio, the allocation for frozen debts should be correspondingly increased. They also were prepared to give an undertaking as to the favourable treatment (within the agreed ratio) of particular items of British exports which it was important for us to safeguard, and as to the maintenance of the normal channels of trade in regard to the purchase of raw materials through United Kingdom re-exporters, but they could not indicate without further consideration the precise terms of the declarations they could give on these points.Treatment of Standstill Bills.16. An outstanding question of considerable importance was the treatment of the Standstill obligations. In regard to this, I urged the advisability in the interests of both countries of maintaining the Standstill on 4he lilies at present in operation; and for this purpose I suggested that it should be entirely excluded from the Clearing, the Reichsbank meeting the Standstill bills out of its general resources. The Germans fully agreed as to the necessity of maintaining the Standstill, but they felt that this could best be assured by providing that Standstill bills secured on the mutual trade between the two countries should be met out of the Clearing. I said that I doubted if this would be acceptable to the British creditors and, in any case, I pointed out that it would only be practicable provided the Clearing did not have to meet any net charge in respect of such bills, i.e., if the Clearing account had to pay out the capital of any maturing bills, it would have to receive the proceeds of the replacement bills. Dr. Schacht seemed to think that this could be arranged, but he suggested that the best course would be for him to discuss the position privately with the British Standstill Committee so as to ascertain their views as to the course best calculated to preserve the position. Thus, it would appear that there is no difference between us and the German authorities on the objectives to be aimed at in dealing with the Standstill, and the only question is one of the technical machinery most likely to attain this end.Long-Term German Debts.17. A further point which might present difficulties is the payment of Germany&apos;s long-term debts. Under the agreement of last July the German Government lias undertaken to meet the full interest on the Dawes and Young-Loans up to the 31st December next, while, as regards the other loans, our bond-holders agreed to accept a funding scheme provided that they did not suffer discrimination. Since then the Swiss and Dutch have provided in their Clearing-agreements not only for full payment of interest on the Dawes and Young Loans, but also for the payment of interest on the non-Reich loans up to 4-i per cent, per annum, with a contingent allocation for the amortisation of these latter loans. Strictly speaking, therefore, our bondholders in respect of non-Reich loans had the right to insist on similar terms. But it remains to be seen whether, in fact, the
Swiss and Dutch Clearing arrangements will provide sufficient exchange to meet these claims, and our bondholders would not, I think, press very strongly for cash payments, provided that the payment of the Dawes and Young Loans is strictly maintained. I therefore confined myself to warning the Germans that the bond-holders of the non-Reich loans will very likely raise the question of obtaining Swiss terms. As regards the Dawes and Young Loans, I pointed out that their payment was essential, and if it was not assured by the German Government it would have to be assured out of the Clearing. Dr. Schacht made some difficulty about this, but the German Foreign Office officials said that the question had been settled up to the 31st December, and they thought that we had better not provoke a controversy about the future until the need arose. Their suggestion, therefore, was that for the period up to the 31st December next a limited Clearing should be established covering the mutual trade between the two countries and frozen debts, the German Government being left to fulfil its financial obligations in respect of long-term debts (and particularly the Dawes and Young Loans) under the Transfer Agreement of the 4th July out of its general resources, to which the surplus resulting from a Clearing would contribute. As regards the period after the 31st December next, either this limited Clearing should be maintained and the Transfer Agreement of last July renewed, or the Clearing agreement should be extended to cover the financial obligations of Germany.18. The alternative to such a limited clearing would be a fuller arrangement covering, in specific terms, a fairly lengthy list of items such as the following : (1) Mutual trade;(2) Interest on the Dawes and Young Loans; (3) Standstill interest; (4) Frozen trade debts;(5) Insurance freights and other invisibles; (6) Re-exports;(7) Liquidation of the Special Account established  by  the ExchangeAgreement; (8) Tourist traffic; (9) Interest on other German debt; (10) Colonial trade.It is clear that discussion on these individual items and others which may present themselves would be difficult and lengthy, whereas it is essential that any negotiations should be concluded by the 31st October next. Moreover, it is not impossible that deadlock might occur on some points in this lengthy list. But, as mentioned above, the principal objection to attempting any complete Clearing at once is that it would charge the Clearing account with a load of liabilities which during the the first few months it would almost certainly be unable to meet. From our point of view, I feel the advantage of a limited Clearing to be so great that I am surprised that the German officials showed such willingness to contemplate it.19. In conclusion, the questions which have to be decided may be summarised as follows : (1) Do His Majesty&apos;s Government accept the principle that a Clearing agreement offers the only available method of safeguarding British trading and financial interests and that it must therefore be contem-plated ?(2) If so, do His Majesty&apos;s Government agree (a) that negotiations should be resumed with a view to arriving at a limited Clearing agreement on the lines sketched out in para-graph 13 above, covering mutual trade and frozen&apos; debts, to be brought into force from the 1st November to the 31st December, the German Government meanwhile being left to assure the payment of interest on the Dawes and Young Loans ?(b) that the treatment of the Standstill bills should be settled in such manner as the British Standstill creditors and the Reichsbank may agree to be best calculated&apos; to maintain the present position provided that no net charge can be accepted on the Clearing account except, possibly, in respect of the cost of interest ?
(c) that the question whether a Clearing in this limited form should be continued after the 1st January next or whether the Clearing should then be extended to cover financial obligations would be reserved for settlement in December?(3) Do His Majesty&apos;s Government agree that 55 per cent, can be accepted as the normal proportion of the Clearing to be reserved for United Kingdom domestic exports, and that 10 per cent, can be accepted as the allocation for frozen debts?20. If His Majesty&apos;s Government agree to the above recommendations, instructions should be given the Departments concerned to work out detailed drafts both of the agreement with Germany and of the detailed measures required for putting the Clearing into force in this country. This will entail discussions between Departments (particularly the Treasury, Board of Trade and Customs and Excise) and consultations with the Bank of England and with the repre-sentatives of the British standstill and long-term creditors. I understand that the Germans will be prepared to resume negotiations at any time after the 10th October, and it will facilitate the subsequent negotiations in Berlin if the various outstanding administrative questions can be fully explored here and decisions reached as to our requirements before they start. I suggest, therefore, that the Departments should be instructed to proceed as rapidly as possible with this work, and to bring up at next week&apos;s Cabinet any further questions on which decisions are required, so that the negotiations in Berlin could be resumed about the 15th October.I may add that, during my stay in Berlin, apart from nine meetings with the German officials, headed by Dr. Ulrich of the German Foreign Office, I had interviews with Freiherr von Neurath (the Foreign Minister) and Graf von Krosigk (Finance Minister) and two long discussions with Dr. Schacht, who is now acting Minister of Commerce as well as President of the Reichsbank. Despite some difficult moments, particularly with Dr. Schacht, a very friendly atmosphere was maintained throughout all the discussions, and I believe that the German Government have a genuine desire to find an accommodation with us which will maintain the trade relations between the two countries on a mutually satisfactory basis.F. W. LEITH-ROSS.September 28, 1934.
Press Announcement published September 25. 1934.THE meetings which have been held in Berlin between the United Kingdom Delegation and the German Government representatives during the past week have been devoted to a general examination of outstanding economic and financial questions. In view of the introduction of the new German exchange regulations, and in order to avoid any disturbance of trade between the two countries during the present negotiations, the following interim arrangement has been agreed upon. This arrangement will apply until the end of October, or until the coming into force of a new arrangement, whichever is the earlier.Exchange Certificates (&quot; Devisenscheine &quot;) authorising payment into the special account of the Bank of England will be issued for the import into Germany of goods covered by the Anglo-German Exchange Agreement of the 10th August, 1934, to an extent corresponding to the present volume of British imports into Germany. No distinction will be made between individual groups of goods.This arrangement applies to all goods for which payment through the special account of the Bank of England was permissible at the time of coming into force of the Anglo-German Exchange Agreement, and to such other payments into the Account as have subsequently been approved by the Reichsbank. In other respects, the provisions of this Agreement, in particular the system of payments into the Account, remain unaltered.[For United Kingdom Press only.]In making the above announcement, which is being simultaneously made in Berlin by the German Government, the Board of Trade desire to make it plain that the foregoing arrangement is only a provisional one and that negotiations for a satisfactory settlement, both as regards trade debts and current trade, are continuing.It will be seen that for the time being the existing provisions will be maintained under the interim arrangement and no new restrictions will be placed on import of United Kingdom goods into Germany. The method of payment for all goods covered by the Anglo-German Exchange Agreement will continue to be through the special account.It should be explained that the transfer of Reichsmarks to the special account will continue to be dependent on the unsold balance of the account not exceeding 5 million Reichsmarks. The balance was reduced below this amount on the 22nd September. But while transfers to the special account were suspended, a further considerable amount of Reichsmarks has become payable to British exporters. The greater part of these are still awaiting transfer to the account, and, until they have been accepted into the account and sold, Reichsmark payments in respect of new transactions will only be noted for subsequent transfer to the Account.This position should be fully taken into consideration by exporters before arranging further shipments to Germany, Trending the outcome of the negotiations.
