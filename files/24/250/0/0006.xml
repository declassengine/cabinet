23This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. SECRET.CP.  181 (34) CABINET. Copy No...... ,TWENTY-FOUR HOUR METHOD OF EXPRESSING TIME.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Postmaster General.We desire to obtain the views of our colleagues on the question whether the Government should take any steps to secure the adoption of the 24-hour system in this country in view of the recent experiment by the British Broadcasting Corporation.This experiment has now been in operation for nearly three months, and the Corporation have represented that in the light of their experience the question of extending the system in public use should be considered by the Government.A number of Governments have considered the 24-hournotation since its adoption was urged by Lord Stonehaven&apos;sCommittee in 1919 but have decided against it .     In 1919 thegrounds for the rejection of the system were stated by theCommittee of Home Affairs as follows:-&quot;It was pointed out that no economy in writing would be effected  ... that there was no demand in the country for a change   ... and that while it was open to the Government to require the Army and the Navy to use whatever system the Government might favour,  it was not open to them to interfere with the established habits of the public for no tangible advantage.      Nothing was likely to cause greater offence to the voter than to force on him a new and, at first sight,   complicated method of expressing the time of day, and by doing so the Government would lose many thousands of votes, while no real benefit would accrue to the country.&quot;The Labour Cabinet of 1931 also agreed to take no action .So far as the British Broadcasting Corporation^ experiment is concerned, the Corporation states that taking into account the difficulties attending the innovation,  it
regards the experiment as successful.     But it has received over 3,000 written protests against only 400 appreciations and the circulation of the &quot;Radio Times&quot; suffered a definite set-back when the 24-hour notation was adopted in its programme.     We understand that a number of public bodies have expressed themselves in favour of adopting the new method,  including the Association of British Chambers of Commerce,  the Federation of British Industries, the Central Electricity Board,  Imperial Airways, the Railway Companies Association, as well as the War Office, Admiralty and Air Force.The House of Lords recently passed a motion proposed by Lord Newton in favour of the adoption by the Post Office of the new system.      A majority of the Post Office Advisory Council was also in favour of the change.If the matter is to be pursued with the expressed approval of the Government the 24-hour notation would have to be adopted sooner or later for pillar boxes, postmarks, time-tables and other media in common use.      The total cost to the Post Office would be of the order of  20,000.      There would also have to be a preliminary conference of the various interested parties,  but action would no doubt have to be initiated by the responsible Government Departments. Legislation would not be necessary.J . G . K.W .7th July,  1934
