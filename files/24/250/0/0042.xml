219Private and ConfidentialREPORTon Investigation into Derelict Areas of South Wales and MonmouthshireTo The Right Honourable Sir Henry B. Betterton, Bart., C.B.E., M.P., Minister of Labour
The Right Honourable Sir Henry Betterton, C.B.E., M.P., Minister of Labour.Sir,I have the honour to present my Report on the Derelict Areas in South Wales which I was requested on your behalf to investigate and furnish my findings.I should like to take the opportunity of bringing to your notice the invaluable assistance I have received, both in my investigations and in the preparation of the Report, from Mr. Pierce Jones (the Divisional Controller of the Ministry of Labour) ; &apos; Mr. James Evans (late General Inspector of the Ministry of Health for Wales) ; Mr. W. M. Forrest (Ministry of Labour) and Mr. C. J. German (Ministry of Labour) who have acted as my Secretary and Assistant Secretary respectively, together with other officers in the Wales Divisional Office of the Ministry who have taken part in the work necessary to enable me to complete the duties entrusted to me.I would also like to state how impressed I have been by the esteom and respect in which the gentlemen named above have been held by all the Local Authorities, etc., which I have met in the area, as I realise that they must, during the past few years, have performed a very difficult task in somewhat trying circumstances. For my own part, I have been received in all parts of the district with the greatest friendliness by all sections of the community, and though one may be disposed to discount a little of it on the ground that some of those interested may have been under the impression that I had been sent down to Wales to confer a measure of benefit to themselves, yet, in spite of that, I feel the fact is worth)&apos; of comment.You will see from the map (showing the incidence of unemploy-ment, Local Authority Rates, etc.) enclosed with my Report, that I have pursued the investigations in an area which I think one could say safely was the most depressed in South Wales, and I have taken the boundary lines so as to keep the Steam and House Coal Trade separated broadly from the Tinplate and the Anthracite Coal districts. The only exception is the reference made to the Township of Pembroke (including Pembroke Dock) where, for reasons explained in the Report, I thought it advisable to devote attention. I have thus taken the area which, in my opinion, would justify any special consideration which H.M. Government may wish to afford to the South Wales Coalfield.
I have divided the Report into various sections giving conclusions and recommendations under each head, and summarising the recommendations in the concluding chapter. It will also be seen that in the section devoted to a review of the labour problem I have made use of statistical appendices to amplify the points raised, whereas in the other divisions, tabulated figures have not been used largely, as they are available already by the Government Depart-ments concerned.A list of the Local Authorities, Public Bodies, and individuals representing particular interests seen by me during the course of the investigations, is appended.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,WYNDHAM PORTAL.London,2nd July, 1934.(14560 C)

SECTION ICHARACTERISTICS OF THE AREAWe were asked to give a brief summary on this subject.1. An appreciable percentage of the people whom I met during the course of the investigation were members of Local Authorities or attached to Unemployed or Welfare Clubs.2. I found them very intelligent, with a thorough grasp of all duties and functions falling on their Councils. Both on the County Councils and the Urban District Councils, I was much impressed with the fact that they spoke on their subjects without any reference to the permanent officials, which is quite unlike my experience in the Southern Counties of England. They have been trained in a political atmosphere unlike my experience in any part of England. They knew a great deal about national politics and what is going on in other parts of the country. They were very easy to get on with, possibly owing to the fact that they considered that I had come down with authority to give them anything th?y were seeking. I spent a great deal of the time explaining this away. They have grievances, but for all that, they are cheerful and considering most of them have been out of work for a long time their outlook on life is not as bad as one would expect.3. I am very much impressed with the great difficulty of having unemployed men as members of public bodies, as I consider that this is an impossible situation. I came across one Urban District Council, in whose area there was a vacancy for a school attendance officer, where some of the members of the Council were actually standing for the job.4. It was also noticeable how very much in touch the local Members of Parliament were with the Urban District Councils. In three or four cases they asked their local M.P.s to be present at the meetings which I attended. I regard the area as suffering from the disadvantage of not having the outstanding type of people resident in the district, which they had in years gone by.
SECTION IIUNEMPLOYMENT (AND COGNATE ISSUES) IN THE AREA REVIEW OF LABOUR PROBLEMDefinition.of the Area1. I give below a list of Local Offices of the Ministry of Labour in the area of South Wales and Monmouthshire which has been scheduled by the Ministry as Depressed. This area comprises, broadly, the whole of the South Wales Coalfield : (Note. Coal Mining obtains or obtained in the areas of all the above Local Offices with the exception of Kidwelly. The letter A set against individual Local Offices indicates that the Iron, Steel, Galvanised Sheet and Kindred Industries is (or has been recently) carried on in the areas, and similarly the letter B represents the Tinplate Industry.)2. On arrival in South Wales I examined the unemployment statistics for the area, and after consultation with various bodies and individuals, I reached the conclusion for the reasons stated below, that having regard to the object of my investigation, it would be appropriate to concentrate on the area from the Eastern Valley of Monmouthshire to and including Port Talbot on the East, bounded on the North by the Breconshire boundary, and excluding Cardiff, Penarth, Barry, Llantwit Major and Porthcawl on theEastern SectionWestern Section Ammanford B.

seaboard in the South. This area is marked clearly on the map attached. I had some hesitation in including Port Talbot in the Eastern Section, as employment in the Iron, Steel and Tinplate Industry is relatively good, but on the other hand localities adjoining Port Talbot and coming within the administrative area of the Local Office have suffered severely through the closing down of collieries and a tinplate works.3. This covers the greater portion of the scheduled depressed area and will for convenience be referred to, hereafter, as the Eastern Section. The portion west of Port Talbot will be described as the Western Section. The principal reasons which have influenced me in concentrating on the Eastern Section of the depressed areas are :-(a) The percentage of unemployment in the Eastern section is at present about 44-5 per cent, as compared with 28-6 per cent, in the Western Section.(b) The Eastern Section depends substantially on the exportof steam coal and for the reasons stated in Section III of my report, the export trade in this class of coal has contracted seriously. Under existing conditions it seems to be doubtful whether a substantial recovery in the near future can be anticipated. The Western Section of the Coalfield produces anthracite coal and in recent years there has been an increasing demand for this class of coal, the output last year reaching 6,127,000 tons, which I am informed is a record. Further, in the Neath area a new Colliery which has been opened within recent years will be absorbing additional men, and the sinking of a new pit in this area is under contemplation.(c) The Industrial Survey which has been undertaken inconnection with this Inquiry shows that in the Western Section 67,200 men were employed in the basic industries in 1927. The number now employed is 5S.700 including men working short time. The absorbing capacity of the basic industries, given favourable trade conditions, is 67,700 so that on statistics alone there are potential openings for practically all the men now unemployed, but it will be realised that on account of age, etc., a proportion of the men are not likely to re-enter industry.(d) Responsible people, whom I have been able to consult onthis phase are, in general, in agreement that mainly because of the consistent demand for anthracite coal and the existence of other Industries the outlook in the Western Section is definitely brighter than in the other parts of the coalfield.
(e) Taking the length of the period of unemployment as a basis of comparison I find in the Eastern Section that 11 6 per cent, men have been unemployed for over five years as against 4-5 per cent, in the Western Section.(/) While the population in the Eastern Section is declining, a slight increase is reflected in the West. As the Investi-gation proceeded the information which was made available to me from day to day confirmed, generally, that the division of the depressed area, as described above, could be regarded as reasonably sound.4. The main field to be embraced by my Investigation having been decided, I considered next whether in this area there were any localities which might be described as derelict. These deeper pockets of unemployment would be represented by township or village, once industrially prosperous, but where the abandonment of a Coal Mine or Steel Works in recent years has meant the loss of virtually the sole large-scale wage-giving employment in the community. Such places as Blaina, Brynmawr, Rhymney, Merthyr, Dowlais, Ebbw Vale and Senghenydd appear to stand out from-nently as examples in this category. So far as coal is concerned, the majority of the Collieries in Blaina, Brynmawr, Dowlais and the upper end of Merthyr, have been worked out and abandoned. Nothing definite can be said about Ebbw Vale until it is known whether, or not, the Iron and Steel Works will re-open. If this establishment is not put into commission the situation in this area will remain serious. At Dowlais, it is definite that the Steel Works wdll not restart, but as stated in Section IV there is a possibility (though somewhat remote in point of time) of 500 of the unemployed steel workers being absorbed in the new Cardiff-Dowlais Works after the local unemployed iron and steel workers have been given the opportunity of employment.5. When I turn to look at other large districts such as the Rhondda, where Collieries are still working (or are closed down temporarily), I find that the contraction in the production of coal is so serious that whilst in these places the percentage of unemploy-ment reflected is not so high as in the areas instanced as &quot; derelict &quot; the actual number of workpeople left without employment is much higher.6. In paragraph 17 below, reference is made to the number of men who are travelling substantial distances daily to and from their places of employment. Having regard to the transport facilities now available in the Welsh Valleys, I consider that the area under survey may properly be regarded as one unit, and in working out the problem as a whole, it is difficult to separate even the most

I considered it necessary to ascertain as far as practicable the capacity of the various districts to absorb workers who are unemployed, assuming that trade would revive sufficiently to enable existing Collieries and plant to be used to their fullest capacity, but leaving out of account possible developments.9. With this end in view the Local Officers of the Ministry of Labour concerned were requested to cany out local enquiries anddepressed areas at the top of the Valleys (which might be described as &quot; derelict &quot;) from the remainder of this portion of the South Wales Coalfield.(Note. Hereafter my Report deals only with the Eastern Section of the Depressed Area, except where Comparisons with the Western Section are made).Basic Industries in the Eastern Area7. The statistical table which follows shows that the working population in the area depends almost entirely for their livelihood on the Coal Industry, with a small proportion dependent on the Iron, Steel and Tinplate Industries : -
supply statistics and reports in respect of the basic industries (coal, iron, steel and tinplate) in both the Eastern and Western Sections of the scheduled depressed area. As we know, the mining of coal is, or was, a stable industry in all districts, and the areas in which iron, steel and tinplate plant is, or was, established is marked appropriately against the names of the Local Offices appearing in paragraph 1 of this Section of the Report.10. The information collated indicates that the basic industries provide employment at the present time for approximately 125,000 workers, including those working intermittently. In 1927 the same industries gave employment to about 183,000 workpeople. The potential capacity of existing industrial concerns to provide employment appears to have contracted considerably since that date, and the information made available shows that without extension or development the coal, iron, steel and tinplate industries are not capable of providing for more than 164,000 workers if a demand for their products can be created.11. According to the Ministry of Labour statistics 53,000 work-people attached to these industries are recorded as wholly un-employed, but this does not take into account the men who, in times of prosperity, were working in the industries and who, during times of depression, have changed their normal occupations for the sake of obtaining work of a more or less casual nature, and who, on again becoming unemployed have remained registered as belong-ing to the occupation they adopted temporarily. For this reason we must take into our calculation in reaching an estimate of the real surplus, the total number of unemployed in the area, which is 81,000, as a large proportion of these can be regarded as being attached to or concerned in the prosperity of the basic industries.12. As mentioned above it would appear that the employment position obtaining in the year 1927 is not likely to be regained, and the existing basic industries under favourable conditions are capable of employing only 39,000 more workers than they do at present.13. Appendix O shows by industries how these statistics are made up and it is estimated that the Collieries alone could absorb about 34,000 of this total. On the basis of an output of 250 tons per man per annum, 4,000 men would produce one million tons, so that an increase in the demand for coal to the extent of say, four million tons, would give employment to 16,000 colliers, a fair proportion of the colliery workers now unemployed. But in this connection we must remember that on the 24th April, 1S.000 of the colliers included in the number regarded as in employment were temporarily suspended or working short time.
14. I have stated in Section V that I cannot conceive new industries of any size (apart from the setting up of plant for the extraction of oil from coal) being established in this area and whilst I am putting forward for consideration an extension of small-holding schemes and increased afforestation, the number of men who would be absorbed would represent only a very small pro-portion of the total now unemployed.15. It is obviously impossible under existing economic conditions to determine the actual surplus, but for the purpose of reaching an estimate, I am going to assume that trade will revive sufficiently to enable industry in the area to work to a normal full capacity, and if this occurred the minor industries (e.g., building, works of construction (including Public Works) and distributive trades) would receive a corresponding stimulus and might absorb say, 3,000 men. It is thus possible that 42,000 of the existing unemployed will be absorbed locally into industry, leaving a permanent surplus of at least 39,000, and the problem arising therefrom is discussed in the paragraphs which follow.16. I would like to emphasise again that for the purpose of arriving at this figure the following factors should be borne in mind : (a) It is assumed that trade will revive sufficiently to enableindustry to work to existing normal capacity.(b) A substantial number of men in the basic industries are working short time and the first effect of a revival in trade would probably result only in a proportion of these men resuming full time employment.(c) It is assumed that a revival in the basic industries will result in more employment being available in the minor industries.Possible developments in Collieries and other concerns have not been taken into account and no allowance has been made for the possible establishment of plant for new uses of coal or for the absorption of men in small-holdings and afforestation, issues which I have discussed more fully in other sections of this Report.Mobility of Labour in Area17. During recent years labour within the area has become very mobile and thiough force of circumstances large numbers of men are now travelling daily between their homes and their places of employment. The enquuies made show that in a few cases men are even travelling as much as 20 mdes each way. All this has been made possible by the excellent system of rail and motor transport services available in these valleys and it is also the practice for bodies of men, by arrangement amongst themselves,, to contract for special motor transport to and from their homes.
In the Section dealing with &quot; pockets &quot; of unemployment, the question of shortages and surplus in particular areas is discussed at greater length.Extent of Unemployment18. In the Eastern Section of South Wales and Monmouthshire (as denned already) the insured population is 250,310. The number of women and juveniles registered as unemployed on 14th May, 1934, was 6,525, a relatively small figure to which I have not applied any special analytical examination. The number of temporary stoppage workers registered was 22,538 this figure, it has been explained to me, fluctuates and the personnel changes continually. These &quot; T.S. &quot; men I have assumed could be employed full time when the general demand improves further. I have obtained, however, through the assistance of the Ministry of Labour, a special detailed analysis of the records of the 80,661 wholly unemployed men registered on 14th May, 1934, at the Local Offices of the Ministry in the area under review.19. The analysis reveals the duration of unemployment, the age, and marital state of the wholly unemployed register. Appendix A contains a summary for the Eastern and Western Sections and the figures are also separately shown in Appendices B and C. These statistics have been specially classified in two age groups (according to length of unemployment) in Appendices D. E, and F for the respective areas.20. The wholly unemployed register has also been separately analysed in five main industrial divisions Colliery Workers (Appendix L), Iron and Steel Workers (Appendix M), Tinplate Workers (Appendix N), all other skilled workers (Appendix O), and other unskilled workers (Appendix P).Duration of Unemployment21. One of the most serious aspects of the unemployment problem in this area is the high proportion of the wholly unemployed register, which reflects long periods of continuous unemployment. An appreciable number of men will unquestionably need recon-reconditioning before they can hope to regain their full value as industrial units. If the men who have been without regular work for as long as three years are to be considered for reconditioning, this amounts to 2S.490 men or 35-3 per cent, of the Wholly Unemployed register in the area. If the period of two years unemployment is taken, approximately 44,250 men are involved. These men, however, fall into two classes according to age; the training and reconditioning of men under 45 are dealt with in paragraphs 36 and 43. I find that as many as 9.3S4 men, or 11-6 per cent, of the Wholly Unemployed register have been without regular employment for more than five years.

The most favourably placed group in Table is that of &quot; other skilled workers.&quot; The groups with the greatest volume of labour, the colliery workers and &quot; other unskilled workers&quot; are very similar as regards the incidence of long periods of unemployment, and these naturally approximate to the general summary for the area.24. With regard to the Iron and Steel workers it is evident that the bulk of the unemployment dates from about three years ago. The Iron and Steel Works at Ebbw Vale were closed in 1929, and the main section of the Dowlais Works closed in 1930, and this accounts for 2,000 men who, on the loss of their employment three or four years ago, have had no regular work since.25. I have examined similar analyses of the Wholly Unemployed Register in the areas of four Local Offices of the Ministry of Labour selected as representing some of the blackest spots in the whole of the coalfield. The figures for Blaina, Brynmawr, Ebbw Vale and Merthyr are set out in Appendices G, H, I, and J.26. In Blaina and Merthyr the percentage of men who have been unemployed over four years is 21-2 per cent and 23-1 per cent.Duration of Unemployment in Main Industrial Divisions22. The following table compUed from Appendices L, M, N, O, P, compares the duration of unemployment experienced by the wholly unemployed men signing the register on 14th May, 1934, in the five main industrial divisions. It should be explained that for the purposes of this analysis and in corresponding tables below, short spells of employment (Relief work and other employment of a casual nature, i.e., short spells of employment that do not affect to an appreciable degree the real position of the man&apos;s record of work) have been ignored.TABLE
respectively or approximately double the percentage for the Eastern Section of the Coalfield, and in Brynmawr the percentage is 36-8 per cent., or more than treble the Eastern Section percentage. In Ebbw Vale 87-3 per cent, of the Wholly Unemployed Register have been unemployed for more than 12 months. The over-all percentage of unemployment in Blaina, Brynmawr and Merthyr is 71 -4 per cent., 72-5 per cent., and 67-6 per cent, respectively, which compares unfavourably with the percentage of 44-5 per cent, for the Coalfield.Extent and Duration of Unemployment in comparison of Selected AreasA.

An analysis of the Wholly Unemployed men in two age groups (a) under 45 years and (b) over 45 years reveals that in the whole of the Eastern Section 64 per cent, of the men fall within group (a) and 36 per cent within group (b). It is found that in the five industrial groups selected, there is but little variation in the age distribution of the unemployed. The only marked difference relates to workers of the Tinplate Trade and &quot; other skdled &quot; workers where the proportion of men in group (a) is as high as 75 per cent, and 73 per cent, respectively.

Transference of Labour28. I have already said that there seems to be but little hope of new industries coming to this area, and any expansion of the basic industries wdl certainly not absorb all the men who are now unemployed. A proportion of the persons now unemployed (paragraph 15) must consequently be regarded as surplus to requirements, and their only hope of securing employment is to move to a new area.29. In order to arrive at some estimate of the number of men who may be regarded as within the transferable field, I have divided the unemployed men into two age groups : (a) 18 to 45.(b) Over 45.This is a somewhat arbitrary division, but it is, I think, true to say that the opportunities for securing employment in a new area tend to diminish after a man (without any skill or qualification to meet a demand in the specific new industry) attains his forty-sixth birthday.30. I find that 51,628 men (or 64 per cent.) are in the age group 18 to 45, and of this number 29,316 (or 36-3 per cent.) are married, and here again under normal circumstances transference of the married man is necessarily restricted, notwithstanding the assistance available under the Household Removal Scheme of the Ministry of Labour. In the same age group, 22,312 (or 22-7 per cent.) are single men.The number of men over 45 years of age is 29,033 (or 36 per cent.) of the total, and of this number 21,922 (or 27-2 per cent.) are married and 7,110 (or S-S per cent.) are single.31. Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, the three large County Boroughs in South Wales, are themselves suffering from severe unemployment, being dependent to a large extent on the coal trade for their prosperity, and there is not much hope that appreciable numbers from the adjoining coalfield can be absorbed within their boundaries.32. Whilst possible developments in the Anthracite Section of the coalfield may in time provide opportunities for employment to men in the Eastern Section of the coalfield, it is evident that the real flow of transference must, in the immediate present, necessarily be towards the^Midlands and South of England.33. Whdst in these circumstances, I advocate transference on the largest possible scale, I appreciate that regard must be paid to the conditions existing in other parts of the country and the issue is one which must be left to the Ministry of Labour to keep a close watch on the position so as to ensure that no opportunity is lost of finding openings for these men in areas which are showing signs of trade recovery.   The transference policy means that the cream
of the population will be taken from the depressed districts, leaving the older and less adaptable people to bear the burden of existing social services, and I have dealt with this aspect of the question in Section IX of the Report.34. At many meetings which I attended I found a measure of resentment that the young and able-bodied should be in the necessity of leaving the district to find employment, and as stated in Section V the view was held that Government should, as an alternative to transference, take any essential steps to obtain control and direction in the allocation of new industries, having regard to the claims of the depressed areas. I am not in agreement with these representations.35. Elsewhere in this section of my Report it is assumed that 42,000 of the 81,009 men who are wholly unemployed may in the future have an opportunity of obtaining employment locally. If this is the case, what proportion of these men are likely to be within the ages of 18 and 45 ? In the age groups over 45 years we have 29,000 men ; 13,000 of these are over 55 years of age and because of the heavy character of the industries in the area they have little hope of obtaining employment. It might, therefore, be assumed reasonably that 75 per cent, of the 42,000 who may obtain work locally will be between the ages of 18 and 45, a total of 31,500 men. When this figure is deducted from the 51,500 in the age group 1S-45, it leaves 20,000 men who, broadly speaking, may be regarded as in the field for transference and training.36. Attached to the question of the transfer of men between 18-45 years of age to ordinary industrial employment in a new area, the industrial fitness of the man is a phase which ought not to be overlooked. Taking the whole field into account the statistics on Appendix E show that 35.S68 (or 44-7 per cent.) men (married and single) have had no regular employment for more than one year and 25,047 (or 31 per cent.) for more than two years. Whilst it is true that many of these men may, by working on allotments, attending Occupational Centres, or indulging in sport, have kept themselves fit, there must, I feel, be a definite proportion of them who would, if found employment, find difficulty in holding down a job, and in whose cases a course of reconditioning at an Instructional Centre would be helpful. It may well be, if the flow of transference does increase, that additional reconditioning centres may need to be made available, both in the depressed areas and in other parts of the country, but the policy here must depend necessarily upon the capacity of the more prosperous areas to absorb additional numbers into wage-earning employment.Training Centres for Adults37. Men. The Ministry of Labour Training Centres will be called upon to play an increasingly important part under any extensive
scheme of Industrial Transference, and it is obvious that a Course at a Government Training Centre, apart from giving to a man a knowledge of a new occupation, helps to pave the way from the depressed to the more prosperous areas.38. In discussing the Training Centres with outside bodies and individuals, the view was expressed fairly generally that the present Course was too short and that the man should remain in training for a period of from nine to twelve months.I am inclined to sympathise with this view and suggest that the Ministry should consider the grouping of these Courses in two sections, namely (1) training in occupations dependent entirely on individual skill or craftsmanship, e.g., carpenter, painter, hairdresser, etc., and (2) occupations attached to mechanised processes.In the case of the latter, six months course may be sufficient, but for the occupations dependent on the individual skill of the man, a longer course would appear necessary.39. I understand that the Ministry of Labour increase their existing classes and introduce new classes according to the current labour demand in industry, a policy with which I am in agreement, and the Ministry will no doubt continue to watch the position closely, so that no opportunity is lost for the training of men in occupations which are likely to provide reasonable prospects of employment in the future.40. Local Authorities and other outside interests represented to me that instead of taking the young men away to train them in other parts of the country, Training Centres should be established in South Wales. I understand that the policy of the Ministry of Labour is to establish these Centres in the more prosperous areas where there are opportunities for placing men direct into employment, apart altogether from the fact that leaving home for a distant Training Centre provides a much easier &quot; break &quot; with their old surroundings. So far as the Centres which afford training in specified occupations are concerned, I am in agreement with this policy.41. Further, in certain circumstances, the Unemployment Assistance Board might consider whether it would not be in the interest of the younger men in receipt of Unemployment Assistance who have come from the &quot; depressed &quot; areas, and have lost their employment, to require them to enter a course of training or reconditioning in the new area rather than they should return to their homes where there would be no real prospect of employment.42. I understand it is necessary to reject an appreciable number of applicants for training because they lack or have forgotten the elementary rules of arithmetic, etc., and/or have not the mental agility to assimdate the intensive six months course which obtains at a Government Training Centre.(14560 C) c
It has been suggested to me that it would be useful to establish a Preparatory Training Centre in some of the most seriously depressed areas with a view to fitting such men to enter a Government Training Centre, and thus providing more opportunities for men to transfer from the depressed areas. I think it would be useful for the Ministry of Labour to experiment on these lines and I suggest that in the event of such a Centre being established in South Wales it should be situated at Merthyr or Tonypandy.43. In regard to Instructional or Reconditioning Centres, however, I see no reason why additional Centres on the lines of the Rheola Centre should not be established in South Wales, particularly if the revival of trade in other parts of the country admits the possibility of a larger measure of transference. As stated in the conclusions in para. 36, I think that appreciable numbers of men, before they can be regarded as suitable for transfer to industrial employment in other districts, would benefit by attendance at Centres of this nature.44. Women. Unemployment amongst women in South Wales does not present a very serious problem, so far as numbers registered at Employment Exchanges may be taken as reflecting the position.Apart from a comparatively small number of openings in the tinplate trade no industrial openings for women exist or have ever existed in the area under review. The total number of insured women in the area is about 14,000; the total number of women registered at Employment Exchanges as unemployed (i.e., insured and uninsured such as domestic) forms 22-3 per cent, of the number of insured women, unemployment being more marked in the Eastern than in the Western half.45. In prosperous times, womenfolk in the mining valleys normally remained at home doing domestic tasks, but owing to the acute depression many are now compelled to earn a living ; in the absence of industrial openings they seek domestic work, permanent or seasonal, which, owing to the restricted number of domestic vacancies in the region, they must seek at holiday resorts and in the principal towns in Wales, London and South Western Counties. A large number of women have already done this, and those who are registered for employment at Local Offices of the Department are confined largely to the distributive and commercial groups for whom work in their home district is not easily obtained.46. At some of the meetings I have attended, the problem of dealing with unemployment amongst women has been stressed, and it has been suggested that in transferring women and girls to industrial employment, the Ministry of Labour should satisfy themselves that suitable Hostel accommodation at reasonable rates is available in the new area, and where such accommodation is not available, and appreciable numbers of women are being transferred, the Ministry should take steps to set up Hostels. I want to say that I am in sympathy with this suggestion.
47. It would appear that the solution to the problem of un-employment amongst women in Wales seems to lie in some Scheme for assisted transference (e.g., free railway warrants and maintenance subsidy in certain cases) to commercial and factory employment in the more prosperous areas. I am aware that Residential and Non-Residential Centres for the training of women in domestic employment have been established by the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Training and Employment, but the representations made to me suggest that it might be desirable to introduce more specialised courses of domestic training for cooks, waitresses, generals, etc., to meet the seasonal demand of holiday resorts.48. Juveniles. According to the 1931 Census Returns, there should be 35,667 boys and 34,774 girls, between the ages of 14 and 18 in the Eastern Section of the depressed area. It is possible to estimate the number of these who are still in schools of various kinds, and who are in employment which is insurable at present (16-18 age group), and which will be insurable when the new Unemployment Insurance Bill becomes Law (14-16 age group). An estimate may also be formed of the number of boys and girls who have been transferred out of the area since 1930, and who are still in the 14-18 age group.   These estimates are : 	Boys.	Girls.In schools of various kinds (14 to 18		years of age)	7,950	7,430In insurable employment (16 to 18 age		group)          ........	11,000	1,615In employment insurable under New		Bill (14 to 16 age group)	9,250	1,210Transferred out of area (now 14 to 16		years of age)	2,000	3,000Total	30,200	13,25549. If these totals are subtracted from the Census figures we are left with, approximately, 5,500 boys and 21,500 girls within the area who are either unemployed, in uninsurable employment, or in the case of girls, not likely ever to enter wage-earning employment.50. The present unemployed register figures for area under review are 3,083 boys and 1,164 girls.The insured population (boys) is 12,270 and this figure taken against the Live Register shown above gives an unemployed percentage of 21 -5.(14560 C)
The insured population on the girls&apos; side is 1,760, giving a percentage of unemployment of 66-0.It will be appreciated that the Live Register figures include a proportion of juveniles in the 14-16 age group who are not now insurable, and this factor applies specially in the case of girls.51. The number of boys who go into uninsurable employment is not large and there are probably about 5,000 boys in the area unemployed. It should be borne in mind, however, that about 2,000 boys in elementary schools, and 1,000 boys in secondary schools remain there simply because openings in commerce and industry are not available, and the real dimensions of the boys&apos; problem may be of greater magnitude. The 1,000 boys in secondary schools constitute a special problem, as they are of more mature age, and unless special efforts are made there is but little hope of suitable employment being provided for them.52. In regard to girls, after making allowance for those who never expect to seek work outside the home, there remains a number, not easily denned, who desire employment in commerce or industry, or in domestic service.53. At the present time there appears little prospect of absorbing these juveniles into local industries, and it must be remembered that the numbers in the 14-1S age groups will increase until the year 1937. After making allowances for any local revival of trade, it seems likely that the surplus of boys in the area under survey will not fall far short of 5.0Q0.54. During the course of my investigation I visited the Junior Instruction Centres (Boys and Girls) at Abertillery, and was much impressed by the nature of the activities which prevailed.I am told that there are 17 Centres of this type for Boys in South Wales, two for Girls, and two mixed Centres, and that the Ministry propose, under the provision of the imminent Unemployment Insurance Act, to establish a larger number.I feel that Instructional and Welfare Work of this description is definitely helpful towards meeting some of the difficulties now attendant on unemployment amongst juveniles, and I was convinced both from observation and information submitted to me, that these Centres form a real contribution, in difficult times, to the problem of enforced idleness on the part of boys and girls resident in these areas.
22955. The primary solution appears to be transference, which, I think, should remain on a voluntary basis, and it remains a matter of importance to determine what means can be adopted to facilitate the absorption of the juveniles into suitable employment in other areas. Consideration should, I think, be given to the following points : (1) The continuance of the present provision of domestic training centres for girls, and the establishment of vocational training centres for boys (e.g., in such occupations as chefs and waiters).(2) The continuance of the existing facilities of free railway warrants and grants in aid of maintenance, as now provided by the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund. I am doubtful about the feasibility of raising money for this purpose from voluntary sources. I think, further, that the present obligation on the employer to contribute towards maintenance should be continued.In the light of the observations made in other sections of my Report, I consider that these facilities, for the present, should be confined to the distressed mining area.(3) If attendance at Junior Instruction Centres is to be extended to cover juveniles travelling from distances greater than they do at present, it may be necessary to give consideration to the practicability, in co-operation with Education Authorities or Voluntary Organisations, of making some provision for a midday meal.Pockets of Unemployment56. Within the boundaries of the Eastern area defined in this report, there are a number of townships where the incidence of unemployment has in recent years been so heavy as to throw them into bold relief.These communities have, in popular usage, come to be termed &quot; derelict,&quot; and such centres as Blaina, Blaenavon, BrynmawT, Dowlais, Ebbw Vale, Merthyr, Rhymney and Senghenydd are typical of what is accepted as examples of this category.As I have mentioned in other parts of the Report, it is not, however, so easy to preserve a distinction in this sense which can, in fact, be regarded as governing the real position.57. It is clear that there has been, and must continue to be a consistent contact between the places mentioned and the sur-rounding area, so far as fluidity of labour movement is concerned,
and it is necessary to emphasise that not one of these communities, made &quot;derelict&quot; by the abandonment of a staple industry in their immediate confines, is so isolated as to place the residents in such a position as to leave them without any access to potential employ-ment which may exist, or which may be promoted, within a reasonable travelling distance of their homes.58. In the statistical Appendices attached to this Report, Appendix Q gives a number of figures prepared by the Ministry of Labour in respect of the Eastern Section of the area, and an endeavour has been made to ascertain by local enquiry, the measure of the absorbing capacity in the main industries with a view to determining so far as practicable what ought to be regarded as real &quot; surpluses &quot; of labour in each district.59. To take the main industry only (that is coalmining) it will be seen that the number of workpeople now employed in the industry has since July, 1927, fallen by about 53,000.Approaches were made to all the Colliery Owners in the area, designed to elicit information as to the number of workpeople additional to the 110,000 now gainfully occupied, who could be employed if each colliery resumed normal working capacity.It was made clear that the information given should not include reference to any developments of pits or districts of pits, but should be confined simply to the working places now available for the production of coal if the industrial position generally improved with a consequential increased demand for coal.It is significant to note that in the aggregate the estimates so obtained reach a figure of 34,000 men.60. Statistics relating to the remaining main industries in the district are, as will be seen, included in Appendix Q.61. The table which follows gives by (a) geographical districts, and (b) areas of the Local Offices of the Ministry of Labour in those districts, an estimate of the &quot; surplus &quot; likely to be left on the Local Office register if trade recovery resulted in the absorption of about 42,000 men, and full time employment being available for the men now working intermittently.   (See paragraph 15.)For instance, the survey shows that if the collieries in the AbertiUery district were to work at normal capacity there would be a shortage locally of colliery workers and it has been assumed that the reserve of Colliery labour in Blaina and Brynmawr will be drawn upon to make good this shortage ; thus reducing sub-stantially the existing surplus in these areas.

The statistics in columns 3 and 4 relate to 14th May, 1934, and reflect an increase in the number of men on the &quot; Temporary Stoppage &quot; Register as corn-pared with the Unemployment Statistics given in paragraph 7 when are in respect of 24th April, 1934.62. It is hardly necessary to say that the figures given above should not be accepted without clue reserve. In the first place, as explained in paragraph 59 above, the potential absorbing capacity can be approximate only, and it is clear, further, that recovery in the basic industries of the area, at best, is problematical, and may, if it obtains, have direct effect on certain localities only. It is not unlikely also that gains in one area may be off-set by losses in others. In addition, it is important to note that the Live Register figures at the Ministry of Labour Local Offices, for this purpose, have been accepted without any attempt to assess the &quot; suitability&quot; or &quot; employment value &quot; of the applicants.In this connection, reference is made to paragraphs IS to 26 dealing with the extent, nature and duration of unemployment.
The figures in the table represent simply the number of men registered for employment, and a much closer examination of the Registers would be required to determine what properly could be said on the primary issue of adaptability and suitability (with or without a course of training) of the applicants for any potential employment, in the sense discussed in this section of the Report.This, of course, is of material importance, as the employment likely to be found generally in the area as in the heavy basic industries.The percentage figures in Column 6 are, however, an index indicative of the broad effect in each area if and when industry in the Eastern Section is producing to normal capacity.63. On the other hand, given a substantial increase in the demand for coal, it is probable that in some areas there would be a shortage of skilled and semi-skilled workmen, which could not be met from areas within daily travelling distance, and the same position might arise simdarly in the Iron, Steel and Tinplate industries.64. Accepting fully the limitations of the statistics furnished, it will be seen, however, that the distribution of what may, at the moment, be considered as the surplus of labour over estimated potential requirements, the significant figures (in point of volume of unemployment) are not confined to the communities mentioned in paragraph 56 above, but are found against such ^areas as Caerphdly (which includes Senghenydd) *Maesteg, Tonypandy, and Pontypridd.Residual Problem65. Before proceeding to deal with the problem of the labour residue in the area, it may be convenient to. summarise, briefly, the facts and conclusions discussed in the preceding paragraphs : (a) Total number of men wholly unemployed inthe area ..........SI,000(b) Estimated  number  of  men  who  may  be absorbed locally given a revival in trade  ..    42,000(c) Assuming local absorption  as  at   (b),  thenumber of men who may be regarded as apermanent surplus........    39,000      Analysis o  (a)(if) Total number of men between the ages of IS by Age groups and 45 ..       ..       ........    51,500(e) Total number of men between the ages of : (i) 46-55        ...... 16,500(ii) Over 55 years      ..       . . 13,000-    29,500* Note. It may be stated that owing to contemplated colliery develop-ments in the Dulais Valley (Neath district) a measure of relief may be afforded to the Maesteg area, though at present the plans are in a preparatory stage only, and no information is available as to when the undertakings are likely to need the services of colliery workpeople.

As regards women and girls, it is difficult to arrive at an estimate of the surplus, but. it can be taken that the economic conditions in the home and the absence of opportunities for local employment, are factors which influence a considerable number to look outside Wales for a livelihood).66. It wUl be seen, leaving aside issues attached to the unemploy-ment of women and girls, it is estimated that in the area under survey, out of the figure of 39,000 given in paragraph (c) above, about 19,000 men of mature age are regarded as surplus to potential industrial requirements. In addition the problem remains of the 20,000 men (married and single) in the younger age groups and 5,000 boys below IS for whom employment is not likely to be available readily in the area, but a large proportion of whom could be regarded as falling appropriately for action under either a Scheme of Transference to other areas, or initially into Training Schemes with a view to subsequent employment in new districts.The figure of 42,000 men mentioned in paragraph 15 may well prove to be over-estimated, and that, in fact, the real surplus in the area is likely to be larger in all the age groups.67. The estimate given in paragraph 10 represents the best assessments possible, taken at one datal point, by Officers of the Ministry of Labour into the potential &quot; absorbability &quot; capacity of the area. I am afraid, however, it would be unduly optimistic to hope that the establishments in the area would be likely, concurrently, to need additional labour. It may indeed happen that where an increased number of men are employed by a coalmine or steel works, the recovery is off-set by termination of employment of workpeople in other establishments. There will, further, inevitably be a proportion of the men who will find difficulty in re-entering industry, either locally or in a new district, on various grounds, e.g., health, unsuitability, etc., and it is necessary, therefore, to accept the conclusion reached with reserve, and with regard to many factors not readdy determinable on the information available.Analysis of (6) Age Group.
Conclusions(1) That the portion of the scheduled depressed area of South Wales from the Eastern Valley of Monmouthshire to and including Port Talbot on the East is the most depressed section of the South Wales Coalfield.(2) That under present conditions there exists in this area a number of &quot; black &quot; spots as Blaina, Brynmawr, Rhymney, Merthyr, Dowlais, Ebbw Vale and Senghennydd. A revival of industry in adjoining areas, by absorbing, on ordinary industrial conditions, a proportion of the available Labour Supply, may improve the position of these Centres, and (owing to geographical disposition) leave other large districts such as the Rhondda Valley, Maesteg and Pontypridd in a condition industrially serious. In the light of what is said in the section of the Report dealing with &quot; pockets of unemployment &quot; I have, in the main, felt it is difficult to escape from the conclusion that the Eastern area of the coalfield should, for the purpose of this Report, be regarded as one unit.(3) That the labour-absorbing capacity of the area has contracted since 1927, and without extension or development the additional absorbing capacity of existing industrial establishments under favourable trade conditions is not likely to exceed 42,000 men, but it is doubtful if the basic industries under ordinary conditions will recover to this extent.(4) Accepting the position as at 3 above, there will remain in the area, surplus to local requirements, 39,000 men and 5,000 boys.(5) That large numbers of men who have been unemployed for lengthy periods, will require reconditioning before they are able suitably to re-enter industry, particularly in new environments.(6) That the principal avenue for a substantial number of men to approach against a return to industry will be by transference to a new area.(7) That Training Schemes for adults organised by the Ministry of Labour will be required to play a prominent part in assisting men to enter employment in a new area, and that the present policy of the Ministry in establishing Centres in the industrially prosperous areas is well founded.(8) That Instructional or Reconditioning Centres will be an essential part of any extensive scheme of industrial transference.(9) That whilst the problem attached to unemployment amongst women and girls is not serious as compared with men, it may be necessary to intensify the present transfer arrangements.(10) That assuming the local absorption of a substantial number of men and the transference of men and boys of a suitable standard, on a low estimate 19,000 men of mature age will remain in the area, but this number is likely to be increased by the men of low industrial value who are not likely to be suitable for the heavy industries in the area or for transference to other districts.
Recommendations(1) That the depressed areas should have priority in all Labour Transference Schemes and vigorous efforts made to transfer to the more prosperous areas the surplus boys and the men between the ages of IS and 45.(2) That as and when conditions warrant such a course, training facilities should be expanded, and the Ministry should, meanwhile, give consideration to the suitability of extending the length of the course in trades dependent on the individual skill and craftsmanship of the trainee.(3) That as an experiment, a Preparatory Training Centre be established in- Merthyr or Tonypandy.(4) That consideration should be given to the question of intro-ducing more specialised courses in domestic training for women.(5) That the observations made in paragraph 53 designed to suggest improvement in the existing conditions as applied to juveniles, should receive careful consideration.(6) That in view of the substantial number of men who will be outside the transference or training field and are likely to be surplus to local requirements, the creation of new interests and occupations is a phase of activity that deserves encouragement and, as indicated in Section XI, the system of voluntary Occupational Centres is regarded as one which, operated on appropriate lines, may usefully be extended.In many localities the land in the Mining Valleys of South Wales is not very suitable for allotments, but so far as practicable, I advocate their cultivation as a remedial measure, and the movement as one to be encouraged.
SECTION IIICOAL MINING industry. In the Eastern Section of the Scheduled Depressed Area of South Wales (i.e., the portion of the coalfield which embraces the field of the investigation as explained in Section II of the Report) the unemployment position in May, 1934, was as under : (1) (2) r    (3) (4)Insured Wholly Temporary PercentageWorkers.

Stoppage, i Unemployed.153,733 50,437           12,410 40-8The figures in columns (1), (2) and (4) are, however, vitiated by the transfer of applicants formerly engaged in coal mining to classifications reflecting inter alia occupations followed since their employment in the industry, e.g., men who have been employed on Road Relief Schemes.2. In this area coal has been the mainstay of the population, and the depression in the coal trade the chief cause of the very large percentage in unemployment figures : Monmouthshire and Glamorganshire had the monopoly of large Welsh Steam Coal which, until the last few years, provided these two Counties with a prosperous and lucrative industry. Owing to modernised power plants, manufacturers have now changed on to small coal to such an extent that the coal producers in some cases are forced to break up their large steam coal to find a sale for their product. Good small coals are available from practically ever,&apos; coalfield in Britain.3. South Wales also relied largely on exporting its coal, mainly to Italy, France, Spain and South America, and the following figures wih show the contraction that has taken place in these markets.In 1913 coal production was 56,S30,000.In 1933 coal production had fallen to 35,891,000.Reduction in 1933 as compared with 1913 :  13,812,000 Export Market. 7,127,000 Home Market. Reduction in 1933 as compared with 1927 :  6,528,000 Export Market.&apos; 3,827,000 Home Market. You will see by these figures that nearly half the decline has taken place during the last six years.In Italy, where Poland has secured a large share in the coal trade, the Board of Trade is doing its best to help, but there the
development of Hydro-Electrical Power supplies has taken away a share of the Coal Market. In France, restrictions have been placed by the Government on imports of our coal trade. In Spain, the increase of production and use of their own home-produced coal is a serious factor against South Wales. In South America, trade depression and currency have militated against our coal producers. In the Irish Free Stale about half a million tons a year were imported from South Wales, but half of this, for the time being, has gone elsewhere.4. As regards our Home Market, the decline in Welsh Steam Coal has already been alluded to above, but the more serious blow to the trade was the loss of the Admiralty contract consequent upon the change over of naval ships from coal to oil fuel.5. One is bound to face up to the fact that there can be no real prospect of the coal production in South Wales ever being likely to return to anything like its former figure of production. Having formed this conclusion, I consulted the various Associations and individuals to try and see what ideas they could give me before giving my recommendations on this all important question.6. I met Mr. Finlay Gibson and Mr. Iestyn Williams (Secretary and Assistant Secretary to the South Wales Coal Owners&apos; Association) privately before seeing the South Wales Coal Owners&apos; Association. Two days later I arranged a meeting with the South Wales Coal Owners&apos; Association, when the following gentlemen were present: Representing :Mr. Trevor Mort (Chairman)   Ebbw  Vale  Iron,   Steel  and coal Co.Mr. Evan Williams ..       ..   Thos.    Williams    and    Sons(Llangennach) Ltd.Mr. E. L. Hann      . .       ..   Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Co.Sir John Beynon, Bart.     . .   Ebbw Vale  Iron,   Steel  and coal Co.Mr. W.

Oakdale Navigation Collieries,Ltd. (Tredegar Iron, Steel and Coal Co.).Mr. R. Gibb ..       . .       ..   Glenavon Garw Collieries, Ltd.,Treherbert.Mr. W. M. Llewellyn ..   Bwllfa and Cwmaman Collieries,Ltd. (Welsh Associated Collieries).Mr. Finlay Gibson   ..       ..   Secretary.Mr. Iestyn Williams ..   Assistant Secretary.
234Mr Evan Williams spoke on behalf of the Coal Owners and also answered the questions I put to the Association.(1) He stressed the loss of their Export Markets.(2) Loss of the Admiralty contract (which they realised theycould not recover). (3) Coal for Steam Vehicles, and the imposition of the additional duties in 1933 had driven 500 steam vehicles off the road. (4) Gas Road Vehicles. I raised this question with the Coal Owners, and was told that experiments had been satis-factorily carried out in Birmingham ; they appreciated the fact that this would not be suitable for ordinary private motor cars, but gas could be used by heavy passenger vehicles. In answer to my question I was told that they had not officially approached the London Passenger Transport Board on this subject, and whilst the gas coal produced in South Wales was admittedly not the best for the production of gas, the increased demand for this type of coal would react favourably on the South Wales Coalfield. It was stated that buses could run on gas at a cost equivalentto petrol at 5^. per gallon. (5) Oil from Coal. In answer  to my question, Mr. Evan Williams stated that (a) Low Temperature Carbonisation Process had no attraction for the South Wales Coal Owners because the residual smokeless fuel characteristic of this process, would compete with natural coal;  and regarding(b) Hydrogenation, this would be the best system, but Mr. Williams thought that the Coal Owners could not establish a plant on their own, but would be prepared to collaborate with the LCI.(6) Draining South Wales Coalfields. I asked Mr. Evan, Williams about the scheme prepared by Captain Carey, Divisional Inspector of Mines. He told me a Committee had been appointed to go into this scheme, and would report. In answer to a further question, he stated that he thought they would report in favour of it. (7) Inland Quota. Mr. Williams stated, in regard to the recent Bill which had been withdrawn, that when the matter was first considered they could not get the necessary majority. When threatened with an Act, the Coal Owners got together again and agreed to adopt the proposal for separation of Inland and Export Coal Quotas. As to the effect of this, he stated that whilst it might be embarrassing to individual Coal Owners, he did not think
it would cripple South Wales. (Having seen Sir Samuel Instone, I know that certain individual Coal Owners did not agree with this point of view.) (8) Local Authority Rates. Mr. Williams said the Rating of Collieries was much higher than the Rating of other industries.(9) Tinplate Industry. Mr Williams stated that when the value of the dollar fell the competitive power of U.S.A. had improved and exports had increased five-fold. In the Autumn of 1933, the Tinplate Works were working to a capacity of 66 per cent, to 70 per cent., but this had dropped to 50 per cent, to 52 per cent, and all this had an effect on the coal trade.(10) Mechanisation. In answer to a question, Mr Williams said that the collieries in South Wales were not so sus-ceptible to the introduction of mechanical processes as other areas. (I do not altogether agree with this view, which is far too sweeping.)7. I met Mr. James Griffiths, Chairman of the Welsh Miners&apos; Federation, Alderman Arthur Jenkins, and Mr. Oliver Harris, Secretary, two days later.Oil from Coal. Their views as regards oil from coal were along the same lines as the Coal Owners, also their views against free export of coal.Drainage of South Wales Coalfields they considered absolutely essential.They discussed New Industries, Training Centres, Afforestation, Welfare Work of the Society of Friends, land for Small Holdings, but as these points are dealt with under separate headings of my Report, I will not discuss them here.S. I also saw Captain Carey, Divisional Inspector of Mines, and discussed his scheme (Drainage of Coalfields) with him, besides other questions pertaining to the coal trade.9. At my meetings with the Glamorgan and Monmouthshire County Councils, and at all the Urban District Councils, they invariably raised the question of the Coal Industry, and it became obvious that the coal trade is the principal preoccupation of ever,--body in South Wales. I went and saw Sir Harry McGowan in London on the question of Hydrogenation, and he gave me all the information possible. The new plant of the LCI. will not be producing for another nine months, so it will be impossible to prove out this new process till then.10. I also had an interview with Professor Knox, late Principal of School of Mines, Treforest, who has prepared a scheme for the setting up of ten Low Temperature Carbonisation Plants and one Hydrogenation Plant.
235(1) A substantial increase in the present output of the. South Wales Coalfields cannot be expected.(2) The proposed new Dowlais Cardiff Works will use about 400,000 tons of coal a year, which at the rate of 250 tons output per man per year would give employment to 1,600 miners.(3) The Ebbw Vale Steel Works and the old Dowlais (Merthyr) and the Blaenavon Steel Works being closed add largely to the depression in the Coalfields.(4) The only prospects of increasing coal production is by finding new uses for coal along scientific lines.(5) The South Wales Coal Owners&apos; mentality appears to be looking more for the old uses of coal than for the newer scientific methods of coal treatment, i.e., they stressed the advantage of steam vehicles, and the loss of the Admiralty contract more than oil from coal processes and gas road vehicles.(6) I found the Coal Owners and the Miners&apos; Representatives working at quite opposite angles (this may be influenced by political considerations, but since 1926 there has been no conflict between them sufficient to&apos;cause strikes or lock-outs).(7) The organisation of the coal mines in five or six large groups, as it is in South Wales, is probably the most economical way of working the mines, but the Coal Owners might be much more in touch with their own workers in an effort to get more co-operation in matters of costs and sales.(8) The question of Royalties was brought up at nearly every meeting I had, but this point of view is already well known to H.M. Government.(9) The Miners&apos; Representatives are very suspicious of the methods of assessing their wages, owing to the number of subsidiary selling corhpanies the coal companies have formed. The proceeds from coking and bye-product plants do not come into the revenue for the fixation of wages.j Recommendations(1) THat South Wales be promised that if the LCI. Hydro-hydrogenation Plant be proved an economic success, this area will be considered next. I consider that this should be done by the LCI. rather than by the coal companies.(2) That the future of gas road vehicles should be explored as closely ^as possible.(3) That to secure an increase in the coal export trade of South Wales the Board of Trade should endeavour to negotiate a Trade Agreement with Italy on the same lines as that concluded with the Scandinavian Countries, and also use all possible pressure on other Countries which, in the past, were large importers of Welsh coal.(14560 C) d
South Wales has been penalised indirectly by the Trade Agree-ments entered into with the Scandinavian Countries, which operate in favour of the North East Coast and which agreements may have driven Italy (which in the past imported large quantities of Welsh coal) to conclude Trade Agreements (involving the purchase of coal) with Poland.(4) That every care should be taken when a mine is closed down to try and arrange for a certain portion of the miners employed to be transferred to an adjoining mine, or even to mines in other parts of the South Wales Coalfield, so as to even out the hardships in-curred. (This is already being done up to a certain point, and is rendered much easier by the new roads that have been constructed and the use of motor buses.)(5) That the South Wales Coalfields Drainage Scheme should be proceeded with. This should provide work for approximately 2,000 men for about four years. As regards the question of financing the scheme, I am not in agreement with the views which I under-stand would be put forward by the South Wales Coal Owners. In my opinion, if H.M. Government considered it was necessary for the future efficient working of the mines that this scheme should be adopted, this could only be done by loan facilities.(6) The question of Royalties. I make no recommendation, though I know the point has been raised by the Durham Investigator and the facts are already well known to H.M. Government. There is no doubt that in this area of South Wales some Royalties are very high, and a serious factor for a depressed industry to bear by way of increased cost of production.(7) I consider, owing to the present attitude of the South Wales Coal Owners and the Miners&apos; Representatives in this area, that the Government should appoint a man like Mr. Frank Hodges as Observer or Liaison Officer, who would be a great help in this district. I find he is still held in esteem by the best men in the Miners&apos; Federation, as well as the Coal Owners, and would carry much more weight than a permanent official in these Councils. As we may-visualise the adoption of scientific methods in the use of coal, e.g., oil from coal, a man such as I am recommending would be of great assistance in the planning or-setting out of these ideas, while he might also be able to give the necessary impetus to the problems of marketing coal along progressive lines, and also it would show South Wales that the Government are still taking a personal interest in the area, which counts a great deal in the minds of the people of South Wales.A map is enclosed showing the groupings of the larger Coal Companies, and areas where pits have been dismantled.
236SECTION IV &apos;IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY Eastern Section of Depressed Area1. I would like to say that I have received all the help possible from Messrs. Guest, Keen, Nettlefolds and Baldwins in my investi-gations, especially from Mr. Hollings and other members of the Board, who asked me to go and see them.2. The Iron and Steel Industry in this area has suffered severely through the closing down of Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds&apos; Works at Dowlais and the Ebbw Vale Steel Works.Guest, Keen have now arranged to start the erection of their new Works at Cardiff, called Cardiff-Dowlais Steel Works. They wdl first have to absorb their old Cardiff men (approximately twelve hundred) who are out of work, and they have given an undertaking that after they have been taken on they will give the first refusal for re-employment to their old Dowlais men, and eventually they may be able to absorb about five hundred of these men.3. In regard to the Steel Plant at Dowlais, which is not now operating, I have seen the correspondence between Sir John Beale, Chairman of Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds, and the Merthyr Cor-poration, and he states definitely that he cannot see his way to re-open these Works, giving his reasons. Merthyr and Dowlais have, therefore, no real cause of complaint beyond the fact that it leaves a great number of men unemployed.4. The question of the Ebbw Vale Steel Works is a much bigger one, and there is greater cause of complaint among the workers as they have not been told what is going to happen. They state that they have sent deputations to Sir John Beynon, who first told them that he could do nothing without Tariffs ; then when Tariffs were put on they were told the Tariff was not high enough, and, when the Tariff was raised they say they were told that the Works could not be re-opened unless there was a guarantee that Tariffs would remain on. They are now naturally expecting that something wdl be done.I have seen Sir John Beynon, who told me that he was waiting on Barclays Bank, who had sent a technical engineer (Mr. Roberts) to make a report for them.5. I want the men to be told definitely (as Guest, Keen have done with reference to Dowlais) whether the Works were to be re-opened or not. After a consultation with Sir Horace Wilson I went to Barclays Bank and had an interview with Mr. Goodenough and Mr. Fisher. They told me that although they had called for a report on the Steel Works it was Sir John Beynon who should bring(14560 C) d2
forward a scheme and they would consider it. I told them that what I was concerned with was the question of the men being told something definite as to whether they were going to re-open or shut. After going to Barclays Bank I wrote to Sir John Beynon, and a copy of my letter is enclosed. I also read the letter to Mr. Fisher over the telephone. I stress the point of Ebbw Vale, as it plays such an important part in this area and I have had to see four or five deputations concerning these Works.6. The men were told by Sir Frederick Mills that he had put in the most up-to-date plant. They know it is in the hands of Barclays Bank, and when I tell them that the Iron and Steel Trade is being reorganised from the point of view of efficiency, they either quote Sir Frederick Mills, or else point out that the Banks came to the rescue of the Cotton Trade and in most cases gave help to those firms that were doing worst. These are the arguments put up to me and, as I have already said, it is essential they should be told what is going to happen to them.7. As regards Blaenavon Company Limited&apos;s Steel Works, I had an interview with Mr. John H. Lones, Managing Director, and here is a summary of what he told me : Mr. Lones explained that his concern was an Iron and Coal Company. The five Collieries controlled by the Com-pany have been working as regularly as any others in South Wales, but the Iron Works, with the exception of a Mill turning out tyres, had been closed down for six or seven years.Some two or three months ago the Company contemplated the re-opening of the Iron Works and about 300 men had been employed putting the place in order.  22,000 had been spent on the reorganisation, of which  15,000 had been ad-advanced by the National Provincial Bank.The Company was now short of money and  50,000 to  60,000 was required during the next six to nine months to complete the reorganisation which would enable the Iron Works to get going. The National Provincial Bank, however, refused to advance any more money. I asked him why he had estimated for  22,000 and later found he required  50,000. He admitted he had not allowed for working capital.Mr. Lones suggested that the Government might guarantee a loan, but I pointed out that to my knowledge the Government had never done this before in the same circumstances. Mr. Lones said that if the money was forth-coming an immediate start could be made and when the Works were in full operation 500-600 men would be employed.

I had an interview with Mr. Stuart Martin, Managing Director of this Company, and the following summary of the discussion explains the position : (a) About 230 men now employed at the mine working on a single-shift basis. A double shift could be worked and 550-600 men employed if sufficient orders were received. (6) The working of the mine depends entirely on the orders received from Guest, Keen and Baldwins, Ltd., except for a smaller order of 500 tons per week which is now expected from the Blaenavon Iron and Steel Company. At present Guest, Keen and Baldwins are taking 3,000 tons per week between the Cardiff and Port Talbot Works.
If another furnace is opened at Cardiff in November, as anticipated, they would take a total 4,000 tons from Llanharry. The relationship with Guest, Keen and Baldwins is a very friendly one.(c) When Guest, Keen and Baldwins stopped their orders forsome months a year or two ago, the owners had to close the mine, but were left with the burden of keeping the mines free from water.(d) Mr. Martin stressed that the mine was run on highlyefficient lines but drew attention, however, to the expense which had to be incurred in dewatering the mines. He said that the ore could compete with any ore for price and quality.(e) Mr. Martin said there was about 50 per cent of iron in thehematite, while Corby&apos;s mines at Grantham, Lincolnshire, had about 30 per cent of iron. He estimated Corb3r&apos;s costs at about 14s. per ton delivered. Llanharry ore could be delivered at 12s. to 13s. per ton. The Lincoln-shire ore can be disposed of at the works in the immediate neighbourhood at a much lower figure. The Llanharry ore, he stated, was superior to that mined in Oxfordshire(J) Mr. Martin said some Spanish ore was better in quality and some worse. The Llanharry ore was equal in quality to the average Spanish ore. Mr. Martin said, in confidence, that the Spanish ore from Guest, Keen and Baldwins mines is brought to this country at cost price, the profit being made on the iron and steel produced. The Spanish ore at present freightage rates costs Is. or 2s. less than than that of Llanharry.(g) There are 2-J- to 3 million tons of ore now available formining. Working on the one shift basis it would take 15 years to exhaust the present development. Mr. Martin said that there is a long life before the mines, which are capable of considerable development.(h) Mr. Martin pointed out that the Llanharry mines andGuest, Keen and Baldwins Iron and Steel Works were of great importance one to another. He had been in negotiation with Mr. Hollings of the Cardiff Works and there had been discussion of the Guest, Keen and Baldwins Company taking a substantial interest in the Mines. The Glamorgan Hematite Co. had offered Guest, Keen and Baldwins a half share of the mines, but Mr. Stuart Martin stated that the price offered was much too low and the matter was now lying on the table.
(i) The following table shows the quantity of ore imported into South Wales Ports as compared with output at Llanharry.	1929.	1930.	1931.	1932.	1933.	1934 to 30/4/1934Quantity of ore im-ported into South Wales Ports	1,121,612	808,140	524,764	430,734	647,759	171,687Quantity of Llan-harry ore produced	206,871	146,801	15,969	60,954	103,976	1934 to 8/4/1934 46,92710. I discussed this question with Mr. Hollings of Guest Keen and Baldwins, and his views were not as optimistic as Mr *Stuart Martin s.Conclusions(1) I consider Ebbw Vale and Blaenavon the two black spots in this area.(2) Guest, Keen, Nettlefolds and Baldwins should be able to progress under their new reorganisation schemes.(3) In regard to the Iron Ore Mine at Llanharry, the best thing would be for Guest, Keen and Baldwins to take a participating interest in this mine.recommendation that an expert in the Iron and Steel Trade should be sent down to report on the future prospects of Ebbw Vale and Blaenavon so that the men can be told definitely if these Works can re-open or not. This is provided the present authorities responsible for these Works do not take the initiative themselves.Addendum Blaenavon Company, LimitedSince writing this report I have been informed that the Board of Directors controlling the Blaenavon Company have decided not to re-start the blast furnaces, as Baldwins have agreed to purchase their coke for the next eighteen months on condition that the Company do not operate their blast furnaces. I may add that the Blaenavon Company have not yet informed their workers of the position.
PRIVATE.25th May, 1934.My Dear Sir John,I tried to get hold of you yesterday and also this morning, as I wanted to have a word with you again on the question of the Ebbw Vale Steel Works.I went to Barclays Bank yesterday and had a talk with Mr. Goodenough and Mr. Fisher. Their position appears to be as follows : they can do nothing on this question, but they could consider any scheme that is put up to them by you and your Directors.Why I am anxious about this situation is that I have to report on the prospects of employment for the numbers of men in this Area, and as I find that in Ebbw Vale itself the men themselves have the idea that there is a very good prospect of these Works being re-opened, I think the situation should be cleared up. I think they ought to be told definitely, one way or the other, whether these Works will be re-opened or not.I shall be down in South Wales on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and at Pembroke Docks on Thursday. You can get hold of me at the Ministry of Labour Divisional Office, Dominions House, Cardiff.Yours sincerely,(Signed) WYNDHAM PORTAL.Sir John Beynon, Bart., C.B.E.,9, Oakwood Court, W.14.Copy of Letter addressed to Sir John Beynon, Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron and Coal Company, Limited[Section IV Paragraph 5.)
SECTION VNEW INDUSTRIES AND GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED WORKS1. I have given very serious consideration to the question of the chances of attracting new industries into this area, and have heard the views of many public bodies and individual men as to the prospects of success in this direction.I have had long discussions with the Industrial Development Council of South Wales and Monmouthshire, who have taken the initiative in furthering efforts to attract new industries. A list is appended (Appendix I) of enquiries for sites, agencies, etc., they have received. The Industrial Development Council of South Wales and Monmouthshire is an energetic body, but without any real power, as no big industrialists take an active part on their Councd.2. The Borough of Merthyr, and every Urban District Council throughout this area, consider that their localities are suitable for the establishment of new industries, and go so far as to say that the Government should be in a position to compel people starting new industries to do so in their districts, a point of view which I have told them is, in my opinion, quite impossible, as all that a Govern-ment could do, if asked, is to bring particular localities to the notice of firms making enquiries.3. If the coast board which runs from Swansea-Cardiff to Newport is left out of account, I consider it unlikely that any new industry could be persuaded to start in this area, under present circumstances. Along the coast line with harbours close at hand (especially in the Cardiff area) there might be prospects for new industries, as the modern trend of industrial progress is moving either towards the sea or towards potential markets. It is, however, well to recollect that the water supply, which is abundant in the Welsh Valleys, is a great asset to some industries. People in the area realise, I believe, that there may be a feeling against South Wales owing to &quot; labour &quot; troubles of the past a feeling which one knew of before one came down.4. I found at Merthyr one new industry &quot; a process for treating non-ferrous metals and alloys &quot; which is short of capital, and which may have prospects ; I have had a Chemist down to look into the process with a view to ascertaining whether there is ariy chance of getting the project started on a commercial basis.5. As regards smaller industries which require financial assistance, I also attach a list (Appendix II), supplied by the Industrial Council, and some of these may be worth consideration. Industries such as Brickworks which have been brought to my notice cannot be entertained, as in my opinion there is not much prospect for the
240building trade in this locality. Canning, owing to the proximity of the Tinplate Works, has also been mentioned, but in this trade the produce intended for canning is not grown in appreciable quantities in the locality. The only industry that could be introduced with real prospects of success would be one under Government control, and I have given my views on this in the addendum to this section of the Report. The people in this area hold the idea that the Government of the Country can either start up or locate new industries wherever they choose.Government Controlled industry. I do not know what the future policy of H.M. Government may be, as a result of the probable change in the strategic position which may be brought about by the use of aircraft in times of war. I am aware that at present war planes are bought from private firms, whose establishment may be located in places liable to attack in times of war. The locality of Cardiff (which has a new Aerodrome of about 90 acres with ready made building sites) or Pembroke Dock (for the establishment of private aeroplane factories), would possess great strategic value in times of war, as it would give the time necessary for our aeroplanes to get into action. If this idea (which is only a personal one) is regarded as impracticable, the uses of the sites in this area for other purposes regarded as appropriate by H.M. Government would, if adopted, provide a measure of needed assistance to the area in South Wales I have been asked to explore.Conclusions(1) There is practically no prospect of establishing new industries in the Welsh Valleys, by normal methods.(2) That the sites in proximity to the coast line from Swansea-Cardiff-Newport are quite suitable for certain new industries.(3) That the high local rates and past labour troubles in South Wales have militated against the prospects of firms starting in this area.Recommendations(1) That H.M. Government place one of their factories under Government control in this area, which would probably be the means of other industries setting up in this locality.(2) That they might suggest to any large producers who contract for the Government that they would place a ten years&apos; firm contract with them, provided they produce in this distressed area.(3) That in a district where more than 50 per cent, of men are out of work, the Government might offer to subsidise the wages of the unemployed men taken on by any firm prepared to set up a factory in the district up to X per cent, for the first two years.
(4) That, if possible, the Board of Trade should make a special point of bringing to the notice of firms the coast-line area of Cardiff, Newport and Swansea.(5) That a financial adviser, i.e., a post war chartered accountant should be appointed to look into the questions of those smaller industries requiring extra capital, and where the report is satisfactory to put them in touch with companies such as Credit for Industries, Ltd., Bute Street, Cardiff, an off-shoot of the United Dominions Trust, Ltd.SECTION VILAND SETTLEMENTS, SMALL HOLDINGS AND ALLOTMENTS1. These questions were discussed at interviews I had with the Glamorganshire County Council, the Monmouthshire County Council, and they were also raised at the meetings of Urban District Councils which I attended. I also saw Mr. Brymer Jones, Secretary of the Welsh Department of Agriculture and Mr. Thomas Griffith (Land Commissioner to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries) and I went fully into the matter with Mr. D. J. Davidson (Director of Agriculture) and Mr. S. Horton (Director of Small-holdings) of Glamorganshire County Council.2. In South Wales and the Area where I am investigating, the position of Small-holdings from the point of view of having them near the men&apos;s houses in this Distressed Area is quite impossible as in most cases the land is not suitable, from any point of view. Though here and there, there are small-holdings up these Welsh Valleys, one cannot really take them into consideration.3. The only opportunities for Small-holdings would be in the Vale of Glamorganshire or Monmouthshire, where the land is very fertile. Glamorganshire has taken up Small-holdings rather extensively. The total area of the Small-holdings Estate is 7,163 acres, which includes 246 acres let to the Forestry Corn-mission. 3,574 acres are freehold, purchased at a price of  129,425. The leasehold area comprises 3,540 acres at an annual rent of  4.02S. The total annual rent roll at the present time is  12,535. There are 233 tenants occupying 26S holdings 145 of these holdings are equipped with house, buildings and land. The Small-holdings represent 5 per cent, of the cultivable land in the County of Glamorganshire. They have had some trouble in obtaining the land for small holdings and in some cases have probably had to pay a great deal too much.
2Total for 500 men ..     335,000(with families = about 2,000).This works out at  670 per man. At 3i per cent., the rent would be about  23 10s. 0^., and with the addition of local rates would be about  30 per man per annum.7. I feel certain that if a scheme of this sort were to be under-taken, it would be essential for these men to have a preliminary training of one year at a training centre of some description, run on similar lines to the one that Mr. Davidson has in Glamorgan ; they would thus have the chance of proving themselves suitable for work on the land.8. There is also the difficulty to be overcome that during that period, and also the first year in their Small-holdings, they would require to draw some form of payment, as it has been proved, not4. Mr. Davidson, Director of Agriculture, for the County of Glamorganshire, had charge of 100 acres of land, divided into three holdings, (a) Dairy ; (b) Poultry and (c) Market Gardening. No bailiff was employed, but the holdings were run by the men them-selves, under the technical guidance of officials of the Agricultural Committee. I mention this fact because whatever is done as regards Land Settlements or Small-holdings, it will probably be necessary to give the men some preliminary training.5. The South Wales miner appears to be a most adaptable man, and where it is possible for him to get allotments or gardens, he shows himself to be quite an adept. One must remember that in these Welsh Valleys there are still quite a number of men who, during recent years, came from agricultural districts as far away as Somerset.6. If one contemplates the idea of putting men into Small-holdings on a large scale, so that it would be possible for them to have the advantage of co-operative buying and selling (which I think is essential), one would have to allow (taking the unit to be 1 for each 100 men to be dealt with in a prescribed area)  300 per house,  60 for out-buildings and  50 grant for Stock. That is to say, each man would cost  410, without allowing for the price of land, which would vary in different areas. If you were allowing for 5-acre holdings for market gardening (which would have to be in selected districts), the cost for 500 small holdings would work out approximately as follows : Land at  2 per acre (capitalised) ..  130,000 Housing at  300 per house    ..       ..      150,000Out-buildings at  60   ......       30,000Grant of  50 for Stock ..       ..       25,000
only in agriculture but in other lines of business, that a man must have something to live on during the first two years before he gets really started ; else it is merely putting a premium on his failure.9. If a scheme of Small-holdings and Land Settlements was undertaken, it would be necessary for the men to move from their present homes in the Welsh Valleys. It would therefore not be necessary to have the land either in Glamorganshire or Monmouth-shire. As the average agricultural holding throughout the County of Glamorganshire is only about 60 acres, it would probably be difficult to obtain enough land there to make the venture worth while. It might be found more expedient to try it out in some other County.10. As regards the question of having Small-holdings for the purpose of keeping pigs and poultry, and about 20 acres of land, Or whether it is preferable to train men for market gardening on 5-acre holdings, I would not like to express an opinion, as the Ministry of Agriculture know much more about this than I do. I would suggest, however, that in the miners who are out of work in these Welsh Valleys you have a very good type of man to take up an agricultural life.11. In respect to Allotments, I found that these are provided for as far as possible round the respective villages in the mining areas, but the land in many cases is unsuitable. I have found only one or two cases where they have had difficult)&apos; in obtaining the land. The Society of Friends have organised the question of Allot-ments very well and are providing the men with seeds and equipment at a very small cost.I regard the allotments scheme as being the most suitable for the older people, who are too old to leave their homes in the Welsh Valleys, or for the miners who are at present in work. If one is looking for a long-term policy, then one must see if it is possible to put men into Small-holdings on a large scale.Conclusions(1) I found that in every district there is a great desire for men to have the opportunity of obtaining Small-holdings and of being transferred to a district suitable for this form of agriculture.(2) I should say that both Glamorganshire and Monmouthshire have studied this question very extensively and that Glamorgan-shire have in their Director of Agriculture a first-class man.(3) There are numbers of men out of work as miners, who were originally agricultural labourers and would soon pick up work on the land again.
(4) I found everybody in agreement that it would be better for these men to have some practical training, and to be weeded out if they were found unsuitable, before giving them holdings of their own.Recommendations(1) That the Distressed Areas have prior place in the question of Land Settlement.(2) That if Land Settlement is undertaken, it be done along the lines indicated by the Minister of Agriculture by placing the men on one large estate or tract of land, so as to make it possible for them to start off with co-operative buying and co-operative selling.(3) That these men should have a year&apos;s training in order to see that they are suitable for work on the land.(4) That these men should be given an allowance, or allowed to draw their unemployment pay for the first year that they are in their Small-holdings.(5) That men of the type of County Directors of Agriculture should supervise these Small-holdings for the first two or three years.I have made no recommendation as to the size of the holding, as it depends almost entirely on the quality of the land, its proximity to the markets, and its suitability for such ventures as market gardening.I have made no recommendation as to the ages of the men to be put on the land from this Distressed Area, as I think that some of the older men, who have agricultural knowledge, might be suitable for this life. At the same time, I realise that one wants the younger men to take up these new ideas, which have never been extensively practised in this country.SECTION VIIAFFORESTATION1. I found that every public body put forward Afforestation as one of their suggestions for helping unemployment.Mr. Scott (Divisional Officer of the Forestry Commission) Mr. Ryle (District Officer of the Forestry Commission) came and saw me to discuss this question on more than one occasion.Sites for Afforestation2. One of the arguments brought forward to me was that these Welsh Valleys used to be covered with trees many of which were
cut down during the War period, and the land ought to be replanted. Mr. Scott and Mr. Ryle considered there was suitable land for planting in the &quot; derelict &quot; areas and immediate neighbourhood, but it was of a somewhat scattered disposition. The land available presented the difficulties of smoke fumes and fire danger.Conclusions(1) Afforestation, if required to help to find work for the un-employed in this area, would only absorb relatively a small number of men.(2) Afforestation as planned at the present time by the Forestry-Commission appears to be far the most economical way of tackling the problem.(3) According to information supplied to me by the Officers of the Forestry Commission, a 10,000-acre scheme would be planted at the rate of 1,000 acres a year. Approximately 100 men would be employed during the four months&apos; planting season, and 60 of these men would be kept on for the whole year to prepare for next year&apos;s planting.recommendation as there appears to be a general desire for afforestation in this area, I recommend that H.M. Government ask the Forestry Corn-mission to prepare a scheme for this area, and if, after investigation, they consider it practical, they should give an extra grant through the Foresty Commission.SECTION VIIISHIPPINGSouth Wales PortsI got most of my information on this subject from Mr. Page, who is head of all the docks which are owned by the Great Western Railway Company. Shipping at Newport, Cardiff, Barry, Port Talbot and Swansea is depressed owing to the great falling off of the export of coal from South Wales. The docks are all up to date, and I cannot see any revival of shipping in this area unless and until the South Wales export coal trade recovers. The question of shipping in this area has not been taken fully into my detaUed investigations, as Newport, Swansea and Cardiff, though suffering from the effects of unemployment in the depressed area covered by the inquiry, cannot be regarded as coming immediately within the scope of the survey.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION(a) Local Rates (including Public Assistance)1. The serious burden of local rates was referred to in the inter-views which I had with the County Councils of Monniouth and Glamorgan ; the Urban District Councils Associations of the two Counties, as well as the Urban District Councils separately or in small groups of Abcrdare, Abersychan, Abertillery, Blaenavon, Bridgend, Brynmawr, Caerphilly, Ebbw Vale, Gelligaer, Llanfrechfa Upper, Llantarnam, Macstcg, Mountain Ash, Nantyglo and Blaina, Panteg, Pontypool, Rhondda and Rhymney ; the Count)&apos; Borough Council of Merthyr Tydfd ; the Borough Councils of Neath and Pembroke ; the Rural District Councils of Neath, Penybont and Pontypool; the Industrial Development Council of South Wales and Monmouthshire ; and Associations of employers and workmen. It was impressed upon me that whilst the rates had been getting higher the assessments and the ability of commercial undertakings and of&apos; the people generally to pay the rates had been getting less and it was urged that so long as this condition of affairs prevailed it was hopeless to induce new industries to come into South Wales. In the County Borough of Merthyr Tydiil the rate for the financial year ended the 31st March last was 27s. 6d. in the pound ; in the Urban District Councils of Bedwellty 24s. 2d. ; Abertillery 24s. ; Gelligaer 23s. lid. ; Caerphilly 23s. Id.; Mynyddislwyn 23s.; Rhondda 22s. 9d. ; Brynmawr 21s. 6d. ; and Nantyglo and Blaina 21s. It was represented that in these and other highly rated districts it was not possible, owing to financial stringency, to proceed with necessary schemes of sewerage, drainage, housing and social services generally. Some of the reasons for the high rates were stated to be heavy calls for Public Assistance including the repayment of the &quot; Goschen Loans &quot; which were made previous to 1930 to the Boards of Guardians of Bedwellty, Crickhowell, Merthyr Tydfil and Pontypridd, for payment of Poor Relief; and the high rates of interest amounting in some cases to as much as 6J- per cent. payable by Local Authorities for loans incurred since 1920 on housing and other schemes.2. In regard to Public Assistance I understand that this has been an increasing burden since the industrial dispute of 1921, and particularly since the coal stoppage of 1926. Thousands of men, I am informed, have had no work or have only worked inter-mittently since the latter mentioned year, whilst in the case of youths of 16 to 21 many of these have no experience of employment of any sort. This has not only had the effect of swelling the Public Assistance demands by reason of the fact that large numbers of persons have not acquired, or have ceased to have, claims on theSECTION IX
Unemployment Insurance Fund or Transitional Payments, but il has also meant that applications from sick, infirm and aged persons have greatly increased in numbers owing to the lessened ability of sons and daughters to assist their parents. In the result, in Glamorgan and Monmouth 694 and 610 persons, respectively, per 10,000 of the population were in receipt of Poor Relief in April of this year, only the County of Durham (with 734 per 10,000) being higher than the two Welsh Counties. Merthyr Tydiil had 1,149 per 10,000, being second to Sheffield, amongst the County Boroughs, with 1,152 per 10,000 of the population.3. The indebtedness of the Goschen Loans (just over  2,000,000) remaining on 1st April, 1930, was under the Local Government Act of 1929 made a charge on the respective County Councils (and County Borough of Merthyr Tydlil), repayable to the Minister of Health in 15 years. I am informed that this charge now represents an annual rate of 9%d. in the   in the administrative County of Monmouth, 5d. in Breconshire, 3id. in Glamorgan and 9d. in Merthyr Tydfil. It will not be liquidated for another 11 j&apos;ears and it was urged on me by the Monmouth County Council that if the period of repayment could be extended to 20 37ears this would afford considerable relief to that County. The point was also made, as it has already been made to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Health, that the spreading of the cost of Poor Relief over the areas of the Administrative Counties (and County Boroughs) by the Local Government Act of 1929, whilst it has eased the position in most of the old Union areas, it has not brought the relief that is necessary to the depressed and derelict districts. It was therefore urged by practically all the Authorities that the principle should be extended and the cost of Public Assistance made to cover the whole country, as a national charge.4. It has been pointed out to me, as I understand it has to the Government, that in the current year the Public Assistance charge (including the Goschen Loans repayments referred to above) in Merthyr Tydfil represents a rate of 15s. l\d., in Glamorgan Ss. 5d., and in Monmouth 7s. 9id., whereas in some of the Counties and Boroughs of England it was recently as low as Is., I0d., and even 6d. in the  . In order to bring about some alleviation in this position I understand that a proposal was considered by the County Councils and Municipal Councils Associations last year on the lines of paragraphs 266-272 of the Final Majority Report of the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance. Under this scheme of the Royal Commission I understand that a uniform rate of Ad. in the   over Great Britain was envisaged, the effect of which would have been to bring relief to the more heavily burdened districts. No agreement, however, was reached and the proposal fell through, but the Government made special grants amounting to  500,000 for the year 1933-34 in aid of this expenditure in certain areas
(including Glamorgan, Monmouth and Merthyr Tydfil) that were regarded as depressed, and provision has been made in. the Un-employment Insurance Bill for relief to County Councils and County Borough Councils in respect of Public Assistance to able-bodied unemployed persons. I think it right also to mention here that under the Block Grant system, whilst the average value of the Exchequer contribution is the equivalent of a 4s. 9d. rate over the Country as a whole, in Glamorgan it is the equivalent of 10s. 11^., and&quot; in Monmouth 10s. Ad.5. In connection with the subject of rates and the pressure upon Local Authorities it was urged by the two County Councils that owing to the effect of the National Insurance Act 1932, a large number of persons who formerly received medical and sickness benefits under the Scheme of National Health Insurance will now fall to be dealt with by the Public Assistance Committees and thus considerably add to the cost of Public Assistance.6. It was also further represented to me, particularly by the Rhondda Urban District Council (which district was formerly embraced in the area of the Pontypridd Union and has been very severely hit by the depression in the South Wales Coalfield) that the resultant effect of the financial provisions of the Local Govern-ment Act 1929 has not been entirely favourable to that Authority. Again, certain other Urban Councils Abercarn, Bedwas and Machen, Mynyddislwjm and Risca in Monmouthshire, and Barry, Bridgend, Cowbridge, Llwchwr, Ogmore and Garw, Penarth and Porthcawl in Glamorgan urged that their districts were being seriously prejudiced in regard to the supplementary Exchequer Grants provided for by Section 94 (1) (b) of the Act referred to, with the result that their necessary services were being seriously curtailed. They looked with alarm at the l/15th reduction in the grant which would take place annually from 1934-5 to 1949-50, when the grant will be extinguished.7. As regards the rates of interest on outstanding loans to Local Authorities, I understand that representations were made to the Minister of Health during a visit that he made to South Wales in the Autumn of 1932.(b) Statutory Social services. In the interviews that I have had with Local Authorities no subject has been more greatly emphasised as I have already indicated above than the increasing difficulty which the Authorities have experienced during recent years in administering efficiently the various services which are cast upon them by statute. I am aware that this subject is to some extent political in character and is one upon which people may legitimately differ in their views as to the proper scope and direction of the activities of the Councils,
and that measures which some would regard as progressive and necessary may be held by others to be excessive or even extravagant. In my approach to this matter, therefore, I have found it necessary to limit myself to a consideration of whether there has been any serious failure or curtailment in the provision of what may be regarded as essential local services. It has been impressed upon me, and I think it must be obvious, that where the rate burden is so considerable there must often be occasions when schemes that are good and necessary in themselves have to be deferred or given up altogether owing to the inability of the Local Authorities further to increase their local burdens.9. The Rhondda Urban District Council, amongst other Authorities, presented me with a list of sewerage and other works which I understand, from enquiries that I have made, are quite desirable from the point of view of public health, or public con-venience, but the Council has been unable to proceed with them. Some of the Authorities find it difficult to obtain sanction for their schemes from the Government Departments though I understand that there is now no statutory limitation in regard to the borrowing powers of Local Authorities. In regard to certain services connected with the Maternity and Child Welfare Act and School Clinics, I am informed that these are not carried out in some districts as well as they should be owing to the financial restrictions. The Carnegie Welfare Centre, which was set up in the Rhondda Valley about S or 9 years ago, was not formally opened (by the Duke of Gloucester) until last year, and I understand that it is not yet in full use.Further, in this same locality I have gathered that the training and equipment of midwives, and the provision of medical and nursing staffs are not satisfactory, though I believe that both the Authorities and their staffs do all that they can, within their limitations.10. In Monmouthshire, also, some 9 years ago, the Coldra Mansion (with 7-J- acres of land) was given by Sir John Beynon to the County Council for the purposes of a Maternity Hospital (of 20 to 25 beds) but this has not yet been put into use owing to the Council being unable to find the necessary money (some  6,500) for alterations and equipment, or to contemplate raising the additional sums (about  5,000 per annum) for maintenance. As a further consequence of the financial stringency the non-user of the Coldra Institution means that there is no provision in Mon-mouthshire for the training of midwives, as the Central Midwives Board require that pupil midwives should be trained at a Maternity Training Home with at least 20 beds. The Cardiff Royal Infirmary have not been able to supply the deficiency of Monmouthshire in this respect. I mention these matters because I have been informed, on high medical authority, that this Count)&apos; is one of the black spots in regard to maternal mortality.
211. I understand that these questions are bound up with the new system of block grants and that the allocation of these grants to the respective services for which the Local Authorities are responsible is a matter mainly for the Authorities themselves to determine. I have not conceived it to be part of my duty to inquire how far the discretion of the Authorities has been wisely exercised in respect to these matters, as the various Ministries are no doubt fully informed in regard to them.12. I may mention, in this connection, that I visited one of the School Feeding Centres at Abertillery and was much gratified with the appearance of the large number of children who were having a dinner at the time of my visit. Two meals (dinner and tea) are supplied daily to children whose parents receive Unemploy-ment Insurance, Transitional Payments, or Poor Law relief, and I am informed that the cost per meal works out at about l%d.(c) County Borough of Merthyr Tydfil13. I think it right to call special attention to the condition of the County Borough of Merthyr Tydfil, as the circumstances relating to South Wales generally seem to be gathered together and epitomised in this single administrative area. Formerly-practically for 150 years the iron and steel works of Merthyr, and those of Cyfarthfa and Dowlais, which are embraced in the existing area of the County Borough, were of great importance. The dismantling of the greater part of these works, however, and the more recent stopping of the Dowlais Works the main portions of which have for many years been transferred to the foreshore at Cardiff- -have left Merthyr to be dependent almost entirely for its industries on the collieries of Treharris and the lower parts of the borough, the earlier and more northerly coal seams having been exhausted. In the result, the population of the County Borough has declined in the last decennial period from SO,116 to 71,108, and the local rates, as I have already indicated, have now reached the almost impossible figure of 27s. 6d. in the  , including 15s. Id. for Public Assistance.14. The Town Council have from time to time had interviews with the owners of the Dowlais Works (Messrs. Guest, Keen and Baldwins) on the subject of restarting those works, but it seems probable that the Company are committed first to the re-conditioning and re-starting of their Cardiff-Dowlais Works, and it is difficult to contemplate that they will be able also to set going these older works, 24 miles from the sea-board, nor is it an easy thing to induce new industries to settle in an area so heavily encumbered and so far from the ports, a district moreover which is surrounded b3&apos; other districts whose industrial and social history and development belong to the same epoch and have been very largely of the same character. I have, however, been to some pains to try and give an impetus to a small industrial enterprise already in working order at
Merthyr, connected with the manufacture of various articles from an alloy, the possibilities of which seem to me to offer scope for exploitation.15. I understand that nearly two years ago, following certain complaints with regard to the administration which were made by the local Ratepayers&apos; Association, investigations were undertaken by the several Government Departments concerned, and suggestions conveyed to the Town Council for economies in various specified directions. Some of these suggestions, I am informed, were not well received by the Council, and though possibly there has- been some saving in certain directions, there is no doubt, as it appears to me, that there is a reluctance on the part of the Council to make any very wide departure from the scale of expenditure, and scope of activities which the Council conceive to be appropriate to an authority holding the status of County Borough. In this connection, I gather that two possible lines of procedure have, in recent years, been discussed, in various quarters, as affording, a possible remedy in the position of places like Merthyr, in so far as the local admin-istration is concerned. The first is that Commissioners should be appointed to take charge of the administration, in displacement of the Council, something on the lines of the procedure adopted in recent years in the case of the city of Dublin and other authorities in Ireland, and certain Board of Guardians like Bedwellty (adjoining Merthyr Tydfil), West Ham, and Chester-le-Street, under the former Poor Law Administration. The second suggestion has been that the status of County Borough, which was conferred on it in 1908, should be taken away from the district and a reversion made to a former and less burdensome status, which would involve the merging of certain very considerable items of expenditure in particular that of Public Assistance into that of the administrative County by which it woidd be embraced. I gather that when informal soundings in regard to this latter suggestion were made in influential quarters connected with the Glamorgan County Council, it was not received with enthusiasm. In either case I understand that legis-lation would be required before effect could be given to the suggestion.16. I attach the Memorandum submitted by the County Borough of Merthyr Tydfil which they presented to me before I interviewed them on the second occasion. It is interesting from the point of view of showing their position as they themselves visualise it.Conclusions(1) One realises the difficulty in changing the rate of interest on the loans.(2) The question of rates in this area is a very serious one, and unless dealt with in the very near future may become impossible, as the rateable values are declining.
(3) Most of the suggestions put up were quite unpractical.(4) The Public Assistance Rate is the greatest bone of contention.(5) One realises how public money was spent in a most extra-vagant way until it was checked by the various Ministries concerned.(6) The two County Councils stress the point very strongly of the heavy burdens they took over from the local   Boards of . Guardians.(7) It is difficult to estimate what effect on the financial position in this depressed area the new Unemployment Insurance Bill (Part 11) will have, but it was strongly represented to me, especially by the Monmouthshire County Council, that it will be relatively small.(8) On a careful consideration of all the circumstances connected with Merthyr Tydfil, I have come to the conclusion that the status of County Borough has by now become too onerous for the in-habitants of the district to bear and that this is likely, in the future, to be still more pronounced.Recommendations(1) It will be well to wait until the effect of the new Unemployment Insurance Act (Part 11) on this area is ascertained as regards the Public Assistance Rate. If this makes no substantial reduction the position should be reviewed. (I think in these depressed areas they have a real grievance, as it is not through their fault that the coal industry has become so depressed.)(2) If it is possible the liquidation of the Goschen Loans might be extended to 20 years. (Eleven annual instalments of the original 15 remain to be paid.)(3) I would recommend to H.M. Government that it might be considered whether the time has not now come for the promotion of legislation, or for the taking of such other measures as may be necessary to deal with local administrative units such as Merthyr Tydfil in which the method of government seems to be no longer appropriate to local conditions.
SECTION XPUBLIC WORKS1. I consider expenditure on Public Works, with the object of giving employment, as short term policy, and I would like to say at the outset that, except in special cases, I am against it. All Local Authorities whom I have seen, and others, have presented to me schemes which would cost in the aggregate about two and a half million pounds. Most of these schemes have already been submitted to the Ministry of Health or Ministry of Transport and have been rightly held up by the Ministries concerned.2. At all the meetings I have attended, I have spent hours listening to particulars of various schemes which were put before me with the idea of me persuading H.M. Government not only to allow them to go on but to sanction grants which would cover the whole of the expenditure. Whilst it may appear to be a somewhat hard point of view, having regard to the man)- men in this area who have been out of work for a long time, it is necessary to ask whether it does do any real good in the end to provide work locally for three, six, or nine months and then close down without any further opportunity of employment. It may merely tend to make the men more unsettled. The problem must also be examined from the point of view of what Public Works are really necessary.3. The Roads in this area are, on the whole, very good and many new roads have been constructed and others improved in recent years. One proposed road (Senghenydd to Nelson), to which my attention was directed, would undoubtedly assist Colliers living in Senghenydd, which is now more or less a dormitory village, to get to their work at Nelson much more easily and I schedule this road as a possibility.The Ministry of Transport have all these schemes before them and I would rather leave it to them to say if they are necessary.4. The question of the Drainage of the Rivers and the setting up of Catchment Boards, which comes under the Ministry of Agriculture, I schedule in my proposals, as such schemes might be regarded as of value in effecting a real improvement on the condition of the rivers and adjoining land. I understand that there are admin-istrative difficulties as it will be seen from Appendix III that more than one Local Authority is concerned and it may be necessary for the Ministry of Agriculture to do something to bring these Authorities together.5. In regard to Housing, I know the Ministry of Health has called for all the proposals dealing with slum clearance and they will decide this question.   I consider it would merely be a waste
247of public money to embark on ordinary Housing Schemes in these Welsh Valleys as you have (1) an ever declining population ; (2) houses which, in my opinion, taken as a whole, compare favour-ably with those in similar districts in the North of England. I therefore suggest that any such schemes that may be submitted (not being slum clearance schemes) will require to be very closely examined.6. I should like, however, to sound a note of warning about certain Seiverage Schemes which are held up in this area. This is a question of the Health of the people, and it may not be wise to hold them up indefinitely. This matter was discussed with the Medical Officers of Health at many of the Local Authorities&apos; meetings which I attended. In particular, there is one scheme (of the Rhondda Urban District Council) which I schedule for immediate consideration as I consider it necessary, and I under-stand that a local inquiry by the Ministry of Health has been ordered in regard to this. In the other cases, however, I prefer to leave the matter in the hands of the Ministry of Health who have all the expert knowledge on these questions.Schemes Scheduled for Consideration(1) Road SchemesNew road Senghenydd to Nelson.

SECTION XIVOLUNTARY SOCDAL service. I had interviews with Mr. William Noble, and Mr. Peter Scott and saw the work they were doing at Trealaw where they are weaving, and at Brynmawr where they are making furniture in one section and boots in another. I visited one of the Unemployed Clubs in the Rhondda Valley, with which I was enormously impressed, the men contributing twopence a week making furniture and selling it to one another.2. There is no doubt that men were averse in these Unemployed Centres to associating themselves with a Club which was subsidised by Government monies, but opposition based on these grounds is gradually dying down. Some local Authorities held the view that the grant which had been made by the Government to the National Council of Social Service should be administered through local Authorities.3. I had a long discussion with Sir Percy Watkins, Secretary to the Welsh Department of the National Council for Social Service, with whose views and ideas I am in entire agreement, and we are both of the opinion that the Organisers and the members of these Clubs would be strongly opposed to any Government control or interference in the running of voluntary schemes.4. The Government are making a yearly grant to the National Council of Social Service. In the first year the amount was  15,000, but I am informed it has risen to  50,000 (on condition that the National Council found the same amount from voluntary sources) and Sir Percy was of opinion that Wales was getting its proper share in the allocation of this money.(1) That slum clearances approved by the Minister of Health in this area should proceed.(2) That River Drainage and the setting up of Catchment Boards should be encouraged.(3) That the Ministry of Health should, if possible, allow Local Authorities to proceed with any Sewerage Schemes which are absolutely necessary from the health point of view.(4) That it might be possible to provide labour for certain Public Works on (1) the same basis as the Rheola Local Instructional Centre,&apos; i.e., men continue to receive Unemployment pay, plus 2s. a week, with dinner provided ; or (2) on the basis of the Agricultural rate in the Count)&apos; concerned.
5. Apart from the Miners&apos; Welfare Fund industrialists are playing little part in welfare work in the area. The National Council, in organising welfare work, did not, therefore, look to industrialists for much support, but relied on Local Authorities and the Govern-ment for assistance. Owing to the many years of depression in South Wales great difficulty was experienced in collecting money locally and South Wales had to look to persons and bodies outside the area for assistance.6. Money has been made available from various sources, but mainly by the Society of Friends, the Carnegie Trust, and the Pilgrims Trust, but Sir Percy is doubtful if at any rate the two jatter bodies would be prepared to continue these grants indefinitely.7. On the question of organisation, Sir Percy and I agreed that the best way of organising Voluntary Social Service in South Wales was on the lines of the Maesyrhaf Settlement at Trealaw (Mr. and Mrs. Noble), i.e., the appointment of a Warden who would encourage and develop social service in the area. At the moment there are six such Settlements in South Wales, as follows : Settlement.Trealaw (Tony-pandy). BrynmawrName of Warden. Mr. William NobleMr. Peter ScottOrganised and Financed by Society of Friends...   Society of Friends and Commercial     Under-taking   run   in   con-junction with Centre. Bargoed        ..

Local   Committee   and Cardiff people.It was very important that the right type of man (and wife) was selected for this work. The Wardens now in post were, in the main, carrying out their duties satisfactorily.8. In establishing welfare work in an area a Local Committee of interested persons is formed and when the Club is set up the members elect their own officials and, generally speaking, the right type of person is in control. As regards the Wardens, they did not take an official part in the running of a Club, but assisted the Organisers with advice and guidance. .Senghenydd ..   Mrs. Wright
9. Sir Percy said he would like to see a Settlement and Warden in each Valley in South Wales. This might mean four or five additional Settlements. In regard to finance he pointed out that whilst the National Council of Social Service were in a position to make grants for equipment, etc., for these Settlements and their attached Occupational Clubs, the main sources of income were derived from Voluntary Organisations and there was no guarantee that these Organisations would go on meeting this expenditure.10. At the present time there are about 150 Clubs in South Wales, but this only touched the fringe of the problem, and as a rough, estimate Sir Percy thought that only about 12 per cent of the total persons unemployed were attached to Clubs. There was much room for development, but money was required, and he said that if he could get a block grant of  25,000, it would enable the South Wales Council of Social Service, which had been formed recently, to undertake really effective social work. If the Government were prepared to make this further contribution it was assumed that it would be made in the same way as the other grants to the National Council, but it was felt that it should be done as quietly as possible in view of the attitude of some people to State-aided social work.Sir Percy said that one thing which acted against increasing the number of Centres was the difficulty of securing accommodation and/or the funds to pay for premises.11. In regard to the South Wales Council for Social Service Sir Percy told me that two Area Officers (man and woman) had now been appointed and their duty would be to visit Centres and Clubs to advise the Organisers, but it was obvious that they could not establish the same close contact with the Clubs as a Warden could.12. In addition to the Organisations mentioned by Sir Percy Watkins, the following are some of the more important bodies playing an active part in welfare work in the areas mentioned : Place. Organisation. Scheme.Mountain Ash     British Legion     ..   Occupational  Centre  andTredegar      ..   British Legion     ..   Occupational Centre. BootHall.

The men attend for the full day and the period of attendance is unlimited, but the Salvation Army endeavour to find employment for them outside of South Wales. About 40 men are in attendance at each Centre, and all the money for financing the Scheme is found by the Salvation Army.Recreation Grounds13. I asked Sir Percy for his views on increasing the facilities for recreation. Sir Percy said that the Miners&apos; Welfare Fund had done a lot in this direction but, at the moment, the National Council of Social Service do not&apos;play a large part.The National Playing Fields Association were making grants in suitable cases and, generally speaking, Sir Percy was of opinion that recreation grounds schemes should not be subsidised by the Government.Reference was made to the fact that the money available from the Miners&apos; Welfare Fund for this purpose would now be very much restricted for reason that, under a recent Act, the levy had been cut down from Id. to \d. per ton of coal.Sir Percy suggested that if the levy had been left at Id. the Welfare Fund would have been in the position to provide adequate facilities in the majority of districtsAdult Education14. Sir Percy said he was very keen on developing adult education and said the National Council were affording financial assistance to existing organisations such as the Workers&apos; Educational Association, Welsh National Council of Music, and the Drama Society!The W.E.A., which had been working in Wales for over 20 years, was recognised under the Board of Education Regulations for (14560 C) g2ture making, boot repair-ing, and instruction in agriculture.
purposes of a grant of about 50 per cent. When the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund came to an end, and before the National Council took up social work in South Wales, grants were made to these organisations from the Carnegie Trust.The South Wales Council of Social Service had set up a Committee to deal with this matter, and if an additional block grant could be made available, additional grants for the furthering of adult education would be made to the organisations mentioned.In the same way the Council hoped to extend facilities for Physical Training and Summer Camps.15. On the general question of education, I was handed a pamphlet by Sir Percy which had been prepared by the Welsh Department of the Board of Education at the time Sir Percy was Permanent Secretary of that Department. In the first place the report points out the inadequacy of the existing facilities for Technical education in the South Wales Coalfield, and suggests the setting up of a Regional Council, but so far nothing has been done. Sir Percy said that the South Wales Education Authorities were keen on Secondary education but, in his view, had neglected the Technical side.16. The other portion of the report suggests the development of adult education and the establishment of a Regional Council, but here again nothing has been done. Sir Percy added that this question would be met largely by a Special Committee set up by the South Wales Council for Social Service.Libraries17. In answer to a question I asked, it was stated that in the counties concerned the Carnegie Trust has made a grant for a County Library system operated through the Schools.There were also Libraries in the Miners&apos; Institutes, and some time ago the Carnegie Trust voted  50 to each Library (total  1,000) to replenish the books. Sir Percy said that the National Council would be prepared to help in this way if money was forth-coming, and it might also be in a position to provide miniature libraries in Occupational Centres.Conclusions(1) That the administration of Voluntary Social Service lately initiated by Sir Percy Watkins, Secretary of the Welsh Section of the National Council for Social Service, is on the right lines.(2) That in this area the outside organisations enumerated above are doing wonderful work and this is being co-ordinated so far as possible by Sir Percy Watkins.
SECTION XIIPEMBROKE DOCKI was requested to make a special visit to this small isolated area because of the special character of the serious unemployment experienced in the area since the closing of H.M. Dockyard. The following summary of my interview with the Pembroke Borough Councd gives the case as they put it to me at the meeting held on the 31st May.(i) The Development of the Dockyard. The Borough of Pembroke consists of the town of Pembroke, which is an agricultural centre, and the town of Pembroke Dock. Pembroke Dock came into being with the transfer of H.M. Dockyard from Milford Haven in 1814. Pembroke Dock during the nineteenth century grew steadily until in 1925 the Borough was one of the most flourishing communities in the country.(3) That the Unemployed Clubs are far the biggest and most practical side of the Voluntary Social Service in this district.   It might be helpful to try and suggest that the work of co-ordination should lead to some sort of responsibility being lodged for the work, in a central body, e.g., the National Council of Social Service.(4) The Wardens in the various Settlements or Welsh Valleys are at present placed there by different organisations.(5) The man with the right personality to act as Warden is of the greatest importance.Recommendations(1) That a Settlement and Warden be established in each Valley in South Wales. This might mean four or five additional Settlements.(2) That the formation of these Unemployed Clubs alluded to above should be encouraged by every effort possible, so that their scope for development in other directions should proceed.(3) That encouragement and help should be given to the Workers&apos; Education Association, Welsh National Council of Music, and the Drama Movement.(4) That a block grant of  25,000 should be given to the South Wales Council of Social Service for the distressed area, and leave it to them to administer along the lines they consider it could best be spent. (I should leave it to them as I consider they are so well in touch with the situation.)
Under pressure from the Admiralty, the town obtained a water supply, not only adequate for its own supply, but more than sufficient to meet very considerable expansion of the Dockyard, and also installed a sewerage system which was the more costly by reason of having to fall in with Government requirements. The Admiralty spent no money outside the Dockyard beyond erecting a Market which they subsequently sold to the Council, and their workmen erected practically every house in the town, nearly all on a leasehold term.(ii) The Closing of the Dockyard. In 1926 the Government closed the Dockyard they had originated and took away from the Borough its sole industry. The Admiralty transferred 400 established men with their families and left 2,000 workmen unemployed, most of whom had very little chance of getting work at all. Established men over 50 years of age were offered and accepted pensions. The population of the Borough was 15,472 in 1921 and declined to 12,008 in 1931. There are now 1,246 unemployed men registered and the Council estimated that about 300 were not registered. Apart from local shops and house repairing the only source of employment now is Ward&apos;s ship breaking Yard, which employs about 40 men on an average.The reasons given by the Admiralty for the closing of the Dock-yard were that of economy and it was stated that the Admiralty had more Dockyards than were necessary. The efficiency of the Docks had never been questioned and it was understood to be more suitable in many respects than Chatham or Sheerness.The Admiralty had admitted its moral obligation towards Pembroke and had agreed to do all in their pow-er to mitigate the hardships which the closure of the Dockyard entailed.H.M. Government, by way of a concession, had agreed that the rateable value of the Crown property should remain unaltered and this meant that the rateable value of the Borough had remained stationary. (The rate poundage is 14s. 2d. in the pound.) One squadron of the Royal Air Force had been stationed at Pembroke, but this gave practically no employment for civilians. Apart from these measures no special assistance had been given to the Borough.(iii) Sugar Beet Industry. The Council had made persistent efforts to encourage industries to come to the district, but had had no success. There w^as, however, now considerable hope that a Surgar Beet factory might be established in the Borough.Pembrokeshire now produced sugar beet and sent approximately 40,000 tons per annum (4,000 acreage) by rail to a Shropshire factory at a freightage cost of 11s. Qd. per ton. In order to establish a factory it was stated that an acreage of 10,000 was required to be planted and as a result of a campaign financed by the Council promises had been secured of the necessary acreage
in the County area on the borders of neighbouring Counties. It was stated that the Pembrokeshire beet was the best in the country and had won very many prizes. The average yield of beet of the country was 10 tons per acre, but Pembroke&apos;s yield averages 14-7 tons per acre. There was anthracite coal on the spot and also limestone of the quality required. The factory would, it was estimated, consume 60,000 tons of coal and 10,000 tons of limestone.Mr. Beeton of the Lincolnshire Sugar Company had found a very suitable site in Pembroke for a sugar beet factory. Mr. Beeton had said that he would construct a factory if the continuance of the present subsidy was assured. Lord Barnaby and Mr. McAlpine were willing to support the establishment of a factory on these conditions. Sir Walter Elliott and Lord Weir had agreed that Pembroke was suitable for such a factory and the National Farmers&apos; Union were also in favour of the project. The subsidy had now dropped to 6s. 8(1. and this would expire in October, 1935.It was claimed that a factory based on 10,000 acres would deal with approximately 100,000 tons of crop and would give employ-ment to about 600 men in the factory and about 800-1,000 on the land for the duration of the season of four months. The number of men required during the off season would be considerably less.(iv) Appeal for assistance from H.M. Government. The Council, notwithstanding the energy they have shown in endeavouring to explore all avenues with a view to attracting private industries, have all along felt, and after eight years of continuous efforts are confirmed in the view, that the one and only remedy to prevent Pembroke Dock becoming derelict is that the Government should recognise its responsibdity for the maintenance of a town built for and existing solely for Government service.The Councd respectfully suggested that Pembroke Dock might be considered as a suitable site for a Naval yard, for a Naval Stores Depot, for an aeroplane and airship factory and for a Government Arsenal.Conclusions(1) The present buddings at Pembroke Dock are only suitable for the purpose for which they are being used now, i.e., the Royal Air Force.(2) The Admiralty know far better than I do if the harbour and docks are suitable for their purposes.Recommendations(1) A sugar beet factory would go a long way to alleviate unemploy-ment in this area. I am doubtful whether the Councd have not over-estimated the labour absorbing capacity of a factory of the size suggested by them, but the Ministry of Agriculture wfil no doubt be able to advise on this point.

There is no factory in Wales, at present, and the County of Pembroke is most suitable for the growing of sugar beet. This is necessarily a question dependent on the Governments future policy with regard to sugar beet.(2) A Government factory might be established in the adjoining area, where the Admiralty already own land. In Section V (Govern-mcnt controlled Works) of my report I have already suggested that the area around Cardiff or Pembroke would be suitable for this purpose. If the Cardiff area is regarded as suitable it is my opinion that the establishment of a Government factory in or near Cardiff would be more beneficial as a means of alleviating unemployment, but I realise that Pembroke has an outstanding claim for Government controlled works owing to the fact that Pembroke Dock was brought into existence for this specific purpose in 1814.SECTION XIIISUMMARY OF report. Summary of RecommendationsSection IIUnemployment (and cognate issues) in the Area(1) That the depressed areas should have priority in all Labour Transference Schemes and vigorous efforts made to transfer to the more prosperous areas the surplus boys and the men between the ages of 18 and 45.(2) That as and when conditions warrant such a course, training facilities should be expanded, and the Ministry should, meanwhile, give consideration to the suitability of extending the length of the course in trades dependent on the individual skdl and craftsmanship of the trainee.(3) That as an experiment a Preparatory Training Centre be established in Merthyr or Tonypandy.(4) That consideration should be given to the questions of in-troducing more specialised courses in domestic training for women.(5) That the observations made in paragraph 53 designed to suggest improvement in the existing conditions as applied to juveniles, should receive careful consideration.
25(6) That in view of the substantial number of men who will be outside the transference or training field and are likely to be surplus to local requirements, the creation of new interests and occupations is a phase of activity that deserves encouragement and, as indicated in Section XI, the system of voluntary Occupational Centres is regarded as one which, operated on appropriate lines, may usefully be extended.In many localities the land in the Mining Valleys of South Wales is not very suitable for allotments but so far as practicable, I advocate their cultivation as a remedial measure, and the movement as one to be encouraged.Section IIICoal Mining Industry(1) That South Wales be promised that if the LCI. Hydrogenation Plant be proved an economic success, this area will be considered next. I consider that this should be done by the LCI. rather than by the coal companies.(2) That the future of gas road vehicles should be explored as closely as possible.(3) That to secure an increase in the coal export trade of South Wales the Board of Trade should endeavour to negotiate a Trade Agreement with Italy on the same lines as that concluded with the Scandinavian Countries, and also use all possible pressure on other Countries which, in the past, were large importers of Welsh Coal.South Wales has been penalised indirectly by the Trade Agree-ments entered into with the Scandinavian Countries, which operate in favour of the North-East Coast and which agreements may have driven Italy (which in the past imported large quantities of Welsh Coal) to conclude Trade Agreements (involving the purchase of coal) with Poland.(4) That every care should be taken when a mine is closed down to try and arrange for a certain portion of the miners employed to be transferred to an adjoining mine, or even to mines in other parts of the South Wales coalfield, so as to even out the hardships incurred. (This is already being done up to a certain point and is rendered much easier by the new roads that have been constructed and the use of motor buses.)(5) That the South Wales Coalfield Drainage Scheme should be proceeded with. This should provide work for approximately 2,000 men for about four years. As regards the question of financing the scheme, I am not in agreement with the views which I understand would be put forward by the South Wales Coal Owners. In my opinion, if H.M. Government considered it was necessaty for the future efficient working of the mines that this scheme should be adopted, this could only be done by loan facilities.
(6) The question of Royalties. I make no recommendation, though I know the point has been raised by the Durham Investigator, and the facts are already well known to H.M. Government. There is no doubt that in this area of South Wales some Royalties are very high, and a serious factor for a depressed industry to bear by way of increased cost of production.(7) I consider, owing to the present attitude of the South Wales Coal Owners and the Miners&apos; Representatives in this area, that the Government should appoint a man like Mr. Frank Hodges as Observer or Liaison Officer, who would be a great help in this district. I find he is still held in esteem by the best men in the Miners&apos; Federation, as well as the Coal Owners, and would carry much more weight than a permanent official in these Councils.As we may visualise the adoption of scientific methods in the use of coal, e.g., oil from coal, a man such as I am recommending would be of great assistance in the planning or setting out of these ideas, while he might also be able to give the necessary impetus to the problems of marketing coal along progressive lines, and also it would show South Wales that the Government are still taking a personal interest in the area, which counts a great deal in the minds of the people of South Wales.Section IVIron and Steel industry that an expert in the Iron and Steel Trade should be sent down to report on the future prospects of Ebbw Vale and Blaenavon so that the men can be told definitely if these Works can re-open or not. This is provided the present authorities responsible for these Works do not take the initiative themselves.Section VNew Industries and Government Controlled Works(1) That H.M. Government place one of their Factories under Government control in this area, which would probably be the means of other industries setting up in this locality.(2) That they might suggest to any large producers who contract for the Government that they would place a ten years&apos; firm contract with them, provided they produce in this distressed area.(3) That in a district where more than 50 per cent, of men are out of work, the Government might offer to subsidise the wages of the unemployed men taken on by any firm prepared to set up a factory in the district up to X per cent, for the first two 3&apos;ears.(4) That, if possible, the Board of Trade should make a special point of bringing to the notice of firms the coast-line area of Cardiff, Newport and Swansea.
(5) That a financial adviser, i.e., a post war chartered accountant, should be appointed to look into the questions of those smaller industries requiring extra capital, and where the report is satisfactory to put them in touch with companies such as Credit for Industries Ltd., Bute Street, Cardiff, an off-shoot of the United Dominions Trust Ltd.Section VILand Settlements, Small Holdings and Allotments(1) That the Distressed Areas have prior place in the question of Land Settlement.(2) That if Land Settlement is undertaken, it be done along the lines indicated by the Minister of Agriculture by placing the men on one large estate or tract of land, so as to make it possible for them to start off with co-operative buying and co-operative selling.(3) That these men should have a year&apos;s training in order to see that they are suitable for work on the land.(4) That these men should be given an allowance, or allowed to draw their unemployment pay for the first year that they are in their small-holdings.(5) That men of the type of County Directors of Agriculture should supervise these small-holdings for the first two or three years.I have made no recommendation as to the size of the holding, as it depends almost entirely on the quality of the land, its proximity to the markets, and its suitability for such ventures as market gardening.I have made no recommendation as to the ages of the men to be put on the land from this Distressed Area, as I think that some of the older men, who have agricultural knowledge, might be suit-able for this life. At the same time, I realise that one wants the younger men to take up these new ideas, which have never been extensively practised in this country.Section VII AfforestationAs there appears to be a general desire for afforestation in this area, I recommend that H.M. Government ask the Forestry Commission to prepare a scheme for this area, and if, after investigation, they consider it practical, they should give an extra grant through the Forestry Commission.Section IX Local Government Adniinistration(1) It will be well to wait until the effect of the new Unemploy-ment Insurance Act (Part II) on this area is ascertained as regards the Public Assistance Rate.   If this makes no substantial reduction
the position should be reviewed. (I think in these depressed areas they have a real grievance, as it is not through their fault that the coal industry has become so depressed.)(2) If it is possible the liquidation of the Goschen Loans might be extended to 20 years. (Eleven annual instalments of the original 15 remain to be paid.)(3) I would recommend to H.M. Government that it might be considered whether the time has now come for the promotion of legislation, or for the taking of such other measures as may be necessary to deal with local administrative units, such as Merthyr Tydfil, in which the method of government seems to be no longer appropriate to local conditions.Section XPublic Works(1) That slum clearances approved by the Minister of Health in this area should proceed.(2) That River Drainage and the setting up of Catchment Boards should be encouraged.(3) That the Ministry of Health should, if possible, allow Local Authorities to proceed with any Sewerage Schemes which are absolutely necessary from the health point of view.(4) That it might be possible to provide labour for certain Public Works on (1) the same basis as the Rheola Local Instructional Centre, i.e., men continue to receive Unemployment pay, plus 2s. per week, with dinner provided ; or (2) on the basis of the Agricultural rate of wages in the County concerned.Section XIVoluntary Social Service(1) That a Settlement and Warden be established in each Valley in South Wales. This might mean four or five additional Settlements.(2) That the formation of these Unemployed Clubs alluded to above be encouraged by every effort possible, so that their scope for development in other directions should proceed.(3) That encouragement and help should be given to the Workers&apos; Education Association, Welsh National Council of Music, and the Drama Movement.(4) That a block grant of  25,000 should be given to the South Wales Council of Social Service for the distressed area, and leave it to them to administer along the lines they consider it could best be spent. (I should leave it to them as I consider they are so well in touch with the situation.)

I am doubtful whether the Council have not over-estimated the labour-absorbing capacity of a factory of the size suggested by them, but the Ministry of Agriculture will no doubt be able to advise on this point.There is no factory in Wales, at present, and the County of Pembroke is most suitable for the growing of sugar beet. This is necessarily a question dependent on the Governments future policy with regard to sugar beet.(2) A Government factory might be established in the adjoining area, where the Admiralty already own land. In Section V (Govern-ment-controlled Works) of my report I have already suggested that the area round Cardiff or Pembroke would be suitable for this purpose. If the Cardiff area is regarded as suitable it is my opinion that the establishment of a Government factory in or near Cardiff would be more beneficial&apos; as a means of alleviating unemploy-ment, but I realise that Pembroke has an outstanding claim for Government-controlled works owing to the fact that Pembroke Dock was brought into existence for this specific purpose in 1814.2. Taking the figure of 81,000 unemployed, I give a table showing the approximate number of men who might be put back into employment if the Government accepted my recommendations. These figures must be regarded merely as a rough basis on which to work: 
3. In this general review of the position in the Eastern Section of the depressed area of South Wales, I desire in the first place to direct attention to my recommendations in Section V, which deals with new industries in the area. I consider these recommendations of extreme importance and would like them examined with great care.4. There are certain aspects in the present industrial situation in the area which concern the industrial future of the whole country&apos;, and to these I feel bound to allude.5. If one looks at the position of South Wales, which is practically entirely dependent on the Coal Trade, one can see the difficulty which must arise when any one part of the country depends solely on one industry alone for its livelihood ; when this industry declines, as it has done in this case by approximately 40 per cent., the area becomes a &quot;distressed area.&quot; I call attention to this factor, as it may arise in other parts of the United Kingdom relying on one industry alone.6. Another point which I want to bring to the notice of H.M. Government, and which becomes very apparent in South Wales, is the question of the reorganisation of the Steel Trade. From the point of view of efficiency and convenience a Steel Works is to be reconstructed at Cardiff and this wiU take the place of a Steel Works formerly operating in the Dowlais area. There are a number of Steel workers unemployed in the Cardiff area and only a small proportion of the men formerly employed at Dowlais can hope to secure employment at Cardiff. You therefore have unemployed communities left stranded at places like Dowlais, where many of the men have- bought their houses. Boroughs and Local Councils, who have spent thousands of pounds in days gone by, are left in a very difficult position. This will, and is, taking place in other parts of the country, where planning of Industry obtains.7. In the area in South Wales which I have been investigating, I cannot speak too highly of the work which is being done by the Ministry of Labour, both from the point of view of caring for the Unemployed, and placing as many men and girls as possible into jobs. The magnitude of their work, and the efficient and tactful way in which they carry it out, have been a revelation to me, but in my opinion-they are obliged to carry out their work under certain disadvantages.S. We are beginning in this country to plan economically for various trades ; new factories are put up in what are considered economic positions, and at the same time there is not sufficient
255thought given to the economic planning of labour supply, with the result that if this factor is not taken into consideration, distressed areas will be springing up in other places.9. The Board of Trade is familiar with the issues attached to the erection of new factories, and it is only in later years that the Ministry of Labour was created as a separate Department. I consider that wherever possible, when a new industry or factory is to be established, the question of labour, housing, etc., should be considered at the same time, and possibly one man in the Ministry should be responsible for the co-ordination of industry and labour. To carry my views a step further, one knows from personal experience that many firms perfer engaging their own labour than going to a Local Office of the Ministry of Labour, and the necessary co-operation between the Ministry of Labour and employers is therefore lacking, through no fault of the Ministry.In the result a large number of genuine workers brought up in a specific trade are left out of work and suffer accordingly, and it seems to me that the position is one which calls for careful con-sideration of whatever steps may be regarded as appropriate to get each industry to give the Ministry of Labour all the help possible towards placing in employment the workpeople concerned.10. To illustrate what I mean, Lord Nuffield started his large Motor Works at Cowley and nearly all his workers were recruited from the surrounding agricultural districts. The same thing is happening to-day. For instance, Richard Thomas &amp; Co., Ltd., Tinplate Manufacturers, in conjunction with the Whitehead Iron &amp; Steel Co., Ltd., have erected new steel works in Lincolnshire. The main reason for this move is, I understand, that ore is available on the spot. It has been rumoured also that there is a possibility of tinplates now manufactured in South Wales being produced in Lincolnshire. All this will mean that fresh labour will be recruited in the new area.The point I wish to stress is that if one plans industry one must try to find some means of planning labour supply at the same time.11. I also wish to amplify my remarks and recommendations with reference to financing existing small industries in need of more capital, and providing capital for new industries of the smaller kind. I am definitely of the opinion that the one or two existing organ-isations are not sufficiently of a national character for this purpose. One requires a Trust Company with four or five of the largest Industrialists on it, working possibly without remuneration, with one Financier and a full-time Managing Director. They should investigate the question of all these smaller industries, and Local Boards in the various areas should report on their prospects to a
Central Board. If this was carried out on a large scale it would give impetus to trade in this country and help areas like South Wales. All our former basic industries are declining, and as they are gradually being reorganised and rationalised, more men are becoming un-employed in these industries, and we have to look to the newer and smaller specialised industries to help us absorb our unemployed population. This is where an Industrial Trust Company, on really National lines, would be of immense value to us.12. I would like to finish my report, which I have the honour to submit to you, by saying that I should like to have the opportunity of going over and discussing it with either yourself, or any Minister who is to be responsible for the Reports from the four Distressed Areas.2nd July, 1934.(14560 c)   150   7/34
Private and Confidential256REPORTof aii Investigation by Captain D. EUAN WALLACE, M.C., M.P.(Civil Lord of the Admiralty),: :   : : &apos;into the Derelict Areas of Durham and Tyneside with conclusions and recommendations
Co. DURHAM ANDTYNESIDE.

ADMIRALTY,21th July, 1934.&quot;fhe Rt. Hon. Oliver Stanley, P.C., M.P., Ministry of Labour.My clear Stanley,I send you herewith the result of the special investigation which I have made into the derelict areas in Durham and Tyneside, in accordance with the announcement made by your predecessor in the House of Commons on 19th April.I have endeavoured to limit my Report to those general considera-tions which may be of assistance to the Cabinet in formulating the policy to be pursued for the relief of the abnormal unemployment in this district, and for the reasons which follow I have made no attempt to apply in detail the results of the conclusions which I have formed.In the first place, it seems that their practical application could only be worked out after full departmental discussion by the responsible Minister. Secondly, any attempt to expound a detailed policy would have made it impossible for me to present this Report before the House rises. And thirdly, the Report would in this case have assumed dimensions which would inevitably detract from its value.Thanks to the industry and ability of my staff, a great deal of detailed information relating to various aspects of the problem and its particular application to individual localities is now available and would, I believe, prove of great value in carrying out such proposals as may be accepted by the Government.It is difficult for me to give adequate expression to my appreciation of the work of my two assessors, Commdr. J. B. Adams, C.B.E., D.S.O., your Divisional Controller for the North-East Area, and Mr. K. W. Grant, General Inspector of the Ministry of Health for District No. 13, and my Secretary, Mr. C. P. Kesteven, Manager of the Newcastle Employment Exchange ; it was only their energy, enthusiasm, ability and local knowledge which enabled the data upon which this Report is based to be collected in the time available.I must mention in addition Mr. Colin Forbes Adam, C.S.I., who acted as my personal assistant and remained at the office in Newcastle when I was unavoidably absent; his assistance during the whole investigation, and particularly in the preparation of this Report, has been invaluable.Yours sincerely,EUAN WALLACE.(14606 C)B
REPORTSECTION I THE UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEMA. Scope and Method of Investigation1. The Memorandum of Instructions handed to the Investigators at their meeting with representatives of the Cabinet laid down certain broad lines upon which a general survey of the derelict areas in their districts might proceed. Although in regard to its general aspects the investigation was found naturally to develop along the lines thus indicated, there emerged immediately a conclusion of great importance which must be stated at the outset.Whether from the standpoint of the causes which have led to the present state of affairs, or from that of the remedies which can be applied to it, it has proved quite impracticable to isolate certain parts of the area, such as the town of Jarrow or particular villages in the Durham coalfield, and to consider them apart from their surroundings.Both causes and remedies are closely interconnected. The industries upon which the life of the area depends, although they may be geographically separable, are economically interdependent. The mass of labour, although it has deep roots in the County of Durham or on Tyneside, is within the limits of those areas accustomed to move naturally and without difficulty. The psychological effects of the depression are not confined to particular spots, but permeate the whole region. And finally, the results of any remedies of a ipng-term nature which may be proposed cannot by any possibility be contained within narrow limits, but must of necessity be considered in their relation to a wider area.2. Tiie eastern and western boundaries of this area can be easily defined, but its definition to the north and south was not so simple. Professor Hallsworth, who was generally responsible for the Armstrong College Survey, is of opinion that its natural boundaries, as an economic unit, are the North Yorkshire moors and the Cheviots. His survey had, however, a less limited objective than the present investigation and it seemed that lor the latter purpose the whole area north of Tyneside could be disregarded. This elimination may, from some points of view, be considered as drastic, but the short answer to those who may object to such a curtailment is that, by cpmparison with Durham, Northumberland is prosperous. The definition of the southern boundary presented even greater difficulty, but the primary consideration, in view of the urgent nature of the problem,
appeared to be to reduce the field of survey to the smallest dimen-sions which considerations of homogeneity would permit. From this point of view the deciding factors were, first, that Tees-side is largely dependent upon the iron and steel industry, which has outlets for its production not confined to the north-east coast ; secondly, that it has benefited, to a greater extent than any other neighbouring centre of population, by the setting up of a large new plant by Imperial Chemical Industries at Billingham ; and thirdly, that if Tees-side, better situated from the point of view of cmploy-mcnt as it is, were taken into the field of enquiry, there could be no valid argument against including also the Cleveland district of Yorkshire and thereby considerably extending the time required to complete the Report.For these reasons the investigation has dealt neither with isolated centres of population nor with the whole North East Coast area, but with Tyneside and the County of Durham, excluding the valley of the Tees and the agricultural district immediately to the north of it.3. Since it lias been found impracticable to isolate those places to which the term &quot; derelict &quot; may properly be applied, it is of vita! importance to realise that the area as a whole does not answer to this description ; portions of it are certainty up to the general average of industrial activity, and some places can fairly be regarded as prosperous.4. The first step taken was to chaw up a questionnaire designed to procure such information as would provide a full and accurate picture of the state of affairs obtaining in each town and village in the area. The work of replying to it was undertaken by the managers of the Employment Exchanges and performed with an expedition and ability which, seeing that they were at the same time engaged upon their ordinary duties, were quite beyond praise. I have been profoundly impressed, throughout the whole course of my investiga-tion, with the enthusiasm and understanding which these officers bring to bear upon every question connected with their official duties. They appear without exception to have established the best possible relations with employers, Trade Unions and the individual un-employed, with the result that they command a widespread con-fidence, entirely justified b3&apos; the combination of accurate knowledge with fair and sympathetic dealing which all classes admit that they emploj&apos;.With their expert help it was possible to procure answers to the questionnaire, which provided a mass of vital information in a form in which it has not before been readily available. While this information was being collected, I endeavoured as far as possible to establish personal contact with cverj&apos; local authority of importance in the area, every employers&apos; and employees&apos; association, public bodies such as the Tyne Improvement Commission, and all individuals who, upon the information at my disposal from local or other sources.
* The date taken for the Questionnaire.(14606C)appeared to be in a position to furnish facts or suggestions which might be of value. I was able also to visit and spend some time in villages which could be regarded as typical of the worst parts of the coalfield, and to make myself acquainted with the whole district of Tyneside on both banks of the river. And finally I inspected various training and instructional centres established in the area, and made a tour of a number of social service centres under the auspices of the Tyneside Council of Social Service.These visits and conversations enabled me to obtain a valuable impression of what may be called the &quot; psychological climate &quot; of the area, to which later reference will be made, and also a background upon which to assemble the facts and statistics collected.B. Extent and Causes of Unemployment5. The formidable extent of the unemployment problem appears even from the most general survey of the figures. On 4th June, 1934,* 137,441 males and 10,499 females, making a total of 147,940, were wholly unemployed. This disparity between the sexes does not mean that female employment exists upon a large scale, but simply that the area has been, and still is, principally dependent upon the heavier industries. If light industries could be introduced, there would be no difficulty in finding women to work in them : at present they do not come upon the Register.If 1929 be taken as a standard post-war year and the period June, 1932, to June, 1933, as the peak period of unemployment arising out of the slump, the live register shows the following figures : 24th June, 1929      ......       SO, 11527th June, 1932      ......      196,15726th June, 1933      ......      192,40425th June, 1934      ......      165,873In order, therefore, to get back to the figure of 1929 when there were still a million unemployed in the country a total of S5.75S must be removed from unemployment, and even on the assumption that the rate of progress hitherto maintained will continue in the area, we shall in 1937 still have 80,000 unemployed, with a general standard of employability that cannot fail to be much lower than it is today.6. The real gravity of the situation may be further illustrated by the fact that 63,046 persons have already been out of work for more than 2 years, 40,729 for more than 3 years, 18,540 for more than 4 years and 9,246 for more than 5 years. An analysis from another aspect gives a total of 52,506 unemployed men who are married and over the age of 35.These figures make only too apparent the persistence of unemploy-ment in the area, the urgenc)&apos; of the whole problem and the great difficulties that will have to be faced in dealing with it.
7. In considering the incidence of unemployment according to industries the following extract from the live register for 4th June, 1934, is significant:  .Shipbuilding and Ship-repairing .. 25,300 Engineering (Marine and General)    ..    11,900Shipping ..       ......     5,900Coalmining      ..       ..       ..       ..    40,100Total  83,200The balance is made up mainly of persons attached to trades ancillary to the basic industries, such as dock and harbour service, rope manufacture etc., and to industries which, in common with the rest of the country, show considerable expansion, like building, distributive, transport and entertainment. The last named groups, whilst giving considerable relief over the whole field of employment, have attracted to themselves some thousands of workers surplus to the requirements of the basic industries, and now show an excess of labour supply for which the basic industries are really responsible.8. The immediate causes of the phenomenal decline in shipping, the decrease in international trade and the disadvantages from which British shipping now suffers in competing for its share, are too well known to need elaboration.The decline in shipping has reacted severely upon shipbuilding, ship-repairing and marine engineering, which depend directly for their well-being upon the prosperity of the mercantile marine ; upon the iron and steel industry, which relies to a considerable extent upon the demand from these trades ; and upon coalmining, which looks for a market in large part to the activity of the blast furnaces.The present position of employment in these industries would be sufficiently serious if it were only necessary to measure the drop from pre-war standards, but the situation has been greatly aggravated by the immense temporary extension of activity due to war-time conditions. The policy of National Shipbuilding Securities, Ltd., is in itself sufficient proof of the permanent redundancy of much of the labour now settled in the neighbourhood.Palmer&apos;s yard at Jarrow provides the most complete and tragic-picture of the series of events which have led to this investigation. In 1851 a village of 7,000 inhabitants, Jarrow is today a borough with a population of 36,000, who were, until a short time ago, almost entirely dependent for their livelihood upon an immense establish-ment fully equipped to apply to the crude raw material every process necessary to turn it into the finished ship. The yard has now been acquired by National Shipbuilding Securities, Ltd., and cannot be used for the next forty years for new construction. The result is that 6,140 persons, or 56-8 per cent, of the insured population of Jarrow, are now unemployed ; and that, apart from the sum ol over  48,000 received in unemployment benefit during the last
twelve months, its inhabitants are absorbing from national and local resources relief in the form of Transitional Payments and Public Assistance at the rate of over  300,000 a year.9. The decline in employment in coalmining is also principally due to the contraction of foreign markets and to the general dislocation of international trade : the former has accounted directly for a 3S per cent, reduction between 1929 and 1933 in shipments from the Durham coalfield, while the latter has been the indirect cause of a large part of the 30 per cent, reduction in inland sales.There are in addition three subsidiary factors : in some pits in the extreme west of the area natural resources have been exhausted ; the consequent cessation of pumping operations has resulted in the flooding of still valuable seams further east; and the increased use of mechanical appliances has reduced the number of men required for a given output.While the two former serve at present only to aggravate the difficulties of unemployment without increasing its total volume, the effects of the latter are already felt and will become more important as time goes on. It is not possible to give an exact estimate of the proportion of labour displaced when a colliery becomes mechanically equipped to the maximum extent, but the figure might reasonably be put at 30 per cent., and it is improbable that scientific advance in this direction has reached its limits.10. General engineering, the unemployment figures for which cannot readily be separated from those for the marine branch of the industry, has been chiefly concerned with the making of armaments and the construction of locomotives, and is practically confined to Newcastle and Gateshead. The armament industry has suffered in the same way as the shipyards. The war led to an immense expansion of productive capacity and subsequent political developments have reduced demands to well below the pre-war level.In regard to locomotive construction, the removal of the L.N.E.R. works to Darlington has hit the town of Gateshead very severely, and may be the prelude to further concentration of a similar kind. The firms engaged in locomotive construction for export have suffered from a diminishing market&apos; and severe competition, due to the development of engineering activity in other countries.11. In regard to the question of what proportion of the present un-tinployed population must be regarded as a permanent surplus, Mr. H. Montgomerie, of the Ministry of Labour, in his Memorandum on the Industrial Surveys of the Depressed Areas, said : &quot; When account is taken of the variety and number of factors, present and prospective, which are likely to exercise some kind of influence, large or small, upon the labour surplus of particular areas, the task of estimating its magnitude must clearly be highly speculative and the result, when achieved, lacking in scientific precision.&quot; (14606C) c 2
He proceeded to point out the nature of the fundamental difficulties of the task and the very wide differences of approach and treatment exhibited by the Surveys of 1931. Apart from the fact that the work of estimating the extent of the surplus has already been undertaken for the North East Coast by persons much better qualified and more fully equipped with the necessary resources who have put the figure at 64,000-it appears to be sufficient for all practical purposes to establish beyond doubt that in the area under investigation &quot; there exists a large body of workpeople who are definitely surplus to requirements and for whom provision will have to be made.&quot; This is the conclusion which Mr. Montgomerie drew from the Industrial Survey of 1931, and it emerges with equal clearness from the present investigation.A further examination of the precise extent.of this surplus appears to be unnecessary, not only because there is no reason to suppose that it would produce a more dependable result, but also because it is quite evident that such remedial measures as can be put in hand in the near future are not in the least likely to reduce the surplus to a point at which local demand will even approximate to local supply.C.  General Effect upon the Area12. In the course of the investigation it has been impossible to avoid a strong general impression that the area as a whole is losing hope. Although the individuals affected are displaying great courage and remarkable powers of endurance, the vitality of the whole body has been sapped by depression. This condition appears to be markedly worse in the larger towns than it is in the coalmining villages, in spite of the fact that in the latter the proportion of unemployed workers is often larger and the duration of unemployment has been in many cases longer. The reasons are not far to seek. The un-employed pitman inhabiting a vdlage with a population of a few thousands is within easy reach of open fields, and in the summer at any rate he and his children can spend most of their time in fresh air and country surroundings. The unemployed man who resides in an industrial borough lives in conditions which are both physically and mentally much less healthy and more depressing, and most of his time is inevitably spent standing at the corners of streets of closely packed houses, while his children have little better sur-roundings in which to play.The fact that the whole investigation was carried out in the middle of a particularly fine summer cannot be ignored ; a series of visits during bad weather or short dark days could not fail to have left a much more painful impression.13. The steady exodus from the area which has taken place since the time of the General Strike has also had its effect upon the general standard of the population. The census figures for 1921 and 1931 show that during that ten-year period, 14S.496 persons migrated from the County of Durham ; and inter-censal estimates made by
the Registrar-General indicate that while not more than 19,000 of these moved in the first quinquennium, over 129,000 moved between 1926 and 1931. This figure of 148,496 represents 10 per cent, of the total population, and this large proportion must have included the most able and active members of the community who could find no local employment. Moreover, in addition to the migration out of the area, there has been a very considerable move-mcnt within it, taking the best men from the older mines in the south-west of the coalfield, which were waterlogged or worked out, to the newer pits in the north-west or the east of the county. The effect of this movement can be clearly seen in the villages of the Bishop Auckland area, where a high percentage of the population must be considered as below the average standard of employability.The detailed enquiries which have been made into the conditions in each centre of population have also brought to light the fact that, parallel with the exodus of the most active members of the un-empioyed, tnere has been taking place an influx of a much less desirable element. The closing down of a colliery has frequently resulted in the sale at scrap prices of large blocks of houses, the purchasers of which can afford to let them for the very lowest rents and still make a sufficient profit. These houses, no matter how unsatisfactory their condition, offer an undoubted attraction to the most impoverished, and probably also to that small section of the population which has no desire for work. For instance, while 75 families have left the village of Witton Park and Woodside since 1928, 102 have moved in.14. The cumulative effect of these factors, which are the result of prolonged and widespread unemployment, has undoubtedly tended to aggravate the feeling of depression and to produce that attitude of resignation which, apart from its convenience to constituted authority, must be regarded with grave anxiety.15. The investigation has not afforded any reason to dissent from the general conclusion arrived at by the Chief Medical Officer of the -Ministry of Health on page 41 of his Report for the year 1932, that &quot; there is at present no available medical evidence of any general increase in physical impairment, in sickness or in mortality, as the result of economic depression or unemployment.&quot; The same view, with one important qualification which discloses an abnormally high percentage of malnutrition among boys aged 14 to 16, has been arrived at as the result of special enquiries recently ordered by the Minister of Health into certain districts of Durham and Tyneside : one of the conclusions reached by the enquiring officers being that &quot; the trend of health statistics of recent years affords no evidence of a deterioration in the health of the population.&quot;16. This state of affairs is, however, only made possible by the health services administered by the local authorities and by the relief afforded from public funds ; and of the total of such funds provided
by the whole country the proportion which is expended in this area is distressingly large Transitional Payments and Public Assistance reaching a total of  7,500,000 a year, or more than double the amount per capita expended in the country as a whole. By this means a tolerable standard of subsistence is generally maintained, but there is no return in the shape of increased recuperative powers.17. It is a most depressing fact that the results of this immense annual expenditure should amount at best to no more than the stabilisation of a state of affairs presenting so many undesirable features. Prolonged unemployment is destroying the confidence and self-respect of a large part of the population, their fitness for work is being steadily lost and the anxiety of living always upon a bare minimum without any margin of resources or any hope of improvement is slowly sapping their nervous strength and their powers of resistance. Instances occur of men who have been out of employment for long periods being unable to stand the return to work. They find new conditions obtaining in the shops, they themselves are lacking in confidence and vitality, and as a result they throw up the job, often after only a few hours, although an increase in earnings means everything to them.18. The fact that it has been necessary to report upon the area as a whole must inevitably result in obscuring the gravity of the situation in places which are really derelict, of which the following are examples : (1) In the village of Leasingthome, with a population of 585 persons, the annual cost of Transitional Payments and Public Assistance is  9,952, 98 per cent, of those on the - live register having ceased to be eligible for Unemployment Insurance. - -(2) In Butterknowle, which has a population of 1,625, 32 per cent, of those on the live register have been unemployed for more than 5 years.(3) Witton Park and Woodside has a total population of 2.60S : 671 persons are on the live register, which may be said to account for practically the entire population available for work, and 49 per cent, of these are drawing neither Unemployment Benefit nor Transitional Payments.The urgent necessity for arresting this decline and setting in motion some process of recuperation cannot be over-emphasised.19. Tables I, II and III contain some statistical analyses of the figures relating to existing unemployment, designed to illustrate the various points which have so far been made. For this purpose, it has been found simplest to divide the area geographically into four main sections and to deal with each separately.
Although these divisions are in no sense separate entities and the boundaries between them are necessarily somewhat arbitrary, each one presents certain general characteristics peculiar to itself.Tyneside is the largest area of dense population and of ship-building and engineering activity.South West Durham includes the oldest workings in the coalfield and the pits which have been most affected by the influx of water.East Durham contains the seams of sea coal and has been the latest area to be developed for coalmining : the inclusion of Sunder-land and the Hartlepools on geographical grounds has appreciably increased the average figures of unemployment and rate burdens for this section.The remainder of the area, described as North West Durham, is on the whole the division in which the effects of unemployment have been least felt.The map attached to this Report shows these divisions, with the Local Authority and Employment Exchange areas.SECTION II PROSPECTS OF INDUSTRIAL REVIVALA. Shipping, SMpbuuding and Marine Engineering20. The description already given of the causes and extent of un-employment in the area of investigation, leads inevitably to the conclusion that in any predictable future shipping and its ancillary industries cannot hope to recover the same degree of activity that they enjoyed in the years before 1914, and upon which they attached to themselves so large an employable population.The Government has already announced a policy designed to assist shipping and shipbuilding, but a considerable time must of necessity elapse before the reviving effect of this policy can be estimated ; and a permanent recrudescence of activity in these industries must still wait upon international agreements, as the outcome of changes in economic policy which do not at present seem probable.21. Whilst it is logical, therefore, to conclude that there will remain attached for a long time to these industries a considerable surplus of population for whom no employment will be available, a clear dis-tinction must be drawn between the prospects of the skilled and unskilled workers. The shipbuilders have on several occasions issued an emphatic warning that, should conditions again demand any marked degree of activity in their industry, there is likely to be a definite shortage of skilled labour. Although the workers&apos; organisa-tions do not accept this view, it seems probable that, owing to the
prolongation of the period of abnormal unemployment and to the difficulty of training skilled men in any way except upon the actual construction of a ship, there may be here a problem of minor dimensions. The possibility of meeting the difficulty to some extent through the agency of the Government Training Centres is already being examined by the Ministry of Labour, and it does not in any case affect the major problem of the surplus of labour of all classes remaining attached to these industries.It might be held that the general prospects of employment in the shipyards will be improved by the re-organisation of the shipbuilding industry now proceeding. Better organisation will undoubtedly provide more security for those employed ; it may be that it will result in an increase of competitive power which will eventually provide more work ; but it cannot, in view of world conditions, be expected in the near future to add appreciably to the demand for labour.22. There is a further consideration to which, in my view, great importance must be attached in any discussion of the prospects of the industries of the area namely the fact that their financial position has steadily deteriorated to a point at which it must seriously hamper the possibilities of local revival. The prosperity of this area wras established at the time of the industrial revolution and continued over more than a generation, so that it became an article of faith with most of those concerned that nothing could arrest its progress. As a result, when troubles were met with, the remedj&apos; generally relied upon was what American journalists graphically describe as &quot; a shot in the arm&quot;. Money was raised, upon the basis of assets rather than earning power, by means of debenture issues which have since hung like mill-stones round the necks of the various concerns and gradually pressed them into the hands of the banks. It is hardly an exaggeration to &quot;state that today the banks control the position, and that without their consent very few shipbuilding firms could undertake an order.23. The situation that has to be faced by each of the industries in this group is in broad outline the same ; an extraordinary increase in output capacity to meet war demands, followed by a reduction in naval construction to considerably below the pre-war normal; parallel to this, substantial increase in output capacity by foreign countries, with the competitive advantages of our experience, large subsidies and less rigid labour conditions ; and finally, a catastrophic shrinkage of world trade and consequently of shipping activity, upon which shipbuilding and marine engineering depend.There appears, therefore, to be only one practical step which the Government could take permanently to increase employment in the shipbuilding industry on the Tyne and the Wear, and this would involve so fundamental a change in the whole position of the Govern-ment as a purchaser as will in all probability exclude it from con-
sidcration ab initio. It would be nothing less than the abandonment of the well-established system of purchase by competitive tender, with all the advantages, political as well as economic, which are inherent in it, and the utilisation of the purchasing power of Government Departments as an instrument of policy.The overwhelming arguments in favour of the existing system need not be re-stated. Upon the other side it is urged, first that the serious unemployment in this area is a national and not a regional problem : secondly, that in a time of national emergency the ship-yards undertook at the mandate of the State commitments which have undeniably been in part the cause of their present difficulties : and finally, that national interests require that they should be maintained in a condition to meet a much larger demand for con-struction than is now being made upon them.It is believed that, other things being equal, some Government departments already give preference to areas of severe unemploy-ment ; and it might be possible, without abandoning the general principle, to issue instructions that this practice should be generally followed.The fact will, however, remain that, as far as these three industries are concerned, the conclusion arrived at in the Industrial Survey of 1931 must be assented to. The problem facing them is &quot; one of scaling down to meet a diminished demand, which is likely to be permanent, rather than one of expansion.&quot;B.  General Engineering24. As has already been pointed out, general engineering in this area has been principally concerned in the past with armaments and the construction of locomotives. National policy has since the War been directed towards the establishment of conditions which wdl render unnecessary the construction of armaments upon any but the most moderate scale : the home raUways are constructing their own loco-motives in their own shops, all situated outside this area : and foreign countries are stdl endeavouring to expand their productive capacity in this direction.25. Prospects of revival in this industry must therefore depend upon the success with which the existing plants can be adapted to other forms of production, and it is encouraging to note that this process of adaptation has already begun. To take one instance, Messrs. Vickers Armstrongs have undertaken the manufacture of Bliss Presses with such success that they have already captured the home market and are supplying the requirements of British motor manufacturers. Nor is there any reason to believe that the process cannot be continued : signs are appearing that scientific discovery will before long bring about considerable changes in the method of railway traction, and that the engineering industry of the a^ea is alive to this possibdity and prepared to be early hi the field.

In the promotion of a revival on these lines, private enterprise should take the lead and direct Government intervention is not required. As the Industrial Survey of 1931 pointed out, &quot; transition from one kind of industrial activity to another under the stress of economic forces- would be no new phase in the industrial history of this country.&quot; It must, however, be recognised that, whereas the decline from the intense activity of production occasioned by the War was startling in rapidity and extent, the transition now begin-ning must be a slow and laborious process which will not for many years absorb more than a limited proportion of those now registered as attached to the industry.C.  Coal-miriing26. Any examination of the prospects of a revival of the coal industry of Durham is necessarily complicated by the uncertain nature of most of the factors involved. For example, most of the pits produce more than one kind of coal, and precise information is not available as to the extent to which they are dependent on the various classes of trade, such as coking, gas, bunkers or industrial, nor as to the disposal of the various classes of coal.A survey carried out by the Mines Department has, however, provided some valuable information upon which to base provisional conclusions. This survey covered in all 100 mines, at 37 of which output could be increased, and 31 of which were nearing exhaustion, and disclosed that the two groups gas and coking coal cover the greater part of the production of the coalfield. It follows, therefore, that future recovery must depend largely upon the prospects of these two classes.27. The total extent of the reduction in the output of the Durham coalfield and the approximate distribution of the Durham trade as between shipments and inland are shown by the following figures : Coal raised .. 39,001,000 27,606,000 11,395,000 29 Shipments .. 24,675,000 17,641,000 7,034,000 28 Inland ..       ..   14,326,000     9,965,000      4,361,000      30The extent to which Durham gas coal and coking coal (which is also concerned, though to a lesser extent, with the overseas trade) can recover a substantial share of the lost foreign market must depend upon international conditions. It will be generally admitted that the Government is doing everything possible by means of the Trade Agreements to help the coalmining industry, and that these agreements have already afforded some assistance to the Durham coal producers. Even upon a long view, however, it is difficult to visualise a return to the 1929 level of exports.1929. Tons.1933. Tons.Reduction in 1933. Tons.    Percentage of 1929.
As far as coal for inland disposal is concerned, the recovery of some part at least of the lost coking coal market must depend upon a revival in the iron and steel industry, of which signs are already apparent. If trade conditions at home continue to improve, the output of coal for inland market may recover to something near the 1929 level ; and if the new plant at Billingham proves equal to a prolonged practical test, the erection of further plants may add to the demand for Durham coal.Taking home and export markets together, it would, according to the Mines Department, be rash to anticipate, upon the evidence now available, more than a 60 per cent, recovery of the loss in output which occurred between 1929 and 1933 ; and even this estimate might well prove to be on the high side.28. It has already been pointed out that mechanisation of the mines in the area is steadily taking place, and that the process considerably reduces the amount of labour required per unit of output. When it is realised that scientific discovery has by no means reached its limit in this direction and that not all the mines are as yet equipped with mechanical appliances, it becomes clear that employment cannot be expected to increase in proportion to sales.The survey already referred to estimates the permanent surplus of labour, very tentatively, at between 20,000 and 25,000 persons, and the comparable figure arrived at by the Industrial Survey of 1931 was about 30,000; but for reasons already given, no attempt will be made to examine the precision of these estimates. For practical purposes it is sufficient to recognise that a considerable permanent surplus must be anticipated.29. No investigation of the state of affairs in Durham can fail, however, to leave the impression that the coalmining industry in the area is not at present in a position to use to the best advantage the opportunities which may arise of recovering its lost markets.A more thorough examination of the problem of flooding in the pits south of the Butterknowle fault, which was referred to in an Interim Report (reproduced as Appendix I) reveals still more clearly the state of disorganisation which at present exists. It cannot be denied that the water in this area and the lack of co-operative measures for dealing with it constitute a menace to pits now working further east, and, if any considerable expansion of markets took place, opportunities of providing employment in some of the worst hit villages in the area would be lost because valuable coal could not be won except at a prohibitive cost.It has already been recommended that urgent consideration should be given to some scheme for the unification of the ownership of royalties. If the industry is to make the best of its chances of recovery, it must have a common policy and the means to carry it out: but no reorganisation, having this end in view, appears possible(14606 C) d 2
unless unification of the ownership of royalties has first been accom-plished. This step is the essential preliminary, and it is strongly recommended that early consideration should be given to devising the best method of achieving it.D.  Introduction of New Industries30. The introduction of new industries into the area under investigation is of major importance as far as the problem of future employment is concerned, since it would provide a much needed improvement in the industrial balance, and so minimise the possibility that the working population will again succumb to an epidemic of unemployment upon so large a scale.In this connection, the light industries which, as a result of scientific development, appear likely to displace progressively the heavier trades in many forms of new construction have a special employment value, since they belong generally speaking to the &quot; large labour and small capital &quot; group.As matters stand at present, the State is not in a position to direct the location of any new British industry or even to offer inducements towards a particular area, except in the case of an actual Government establishment such as Woolwich Arsenal, or of a business where the volume of Government orders would make compliance with the Governments wishes an overriding consideration. The possibility that the Air Ministry might feel able in the event of an increased construction programme to insist that the demand should be met from dispersed centres of production was discussed with the Chief of the Air Staff; and it is recognised that the vulnerability of this area to air attack rules out such a proposal in its case. There may, however, be other manufactures in regard to which Durham and Tyneside could benefit by such insistence, as for example the produc-tion of mechanised transport for the&apos; Army. As far as employers manufacturing for ordinary public demand are concerned, it would certainly appear that they have not so far felt obliged to give sufficient weight to the existing domicile of their prospective employees. Both as regards the expansion of existing works and the establishment of new industries it has generally been assumed that where employment is provided, a working population will be available. Even if the Government accepts the view that the time has come to plan the location of industry in the best interests of the body politic, the most which can be done&apos;in the first instance is to remove or minimise the causes which operate to exclude certain areas from the industrial developments which are now taking place.31. According to the Survey of Industrial Development, 1933, issued by the Board of Trade, the new factories opened in the years 1932 and 1933 provided employment for 83,250 persons, of whom only 900 found work in Northumberland, Durham and the North Riding of Yorkshire.   It might have been hoped that the enquiry
conducted by the Board of Trade, and published in the document just referred to, would have furnished conclusive evidence as to the reasons, for the failure of this area to attract new industries ; but the reasons there tabulated are too many and too diverse to enable definite conclusions to be drawn from them.Special attention has therefore been devoted to an attempt to identify these causes by means of evidence locally obtained.32. Rightly or wrongly, the burden of high rates is the most frequently quoted. As already stated, a vicious circle has been established : an area which, by reason of its industrial development in one cycle has become populous, cannot arrest its industrial decline by substituting developing industries for those that are contracting, because the very contraction which it seeks to remedy imposes a burden which acts as a strong deterrent to new industrial influx. It is true that, owing to the derating of industrial hereditaments, the burden is not actually so grievous as might appear at first sight : but the competitive handicap remains and there is in addition a real, if unreasonable, psychological effect.33. Next there is the impression that the Trade Unions in the area are inflexible and difficult to deal with. My own view is that this is really a case of an unfortunate &quot; lag &quot; between present deserts and past reputation, and that there exists to-day an amount of good will in the relationship between employers&apos; and employees&apos; associa-tions which wdl stand comparison with the conditions obtaining anywhere else in the country. In support of this contention it should be noted that in Northumberland and Durham the average number of working days lost by disputes per person involved was 2-2, 3-1 and 13-0 for the years 1930, 1931 and 1932 respectively, as against 14-0, 14-2 and 17-1 for Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a whole.On the other hand, the fact that the local administration of County Durham is now generally regarded as a stronghold of Socialism is unlikely to prejudice industrialists in its favour.34. There is, moreover, a third psychological factor which cannot be omitted from any diagnosis of the present situation : the unfortunate reputation which the area has acquired by reason of five years of dwindling export trade. In spite of the natural advantages it offers to industry, a region where so many abandoned pits, closed shipyards, derelict buildings and unemployed men are plainly visible, is severely handicapped in competition with localities where trade can be seen to be expanding.35. My own impression is that the most formidable difficulty lies in the fact that Durham and Tyneside are geographicaUy too remote from what is regarded as the largest market for the sale of those goods which the new light industries are principally engaged in producing. There is, moreover, an unfortunate tendency to under-estimate the potentialities of the area itself in this direction ; first
of all on account of the large proportion of its inhabitants who are known to be existing on the reduced standard, of living imposed by unemployment, and secondly because the large number of local government units effectively conceals the real extent of the population.36. It is also indubitably true that Tyneside and the North East Coast in general offer special advantages to those industries which cater for overseas consumption, and that as the process continues whereby the importance of the home market increases and that of the export market lessens, these special advantages arc losing much of their effect.37. Another serious handicap to the promotion of fresh enterprises was particularly stressed by those in the area who, judged by the standards of their past achievements or the width of their present outlook, appeared best qualified to speak. The post-war rationalisation-tion of our banking system has resulted in the extinction of the smaller concerns with definite local associations, with the inevitable result that financial accommodation on anything but a very modest scale must be sought in London; and it has been suggested that in such circumstances capital assets or past balance sheets appear to be accepted as more important criteria than the earning capacity of any new venture.38. A considerate on of the whole problem in the light of these factors leads to the conclusion that definite action is required upon the lines indicated below, if this area is to have a chance of attracting its share of those industries which have a prospect of development: (1) The unequal burden imposed by high rates due to unemploy-ment should be removed. However great the difficulties to be encountered in adopting a policy which must inevitably have reactions throughout the whole country, it seems quite clear that this question will have to be faced as an essential element in the solution of the problem. Apart from the fact that the present situation does not appear to be defensible on grounds of equity or logic, its effect upon the depressed areas is not constant but cumulative. Some concrete proposals for meeting it are put forward in Section III, which deals with Local Government.(2) Abandoned sites, particularly on Tyneside, should be cleared of their dreary and forbidding accumulation of rubbish heaps and derelict buildings, which cry aloud to every visitor a message only too easily translated into the words &quot; Keep off.&quot; The possibilities of action in this direction appear to be more suitable for discussion in connection with an immediate policy of finding work and are referred to in Section VI.(3) Whilst it is recognised that such organisations as Credit for Industries Ltd. have been set up for the express purpose of promoting more internal investment, it hardly appears that these
arrangements are adequate to cope with the local situation, since their activities are limited to financing the expansion of existing businesses, and the rate of interest varies between A\ per cent, and 6 per cent. A small Industrial Development Company was formed in Newcastle in 1933 by persons who were more concerned to provide work than to secure an adequate return on their capital: within the limitations imposed by its financial resources it has proved of real value, and I believe that some such organisation upon a much larger scale would -be worthy of Government support. There are possibilities that one or more sites could be acquired suitable for development upon the lines of the Trading Estates at Slough or Trafford Park, and there is no doubt that the provision of these facilities makes a special appeal to the promoter of any new business.This proposal is made with considerable reserve, since it is recog-nised that the whole problem of the most effective use of our national credit, and the largely increased savings of our people, for the provision of more employment is not only outside tire scope of the present investigation, but requires for its solution the most detaded know-ledge and prolonged study.(4) The area itself must endeavour to make more effective use of the advantages which it can offer to industry, as a port, as a source of raw material, and as a market.&quot;When Sir Horace Wdson visited Newcastle in 1932 he discussed this question with the Committee of the Tyneside Industrial Confer-ence which was then considering it, and pointed out to them the advantages of an Area Development Board on the lines of those which have been set up in Scotland, Lancashire and South Wales.At present the efforts made in this direction have not been successful, and the reason is undoubtedly the lack of acknowledged leadership. Local authorities, of which there are thirteen on Tyneside alone, are frequently jealous of one another and lacking in the spirit of co-operation. Since the investigation started, it appears that a further attempt is about to be made to overcome these obstacles, and if people of such acknowledged reputation in the area as Mr. Runciman and Lord Londonderry could bring the weight of their influence to bear upon those concerned a successful outcome might be hastened.        ,(5) Special attention should be paid to the case of Sunderland. The industrial area at the mouth of the Wear is in fact isolated from the rest of the North East Coast, and has not shared in such measure of revival as has already come to the Tyne. Whereas the unemploy-ment figures for the whole area have shown a steady, if slight, improvement since 1932, the number of persons unemployed in Sunderland today is 1,773 more than it was a year ago. The best hope of its industrial revival seems to lie in the possibility that one of the existing firms of motor manufacturers which has now, thanks to the reduction in the horse-power tax, a good prospect of expanding
its overseas market, might be persuaded to set up a branch factory in Sunderland. To do so would be to make perhaps the greatest public benefaction that could be made, and it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that economic advantage might be derived from manufacturing in the area from which the semi-finished material is drawn and in a factory from which the finished article can be shipped direct. It is, at any rate, earnestly recommended that the suggestion should be explored ; unless something of the kind can be done, the ultimate future of the employable population of Sunder-land must remain a matter of most serious anxiety.39. It is not possible to conclude this section of the report without laying special stress upon the fact that any increase in employment which might follow the adoption even of all of the measures which have been suggested would, in the first instance, be small. The introduction of new industries is essentially a long term policy and there should be no illusion as to the extent of any immediate advan-tages which might accrue from it.SECTION III LOCAL   GOVERNMENT40. Investigation of the question whether local government in the area is adequately performing the functions assigned to it has led to the general conclusion that, except in the case of the administration of outdoor relief in certain localities, the local authorities have not so far failed to discharge their responsibilities, in spite of the heavy burden imposed upon them by the severity and persistence of unemployment, and the additional difficulties inherent, in some cases, in the multiplicity of administrative units. The proposals which follow deal first with the possibility of increasing the efficiency of local administration on Tyneside, and secondly with a means of overcoming the special difficulties in certain districts connected with the administration of outdoor relief.A.  Local Authorities on Tyneside41. One hundred years ago the towns and villages along the Tyne were distinct communities, to a large extent self-contained. With the growth of industry and population during the nineteenth century they have become contiguous, and with improved communications their populations have intermingled to such an extent that there is now no town along the Tyne which does not send out and receive workers, the movement taking place not only laterally on each bank of the river, but transversely as well, either by bridge or ferry at many points between Newburn and the river mouth. In fact, for practical purposes, the old boundaries have long since disappeared,
Q *? 0 (i 0 0There still exist, however, apart from the County Councils of Northumberland and Durham, thirteen local authorities on Tyne-side four County Boroughs, two Municipal Boroughs and seven Urban Districts and in hardly any of them are there to be found the conditions generally recognised as necessary to a properly balanced local government area, i.e., industries, shops and residential quarters for the different classes. It is within the bounds of possi-bility for a person to live in one town, work in another, shop in a third and possibly have his children educated in a fourth.Table IV shows the area, population and rateable value of the authorities in question ; and the figures for the County Boroughs of Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, and Manchester have been added for purposes of comparison.Table V has been drawn up to indicate the multiplicity of local bodies who are responsible for the administration of various services.It wdl be observed that the thirteen local authorities already referred to possess an aggregate acreage of 55,710, a population (1931 census) of 816,427, and a rateable value of  4,634,789, and that the same public services now supplied by a single authority in Liverpool or Manchester to approximately the same population are administered on Tyneside by a number of different bodies, which varies from four in the case of Mental Diseases to ten for Elementary Education and eleven for Maternity and Child Welfare.42. The division of industrial Tyneside into so many separate local government areas has many objections.   The interests and the problems of the area, apart from its physical unity, are in many respects so homogeneous that the present system must constitute a serious obstacle to the execution of major projects which would benefit ad concerned.   Three instances are cited as illustrations :-(1) When the Coast Road, of which only a few hundred yards are in Newcastle, was made from Newcastle to Tynemouth, the utmost difficulty was experienced in obtaining the co-operation of the Borough of Wallsend ;  and when the Corporation of Newcastle promoted a Bill for the extension of their tramway system into the same Borough, opposition was only averted by the giving of a definite undertaking that the extensibn of the Newcastle trams into Wallsend would never be used as an argument for the incorporation of the Borough with the City. (2) In order to avoid furnishing any arguments for incorporation   . with Newcastle, the Urban Districts of Gosforth and Long-benton have both expended unnecessarily large sums of money in providing sewers in such a way as to avoid draining into the city of Newcastle. The sewage from part of Gosforth, the natural drainage of which is through Newcastle, is pumped to a height of about ninety feet over a watershed.(14606 C) e
(3) At the present moment the County Boroughs of Newcastle and Tynemouth are both considering the acquisition of suitable sites for municipal aerodromes. The site proposed for Tynemouth appears to be nearer and more con-veniently placed for Newcastle than the site which the latter is considering. It is questionable, even from the most optimistic view of the future possibilities of air trans-port, whether they will both be required to serve cities separated by less than ten miles.43. The tendency for large masses of the population to become segregated into cities of the poor and the rich is a definite feature of Tyneside. Newburn and Wallsend on the north bank, and Blaydon, Gateshead, Felling, Hebburn and Jarrow on the south bank, are inhabited almost entirely by persons of small means, whilst Gosforth is essentially a residential centre for people with a more sub-stantial income. A recent census showed that out of a population of some 24,000 in Hebburn there were less than 50 persons who belonged to the employing class ; and there were no professional men, except the doctors and clergymen whose work more or less compelled them to reside in the town. It is hardly necessary to point out that the result is an uneven and most inequitable distribution of the resources of the area, and of the cost of public services.Table VI is designed to illustrate this great disparity in the rateable value per head of population, in the incidence of the rate burden and more particularly in the percentage of it required for Public Assistance. It will be observed that while the Block Grant has afforded material relief, the poundage rate in Jarrow is still 17s. 9d., while that of Gosforth is only 9s. 6d. and of Longbenton 8s.44. Moreover, the present situation constitutes a formidable obstacle to Town and Regional Planning, both of which are urgently required for the rehabilitation of the area. Spasmodic efforts have been made in this direction during the past few years and there are in existence separate regional planning schemes for both banks of the Tyne. The preparation of a single plan, which would appear to be essential if the best results are to be obtained, is in present circumstances quite impossible.45. Again, the amalgamation of the riparian authorities might be found to provide an opportunity for reviewing the present ownership of the various public docks and quays.The Tyne Improvement Commission at present exercises juris-diction over the waterway for nineteen miles inland from the sea-ward ends of the Tyne piers. In addition to providing moorings for the accommodation of vessels frequenting the port, the Commissioners own two wet docks, the Albert Edward and the Northumberland Docks on the north bank between North Shields and Howdon.
A third wet dock, Tyne Dock, on the south bank between Jarrow and South Shields belongs to the L. &amp; N.E. Railway. Four of the eleven public quays are owned by Newcastle, one by Gateshead, and two each by South Shields, Tynemouth, and Wallsend. It is at least worth consideration whether the interests of Tyneside would not be better served by the transference of all these undertakings to a single Port Authority.46. There is finally the fact, to which attention has already been drawn, that under the present system the real size and importance of the area as a market is artificially obscured ; from the point of view of establishing a new business there is all the difference in the world between the aspect of Newcastle as a County Borough with a population of 283,000, and of Tyneside as a whole with 816,000 inhabitants.47. No attempt has been made to examine in detail the financial effects of any measure of unification, and it is recognised that the simple arithmetical calculation which shows that a uniform rate of between 11s. and 12s. in the pound would have been required to meet the total expenditure in these areas for the year 1932-1933 affords no real basis for an estimate.48. That there is at any rate a strong prima facie case for some measure of unification of the local authorities on Tyneside appears to be undeniable ; and it is equally clear that the prospects of voluntary amalgamation are so remote as to be outside the realm of practical politics.The whole question of compulsory amalgamation, both in regard to scope and method, is extremely complex ; and it is not improbable that a committee of experts or a Royal Commission would be required to provide an opinion sufficiently authoritative upon which to base the special legislation which would apparently be reqiured. Any suggestion of amalgamation will arouse strong local opposition ; but the force of such opposition would be much lessened if it were decided to grant, even temporarily, some measure of financial relief to the burden of Public Assistance. Such a grant would provide an exceptional opportunity for undertaking what appears to be a necessary reform. In any case it is strongly recom-mended that the question of amalgamation should be given immediate consideration.B.  Outdoor Relief(1) County Durham.49. For the year 1933-1934 the cost of Public Assistance in the administrative County of Durham was  1,223,169 net, which, even after deduction of the Special Distressed Areas Grant, represented a rate of 8s. Q\d. in the pound, as against 8s. 5d. required for all(14606 C) e2
other General County Purposes. This figure compares with an average of 2s. 81^. for England and Wales for the year ending 31st March, 1932, the latest year for which figures are available.Eighty per cent, of the money disbursed for Public Assistance was expended upon outdoor relief able-bodied and ordinary. Although the Unemployment Assistance Board will shortly become responsible for able-bodied relief, Durham County Council will still have to make to the Board an annual contribution under this head which is estimated at  50,000, and the cost of ordinary relief, estimated at  840,000 for the current year, will still remain a charge upon the local rates.  S90,000 in terms of rates is approximately 6s. in the pound. The average rate under this head for England and Wales was Is. 1 \d. in 1932, the latest year for which information is available, but this figure includes the cost of able-bodied relief and for purposes of a strict comparison should be still further reduced.50. The position may be further illustrated by the fact that Durham has 73 persons per 1,000 on Public Assistance, compared with an average of 25-4 for the Administrative Counties of England and Wales. The burden to be borne in respect of outdoor relief is, therefore, sufficiently formidable in itself ; but when it is realised that only 3 per cent, of the dwelling houses in the County have a rateable value exceeding  20 and that 76A- per cent, are rated at  10 or under, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that this burden constitutes an almost insurmountable barrier to economic recovery.51. The remedy which would achieve the best results and for which the case in equity would appear to be unassailable, would be to grant from the Exchequer such further relief as would reduce the cost of Public Assistance still falling upon the rates to the average level obtaining throughout the country. It is recognised that such a step would raise complex questions of wide implication, and would involve an annual subsidy which upon present figures must be estimated at over  700,000. It is confidently believed, however, that considerable economies could be effected.52. The present administration of outdoor relief is considered by the Ministry of Health to be unduly extravagant and by no means free from abuse. The scales of relief are among the highest in the country and for certain classes of recipients are held to be excessive.Circumstances peculiar to the County add to the difficulties always inherent in this particular service. In the first place, the large pro-portion of people who live rent free in colliery houses, upon which the colliery owners also pay the rates, can hardly be expected to concern themselves with the expenditure of the County Council, except as potential beneficiaries. Secondly, intensive industrialisation followed by prolonged depression has left the county without its proper share of people of independent means, with the result that
the members of Relief Committees are drawn in many cases ex-clusively from the same walk of life as the applicants for relief, and find themselves confronted with the invidious task of adjudicating upon the claims of relatives, friends and neighbours. It cannot, moreover, be overlooked that in view of the large proportion of local government electors who may be applicants for Public Assistance, the Relief Committees are subjected to an additional temptation which might at any time become irresistible.These considerations have been stressed in order to explain the difficulties of a situation which appears in this County to have out-grown the capacity of the ordinary mechanism of Public Assistance.It must, accordingly, be recognised that most of the factors which compelled the Government to appoint Commissioners to administer Transitional Payments are operating as regards the administration of outdoor relief.53. Upon considerations of efficiency alone, there appears, therefore, to be a strong case for appointing Commissioners to take over the administration of ordinary outdoor relief in the Administra-tive County of Durham, in spite of the fact that special legislation would be required. If the proposal for a subsidy be accepted, the case would be still further strengthened by the introduction of the well-recognised principle that central funds must be centrally administered. The amount of the resulting economy must necessarily be hypothetical, but there is reason to suppose that it would be substantial. The practical results of the administration of Transi-tional Payments by Sir William Goodchild and his colleagues deserve close attention ; the saving of  300,000 per annum which they have effected, has been due not to the withholding of adequate payments from the deserving, but to the exclusion of those who were not properly within the scope of the scheme. Both I and my staff have formed a very definite impression, corroborated by the Employment Exchange Managers in the districts affected, that the people are actually more contented under the present system, very humanly preferring to receive strict justice rather than to run any risk of seeing their neighbours get more favourable treatment than them-s elves.Moreover, the relief afforded by the proposed subsidy would in all probability counteract the opposition which the partial supersession of the local Public Assistance Committee would otherwise arouse ; and both measures together would give an immediate and valuable stimulus towards the restoration of both the industrial and political health of the area.It is, therefore, recommended that the local rates should, by means of a further Exchequer Grant, be relieved of the amount by which the cost of Public Assistance now exceeds the average cost throughout the country, and that Commissioners be appointed by the Govern-ment to take over the administration of ordinary outdoor relief.
(2) Sunderland and West Hartlepool.54. Excluded as it is from the probable benefits of any unification of local authorities on Tyneside, as well as from any substantial share in a trade revival in that area, Sundeiiand as a County Borough would, in default of special arrangements, be outside the scope of the relief proposed for Durham County.Although the net cost of Public Assistance in Sunderland is at present at the rate of 5s. 8d. in the pound, and is thus considerably lower than that of the former authority, it is recommended that in view of the special circumstances, including the prospect that the burden may become heavier in the future, the same measure of financial relief as has been proposed for the administrative County of Durham should be applied to the County Borough of Sunderland.Careful consideration has been given to the advisability of linking this proposal with the appointment of Commissioners : and it is suggested that, at any rate for the present, the administration of ordinary relief should be left in the hands of the Local Authority.55. The case of the Hartlepools also presen ts particular difficulties : it is complicated by the fact that, although the two towns are con-tiguous,West Hartlepool is a County Borough, while Public Assistance in Hartlepool is administered by the Durham County Council.It is difficult to find any reasonable grounds why the two towns should not be amalgamated under one authority ; but since Hartle-pool will benefit under the proposals already made for relieving the administrative County of Durham of a substantial part of the financial burden of ordinary relief, it would be quite impossible to omit West Hartlepool from their scope.It is therefore recommended that the County Borough of West Hartlepool should receive the same treatment as Sunderland.SECTION IVINDUSTRIAL TRANSFERENCE56. It has already been made clear that the employable population of the area is considerably in excess of any labour requirements which can, upon the most optimistic estimate, be foreseen. Prima facie, industrial transference appears to be the simplest and most immc-diately practicable remedy ; and the fact that between 1921 and 1931 there was an outward balance of migration from County Durham of 148,000 persons shows that when work is available else-where the inhabitants of this area are willing to seek it. Unfortunately, however, the extent to which this policy would be effective in reducing unemployment in Durham and Tyneside does not depend solely upon the energy with which it is carried out, nor upon the financial assistance which is made available.
The Government found it necessary in 1932 to curtail their activities in this direction, on the ground that unemployment had so much increased throughout the country that any attempt to distinguish between the various centres of recruitment would meet with opposition: and although matters have improved in this respect and it appears that opportunities for transference, particularly of juveniles, now exist, the limiting factor must continue to be the capacity of the more fortunate districts to absorb workers from depressed areas without arousing local hostility.There are, moreover, internal obstacles to anything more than a partial solution of the problem by this means. Apart from the fact that many of the best and most easily transferable of the unemployed have already moved, the experience of the Industrial Transference Board has shown that it is very difficult to transfer men more than 35 years old, especially if they have family responsibilities ; and unfortunately over 67,000 of the unemployed in this area are over that age, and of these more than 52,000 are married.These considerations make it all the more necessary to ensure that the fuUest possible advantage should be taken of the opportunities for transference which now exist or may offer themselves in the future.57. If the most is to be made of these opportunities, it would be advisable that efforts should be concentrated upon males under the age of 35. In the first place, they are the easiest to deal with ; secondly, it appears important that those with the longest prospective industrial life should be placed in the main stream of employment; and thirdly, if they remain in Durham and Tyneside, they will in fact deprive the older men of most of their chances of local employment. To the objection that this will operate as a handicap upon the indus-trial revival of the area by depriving employers of their most adaptable source of labour, two answers can be made : first, that the process will probably be too slow to affect seriously the local suppfy of young adult labour for many years to come ; and secondly, that if the general good of the area is the end in view, it is most important that the older men, for whom transference is not possible, should have as good local opportunities as can be afforded them.With regard to the men between 18 and 35, it is unfortunately true that over 50 per cent, of those now unemployed have been out of work for more than 12 months, and although transference should not be made conditional upon a training or reconditioning course, it is extremely important that as many of them as possible should be made fit and ready to take chances when they come.58. The policy pursued at the Government Training Centres appears to be fundamentally sound. Certain considerations, connected with administration have, however, been brought to light and it is proposed to refer these direct to the Minister of Labour.
59. The Government Instructional Centres present a different problem. They were originally instituted in order to recondition men for employment upon the Public Relief Works which were being carried out at the time ; but since that policy was abandoned, they have not shown a very striking record of success in promoting transference to permanent work. Indeed, over the whole period of their existence, including the time when Public Relief Works were in being, under 50 per cent, of those who have passed through them have found employment.Of this percentage the largest proportion have passed through the camp at Carshalton, which, owing to its proximity to a large labour demand area, is much more favourably situated than camps at places like Hamsterley or Kielder. From these latter most of the men return after the course to the same existence from which they came, and soon lose the fitness for work which the course has given them. The question, therefore, to be decided in regard to them is whether the moral and physical benefit of even a short period of healthy work in good conditions justifies the cost involved. Probably the answer should be that, unless public works are started on a large scale in the area in which case they will serve a most useful purpose  these camps should only continue so long as the main work upon which the men in them are engaged is actually required in the public interest, as is at present the case at Hamsterley and Kielder.60. That the transfer of juveniles is a most urgent problem is demon-demonstrated by the increase of juvenile crime and by the evidences of malnutrition recently brought to light by enquiries ordered by the Minister of Health. An interim report has already been submitted (reproduced as Appendix 2) in regard to the machinery for moving juvenile labour ; and, here again, it is thought advisable to exclude from this report detailed recommendations which are of purely departmental concern.61. There is, however, one point of wider application. I believe that it would be an advantage to determine the present arrangement whereby certain local Education Authorities exercise powers under Section 107 of the Education Act, 1921, and Section 6 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1923, and to concentrate in the hands of the Ministry of Labour the whole responsibility for placing juveniles in employment.62. Perhaps the most encouraging feature of the local situation is the success which has attended the transfer of girls to domestic service outside the area. Of the 9,807 girls trained at the Domestic Training Centres under the Ministry of Labour, only 1-9 per cent, are still registered as unemployed. In addition, large numbers of girls already experienced in domestic service have been transferred to situations in other districts through the agency of the Employment Exchanges ; and Mrs. Headlam has also been successful in placing
approximately 7,000 girls and women in domestic employment  a result which reflects immense credit upon the organisation which she has set up. Durham girls have now acquired such an excellent reputation as domestic servants that the demand exceeds the supply, and in some villages it has been found that almost every girl over the age of 15 has left the village and found employment elsewhere.63. The necessity for removing all financial obstacles which at present hamper the steady process of transference seems, therefore, to require no further demonstration. Compared with the cost of settling an unemployed man on the land, of finding him work upon a relief scheme of an unproductive character, or even of maintaining him upon Transitional Payments with all the moral disadvantages that this entails, it would appear that expenditure upon Industrial Trans-ference up to the full extent to which this policy can be pursued is a very sound investment.64. The Under Secretary of State for the Dominions has been good enough to give me some information regarding the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Migration which will shortly be published. The opinion of that Committee that the adoption of their recommendations will secure that, when economic conditions permit of the revival of overseas migration, every suitable person who desires to migrate from this country will be able to do so, is most encouraging; and his view that a protracted period of unemploy-ment is the worst possible preparation for overseas settlement admits of no contradiction.It is recognised that large schemes of group settlement are out of the question at present, and that overseas migration can no longer be relied upon as an element in any scheme for the immediate relief of unemployment.It is, however, desired to lay particular stress upon the advantage of obtaining migration facdities for boys between the ages of 15 and 18 years, and upon the value of the earliest possible information of any prospects in this direction, in order that preparations for recruitment can be made.
SECTION V EMPLOYMENT ON THE LAND65. No comprehensive survey of the condition of the Durham coal-field can avoid the conclusion that the ultimate destiny of a large part of the county, now industrialised, must be to return to agriculture. Centres of population which have grown up round a pit head from which no coal will again be won can now only be distinguished by their slag heaps, their disproportionate size and their atmosphere of depression from the ordinary village in an agricultural district. The most optimistic forecast could hardly anticipate the possibility that new industries, capable of employing even a reasonable proportion of the inhabitants, could be established in such com-munities ; and when the admitted facts of a reduced export market for coal and a steady substitution of machinery for manual labour are taken into account, it becomes more than ever apparent that, unless the land can be made to support a larger population, many of those who would normally have been attached to the coalmining industry will be condemned to a permanent state of pauperisation.66. The rapid process of industrialisation and the subsequent decline have resulted in a not unnatural deterioration in the use of the land. It was perhaps inevitable that the former should tend to absentee landlordism, and that as the profits from the minerals increased, the importance of the surface should diminish. In many cases, in order to save themselves from vexatious claims for sub-sidence damages, the colliery companies bought up the surface and let it at less than the economic rent. The neglect of open and field drainage was a natural result of such conditions and, now the depression has come, it is improbable that it will be remedied.There is, therefore, ample scope for a more intensive use of the existing agricultural land, but the extent to which this use can be multiplied and so have a substantial effect upon employment must depend, in the first place, upon the existence of a permanent and adequate market for its produce. The Director of Agriculture for the County of Durham has furnished a memorandum which indicates that there is a substantial local demand for eggs, pork and bacon, soft fruit, vegetables and flowers, which is at present very largely met from extraneous sources. An enquiry into the markets of Northumberland and Durham, conducted by a student of Armstrong College, of which the author&apos;s kindness allowed a perusal, definitely supports this view, which is also borne out by a survey of the agri-cultural possibilities of the area made for the Tyneside Council of Social Service in 1927 by the local Inspector of the Ministry of Agriculture. Even, however, if the contention is accepted as estab-lished, it must be recognised that the reorganisation of agriculture which is now being carried out has not gone far enough to allow precise forecasts to be made of the potentialities of the home market in general.
67. In these circumstances it becomes necessary to consider in the first instance whether a scheme can be devised under which the more intensive use of the land can be made to provide healthy occupation and additional food of a wholesome kind for the unemployed, without entering them as competitors in the commercial market.68. Afforestation is sometimes regarded as affording large possibilities in this direction, but enquiries make it quite clear that the present schemes of the Forestry Commission have reached the limit of absorption of small-holders, and that they are finding it difficult to provide the required number of days&apos; work each year even for those already settled ; the number of men that can be settled is very small in proportion to the acreage of each scheme, so that, as local labour must of necessity have the preference, enormous additional acreages of afforestation would be required if substantial numbers are to be withdrawn from derelict towns and villages. It is encouraging, however, to hear that the majority of men selected from depressed areas are making good on the forestry smadholdings.69. Another scheme, more far-reaching in character, was suggested as a result of land settlement experiments in the Cleveland district of Yorkshire. Major J. B. Pennyman has there arranged for the breaking up and cultivation of unutilised land by unemployed men ; and he, as well as the men concerned, holds the view that the posses-sion of an acre of land could be combined with short-time working to provide a satisfactory level of subsistence. The difficulty of arranging for organised short-time work on a large scale in the industries of Durham and Tyneside must, however, be admitted to be great; and it is not encouraging to learn that the combination of industrial and agricultural work which was to be attempted at the farm attached to the Ford Motor Works at Dagenham has already been found impracticable.70. The experiments now being undertaken by the Agricultural Committee of the Durham County Councd appear to offer better prospects.A number of small training centres have been started with groups of 20 men upon a 5-acre plot; each group is supplied with one model set of poultry equipment and the materials for making 19 others ; each man is given 50 day-old chicks ; the feeding stuffs are bought co-operatively ; less than half of each plot is required for the poultry, and the remainder is cultivated with vegetables.The men are supervised by the County Poultry Instructor and continue to receive Transitional Payments without deduction. It is not too much to say that, apart from the physical benefits of regular work, the prospect of future independence has completely remade those who have been so fortunate as to be included in the schemes.
It is proposed to move the best of these men on to larger holdings (four men have,&apos; through the generosity of the Society of Friends, recently been placed as an experiment upon a 20-acre holding at Sacriston), and to aim at providing a means by which those who show the necessary aptitude and energy can eventually become self-supporting.From the practical point of view development along these lines appears to be the most suitable to the particular conditions of the area. In the first place it does not require the building of new houses, which is the principal expense in land settlement; under most small-holding schemes, this outlay must be undertaken at the start, but here the men are put on to plots within reach of their own homes. Secondly, it provides for a practical method of selecting the men most likely to make good if launched upon an attempt to be self-supporting. Thirdly, during the initial period the men have the benefit of expert advice and supervision. And finally, the method will not involve immediate settlement on a large scale, with a com-mensurate increase in production for the market; it will on the contrary be a gradual process, capable of being accelerated or retarded according to the results obtained, and providing in the first stage occupation and partial subsistence, and at the same time a ladder by which the unemployed man can climb right back not only to making a living, but eventually to making a good one, if he uses; intelligently the capital which he will after a time begin to accumulate.In order that this scheme should be possible, it will be necessary:  (1) to provide the capital for setting up the communal centres. A 5-acre centre for 20 men costs  185 to set up, or  9-5 per man, and at present each man repays in the second or third year half of this sum. (2) to provide the capital required to set up groups of 4 selected men upon a holding of about 20 acres. It is very roughly estimated that  150 will be needed per man, and of this sum he should be required to repay two-thirds by instalments.(3) to arrange that Transitional Payments should continue without question to the men on the quarter-acre plots, and to the men on the 4-5-acre holdings until the land is in full production.(4) to provide a substantial proportion of the loss arising out of the acquisition of the land and re-letting ; at present 75 per cent, of such loss would be payable by the Ministry of Agriculture under the Small Holdings Acts, and the proportion would probably have to be increased in order to encourage any large extension of the present scheme. 71. Several general considerations need to be emphasised. The unemployed in Durham undoubtedly show a particular liking and
aptitude for work on the land, and even for those who never succeed in getting beyond the initial stages the scheme will provide at very small cost the kind of occupation which is best calculated to promote their well-being. If it should ultimately succeed in adding very materially to the agricultural production of the county, it may well enable canning factories to be set up on Tyneside or at Sunderland, which will assist in solving the unemployment problem. Indeed, the possibility of establishing canning factories for such commodities as peas and soft fruits, and in particular of setting up a bacon factory, might profitably be investigated at once. Such factories would provide exactly what is wanted to encourage production in the area and to stabdise the market for the producer.Although the capital for the initiation of land settlement schemes has in many cases been provided by philanthropic effort in the past, such sources will not suffice for expansion upon an adequate scale; it is, however, strongly urged that the provision of funds from the Exchequer should not be allowed to result in too rigid an administra-tion of land settlement schemes, which require great flexibility in their adjustment to local and individual needs.It has been urged that market gardening provides the greatest volume of employment per acre and that unemployed men would have greater security if they could be engaged as wage-earners in large market gardens under experienced management. It is true that there is land in Durham, the Wear valley for instance, which appears to be well suited for such cultivation; but it does not seem so certain, upon a long view, that this policy would be in the best interests of the area. If it is right to proceed with caution in regard to land settlement as a whole, then a policy which at once induces intensive competition in existing markets must be open to serious objection.Moreover, a visit to any one of the schemes in existence, or to some of the successful large allotments and small holdings worked up by unemployed men out of their own unaided resources cannot fail to leave the visitor with a preference for the individual method which has produced such excellent results. The development of market gardening by private enterprise would, however, be a valuable adjunct to other schemes, and such a development might well result from the establishment of canning factories in the area.72. Finally, as an immediate means of providing a limited amount of employment and at the same time effecting a permanent and much needed improvement in the productive capacity of the land, it is recommended that financial assistance should be given to the Durham County Council to enable it to carry out a number of open drainage works, in areas where they already possess the right to do so. These works are urgently needed : they relate to a number of different localities and would therefore provide employment in scattered villages, many of which are among the most depressed : and they are at present held up for lack of financial resources.
SECTION vi the RESIDUAL PROBLEM73. The Outline Instructions to the Investigators made it clear that &quot; since any remedial measures will take time to put into operation it is important that there should be evidence of interest in the unemployed population, and that they should be made to feel that there is something for them to do other than sitting or standing about.&quot;The conclusion to which all that has so far been written inevitably leads is that a considerable, though indeterminate, surplus of workers will exist in the area for some time to come.This surplus of workers will be composed to a considerable extent of the older men with family responsibilities, who, being less easily movable, will not come within the scope of any transference scheme, at least in its early stages, and are not likely to be the first to be given any opportunities for industrial employment that may result from a trade revival in the area.The proposals hitherto adumbrated for dealing with them, with the exception of Industrial Transference which should begin at the earliest possible moment, are in the nature of long term policies from which no visible benefits can be expected this winter.The general condition of the people, in spite of the slight improve-ment in the employment returns during the past few months, must be regarded as undergoing a process of progressive deterioration.It is, therefore, very necessary that other proposals of immediate application should reinforce the slower, if more permanent, ameliorative-tive measures.A.  Public Work Schemes74. The Durham County Council has submitted for consideration a number of schemes which, apart from their possible value to the community, are designed to give additional employment. These schemes, with others put forward by the various local authorities in Durham and on Tyneside or suggested from unofficial sources, have been carefully examined in the light of the experience obtained under the previous administration, and having regard also to the general policy of the present Government. Most of them must be rejected on the grounds that their capital cost is out of proportion to the amount of employment they can provide, and that they do not ensure a return, in revenue or in capital appreciation, at all commensurate with the extra burden which they will impose upon the Exchequer or the rates.75. Of those that remain after this test has been applied, what is known as the Jarrow Slake Scheme may be taken first for considera-tion. This proposal has already been submitted to the Govern -ment by the Tyne Improvement Commission with a request for a
2grant-in-aid, and is one which would appear to be well designed to bring to the Tyne trade of a kind for which it has not yet been able to provide facilities. It is understood that the Secretary of the Commission has already received assurances from certain shipping companies that if the scheme were carried out they would send to the Tyne some of their large ships, passenger and freight, for which there has hitherto been no sufficient accommodation. The principal merits of the scheme are that it will provide facilities for shipping of larger tonnage than has hitherto been catered for on the river ; and, secondly, that its execution wiU provide employment for the neighbouring population of Jarrow, of whom over 50 per cent, are at present out of work. The chief obstacle to its adoption appears to be that the Tyne Improvement Commission and the L.N.E. Railway Company, whose Tyne dock must be acquired by the Commission before work can begin, have not been able to reach agreement as to the price that should be paid for the dock. In view of the necessity and the difficulty of finding work of a productive kind as soon as possible for the unemployed of Tyneside, it is strongly recommended that the Government should interest itself in these negotiations with the object of bringing them to an early conclusion. The questions whether a grant should be made and whether the full scheme or the modified alternative plan should be adopted would still remain for decision ; such information as has been collected seems to indicate that the case for the scheme is a good one and should at least be given the most careful consideration.76. Another scheme of public work proposed for the Tyneside area, which appears upon a preliminary investigation to be likely to bring a return in the shape of increased prosperity, is that for a tunnel under the river close to its mouth, which will link up the towns on either bank and provide direct access to the North from Sunderland. A scheme has been prepared for the construction of such a tunnel at an estimated cost of  1,300,000, and the advantages of improved cross-river communication at this point are undoubted.In view of the amount of unemployment prevading, particularly in Sunderland, it would be unfortunate if consideration of this proposal were delayed until a decision had been taken in regard to the unification of local authorities in the area. Only the two County Boroughs of South Shields and Tynemouth would be concerned in the cost, and the scheme seems eminently one to which the Govern-ment might consider giving financial aid.77. The next measure to which consideration must be given is the clearance of the derelict factory sites on Tyneside, to which previous reference has been made. The most outstanding example is that of Palmer&apos;s shipbudding yard at Jarrow ; if, as seems inevitable, there is no possibdity that it can be used even for ship-repairing, the adaptation of the site to some other form of production is a matter of urgent importance.   The yard is shortly to be put up to
public auction, but if the enormous expense of removing the plant should prove an insuperable obstacle to a sale, it is recommended that the site should be acquired from National Shipbuilding Securities Ltd., either by the Government itself or by the Industrial Develop-ment Company already referred to. Its clearance would provide a great deal of work for a district which has been particularly hard hit, and it is at least possible that the sale of a vacant site possessing such natural advantages might subsequently recoup the whole cost.78. The work of clearing the other derelict sites on Tyneside would be eminently suitable for unskilled labour, and although it would be difficult to claim that a definite financial return could be foreseen from the money so expended, there is little doubt that an improve-ment in the appearance of the district would go far to remove one of the main deterrents to new industrial development.79. So far as work of this kind for a Local Authority is concerned, Sec. 37 (b) of the Unemployment Act 1934 appears to meet the case : but the principal difficulty of undertaking it upon a really compre-hensive scale lies in the fact that so many of these derelict sites belong to private owners. Two&apos; solutions appear to be possible : first, the levy of a betterment rate so as to recover some part at least of the enhanced value due to clearance ; alternatively, the acquisition of the sites as suggested for Palmer&apos;s yard.80. There is a different category of work which could be under-taken at less cost, and which would be of great value in providing occupation for the permanent surplus of labour attached to the coalfield. From such enquiries as I have made I think that, what-ever the official attitude of the Trade Unions might be, many of the unemployed would be glad to accept a proposal to work for Transi-tional Payments increased by a small additional sum weekly, with working clothes and a midday meal, provided that three conditions were fulfilled.In the first place, the work must be entirely voluntary, and refusal to accept it must not disqualify a man for Transitional Payments.Secondly, it should be confined, at any rate in the first instance, to schemes where the benefit would accrue to some public authority and could not possibly be construed as putting money into the pocket of a private owner.Thirdly, the work should be of such a kind as to convince those undertaking it that it would be for the direct benefit of the community in which they live.The provision of playgrounds is the clearest example of what is indicated ; the need for them is urgent and it might perhaps be possible to obtain some financial assistance towards the cost of materials from the National Playing Fields Association, reinforced by a special appeal relating directly to the derelict areas.
This scheme would be of particular value in the Bishop Auckland area, but it is recommended that the Unemployment Assistance Board should consider giving it the widest application which the well-recognised limits to the amount of such work available will permit.B. Housing81. The proposals for Jarrow Slake and the South Shields Tunnel have been put forward as much, or more, for the permanent return in increased prosperity which they appear likely to bring, as for the contribution which they will make to the immediate solution of the residual problem ; and, although it may appear at the moment that the employment which the clearance of derelict sites and the provision of amenities will provide may be substantial, it is still necessary to look for some further source of work of a public kind, of which the operation and the results will be spread over the whole area. After a careful review of needs and conditions, the preference must un-hesitatingly be given to a comprehensive housing scheme.S2. In the first place, it would provide a substantial amount of the kind of employment which is especially required for the large number of unskilled labourers for whose services there is at present no demand. Moreover it will provide for such men, in or near the localities where they reside, work which will continue for a considerable period.S3. Secondly, the need for better housing is most pressing. It is generally accepted by the Ministry of Health that the Counties of Durham and Northumberland compare unfavourably with the rest of the country in this respect, the free colliery house system under which the colliery worker is both a tenant and an employee of the company being one definite obstacle to improvement. Houses are small and poor in type, and the precentage of overcrowding is unduly high, even compared with most of the other coalfields in Great Britain. Overcrowding results in a high birth rate and a high birth rate intensifies overcrowding. The birth rate in Durham County is well above the average of the whole country (19 per 1,000 as against 15) and the advantage of any measure that will induce a less rapid increase in the population needs no emphasis.Even on the assumption made in the Census that a room, whether living room or bedroom, is capable of accommodating two persons, there are 21,500 families in the administrative County of Durham and 25,500 on Tyneside living in overcrowded conditions.If the higher standards laid down by the Housing Act, 1930, are applied, namely that a one-roomed dwelling is totally inadequate, a two-roomed house is considered capable of accommodating two persons and a three-roomed house four persons, the figures rise to 60,000 in each case.
The slum-clearance programmes of the local authorities in the area, either settled or in course of preparation, show that there are 21,000 houses scheduled for clearance or demolition, leaving 107,000 persons to be rehoused : and an estimate of 50,000 additional houses required to abate overcrowding would be on the conservative side.84. In the third place, such a scheme would result in the creation of a permanent asset of substantial value and would be of lasting benefit to the health of the people; while the stimulating effect upon the general mind of the area, even of the bare announcement that it was to be put in hand, would be difficult to overestimate.S5. The objection may be raised that it is inexpedient to embark upon a large building programme in an area where many features of the prevailing depression appear to be permanent, and from which transference is to be carried out as energetically as possible. It is admitted that a steady decline in the population may be expected over the next twenty years, but the experience of the ten years between 1921 and 1931 has shown that the emigration of over 10 per cent, of the population does not suffice to balance the natural increase : and a detached investigation of the position in every centre of population has brought to light that, even after several years of severe depression and a considerable exodus, the number of empty houses is infinitesimal. Nor can it be safely argued that the present state of affairs has been stabilised, since in the course of a decade or two large numbers of the existing houses in the area will either fall below the accepted standard or will require demolition as having passed their allotted span : so that any houses built in the next few years will before long be required to meet inevitable wastage, as distinct from immediate needs.86. It seems sufficiently clear that the need for houses at rents which the lowest paid workers can afford cannot in present circum-stances be met, at any rate in this area, either by private enterprise or by aUowing the local authorities to build without a subsidy. On the other hand, no solution which would impose additional burdens on the rates can be considered practicable. If, therefore, some special housing scheme is to be adopted for the relief of unemploy-ment as wed as for its own intrinsic value, the financial gap must by some means or other be bridged by an Exchequer contribution.87. A very careful expert survey of the area would be required in order to decide the comparative needs, but it would be safe to say, even at this stage, that Tyneside should be the first to come under review, and that special and urgent consideration should be given to Sunderland because of the peculiar uncertainty of its prospects of a natural recovery in the demand for employment. If such a scheme-is undertaken by the Government, it is recognised that those authorities which have paid most attention to the improvement of housing conditions will benefit least by the State aid thus afforded.
It is considered, however, that in a matter in which the general need is so pressing and the general good so certain to be promoted, such considerations of strict justice must be disregarded.C. Social Service and Allotments88. The activities of the various organisations engaged in Social Service and in the promotion of Unemployed Welfare Schemes are of very great value in demonstrating to the unemployed man that he is not forgotten by his fellows, in providing some at least of the workless with opportunities for self expression and in supplying for all who take advantage of them a lesson in the use of leisure. It is, however, unfortunately true that these activities do not at present touch more than the extreme fringe of the problem and that, even if they were to be greatly increased by the multiplication of financial resources, they could not supply the place of industrial employment with the regular hours of work which are essential to the well-being of the unemployed, and the status to which every self-respecting member of the community attaches such importance. It is in fact impossible to avoid the conclusion that, apart from industrial employ-ment, occupation upon the land is the only way of meeting this requirement; and if it were practicable to supply every unemployed man with an allotment, I would recommend this as the best method of restoring his moral and physical health. Unfortunately, although in the mining villages of Durham County it might be practicable to furnish a very large percentage of the unemployed with land upon which to work, this is not the case in built-up areas.89. Finally, it is recommended that particular attention should be given to the scheme which is now being undertaken at Upholland, near Wigan, under the direction of Mr. Peter Scott; if, as seems probable, this method of assisting isolated communities where prospects of participation in any general recovery are particularly remote, to become at least partially independent of assistance from public funds, is considered to be justified, the really derelict villages in the Durham coalfield offer an ideal place for its application on a wider scale.
......SECTION VIIGENERAL CONCLUSIONS A. The Case for Government Intervention90. On 4th June, 1934, 16-1 per cent, of the insured population of Great Britain were on the live register ; on the same date the figure for Tyneside and Durham was 27-2, for the Bishop Auckland Employment Exchange area 50-4, and for Jarrow 56-8.The cause of-this disproportion, stated in the simplest terms, is the radical alteration in economic conditions, both internal and international, which has occurred since the War ; old fields of activity have been rendered unprofitable and industrialists have been compelled to seek new ones in which, for one reason or another, prospects are more favourable.Our prosperity was built up on a system which depended prin-cipally for its successful operation upon the ability of this country to find continually expanding markets overseas.Unfortunately, however, markets abroad have not only ceased to expand, but there are indications that the present contraction may continue for some time, and overseas trade, at any rate with foreign countries, finally be stabilised upon a lower level.For many years past the capacity of some overseas countries to absorb British exports has been stimulated by the investment in them of a substantial proportion of our favourable balance of inter-national payments. It is at least open to question whether any country can continue indefinitely to support the adverse balance which appears to be the inevitable corollary of this system. The theory that overseas investment will provide an unceasing outlet for the growing industrial activity made possible by modern invention can, therefore, no longer be accepted as axiomatic ; and the in-escapable consequence seems to be that this country will eventually be obliged to content itself with a balanced foreign trading account, somewhat upon the lines now advocated by the London Chamber of Commerce.If, therefore, it be admitted that the industrial depression and the heavy unemployment in this area are due to causes outside the control of those who reside in it, it is equally true to say there is no likelihood that the same forces which have created the present situation will automatically readjust it, except after a lapse of time and at a cost of human suffering and economic waste which no modern Government would care to contemplate. Durham and Tyneside can only escape from the vicious circle, where high rates create unemployment and unemployment higher rates, by means of some positive external assistance.
91. Consideration of the form which such assistance should take inevitably raises questions of general policy, which might at first sight appear to be outside the scope of this Report. But, just as the really derelict towns and villages cannot be dealt with in isolation, so it is impossible to promote effective measures for the rehabilitation of any one area without reference to the country as a whole.(1) The first of these questions is the attitude of the Government towards the location of industry. Any large scale movement of population involves an immense waste of social capital. Not only have houses, schools, roads, sewers, hospitals, etc., to be built in the newly settled area, but there must always remain a residue of persons who cannot be transplanted and must therefore become a charge upon public funds.The most outstanding example of the movement of population to a new area is the industrialisation and consequent rapid growth of greater London. The evils, actual and potential, of this increasing agglomeration of human beings are so generally recognised as to need no comment.It is suggested, therefore, that the time has come when the Govern-ment can no longer regard with indifference a line of development which, while it may possess the initial advantage of providing more employment, appears upon a long view to be detrimental to the best interests of the country ; and the first practical step which could be taken towards exercising a measure of control in this direction would seem to be some form of national planning of industry.(2) The problem of juvenile unemployment is particularly acute in this area : it is estimated that over 16,000 male juveniles will, in default of special measures, be surplus to requirements by the end of this year: and that idleness during adolescence is peculiarly demoralising admits of no doubt.Whatever the difficulties and disadvantages of raising the school age, it would not have been possible, from the point of view of Durham and Tyneside, to avoid urging such a course upon the Government had it not been for the Unemployment Insurance Act 1934. Provided that the measures for dealing with juveniles under that Act are really comprehensive, and that financial considera-tions are not allowed to stand in the way of securing that every juvenile who cannot find work is adequately cared for, the more contentious and expensive proposal may prove unnecessary.(3) The proposals which have been made for the employment of more persons upon the land are extremely limited in scope, and represent only a very small fraction of an ultimate development which I believe not only to be wise but inevitable.
The efforts being made by the Government to restore agriculture, in all its branches, to a much more important place in our national economic structure must necessarily take time : and it seems only prudent that special measures for placing a large number of persons in an industry which, in present circumstances, can only be made self-supporting by substantial grants from the Exchequer and with the assistance of special legislation, should proceed fiari passu with the rehabilitation of agriculture as a whole. There is, in my view, immense scope for land drainage, small holdings and market gardening, as and when the reorganisation of our national market permits.(4) Consideration of the possibilities of finding work for a sub-stantial proportion of the 160,000 persons now unemployed in this area inevitably raises the question of the absorptive capacity of the labour market throughout the country. It is clear that this capacity has been materiady affected by the invasion of women into the industrial field and particularly into the distributive and miscel-laneous trade groups, which at present show the greatest capacity for expansion.The employment of juveniles also &quot;reacts upon the labour market, and it would appear necessary, having regard to present conditions and future prospects, to consider seriously some limitation of the fields of female and juvenile labour, except in cases where the absolute existence of an export industry depends upon it.(5) The difficulties of any pension scheme which would ensure elimination from the industrial field even at the age of 65 are admittedly immense ; but if it can be demonstrated that there is not sufficient employment for all those who seek it, some proposal of this kind may deserve a further examination.(6) Finally, the general reduction of hours, or the introduction of a 5-day week however remote their prospects may appear today  cannot be omitted from the picture.C. Practical Application92. I recognise that many of my recommendations raise issues which may prove embarrassing, and that it would not be difficult to discard each one individually upon grounds which in ordinary circumstances might be considered conclusive. The facts, however, remain that the situation to be dealt with is extraordinary, and that if there had existed any alternative plan less open to objection, it would long since have been put forward and the present investigation would have been unnecessary.93. It is abundantly clear that there is no single solution of the unemployment problem of Durham and Tyneside ; ameliorative action must proceed along a number of parallel or convergent lines.
To schedule particular spots in the area for special treatment is not, for the reasons given in the opening section of this report, a practical proposal: to place the whole of Durham and Tyneside under some form of special &quot; Derelict Area Administration &quot; would, in my view, do more harm than good, even if such a plan could be considered feasible.The recommendations submitted affect different departments of the Government, and their application must vary both in method and degree within the whole area covered by this Report.Day to day decisions, based more upon intimate local knowledge than upon the strict interpretation of some general code, will be required if the task of rehabilitating the derelict towns and villages is to be energetically undertaken, and appreciable results achieved at the earliest moment.It seems essential therefore that some authority, either a very small Board or a single Commissioner, should be set up to direct and co-ordinate the work locally, without the necessity of referring any but major questions to London.Without some machinery of this kind it appears inevitable that the achievement of tangible results must be unnecessarily delayed ; and time, as has already been pointed out, is of the essence of the contract.SECTION VIIISUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL recommendations.

APPENDIX IINTERIM REPORT No. 1General Considerations affecting Employment in existing industries. The Outline Instructions issued to the Investigators indicate four possible solutions of the unemployment problem in the derelict areas : (1) Revival of existing industries which is the simplest, since it involves the minimum of dislocation either geographical or occupational. (2) Introduction of new industries which has the great advantage of improving the industrial balance in the area. (3) More intensive use of the land which must depend for its value uponthe condition and prospects of the agricultural industry in general. (4) Transfer to other areas which can only be utilised so far as theemployment situation in the country as a whole permits.Consideration of the occupational and social needs of those who must inevitably remain outside the scope of the above must clearly be deferred until some estimate can be formed of their numbers.2. It is also quite plain from the Outline Instructions that an essential pre-liminary to the submission of any concrete proposals must be the preparation of some estimate of the number of unemployed persons who can be dealt with under each of these four heads ; and, assuming that it is desirable to restrict transference as far as possible, that employment on the land is unlikely to absorb more than a small proportion of the present population and that new industries will only be attracted to the area after remedial measures have been taken, the estimation of the prospects of a revival in the existing industries becomes the first and most important consideration.The whole future of both the coal-mining and shipbuilding (which for this purpose may be taken to include ship-repairing and marine engineering) industries depends at present so largely upon Government policy, that until certain major decisions can be taken the outlook is too obscure to permit the making of an estimate which would be of any real value, as to their possible labour requirements.Coalmining3. A preliminary examination of the coalmining position shows that the first difficulty to be faced in formulating any scheme for a revival of employ-ment is that of defining the limits of the unemployment problem. To take one specific question only, there are certain pits in the West Auckland area one of the worst areas as regards unemployment where valuable coal is now submerged, and there seems to be general agreement that the flooding which has put these pits out of action constitutes a real, if remote, danger to pits now working further to the east.But the multiplicity of ownership of royalties and the lack of real community of interests between the owners of royalties and the lessees of the mining rights, puts any question of a joint economical scheme of pumping for the whole area outside the question of practical politics as matters are at present.4. Moreover, the question of de-watering the pits now flooded inevitably raises the further question as to whether it is in the interest of the coal trade in general, or indeed in the national interest, that pits in this area should be afforded the possibility of re-opening. These West Auckland pits depend for their market upon the steel trade, and cannot enter into economical corn-petition in other coking coal markets. Lacking a marked revival in the demand from Middlesbrough, their re-opening would simply increase the stress of
uneconomic competition. And yet in the existing organisation of the coal-fields, supposing that a scheme of joint pumping at greatly reduced prices were put into operation and that the coal could be worked with possibility of profit, there is nothing to prevent these pits re-opening and re-working.Under present conditions any company which sees a possible profit in sinking a new pit in an old area or in an entirely new one, or even in acquiring an existing pit for a very low price and with reduced royalties, can start mining operations without question asked, and the cumulative effect of this policy has undoubtedly been one factor in the creation of the derelict conditions obtaining in the West Auckland area.5. From these considerations the definite conclusion seems to.emerge that the extent of the permanent unemployment problem in Durham County cannot be known until the coal trade is organised to the point of having a common policy and the means to carry out the policy. Such a policy would aim at bringing the best pits to full production and eliminating the least profitable and worst conditioned pits, so that those miners who were in employment would secure high wages and the best conditions of work, and the unemployed men previously attached to the mining industry would know that there was no work for them in coalmining and would not hang on neglecting other possibilities of employment in the hope of closed pits re-opening.Any attempt, however, to estimate the possibility in existing conditions of the re-organisation outlined above seems to lead, whatever starting point is chosen, inevitably and depressingly to the same insuperable barrier the multiplicity of ownership of royalties and the fundamental divergence whicli now exists between the interests of the royalty owners on the one hand and the lessees of mining rights on the other.A scheme for the unification of royalties appears to be an essential pre-liminary to any concerted action ; it might by itself enable such action to be taken ; but it is clear that without it nothing effective can be done.6. The draft of a scheme to deal with the water in part of the coalfield in South-West Durham has been submitted by Messrs. Dorman Long &amp; Co.; it appears from outside enquiries that it is feasible from an engineering point of view and that it would reduce the pumping costs for pits at present working and safeguard other collieries from the danger of inundation, quite apart from its possible value as a means of de-watering certain pits now closed.It does not, however, appear to be worth while having this proposal examined in detail until it is known whether the Government are prepared to consider the unification of royalties.7. The much larger question remains as to whether it is desirable that special efforts should be made to promote a revival of the coalmining industry in Durham, having regard to the general situation and prospects in the country as a whole.Looked at from the widest point of view, it would seem to be in the national interest that an existing coalfield should be worked out before new pits are opened, with all the capital expenditure upon roads, houses, schools and social services which is thereby necessitated. And it is difficult to rebut the general theory that all the coal available in Durham should be extracted before new pits are sunk elsewhere.Whichever way this question is decided, it does not appear that such decision can be enforced under present conditions, when pits may be opened and closed at the will of individual royalty owners.The unification of royalties would, therefore, even if there was no inter-ference with existing leases, at least make a start in securing that common and definite policy which can alone provide grounds for any forecast as to the future capacity of the industry to provide work.
28It is perhaps worth observing that the Chairman and Secretary of the Northumberland and Durham Coalowners declined to admit that there was any labour surplus in the County of Durham which could be regarded as permanent ; they appeared to regard with equanimity a situation in which large numbers of men and boys would be maintained at the expense of the nation as a possible labour reserve for a contingency which most people regard as extremely remote.Independent opinion does not, however, support this view, and it seems quite clear that a considerable surplus of persons, who at any rate regard themselves as attached to the coalmining industry, live in the area at present and constitute the real problem with which the Government is faced.ShipbuildingS. As regards shipbuilding, similar difficulties exist in making any estimate, which would be of the least practical value, of the numbers who may be expected to obtain work in the near future.It is generally agreed (and the industrial survey of the North-East Coast undertaken by Armstrong College bears this out) that any considerable pro-gramme of mercantile tonnage replacement would disclose an actual shortage of skilled labour on the Tyne.The possibility of such a revival appears to depend on the nature of any action which the Government may be contemplating to assist shipping.Broadly speaking, a policy of direct subsidy for tramp steamers would tend to delay a shipbuilding revival, while any scheme to encourage scrapping and rebuilding would greatly accelerate it.Shipbuilding employers appear to be sceptical as to the possibility of increasing the supply of at least partially trained men by any other means than the actual provision of work in the yards ; but if it were decided that the Government policy is to be directed towards the encouragement of new building in the near future, it would be well worth while giving special consideration to the question of additional training facilities for this class of work.EUAN WALLACE.22nd May, 1934.APPENDIX IIINTERIM REPORT No. 2 TRANSFERENCE OF JUVENILES FROM DEPRESSED areas. The problem of juvenile unemployment in this area is of such magnitude and urgency as to necessitate the adoption of any method of alleviation which is immediately available.An estimate prepared by the Divisional Office of the Ministry of Labour shows that approximately 16,600* boys alone will be surplus to requirements during the current year, 20,800 in 1935, 27,500 in 1936, and 31,500 in 1937. Thereafter the figures decline, to just below 20,000 in 1944. These are boys of ages ranging from 14 to 17 years, and, although separate statistics have not been prepared for each year of the juvenile period, it is obvious that even if the school leaving age were raised to 15, there would still be a formidable volume of boy juvenile labour for which there is no local demand.2. The effects of unemployment during the juvenile period are particularly tragic, and it is fortunate that an actual shortage of juveniles exists at present in parts of the Midlands and the South.* This figure takes into account the boys who are expected to leave school at the conclusion of the next two terms.
No time should therefore be lost in launching a scheme of transference upon the largest possible scale.3. The North-Easterri Division of the Ministry of Labour has transferred some 4,000 juveniles (boys) to the South and Midlands to date, largely by the aid of the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund, but the figures quoted above show clearly that this rate of transference will not bo effective, and that every possible step must be taken to increase it up to the full capacity of the more prosperous areas to provide vacancies. The Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund is nearly exhausted, and if the transference of juveniles is to be carried out on anything like an adequate scale it is essential that urgent consideration should be given to the question of removing the financial obstacles.4. Voluntary subscription will, in my view, be quite inadequate to deal with the problem, even if it wore considered desirable that it should do so : and on the assumption that the Government will be anxious to take advantage of the demand for juvenile labour arising from the general improvement of trade outside the depressed areas, and will accept responsibility for the expenses of juvenile transference, I have set out the principal directions in which financial assistance would appear to be most effective.(A) Payment of Maintenance of Subsistence Grants to supplement IndustrialWagesThe present practice should continue, except that the arrangement whereby employers contribute a share of this supplementary provision should cease. A good deal may be said in favour of some contribution by the employers, but there is little doubt that it has deterred many employers from making use of the scheme, and this would seem to be the over-riding consideration.Against this extra item there would be a saving in the cost of Junior Instructional Centre provision, which may be taken as about 5.9. a head per week.(B) Free Travelling Warrants to Juveniles proceeding on transfer to IndustrialEmploymentFree travelling warrants should be issued to juveniles proceeding on transfer to industrial employment or to any approved course of training. There are in this area courses of training made available by well-disposed persons outside the regular provision, and I think that if, in his discretion, the Divisional Controller is of opinion that these courses are of value, they should be brought within the general scheme and free travelling facilities provided.No reliable figures are available as to numbers of girl juveniles for whom no employment is available, as they do not always register at the Labour Exchanges. They are, however, being successfully transferred to domestic service, so far as is possible under present conditions. A considerable surplus undoubtedly exists, and the facilities proposed for boys should apply equally to both sexes.As regards girls proceeding to domestic employment at a distance, it is recognised that consideration must be given to long-established professional custom. In view, however, of the fact that some private agencies are already offering free travel as an inducement in the case of long-distance transfers, and that many of these offer no effective guarantee of the moral standing and character of the employer, I consider that similar facilities should be available for any girl sent forward to such employment from depressed areas. In many cases, no doubt, employers would, as now, be prepared to pay the cost of travelling, but the position would probably be met by allowing discretion to be exercised by Divisional Controllers in respect of each job.
(C) Provision against EmergenciesIt will be necessary to continue the provision now available against emergencies such as incidental expenses on the outward journey, occasional loss of wages through sickness or short-time working in the new employment and, where circumstances prevent the juvenile from remaining in the area, the fare home in case of need. Further, it is understood that the existing facilities for the provision of necessary clothing have on occasion come short of requirements, and should be extended.5. My recommendations on other questions which arise in the consideration of juvenile transference are :(i) Areas of Recruitment. Necessary assistance should be given forth-with in respect of all juvenile transferences from the area covered by my investigations, viz. : Tyneside and County Durham, and not merely from the areas at present scheduled as depressed, (ii) Nature of Employment. Whilst the employment should offer, as a general rule, continuity of work and progressive conditions, it is possible that the openings available in, say, Yorkshire woollen mills might not carry such a guarantee and yet offer a few months&apos; work, which in itself would be of great advantage to a juvenile who otherwise would have no work at all. Grants should be made in respect of all employment approved by the Divisional Controller in charge of the vacancy area.(iii) Method of Payment of Grant. The present method, whereby thegrant is paid direct to the juvenile concerned, is sound and should continue, as it provides safeguards in respect of after care and industrial supervision which would otherwise not be available.(iv) Accommodation. Settlement in lodgings is necessary to the effectiveassimilation of a juvenile to the new surroundings, but cases will arise where there will be a shortage of suitable accommodation to which the juvenile could be allocated immediately on his arrival. Here the provision of hostels will no doubt be essential, but they should be on the small side and in the nature of assembling centres from which the juveniles could be drafted to suitable lodgings in due course.Adoption of Depressed by Prosperous Areas6. The adoption of areas is not recommended, as it tends to fetter freedom of action ; but it is advisable that transferred juveniles from particular areas should be placed as near to each other as possible, as is the practice to a large extent.Voluntary Character of Juvenile Transference7. Whilst the problem is of its present dimensions it does not appear necessary to apply compulsion to juveniles of any age. Parents&apos; consent should be obtained in all cases.Formation of Rehabilitation CampsS. The proposal to establish camps in the vicinity of &quot; receiving &quot; areas is not regarded as sound, as parents will doubtless require to have details of the employment available before allowing juveniles to travel.Neither are camps in the derelict areas themselves considered necessary, at any rate at present. There is a danger that a course at such camps might come to be regarded as an essential preliminary to transference and that such an attitude on the part of the public would considerably delay the flow of juveniles from depressed areas.It is possible that the handicap of under-nourishment may affect transfer in due course, and that this question may need reconsideration later on.25th June, 1934.EUAN WALLACE.

 west CUMBERLANDDERELICT AREAS INVESTIGATION1. The industrial problems of West Cumberland have engaged considerable attention in the past few years. This area was not one of those selected for survey by the Government in 1931, but, following upon the publication of the reports of the industrial surveys made on behalf of the Government in Lancashire and else-where, representations were submitted from West Cumberland that the Government should undertake a survey of that area. These representations were not met by the Government, but sufficient local support was forthcoming to enable the University of Manchester (which had carried out the Lancashire Survey) to conduct an-industrial survey of West Cumberland as part of the work of the Research Section of its Department of Economics and Commerce. The report of this survey has been most valuable in the present investigation.2. The University survey did not confine itself to West Cumber-land ; it covered also the Furness district of Lancashire. The present investigation has omitted the Furness district but has included a little more of Cumberland and also, on grounds of con-venience, the town of Haltwhistle which, though over the Cumberland border in Northumberland, is attached to the North Western Division of the Employment Exchange system. These relatively small differences of area do not in any way mditate against the value of the Manchester University Survey as a background to the present investigation.3. In terms of Ministry of Labour local offices the present investigation has covered the areas of the following : -(1) Workington Exchange and the attached Branch Employ-ment Offices of Maryport, Harrington, Cockermouth andAspatria. (2) Whitehaven Exchange. (3) Cleat or Moor Exchange. (4) Millom Branch Employment Office. (5) Alston Branch Employment Office. (6) Haltwhistle Branch Employment Office.4. The first issue which arose in the present investigation was naturally to consider whether any and, if so, what towns and villages within these areas could be described as &quot; derelict.&quot;   To
reach a conclusion on this was by no means easy. In brief, the position is that in April 1934, the various Ministry of Labour areas carried the following percentages of men unemployed : Maryport Branch Employment Office . . .. 61-2Haltwhistle Branch Employment Office .. 57-3Cleator Moor Employment Exchange .. .. 52-8Cockermouth Branch Employment Office .. 45-3Alston Branch Employment Office      .. .. 41-4Aspatria Branch Employment Office ... .. 37-0Millom Branch Employment Office     .. .. 33-1Whitehaven Employment Exchange .. 32-3Workington Employment Exchange &apos;.. .. 31-7Harrington Branch Employment Office .. 2S-2(Note. -The figures for men only are quoted as very few women and juveniles are registered as unemployed in comparison with men, and the figures for men present the best picture of conditions in the area from the angle of the present investigation.)These figures show that unemployment amongst men in all areas was serious although not all were affected to the same degree.5. Looking at the problem from the angle of numbers unemployed as distinct from percentages, the offices do not fall into the same order. The following figures show in descending order the numbers of men wholly unemployed at 23rd April, 1934, in each area : Cleator Moor Employment Exchange .. .. 2,210Whitehaven Employment Exchange . . .. 1,810Workington Employment Exchange . . .. 1,784Maryport Branch Employment Office.. .. 1,684Haltwhistle Branch Employment Office .. 759Cockermouth Branch Employment Office .. 5S8Millom Branch Employment Office    .. .. 559Aspatria Branch Employment Office .. .. 505Harrington Branch Employment Office .. 451Alston Branch Employment Office    .. .. 1506. The position as regards each of these places is briefly reviewed in the following paragraphs.(1) Cleator Moor&apos;s peak figure of unemployment amongst men since 1st January, 1929, was 2,914 on 27th June, 1932. This figure had fallen to 2,246 on 23rd April, 1934, but. the drop was due mainly to a reduction in the number of men temporarily stopped from work. There was only a small reduction (203) in the number of wholly unemployed from the date when the register as a whole was at its highest point. Cleator Moor was described in the Manchester University as &quot; partially derelict &quot; and the description still applies to it. It cannot be said to be wholly derelict. One iron-ore mine which had been shut for some years actually re-opened during the present investigation.   It has so far taken some 120 men only and
it is not anticipated that it wdl re-absorb more than 200 men. Other iron-ore mines are also working in the southern portion of-the district included in the Cleator Moor Exchange area. On the other hand, practically no work is avadable in the Frizington and Arlecdon portions of the area.(2) In Whitehaven the peak figure of unemployment was reached on 26th September, 1932, when the men in all categories (i.e. wholly unemployed, casual workers and temporardy stopped) numbered 3,232. At 23rd April, 1934, the corresponding figure was 1,975. This marked improvement is attributable to a change in the manage-ment of the local coal mines, upon which the prosperity of Whitehaven mainly depends. Since this change of management, employment has steadied. The number of men &quot;temporarily stopped&quot; has been reduced from the figure at the &quot;peak&quot; date as has also the number wholly unemployed. Despite this improve-ment, unemployment is stdl very serious, though the town clearly cannot be described as &quot; derelict &quot; in any sense.(3) Workington at 23rd Aprd, 1934, had the second lowest per-centage of unemployment for men. Its peak figure since January, 1929, was reached on 27th June, 1932, when 4,162 men were registered in all categories. This total figure had fallen to 2,423 on 23rd April, a drop which, while suggesting a substantial improve-ment in the employment position, was almost wholly accounted for by the more regular employment of men attached to the United Steel Company, which dominates the town and which has con-centrated its Cumberland production in Workington. In contrast to Whitehaven, which could show some reduction in the number of its men who were wholly unemployed, Workington actually had an increase in this category from 1,723, when the total men&apos;s register was at its highest point, to 1,784 at 23rd April, 1934. Workington, therefore, although in no sense can it be described as a &quot; derelict &quot; area, is still suffering from heavy unemployment.(4) Maryport, like Cleator Moor, was described in the Manchester Survey Report as &quot; partially derelict.&quot; Its condition was said -to be &quot; desperate.&quot; The town was described, for the most part, as living on public funds. Maryport stdl had at 23rd April, 1934, more than half its insured population (57-3) out of work. Its highest register of men occurred on 17th August, 1931, when 1,954 were unemployed and there was but little difference in the figure on 23rd Aprd, 1934, when 1,830 were on the local register, of whom 1,684 (mainly colliers) were wholly unemployed.Two collieries are stdl at work in the district, though with reduced personnel, and there are several other small industries which keep going, though with some difficulty. There is little prospect of local development, however, and during the present investigation the town had the highest percentage of unemployment in Cumberland. It can stUl be accurately described as &quot; partially ^derelict.&quot;
(5) The town of Hallwhistle in Northumberland is not without some employment for its inhabitants but its working concerns are now all on a small scale and they show little prospect of much expansion. There is one colliery which re-opened in October, 1933, and had 30 men and boys employed in April, 1934, which may provide some additional work next year. The area was, however, severely hit when, in 1931 and 1932, two collieries which formerly employed 500 and 300 men closed down. The peak of unemployment in Haltwhistle occurred in November, 1931, when 1,101 men were on the Branch Office register. By 23rd April, 1934, this figure had fallen to 779 which, however, represented 57-3 per cent, of the insured men. There appears to be undeveloped coal in the area and there are some small industries, e.g., a flourishing paint factory. The area is, therefore, not strictly &quot; derelict &quot; but it is so severely depressed as to come near to inclusion in that category.(6) Cockermouth had 45-3 per cent, of its men unemployed on 23rd April, 1934. The town of Cockermouth itself cannot be described as &quot;derelict&quot; but the Branch Office area contains a village Broughton which comes near to being in the derelict category. Cockermouth&apos;s peak figure of unemployment amongst men was S59 on 13th July, 1931, which declined to 593 on 23rd April, 1934 ; but between these two dates the number of men &quot; wholly unemployed &quot; rose from 314 to 588.(7) The future of Millom, which lies on the sea coast 30 miles south of Whitehaven, is most uncertain. Its April, 1934, percentage of unemployment (33-1) gives little indication of the serious state into which the town appears to be drifting. Its register of men &quot; wholly unemployed &quot; was as high on 23rd April, 1934, as at the date (24th October, 1932) when total unemployment in Millom reached its highest point since January, 1929. The area depends upon iron-ore mining and iron manufacture. Its most prosperous concern is the Millom and Askam Haematite Company which employed 3S0 men (190 working two weeks in three) during the present investigation.The Hodbarrow Mining company&apos;-, which is the only other concern of note, cannot dispose profitably of its iron ore; and though the Company has pursued a policy of bringing ore up to the surface instead of stopping the mine, there are now some 170,000 tons stored above ground which cannot find a purchaser.Future prospects in Millom are, therefore, very doubtful. Millom is not &quot; derelict &quot; at the moment but it may in the not distant future come much more nearly within that category.(8) Aspatria has in the past relied upon coal mining for its livelihood-hood but one by one the pits in the neighbourhood have closed down and to-day only one is in operation. The continued existence of this pit is problematical. With an unemployment precentage for men of 37 Aspatria is not yet &quot; derelict &quot; but it is in such a precarious state industrially that it certainly falls within the field
of consideration. Its peak figure of unemployment amongst men was 1,177 on 13th July, 1931. This had declined to 518 on 23rd Aprd, 1934, but, as in the Cockermouth area, the reduction was due to &quot; temporardy stopped &quot; workers returning to employment and between the dates mentioned the number of men wholly unemployed rose from 278 to 505.(9) Harrington had the lowest percentage (28-2) of men unemployed in the area. The total register reached its highest point (1,534) on 27th June, 1932, and was reduced to 527 on 23rd April, l934, but between these two dates the number of &quot; wholly unemployed &quot; men only declined from 559 to 451. The Harrington area includes the vdlage of Distington which is severely depressed.(10) Alston with 41 per cent, of its insured men unemployed on 23rd Aprd, 1934, had only 150 wholly without work. Its total men&apos;s register had declined from 312 at 16th November 1931, to 153 at 23rd April, 1934, and has since fallen lower stdl.Alston has some small industries and is in some degree a holiday resort. There arc lead mines in the vicinity and the Company operating them is sinking a new shaft. If this is done successfuUy, Alston&apos;s unemployment problem wdl be greatly diminished. Though, therefore, its percentage of unemployment is high, Alston does not fall for consideration as a derelict area.7. This brief review of the unemployment position in the area leads me to the following conclusions :- (1) &quot;Considered by Ministry of Labour offices, no area is absolutely derelict, but the Cleator Moor and Maryport areas come nearest to justifying the use of this term.(2) Within the different areas, varying unemployment problems are to be found. Areas with less high percentages of unemployment (regarded as a whole) than others never-theless contain districts far more seriously hit. Examples are Broughton in the Cockermouth area and Distington in the Harrington area. Moreover, parts of Cleator Moor and Maryport areas are in worse case than others. Cleator Moor includes Frizington which has perhaps more cause than any other town or village in Cumberland to be termed &quot; derelict.&quot; The Manchester University Survey Report says of it : &quot; the conditions .... almost beggar descrip-tion for this town is almost completely without employ-ment of any kind, and without hope of it in the future.&quot; The employment position in Frizington has not changed since that report was written. The town of Egremont (also in the Cleator Moor area), on the other hand, though not without an unemployment problem, is less severely hit by unemployment than Frizington. Maryport covers the sorely hit villages of Flimby, Broughton Moor and Dearham, whose state is in some respects more depressing than that of Maryport itself.
s(3) The worst problems in West Cumberland cannot be treated in isolation. The towns and villages are in general so close together, and so interdependent, that improvement in the employment position or the reverse in one is almost bound to affect another. In considering future possi-bilities, and remedial measures, West Cumberland must substantially be regarded as a whole. If industrial development should take place, it would be quite im-possible to confine the employment thereby rendered available to men from the most depressed places. It would also be essential to extend any special transfer facilities that may be offered to surplus labour in any part of the area and not to limit such facilities to persons from one or two selected areas only.8. Even, in appearance it would, generally speaking, be a misnomer to describe any part of West Cumberland as completely &quot; derelict.&quot; Abandoned mines and iron works there are, but they are scattered over several districts. Some of the worst hit towns are nevertheless neither ill-kept nor dilapidated. Maryport, for example, still presents a good appearance and from the land is neither dismal nor depressing though from the sea the almost deserted docks dominate the scene and lend colour to the description of the town as derelict. The town contains a number of good-class houses, many of which are, I was told, inhabited by retired persons seagoing engineers, ships&apos; officers, etc. There are no obvious signs of severe distress either in the appearance of Maryport or of its inhabitants. The same can be said of the adjoining village of Dearham. Dcarham presented a remarkably good appearance and, although its inhabi-tants have been severely hit by unemployment, they showed no outward and visible sign of deterioration.Cleator Moor, on the other hand, is both drab and depressing. The town is almost wholly composed of workmen&apos;s dwellings of a type which must have presented a not very cheerful aspect even in times when industry was thriving. Now the houses grow more dreary and dull and there are obvious signs of industrial depression. Still more forcibly is the visitor to Frizington impressed with the strain which its people have endured, for here the houses had very definitely a decayed appearance and the inhabitants a more noticeable air of depression than those of neighbouring towns and villages. To some extent this may be due to the character of the inhabitants since Frizington has tended to attract to itself some of the poorer type of inhabitants of Whitehaven and elsewhere. Arlecdon, the next village, though as badly hit industrially, presents a better appearance.Workington and Whitehaven, the largest towns in the area and both definitely industrial, certainly did not present to the eye a &quot; derelict &quot; appearance but in these towns, as elsewhere, deeper
29010. The position of the principal industries in the area is briefly described below: (1) Iron and Steel Manufacture. The iron and steel industry in West Cumberland is now concentrated in Workington and Mdlom. Before the War, there were blast furnaces in operation at Cleator Moor, Distington, Harrington and Maryport. All these are now closed down. Mdlom produces pig iron only and the centre of the iron and steel industry in West Cumberland is at Workington, a &quot; Steel Town &quot; dominated by the United Steel Companies, Limited, which have concentrated their Cumberland production at Working-ton. It seems probable that this town is now a definitely settled centre for iron and steel production by the United Steel Companies which at present employ some 3,000 men in Workington. More regular employment was being given to considerable numbers of workers during the present investigation than during the 1932 Survey. The Companies&apos; plant has, however, been modernised and is turning out steel to-day with much less labour than formerly Ienquiry would reveal damage done by long spells of unemployment, not perhaps so much to the physical as to the mental well-being of the people.9. Faced with this serious unemployment problem, it is essential to consider the industrial prospects of West Cumberland. The Manchester University Survey Report points out: (1) that for the past fifty years the basic industry on the West Coast has been iron and steel production; (2) that although coal mining may actually employ more labour, a very large proportion of the output of coal is used by the local coke ovens and blast furnaces ; and (3) that the vital factor in the presence of iron and steel production is, of course, the local supply of high quality haematite ore.The Manchester Investigators, in summing up a valuable chapter in their report upon the industrial instability of the area, say : &quot; The industries upon which Cumberland and Furness have depended have been those which are naturally most subject to violent fluctuations, which depend upon raw materials that threaten to become exhausted in the near future ; which have been hit most seriously by changes in world trading conditions since the end of the War ; and in which industrial re-organisation and technical processes threaten to reduce both output and employment. It seems impossible to escape the conclusions that the future of these industries is far from promising and that the course of events suggests a continuance of the general industrial decline which has dated from about 1880 in Cumberland and from the end of the War in the Furness district.&quot;
was told that three blast furnaces produce to-day what nine did before and, consequently, there is, so far as iron and steel are concerned, a definite surplus of labour in Workington.The iron industry in Millom offers no prospects of absorbing surplus labour. There is, indeed, a surplus there. The men affected have, therefore, little or no prospect of absorption in their own industry in West Cumberland.(2) Coal Mining. Coal of excellent quality and almost unlimited in quantity exists in the.Whitehaven to Workington coastal belt. Even in the Maryport, Aspatria, Cockermouth triangle, where unemployment amongst coal miners is perhaps most severe, the depression is due to causes other than absence of coal; though some pits have gone out of production it is probable that workable coal would be found if new shafts were sunk.The Manchester University Investigators estimated in 1932, that-there was &quot; a surplus in the coal mining industry of at least 2,(J(ln workers a surplus partly due to the decline in output, partly to the increased use of machinery in coal getting, and partly to the failure.of the labour force to shrink with the decreased demand for it.&quot; Since the date of their enquiry, however, Messrs. Priestman, Collieries Ltd., with established connections with Sweden and Spain, have taken over the Whitehaven Collieries and they are confident that the shipment abroad of Whitehaven coal can be considerably extended. They are expending considerable capital in renovating the pits and are aiming at double their present production at least. It is not ton much to say that they have completely changed the industrial outlook of Whitehaven. Coal mining employment has already been increased and regularised. The policy of the Company (which also possesses coke ovens) is deliberately to avoid short-time working if possible, and there seems no doubt that in Whitehaven coal mining offers definite possibilities of further employment. In part, however, this will depend upon improved transport facilities to which reference-is made later. Without a better dock, there will be some further employment, but granted dock facilities for bigger boats, the extra employment rendered possible thereby may well amount to 1,000 men.In the Workington area, possible coal developments may in two or three years&apos; time require 1,500 men. Further reference to the probable effect of these developments upon the available labour force is made in a later section of this report.(3) Iron Ore Mining. This industry is highly unlikely to afford more employment. It may even give less. In the northern part of the iron ore zone the smaller mines have either been worked out or abandoned as not economically workable, with the exception of the Crowgarth Mine at Cleator Moor which re-opened during the
present investigation. Iron ore mining is, however, still carried on farther south on some scale, though the mines which are in production are getting higher output on less men. A large mine in the Millom area is in a precarious position because it cannot find markets for its output. Its costs of production are also high owing to the fact that the main deposits have been exhausted and the existing workings are somewhat scattered. Flooding from the sea has, in addition, been a cause of difficulty.In discussion with persons representing the industry, reference was made to the heavy burden laid upon it by the payment ol royalties. On this matter strong feeling was expressed. The precise position varies with different mines, and the feeling that royalties should be reduced or redeemed is general.The Manchester University Investigators spoke of the reserves of iron ore in West Cumberland as &quot; highly problematical &quot; butadded :   &quot;If......further discoveries of rich supplies whichcould be exploited at low cost, such as that discovered at the Florence Mine (in Egremont) are made, the whole outlook of iron-ore mining in Cumberland would be altered. And such discoveries are by no means outside the bounds of possibdity. If, however, we are to rely upon the most authoritative estimates, the field wdl be approaching exhaustion within about twenty years. This cannot but have a profound influence upon the iron and steel industry in the area, although it is the view of a number of those interested in this industry that it could continue to produce from imported ores.&quot; There has been little change in the position since these words were written.11. Minor Industries. There are certain small industries carried on in the area and some of these are working steadily and even offering some prospect of expansion. Other small industries are having a hard struggle for existence and seem likely to follow former success-ful undertakings (such as the engineering shops at Maryport) which, in the steady movements towards concentration of production, have gone out of existence. In general, it can only be said that such successful small undertakings as exist arc too few in number and, also, too limited in size to justify the hope that, within a measurable time, they may have any appreciable effect upon the unemployment problem.There is, however, one possible development in the Whitehaven area which may have important results. Borings for gypsum have been taking place and gypsum in considerable quantities has been proved. If this gypsum mine develops, as is thought to be possible, it may mean the- employment of 400-500 men. This would be of special importance since iron ore miners would be admirably suited for the work. -
The same arguments in favour of better dock facilities apply to gypsum as to coal in para. 10 (2) above.12. Interdependence of the Principal Industries in the Area.-It has already been said, when considering the unemployment in the area, that substantially West Cumberland must be treated as a whole and that the towns and vdlages are, in general, inter-dependent. Industries, also, are interdependent. The best example is perhaps afforded by the United Steel Company which, as stated in the Manchester University Survey Report, &quot; owns blast-furnaces and steel-works, collieries and coke-ovens, iron-on; mines and limestone quarries in Cumberland and possesses at Workington a large dock capable of accommodating 10,000 ton ocean-going liners which bring in foreign ore and take out finished steel. In 1930, this concern employed in Cumberland nearly 7,000 workers, about one-half of the total insured persons employed in iron and steel, coal mining, coke-ovens and iron-ore mining in the Whitehaven, Workington and Cleator Moor districts.&quot; Take also the Millom and Askam Haematite Iron Company. This concern was described in the above-mentioned Report as controlling &quot; die North Lonsdale Iron and Steel Company Limited which, in turn, owns the Whitehaven Haematite Iron and Steel Company, Ltd., with blast-furnaces, now apparently closed down permanently, near Cleator Moor. The Millom and Askam Haematite Company also possesses the largest iron-ore mine in Cumberland the Florence Mine ; controls the Ullcoats Mining Co. Ltd., and has large, though not controlling, interests in the * Whitehaven Colliery Co. Ltd., with its coal mines and associated coke-ovens.&quot;It is by no means certain that West Cumberland industries may not become still more closely interlocked. The Hodbarrow Mining Company, for example, is having a desperate struggle to maintain its independent existence, and it is obvious that the United Steel Companies Ltd. must at least have cast enquiring eyes upon the Millom and Askam Haematite Company.13. The possibility of attracting New Industries to the Area-It is clearly highly desirable that new industries should, if possible, be attracted to West Cumberland, and in one important respect the area is more favourably situated than other depressed areas. It is not heavily rated nor does it carry any excessive debt burden. In 1932 the University Investigators stated that only four of the suggestions brought to their notice appeared to merit examination and in no one of these cases did subsequent enquiry lead to the* Since taken over by Priestman Collieries Ltd.
(1) The   Hydrogenation of Coal.conclusion that the immediate employment of substantial numbers of workpeople was likely. These suggestions were : The Investigators point out that the question as to &quot; whether Cumberland would be a suitable centre for a hydrogenation plant &quot; is a matter for technical experts but they caU attention to (a) the general difficulty which Cum-berland finds in developing new industries because of its distance from the main centres of popu-lation ;(b) the fact that the Cumberland coal-field is &quot; a high-cost centre.&quot;The Investigators state that their en-quiries showed that &quot; the conditions in Cumberland are not suitable for developments of this kind.&quot; The Investigators came to the conclusion that &quot; no immediate relief to the unemployment situation can reason-ably be anticipated from the radical improvement of communications or of holiday facdities along the West Coast.&quot;A review of Cumberland agriculture by Mr. D. H. Dinsdale of the Farm Economics Branch of Armstrong College, Newcastle-on-Tyne, is in-cluded in the Manchester University Survey Report. It &quot; throws grave doubts upon the likelihood of its economic expansion within the near future, to a degree which would pro-vide employment for any significant number of additional workers.&quot; The Investigators from Manchester write : &quot; with the present level of prices and profits there hardly seems to be a case in Cumberland for the necessary investment which would be involved in putting more people on the land. If such a policy were pursued, it would have to be undertaken with the broader social point of view in mind(2) The use of Coke Oven gas for town&apos;s pur-poses.(3) The development of Cumberland as a Holiday Centre.(4) Employment in Agriculture in Cirmberland.
(4) Employment, etc. continued that, whilst not immediately econo-mical from the side of monetary returns, it justified itself by providing occupation for many who were thrcaten-ing to lose their employability through continued unemployment.&quot;14. Hydrogenation. West Cumberland coal is, I am assured, entirely suitable for either hydrogenation or low temperature carbonisation, and it is by no means unlikely that at some future date there may be developments in the direction of one or the other process. There is, however, no immediate prospect of anything being done.15. I have no comment to offer on what the University Investi-gators say on items (2) (Use of Coke Oven gas for towns&apos; purposes) and (3) (Development of Cumberland as a Holiday Centre) of paragraph 13.16. Agriculture. On this there is more to be said than is con-veyed by the University Report.As regards a considerable number of the unemployed men in the area the problem they present is unlikely to be solved by either revival of industrial activity locally or by transfer. Some other means of arresting the decay of a fine people must be sought. Cumberland is after all mainly an agricultural county and many of its industrial workers, notably coal miners and iron-ore miners, have maintained a contact with the land not found among workers in the more highly industrialised areas.The difficulties involved in any land settlement policy are fully appreciated, but I submit that they ought to be faced. It can at any rate be said that, given the right conditions, there is a real prospect of success in West Cumberland.The fact that in the main the mineral wealth of Cumberland has been won over a wide area and worked in small units has preserved for the majority of the miners close contact with the countryside. In the main the population resides in small villages, and farms and farm life are intimately known to a large proportion of the popu-lation. It is common for boys on leaving school to go on to farms and to take up mining or other industrial work later.It is very doubtful, however, whether there is any but limited scope for the development of individual smallholdings. Quite apart from the relatively high cost of this form of land settlement and the probabdity that it could not be made an economic success on any scale, all the information gained as to the type and character of the people leads me to the conclusion that large scale &quot; business &quot; land cultivation is more likely to be suitable.
293This form of land cultivation would have many advantages over individual smallholdings. It would allow of the employment of skilled instructors and of proper marketing staff. The men could continue to reside in their existing homes, and they would preserve their status as employed persons. This last is likely to prove specially important, for more than one reason. Not only is it my belief that the men would, generally speaking, be likely to succeed only under control and guidance, freed from responsibility for marketing and the like, but, as industrial workers, the men have come to rely on Unemployment Benefit or Transitional Payments as a safeguard in the event of loss of work. Though as agricultural workers they would cease to be insured workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts as the law stands at present, they would still be employed persons for the purposes of unemployment assistance under the new legislation.The kind of land cultivation contemplated is of the soft fruit and market gardening type, coupled with poultry and pig-keeping. Though much of the land in West Cumberland is too bleak and high-lying for the purpose, I am assured that the land would be quite suitable for soft fruit and vegetable growing.It may here be noted that in the review of Cumberland agriculture included in the Manchester University Survey Report it is stated that the memorandum &quot; has taken no account of the important branch of agriculture which is concerned with the production of fruit and vegetables.&quot; The general conclusion cited above that Cumberland agriculture is unlikely to provide more employment is therefore not in conflict with the suggestions made herein for land development in connection with fruit and vegetables.There is already a cheese factory at Aspatria which has no outlet for its whey and there is an up-to-date tank cure bacon factory near Carlisle of some size which cannot get adequate supplies of local pigs.I do not contemplate that the State should embark upon this form of land cultivation or even give any direct subsidy towards its development. What is in my mind is that a Development Trust Company should be formed to develop this and any other cognate schemes, State assistance taking the form of a guarantee of part of the interest on any money raised.Schemes should be developed, if possible, in more than one area. The comparative proximity of many of the districts to one another renders linked schemes under one management quite feasible.Reference should be made here to some experiments which have been made in recent years in the area. These experiments have had for their aim the training of unemployed men in poultry-keeping in order to set them up as producers. One scheme, for example, near Mealsgate (see Appendix I) has been in operation
for some two years and the men concerned are about to launch out as independent producers. Hitherto, they have been in receipt of transitional payments, and it is important to record the fact that but for this assistance from public funds the scheme would not have started, still less reached its present stage. Yet it is doubtful if the men concerned were strictly entitled to transitional payments. These have really been made possible only by turning something of a blind eye upon the possibilities of the scheme. Title to transi-tional payments was admitted because the work was regarded as training for a subsidiary occupation. Yet the men are, in fact, about to abandon employment and to rely for their livelihood upon poultry-keeping. Even under the probably wider scope of the Unemployment Assistance Board, it may be doubted if assistance would be available for men who are undertaking training really with the aim of abandoning the status of employed persons. This is one, though not the dominant, factor in the proposals made in this report for land settlement upon an &quot; employment &quot; basis. This would permit of training being afforded with the aid of unemployment benefit or assistance in the initial stages of the scheme.17. At this stage, of course, only general submissions can be made but the scheme as I picture it must contain the following factors: (1) The enterprise must be on an adequate scale with varied products a standard or prescribed crop perhaps, but with also some margin for the individual to exercise his particular bent.(2) Linked schemes should be started in more than one place if possible (e.g., Cleator Moor, Aspatria, Broughton and Dearham) so that the effects of the new development would be felt throughout the area.(3) The holders should receive a period of training while in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance and there-after work under informed supervision. Buying and marketing would be a &quot; management &quot; undertaking.(4) The men should not be independent smallholders (though each man should have a subsistence holding of say -J- acre) but should be employed persons, thus preserving the right to insurance benefit or unemployment assistance, should they cease to be employed under the scheme for any reason. In this connection, the observations which follow later on the possible future demand for coal miners should be borne in mind. Some men may prefer to go back to the pits if work offers; or may be more suited to pit work if such became available,
18. Afforestation. Some afforestation work is being done in the area, but there is scope for much more. Further afforestation would, of course, have to be undertaken on its own merits. The amount of employment which would be afforded is, of course, impossible to estimate. At the same time, West Cumberland needs stop-gap employment during the next few years while the foreshadowed coal developments mature; and, if new afforestation schemes could be started on such a scale as to justify training centres like Kershopefoot and Kielder, they would be of definite advantage. Preparation work can occupy fairly considerable numbers.19. Harbour Development. Though not strictly relevant to the question of new industries, it is perhaps appropriate to refer here to the question of improving the dock facilities at Whitehaven. At present, these are not suitable for vessels of 4,000-5,000 tons, and the colliery company state that if they were improved it would mean a considerable expansion in their overseas trade. In fact, they maintain that it could be more than doubled but that such expansion turns upon the improvement of the docks. The making of the necessary alterations has been tentatively estimated to cost  300,000 and the state of the Harbour Commissioners&apos; finances makes it most unlikely that these alterations can be made without Government assistance.At Workington, the docks are, of course, of modern construction, and their erection has meant the decline of Maryport Docks. The latter are practically derelict and will remain so, unless some Government use can be made of them.The cost of carriage between Whitehaven and Workington is excessive. I was informed it is Is. 3d.-Is. 6d. per ton for the six mile haul.20. Minor Schemes. Reference has already been made to the mining of gjpsum. Certain possibilities of new production were put forward by a Coal By-products firm at Flimby. Similarly, suggestions for a brickworks were advanced from Haltwhistle. These new concerns would involve, of course, the raising of capital and their individual employment value would not be large. Never-theless, there seem possibilities in the development of small industries, either directly resting upon the raw materials of the area or arising out of demands following improved general prosperhy. In order that facilities might be rendered available, I recommend that the Development Trust Company referred to in connection with land development might, as a subsidiary object, be empowered to consider and assist the development of small industries in the area. In this connection, it should be stated that a small Trust Company
(see Appendix II) has already clone some most useful work in Cumberland, though largely in the Brampton area, which is outside the field of the present enquiry.21. Taking the most optimistic view of the effect upon the employment situation of a revival in the coal industry at Whitehaven, and of the development of the gypsum mine (which turns largely upon the improvement of the Dock) and at Workington (where there is no prospect of men being absorbed in any numbers for some two or three years), and if allowance is made also for the absorption of some of the unemployed upon land cultivation schemes and upon such small industries as may grow up, the fact remains that West Cumberland will have for years to come a substantial surplus of labour with no hope of outlet locally.22. Surplus Labour. -This leads me to the question of the probable extent of the labour surplus and of the character and condition of the workpeople included in it. As is known, the Employment Exchange registers are never static, but taking the average of the persons registered as &quot; wholly unemployed &quot; at three selected dates in 1934 (22.1.34; 23.4.34; and 14.5.34) as a rough guide to the surplus, the results are as follows : Men (wholly unemployed) ..       ..       .. 10,698Women ,,            ,, ..       ..       ..     545Boys ......382Girls     ,, ,, ......275Total......11,90023. Allowing for the prospects of more employment being offered in the coal industry and in gypsum mining and all other possibilities of the employment situation being relieved (as, for example, by some expansion in the distributive and allied trades following the employment of more men in the coal mines), there seems little likelihood in the area of investigation of the figures of unemployment amongst males of 18 years of age and over falling much below the figure of 7,000 in the most favourable circumstances. The employ-ment position of women and juveniles is described at a later stage of this report (see paragraphs 60 and 63.)24. Length of Unemployment. The strain imposed upon un-employed men and upon their families increases as spells of unemployment lengthen, and it was material to this investigation to ascertain the proportion of the workmen registered at the Employment Exchanges and Branch Employment Offices who had been out of work for twelve months or more.
The position at 23rd April, 1934, in regard to men claimants (and they constitute the great bulk of the register) is shown below : District.	Under 3 months.	Over 3 months and under 12 months.	12 months or more.

The men shown as having been unemployed for less than 3 months include those recorded as &quot; Temporarily Stopped &quot; or &quot; Casuals.&quot;25. When the figures relating to spells of unemployment are expressed in percentages, the two &quot; partially derelict &quot; towns of Cleator Moor and Maryport (and Haltwhistle in Northumberland) stand at the top of the list in respect of men unemployed for twelve months or more. All areas in West Cumberland (with the exception of Alston, which, as already stated, does not fall for consideration as a derelict area) have, however, a much higher percentage of men in this category than has the country as a whole, as the following table shows : 	Expressed as percentages of the total.

In one of the villages (Frizington -attached to Cleator Moor Employment Exchange) in which special interviews with unemployed men were arranged, it was found that out of 382 married claimants, 227 had been out of work over two years and 64 over four years. Of the 164 single claimants, 90 had been unemployed for more than two years and 18 for more than four years. No records are, however, available to show for the area as a whole the actual length of spells of unemployment which exceed twelve months.26. The Position of Unemployed Men in relation to the Unem-ployment Insurance Fund. It was also of consequence to ascertain during the investigation the means by which the unemployed people were being supported. The undernoted table shows the number of claims by men for (1) unemployment insurance benefit, and (2) transitional payments, which were current at 23rd April, 1934 : Analysis of Insurance Benefit and Transitional PaymentsClaims in Respect of Men and Young Men at 23rd April, 1934District.

The above table shows that the men in receipt of transitional payments (which are chargeable to the Exchequer and not to the Unemployment Insurance Fund) far outweigh the numbers in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit. Expressed in per-centages, Cleator Moor, Maryport and Haltwhistle again come at
the top of the list (see Column 3 of the table below) in regard to men receiving transitional payments.District.	Insurance Benefit.	Transitional Payments.

For example : Insurance       Transitional Benefit. Payments.Frizington: Married men    ..       ..      18 364Single men       ..       ..      13 151Broughton : -Married men    ..       ..        9 163Single men       ....        5 7228. It will, however, be noted how much higher are the percentages of men in receipt of transitional payments in West Cumberland as a whole than is the percentage for the country. Under Section 3 (2) of the Unemployment Act, 1934, some of the people now in receipt of transitional payunents will be qualified to draw additional Unemployment Insurance benefit when the new Act is in force. As, however, a claimant&apos;s right to further unemployment benefit is to be calculated according to a ratio rule which takes account of the contributions paid by him, and the benefit received, in the past five years, it follows that persons living in depressed areas will have less opportunity of benefiting by Section 3 (2) of the Act than people in more prosperous districts. It is clear that in West Cumberland the Unemployment Assistance Board will shortly have to deal with the bulk of the unemployed workpeople in the exercise of its function of
assisting all persons to whom Part II of the Act applies, and &quot; who are in need of work, and to promote their welfare, and in particular to make provision for their improvement and re-establishment of the condition of such persons with a view to their being in all respects fit for entry into or return to regular employment.&quot;29. Public Assistance. The Public Assistance Officer for the County of Cumberland furnished a statement showing the increase in the numbers of able-bodied unemployed relieved at the expense of the rates during the year ended 31st March, 1934, as compared with previous years.ABLE-BODIED UNEMPLOYED. (Ordinary Relief Cases not included.)	Lowest number relieved during any one week.				Highest number relieved during any one week.				Approx.

(In December, 1930, Cumberland&apos;s rate was 277 per 10,000 population.) Taking administrative counties in England, Durham has the highest rate with 697 per 10,000 and is followed by Cumberland with 390. Many persons have been in receipt of relief for long periods ; numbers of young men have not, since leaving school, had any chance of entering industry, and the Public Assistance Officer states that the great danger is that these people will become unemployable.He also said that &quot; the Work, Training and Instructional Schemes put into operation by the Public Assistance Committee have, without question, been of considerable benefit and value to numbers of men who would, but for the existence of such schemes, have been drifting aimlessly about, but even though all this is being done to maintain the employability of the men, the fact remains that there is no outlet whereby the persons concerned could be absorbed into paid employment.&quot;* Owing to a re-classification of the able-bodied recipients as from 1st April, 1931, the figures for 1931 cannot be compared with the figures for the following years.
30. Age Distribution. The following statement summarises the position as to the age distribution and marital state of the men who were on the live registers of the Employment Exchanges or Branch Employment Offices on 28th May, 1934 (see Appendix III for details) : 	Married.	Single.	Total.	Per cent.18-25	431	1,833	2,264	20-326-35	1,964	1,033	2,997	26-S36-45&apos;	1,732	455	2,187	19-6Over 45   ..	2.S66	860	3,726	33-3Total	6,993	4,181	11,174	100-0One third of the unemployed men were over 45 years of age, and the majority of these were married. Such men are not easily transferred to different occupations in new surroundings. A large number of them have worked in the Coal Mines, but have little prospect because of their age and, in some cases., their physical state, of returning to their old employment, even if the coal industry revives.31. The possibilities of Industrial Transference. The possibility of helping the younger men, both married and single, by means of transference scliemes has been carefully examined, as this is the obvious first line of attack upon the surplus. The finding of suitable employment in other districts presents much greater difficulty, however, to men and boys than it does to women and girls who, if they are willing to accept some type of domestic employment, have a choice of openings and of districts to which to go. The question of transference is discussed in the following paragraphs in its relation, first to men, secondly to women, and thirdly to boys and girls.32. Men. The Manchester University Investigators were of the opinion that, so far as men were concerned, the transference schemes had failed. They prefaced their comments, however, with the following statement: &quot; The Ministry of Labour, either through the normal placing work of the Employment Exchanges or through the special schemes of transference of unemployed persons from areas scheduled as &quot; depressed &quot;, has devoted a great deal of effort, since 1928, to this question in Cumberland. We have had the advantage of discussing these schemes with the officials re-sponsible for their operation, and it is impossible to speak too highly of the energy, zeal, and ingenuity which has been put into this work. The Local Exchange officials have often stepped outside their official duties and responsibdities to deal
with personal obstacles. The Divisional Officers, also, have been only too eager to seize upon any expedient, within the powers that the various schemes conferred upon them, to forward the constant vigilance and activity of the local officials. So far as Cumberland is concerned, nothing could be further from the truth than to say that the Industrial Transference Schemes have been worked in an inflexible, official, and routine manner, without any regard for the human factors involved.&quot; We pay this tribute to the Employment Exchange officials, partly because their steady work, skill, and enthusiasm under such depressing conditions are often lost sight of, and partly to make the point that if the schemes for Industrial Transference of adults appear to have produced rather meagre results, it is not due to any fault in those administering them. It must be attributable either to the type of labour to be dealt with or to the general features of the schemes themselves.&quot;33. They went on to say that a study of the causes of the failure of transference pointed to the immense difficulties which were encountered in the efforts of the Exchanges to transfer men to more prosperous areas, and cited the case of the coal miners in Cumberland as an excellent illustration of the character of the problem. They say:-&quot; The coal-mining industry in Cumberland has not, since 1921, suffered to the same extent as many other coal-fields in Great Britain but, nevertheless, there has been a fairly constant surplus of about 2,000 workers since 1925. Efforts have been made to transfer some of these to Kent, and other coal-fields, and a substantial number of miners have been sent there at the public expense. In the vast majority of cases, these workers have returned home..........&quot;The miner in Cumberland often lives in an isolated village where coal-mining has been for many years the only occupation of the population. The coal-miner&apos;s occupation, in itself, calls for individual initiative and makes for an independent attitude in his dealings with others. It is not surprising that his mode of life in remote valleys often makes of him an individual who is independent and reserved, shy almost to the point of aggressiveness and one who feels strongly attached to his own hdls and valleys. Indeed, the Cumberland coal-miner is not an industrial worker in the strict sense ; he has maintained his contact with the land ; he makes an excellent agricultural worker and he shows, in consequence, a strong feeling for his home place. It is not possible to over-estimate the importance of these human factors in the problem of transference. The Cumberland miner has been a failure in Kent, partly because of his independence, but also partly because of the deep roots
which he has struck in his home village. In our enquiries we have encountered the most extraordinary cases which prove this. Many Cumberland miners left jobs in Kent even though they had to walk home. Many returned before they had worked more than a few days, and even when the Employment Exchanges sought to transfer groups of miners to the same place the results were not very much more successful.&quot; Undoubtedly/the natural resistance to transfer is seen much more strongly among miners than among workers in other occupations, but elsewhere the problem, whilst different in degree, is the same in kind. In the face of this evidence, it does not seem, in the case of older men, that the Ministry of Labour could profitably extend its activities towards industrial transference. As in the past, unassisted transfer wdl un-doubtedly lessen the surplus of labour ; and the Employment Exchanges can be relied upon, in the course of their normal placing work, to lose no opportunity of assisting those who are anxious to migrate. In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Public Assistance Committees, and the Local Education Authorities should make every attempt, along the lines suggested in the Report of the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance, to lessen monotony of unemployment and to maintain those out of work in employable condition. For the rest, the unemployed must continue to be maintained by the State and the Local Authorities.&quot;34. In Appendix IV is given a summary of the results of industrial transference efforts for men. The figures cover two periods the first from the date when each area was scheduled as &quot; depressed &quot; up to the end of June, 1932 (the period covered by the University Report), and the second from the 1st July, 1932, to 31st May, 1934.35. In commenting on the earlier period, the University Investi-gators point out &quot; that it must not be overlooked that the special Industrial Transference schemes have been in operation only since the middle of 192S, so that they were working only eighteen months before the depression of 1930 and its consequent universal unemploy-ment rendered labour transference almost impossible. Moreover, since such schemes were intended to supplement the migration that had taken place through the independent initiative of the individual, it follows that they were dealing, on the whole, with workers who were less tractable and enterprising than those who moved on their own account. It is, again, commonly accepted that the present system of unemployment insurance, great as are its social benefits in other directions, lessens the mobility of labour.&quot;36. When the figures of men transferred through the Ministry of Labour offices to work outside West Cumberland, in the second period shown in Appendix IV, i.e., from the 1st July, 1932, to the
31st May, 1934, are examined, it wdl be seen that the total figure in 23 months is 291 not a very large number from an area which has approximately 10,000 men registered as wholly unemployed. The marked fall in the number of men transferred after the 1st July, 1932, is due to the cessation of public works promoted by Local * Authorities for the relief of unemployment, as a consequence of the financial crisis of 1931.   Many of the relief schemes contained a provision that a proportion of the men employed shoidd be drawn from the depressed mining areas, and a considerable number of men, -mainly unskilled, was sent from West Cumberland to various parts ,of the country for employment on these &quot;works.&quot;   The majority of the schemes came to an end during 1931 and early 1932, and the demands for labour ceased.37. Appreciable numbers of Cumberland men were also taken for employment on the Manchester Water Department Scheme at Hawcswater, part of which was covered by state grant, but work on this scheme was stopped by the Manchester Corporation in 1931. A modified scheme has recently been re-started at Haweswater, and I understand that a certain number of West Cumberland men will be employed.3S. The district transferring the largest number of men subsequent to the 1st July, 1932, is Workington, and the number of men concerned totals 7S. Some of these men proceeded as far afield as London, Kent, Essex, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, but as many as 34 have taken work in districts of Cumberland outside the survey region. Though the precise figure is not known, it is probable that over 20 of the total of 78 transferred have already returned home and a further 10 at least are expected to return. A significant feature is that the majority of men sent from Workington to employment away from Cumberland were of the artisan class, and the core of the problem, the unskilled workers, has been largely untouched since the relief schemes with the demand for labourers came to an end. The position revealed at Workington can in this respect be regarded as typical of the other districts in the region.39. While in Workington I had a most interesting interview with a prominent Trade Union official who has, throughout the whole period of the depression, faced with foresight and a marked sense of reality the effect upon the labour force of the changes which haw been taking place in the industrial structure of the area. This official has not only been able to read clearly &quot; the writing on the wall,&quot; but he has not hesitated to preach the need for transference, and I believe that his influence has had a definite bearing upon the fact that from Workington more men have been transferred than from any other area covered b)&apos; this investigation. This belief is supported by the fact that recentby when some fifteen men were under consideration for employment at Dagenham for which a
high standard of physical fitness is required, it was the Trade Union Secretary who secured money to cover the cost of medical examina-tion in Workington prior to transfer. Even here, however, it is necessary to record the fact that the men were going to work similar to that which they had performed in Workington, i.e., it was a normal industrial demand they met.40. This Trade Union Secretary left me in no doubt, however, of his opinion that, at the best, Transference Schemes can help only a portion of the men who are unemployed. Transfer offers little possibility for the older men, for example, and on this head he remarked that &quot; callous though my words may sound, nature will solve this problem.&quot; In explanation of his statement, he gave some facts which were later reported in the Manchester Guardian of 16th June, 1934, in the following words : &quot; For years two trade union branches in Cumberland, each with 360 members, drew roughly&apos; the same sum each year in funeral benefits. Then in 1932 the works at which the members of one branch were employed closed. That year the union paid out to the branch affected  206 in funeral benefit for the deaths of 19 members or wives of members. The branch whose members were still working drew only  45 in funeral benefit for four deaths.&quot; In 1933 the closed works reopened; the works which had been open closed. The first branch fell back to the normal amount in funeral benefits ; the second made increased claims to the same extent as the other had done in the previous year. One cannot generalise on so narrow a foundation, but in the town itself it is quoted to prove the truth of the belief that the fretful idleness of unemployment eats away a man&apos;s desire and power to live.&quot;41. Interesting as these figures are, however, they cover too limited a field to enable general conclusions to be drawn as to the whole area. To the passing observer, at any rate, there is little sign of physical degeneracy amongst the unemployed certainly less than would be visible in the more congested industrial districts of other parts of the country. Pure air and free access to the country-side may account for this. Probably also, the money&apos; received by way of unemployment benefit or transitional payment goes further in West Cumberland than in the cities. Rents are low and costs of living generally appear to be relatively less high.42. The results of a special enquiry into the composition of the live registers of certain of the worst-hit districts support the view that the men have, all things considered, remained sur-prisingly fit. Every man on the register at Frizington in the Cleator Moor area, and Broughton in the Cockermouth area, was specially
interviewed. At Maryport, also, all the men up to the age of 36 were seen. A summary of this enquiry is contained in Appendix V. From this it will be seen that over 90 per cent, of the men (married and single alike) were regarded as suitable for direct transfer. I was informed that few of either married or single appeared to be in need of reconditioning.43. In parenthesis, it may be said that to outward view the physical condition of the children also appeared to be, generally speaking, good. Evidence from Dr. Fraser, the County Medical Officer of Health, supports the general impression that the chddren are on the whole well looked after, although he stated that there has been an increase in the incidence of rickets and eye-trouble among children, particularly those below school-age. (Both these diseases are, of course, examples of the results of mal-nutrition). One important factor in maintaining the health of the school-children is, undoubtedly, the action of the Education Authorities in considerably extending the issue of free milk to children. At the end of 1933, 688 children were receiving free milk as against 532 in 1931 and at present nearly 2,000 receive milk and biscuits with a special fat content. These are given instead of providing school meals.At the same time, Dr. Fraser drew attention to certain dis-disturbing features of the mortality statistics, which he attributed to the effect of prolonged unemployment. The infant death rate in Cumberland during 1933 was 71 per thousand births as against the rate for England and Wales of 64 per thousand, while the maternal death rate is also very high. In 1933 it was 6-79 per thousand (an increase of 2-04 over 1932) as compared with the death rate for England and Wales of 4-23. Ante-natal schemes are in operation and extra nourishment is being issued to an increasing number of women in a mal-nourished condition. The number of notifications of pulmonary and non-pulmonary tuber-culosis is also on the increase, and in the opinion of Dr. Fraser, this is due to the fact that the resistance power of the people has been lowered.44. One interesting feature of the special enquiry referred to in paragraph 42 was the expressed willingness of the men to transfer. At Frizington 89-3 per cent, of the married men and 92-5 per cent, of the single men expressed such wdlingness and were regarded as suitable for direct transfer. At Broughton the equivalent figures were 83-7 per cent, married men, and 96-1 per cent, single men, while at Maryport, where the analysis was limited to the group 1S-36 years, the figures were higher, i.e., 98-5 per cent, in the case of married men and 96-6 per cent, in the case of single men. The numbers who were definitely unwilling to transfer totalled 5 at Frizington, 14 at Broughton, and 5 at Maryport. This, at first sight, gives an impression contrary not only to that obtained by
the Manchester University investigators, but also to the opinion of competent local observers. In fact, there is no real conflict since, almost invariably, the expression of willingness to take up employment in another district was qualified by some such state-ment as that they would do so if they could get &quot; a suitable job at a proper wage.&quot; The impression left with the interviewing officers was that if a concrete offer of work away from Cumberland was made, a good reason would be found in many cases why employment elsewhere could not be taken. Individual analysis revealed that 36 men at Frizington, 10 at Broughton, and 40 of the limited number at Maryport had previously transferred to non-depressed areas but had subsequently returned to their native soil. This represents approximately 7 per cent, of the total cases covered by the enquiry.45. This is. not meant to imply that the men are either lazy or content to live on the community without return. It means, however, that the men want work near to their homes and that it will take a good deal to move them. The Chairman of the Dearham Parish Council conveyed a very common feeling when he expressed himself somewhat as follows : &quot; We are up against transference. We do not want to see our community breaking up. We know that there is abundant wealth (?&apos;. ., coal) under our feet, and we want to work that coal.&quot;Even though the inhabitant of Frizington realises that there is nothing likely to become available for him in Frizington itself, he still seems to hope that something may turn up sufficiently near to obviate removal.46. It is undoubtedly true that the roots of the typical Cumbrian are deeply embedded in his native soil and he is most reluctant to leave the place in which he has been born and reared, even for a place a few miles away. Geographical isolation, the fact that local industry has been self-contained and the natural beauty of the neighbourhood have all encouraged this characteristic. Even to-day, the world beyond the hills tends to be to him a foreign land and people coming into his district are regarded as strangers after many years. None but the highest terms were, however, used in describing the Cumbrian as a citizen and workman. In some of the towns there is an admixture of non-Cumbrian elements, not always of the best type, but this does not seriously detract from the general description of the inhabitants of the area as a fine body of people who have maintained their moral and physical standard to a remarkable degree in spite of the prolonged and severe industrial depression in the area.
47. In the Manchester University Survey Report special reference was made to the resistance of the miner to transference and a question which naturally arose during the present investigation was whether miners should be encouraged to transfer from a district which may, in a few years&apos; time, offer employment for an additional 3,000to 3,500 men. I was informed by the Manager of the Employment Exchange in Whitehaven (the area which is likely to have the first, and ultimately the largest, demand for colliery workers) that there were on the men&apos;s Unemployed Register, which showed a total of 1,975 on 23rd April, more than 1,000 men who were unskilled in any trade and who constituted a very real problem.   Apparently, as one pit after another closed, the best of the workers were selected by employers who were stdl carrying on and, consequently, the unemployed register contained the less fit and less well qualified people.   Those who have been out of work for long periods tend, with passing years and continued idleness, to become less able ever to resume the strenuous life of the coal miner and it is possible that a revival in the coal industry may reveal a shortage of skilled men, eg., hewers.   A review was, therefore, made of the qualifications of the men registered as &quot; hewers &quot; at eight selected offices of the Ministry of Labour in the area.   Of some 1,200 men registered as hewers at these offices, approximately 750 only were thought to be reason-ably likely to get jobs as hewers if colliery employment became brisk.   The results of this review strengthened my impression that if, and when, the coal industry develops to the extent foreshadowed in earlier paragraphs of this report, the demand for colliery workers may well be such as to need special measures to meet it.  It should, therefore, be recognised now that, when that time approaches, there may be good cause for meeting a shortage of coal getters by opening the industry to iron-ore miners which, of course, would entail a revision of the &quot; Undertaking &quot; entered into (under Section IS of the Mining Industry Act, 1926) by the Mining Association of Great Britain..   This aimed at securing that, in the recruitment of persons for employment in the coal industry-, preference should be given to persons who were employ-ed in that industry in the week ended 30th Aprd, 1926, or whose last regular employment before that date was in the coal industry.   I believe that leaders of the coal miners locally would not offer any objection to the entry of iron-ore miners into the coal mines ; whde it is highly probable that the entry of miners from districts outside Cumberland would be fiercely resented.   One important factor is the increased use of coal-cutting machinery for which iron-ore miners would be specially suited.   It is, of course, by no means certain that iron-ore miners would, in any numbers, be willing to take employment in the coal mines.   They have tended in the past to regard themselves as a superior type and many of them might still be reluctant to work as coUiers.
48. In spite, however, of this possible need for labour in the coal industry in the future, there is no ground meanwhile for retaining every young man in West Cumberland if work can be found elsewhere. At the best it will be some years before industry improves sufficiently to absorb moie than a relatively limited number of those who are now unemployed, and every possible effort should continue to be made to encourage transfer to areas where the possibility of employment exists. As the University Investigators state : &quot; On both social and economic grounds, the heavy and often continuous unemployment among boys and young men (i.e., males between 16 and about 24 years of age) in the Survey Region constitutes perhaps the most serious aspect of theunemployment problem ...... it would be nothing short ofan admission of complete national helplessness if the attitude of resignation, which must inevitably be taken up towards unemployment among older adults, has to be accepted also in regard to unemployment among young men. Every device, therefore, must be adopted to create out of the period of unemployment an opportunity for further education, technical training or occupation. Secondly, transfer should be effected as quickly as possible and perhaps under schemes which might well be criticised as unduly drastic or rash if the present position were not so serious.&quot;49. Questions of juvenile transference and the desirability of encouraging training amongst young men are dealt with later. As regards steps which might be taken to press on with direct transfer, it is difficult to suggest anything which has not already been tried. Two things might, perhaps, be given greater attention, (1) the allocation to West Cumberland of more vacancies in other districts and (2) more intensive publicity efforts.As regards (1) it will, of course, only be possible to give preference to West Cumberland men in relation to the claims of equally, or more depressed, localities. So far as (2) publicity is concerned, it must be admitted that much has already been done. The publication of the Manchester University Survey Report had a profound effect upon responsible authorities and thinking people in West Cumberland, and conferences subsequently convened by the National Council of Social Service and by Mr. W. Nunn, M.P. for Whitehaven, were attended by many prominent local people and received considerable publicity. Nowhere perhaps was the report studied more carefully than in Workington, the town from which the request for a Govern-ment Survey of the area was originally sent to the Ministry of Labour. It is doubtful, however, if the average working member of the community was impressed or moved in any&apos; way at the picture drawn by the University Investigators, despite all the publicity given to the report by the local press.
50. As the figures in paragraph 30 and Appendix III show, more than half the unemployed men in the area of investigation (52-9 per cent.) were 36 years of age and upwards, and as many as 33-3 per cent, were over 45. These men present a problem which seems intractable by transfer.51. Government Training Centres and Instructional Centres. TheGovernment Training Centres, which aim at giving instruction in skilled trades to men who are unskilled but who have the capacity to become craftsmen, seem to offer less opportunities to the West Cumberland unemployed than might have been thought. For quite a number of the skilled trades in which training is given, e.g., engineering machining, fitting, welding, cabinet-making, hairdressing, etc., a good standard of general education, desire to succeed and mental alertness is required, and, apart altogether from any question of lack of interest in the schemes, relatively few amongst the young unemployed men seem to have the necessary qualities.52. The Instructional Centres, whose object is to improve- the standard of fitness and thereby increase the employability of men who have had little or no work for a long period, also have hitherto not recruited as many from this area as might have been expected. This may be due as much to the fact that so many of the men have retained apparent physical fitness, as to reluctance to go to a Centre53. Since the Manchester University enquiry (i.e., from 1st July, 1932) up to 31st May, 1934, 270 men have,been sent to Government Training Centres and 274 to Instructional Centres. Of the men attending the Government Training Centres, 153 were placed in employment direct from the Centres between 1st July, 1932, and 31st May, 1934. There are no figures available to show the number of men who returned home after they had been placed from Govern-ment Training Centres, but for the area as a whole it is estimated as being in the neighbourhood of 35 per cent. On 20th June, 1934, there were on the &quot; wholly unemployed &quot; register of the offices in the area covered by the investigation, 226 men who had attended Government Training Centres and 308 men who had attended Instructional Centres. The men who are eligible for these training courses are, of course, the young fit people, the ones who, in fact, have the best prospect of returning to work locally when there is some revival of the staple industries, and with that revival in sight the disinclination of the young men to undergo training has become more marked. The Ministry of Labour officials state that in all parts throughout the North-Western counties it requires hard work to arouse in unemployed people a real interest in the training schemes but that nowhere is the task so hard as in West Cumberland, and this has been the experience not only of the officials whose work lies in the north, but also of an officer who recently came from the south with knowledge of the growing demand in and around London for men from the Government Training Centres, to conduct a special
recruiting campaign in West Cumberland. Here he encountered not only apathy but at times a definite hostility to the schemes and he came reluctantly to the conclusion that West Cumberland offered a poor field for further recruitment. He stated in a report dated 23rd June, 1934 : &quot; The results from the \veek&apos;s activities had been very disappointing. On the whole, men seemed to have no desire to leave home, while many pleaded home circumstances and in some districts showed hostility to transference for training. In some areas men are hoping to return to work at an early date in collieries and steel works.&quot; The special interviews with unemployed men at Frizington, Broughton and Maryport (see Appendix V) showed that a number of the unemployed who, in the past, have worked mainly in coal mines and steel works are not of the mental calibre to take full advantage of the training in skilled work which is offered at the Government Training Centres. As the figures indicate, by far the largest number of men fall under the general group of &quot; unsuitable &quot; for training. These men, in the opinion of the investigators, are unlikely to profit by training in a skilled occupation, even if they were prepared to attend.54. With regard to Instructional Centres, also, the summary in Appendix V shows that the large majority of men fall within the group &quot; unsuitable.&quot; It was found during interviews that in general the unemployed men in West Cumberland have not reached a stage of physical deterioration which makes it necessary&apos; for them to undergo reconditioning at an Instructional Centre on that ground alone. Proof of the standard of physical fitness of the Cumberland men is given by the Manchester Corporation Water Departments scheme at Haweswater. These works have recently been resumed and the resident engineer has expressed to officers of the Ministry of Labour his willingness to re-engage West Cumberland men who worked on this job prior to September, 1931. He regards them as fit men physically, and steady workers.55. Clearly a more intensive campaign of publicity is urgently required in order that the fact that work for all will not be forth-coming in West Cumberland may be brought home to the unemployed men in the area. If a clear and authoritative pronouncement to this effect is widely published, I believe that the result will be that the younger men will be more ready to undertake training at the Government Training Centres. Their reluctance to leave Cumberland would be overcome to a considerable extent by the establishment of a local Intermediate Training Centre which would prepare them for more intensive training in the future at the existing Centres outside the area.56. As regards the Instructional Centres, in spite of the fact that young men in West Cumberland seem, generally speaking, to have kept fit physically, those who cannot be transferred to employment in other districts should not be allowed to remain idle indefinitely without some attempt being made to increase their employability.
In the case of the West Cumberland men the mental attitude needs changing. I understand that the conditions of eligibility for attendance at an Instructional Centre at present require the applicant to be &quot; in need of a course and likely to profit by a course and pay for it in increased employability.&quot; I think that these conditions should be more liberally interpreted, i.e., as meaning that men who need the course, not on physical grounds but as a means of improving their mental outlook, should be sent for training, if possible. If persuasion fails, the question of compulsion may have to be considered, though I agree with the view which I gather has so far been taken that compulsion is fraught with danger.57. During my investigation, I visited the Government Training Centre at Wallsend and spent the afternoon watching the training of lads in new trades. I talked to many and in only one case, an ex-miner, did I find a desire to return to the former occupation. This exception may have been proof of the statement &quot; once a miner, always a miner.&quot; As a whole, the young men under training impressed me as being keen to learn and desperately eager to get work. The change of outlook was most marked in the case of lads who had been in such jobs as grocer&apos;s assistant, errand boy, etc., and as one sturdy young welder trainee (an ex-grocer) put it : &quot; This is a mans job.&quot; The quality of tuition apparently leaves nothing much to be desired and I shoidd like to express my appreciation of the enthusiasm and kindliness of the staff and instructors in what must, at times, be difficult work.5S. I also visited four Instructional Centres, three of which were in different stages of development. At Kershopefoot the camp was under construction and the general air and demeanour of the men was most gratifying. Working willingly amid beautiful surroundings on health-giving and muscle-building work, there was no question of lack of interest amongst the men. They clearly took pleasure in their work and many to whom I spoke expressed in various ways the wish that they might long remain there. At Wyhope Summer Camp they were preparing for additional trainees, and here again real satisfaction was found among the men who were getting the camp ready.At Kielder, most of the trainees were out working on different parts of the estate and the few I saw working about the premises did not seem to have the same pleasure in their tasks as at Kershope-foot, but this is no doubt accounted for by the fact that at Kershopefoot the men were largely sent from the Trainng Centre at Wallsend to do constructional work as part of their training and the men at Kielder were the less fit type for which the Instructional Centres are intended. A body of young men I saw at Kielder engaged on breaking stones sang cheerfully at their work and appeared to be happy.
At Hamsterley the surroundings were, if &quot;anything, even more attractive than at Kershopefoot and here again I was struck with the atmosphere of happy willingness to work.In each case I was impressed favourably with the friendly relations between the staff and the trainees.59. If afforestation schemes on a sufficient scale were to be started in West Cumberland and the preparatory&apos; work done locally under Instructional Centre conditions similar to those at Kershopefoot and Kielder, I think that men reluctant to go to the more distant camps would find a local centre sufficiently attractive to induce them to attend without compulsion. It would, undoubtedly, be a pity to lose the spirit which seems to prevail in the present camps.60. Women. The Manchester University Survey Report de-scribed the position of women and girls in West Cumberland in thefollowing words : &quot; Women and Girls. The normal openings for gainful occupation of women and girls in the Survey Region are small and, in consequence, the problem of unemployment does not present the same urgency as with males. Nevertheless, any outward migration of women or girls will help to alleviate the general conditions, partly because there is some unemploy-ment among women which will thus be reduced and partly because the successful movement of one member of a family often leads others to follow the example. The work of the Ministry of Labour in transferring women and girls from the Region is, therefore, striking both directly and indirectly at the general problem of unemployment.&quot; Such placings are not carried out under any special &apos; Industrial Transference Scheme.&apos; They constitute the normal Employment Exchange procedure, but, even so, considerable assistance can be, and is, rendered to applicants who are anxious to move. They are interviewed by responsible officers with the object of discovering the best means of obtaining suitable employment. Where an applicant could enter a post in resident, or in certain cases seasonal, domestic service, but for the fact that she has no uniform, she may be provided with an outfit. Fares may be advanced, at reduced rates in certain circumstances, to applicants taking up employment, and special arrangements are made for their welfare after transfer.&quot;61. The number of women registered as unemployed in the area covered by my investigation was very small in comparison with the number of men, e.g., at 23rd April, 1934, the women &quot;wholly unemployed &quot; were only 499 in comparison with 10,500 men in that category. Although this figure is low, there is a small but steady stream of young women being transferred through the official agencies to employment in other districts, and I agree with the University Investigators that this outward movement is in the best interests of the depressed areas and that everything possible should be done to encourage those who are able to take up work elsewhere to do so. A total of 7S1 women were transferred through the various Employment Exchanges and Branch Offices in the area to posts in other districts (other than &quot; seasonal &quot; posts) from the date when each area was scheduled as &quot; depressed &quot; up to 31st May, 1934.
These transfers were almost all to domestic work which the women in West Cumberland take up naturally and, apparently, in preference to other employment. During the present investi-gation some industrial vacancies in Hertfordshire were made available to the unemployed women in West Cumberland but in spite of special efforts being made to arouse interest in this possibility of transferring to the south, not a single application was obtained. There was, however, at this time a steady outflow to domestic employment, and particularly to seasonal posts at the various holiday resorts in the Lake District, work which is popular amongst West Cumberland women.62. Those who seek permanent posts in private domestic service, but are without experience, have at their disposal the training facilities offered by the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Training and Employment in their residential centres. After reviewing these facilities and the arrangements which are made through the Employment Exchange system to find suitable vacancies for unemployed women, to advance fares to enable them to travel to their place of employment and, if necessary, to put them in touch with some friendly organisation in their new localities, I am satisfied that everything is being done that can be done to stimulate their transference to work in more prosperous areas.63. Juveniles. The Manchester University Survey report stated that-&quot; in many ways, the most disturbing and dangerous aspect of the present position in Cumberland is the almost complete absence of openings for juveniles, which is crowding children into a few blind-alley occupations, endangering their whole economic future, and threatening to produce, for the next quarter of a centurj&apos;, not merely unemployment but a body of unemployable persons who have had no industrial training and no experience of a regular working life, and who have never known conditions under which it was possible to main-tain themselves by their own efforts.&quot; Cumberland, indeed, must always have been in difficulties in placing its juveniles for the reason that many of the staple industries -such as pig-iron manufacture, steel-works and steel-rolling, coke-oven works and iron-ore mining employ an abnormally low proportion of juveniles, and even in coal-mining, where many boys do find employment, changes in the methods of production are making it possible to dispense with them. The post-war depression has intensified these difficulties, and now it is literally true to say that, in many centres in Cumberland, there are no progressive posts at all available for children leaving school.
&quot; Statistics of unemployment among young people up to 18 years of age are unreliable. No official statistics exist of the rate of unemployment among children between the ages of 14 and 16 years, and even in the higher age-groups, numbers of unemployed persons fail to register at the Employment Exchanges and are thus excluded from the official unemploy-ment returns. But, however inadequate the statistics, they support a conclusion which is only too obvious from general observation : that the Survey Region can only offer progressive work to a very small proportion of its younger workers.&quot;64. The Manchester Investigators were writing of conditions as they saw them in 1932, but in West Cumberland, as elsewhere, the juvenile problem has since become more acute by the growth in the number of school leavers which is the result of the increased birth rate after the war.65. In a note supplied to me during this investigation by the Ministry of Labour, reference was made to the fact that &quot; with every school leaving period the pools of unemployed juvenile labour in the depressed areas fill up again.&quot; Not only do they &quot; fill up &quot; ; in many places they increase in size and this is happening in West Cumberland where, in the words of the investigators from Man-chester, &quot; the conclusion seems irresistible that there is practically no industrial work available for children leaving school and that, if they do find employment, it is often in blind-alley jobs which give them little real chance of permanent occupation and no useful training.&quot;66. A considerable number of the school leavers become errand boys with little hope of advancement ; others take up farm work, from which I was repeatedly informed numbers of workers have in recent years been dismissed on reaching the age of manhood ; and the secondary school boy is often found to be in competition with the boy from the elementary school for such jobs as that of a Butcher&apos;s or Cabinet-Maker&apos;s apprentice, etc.67. If, and when, there is improvement in the coal mining industry at Whitehaven and Workington, some additional openings for juveniles will no doubt be created, but, as this and the other main industries do not employ many juveniles, it is clear that there are now, and probably will be for a long time to come, the strongest reasons for encouraging all boys and girls who are fit to earn a. living away from home to make up their minds to do so. Not only is this desirable in order that the young people may have opportunities of entering work which is permanent and progressive, but it is also very definitely in the interests of the older generation (many of whom have little hope of again obtaining regular work) that their sons and daughters should have the chance now of making headway and some prospect ultimately of giving assistance to their parents.
68. The scheme for transferring juveniles to other districts has been in operation in West Cumberland since July, 1929, and the numbers of boys transferred through the Ministry of Labour offices between July, 1929, and 31st March, 1934, are shown below : -	Within North-Western Division.

70. There are no complete records of the numbers of boys who returned home after being helped to find employment in other districts, but the Ministry of Labour stated in its last annual report that about two in every three of those transferred do in fact find a permanent home and career in the area to which they are trans-ferred, and it is believed that the West Cumberland transfers have met with much the same degree of success as those from other depressed areas. One thing is certain, the majority of the boys succeed, and the need for transfer is so great that there should be no slackening of efforts to find work for boys away from home because some have failed to hold down their jobs.71. An attempt was made during this investigation to analyse the reasons for the breakdown of some of the transfers. All the juveniles (boys and girls) from Workington (including the Aspatria, Cockermouth, Harrington, and Maryport areas) from Whitehaven and Cleator Moor who were placed outside West Cumberland by the Ministry between 1st January, 1933, and 30th April, 1934, and who returned to the district were seen (if possible) by an official and questioned as to the reason for their return. The reasons given were very varied. Age seemed to have little to do with failure to settle in new surroundings. Periods of employment in the new district varied from less than one week to nine months. Out of 30 boys who returned only one did so as the result of dismissal due to his misconduct. A few were dismissed for other reasons, such as homesickness, ill-health, and shortage of work (after some months of steady employment), but the majority went home of their own accord because they were homesick, ill, or dissatisfied with their work. Two returned to take up employment one in a &quot; seasonal &quot; and the other in a &quot; casual &quot; job. Fourteen out of the total of 30 boys who returned home had thereafter had no employment at all. Eight others who were idle at the date of the enquiry had had spells of work varying from 2 weeks in 3 months to 3 months in 9 months. Eight were in employment when the special enquiry was made, but the majority had been without steady work since their return to Cumberland. For example one boy had worked 4 &quot; shifts &quot; in 4 months, while others had. spells of work amounting to 1 week in 3 months ; 1 month in 11 months ; 7 months in 11 months, and one had 6 months in S months.72. Unhappily parents and guardians are, generally speaking, ready to encourage their children to return home if they are not entirely happy in new surroundings, but it is greatly to be desired that they should, instead, encourage them to overcome their natural feelings of homesickness and, if at all possible, to avoid return to an area in which so few can hope to obtain permanent and progressive work. The statement which I have recommended in Para. 55, would greatly assist.
73. An interesting scheme to assist boys to get work in other districts was described to me by the Director of Education for Cumberland who established in November 1932 a training course for boys as commis-waiters.  The results of this scheme were good ; the numbers trained up to 31st March, 1934, being as follows :  Number of boys trained in 1932 to 1933 session ..   44 Number of above for whom work was found     ..   42 Number of boys trained in 1933 to 1934 session for whom it is known that work has been found(up to March 31st, 1934)........4The boys who underwent this training were, of course, helped by the Director and/or the Ministry of Labour officials to find employment in other districts.74. The number of girls transferred to industrial employment is small but there is nevertheless a steady flow from the district. The total number of girls placed outside West Cumberland by tin-Ministry of Labour officers from the date when each area was scheduled as depressed, up to 31st May, 1934, was, in fact, greater than the number of boys, being 526 in contrast with 341. The girls&apos; placings are almost wholly domestic and quite a number have been trained at the Home Training Centres, established by the Central Committee on \Vomen&apos;s Training and Employment first in Workington and (after an interval when the district was without a Domestic Training Centre) at Whitehaven. I visited the White-haven Centre which caters for girls under IS years of age, and which offers excellent training facilities to all who are unemployed who live within travelling distance of it.75. The girls who are assisted to find work in other districts are, like the boys, liable in a number of cases to give up employment and to return home for insufficient reasons. The special interviews with girls who had come back to West Cumberland after being placed elsewhere by the Ministry of Labour revealed that the majority gave up their work of their own accord. The reasons for doing so varied considerably. Some were homesick, others stated that they were ill or that their mothers were dl and required them to be at home. Some had had disagreements with their employers; but there were, on the other hand, some instances in which employers appeared to expect more than was reasonable from young and inexperienced maids. The main points of difference in the position of boys and girls seem to be (1) that girls can get suitable employment much nearer their own homes, i.e., within the North-Western counties, while the majority of the boys have to go further afield, and (2) that girls who do throw up their work have better chances of getting other jobs. For example, out of 55 girls who had returned to West Cumberland from work elsewhere, 28 were, so far as could be ascertained, again in work at the date of the special enquiry.
76. Junior Instruction Centre.-It is unfortunate from the point of view of both boys and girls, that there is in West Cumberland no Junior Instruction Centre or Class in which young unemployed people can have useful instruction while awaiting posts in other areas. A small scale experiment was tried of attaching boys and girls during the last three winters to the existing Evening Classes, but the absence of facilities in the day-time was regarded (and properly) by the Manchester Investigators as a &quot; serious matter.&quot; The position as described to me is briefly that, following such modifications to the pattern scheme as the Department could approve, sanction was given to establish a Centre at Whitehaven to serve the areas of Cleator Moor, Frizington, Egremont, Workington and Harrington. Boys registered as unemployed at that date (August 1933) numbered about 300, though there were then an undisclosed number unemployed and unregistered for whom the Centre would be anxious to cater. At the time, and indeed since, the number of boys who could be compelled to go as a condition for receiving unemployment benefit has been small. It was, therefore, necessary to provide a Centre which would not only offer reasonable facilities to claimants to benefit (who could be required to attend it), but which would also attract the volunteer. The Director considered that in the depressed area of West Cumberland, the scheme could only be successful if it provided instruction during 25 hours per week, and also made provision for boys attending the Centre from towns other than Whitehaven to have a mid-day meal. He suggested that the Ministry of Labour should pay a sum of Is. per head to the Authority in respect of each external student, out of which sum the Authority would undertake responsibility for the provision of a meal and the payment of the bus fare. The Department, however, found itself unable to sanction payment of grant towards the cost of meals, this being expenditure towards which the Minister of Labour is not empowered to make grant. Notwithstanding this decision, it seemed towards the end of last year as though the Centre might be opened on or about the 22nd January, 1934, but at a meeting of the appropriate Sub-Committee of the Education Committee held on the 12th January, 1934, the Committee decided &quot; with one voice &quot; that the Centre should not open &quot; without some satisfactory arrangement &quot; being made to provide a simple mid-day meal for those who lived at such a distance that they could not reasonably travel home during the mid-day interval.   The position to-day is unchanged.Under the enlarged scheme of the new Unemployment Act it will be possible to require the attendance at Junior Instruction Centres of all those juveniles who will be &quot; capable of and available for work who have no work or only part-time or intermittent work.&quot; The numbers who thus become available will, it seems, probably enable the Authority to establish centres or classes in three or four areas.   These areas will, however    tdl have to serve outer
districts and the question of providing a mid-day meal for the juveniles in the outer districts who are required to travel some distance to a full day course will still arise. As an alternative to attendance at the Centres boys and girls may choose to remain at school, and if they do so the advantage to them of the provision of meals facilities under the Education Act will remain unimpaired.The Director of Education in West Cumberland, who discussed the matter with me, was forcibly struck with the fact that girls who attend the Home Training Centre, which is established by the Central Committee in Whitehaven and supported by funds drawn from the Ministry of Labour vote, are given a mid-day meal, while unemployed boys (who if the Centre had opened would, in some cases, have come from the same households, and from similar distances) would have been unable to have a meal at the Junior Instruction Centre, the cost of which would have been borne, up to at least 75 per cent., by the Ministry of Labour. I feel bound to say that these differences in treatment seem difficult to defend to the local public, and I would urge strongly that the position be reconsidered.77. As there can be no doubt about the importance of encouraging the transfer of young people from all over West Cumberland (ami not merely from the partially &quot; derelict &quot; areas) the question arises as to how this movement can be accelerated, particularly as regards boys, for whom the employment problem is more serious than for girls. A review of the transference scheme for juveniles indicates that its success depends mainly upon two factors, (1) upon the public understanding fully the need for transference and the facilities which the State offers to boys and girls who are suitable, and available to seek work in other parts of the country, and (2) upon the machinery by which young people are assisted to get work elsewhere being closely watched and adjusted when necessary, to bring it into harmony with the people&apos;s needs.7S. It is quite natural that parents should hesitate to agree to their sons and daughters leaving home in the first years of their working life and this natural hesitation can only be overcome if it is made abundantly clear that such movement is essential if their boys and girls are to have a chance of making their way in the world, and if it is also common knowledge that machinery exists whereby the movement of young people from one district to another can safely be effected. Parents and Guardians, School Teachers, Clergymen and Social Workers generally, Officials of Boys&apos; and Girls&apos; Organisations, Trade Union Leaders, etc., should all know by what means juveniles who are in need of work can be helped by the State to go to districts where work is to be found.
30779. The movement through the Employment Exchanges of juveniles from West Cumberland to work in more prosperous districts almost ceased when unemployment in this country reached its height (i.e., in the latter part of 4931, and in 1932), but the transfers increased again in 1933 owing to two favourable factors, (1) the beginning in and around London of a revival of trade which brought in its train increased demands for young workers, and (2) the fuller recognition in West Cumberland that the Investigators from Manchester University spoke the truth when they said in their report that : &quot; Parents must realise that, in keeping in Cumberland children who are capable of looking after themselves, they are endangering the future of those children,&quot; and &quot; It cannot be stressed too strongly that, in many directions, Cumberland can help itself in the next few years by facing the position, bad as it is, and making it clear that those who do leave the county are helping to lighten the burden and should regard it as their duty to make the utmost effort to succeed in their new surroundings.&quot;80. It will be necessary for a long time to keep before the public the need for young people in the depressed areas to seek, and to be given help to find, suitable employment in other districts and it is recommended that in future wider publicity should be given by means of public addresses, broadcast talks, the national Press, etc., to the plight of the boys and girls in these areas ; to the facilities which are at the disposal of juveniles in the depressed areas (in regard both to training and to transference) and to the desirability from every&apos; point of view of taking full advantage of these facilities. A publicity scheme with such ends m view, would require to be carried on just so long as unemploy-inent was severe and young people in the depressed areas were still hesitant to ask for help in getting work elsewhere. The scheme would also require to be so varied from time to time as to avoid monotony ; to awaken in the minds of unemployed people fresh interest and hope and to quicken a feeling of responsibility among employers who were in a position to be helpful.81. It has been stated by the Ministry of Labour that the procedure for transferring boys and girls to other districts has over a period of years, owing to the growth of the scheme and the efforts made to meet the requirements of varied types of areas and different classes of juveniles, become somewhat dl-balanced and cumbersome. The question, therefore, arises as to the directions in which the existing scheme should be altered to make for smooth working in
the future. Some of the provisions which should be included in any general scheme of transference are mentioned below : (1) Maintenance or subsistence grants to supplement industrial wages should be made in approved cases after the monies from the Lord Mayors&apos; Fund become exhausted. These payments should in principle be met in part by the Exchequer and in part by the Employer as in the case of the existing scheme ; but if the unwillingness on the part of the employer to contribute proved to be a bar to an otherwise suitable transfer, I should not hesitate to provide for payment by the Exchequer of the whole sum involved. Transfer of juveniles is so important and the obstacles in the way so great that strict principle must, in my view, be sacrificed if necessary.(2) The scheme, and the financial help which it can give, should not be limited to juveniles living in &quot; distressed mining areas &quot; but should be available for all boys and girls who have no hope of getting employment in their home district. The Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance stated in its report of 1932, &quot; We are entirely in agreement with the policy of transfer of juveniles from areas in which there is no prospect of employment for them to areas where suitable work can be found.&quot; There should be some simple definition of the scope of the transference scheme. Its benefits should in fact be available to any juvenile who has no prospect of employ-ment in his or her home district.(3) While it is desirable that grants in aid of transference should only be made in cases in which the employment offers continuity of work and progressive conditions, the rules should not be so rigid as to shut out the possibility of giving some financial help to a boy or girl who could be transferred to work which could be regarded as a stepping stone to a better job.(4) It seems desirable that the plan of getting accommodation for transferred juveniles in hostels as distinct from approved lodgings should be developed. It should he helpful to girls and also to boys in speculative transfer cases, and industrial conditions often render it much easier to place a juvenile in a job if he is on the spot. From the West Cumberland Exchanges, 20 boys have been transferred to hostels in London since September 1933, and situations found for them after their arrival at the hostel.
(5) Free travelling warrants should continue to be issued to juveniles proceeding on transfer to industrial employment and the cost should be borne by the State. Similar facilities should be available to juveniles travelling to training centres. The question of giving free travelling facilities to girls proceeding to domestic employment should be carefully examined by the Ministry of Labour. If the employer cannot be induced to find the fare, I certainly think the State should step in with free facilities.(6) There should be made available from the Exchequer, monies to meet emergency expenditure resulting from transfers, e.g., emergencies due to sickness and short time working. It should also be possible always to pay the fare home when it is quite clear that a boy or girl will not settle satisfactorily in a new area.(7) The transference scheme should be voluntary but, as already indicated, every effort should be made by a well planned publicity campaign to bring home to parents and juveniles the need for the movement of boys and girls from the depressed areas.(8) The formation of country camps for the purpose of recon-reconditioning boys who are suffering from undernourishment, lack.of fresh air, or other unfavourable home conditions would undoubtedly be of value and the question of establishing some of them near areas where there is a demand for juveniles should be carefully examined. Such an examination ought to be undertaken in view of the success which has already attended the transfer of boys from West Cumberland to London hostels, there to await interviews with employers. It is interesting to record that in 1933, the Investigators from Manchester University stated in their report upon West Cumberland that, &quot;Given conditions among young persons as serious as those which have been described, it ought to be seriously considered whether transfer should not be undertaken, not in order to place unemployed persons in jobs, but to place workers in localities where there is at least an opportunity of their finding employment.&quot;82. Boys and girls leaving Secondary Schools in West Cumberland have the utmost difficulty in finding suitable openings in, or near, their home districts. The Ministry of Labour has an Advisory Committee with a Secretary stationed at Workington which is known as the West Cumberland Secondary Schools Committee and which exists to give advice and guidance to the children leaving the
Secondary Schools. The Ministry&apos;s officials place at the disposal of these boys and girls all the information which is available in their Departments on the subject of careers and they do their utmost to find employment in other districts for those who are able and wdling to move. The numbers so placed &apos;are few but useful work is, nevertheless, being done as, for example, in persuading Messrs. J. Lyons and Co. (through Ministry officials in London), to send a representative to Workington to select a few Secondary School girls to undergo training for managerial work. The result of this visit was the engagement of one girl as a &quot; trainee in management &quot;, and another as a &quot; trainee saleswoman &quot;, while a third was to be considered for employment later if her health improved. Both girls engaged by Messrs. Lyons and Co., are known to be making good progress.S3. Another gratifying transfer was that of a Secondary School boy of almost 18 years of age who, having been placed as a shop assistant at St. Albans, so impressed the Employment Exchange officials in that town with his good qualities that efforts were made to find him a better job. He was &quot; placed &quot; for the second time as a clerk with the London Passenger Transport Board at a salary of 28s. per week, rising to a maximum of  300 per annum. This boy&apos;s last communication to the Employment Exchange officials in Workington revealed his pride in his new responsibilities and his letter wound up as follows : &quot; Well, I hope I haven&apos;t bored you with my story but just tell those left in Workington that they could not do a better thing than start life down here, because they become in-dependent, they meet new people, and make new friends and altogether their outlook on life is broadened and if they have any push in them at all, they can carve their career for life. Well, I must close now so I thank you most heartily once more for your kind help.&quot;84. There is, however, one door now closed to most Secondary School children in depressed areas which might well be opened and that is the door leading into the Service of the State. The Head-master of the County Secondary School at Whitehaven drew my attention to the fact that boys from his school were unable to compete in examinations for Civil Service posts simply because their parents could not afford to spend the necessary money on entrance fees and upon the travelling and other expenses which are incurred in sitting for an examination in a town at a distance from home. Since this matter was brought to my notice the Civil Service Commissioners have announced that an open competitive examination for the admission of boys and girls to the Clerical Classes (General and Departmental) of the Civil Service will be held in September.   In the provisional list of centres at which the
examinations may be held, Preston is the one which would be nearest for West Cumberland children but as the fare for most children would be in the neighbourhood of 17s., as the examination fee is  2 and as the cost of a night&apos;s lodging would also have to be borne, the child whose father is out of work has clearly no prospect of competing for a Civil Service post, however well qualified he, or she, may be. This is not merely a severe handicap lo boys and girls who have the misfortune to be growing up in &quot; depressed areas,&quot; it is also a loss to the State to shut out from its i employment (particularly in the Departments concerned with the Social Services), young people who know something of the conditions of life in the areas which have carried the heaviest burdens of unemployment throughout the post-war years. I strongly recom-mend that arrangements should be made by which Secondary School children in depressed areas who can give evidence of having reasonably good chances of qualifying for employment in the Clerical Classes of the Civil Service, but who need financial help, should have placed at their disposal grants to enable them to take part in the open competitive examinations alongside children from more prosperous areas.S5. Welfare Facilities. A number of welfare centres which provide facilities for handicrafts, as well as recreational pursuits, have been established in various districts in West Cumberland. The Society of Friends and the National Council of Social Service have been associated in this work and the Y.W.C.A. have been interested in the provision of welfare facilities for women. The Cumberland County Council appears to have helped in every possible way, in particular arranging for instructors in boot repairing, woodworking, etc., to attend at certain centres for a specified number of hours each week to give guidance and instruction to the men in attendance. A statement of the welfare facilities avail-able in West Cumberland is shown in Appendix VI.86. Public Works. Many suggestions for works of one kind or [mother to be undertaken from public funds in relief of unemploy-meiit were put to me. I invariably took the line that what I was seeking was not a mere palliative but something of permanent assistance. In view of the probable revival of coal mining in West Cumberland there would be something to be said for stop gap employment of the type which public works undertaken largely n relief of unemployment have afforded in the past, but, apart &quot;rom the Whitehaven Harbour Scheme referred to in paragraph 19 nd the suggestions in paragraphs 55 and 59 as to possible Training ind Instructional Centres in West Cumberland, I do not feel myself n a position to make any positive recommendations. A complete ist of all suggestions put to me is contained in Appendix VII.
87. Miscellaneous Suggestions. Appendix VII also contains a miscellaneous list (with appropriate comments) of suggestions put to me but not dealt with in the body of the report.88. Local Rates. No special problems appear to arise in con-nection with local rates. The areas are not heavily rated and do not carry any excessive debt burden.89. Local Government Areas. Revision has taken place of the: local Government units and no suggestions can be made for amend-ment. The changes have been in the-direction of abolishing small Urban Districts and amalgamating them into large rural districts. These changes will facilitate application of a general county policy.It will also assist the rehousing of families displaced by Slum Clearance in more convenient and salubrious surroundings.90. General. The picture presented in the Manchester University Report was in certain respects more gloomy than my own enquiries would suggest. This is, however, not due to inaccuracy or to any lack of judgment in the University presentation, but to the facts (1) that the United Steel Companies seem to have definitely given West Cumberland a permanent place in their scheme of operations ; (2) that the change of management of the Whitehaven Collieries has completely altered the coal mining position in that area ; and (3) that gypsum in considerable quantity has since been found in the Whitehaven district. These three factors are likely, as has been indicated, to mitigate appreciably the very serious uriemploy-ment problems of the area. They do not, however, remove them. The agricultural developments which I have strongly urged should serve to lift a section of the unemployed surplus out of the slough of despond. Some development of small industries seems possible. Subsidiary industries like the distributive trades are bound to benefit by improvement in the main industries. Industrial trans-ference will give some further relief. There will nevertheless remain an unemployment problem which seems to be intractable, so far as measures which rest upon local action or impetus are concerned. As the University Report states, the position of West Cumberland &quot; raises questions as to what should be the national policy- in dealing with permanently stricken areas, which far transcend in importance the local problems of the Region under survey in this Report.&quot; West Cumberland is in a sense fortunate that its immediate future seems likely to be less unfavourable than its immediate past. Something can, if the proposals I have advanced are accepted, be done to assist it. Some outward and visible results can be made to follow upon this investigation and this is eminently desirable  it would be little less than a calamity if the investigation should appear to produce nothing of value to West Cumberland. Neverthe-lcss, it is impossible to blink the lact that West Cumberland&apos;s unemployment problem cannot be completely solved by what it is here possible to suggest as practicable measures.
310The existence of an apparently intractable residuum of unemploy-ment is, of course, not peculiar to West Cumberland. It is thrown into greater relief here, perhaps, than elsewhere because of West Cumberland&apos;s isolation and the fact that its remoteness from large centres of population has not encouraged, and is not likely to encourage, the growth of manufacturing industry. West Cumber-land has depended for its prosperity upon the earth and minerals extracted from the earth, and all indications point to this con-tinuing. Iron and Steel must, it seems, remain its dominant manufacturing industry, and, even then, its manufactures will, in large part, be raw materials for industries carried on elsewhere.91. The University Report devotes an interesting chapter to the question of depressed areas and social policy. It advances arguments to suggest that &quot; the State should devote greater resources to continuous intensive research of a regional character and either empower some department of Government to take charge of this work or subsidise independent research bodies who are inclose touch with local conditions.....The State can, and should,.... gauge the prospects of the different industrial areas and set on foot in each area continuous investigation into economic movements, upon the findings of which social policy may be moulded.&quot;   The Report also suggests (1) that &quot; the State should.....play a much larger part in regulating the initial location of new industries or businesses so that, if later they should close down, the chance that they will leave behind them an insuperable unemployment problem will be lessened,&quot; and (2) that where an industry depends upon a local supply of natural resources whose limit is fairly definitely fixed &quot; it ought to be accepted as a principle that preparations should be continuously on foot for meeting the dislocation that will ensue upon partial or total abandonment.&quot;These suggestions raise, of course, issues of national policy which are clearly beyond the scope of the present investigation. In my view, however, (1) there can be no question that the position in West Cumberland will need to be continuously watched for some time to come, and (2) while in regard to coal West Cumberland&apos;s resources appear to be practically unlimited, the same cannot be said about its known iron-ore deposits. The Ministry of Labour and the Unemploy-ment Assistance Board will between them no doubt keep the unem-ployment position under review, but wider enquiry from the angle of employment rather than unemployment will, I believe, be needed than either of these Departments can undertake with their existing powers. The setting up of proper machinery for continously reviewing the industrial position is eminently desirable. One fact which has been borne in upon me by the present enquiry might here be mentioned, and that is the value of local contacts such as are possessed by the Ministry of Labour Employment Exchanges. I was greatly impressed by the intelligence and enthusiasm of the Exchange Managers.
92. In conclusion, I should like to express deep appreciation of the way in which I have been received everywhere in the area. Information was freely given to me by all from whom I sought it. The University Survey had undoubtedly had a profound effect upon local opinion and nowhere did I find anything but a real appreciation of the gravity of the problem and of the difficulties in the way of finding solutions. West Cumberland will be grateful for anything which tends towards relief of its troubles. It does not, apart possibly from a few extremists, expect heroic remedies to be applied ; but it does expect something concrete to emerge from the investigation, and I hope that this will be found to be possible at no distant date.93. I desire to express my most sincere thanks to Mr. S. Warrington (Divisional Controller for the North Western Area under the Ministry of Labour) for the invaluable assistance he gave me. His knowledge, experience, and his complete albeit sympathetic grasp of the unem-ployment problem made my task far easier than it would otherwise have been. For the untiring work and keenness of my Secretary, Mr. J. T. R. Bain of the North Western Divisional Office of the Ministry of Labour I also wish to express my gratitude, as I do for the advice and help which I received from Mr. C. J. Maslin, of the Ministry of Health, and Mr. C. W. Rowell of the Ministry of Agriculture.94. Conclusions. (1) No area in Cumberland can be regarded as wholly &quot; derelict &quot; but the Cleator Moor and Maryport areas come nearest to justifying the use of this term paragraph 7 (1).(2) The worst problems in West Cumberland cannot be treated in isolation. In considering future possibilities and remedial measures West Cumberland must substantially be regarded as a whole  paragraph 7 (3).(3) West Cumberland&apos;s main industries are interdependent to a striking degree and they may become still more closely inter-locked. Iron-ore mining is highly unlikely to afford more employment ; the iron and steel industry offers no prospect of absorbing its surplus labour, but coal mining is likely to afford considerable extra employment in the next few years; minor industries are few and comparatively unimportant ; gypsum mining offers possibilities paragraphs 10-12.(4) There is little prospect of attracting new manufacturing industries to the area paragraphs  13-15.(5) Agriculture does appear to offer possibilities given the right conditions paragraphs   16-17.(6) Afforestation also offers scope for development  paragraph 18.
(7) West Cumberland is likely to have for years to come a sub-stantial surplus of labour with no hope of outlet locally  paragraph 21.(8) The unemployment problem predominantly concerns men  paragraph 22. There is no special women&apos;s problem paragraph 61 but the position of juveniles demands attention-paragraph 63.95. Recommendations. (1) That the Whitehaven Harbour urgently requires attention and that the scheme should be investigated as soon as possible. paragraph 19.(2) That a Development Trust Company (or Companies) should be formed to promote Agricultural and Horticultural Schemes  paragraphs 16-17 and the development of small local industries  paragraph 20.(3) That afforestation schemes should be developed para-graphs 18 and 59.(4) That special consideration should be given to iron-ore miners in connection  with  coal mining employment paragraph 47.(5) That a clear and authoritative pronouncement that there will not be work for all is essential (paragraph 55).(6) That Industrial Transference should be still further en-couraged paragraph 48 that a more intensive campaign of publicity for Training Centres should be adopted and that an intermediate Training Centre should be established in West Cumberland paragraph 55 and that the conditions of eligibility for Instructional Centres should be more liberally interpreted  paragraph 56.(7) That the decision not to provide meals at Junior Instruction Centres should be reconsidered paragraph 76.(S) That everything possible should be done to promote the transference of juvendes and in particular the suggestions in paragraph SI should be followed up.(9) That means should be found of enabling Secondary School children in depressed areas to compete in the examinations for entry to the Clerical Classes of the Civil Service-paragraph S4.(10) That there is need for a continuous survey of the problems of the depressed areas paragraph 91.
POULTRY-KEEPING AT MEALSGATE-A TRAINING TRUST EXPERIMENTMealsgate is a small mining village near Aspatria and depended in the past on coal mining. The local collieries closed down some years ago and left the inhabitants without an occupation. The village, like many others in Cumberland, is of the rural type and the ex-miners have not lost touch with rural life.The village was selected by the Pilgrim Trust as a site for one of their experiments in training the unemployed in poultry farming and was stated in the first place to be an effort to furnish the men with an occupation subsidiary to coal-mining, or as something to fall back on if eventually they had to abandon mining.An attempt was made to bring the scheme within the U.I. Acts and H.I. Benefit and Transitional Payments have, in fact, been paid to the trainees during the past two years, but it is clear that these payments have been made possible only by turning a blind eye upon the requirements of the Act and by what may have been the innocently careless use of words by the sponsors.The Pilgrim Trust advanced  1,200 on condition that  600 was raised from other sources and all told a further sum of  1,189 has been invested by private persons who have been paid 5 per cent, interest.At the request of the Pilgrim Trust the scheme has been administered by three local trustees. The persons concerned give their services voluntarily. One is engaged in farming and has a large poultry section; one is in business in Carlisle and the other is a retired manager of a department of the Great Western Railway.The grant made by the Pilgrim Trust is for training purposes only, and is recoverable after a period of two years.The scheme was started in June 1932. A forty-acre field was secured and ten trainees selected with local guidance as to character and suitability. Under the guidance of an expert and paid Instructor the land was drained and fenced, water was laid on, and roads and ditches constructed. Some poultry houses were purchased ready made, the remainder were constructed by the men under tuition and using the ready-made huts as models. Old bricks were obtained from a disused colliery and a brick food store, boiler house, incubator house, and a hospital for sick birds have been erected. In addition to the day-to-day personal instruction of the Tutor, lectures were given by the Manager and Poultry Expert of the Cumberland Farm School.A supply of birds was purchased but the stock has been increased by incubation and it is hoped to leave each man with 500 birds.Throughout the whole of the period of training the men have shown great enthusiasm and determination to succeed. During the summer months they worked until 8 and 9 p.m.Much of the success has turned on the fact that the land obtained marches with the back gardens of the houses on one side of the village street. The men live at home and no dislocation but rather a further binding of social ties has been effected. Trained in the coal mines to work together, this atmosphere has been preserved in the work they have done,
Feeding stuffs have been collectively purchased from a successful Farmers&apos; Co-operative Society and all eggs, etc., have been marketed through the Penrith Depot of an Egg Collecting Co-operative Society under the National Man Scheme. No formal Co-operative Society has been set up among the men to date, but there appears to be a clear understanding that, once they embark on their own account, if one has bad luck, the others will help him  on paper an unsatisfactory arrangement but in fact one that will no doubt operate successfully with the type of men in question.The scheme has been in operation for two years. It is hoped in the Autumn to hand over the holdings to the men who will then enter on full-time self-employed business as poultry farmers. The Pilgrim Trust will be repaid and outstanding debts charged as a loan against each holder. Because of the free labour put into the plots the value will be greater than the debt redemption price.The most optimistic estimate of returns will not leave the holders with a big income. Thirty shillings to thirty-five shillings per week is a reasonable prospect, but after years of unemployment and having been without prospect of ever re-entering industry, the moral effect has been considerable and the men now have or soon will have their fortunes in their own hands.An income of 30s. to 35s. a week would, of course, definitely remove the occupation of the men from the subsidiary employment category. If coal mining revived in the area, it is unlikely to revive in the near vicinity of Mealsgate and even apart from the income exceeding the statutory figure of 3s. Ad. a day, it is doubtful whether poultry-keeping could be carried on along with coal-mining work away from the immediate vicinity.
MINERS&apos; (INDUSTRIES) TRUST LTD.I. This public utility society was formed by some public-spirited persons in and about the village of Brampton. Brampton lies some eight miles east of Carlisle and was not included within the area of the present investigation because it is not within the derelict category. It might, however, have fallen for consideration had it not been for the success of the Trust.2. In 1928 Mr. Charles Roberts of Boothby, Brampton, actuated by a deep interest in, and sympathy with, the gradually worsening condition of the local unemployed, founded the Miners&apos; (Industries) Trust Limited, believing and convincing others that the area need not decay.3. Capital was raised publicly and such has been the success attending the effort that a considerable number of men have been kept in work and 5 per cent, interest has been paid each year. On 31st December, 1933, the total capital was  22,261 10s. Od.4. The founders were convinced that with informed control many small local industries could be set up or revived. At present the Trustees are responsible for four different ventures.5. Activities. (1) Brickworks have been set up and in spite of recent plant improvements, difficulty is being experienced in meeting demand.(2) The manufacture of Lime is undertaken by the Trust and is progressing steadily, a ready natural market being found among the farmers of South Scotland.(3) Appendix I contains an account of what has become known as the Mealsgate Experiment and the Trust worked here in close co-operation with the Society of Friends;  1,1S2 were raised and advanced to the Training Trust to increase the stock on the holdings and it is believed that this additional capital will make profitable working possible.(4) Small local collieries have been enabled to continue production with the aid of advances from the Trust advances which the concerns themselves would have been unable to raise on the open market. The collieries in question (Naworth Collieries) have extended their operations and when fully developed will produce 300 tons per day for which the Trustees are confident a ready market can be found.In this connection, an interesting example is afforded of the character of the workpeople. On the basis of tales told by their fathers and grandfathers, the local colliers were convinced that certain old workings contained a con-siderable amount of unexploited coal and finally persuaded the company to lend plant and material to certain volunteers who explored the workings, and in the meantime continued to receive unemployment benefit. After 16 weeks&apos; self-disciplined work organised on the usual shift principle, coal was produced and wages paid. The venture is now working successfully and is regarded locally as a triumph of folk-lore over the advice of experts.

APPENDIX VII NOTES ON SUGGESTIONS RECEIVED1. Every opportunity was taken during the investigation to invite suggestions as to ways of dealing with the problems of unemployment in the area. As was to be expected, the suggestions made were of very unequal value. Some were merely temporary expedients ; others, while not without value in, themselves, were of the type which would only be advanced in times of severe unemployment. One at least (the making of a coast road involving amongst other things the bridging of the River Duddon and variousarms of Morecambe Bay) could not unfairly be described as grandiose.2. Roads. The most common suggestions were of course that new roads should be constructed or existing roads improved. Though many of the roads in the County are narrow and winding, besides being hilly, it is doubtful if there is immediate necessity for any more extensive road works. Some of the items in the Councils suggested programme would be likely to arouse acute controversy, e.g., a road over Styhead Pass.3. Catchment Area Drainage. Suggestions were made that more might be done in the way of Catchment Area Drainage, but on enquiry it did not appear that any special action could usefully be taken. Existing powers and facilities are adequate. In any event, the employment value of any such schemes was small.4. School Leaving Age. The raising of this was of course suggested.5. School Buildings. The raising of the school leaving age would necessitate the building of additional schools, but the incidence of unemployment among building operatives does not call for special action.6. Main Drainage Schemes. Some of the villages (e.g., Dearham), have no main drainage and the Parish Council urged that monetary aid should be given to assist this since many of the house owners were unemployed. This -illage is in the &quot; partially derelict category &quot; and I consider that it would on this ground, if no other, be doubtful social policy to grant any such assistance.7. Slag Heaps. Slag heaps exist in several places, e.g., Cleator Moor and Workington, and suggestions were made for dealing with them in some way. Slag heaps do not, of course, add to the local amenities, but are less of an eyesore in West Cumberland than in say, the Black Country. Nature is slowly covering them. They are usually grey and do not stand out so starkly as might be thought. No advantage commensurate with the expense would result from treating them.S. Coast Erosion. On the Maryport coast a certain amount of erosion is taking place and the inhabitants suggested that a sea wall be constructed to prevent erosion and assist in making the town a holiday resort. Any advantage which might accrue would not justify the expenditure of public money upon such a scheme.9. Water Schemes. Prompted, no doubt, by the national water shortage, it was suggested that Cumberland through a National Grid could be a supply centre for many parts of the country. Construction work would yield permanent results, but the suggestion raises large questions of national policy. Thirlmere is already a Manchester Corporation Reservoir and Haweswater is in process of becoming one.10. Aerodromes. Various suggestions for aerodromes were made, but the area does not seem to be of such suitability as to justify any State assistance in this direction.11. Laying Gas Mains and Electric Cables. In Workington temporary work in laying new gas mains to Harrington and electricity cables to Mossbay and Salterbreck were suggested, but in my opinion no case for special assist-ance to this end was made out.
12. Pensions for Older Men. With a view to concentrating employment h the hands of the younger mature population it was suggested that the older men be pensioned.  This of course raises questions of national policy.13. Sharing of Work. Suggestions were made that the work available should be shared among the workpeople either by shortening the working week, working alternate weeks, or employing men from a rota and subsidising the inefficient if necessary. While sharing work may have some temporary utility on occasion, it can at best be only a stop-gap policy. Reduction of hours of work by law raises issues of national policy.14. Domestic Training. It was suggested that when girls left school they should be taken direct into Domestic Training Centres rather than be allowed to remain idle. This suggestion does not seem to hav e any special bearing upon the West Cumberland problem. It has, no doubt, been made elsewhere and already been considered.15. Iron Ore Mining Central Pumping, etc. It was suggested that the mining of iron ore should be placed under one control with consequential benefits from central pumping and concentration of plant and technical research. The tendency of the industry is towards concentration and it does not appear to be a matter for State intervention. There are now only a few mines in operation and the provision of central pumping plant would be uneconomic.16. Use of Haematite Ores. Generally it was held that the superior Cumbrian ore was being driven out by cheaper and inferior foreign ore and that protection was necessary in one form or another. A general tariff on foreign ore was suggested, or alternatively, it was desired that all iron advertised as having been made from Haematite must contain a percentage of Cumbrian ore. Finally, it was requested that all Government orders be lor steel made from Cumbrian ore only. This question will, no doubt, be examined on its merits. It has only a general bearing upon unemployment problems. At best, the iron ore industry is unlikely to do more than maintain its presen-employment value.17. Other Minerals. Cumberland is described by mining engineers as an &quot; amazing place &quot; and it was suggested that the Mines Department undertake exploration for zinc, barytes (with a view to manufacturing Lithopone. gypsum and iron ore. Suggestions of this kind have been previously advanced and no doubt considered. I was strongly urged to recommend that the Government should undertake a commercial survey of the mineral resources of West Cumberland.18. Railway Rates, etc. From almost every quarter complaints of excessive and differentiated railway freights and inadequate services were received. This is a matter for the interests concerned to raise with the Ministry of Transport, and I hope that assistance will be forthcoming.19. Miscellaneous Industries. Numerous suggestions for new industries were made, i.e. : (1) Making of small parts ; (2) aircraft work ; (3) Co-operative Whole-sale Society be urged to set up a local factory, depot or coal mine; (4) manufacture of cement from slag ; (5) textile industry, (6) manufacture of paper, paints, etc. ; (7) tilemaking at Aspatria and Haltwhistle ; (8) use of Cleator Mill buildings for (a) laundry, or (b) bacon factory, or (c) intensive poultry rearing ; (9) brick works at Haltwhistle ; (10) set up G.P.O. repair depot; (11) erect furniture factory; (12) re-establish Brewery at Maryport; (13) ask Messrs. Carr to re-establish Flour Mill at Maryport; (14) lay down Boat Building yards at Maryport and Workington; (15) development of holiday resorts. These suggestions are recorded in order that they may be considered by the Development Trust Co. referred to in Para. 20 where thought suitable.

Derelict Areas Inquiry Scotland (1934) REPORTThe Right Hon. Oliver Stanley, M.C., M.-P., -Minister of Labour.Sir,In accordance with the instructions conveyed to me verbally and in a memorandum, I commenced an inquiry into the depressed industrial areas of Scotland on 3rd May, 1934, and the results form the subject of the following Report.PART ITHE PROBLEM OF INDUSTRIAL DERELICTION 1.  Definition of the Problem and Method of Inquiry1. In the outline instructions it was indicated that the Scottish Inquiry would be directed primarily to Lanarkshire. This has not been regarded as a specific limitation of the field of the Inquiry but rather as a recognition of the vital part the County plays in the industrial life of Scotland and of the importance it must assume in a study of the causes and possible remedies for any industrial dereliction which may be discovered.In order that no case of a derelict area should be left undetected, an initial statistical examination was made of all Employment Exchange areas of Scotland associated with any material industry where the high level of unemployment suggested the possible existence of a locality which might be said to be derelict in the sense that the principal livelihood of the inhabitants has either ceased or passed beyond their reach.Consideration of the available data indicated, at this stage, that the field for further examination of this special problem could be restricted to the following areas : (a) The whole of the County of Lanarkshire (excluding Glasgow).(b) The West Lothian Coal and Shale field.(c) The Ayrshire Coalfield.(d) The area of Cowdenbeath and Lochgelly in Fifeshire.(e) The districts round Falkirk (Stirlingshire), Port Glasgow and alexandria (Dunbartonshire).The total population of the areas covered is approximately 800,000. (14591 C) b2
2. Attention was also drawn to the existence of a serious unem-ployment problem in the Fishing Towns of Fraserburgh, Peterhead, Buckie, Wick, Lerwick and Stornoway. In view of the special nature of the questions involved in these cases, it has been considered desirable to deal with them separately. A report on this special problem is submitted.  (Appendix IV.)3. Unlike other depressed industrial centres, such as the South Wales and Durham coalfields, there has been no publicly expressed opinion to suggest that any of the above areas is approaching industrial extinction and no place within these areas has been singled out as a special example of a fundamental industrial change leading to the social tragedy of complete unemployment. All the authoritative information which could be considered a satisfactory starting-off point for the Inquiry emphasises the important fact that all the principal industrial areas of Scotland have shared in a depression which, until the recent revival, has been progressively serious for a period of years.In view of this common experience it was first necessary to make a careful analytical examination of all the available statistics of unemployment, local government and industry, and to study a large amount of data from official and other reliable sources in order to throw into greater prominence any &quot; blacker &quot; spots.At a very early stage it was possible to conclude that no area large enough to be assessed on the basis of available statistics could be regarded as derelict in the above sense or even approaching dereliction. Indeed, their ability to revive was being displayed at the time of these inquiries by a reduction in the unemployment figures and an improvement in the industrial production figures.2.  Special Surveys4. In an endeavour to discover the possibility of any smaller cases of industrial&quot; dereliction &quot; reports were called for from the Managers of Employment Exchanges in the areas mentioned above regarding any village or small town which had suffered the loss of its single industry so as to leave the inhabitants without any alternative industrial opening in the immediate locality. Such cases were found to exist principally in Lanarkshire and Ayrshire. Special surveys were made in these cases by officers of the Ministry of Labour of all the industrial and social aspects of the local situation and statements were obtained from local officials, traders, schoolmasters and other representative members of the local community.These surveys involved the compilation of special unemployment statistics. At the same time Government Departments, the Local Authorities and other undertakings were requested to co-operate by furnishing any available data regarding these places.
The majority of the surveys were concentrated within the county of Lanarkshire and subsequently included the four Lanarkshire Burghs of Airdrie, Coatbridge, Hamilton, Motherwell and Wishaw. A general picture of the situation in Glasgow is also presented.5. It was found unnecessary for the purpose of the Inquiry to include Falkirk, Port Glasgow and Alexandria in a detailed in-investigation because the preliminary inquiries had failed to disclose any special features apart from the obviously serious depression and these towns had no depressed tributary districts as in the case of all the Lanarkshire Burghs. It should be remarked, however, that they are not necessarily on this account to be excluded from any remedial measures which may be recommended. In the area of Cowdenbeath and Lochgelly (Fifeshire) a special statistical examina-tion was made of the villages of Donibristle and Lassodie, but it was found that their condition was closely related to that of the surrounding district.   Hence further enquiries were not pursued.The reports of the special surveys showed that many of the villages or districts which had been examined separately were in close association, either because of their relative geographical situation or because they were industrially so akin.Summaries of all the reports have, therefore been made with the object of grouping together and presenting composite examples. These summaries are included in Appendix III of this Report, as follows :-*Appendix ELTGroup No.	Villages in Group or District	Exchange Area	surveyed.	affected.Lanarkshire 		IA    ..

3. The Results of the Special Surveys6. The value of the information obtained by the officers who undertook these special surveys fully justified the time involved in making them. The facts obtained afford a considerable insight into the beneficial effect of social services and in many cases an en-ecouraging example of the resourcefulness displayed by those who have virtually been left stranded by the departure of industry in overcoming the worst evils likely to arise from unemployment. In so far as evidence can be obtained, it is, however, often apparent that there is little hope that the departed industry will return in the normal course and permit the inhabitants to resume their former occupations. The industry of which this is principally and commonly true is coal mining. With the exception of Kilbirnie (Ayrshire), the Shale Mining area and Leadhills, all the districts concerned can attribute their serious position largely to the contraction of employ-ment in this industry and to factors such as the exhaustion or flooding of mines.They offer typical examples of a problem of special importance in the Lanarkshire Coalfield.7. In the social aspects of the local situation there are very few-essential differences between the villages and the burghs. The noticeable feature of the situation is the absence of serious cases of under-nourishment or neglect. Most of the more obvious social evils of depression and idleness such as serious mental deterioration and the habits of loafing and disorderliness have only touched the fringe of the unemployed. Indeed a casual visit to almost any of the districts reported upon would not disclose any very obvious outward signs of a serious unemployment problem. In the circumstances it is difficult to suggest that any group is worthy of special study. Particular attention may, however, be directed to Groups IC (Bellshill), IIA (Blantyre) and IVA (Kilwinning) because of certain special characteristics and a concentrated problem of depression.Group IC (Bellshill)This large and populous area, situated in the heart of industrial Lanarkshire and within easy reach of the Burghs of Airdrie and Motherwell, has suffered progressively from the contraction of coal mining and closing of other works, including the removal of a con-siderable part of the activities of Messrs. Stewarts &amp; Lloyds, Ltd., to Corby, Northants. The latter represents an important example of the migration of industry southwards. This area is an interesting example of a district which would be regarded as having all the essentials of a good industrial situation ; such as good land, transport facilities, electric power, coal and water in abundance, and a large surplus of good class labour, both in the immediate locality and within daily travelling distance, which nevertheless is seriously depressed. It chiefly escapes classification as derelict by reason oi its situation in the heart of industry.
4.  The Absence of DerelictionS. Certain over-riding facts have emerged from the investigation which render it difficult to regard any of the districts surveyed as so &quot; derelict &quot; that they present a separate problem of ascertainable size to which special remedies can, with equitj&apos;, be limited.The reduction or cessation of industrial activities in a particular district is frequently followed by the permanent or temporary departure of the working population to other centres, of industry. This movement is amply confirmed by census data, statistical records of the Ministry of Labour and other Departments, and by the this district affords an example of desertion by practically a sole industry coal mining. As will be seen from the summary, However, this cessation of industry is likely to be followed by con-centration of population through the demolition of the smaller villages. The largest village itself (Blantyre) is absorbing the in-habitants of the smaller villages and is itself likely to become more closely related to the Burgh of Hamilton, to which it is already adjacent. Thus it may become a residential portion of an industrial and urban area, and share its fortunes and problems. The survey has also shown that it bids fair to become a centre of agitation and to gain thereby an unenviable reputation which may be detrimental to the best interests of the inhabitants. It is already reported that some employers exclude Blantyre men when demanding additional labour. Thus they do not share in the available employment to the same extent as other similar districts although favourably situated for this purpose.Group IVA (Kdwimiuig)This Burgh, situated rather outside the main industrial field, affords a typical example of the effect of a gradual change in industry. The heavy industries of iron, steel and coal have departed, but it is being partially rescued from a state of complete &quot; dereliction &quot; by developments in the textile and allied industries. This, however, is tending to create a new body of insured workers mainly women and girls without solving the problem of the permanent surplus of men ; thus (as in Galston, Group IVB) reversing the order of things and making the women the principal bread-winners. It is extremely doubtful whether the change can hope to provide a solution, having regard to the relative numbers involved. Even in this case, however, the demonstrated mobility of the workers and absence of isolation renders it difficult to state a special problem, which is unaffected by surrounding conditions.
inquiries which have been made on the spot. The most common form of this movement is daily travelling to employment in other parts of the area ; and one example, specially worthy of note, is travelling by miners resident in hamlets adjoining closed pits to other pits, often belonging to the same coalowners, where housing is not available. Instances have come to light of travelling daily for distances up to thirty miles. Travelling for shorter distances may be described as customary throughout the whole of an area which embraces not only the City of Glasgow, but all the large Burghs of Lanarkshire and the surrounding districts ; in short, the principal industrial area of Scotland. It should be noted that the furthermost extremity of the most distant Lanarkshire Burgh, namely Mothervvell and Wishaw, is within sixteen miles of the centre of Glasgow.Evidence has been obtained from transport: undertakings to show that the extent of this movement is considerable and it may be remarked that all the transport undertakings make special provision for it in their services, including cheap season tickets and workers&apos; fares. The fact in respect of the principal area concerned has also been fully confirmed after consultation with the principal officials of both the Glasgow Corporation and the Lanarkshire County Council.Practically all the villages and -small towns which have been examined because of special local depression are either within the area thus described or within easy reach of large towns and connected with them by regular and convenient transport facilities. Even the Burgh of Kilwinning, referred to above, is not only situated in a rich agricultural district, but is within easy travelling distance of six towns whose industries show signs of revival, and both Blantyre and Bellshill are in the heart of the Lanarkshire area.9. It would be unfortunate if the impression was gained from the foregoing that no problem existed. On the contrary, the whole object of the remarks made has been to draw particular attention to its complicated nature and to the difficulty of selecting any case of dereliction which can be displayed as an example justifying the adoption of remedies without regard to surrounding conditions. If remedies are proposed on such lines they must inevitably produce anomalies and some inequity because a revival in the basic industries in the area, if large enough, would undoubtedly offer the hope of recovery to inhabitants of any part of it. Conversely, depression is a disease which spreads rapidly and widely in such a case and affects the area as a whole. It may be pointed out that this unity of form and interest is not only the result of mobility on the part of labour.The basic industries of Lanarkshire and the Clyde are peculiarly inter-dependent and the sharing of prosperity or depression by the whole area is inevitable on this account.
Hence, in respect of the initial purpose of the Inquiry, it appears necessary to express the view that, generally speaking, no useful purpose is served in pursuing investigation into industrial &apos; dereliction &apos; in Scotland or in isolating any specific district for prior and special treatment. Such a conclusion will not preclude the administration from first developing any remedies which may be adopted in those directions in which there are the best hopes of success, but in any area which is sharing the burden of depression a plan of special priority and arbitrary exclusion in respect of sections of it cannot be recommended as a principle.PART II THE PROBLEM OP DEPRESSION 1.  The Depressed Industrial Areas10. Particular emphasis must be laid upon the fact that the Inquiry has thrown a strong light upon the large and complex problem of the general depression from which industrial Scotland is suffering.It would be impossible within the time limit set for the present Inquiry to do adequate justice to this important and urgent problem, which from an industrial aspect and in respect of a defined area has already been reported upon by the Industrial Survey of South West Scotland (1932).This survey which occupied the concentrated attention of numerous organisations and individuals for a lengthy period deals primarily with the condition and prospects of existing industries and the factors likely to affect the introduction of new ones.Taking into full account all the known factors affecting industrial development and the use of labour as well as the opinions of many authorities about the likelihood of industrial expansion, the survey concluded that a very large permanent surplus of male labour was to be anticipated.The Inquiry which has been made during a search for cases of dereliction has produced much valuable data with a bearing on the larger question, and it has to be said, with regret, that throughout the industrial areas there is ample ground for confirming the exist-ence of a serious problem of surplus male labour.From what has already been said, it must be urged that no part of industrial Scotland can be excluded from consideration, but for practical purposes particular emphasis may be placed upon the claims of the area of South West Scotland roughly coinciding with the area defined by the Industrial Survey (1932) i.e., The Counties of Lanark,(14591C) c
Renfrew, Dumbarton and the sixteen northernmost parishes of Ayrshire. This is a fairly composite area which may be regarded as a single unit.11. It will be noted that this area includes the City of Glasgow as well as many large Burghs and centres of industry. In this connection the present investigation has clearly shown that the lot of those in the urban districts who are unlikely to be absorbed into industry is often far more serious, particularly from the social aspect, than those who are situated in the depressed villages. In the latter case, in the absence of isolation, the unemployed have many opportunities for mental and physical exertion of a useful character which are entirely beyond the reach of those whose true condition is obscured in the more complex life of the city or town. It is also apparent that in the village the obvious industrial contraction of the area has often provided the incentive which has proved the salvation of the victims. This has particular force in an area in which the facilities for movement and change are so unrestricted by considerations of distance. The justification for including Glasgow and other large towns in the investigation is that their burden is increased by the extent to which they attract labour from other districts, invspite of the depression of their own industrial units.It is, therefore, proposed to report upon the question of the genera! depression as it has appeared through the surveys and through information specially obtained by communication and consultation. The information obtained has generally covered the area described above, but it has also included the West Lothian Shale Mining Area and a small area of Stirlingshire (South of Falkirk).It is hoped that the Inquiry made in the present form will provide a useful addition to and amplification of the 1932 Survey, particularly on the Social side, with which the Report did not deal.The Area above described represents a very large part of industrial Scotland, containing nearly half the total population.2. Industrial Situation and Prospects of existing Industry12. Before considering the question of surplus labour throughout the depressed industrial area, it is desirable to bring up to date some of the more important facts relating to the industrial situation and to consider the prospects ascertained by consultation with particular relation to the likelihood of expansion or contraction of employment. These questions were dealt with in a comprehensive manner in the Report of the Industrial Survey (1932).The most that can be done, however, within the limits of time which govern the present Inquiry is to emphasise certain points of first importance which appear to constitute vital factors in the depression and are likely to control future prospects.
13. Undoubtedly the key to the local industrial situation is the fate of the largely inter-dependent heavy industries of coal mining, iron and steel, shipbuilding and engineering.The two essential factors which affect all of them in so far as their employment capacity is concerned are : (a) The general reduction in output during the depression, and(b) The re-organisation which is taking place, without whichthey would be unable to compete in the world markets.Both these points have formed the subject of consultations with the interested parties, including representative employers and workpeople and other prominent persons with local knowledge. There is universal agreement that an increase in production in the basic industries made possible by an improved demand would not, in the natural course, lead to proportionate increase in their employ-ment capacity. This, in fact, is a general confirmation of the findings of the Industrial Survey (1932).14. The improvement which is fortunately now apparent has been preceded by a large measure of rationalization entailing the elimination of small and out-of-date plants, with the object of reducing the costs of production to a level at which world competition can be successfully met. This is equally true of all the industries referred to above and one of the consequences is the abandonment of certain of the districts specially surveyed, leaving a permanent surplus of labour.It may perhaps be emphasised that in making these changes, which have had such a serious effect upon the employment of labour, industrialists have often been directly faced by the alternatives of modernisation or ultimate closing, in spite of the fact that modernisa-tion or rationalisation as commonly understood has certain inherent dangers in that the &quot;load factor&quot; becomes immensely more impor-tant than in the case of the smaller and less efficient plants. It is important to realise that failure to re-organise in this way would have created an even worse unemployment problem. Indeed, as will be seen in referring to the Pig Iron Industry, many of its present difficulties are directly attributable to out-of-date furnaces which are unable to compete against the more modern English and Continental furnaces.In studying the industrial situation, therefore, particularly in industries affected by world conditions, modernisation must be regarded as a beneficial factor, which has, at least, prevented the entire loss to Scotland of some share in the markets open to British industry.15. The question of vital importance is the extent to which markets can be developed to keep pace with industry&apos;s greater productivity. (14591 C) C2
Questions which also assume importance locally are whether the Scottish industrial area is obtaining its clue share of any improvement and whether there are any special adverse factors.16. It would probably be true to say that the key industry in the Scottish area is the Iron and Steel Trade and the improvement which has recently taken place has had a beneficial effect upon coal mining and trades concerned with the transport of the imported ore and the finished products. Undoubtedly, however, the shipbuilding industry on the Clyde is the largest local consumer of iron and steel and a still greater improvement would result from an assured revival in this. It may be said in parenthesis that many ancillary trades with a large aggregate demand for labour would also be lifted out of their present depressed state.The extent of inter-dependence between the basic industries of the area is of particular significance and, while it affords some hope that the effect of any single benefit will be widespread, it also explains the far-reaching effect of the depression which has been experienced.Authorities connected with the various industries have been consulted and information and data respecting the situation in each industry are given under separate headings below.(a) Iron and Steel Trades.17. It is satisfactory to record a notable agreement about tin causes and facts of the present situation on the part of both the employers&apos; and workpeople&apos;s representatives. This adds consider-able weight to the value of such opinions and simplifies consideration of the difficulties.The situation is clearly indicated by the following tables : Year.

The comment is made that &quot; The Engineer and the Scientist have reduced human labour to a minimum,&quot;
18. The Scottish Pig Iron Industry is experiencing special difficulties because, as already stated, it is unable to compete with the more modern English and Continental furnaces. The relative position is shown in the following table. (It should be noted, however, that most furnaces now operating have a higher output since modernisation. Hence a reduction in number does not alone afford a true guide to the contraction of the industry.)Date.	Total Number of Furnaces.	Number Present Month.	oi Furnaces Month previous.	in Blast.

It is stated, however, that much more is necessarv to bring them into line with the most modern practice and there would appear to be a field open for this development in view of the fact that an average of 295,000 tons of pig iron are imported annually from England.19. Recent endeavours have been made by two firms to commence operations for the installation of new coke-ovens. An essential preliminary, however, has been the disposal of the coke-oven gas in accordance with the English practice. It is estimated that the reduction in output costs through sale of the gas at a price materially below the present Corporation cost is from 9s. 6d. to 10s. per ton of
pig iron. An offer has been made by one of the firms (Messrs. Wm. Baird &amp; Coy.) to Glasgow Corporation but this has been rejected. This blow to the industry, if it is not amended, is regarded by all authorities as a matter having serious repercussions throughout the industrial area and urgent action is being taken in many quarters with a view to early reconsideration of the decision. (This matter is more fully dealt with in Part III, Section I.)20. In the case of malleable (wrought) iron there is to be noted a very considerable reduction of output (from 172,000 in 1920 to about 19,000 in 1933) brought about by various causes such as the increase of the differential between Iron and Steel and the importation of very inferior qualities of foreign iron wrongly described as malleable. The employment figure for this particular trade shows an alarming reduction, but it can hardly be called an actual reduction because the principal malleable iron manufacturing firm in Scotland is also a steel manufacturing firm and can to some extent vary the proportions of each material according to market requirements.It is hardly necessary, therefore, to explore the conditions of this particular branch of the industry further, but it should be mentioned that a small increase in production is anticipated and that is all to the good as the man power required and coal consumed in the process are both rather higher than in the case of steel.21. Output depends solely upon markets and in view of the greater productivity, it will be apparent that the demand must rise above all previous levels before the Iron and Steel Trades can hope to absorb their former quota of workers. There is, at present, no prospect of such a drastic change in the situation and both employers and work-peopled representatives are resigned to the fact that not only must many former workers look elsewhere for employment or remain idle, but that the trades will have fewer openings for new recruits.22. In connection with the question of possible work-sharing as a measure of alleviation, a workpeople&apos;s representative stated that arrangements had been made with the concurrence of employers to spread the available work over as many men as possible but that this had reached its economic limit.( ) Coal Mining23. The two principal coalfields in the area of the Inquiry are those of Lanarkshire and Ayrshire and the decline in output and in the number of persons employed is clearly shown in the following tables which are extracted from statistics supplied by the Mines Department.

Authorities on coal mining who have been consulted arc generally agreed that measures taken with the object of re-organising the industry, which are essential for economic reasons, all lead to a contraction in its capacity for the absorption of labour. Moreover, it will be seen from the above table that there has been a large development of mechanisation in the industry and one authority expressed the view that the Lanarkshire coal owners have been almost too progressive in this respect.25. The position in the Ayrshire coalfield is comparatively simple and a large measure of unification of control has been effected, one firm now controlling 70 per cent, of the output. In this case a development of the export trade would undoubtedly have beneficial results, particularly as the facilities for shipment arc adequate. In Ayrshire, therefore, the main problem is that of increasing the demand to justify a larger output.On the other hand the special difficulties of coal mining in Lanarkshire were brought prominently to notice. It was pointed out that whereas in 1913 the Lanarkshire output was 41-8 per cent, of a total Scottish output of over 42,000,000 tons, in 1933 it had fallen to 29-5 per cent, of a greatly diminished Scottish output of
28,000,000 tons. This situation was attributed partly to the depression, but partly to the exhaustion of those coal measures in Lanarkshire which could be worked economically. It is estimated that under favourable conditions the maximum probable output in Lanarkshire is unlikely to exceed the 12,000,000 figure, which is approximately that of 1927. At the same time one must not ignore the fact that there are speculative possibilities of developing the lower coal measures which in all probability exist in the mid-Lanark field but which so far have not been definitely proved. These measures are situated at very considerable depths and the costs of sinking shafts entail a very large capital expenditure which might not be justified unless in the meantime there had been a material increase in the user of coal, such as might result from the successful development of systems of hydrogenation or low temperature carbonisation.26. In searching for all possible explanations of the depression in the coal mining Industry the position of flood in pits was carefully investigated and it was found that the proportion of pits abandoned from this cause was immaterial, in almost every case the abandonment being due to it being no longer possible, for various technical reasons, to continue to work them economically. Again it is frequently stated that private ownership of coal royalties makes the working of a coalfield more difficult than would be the case if all royalties were in one hand, say that of the State. This matter has been carefully explored and the conclusion arrived at is that, generally speaking, no serious difficulty has been experienced by coal mining companies in Scotland, although occasionally points have cropped up owing to the surface boundaries of properties having little relationship to the conditions pertaining in the coal mines.27. The Lanarkshire Coalfield is peculiar, so far as Scotland is concerned, in that by far the larger proportion of the output is used for domestic and industrial purposes. It would, therefore, appear that any development of internal trade is bound to assist this area more in proportion than other areas and while undoubtedly there is every hope of this development proceeding, it does not follow that increase in employment would rise proportionately, chiefly owing to the extensive adoption of mechanical processes. It is estimated that, even should Lanarkshire obtain an output of some 12,000,000 tons, the increase in employment would not amount to more than 12,000 men. It is as well, also, to bear in mind another aspect, namely, that mechanisation calls for younger men, the older men iinding it difficult to keep pace with the machines. Hence the effect upon surplus labour in this industry will be that men above 45 years of age are unlikely to be re-employed and the demand will be almost entirely for younger and more active men. Some mitiga-tion of this situation might arise from the peculiar fact that should there be an immediate and considerable increase in the demand for coal, operating companies would have very considerable difficulty in obtaining the requisite number of efficient miners.(14591C) d

In view of the attention which this subject received during the Industrial Survey (1932) and of the fact that it was not among the Industries directly concerned in the districts specially surveyed, no special inquiries have been undertaken.It must, however, be regarded as one of the vital contributors to the industrial situation in the area. Indeed, it would be impossible without a special survey to do justice to its importance.The extent of unemployment in Shipbuilding and Ship-repairing in Scotland is shown in the following table : Total Number      Increase or Decrease r)ate of Insured     in Numbers UnemployedWorkpeople compared withUnemployed a Month before. aYear before.
29. The situation in Shipbuilding on the Clyde, as in other areas, is being dealt with by a process of rationalisation. It is, however, difficult to assess the relative importance of the permanent con-traction of employment from this cause, as the depth of the depression, relieved only to any noticeable extent by the recent re-start of the Cunarder, has left many large establishments with empty slips. The capacity of these establishments still offers a large field for expansion and it will be obvious that renewed activity on a large enough scale would confer widespread benefits not only on the shipbuilding industry itself but upon the many trades with which it is linked. Although the Iron and Steel trades have grown so as to be regarded as the key industry of the area, it is important to appreciate the part played by shipbuilding in having enabled them to reach their present magnitude. There are, therefore, the strongest grounds for regarding the revival of the shipbuilding industry on the Clyde as of vital importance if there is to be an)&apos; hope of retrieving the situation by direct methods.(d) Engineering Trades30. This group includes industrial undertakings engaged in the manufacture of a large variety of commodities and it would be difficult to assess the employment position in exact terms without considerable examination. Next to the distributive trades the engineering industry as a whole has the largest employment capacity of any in the area. There are a very large number of comparativel)&apos; small firms and only a few really large-scale establishments. Most of these have suffered in one way or another from the depression and so far as enquiries have been pursued there is some diminution in the number of workpeople employed as compared with the period before the depression. Fortunately there are definite indications of a general improvement and the modernisation of industry in this and other countries has produced a demand for new plant and modern appliances which has given some of the engineering firms an opportunity to revive far more rapidly than the other heavy industries. Notable examples are the orders for new locomotives by the L.M.S. and the installation of sugar refineries in sugar producing countries overseas. Some of the lighter engineering firms are also specialising in particular directions where competition is not so keenly felt as in the case of fundamental commodities like iron, steel and coal. Engineering in many of its sections, however, is connected with shipbuilding and while this remains depressed it must have a considerably adverse effect upon the future of marine engineering and the numerous small establishments supplying auxiliary machinery.31. A particular feature of the principal sections of the engineering industry in the area is the manufacture of large plants, special machinery, etc., where production is not so regular as in the(14391C) d2
case of lighter commodities having a large and constant market for which mass production methods have been largely adopted. Many of the firms in this area, therefore, cannot undertake more or less speculative developments and are more subject to the risks of continual fluctuation. Hence they require a comparatively large reserve of labour which they cannot keep constantly employed unless they receive a steady flow of orders. Examples exist in the area of firms which have increased or decreased their pay roll by several hundreds in a few months on account of the receipt or completion of a single order. In such conditions it would be extremely difficult to determine the nature of the effect these trades are likely to have upon the problem of surplus labour. During the lengthy depression some of the firms were obliged to make a large reduction in their labour force. It is interesting to observe that the recent improvement has created a demand for young and adaptable persons who are more likely to be trained successfully into changed methods of production. Many of the former employees of the higher age levels, having suffered from lengthy unemployment, are found to be less adaptable and the skill they have formerly acquired in many cases has now a greatly reduced value.32. An all-round revival in the heavy industries in the area would undoubtedly have a large and beneficial effect on the demand for labour in the engineering trades, in view of the existence of a close relationship. It appears likely, therefore, that the engineering industries cannot alone produce any large effect in counteracting the general tendency of the area to contract on the employment side. A number of interesting examples of the contraction in employment are given in the Report on Glasgow.  (Appendix III, Group VI.)(e) Shale Miriing33. In view of certain special features in the organisation and development of this Industry under the unified control of Scottish Oils Ltd., a special survey of the area was undertaken.In this case it has been possible to-ascertain the prospects of the Industry on the employment side with reasonable assurance, based upon the official records and the information furnished by the General Manager of the above Company.34. The Industry has adopted a scheme of work-sharing under which each \vorker&apos;s income consists of wages and unemployment benefit in combination (3 weeks wage and 1 week benefit) and the average level of wage-rates is maintained by an all-round increase of 12-  per cent, in the ordinary wage scale. The local advantages which accrue to the workers as a result of this scheme are obvious. A further feature which assists in maintaining this situation is the absence of &quot;seasonal&quot; fluctuation in the &quot;through put&quot; of the commodity from mining to the final products. The General Manager has stated that the only change in recent years has been a gradual falling off in the production.
The statistics of output for the Shale Mines supplied by the Mines Department are as follows :-Linlithgow (Oil Shale) in Tons1921 ..	..   1,584,092	1928 ..	..   1,817,2551922 ..	..   2,058,777	1929 ..	..   1,801,3771923 ..	..   2,202,001	1930 ..	..   1,792,3191924 ..	..   2,240,415	1931 ..	..   1,498,7591925 ..	..   1,949,239	1932 ..	..   1,177,0831926 ..	..   1,646,380	1933 ..	..   1,205,7521927 ..	..   1,809,213		35. Unlike the coal mines, shale mining is not materially affected by the adoption of labour-saving devices and the methods of mining used years ago still operate and have been shown to meet the requirements satisfactorily. The future of the Industry appears to lie bound up with the question of protection against world competition, and in the absence of material developments in the demand, its capacity for absorbing new labour appears to be definitely restricted.36. A new development of brick making from spent shalebings has recently been launched after an experimental period, but it is stated that even when a market is obtained, the work would only offer employment for between 50 and 60 boys.37. There would appear to be approximately 700 unemployed workers in the district who are likely to be surplus to requirements. While the work-sharing scheme has undoubtedly effected a considerable reduction in the surplus, the present body of unemployed must rely purely upon vacancies caused by normal wastage or employment in other directions. The report in Appendix III shows that some measure of success has been attained in the latter direction and that there is generally less persistent unemployment than in the depressed areas of Lanarkshire.(/) Other Industries and Trades38. The industrial part of the Inquiry has not extended to a special investigation of the situation in the other industries and trades of the area. Many of these, which might be described as the lighter industries, owe their existence entirely to the heavy industries, notably the many ancillary trades connected with shipbuilding. These, of course, suffer from the effects of depression which have already been pointed out.The main questions for consideration in the case of trades not so closely connected with the heavy industries are whether in the aggregate they are likely to suffer material contraction as a direct result of the industrial state of the area, or whether there is any hope that they will constitute a compensatory factor and assist in its rehabilitation.
39. The largest group of employed workers in the area is engaged in the distributive trade, while other large groups are transport and building. These, together, account for over 150,000 workpeople. Unemployment in their case is materially due to the reduced spending power of the population during heavy unemployment. Furthermore, the area as a whole has not experienced a large growth of population which would cause a growing demand for domestic commodities and services.40. Within recent years there have been notable cases of rationalisation in important sections of the textile industry such as cotton and calico printing. These schemes have all resulted in a large reduction of employment in the area and there have been no important new developments to counteract their effect.The remaining industries do not at the moment show any striking example of a diminution in the labour demand but all the signs are that, in the absence of a general revival, their problem of unemployment is likely to increase.41. It is understood that certain local efforts have been made within recent years to attract motor-car manufacturers and similar undertakings to the area. These efforts failed, mainly because of the more limited market in the vicinity as compared with the Southern areas. Other examples exist of a preference for the South, which clearly indicate the absence of those factors most likely to enable the lighter industries, with a large internal trade, to expand. Hence there is little hope that they can ease the local problem of unemployment and it is only right to say that an examination of any industry or trade of importance in the area shows clearly that its condition bears an inevitable relationship to the condition of the heavy industries.3. Surplus Labour42. Before considering the special position of that part of the unemployed likely to be surplus to all anticipated requirements of industry, some reference is necessary to the unemployment problem as a whole.During the depression the number of unemployed persons has ranged from 20 per cent, of the insured population in the better favoured districts to nearly 60 per cent, in those hardest hit. The average percentage of unemployment for three years, even in the City of Glasgow, has been over 30 per cent.43. The recent general improvement in industry has not favoured the Scottish area to the same extent as many other parts of Great Britain, the relative unemployment position in Scotland as compared
with Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a whole, being shown in the following table : Dates.	Per cent. Unemployed among Insured Workpeople.

Examination of the unemployment position in the area under review shows that in this area are concentrated nearly two-thirds of the total unemployed in Scotland. The Inquiry originally set out to discover within this large field circumscribed examples of depression so serious that they could be said to justify special examination to the exclusion of the larger problem. For reasons which have been explained it has been necessary to regard the area as a single unit.All industrial areas, whatever the state of trade, experience some unemployment and it is a well-known fact that the total of un-employed includes a constantly changing personnel of insured workers who experience varying short spells of unemployment through normal industrial fluctuations. Undoubtedly this is an important and difficult problem, but it is not a feature peculiar to this area and it has, therefore, not been regarded as a function of the present Inquiry to deal with it.The principal concern is with that proportion of the unemployed whose individual spells of unemployment are becoming so lengthy that their hopes of reabsorption into industrial occupations are remote in the absence of new developments.
45. Examination of the basic industries indicates that the normal labour force is undergoing serious contraction, thereby increasing the number of those who may be classed as permanently surplus and unlikely to obtain even a share of the employment available in the normal course.Conditions in industry undergo such rapid changes that it is impossible to establish a &quot;permanent surplus of labour&quot; as an unchanging factor. Some workers may for a lengthy period remain unemployed and then have hope of re-entry into industry, while others, after a period of better fortune, are thrust outside and bid fair to remain there.46. An estimate of the number of persons who can be classed as a permanent surplus, therefore, can only be of service as a means of determining whether the problems raised by unemployment are likely to resolve themselves entirely and naturally within the ordinary cycles of trade or whether there is a material need of new developments and special remedies. In this respect the Report of the Industrial Survey of South West Scotland (1932) is of value. It would be impossible within the time limit of the present Inquiry to make a meticulous check of the various findings in that Report, but many of the facts have been confirmed as substantially correct at the present date.47. It was found that among women no material problem existed and the figures of unemployment indicate a general growth in the employment of women in the lighter industries. In those districts specially surveyed there is a large turnover in the Women&apos;s Register, and the majority of women insured workers may be said to remain within the normal &quot; labour force &quot; of the industries and trades with which they are associated. The remainder generally disappear from the industrial field. Consideration of the problem of exceptional unemployment, therefore, may be restricted to the male unemployed.The total of males over IS years of ago registered as unemployed in the area in April, 1934, according to Ministry of Labour returns, is made up of approximately 124,000 wholly unemployed claimants to benefit and 42,000 other unemployed, including casual and temporarily stopped claimants and non-claimants, making a total of about 166,000.As already explained the totals in each category above include many whose periods of unemployment are intermittent and of comparatively short duration.The total of wholly unemployed claimants (124,000), however, is analysed by the Ministry of Labour to show the length of the periods of continuous unemployment and while this excludes non-claimants and others who may be either in worse or better case than claimants, it affords a rough guide to the proportion who suffer from prolonged
unemployment. Out of the total of about 124,000 men over 18 years of age approximately 60,000 had been continuously unemployed for one year or more.Clearly, therefore, the need for special action is established and it is unnecessary for this purpose to attempt a more accurate estimate.48. It is, however, desirable to make some examination of the composition, distribution and main characteristics of this body of unemployed persons. The reports of the surveyed districts include an age group analysis of the unemployed resident in these districts, and inquiries indicate that the examples are fairly typical of the area as a whole, the variations between them being slight and, therefore, relatively unimportant. The records show in the case of males that the group of those persistently unemployed includes large numbers in all the age groups. Emphasis must, however, be laid upon the preponderance of younger men between the ages of 18 and 34.49. It is also apparent that the problem of juveniles is extremely serious. The National Advisory Council for Juvenile Employment (Scotland) has estimated that, assuming the continuance of the present conditions of industry, the surplus of juveniles leaving school in Lanarkshire over the absorptive power of industry will be more than 13,000 by 1937 and not less than 10,000 in 1940.50. Enquiry has also been made as to the distribution of those suffering persistent unemployment throughout the area under review. In all material parts of the area the proportion of men suffering from prolonged unemployment to the total Unemployed Register is between 40 and 60 per cent. Consequently the special problem of the permanent surplus of labour is one common to the whole area.51. There are undoubtedly many different reasons for the growth of the permanent surplus, and it is important that the main features should be recorded. In the case of juveniles and younger persons, the restriction of new openings in industry during the depression has prevented a large number from obtaining any industrial experience at all. Even in the event of an increased demand for labour, it has to be recognised that many of these young people would be unable to accept a vacancy without some form of training.52. In the case of older persons among the persistently unemployed, they have in most cases become idle after considerable industrial experience. In their case the problem of suitable remedial action is rendered more difficult by the fact that most of them have acquired domestic responsibilities and cultivated other inducements to attach
them more definitely to their present whereabouts and habits of life. It may be expected that a number of these being skilled workers would have some chance of re-absorption into industry without special treatment if there was a large enough revival. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that their skill, acquired under industrial conditions which have altered, has now a much reduced value. Most of the principal industries have been modernised within recent years and have drastically changed their mthods ; hence the principal demand at the present time is for young and adaptable workers who will make successful trainees. It is interesting to note that the Ministry of Labour in its Training Centres has already carried out the experiment of attempting to train these older workers, but in spite of the keenness of the men the experiment failed. One is, therefore, forced to the conclusion that the group of older persons among those suffering from prolonged unemployment cannot be materially reduced through a natural increase in the demand for labour, and many may never work again.53. Briefly the problem of permanently surplus labour in the area Under review might be visualised approximately in round figures as at least 60,000 men and boys. Of these about 40 per cent, could be regarded as a potential labour force for industry after training and as available for possible industrial openings in any part of the country. There is also a group of. approximately the same size consisting of older and less adaptable persons who have acquired skill in particular directions and in the main have domestic and other responsibilities likely to restrict their mobility. In their case experience indicates that their suitabdity for new industrial openings is seriously restricted. Their main hope, therefore, must rest purely upon the revival of the industries in which they were formerly employed. The remaining 20 per cent, consists of older persons possessing all the characteristics of the other group but who by reason of their greater age must be regarded in many cases as verging on the unemployable.It should be noted that the&apos;estimate of the problem made above is intended purely to indicate very roughly the relative importance and size of the problem based upon observations made during the surveys.54. In dealing with the foregoing figures it is right to state that they include a proportion of unemployable persons. This is a problem that has existed in Glasgow for many generations and the present day meticulous recording of all manual workers and poor persons results in this class being included in the general list of unemployed. The figures, therefore, on a strictly &quot; employable &quot; basis might have to bear some correction, but the proportion may be regarded as negligible for the purposes of the Report.
55. In view of the widespread depression and the extent and distribution of the persistently unemployed surplus, it would be reasonable to expect some signs of distress, general physical deterioration or serious restriction of local amenities. It is, therefore, a matter of considerable satisfaction to record that a large majority of the general body of unemployed are bearing their lot with fortitude and patience and exercising their powers in main-taining their self-respect and in finding some form of activity to fill in the enforced leisure. It cannot, of course, be denied that many unsatisfactory features have been observed to which it will be necessary to make some reference, but these must assume proper proportions in relation to the many encouraging signs as to the effect of social services in obviating the more material evils of depression.Some study has been made, therefore, of social conditions with a view to ascertaining whether special attention is required to any particular feature.(a) Housing and Health56. The latest information available as well as personal observa-tion show that much still needs to be done to effect slum clearance and to eliminate overcrowding, but it is satisfactory to note that new housing developments have either commenced or have been planned even in the most depressed districts visited.The Department of Health for Scotland and the Local Authorities have provided details of the housing programme for the five years 1934-193S and examination shows that there is a common endeavour to make a large provision for the necessary improvements.In the matter of encouragement of new Schemes little outside influence appears necessary in view of the attention the subject is receiving from the Department of Health for Scotland and the Authorities.The salient feature of the situation viewed generally is a policy of demolition of the small &quot; decayed &quot; village, and concentration in more suitable areas. Although no doubt swayed in their policy by considerations of economy, the Local Authorities appear to have acted wisely, having regard to present conditions, in refusing to rebuild in parts of the area which are comparative!y isolated and do not offer any hopes of immediate local employment.The investigation which has been made during the Inquiry shows that progress with re-housing in the Burghs is also general.57. As a general rule the new houses in all districts are well spaced and even in the &quot; unemployed &quot; areas are well kept, but unless some preventive measures are taken there appears to be a danger of overcrowding through sub-letting by unemployed persons as a means of assisting in rent payments. This question is related to the scale of rental charges. In most of the areas specially surve3&apos;ed, rentals for Council houses are low and unemployed tenants obtain relief from rates.   The average rentals for new Council houses (slum
clearance) range from  12 to  24 per annum according to accom-modation and there are only slight differences between one district and another. Some special reduction of rental charges is also stated to have been made in the case of unemployed tenants. Arrears in payment of rent and rates are a common feature throughout the depressed area, but the dimensions do not call for special comment or suggest exceptional difficulty. In certain cases an improvement in this respect is stated to be obtained by the introduction of a system of weekly payment including both rent and rates.The information collected relates mainly to Council houses, but many of the unemployed not so housed live in houses erected by colliery and other companies where the scale of charges is usually reasonable.There is, of course, a large amount of privately-owned property in respect of which general information could not be obtained.The policy of concentration referred to above does not always, however, commend itself to the people. For instance, the Chief Housing Inspector of the Department of Health for Scotland has quoted examples of villages (e.g., Quarter, Auchenheath) where the villagers in the absence of industrial employment, would prefer to remain in their present situation and develop agricultural pursuits.From a housing point of view the dominant factor appears to be the cost of sewage works, and availability of transport facilities.58. The general health of the unemployed and their dependants is good, and no instances of under-nourishment or defective physique which may be attributed directly to the depression have been observed in any part of the area of the survey.(b) Clothing and Food59. In all parts of the area, traders report that there has been a general fall in trade in domestic necessities, while a lower quality than formerly is also being purchased. Some of the larger traders have adopted a &quot; cut-price &quot; policy in an endeavour to meet the changed economic circumstances of the working population. This is more noticeable in those districts where the unemployed are in the majority, and, in consequence, it has tended to place the small community in a relatively better position. It is one further explana-tion of the observation already made that the conditions of the unemployed in the village are sometimes better than those of their fellows in the Burghs. This, however, does not niean that the position is entirely satisfactory in any case, and it is true to say that many of the evils of unemployment such as under-nourishment and raggedness have only been avoided by good management and most careful spending. Evidence that the more direct evils of unemployment have been avoided is furnished by the condition of the school children, to which special reference is made in the reports on Glasgow and the Lanarkshire Burghs (Appendix III).** Not printed.
(c) Activities of the Unemployed60. A very important feature of unemployment from a social aspect is undoubtedly the absence of occupation. Particular attention has, therefore, been paid to the more common pursuits in which unemployed persons in the area indulge. Mere loafing is compara-tively rare, but the enquiries indicate that betting and gambling are popular, no doubt because of the element of chance and excitement it brings into an otherwise uneventful existence.Many of the working class houses have gardens or. are situated close to available land, except, of course, in the congested parts of the Burghs. The cultivation of vegetables is, therefore, a common form of activity.   (See also paragraph 65 below.)The question of activities is important, mainly because of the effect upon the mental outlook of the unemployed. It may be remarked that undesirable features are usually of a minor character and the social behaviour of the unemployed is deserving of the highest praise.(d) Voluntary Social Service to assist the Unemployed61. Even a general sketch of the social aspects of unemployment would be incomplete without reference to the Social Service schemes which are being developed throughout the country.The schemes relating to the area under review are co-ordinated, for the main part, under the Scottish Council for Community Service during Unemployment, the Glasgow Council for Community Service in Unemployment, and other Regional Councils, and in the case of allotment schemes, the Society of Friends and Scottish National Union of Allotment Holders.62. According to available data, just under 24,000 men and about,000 women, out of the total of over 300,000 persons unemployed inScotland as a whole are enrolled as members of the purely Club typeof activities, and the average daily attendance is usually about halfthe membership.   A very high proportion of the persons concernedmake use of facilities for reading, recreation, and amusement.  the types of schemes adopted in Scotland with the approximate numberof persons enrolled are shown in the following table. (The estimaterelates to 31st March, 1934.) &apos;       1JL.     .    ,&apos; ApproximateMembersliip.Type of Scheme.	Men.

63. Most of the schemes owe their origin to local initiative influenced in some cases by the co-ordinating Councils, but in the case of Physical Training, a number of schemes originally started by the Ministry of Labour have later been taken over by the voluntary organisations.64. It has been stated in Glasgow, with approximately 100,000 unemployed, that a secretariat for the co-ordination of all community service schemes could probably be set up to perform all the necessary-administrative duties at a cost of approximately  2,000 per annum. The provision of such a fund centrally would release all existing local resources for the establishment and maintenance of centres without deduction. On a pro rata basis, the sum required annually to set up an approved administrative machine throughout the country, assuming the unemployed to total a million, would be  40,000.65. The activities of the Society of Friends and Scottish National Union of Allotment Holders have made a contribution of immense value to the well-being of the unemployed, and the results present a striking example of a palliative which has directly rehabilitated the unemployed by providing both mental and physical benefits. Certain industrial firms, Local Authorities, etc., have also recognised the value of this activity and have provided land and other facilities for its development. There is, however, an unsatisfied demand in many-parts of the area, particularly in the Burghs where land is not so readily obtainable, and the removal of this difficulty would undoubtedly be followed by a considerable growth of allotment cultivation. The special arrangements made for payment of rent, purchase of seeds, tools, etc., are of great advantage and obviate many of the special difficulties likely to be encountered by the&apos; unemployed holders.66. Mention must also be made of the fact that many of the Education Committees, either in conjunction with Social Service bodies or directly, provide special facilities for the unemployed in the matter of continuation classes, and in Glasgow, most of the principal Colleges, such as the Technical College, Art and Domestic Science Schools, have special free classes.67. Many of the smaller communities, however, still appear to have little or no provision, and there is, therefore, considerable scope for a general extension of every form of activity of this nature in view of the large body of labour of all ages likely to remain without wage-earning employment. It is only right to say that while there seems to be ample voluntary personal service in connection with these schemes, funds for essential administrative purposes are not over-plentiful.
PART III REMEDIAL MEASURES1. The Industrial Development of the Area6S. In view of the contraction in the employment capacity of the existing industries, attention must be given to the questions of stimulating these and the introduction of new industries. These matters in respect of Scotland as a whole are among the aims of the Scottish National Development Council which was set up in 1933. Unfortunately the new industrial developments which have been taking place within recent years indicate a general preference for the South. Careful examination has been made of the Report of the Board of Trade Survey of Industrial Development, 1933, for any material reason to explain this fact.In Scotland, in 1933, 14 new factories opened while 29 were closed, and for Great Britain as a whole, 463 new factories opened while 409 closed. The employment afforded by the new factories was 29,500, while the contraction of employment through the closing of factories cannot be stated. It is apparent, therefore, that the amount of new employment directly afforded by the development would not in itself have contributed materially&apos;to a solution of the principal Scottish problem. At the same time the indirect effect of such development is likely to be considerable and on this account the relative position of Scotland must be a matter of concern.69. There are no doubt many industries whose operations are not materially affected by the presence of natural resources and these have a wide choice in the selection of the area of operations. Freedom of choice has undoubtedly been extended by the wide distribution of cheap power. In these cases, however, other considerations such as proximity to markets then assume greater relative importance. Such facts are inevitable consequences of the competitive conditions under which industry has to operate. Thus any artificial direction of industry would probably prevent development.It may be said that certain industries operate as easily in one area as another, and that the reasons for the selection of a particular site in certain cases may almost be described as frivolous. But this is hardly likely to apply to industries which require a considerable labour force.70. Attracting industries, however, is quite a different matter, and that could chiefly be done by making known to those likely to create new industries the actual position as regards availability and quality of labour, incidence of rating, cost of power, and efficiency of transport. In all these respects the area under review can compare favourably with most other industrial districts ; the previously existing handicap of high local rates having been largely mitigated
by the Derating Act. Further, a belief very commonly held that labour in the Clyde area was turbulent and undisciplined is now generally known to be untenable. All chese matters are being energetically dealt with by the Scottish National Development Council and even by Local Authorities themselves.71. At this stage it might be desirable to deal specifically with one instance where the Local Authority has definitely failed to give that measure of support to a development scheme which has wide potentialities for good. I refer to the Baird offer of gas to the Corporation of Glasgow.&apos; This matter has been very carefully explored. In a few words, it arises from an effort by this firm (Messrs Wm. Baird &amp; Co.) to modernise their coke ovens at Coat-bridge in order to enable them to compete in the pig iron market against outsiders. An interesting point arises in that under the circumstances prevailing at the present time the firm is actually able to produce pig iron at competitive prices owing to two special circumstances. These circumstances are (1) that owing to market conditions they are able to purchase ore at what is undoubtedly an uneconomic price to the ore producers ; and (2) that owing to the depression in the shipping industry, they are enabled to get the ore transported at a figure which is entirely uneconomic from the point of view of the shipowner. These peculiar circumstances are tending to and will in all probability shortly change. The firm in question, looking to the future, desires to erect a really up-to-date cokingplant, but to make this economic, they must be able to dispose of the resultant gas at a reasonable price. The only reasonable price obtainable is to be had through sale for domestic consumption,and that domestic consumption in the city of Glasgow is catered for by the Corporation. This is the only gas undertaking in the West of Scotland of sufficient size to absorb the large volume of gas which would be produced from the proposed plant: the demand for gas within the whole of the remainder of Lanarkshire falls short of the necessary volume by about 30 per cent, throughout the summer. As far as can be ascertained, the price offered for a daily supply of some six million cubic feet is materially below the cost of production to the Corporation, and on that basis represents a saving in the ulti-mate price of the pig iron of something in the region of 10s. per ton. It is interesting to note that in order to have available that quantity of gas which is entirely suitable for domestic consumption, there is required daily six hundred tons of coal, eight hundred tons of ore and limestone producing four hundred tons of pig iron, representing in various capacities an employment basis of somewhere between 2,500 and 3,000 men. When it is realised that a contract of this nature entails to begin with a capital outlay on new plant of about  500,000, and an undertaking by the firm in question to maintain this supply of gas over a period of years without reference to their sales of this large quantity of pig iron, and at a fixed price regardless
of any increase in the cost of raising coal, it will be realised that a very big responsibility is being undertaken and one which could only be envisaged by an organisation with very considerable capital resources and technical ability of a very high order.It is of interest to note that Glasgow is practically the only large city associated with the iron industry which makes no use of coke oven gas ; other large cities taking a very high proportion of this type of gas from local works, in some cases even their whole requirements.Finally, it is right to say that the matter has been explored with meticulous care to see if there were any possible adverse circum-stances from the municipal point of view and it has not been possible to discover any. It is necessary to emphasise this matter, particularly because there is a possibility of a very material restor-ation of this industry in the Lanarkshire area if the Corporation of Glasgow can be induced to take a broad view and assist in the way indicated.In the meantime, owing to the lack of an outlet for the coke oven gas, Baird&apos;s modernisation plans are completely held up.72. While I am of opinion that the direction of industry in the sense of coeicion by the Government as to the place where new industries may be started is for reasons already stated definitely unsound, I still think that the Government could do something to alleviate the specially difficult situation in this important area by recognising that it has been built up almost entirely on the basis of the heavy industries, and that the interaction between them is so material a feature that the improvement of one of them vitally affects the remainder. I believe I am justified in suggesting that a designed direction of Government orders in rather larger proportions than of recent times to the Clyde area would alleviate in a remarkably wide degree and out of proportion to what it would do in other areas, the widespread and severe conditions of depression which exists therein.2. Industrial Transference and Household Removal73. In an area which has been suffering for a lengthy period from a serious industrial depression, it is to be expected that a large number of persons would have been transferred out of the area under the official schemes of Industrial Transference and Household Removal, which have been in existence since 192S. It has already been seen that a large proportion of the permanent surplus of labour might be regarded as suitable and available for transfer, and emphasis was laid upon the fact that in the County of Lanark alone there is an exceptionally large surplus of juvenile labour. In spite of this, transference up to the present date has played only a small part in alleviating the local unemployment problem. It is also understood that a large proportion of the industrial transference so far effected
has been from Lanarkshire to districts such as Glasgow, which arc officially classified as not depressed. Suoh transfers, however, involve only a minor change and are in fact nothing more than assistance in finding work in another part of what is organically a single industrial area. In such cases the transferee travels daik from home to work and undergoes no vital change in his social life. While such movements of labour within an area are healthy and mobility is undoubtedly to be encouraged, they cannot be regarded as a contribution to the solution of the problem of depression under consideration unless the part of the area to which transfer is effected has avoided the general depression. Many persons have been consulted on this point and there is general agreement that the City of Glasgow forms the centre of a single depressed area and shares its burdens to a very material extent.74. In the case of the small number of transfers which have been effected to places outside the area under review, it is understood that these have always been to specific vacancies, often in the occupation previously followed, which it must be assumed are to rectify actual shortages of labour in the new area. An important example of a large scale transfer and household removal has resulted from the removal of Messrs. Stewarts and Lloyds from Bellshill to Corby, Northants.75. The transfer policy as defined in the Report of the Industrial Transference Board, 1928, appears to envisage a scheme for levelling out unemployment throughout the country, in which the transferee undertakes a certain amount of risk and is not always assured of the same conditions of employment or permanency in the work to which he is transferred. No doubt the very limited extent of industrial transference so far results from the fact that the oppor-tunities have been few and the question of whether these oppor-tunities can be extended is not one with which it is possible to deal locally. In these circumstances attention has been paid to the likely attitude of surplus labour in the area under review to the first essential of the transfer policy as stated by the Industrial Trans-ference Board, that is &quot; realisation by unemployed persons themselves of the stark realities of the situation and resolution to try a fresh start elsewhere.&quot;76. In spite of the undoubted benefits conferred upon the com-munity by the development of such services as Unemployment Insurance, the mere fact that they have removed the worst features of necessity appears to have had some effect in creating a lack of enthusiasm for drastic changes which involve some measure of risk. Willingness to transfer appears generally to be limited to cases where the opening is closely related to the former occupation and where there is a definite prospect of permanency. As an illustration of the absence of a spirit of adventure, it may be stated that un-employed boys in the area were recently given an opportunity of
training for the Merchant Service at the Gravesend Sea School, but the response to this opportunity was extremely disappointing. The more material difficulties were overcome by arrangements for the payment of fares and a small fund raised by the Lord Provost of Glasgow was placed at the disposal of the Ministry of Labour to assist in bearing the initial cost of the outfit. Work in the Merchant Service at the end of the period of training was practically guaranteed, but in spite of this there were practically no acceptances out of some hundreds of boys and parents who were interviewed. While some natural objection to service at sea may be expected, this experience undoubtedly illustrates the difficulty of convincing the persons con-cerned of the advantages, if not the necessity, of transfer where it involves any real change of surroundings or occupation.77. In transfers already affected, it is understood that on the termination of the employment in the new area, a large proportion of the transferees eventually return home. The movement to and from the Lanarkshire Burghs on this account has been recorded in Appendix III, Group III.* Such a movement largely nullifies the main advantages of the transfer policy. Moreover, it suggests that the new area has been unable to attract the transferee and this may adversely influence other prospective candidates. It would appear from the above that the machinery requires some strengthening, financial or otherwise, in order to assist the transferee in establishing permanent residence in his area of migration.78. During enquiries which have been made with the definite object of ascertaining in what way the permanent surplus in the area would react to a development of industrial transference, it has been stated that some objection to transfer rests upon the fact that there is a loss to the income of the family from public funds through the departure of the transferee. This point, which has a more direct bearing upon residential training, is referred to under Part III, Section 3.3.  Training and Reconditioning79. During the course of the Inquiry,- visits have been paid to all the Training and Re-conditioning Centres operated by the Ministry of Labour in Scotland.These centres, in their particular ways, perform a valuable service either in vocational training for employment or in the rehabilitation of those suffering from the effects of lengthy unemployment.The number of trainees at Springburn Government Training Centre, Glasgow, is necessarily restricted with a view to ensuring that each trainee will be placed into employment without difficulty. While on social grounds one would be disposed to recommend a large development of a scheme which is so obviously advantageous to many young men, it has to be recognised that its success is con-tingent upon the successful placing of the large majority.* Not printed.
While it is understood that opposition was experienced at one time, this appears to have largely disappeared and the number of applications is usually in excess of the vacancies. During the special surveys universal approval of this scheme was expressed, and it is a piece of constructive work the value of which should be more generally recognised and widely known.In view of comments to be made about other schemes it is par-ticularly observed that this is a non-residential centre.80. The domestic service training centre at Millersneuk, Lenzie, operated by the Scottish Committee for Women&apos;s Training and Employment, represents another example of direct, though small, easement of the unemployment position.   The centre is conducted on sound practical lines and the only disappointment was that it was not filled to capacity.   It was understood that the Employ-ment Exchanges throughout the area had great difficulty in obtaining applicants for training. Naturally, careful selection is necessary and only a proportion of the younger unemployed women are suitable for such training, but even when allowance is made for this fact and the smaller amount of unemployment among women, it is a matter of surprise that women cannot be found to fill the com-paratively small capacity of the centre.The Principal stated that apart from the conscientious dislike ol domestic service which still exists, she had experience of accepted applicants for training who had failed to report. Enquiries showed that this failure was clue to the realisation that the departure of tin applicant from the household in which she resided would involve; loss to the total family income by reason of the non-receipt of th benefit or transitional allowance. (The amount being largely diverted for the maintenance of the applicant at the Centre.) This facto appears to be one of general importance and during the individui surveys it was found to be the principal reason given for tli unpopularity of all the residential centres.81. The reconditioning centres at Carstairs, Glenbrante Ballameanoch and Glenfinart were all only slightly below full strong at the time of the visits, but it was understood that recruitment h; not been confined entirely to depressed areas.The same &quot; family income &quot; difficulty was commonly referred as in the case of domestic training.82. Unlike the training centres, the reconditioning schemes not offer any positive inducement on the ground that they lead employment.  Their purpose, which is undoubtedly well-perfornu is to repair the mental and physical ravages of lengthy unemploynu-Furthermore, they do directly improve the employability of trainee and occasionally enable him to compete successfully ordinary wage-earning employment.Considerable publicity of an undesirable kind is given to effort at rehabilitation by organisations whose intentions are entii
subversive of the present order of society and who, in order to achieve their real purpose, adopt the suggestion that the schemes perform essential work under &quot; slave &quot; conditions.It is perhaps one of the most unfortunate features of the scheme at Carstairs that the activities are confined largely to &quot; making holes and filling them in again.&quot; Equally it is one of the features of the Gfenbranter group of centres that the work is performed for some definite, though remote, purpose.83. It is apparent that the officials and instructors at all these centres are well aware that their job is the salvation of the men and not the output of the job, and the large majority of the trainees fully realise the advantages being conferred upon them and show a definite reaction to the joy of having work to do, accompanied by good quarters and generous and attractive dietary.Realising, as one is forced to do, the industrial background against which such valuable labour is being re-conditioned, it is a matter of real regret that at the end of the course many of the men must return to their former condition of idleness.84. In view of the changes to be effected under the provisions of the New Unemployment Act in the case of juveniles, it would have served no useful purpose at this stage to have studied the question of Junior Instruction Centres. Many of the points observed in the case of adults, however, apply with etpial force to the juvenile surplus.4. Land85. In all times of industrial crisis with concomitant heavy unemployment, attention is invariably directed to the question of how far the reclamation, improvement and utilisation of land can contribute to the alleviation of widespread depression.The present depression, owing to its length and severity, compels special consideration of this matter, having regard to the fact that the Lanarkshire area is faced with so large a permanent surplus of labour consisting of many men of an age which will militate against their being able to re-enter the heavy industries owing to various circumstances previously indicated.86. Land reclamation offers a considerable field for the employment of labour, but in view of the fact that reclamation schemes are, with few exceptions, not strictly economic in the sense that, while they may produce land suitable for agricultural purposes, this is generally achieved at a disproportionate cost per acre, and they have to be regarded, more or less, as relief work. There are, however, certain exceptions, and reference is made to a most interesting suggestion put up to the County Council of Lanarkshire in the Carstairs area. (No. 3 District of the County.)87. Land improvement, particularly in regard to drainage, is another field which might provide an opening for employment.  The epartment of Agriculture have at different times operated a number
of Land Drainage Schemes with ranging rates of Governmental contribution, and it is understood that considerable use was at ont. time made of these. They appear to have been gradually dwindling, probably because of a progressive reduction in the proportion of cost contributed by the Government, certainly not from lack of land, particularly sheep grazing in the Highlands, immense areas of which are crying out for such treatment.88. Land utilisation is a large subject, but for the purposes of this report only certain aspects need be considered.There has existed in Scotland for many generations a demand for settlement on the land in various ways and this demand has never been satisfied. The form in which it has been dealt with generally is the provision in the arable areas of miniature farms of normal type calling for a considerable capital outlay in buildings and equipment, and let usually at an uneconomic rental which may take the form of a direct rent or an annuity based on a low rate of interest on the capital cost. The conditions prevailing in the Highlands and Islands present an entirely different problem which need not be considered in this connection.89. Recently the Department of Agriculture has paid more attention to the provision of a smaller type of holding, still, however, fairly lavishly equipped, and the considerable measure of success attending this development has probably been caused by their being generally situated fairly close to large consuming centres, and also to the measure of protection given to the commodities most usefully raised on these holdings. Finally, it has commenced most useful experiments on quite small plots \ to 2 acres, with no equipment at all in some cases, not even fencing. In all, some 582 acres has been leased, and this area has been let to 764 men as shown in the following table :-County.	No. of Centres.	Total area. (Acres)	No. of men to whom plots have been let.

Further, a very generous gift of a large farm in the immediate neighbourhood of Dundee is to be administered by the Department chiefly on the lines of the provision of small plots. Obviously as these plots are normally purely for cultivation and not residence, they must be within reasonable distance of the dwellings of the cultivators. The results so far obtained are most encouraging and the system may be said definitely to have passed the experimental stage.90. Allotments in the strict sense of small areas of not more than one-sixteenth of an acre must be mentioned to complete the picture. Generally speaking, the development of allotments in Scotland is comparatively recent, and even yet has not reached anything like the proportionate extent to what it has in England. During the Great War Scotland made its first real effort at allotments, and during the immediate post-war years the effort rather languished, but present circumstances have given it a new impetus. Too high praise cannot be given to the joint work of the Scottish National Union of Allotment Holders and the Society of Friends, whose labours have resulted in hundreds of men, unwillingly compelled to experience long periods of unemployment, being able to keep them-selves fit, maintain their self-respect and make no mean contribution to the feeding of themselves and their families.PART IVCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS91. It will be seen from the earlier parts of the Report (para-graph 8) that I was at a fairly early stage of the Inquiry forced to the conclusion that the problem in Scotland was not one strictly of Derelict Areas in the sense that it was impossible to find areas so industrially derelict and geographically isolated as to call for special treatment in greater measure than would be applicable to the whole of industrial Scotland.92. Preliminary investigation indicated the desirability of ex-amining in closer detail and from every aspect the Burghs, villages, and rural areas in Lanarkshire and parts of Ayrshire, Stirlingshire, and West Lothian so as to be able to present an accurate picture of the situation as it exists to-day, and there are attached to this Report appendices* giving this information.93. At one stage it was suggested that the Fishing Ports in N.E. Scotland could almost be classed as derelict, but examination of these indicated that it would be difficult to do so and the matter was, therefore, not further pursued especially in view of the fact that the conditions in these ports were under review by the &quot; Fish Commis-sion.&quot; Certain interesting information was accumulated and is to be found in Appendix IV.
94. Attention has been chiefly concentrated on the Industrial Belt of Scotland and this fell naturally into certain well defined divisions.(1) Shalefields. The Shale Oil Industry which covers a wide area in West Lothian and part of Midlothian and which used to find employment for 12,000 men in 1914, reduced to 7,500 (in 1929), and about 4,000 (in 1934), has been passing through one of the recurrent periods of depression and crisis from which it has suffered periodically. In this case a state of general depression is not so directly the cause as developments in other oilfields and lesser normal demands for the production of this industry. The situation has been relieved in twi ways, first by the importation of crude oil for refining, which has, tc some extent, given employment to men thrown out through the closii&quot; of local shale mines, and, secondly, by a very material measure protection for one of the main products. The unemployment position has been materially affected by a method of spreading the work, and the results are fairly satisfactory.This area is in reasonably close proximity to Edinburgh and considerable numbers of workers travel daily to that centre, travelling facilities being abundant and reasonably cheap.It would appear, however, that there are some 700 men in the area who are unlikely to be re-absorbed into this industry and for whom there seems to be comparatively little chance of obtaining other work.(2) North Ayrenire. The problem here is principally coal and in certain parts (e.g., Kilwinning, Coylton, and Galston) the pits have been worked out and closed and the distance to pits still working is such as to make daily travelling difficult even supposing work is available. In some parts there has been an increased demand for women&apos;s labour and this has mitigated the hardship experienced. There would appear to be a permanent surplus of about 4,000 men.(3) Lanarkshire. As would be anticipated the greatest problem is found in parts of Lanarkshire and it is impossible to exclude the city of Glasgow.   While some large villages would appear to be ut&quot;-o hardly hit than others, in no material case is isolation a reason preventing the workers obtaining a share in what work is going.It is impossible to escape the conclusion that Glasgow and West Lanark (with parts of Renfrew and Dumbarton) is an industrial unit rendered so compact by interdependence of the principal industries and-by modern transport facilities that no part can be affected for good or harm without re-action to the whole.95. It is, therefore, as an economic unit that this area has been studied and it is found that without taking into account some 100,000 men presently partly unemployed and who may be regarded as a fluid surplus of labour, there remains a definite surplus of something in the nature of 60,000 men and boys for whom work isofmore :of
unlikely to be available at any time in the industries now operating. This figure has been arrived at after close study of the figures available in the offices of the Ministry of Labour, after thorough investigation into the conditions and prospects of the principal industries, and after extensive consultation with members and officers of Local Authorities, and all who, it was thought, could throw light on the situation.Details will be found in the relative sections in the earlier part of the Report (Part II, Sections 2 and 3).96. In the course of the Inquiry, special attention has been paid to social conditions and social activities (Part II, Section 4). It is satisfactory to learn that the present depression does not seem to have brought physical suffering upon either the unemployed or upon the children. In social activities too warm praise cannot be given to the Scottish Council for Community Service during Unemploy-ment and the Glasgow Council for Community Service in Unemploy-ment for their beneficent work in finding recreational and vocational opportunities to many who otherwise would undoubtedly deteriorate. These bodies co-ordinate the &quot; Club &quot; type of work carried out by many other bodies ; copies of their recent Reports are appended (Appendices V and VI).*A certain measure of Government support is given to these organisations solely and properly to the administration side, the dual work being done, and splendidly done, by enthusiastic and ympathetically minded citizens. I suggest this movement be re-xamined with a view to increasing the financial assistance to the administrative side in order that the scope be considerably enlarged.would specially press this point because there is growing up inlasgow and other Burghs a most objectionable kind of club run y the less desirable type of men and women, and in these centres ambling is probably the least of the evils which prevail. This to ic is a symptom of the desire of the unemployed to gain some ecreational relief from the tedium of their enforced idleness andis very natural desire should so far as possible be met by the pro-ision of centres, which, while relieving the tedium, are also certainly oing something to prevent moral and physical deterioration.97. The Society of Friends and the Scottish National Union of lotment Holders have conferred an immense boon on those un-ployed men for whom they have been able to provide allotments ; (1, finally, one cannot speak too highly of the Training Centres d Re-conditioning Camps of the Ministry of Labour : the former nstructive in every sense, the latter, unfortunately, having usually return the men, splendidly reconditioned, to their former dreary ndition of unemployment.
98. When one comes to concrete recommendations, one realises the impossibility of producing anything in the nature of a 100 per cent, solution.  I think it is fair to say that practically every industry in the area has been tackling its problems with courage, energy and, generally speaking, with efficiency (Part II, Section 2).   Measures for modernisation have been actively undertaken but, as is inevitable the case in the initial stages, have reduced the amount of employment available, though that is not a reason for not proceeding with modernisation ; the alternative being stagnation, dwindling business and ultimately a greater measure of unemployment and distress. Various new industries have been suggested, a few have been started, but it has been found difficult to start industries which are not suited to the peculiar genius of the people.99. A possible remedy in the &quot; Direction of Industry &quot; by the Government has been considered, but discarded as involving too drastic an economic change and involving State responsibility on a large scale (Part III, Section 1). Efforts are continuing to be made by various agencies to attract new industries and it is suggested that this is the principal way in which the end can be achieved ; possibly Local Authorities might do more to co-operate on these lines, one unfortunate instance of failure to do so is referred to elsewhere (The Baird Gas Offer (paragraph 71)).100. It is perhaps a platitude to say that world conditions are chiefly responsible for the position of affairs in Glasgow, and the long-term view is that reduction in tariffs and other hindrances to international trade would go far to remedy matters and possibly that is the only real solution. Pending this it is suggested that having regard to the structure of industry in the West of Scotland resulting in the whole almost invariably gaining or suffering front the condition of the key- industries, it might be considered reasonable to give a certain measure of priority in shipbuilding and possibly other orders to the Clyde area ; any such action it is believed bein;.&apos; likely to provide a greater proportional alleviation of the very serious situation existing than in almost any other district.101. One development which always seems to be on the point of coining to fruition, viz., a low temperature carbonisation method pi dealing with coal would, if it materialised, find a natural home ii Lanarkshire and might result in the opening up of the deeper seam; of coal in the mid-Lanark coalfield which have not yet been touched in fact, not really entirely proved.  Some such new and considerabli outlet for coal would be necessary to justify the expense of sinkin shafts to the required depth, but in the meantime I am of opinin that the field should be explored bv means of borings (paragraph 23-26).
102. It has been indicated earlier (paragraphs 52-53) that a very considerable proportion of those constituting the &quot; hard core &quot; of unemployment are good quality but arc approaching the term of their industrial employment. A promising field for the alleviation of the conditions of these men, especially those living in semi-rural areas, seems to lie in the provision of plots of ground \ to 2 acres in extent, not necessarilyimmediatelyat theirdoors. This scheme may be said quite definitely to have passed the experimental stage, and most of the details as to how it should be fitted in to the provision of Unemployment Benefit have been worked out, and the Department of Agriculture have considerable experience of the creation of such &quot; Holdings &quot; (paragraph S9). I have found almost everywhere a keen desire for some provision of this kind and an anticipation in many cases that it would lead to a reasonable subsistence.I have every confidence in recommending a large development of this provision, first because it immediately relieves the recipient of the tedium of unemployment, and secondly, because it is absolutely the cheapest way on a poundage per man basis to provide access to a reasonable amor;it of land which is still the ambition of many men in Scotland.While there are many men who would straightway make a success of such holdings I can conceive the Ministry of Labour reconditioning centres proving very useful training Schools with very slight changes in their methods, except, of course, that they would have to include older men than is normally the case now. However, I would not suggest the exclusion of the younger men or necessarily the confining of the scheme to Lanarkshire alone. The need exists in West Lothian, North Ayrshire and elsewhere.103. The Ministry of Labour Transference Schemes have been carefully worked out. I think they should be further developed and stimulated, particularly as a contribution towards the solution of the Juvenile problem.As indicated earlier (Part III, Section 2), the two chief difficulties seem to be in the reduction of the family income by the removal of a member whose &quot; Benefit &quot; contribution is a material factor in the household budget and in the sense of isolation and strangeness which afflicts the young transferee in the early stages of his new life. I cannot conceive, however, that there are not very considerable numbers of young men who still have some shreds of the old spirit of adventure and desire to get on who would be available for an extension of this practice.104. It is understood that purely relief works are at present out with the intention of the Government and in tins view I concur generally, but I believe there are districts in Scotland (one or two in Lanarkshire have been carefully surveyed) (paragraph 86) where it might be possible at a reasonable cost per acre to reclaim land and
make it suitable for the smaller type of small holding, possibly also for the 1- to 2-acre plots suggested above. Further, I believe there i-still room for a considerable measure of land drainage work though I am fully aware of the economic difficulties involved (paragraph 87;I would suggest that the Department of Agriculture for Scotland be asked to indicate how far in their view some such schemes mighi provide a measure of alleviation of the problem.105. I was instructed to have regard to the efficiency or otherwise of Local Authorities. It will be recalled that as recently as 1928 tin whole system of Scottish Local Government was re-modelled ; small Parish areas of administration being entirely eliminated as well as other fundamental changes being brought about. Admittedly the new machinery may not yet have developed into full efficiency hoped for, but I can say, without hesitation, that in all the important areas Local Authorities appear to be functioning satisfactorily, and in collaboration with the Government Departments concerned an exercising their powers sympathetically and well.I have therefore no recommendation to make in regard to the creation of some super-body to take over their functions.-106. Finally, in presenting this report, I am fully aware of the inadequacy of my suggestions. I have, however, endeavoured tu present a true and detailed picture of the situation as I found ii. In this I have enjoyed the cordial co-operation of the Division;,1 Controller for Scotland of the Ministry of Labour, Mr. W. S. Dough)-, and his excellent and informed staff. The detail examination of the areas which I could not possibly undertake personally in the short time available has been carried through with celerity and efficient y by Messrs. J. A. Diack, R. Ka.y and J. Johnstone, of the Divisional Office staff, and the results are shown in the voluminous appendio s which I believe to be of considerable value.I have received willing assistance from other Government Departments both in England and Scotland, and from all the Local Authorities concerned, and Mr. A. Arneil of the Department of Health for Scotland placed freely at my disposal his unique knowledge ol social conditions in Lanarkshire.I would like specially to record my very sincere appreciation of my personal colleague, Mr. L. G. Bullock, whose enthusiasm ai d hard work are beyond praise, and of whose contribution to the results of this Inquiry I cannot speak too highly.H. Arthur Rose.17th July, 1934.
APPENDICESVote. Appendices I-III, V and VI have not been printed ; but copies are available at the Ministry of Labour for purposes of reference if desired.)APPENDIX IV SPECIAL REPORT ON THE SCOTTISH FISHING TOWNS1. In considering the question of industrial depression in Scotland the ivailable statistics indicated a serious unemployment problem at the Fishing Towns of Fraserburgh, Peterhead, Buckie, Wick and Stornoway through the contraction of the herring fishing industry.During the course of the Inquiry the interested parties made representations to the Government calling for assistance and the information available for the Inquiry as to the action taken on these representations has been noted solely from Press reports.Special data has been obtained through official and other authoritative sources with the object of ascertaining the employment position and of estimating the extent to which there is a need for remedial measures in order to cope with a permanent surplus or danger of &quot; dereliction.&quot;2. The reduction in the activities of fishing directly affects a large number of &quot; share fishermen &quot; who are not Insured Workers and, therefore, do not appear in official statistics of unemployment. There are, however, numerous ancillary occupations such as Curers, Gutters, Coopers and Labourers who are likely to experience unemployment in proportion to the activities of the fishing Fleets and data relating to these is, therefore, of value as giving some indication of the situation in the Industry.Unemployment3. According to official statistics the state of unemployment in the areas of the respective Local Offices of the Ministry of Labour is as follows : 	Insured		Population		(as at Ju	ly, 1933.)Exchange		Area.

4. Examination of the statistics relating to persistent unemployment among wholly unemployed claimants, however, shows that a very small percentage, usually less than 10 per cent., have been continuously unemployed for a year or more. There is also no evidence of material unemployment among insured persons in other local industry groups and most of the towns are either favoured as seaside resorts or arc adjacent to them. This, no doubt, offers employment for workers in the distributive and building trades, etc.The composition of the respective live registers in April, 1928, and April, 1934, is as follows : 		Live Register April, 1934.				Exchange Area.		Men and		Women and				Young	Boys.	Young	Girls.	Total.		Men.		Women.

Data obtained from local sources generally confirms the serious nature of the reduction in fishing.The following tableJshows the value of the herring catches at the various ports in selected years.Port.	1920.	1924.	192S.	1933.

The general reduction in the number of vessels engaged in the Fishing fleets and the number of persons employed may be noted from the following table: 		1920.		1933.		Port.	Total vessels employed.

The large majority of the above vessels are operated by &quot; sharefishermen6. Local comments on the situation in the Industry attribute the difficulty mainly to the loss of the foreign markets and the lack of demand in the home market. In the latter connection it is urged that some development might lie possible through greater attention to attractive packing and a more definite attempt to popularise herring as a food.A considerable measure of caution is now being observed in fishing and buying owing to the uncertainty of the situation, and recent experiences have so affected the financial stability of the fishing community, that a much reduced number are able to fit out boats for fishing. This fact has tended to freeze up credit facilities by tradesmen and others and a similar position is said -to exist on the curing side.7. Some of the ports are developing white or Seine net fishing, but this does not offer the same shore employment as herring and is not regarded as a material contribution to improve the local situation. The following further details have been furnished regarding points of particular interest in the respective ports: FraserburghIt is generally felt that apart from the recent opening in Russia there is a grave danger of many of the &quot; share &quot; fishermen having to apply for poor relief and of serious unemployment among shore workers. It is considered that any extension of fishing made possible by Government help may lead to the landing of larger quantities of fish than it is possible to find a market for. Boatbuilders are now building smaller craft with crude oil engines, which are more economical to run than steam drifters. The boats can be used for summer herring and white fishing during the winter months. This may, however, create a larger &quot; glut &quot; of supplies in the absence of new markets.PeterheadDuring the last three winters it is stated that hundreds of persons con-nccted with the fishing industry have claimed public assistance which was not required in previous years. There has been a serious fall in the numbers employed here and a large number of fishermen are experiencing financial
difficulties. It is not anticipated that the cured herrings for the British market (700,000 barrels) can nearly compensate for the loss of foreign trade and that the Industry cannot compete with the growing number of subsidised foreign fleets. Many curers have lost money and have not now the necessary capital to continue in business.WickThere has been a notable increase in the amount of white fish landed durine the past two years owing to the development of the Seine Net Fishing from 4,714 cwts. (in 1931) to 11,218 cwts. (in 1933) with an increase in value from  3,029 to  19,530. The fish is, however, iced and forwarded direct to South markets and little shore employment is created.A Committee has been appointed by the Town Council to consider the provision of the smaller boats used in this class of fishing, no doubt in an endeavour to provide an alternative in the hopeless outlook facing herrim fishing.In respect of herring fishing the experiences here are similar to those reported elsewhere.BuckieThere is general uncertainty among both fishermen and curers and very little preparation is being made for the present season. This is partly attributed to financial stringency. It is considered that less than one-half of the herring fleet is now in a sea-worthy condition and the owners of the remainder are unable to bear the cost of re-conditioning.General conclusion. There can be little doubt that the situation cannot be materially improved until there is a considerably larger market for the herrings. Indeed, it h pointed out that already many of the catches are being dumped overboard in the absence of buyers. Thus any encouragement given to greater number: of boats to go fishing can only lead to more serious competition and wasteThe most natural solution to the problem is, therefore, an extension c: markets by every possible means. In the absence of such a developmea there can be no alternative to more serious employment both among tt insured shore workers and the uninsured &quot; share &quot; fishermen. This wouU at once raise the extremely difficult problem of providing some form oi alternative occupation in a case where, by nature, the persons concerned an clannish and are, therefore, unlikely to take kindly to a development whid must differ materially from the trade which they have virtually inherited This characteristic has jundoubtedly contributed in some measure to tk difficulties encountered in attempts to rationalise and restrict the fleets t conformity with the falling market.It will probably be of little practical value, having regard to the series difficulties involved, to consider indirect methods of alleviating or solvir.: the local problem of unemployment until every possible avenue has bee: tried for increasing the home and foreign herring markets. The crisis is;: comparatively recent date and attention is being given to it by the Governme:: and other Authorities.(14591 C)   150   7/34
