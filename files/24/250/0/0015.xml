Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1934.SECRET............ Copy No.CP. 190 (34).CABINET.COMMITTEE ON COMMERCIAL AIR TRANSPORT.REPORT.AT their Meeting on the 6th December, 1933 (Cabinet 68 (33), Conclusion 6), the Cabinet had before them two Memoranda (Paper No. CP. 249. (33) and Paper No. CP. 286 (33)) on the Position of British Commercial Air Transport, and agreed &quot; (a) That a Cabinet Committee as follows : The President of the Board of Trade (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for India,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State for Air,The Postmaster-General,The Financial Secretary to the Treasury,should consider the following terms of reference : &quot; To review the present position of British commercial air transport, with special reference to the further development of Imperial air routes; and to make recommendations as to future policy, and, in particular, as to the relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Imperial Airways &quot;;and report to the Cabinet.(b) That the terms of reference quoted above should be interpreted to enable cognate questions, including shipping services, for example, to be considered.&quot;2. In asking for the appointment of a Cabinet Committee to assist and advise on certain major issues of policy with which he found himself confronted, the Secretary of State for Air indicated the following four main questions as requiring decision : (i) When the existing agreements with Imperial Airways run out in 1937 to 1939, are we prepared to continue to subsidise the development of commercial air transport?(ii) If so, what are to be the future relations between the Government and imperial Airways, i.e., do we intend to continue to use the Company as our chosen instrument for the development of Imperial trunk air routes ?(iii) If the answers to (i) and (ii) are in the affirmative, is there to be anyattempt to establish the Company on a broader Imperial basis by endeavouring to evolve a scheme of closer co-operation and mutual partnership between the United Kingdom and the Dominions and Colonies ?
(iv) Is it possible by a greatly extended use of aircraft for the carriage of mails to accelerate the development of a system of civil air communi-cations and advance the date by when air transport will become commercially self-supporting 13. Of these we found at an early stage that the fourth and last was by far the most important, and it is to its examination that we have chiefly devoted our deliberations. Accordingly, we proceed to deal first with this question; our recommendations in regard to questions (i), (ii) and (iii) will be found in paragraphs 9 to 11 below.4. After protracted inter-departmental discussions and negotiations with Imperial Airways, the Secretary of the Air Ministry and the Director-General of the Post Office have submitted in collaboration a scheme which we have no hesitation in recommending to the Cabinet for acceptance. Particulars of this scheme will be found in Appendix I. It will be seen that it envisages the carriage by air of all first-class mail of Empire origin and destination (except in the case of Canada and certain Colonies which cannot at present be connected with the United Kingdom by air services), and also foreign air mails as agreed as from a date to be fixed later, but in no case earlier than 1937, since special aircraft will have to be developed for its operation. The service will cater for passengers as well as mails. In the abstract there is much to be said for a divorce of passenger from mail traffic, but we are satisfied that such a divorce would be wholly uneconomic at the present stage of development, and could not indeed be brought within the limits of practicable finance.We consider the scheme will represent an epoch-making advance in our system of Imperial communications and feel that, if properly presented to them, it should make a strong imaginative appeal to the Dominions, India and the Colonies, whose whole-hearted co-operation will, of course, be essential for its successful inauguration.5. The time and frequency schedules tentatively envisaged are set out in detail in Appendix II. It will be observed from the table there printed that there will be at least *7 services weekly to Egypt, *4 services weekly to India, 3 services weekly to East Africa and the Straits Settlements, and 2 services weekly to South Africa and Australia. Coupled with this remarkable multiplication of existing services, their speed of operation is to be greatly accelerated, and it is hoped to work by degrees to a time schedule which will, when night flying is fully developed, bring Karachi within 2 , Cape Town within 4 , and Sydney within 7  days of London.These schedules are based on the use of aircraft with a cruising speed of 130 m.p.h. Materially higher speeds are feasible technically, but here, as in all other forms of transport, can only be purchased at a cost which we feel would be excessive. In all the circumstances a speed of 130 m.p.h. seems to us a reasonable compromise between technical and economic considerations.Indeed, the combined improvement in speed and frequency, indicated in Appendix II, taken in conjunction with the bold innovation of the carriage of all first-class mail by air, should in our judgment put this country in the forefront of long-distance air and postal development. It will, moreover, we consider, be of the utmost value to the Empire as a whole, alike from the political, the commercial and the strategic points of view. Its achievement would, in our opinion, be worth a very substantial additional expenditure, but in fact the extra cost involved will be comparatively small in relation to the outstanding advantages offered.In this connection we are informed that, if the scheme is approved, Imperial Airways will, within the next three years, be placing orders for aircraft and engines to a total value of some  1,500,000 with the aircraft manufacturing industry in this country, which will afford a very substantial measure of employment.6. The original proposals put before us by the Air Ministry envisaged a postal rate of 2\d. per half-ounce, supplemented by a letter-card at l^d., on which basis a joint report placed before us by the Secretary of the Air Ministry and the* It is possible that there will ultimately be 8 services to Eg-ypt and 5 to India.
late Secretary to the Post Office indicated that the scheme could be brought into being virtually without extra cost.The Postmaster-General, however, whilst prepared to recommend a reduction in the unit of weight, is opposed to any increase in the initial postal rate and has advised us that the political and general attractiveness of the scheme will be greatly enhanced by retention of the \\d. rate. His proposal is that this rate shall in future be chargeable per half-ounce, instead of per ounce as to-day. This will naturally increase the cost of the scheme, but we accept and endorse his view.It has been necessary to introduce certain other modifications into the scheme in the course of its further elaboration and,, as a result, it is estimated that the extra annual cost to the United Kingdom Exchequer will initially be about  170,000. This represents the additional charge on Air Votes, assuming the Dominions, India and the Colonies contribute on the scale indicated in para-graph 6 (&amp;) of Appendix I. The payments from Air Votes will, however, be on a diminishing scale and should ultimately fall well below the present annual provision for commercial air transport subsidies, viz.,  430,000.Should the Dominions, India and the Colonies not be prepared to contribute on this scale and we anticipate that India in particular may be a source of difficulty we think the advantages of the scheme are so outstanding that the United Kingdom Exchequer should be prepared to make good any deficiency, which should not, we hope, entail an additional outlay in excess of  100,000 per annum.In addition, as explained in paragraph 6 (a) of Appendix I, retention of the \\d. instead of the 2\d. rate will involve the Post Office in an initial loss of approximately  200,000 per annum, which should, however, be reduced in subsequent years as a result of the growth of the mail. This  200,000, however, being borne by the Post Office, will not constitute a direct charge on the Exchequer.We recommend -that early negotiations should be opened with the Dominions, India and the Colonies concerned with a view to securing their agreement to the scheme in principle.7. There are at present no air mail services to Hong Kong or West Africa. We are informed that connecting services to both could be provided for au additional cost of  75,000 per annum. If the Colonies concerned are willing to find a reasonable proportion of that sum, we recommend that consideration should be given to linking them up by air with the Mother Country at an early date and in advance of the main scheme.The West African service may involve some difficulty, since the route via the Sudan is materially longer (and proportionately more costly to operate) than the route via Spain and the Sahara, which is available to the French. Nevertheless, if a British service is not provided at an early date there will here, as also in the case of Hong Kong, be a danger of the organisation of French or other foreign air services to serve these Colonies. We think it in principle undesirable that British possessions should be dependent on a system of air communications under foreign control, where this can be avoided.8. At an early stage of our discussions there emerged a factor to which we attach great weight, viz., the reactions of this scheme upon shipping. This factor also introduces some important financial considerations.The development of any new form of transport almost inevitably entails adverse reactions on its older competitors. Fortunately there is here no question of the complete supersession of one system by another as the railway superseded the stage coach in the nineteenth century. All second-class mail and the great bulk of passenger traffic will continue to go by sea under the new scheme. The reactions on the shipping companies will, nevertheless, be substantial. Were the shipping industry enjoying prosperous, or even normal, conditions, we do not think any special measures would be necessary; tramp shipping is, of course, entirely unaffected, and, as the scheme does not at this stage embrace a trans-Atlantic air service owing to technical difficulties, only three shipping companies are appreciably affected by the main scheme, viz., the P. and O., the Orient, and the Union Castle.Their total loss of revenue, if a proportionate deduction were to be made from the payments they at present receive, would, we estimate, be of the order of  250,000 per annum.   We consider that, having regard to the serious fall
which has taken place in the revenue of these companies in recent years and the fierce competition to which they are at present subjected by subsidised foreign companies, if there has been no change in these respects by 1937, when the air scheme is due to commence, the present scale of payments should be maintained, despite the fact that they will no longer be carrying first-class mail. We do not, however, regard the cost of this measure of relief to the shipping industry as a fair charge against the air scheme. Nevertheless, if it be thought desirable, when the time comes, to avoid any overt subsidy to shipping, continuance of the present payments to the companies concerned could doubtless be arranged as part of this scheme. For example, whilst the United Kingdom Post Office finance the P. and O. service, receiving contributions therefor from the Indian, Australian and other Governments, South Africa finances the Union Castle contract and Australia that with the Orient Line, the two Dominion Governments concerned each in their turn receiving payments from the United Kingdom Post Office. It might be possible to abate the air subsidies payable by South Africa and Australia to Air Votes by the amount of the present payments from the United Kingdom Post Office towards the cost of the shipping services financed by them, on the understanding that the present payments to the Union Castle and Orient Lines will not be reduced.Again, in the case of the P. and O, consideration might be given to maintaining the present annual payment by the Post Office unchanged.We would in this connection again emphasise that the air scheme is not to be introduced until 1937 at earliest, and it is impossible three years in advance of this date to say what measure of financial assistance to the shipping companies affected will in fact be found necessary when the time comes.9. Turning now to questions (i) to (iii) of paragraph 2 above, we have reached the conclusion that (i) can only be answered in the affirmative, i.e., we must continue to subsidise air transport. As pointed out by the Secretary of State for Air in CP. 249 (33), other nations are pursuing a policy of active commercial air development, and their expenditure on subsidies is on a far larger scale than our own. In the U.S.A., for example, the concealed subsidy in the form of postal contracts on which the American Post Office incurs a heavy loss was last year approximately  4f million per annum, or more than ten times our own expenditure; whilst the French- Government have contracted to pay Air France (the consolidated undertaking into which the previously existing French air transport companies were amalgamated last year) an annual subsidy in excess of  1,000,000 for a fifteen-year period, which does not terminate until the end of 1947.10. We also give an affirmative answer to question (ii), i.e., we consider that we should continue to develop British commercial air transport through the medium of Imperial Airways. The Secretary of State for Air has given figures illustrative of the remarkable success attained by Imperial Airways in paragraph 4 of CP. 249 (33). We have no doubt that our policy of concentrating the development of British commercial air transport in the hands of a single strong undertaking (which was only adopted after exhaustive investigations and after a system of competing companies had resulted in complete failure) has been fully justified by the experience of the past ten years and should be continued. Germany followed our example in this regard some years ago; France did so last year, and Italy is reported to be contemplating similar action at an early date. We have received representations from the Society of British Aircraft Constructors urging return to a system of competing companies, but we are satisfied that such a system would be uneconomic and contrary to the best interests of the development of British commercial air transport on a strong and durable basis. A reversion to competition would, indeed, be to ignore alike the lessons of our own past experience in various spheres of transport and communications beside the air, as well as the trend of air transport development in those countries which are our principal competitors.We have, therefore, reached the conclusion that Imperial Airways should be informed that, so long as His Majesty&apos;s Government remain satisfied that their operations are being both economically and efficiently conducted, they will continue to be employed as our chosen instrument for the development of Imperial
SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.12.   Our recommendations may accordingly be summarised as under: (a) That the necessity for continuing to subsidise British commercial air transport after the current agreements with Imperial Airways expire should be accepted.(b) That Imperial Airways should continue to be regarded as our choseninstrument for the development of British commercial air transport overseas.(c) That  Imperial  Airways   should   continue,   as  at  present,  to   be accorded the maximum of commercial freedom, and that, in consequence, no attempt should be made to evolve a scheme which would give the Dominions and Colonies any direct executive control in its management. Consideration should, however, be given to the institution of a non-executive Advisory Board in London on which the Dominions, India and Colonies would be represented.(d) That the scheme outlined in Appendix I should be approved inprinciple, including the following concrete proposals: (i) The organisation by 1937 of passenger and mail services in accordance with the schedule in Appendix II. This will provide, in addition to the immense acceleration, of which examples are cited in paragraph 5 above, seven services a week to Egypt, four services a week to India, three services a week to East Africa and the Straits Settlements and two services a week to South Africa and Australia.(ii) The carriage by these services of all first-class Empire mailby air at a fiat rate (in so far as concerns the United Kingdom) of If d. per half-ounce except in the case of Canada and i certain Colonies which cannot at present be connected with the United Kingdom by air services.(iii) The conclusion of a contract with  Imperial Airways inrespect of (i) and (ii) for a period of fifteen years on the financial basis outlined in Appendix I.trunk air routes for a period Of 15 years from 1937. They will thus be given a similar security of tenure to that for which the French Government have contracted with Air France (see preceding paragraph).. 11. As regards question (iii), viz., whether any attempt should.be made to establish the Company on a broader Imperial basis, we have reached the conclusion that the ends of efficiency and economy will be best subserved if Imperial Airways is given (as is the present policy of the Air Ministry) the maximum of commercial freedom. We think any attempt to give the Dominions and Colonies a direct share in the control of the Company must militate against such commercial freedom, and we do not therefore recommend any special measures designed to this end. Imperial Airways is already working through an Indian subsidiary company in India and between India and Singapore, and the forthcoming service between Australia and Singapore is to be operated through the medium of a subsidiary jointly owned by Imperial Airways and a leading Australian air transport company. These are, in practice, commercial rather than political arrangements, though they originated from political causes, and it is through the medium of similar arrangements that we consider that closer co-operation with Dominion and Colonial interests should primarily be sought, rather than by any more elaborate measures in the Governmental sphere.The utmost we should recommend is the institution of an Advisory Board in London on which the Dominions and Colonies might be represented. This Board should be strictly non-executive and might meet, for example, at quarterly intervals.
(iv) The maintenance of the present level of shipping payments to the steamship lines concerned irrespective of the fact that they will no longer be carrying first-class mail-this recommendation to be contingent on a review of the position of the shipping industry at a suitable period before the air scheme is due to commence.(e) That negotiations should be opened forthwith with the Dominions,India and the Colonies concerned in order to give effect to the scheme.(f) That consideration should be given to the provision at an early dateof air services to Hong Kong and West Africa.Signed&apos; on behalf of the Committee:WALTER.

APPENDIX I.Committee on Commercial Air Transport.Report by the Secretary of the Air Ministry and the Director-General of theGeneral Post Of/ice.1. At the last meeting of the Committee in May we were directed to prepare a report embodying a concrete scheme for the development of Imperial air transport and the carriage of all first-class mail matter by air for submission to the Cabinet.We regret the delay which has arisen in presenting this report. This has been due to the necessity for complex and protracted negotiations with Imperial Airways, which the Air Ministry had hitherto no reason to anticipate.2. The Board of Imperial Airways have, unfortunately, found themselves under the necessity of materially revising and increasing the provisional estimates of cost which were originally furnished for the Committee&apos;s information. We do not think, however, that the Company can fairly be criticised on this account, since their original figures were furnished at short notice and their entirely pro-visional character was emphasised. Moreover, the finance of the scheme, owing to its novelty and magnitude, involves assessments of cost and revenue which must necessarily be to a large extent problematical. It is, in fact, inevitably dependent on a number of unknown quantities.3. Nevertheless, we did not feel able to accept the revised quotation submitted by the Company, and in consequence it became necessary for the Air Ministry to subject their estimates to detailed examination and criticism, as a result of which a material reduction has been effected.4. The main features of the resultant scheme and the proposed basis of agreement with the Company may be outlined as follows : (i) As from 1937 all first-class mail matter of Empire origin and destina-tions (except in the case of Canada and certain Colonies which cannot at present be connected with the United Kingdom by air services) will be carried by air. In the case of the United Kingdom, the postal charge will be a flat rate of l\d. per half-ounce in lieu of l\d. per ounce, and Id. per subsequent ounce as at present. The Dominions and Colonies will be free to fix their own postal rates at their discretion, as they do to-day.(ii) Imperial Airways will operate air services of the approximate frequency indicated in the table annexed to this report, which also contains a provisional time schedule.(iii) These services will cater for passengers as well as mail.(iv) The Company will carry all external first-class mail of Empire originand destination without limit, and foreign air mails as agreed.(v) The agreement with Imperial Airways will cover a fifteen-year period.(vi) The agreement will provide for an annual average payment over this period of  1,500,000. If it should not prove practicable to induce all the Colonies and Dominions covered by the services to remit taxation on petrol and oil and landing and housing fees in the Company&apos;s favour (which would, of course, merely entail a sacrifice on their part of potential, not current, revenue), this figure will be increased by the amount of such taxation and fees, which, on a basis of current practice, is estimated at a maximum of  100,000, making a total possible annual liability of  1,600,000.Various Dominions and Colonies already accord remission of such taxation and fees to-day, and the Air Ministry see no reason therefore to contemplate that this full liability will in fact be incurred.
(vii) In recognition of the many doubtful elements in estimates alike of revenue and costs, and the difficulties with which the Company is bound to be confronted in the early years of a scheme of - this magnitude, the fifteen years covered by the agreement will be divided into five three-year periods, and the total payments to the Company will be on a descending scale, commencing at  1,650,000 for the first period and declining by triennial reductions of  75.000 to  1,350,000 for the final period.&quot;(viii) Having regard to the fact that petrol and oil constitute some 60 per cent, of prime costs, and are peculiarly liable to fluctuations of price due to extraneous causes, there will be provision for an annual review of these items and adjustments of the payments to the Company upwards or downwards in accordance with any material variation in the price level.(ix) Further, in order to ensure that the State shall derive benefit from any fall in costs which may be brought about by future technical progress, there will be a review of prime costs and obsolescence at the end of each three-year period. One-half of any savings which may result from this review will accrue to the Government (to be shared equally between the Air Ministry and the Post Office) in the form of a further reduction in the annual payments to the Company over and above those provided for in the agreed schedule, and one-half will be retained by the Company.(x) In view, however, of the many uncertain factors involved, it will beopen to the Company at the end of any three-year period to ask for a detailed examination of its books. If this examination shows that, through causes beyond the Company&apos;s control, estimates of revenue or cost have not fulfilled anticipations, and therefore that the scheduled reduction in payments for the ensuing three-year period is not justified, the whole or part of such reduction will be remitted until warranted by the facts.(xi) Finally, the Government will retain a deferred shareholding in theCompany as at present, which will entitle the Exchequer to half any profits earned in excess of 10 per cent.5. We feel that the above scheme is fair to both parties. The Company will be debarred from making excessive profits, and will, moreover, have a strong incentive to take advantage of every new technical development which holds out promise of reducing costs. At the same time the Government will derive direct benefit from any such reduction in costs. The Company will, however, have reasonable protection if, as they contend, we have cut their estimates of cost too low and/or assessed potential revenue too high. The Air Ministry are of the opinion that the progressive reduction in aircraft operating costs which has followed on technical advances in recent years is likely to continue, and that the declining schedule of payments is fully justified. But we must concede that this is a matter of opinion and that the basic figures of the scheme are to a large extent speculative. The technique of aircraft manufacture and operation is still fluid, and it is not possible as yet to make firm estimates such as are possible in the case of the older forms of transport by steamship, rail and road.6. It remains for us to make recommendations in regard to the provision of funds to enable the overall payments indicated in paragraph 4 (vii) above to be made to the Company. In making these recommendations the Post Office wish to record that, while agreeing, so far as they are able, that the overall amounts appear reasonable, the responsibility for determining these sums is a matter for the Air Ministry. For their part, however, the Post Office are prepared to justify the payments indicated below for postal services.Our proposals are therefore divided as follows :  (a) The Post Office will find a flat figure of  900,000 per annum throughout, of which  525,000 is attributable to British outward mails,  30,000 to Air Mails of foreign origin and  345,000 should be recovered on a  proportionate   basis  from  the  postal  administrations  of  the
Dominions, India and the Colonies concerned, which will be a matter for early negotiation with them.In accepting this liability the British Post Office will be contri-buting the difference between the cost of air transport and the revenue available at \\d. per \ oz. This is estimated to represent an initial deficiency of approximately  200,000 in the first year, but this deficiency should be reduced in subsequent years by the growth of the mail. This figure ( 200,000) may be increased to the extent (if any) to which the contributions expected from the Dominions and Colonial post offices fall short of the sum of  345,000.It thus appears that the Post Office might be faced with an initial loss of the order of as much as  300,000, but it is expected that the net growth in the Post Office revenue between now and 1937 will cover a loss of this magnitude and that the maintenance of the Exchequer contribution at its present level will not therefore be endangered. Any such loss will, however, be a factor to be taken into consideration in settling future Exchequer contributions.(b) The balance of  750,000 progressively declining to  450,000 after the twelfth year of the scheme will be borne on Air Votes by way of direct subsidy. These are, however, gross figures, and until negotiations have been completed with the Dominions, India and the Colonies as to the amount of their contributions, we cannot accurately estimate the net charge which will be imposed on Air Votes. The Air Ministry consider that it would be reasonable to ask for contributions totalling  200,000 from the Dominions, India and the Colonies, in addition to remission of taxation of petrol and oil and landing and housing fees, in which event the net cost of the scheme to Air Votes would be  550,000 falling to  250,000, as compared with a current provision for subsidies to commercial air transport of  430,000. As, however, certain subsidies in respect of European and other services are payable to Imperial Airways under existing agreements until 1939, the figure of  550,000 would in the financial years 1937 and 1938 be increased to approximately  600,000 or  170,000 in excess of the current provision. Ultimately, however, as above stated, this figure would fall to  250,000 or  180,000 less than the current provision.In the event of the Dominions, India or the Colonies not being prepared to remit taxation on petrol and oil and landing and housing fees (see paragraph 4 (vi) above), it will be for Air Votes and not for the Post Office to find whatever additional sum may be necessary on this account.We would emphasise the necessarily tentative character at this stage of the estimates under head (b); it may be that the Dominions, India and the Colonies also will prefer a diminishing scale of payments to a flat rate, without change in the total amounts payable by them over the fifteen-year period as a whole. In this event the net charge on Air Votes would require adjustment accordingly. We trust, however, that the above broad approximations will suffice to enable the Cabinet to take a decision on the scheme, which we strongly recommend for acceptance.(Signed) C. LL.
