(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).COPY No,11SECRET.CP.  224(34) .CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation by the Government of India, dated 16th October, 1934.Circulated for the information of the cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India dated 15th October 1934, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.There has been a considerable increase in political activity with the near approach of the general election.    Nominations have been filed, and polling takes place about the middle of November.    The political situation, especially in regard to Congress, is still confused.    It is impossible, therefore, to make any forecast of results, but some points which may affect the results may be indicated.Congress still enjoys the advantage of being the best organised political party, though their position is considerably weakened by internal disputes between the various groups.      The controversy between orthodox Congress supporters and Nationalists shows   no signs of   abating, and recent visits paid by the Nationalist leader Malaviya to Punjab and Bihar have not eased the position in these provinces.    In Bihar, it is reported that the only effect of his recent tour has been apparently to create confusion in the minds of Congress supporters, while in Punjab Congress is said to have a very uphill fight to face and there have been acrimonious disputes over the selection of candidates for the general constituencies.In the United Provinces the Socialist group, as a result no doubt of the influence of Jawahar Lai Nehru, have captured a majority of the seats on the Provincial Congress Committee.  In the district of Benares the Socialists have obtained complete control of the local Committee, supporters of Mr.Gandhi and the Council Entry policy being very few in number.    In Bombay the Socialists have achieved less success in the Congress election, but they form a vocal ana active minority which, if aided by those who hold Communist views, may
prove troublesome to the more orthodox Congress group. In this Presidency the Democratic Swaraj Party which was formed last year in Mahratta country, has declared its independence of all Congress Parties, but its policy is not markedly different from that of Congress and its futo.ro is uncertain.   &quot;Other Provinces report numerous local disputes over the selection of candidates, but it would be rash to assume that these disputes will not be settled before the actual elections take place.Congress candidates may also be somewhat handicapped in their election campaign by having to attend the Bombay Congress which takes place about a fortnight before the date of the poll, bat a carefully staged demonstration on the eve of, and on the day of, the poll may lessen the handicap.    In the United Provinces they are also said to be handicapped by lack of funds.It is important to correct the impression, if it exists, that the    election   is a struggle between Government and Congress.      Government and its officers are of course precluded from taking any active part or exerting any influence in the election and comparatively few of those who support Government in its policy of reform have the means or the organisation to enable them to stand for election. Madras is the only Province in which there is a political party in opposition to Congress, and leaders of the Justice Party have been conducting an
energetic election campaign.    An interesting speech was recently delivered by the Honourable Raja Bobbili,    a Minister, in which he explained that the policy of his party was to stand by the White Paper as modified by the memorandum of the British India delegates.He, however, defended   the provision of safeguards to satisfy the various minorities and their interests as it was but natural, when the real political power was being transferred into the hands of Indians, that they should be apprehensive of their future position in the body politic. He ridiculed the Congress proposals for a constituent Assembly and the rejection of the communal award which was made by His Majesty1s Government as a result of their own inability to solve the problem.    Other leaders of this party, including the President of the Legislative Assembly, whose seat is being contested, have made similar attacks on Congress.  It is significant also that in the municipal elections which have also been fought on party lines Congress have not done particularly well.In the North West Frontier Province,which for the first time enjoys the right to elect its own representative^, there is an interesting contest between the deputy leader of the Red Shirts, Dr.Kh.aa. Sahib, who has recently been released from detention, and the loyalist Khan who stands for the White Paper, the communal award, and an increase in provincial subvention.
In the other Provinces attempts to form parties in opposition to Congress have not met with any marked success. Pew people in the Provinces are deeply interested in the Assembly elections and few independent candidates of pea.tion or influence    are prepared to come forward and incur the expenditure involved in a contested election so as to secure a seat: which would not improve their personal position to the sane extent as a seat on the Provincial Council.      In the event of three cornered contests in general constituencies, independent candidates nay profit by disputes of their rivals, though there is always the risk of their rivals settling their disputes at the last moment.The position of Congress has not been made easier by a statement issued by Mr.Gandhi in the middle of September in which he confirmed the rumour that he was contemplating severing all physical connections with Congress, lie, however, left a loophole, for he stated that, after consideration of all pros and cons, he had postponed his final step till after the Congress Session in October.His reasons for this step were that he felt that a very large body of the Congress intelligentsia were tired of his methods, views and programme. He had differences regarding the socialistic programme and also regarding the policy to be adopted in regard to the Indian States. He also referred to the growing corruption in Congress ranks and to the fact that Congress, instead of being the most democratic institution in the country, had degenerated into an organisation dominated by a single personality. As a cure, apparently, for those defects apart from his own retirement, he advocated hand-spinning as the Congress franchise,  while he also recommended a somewhat unintelligible verbal change in the Congress constitution by changing the words
&quot;legitimate and peaceful means&quot; to &quot;truthful and non-violent means&quot;.His statement has been vigorously criticised in the Nationalist Press, especially his reiteration of his old and unpopular fad of hand-spinning. What course he will ultimately take, both at the Congress Session and afterwards, is extremely uncertain, but possibly he may adopt a middle course and, while withdrawing from the active deliberations of the executive bodies, continue to be a member of Congress and from an outside position to influence their policy.
