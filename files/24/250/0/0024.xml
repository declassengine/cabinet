Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1934.SECRET. Copy No,CP. 199 (34).CABINET.THE ECONOMIC SITUATION AND INTER-IMPERIAL RELATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN a recent memorandum (P.M.S. (33) 12) circulated to the Produce Markets Supply Committee, I called attention to some of the considerations arising, in relating to the Dominions, in connection with the meat situation, and I urged in particular that we ought to have in our minds a much clearer idea than we have at present as to the extent to which we propose to develop the various branches of agriculture in this country.2. The discussions with the Dominion High Commissioners which have since taken place have confirmed me in this view; and, indeed, I feel that a review of the whole position on a still wider basis would be very desirable.3. As I see it, we are faced with the need for reconciling and adjusting to the best of our ability a whole series of interests, of which the most important are : (a) the needs of our agricultural interests at home,(&amp;) the needs of the exporting industries of the United Kingdom,(c) the maintenance and development of our shipping, and(d) our position as a creditor country in relation to countries such as theDominions and the Argentine which can only pay the interest on their debts, and repay the capital of those debts, by the export of goods, and mainly by the export of primary products.4. It is perhaps hardly necessary for me to elaborate the possibilities of conflict between certain of these interests. We are facing them every day in relation to our short-term policy, e.g., in relation to meat. Apart from this, my colleagues will have in mind the fact that the whole basis of the Ottawa Agree-ment, and several of the agreements with foreign countries, will come up for review within the next year or two.5. In addition we have to remember that the United Kingdom is still, in fact, if no longer in legal form, the centre and mainstay of the British Common-wealth.Taking the long view, surely we stand to gain by retaining the confidence and goodwill of the rest of the Empire, and particularly the Dominions, in relation to our economic policy, even at the expense of some immediate sacrifice of commercial advantage.6. I realise to the full the difficulties of the situation, and it is clear that we cannot evolve, at a moment &apos;s notice, a policy of what may perhaps be called &apos;&apos; reconciliation of opposites.&quot;7. I believe, however, that it would be well for us to survey the ground as a whole in much the same manner as the Ministerial Disarmament Committee has acted in relation to naval, military and air requirements.8. I suggest that, as a first step, representatives of the various Departments concerned should be instructed to make a preliminary survey during the recess of the various aspects of the problem.(Initialled)   J. H. T.Dominions Office, July 20, 1934.[10339]
