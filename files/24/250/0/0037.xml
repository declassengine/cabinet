Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 212 (34).CABINET.THE FOREIGN TRADE OF THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IT is unnecessary for me to give here any elaborate account of the export trade of the Colonial Empire. Broadly speaking, that trade is confined to a few important and a much larger number of minor products falling in the class of food-stuffs and raw materials. Of some important products the Colonial Empire produces larger quantities than the United Kingdom and the rest of the Empire can consume.2. For some time past I have been watching with growing concern the increasing obstacles which are being put in the way of Colonial exports to foreign countries.3. The position is all the more serious because some of the commodities principally affected are those of which Empire production exceeds Empire demand. A mere policy of Imperial Preference is not sufficient to help the Colonial producer of such goods; unless the foreign markets can be kept open, his production, and with it his purchasing power, must necessarily be contracted.4. It is true that in the case of three important commodities, rubber, tea and tin, international agreements for the regulation of supply have secured the position of the Colonial producer to some extent. Provided that the world consumption of these commodities is maintained, he is sure of his present share of the market and it matters very little to him whether a particular foreign country imports the British or the foreign article.5. The other commodities, however, of which Empire production is in excess of Empire consumption are not subject to any regulation scheme, and in these articles there is unrestricted competition between British and foreign products; any trade advantages obtained by our foreign competitors automatically restrict pro tanto the field of the Colonial producer. The two most important commodities in this class are the large group of oil-seeds and nuts and vegetable oils and cocoa, but there are a number of other articles of less importance.6. There is a wide difference between the circumstances of these various commodities, but broadly speaking there are two distinct problems: (a) in the case of those commodities which are essential to foreign countries, but of which potential or actual production is in excess of demand, such as, for instance, the oils and fats, to secure an adequate share of the world market for the Colonial producer, and (&amp;) in the case of those commodities which are useful or desirable but not of prime necessity, such as tea, cocoa and fruit, not only to secure an adequate share of the world market for the Colonial producer but also to ensure that foreign countries do not diminish their consumption of such articles.7. For some time past it has been becoming increasingly difficult for the Colonial producer to sell his goods in certain foreign countries.8. These difficulties have been cumulative. In the early stages of the world economic crisis, they arose principally from increases in the duties on articles not of prime necessity, and, a little later, from quantitative restrictions on the importation of such goods. In this stage Colonial producers found their markets contracting, but at any rate fared no worse than their foreign competitors.[10564]
9. In the next stage, however, when certain foreign countries made the importation of certain articles subject to &quot;barter&quot; arrangements, the Colonial producer found himself at a decided disadvantage, since, for various reasons, and in particular the policy of Imperial Preference, he was seldom or never in a position to take advantage of such arrangements.10. The third and last stage, which now appears to be developing, is even more unsatisfactory. Certain foreign countries are deliberately concluding agreements on a preferential basis which have the effect of giving foreign producers of Colonial products preferential treatment over producers in the Colonial Empire.11. The most striking example of an agreement of this kind is that by which Germany has undertaken to give preferential treatment to oilseeds and nuts from the Netherlands East Indies.12. Concurrently with these special and novel forms of restraint on British Colonial trade there has been in countries with Colonial possessions a vigorous development of the quite legitimate policy of Colonial preference, and in many countries a development of the system of protection of the home producer, which is legitimate in itself, but has been carried in some cases to quite unreasonable lengths. Both of these policies have had a detrimental effect on Colonial trade.13. The difficulties which thus confront the Colonial Empire cannot be a matter of indifference to the United Kingdom. Her interest in the matter is threefold.14. In the first place, the Colonial Empire is a customer of growing importance. Reduced exports therefrom, and the consequential diminution of purchasing power therein, have the direct consequence of reducing exports from the United Kingdom thereto and diminishing the number of British cargoes.15. In the second place, the United Kingdom has been, and is still, pressing the Colonial Empire to impose quotas and to increase preferences for the benefit of United Kingdom goods. This is being accepted with goodwill; but the lower the cash receipts of the Colonial Empire, the harder the higher price of United Kingdom goods bears on the native inhabitants. They will certainly, and quite reasonably, ask the United Kingdom in return to make use of the bargaining power derived from her unfavourable trade balance with a number of foreign countries to secure increased markets for their products.16. In the third place, it is only by the utilisation of Reserves accumulated in more prosperous times, and by drastic economies carried to extreme limits, that a number of Dependencies have been kept from coming to the British Exchequer for Grants in aid. The last thing which anyone could desire is the continuance of a situation which, in the end, would inevitably lead to the necessity for larger grants in. aid.17. The position is one which, in my view, calls for early and careful consideration. Time is running against us in every way. There is no sign of any diminution in the harmful activities of foreign countries. There is still &amp; tendency to impose new restrictions on importation, and there is the ever-present possibility of foreign countries concluding further agreements with one another to the detriment of the Colonial producer. In this connection particular attention must be paid to the attitude of Holland, under the leadership of Dr. Colijn, the Prime Minister, a Free Trader converted to the most effective protectionism and barter-trading. The Netherlands East Indies are direct competitors with the Colonial Empire at almost every point, and it must be remembered that we never even heard anything of the German-Dutch Agreement referred to above until it was actually concluded, and that the details have never been published and have become known to us only through leakages by trade channels.18. The problem of defensive action is one of considerable difficulty. Broadly speaking, trade aggression by a foreign country can be met in one of two ways, either by counter-aggression or by conciliation, that is, the grant of favours on a reciprocal basis.  But in both of these matters the Colonial Empire&apos;s
liberty of action is much circumscribed by the declared policy of Imperial Preference, and, in the case of certain dependencies, by international instruments, such as the Convention of St. Germain, which were concluded and are maintained in the interests of the United Kingdom, or, at any rate, not in the interests of the dependencies themselves.19. The inability of the Colonial Empire to take action in its own defence is also influenced by the nature of the Colonial import trade. Being almost entirely without manufacturing industries, the Colonial Empire requires little in the way of raw material. Its principal requirements are manufactured goods, and, to a less extent, food-stuffs. There are a few classes of goods of which Empire sources of supply are permanently (e.g., motor spirit) or for. the time being (e.g., tobacco) inadequate or non-existent, but of by far the greatest part of the requirements of the Colonial Empire there is an ample supply available from the United Kingdom or other Empire sources, and in most Dependencies there is both a will to buy within the Empire and such a measure of preference as ensures a large share, if not the whole, of the market to the Empire producer.20. The resources of a policy of counter-aggression are therefore to a large extent exhausted in advance; on the other hand, a policy of conciliation could be made effective only at the expense of existing Empire suppliers.21. If this were the whole story the position of the Colonial Empire would be indeed a lamentable one, but fortunately it is not. While the bargaining position of the Colonial Empire is, as indicated above, a weak one, unless the whole policy of Imperial Preference is to be modified or abandoned, the bargaining position of the United Kingdom vis-a-vis the great majority of foreign countries as exceptionally strong, and the opportunities of forcing countries which have a strongly favourable visible balance of trade with the United Kingdom to use the credits thus obtained to make purchases from the Colonial Empire are considerable and still to a large extent unexploited.22. Prima facie there is nothing unreasonable in asking the United Kingdom to use the power which she thus possesses to help the Colonial Empire, for, in so far as that power is not used to force an increase in the exports of United Kingdom goods to those countries, it simply runs to waste.23. I suggest, therefore, that it should be the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government (a) That in all trade negotiations between the United Kingdom and foreigncountries particular attention should be paid to securing at least equal treatment for Colonial products in all matters relating to duties, quotas, licences, &amp;c, and also to ensuring that in the case of articles of Colonial interest which are not of prime necessity (such as tea, cocoa and fruit), foreign countries shall admit the maximum quantity of such goods which is compatible with their trade position; and(b) That, if difficulties are encountered in connection with these requirements,it should be made plain that the United Kingdom will be as ready to use the bargaining power arising from her large purchases of foreign goods.to force foreign countries to give favourable treatment of the kind required to Colonial goods as she is to use that power in the interests of the actual products of the United Kingdom.(Initialled) P.
