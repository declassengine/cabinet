CONFIDENTIAL. A.0,305,BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.STATE OF TRADE - AUGUST,  1954.Summary of Reports,  submitted by members of the Board or Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some oases with statistloal lnfor^aTEIorTTrom other souroea.Overseas Trade.   Imports in August were  60.0 m. as comparedwith  56.7 m. in the previous August.       Exports of UnitedKingdom produoe and manufactures were  32.1 m. against 31.0 m., and re-exports  5.3 m. against  4.3 m. a year ago.The excess of Imports over exports for the eight months up to31st August was  187.9 m., and for the corresponding period lastyear  160.2 m.Employment.     The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at 20th August was 2,136,578, an increase of 10,318 as compared with 23rd July. The main variations were:-London...................    * 447South Eastern ............4-2,936South Western ............4-1,464Midlands  ................. 47,121North Eastern ............4-5,618North Western ............417,365Scotland ................ -16,572Wales  ...................- 8,061The estimated number of insured persons in employment at 20th Aupust was 10,170,000, an increase of 34,000 over the previous month, and of 376,000 over a year ago.The improvement in employment was most marked in coal mining, building, shipbuilding and ship repairing, tube manufacture and the manufacture of cocoa, ohooolate etc On the other hand employment declined In particular in the boot and shoe Industry and moat of the clothing trades, in the motor vehicle Industry and in the manufacturing section of the ootton industry.
Rail and Road Traffic.      During tho five weeks ended Snd September, railway traffic receipts increased by  531,000 (3.3J-S) over the corresponding period of 1933, the increase in passenger traffic being 2.4%, in coal, coke and patent fuel 5,9jt and in other freight traffic 3.6,..     For the 28 weeks ended 14th July, the tonnage of freight traffic increased by 13.9 m,  tons (10.4^v) as compared with the same period of 1933,Motor vehicles newly registered in July amounted to 24,502 an increase of 2,661 (l2j-o) over a year ago.      The increase comprised 1,821 private cars and 840 other vehicles.      5,393 motor-cycles wore newly registered, an increase of 17.5?i over the previous July.Finance.     Money continued easy and bill rates remained practically unchanged.     The price of gold appreciated during the month from 138s.Id. to 140s.ll^d., and of silver from 207/i6d. to SlVsd.     The Roosevelt silver policy has led to a marked increase in the importance and turnover of the London Silver Market. In the foreign exchange market the dollar fluctuated considerably and at one time reached 5.11^.      It steadied with the release of gold by the U.S.A. for export, and by the end&apos; of August had improved to 4c985//8,     The French franc remained steady around 76-^/32 I&quot;or the greater part of the month but by the end of the month had risen to 7417/32.C-qaXi-     The average weekly output of coal during the 13 weeks ended 25th August was 3,881,000 tons compared with 3,557,000 a year ago, being an increase of 9 i.      The average number of persons employed during this period was 766,400 against 759,200 a year before.     Home consumption of coal and coke in July was 11$ higher than in July,1933. Exports in August at 3,269,000 tons were 67,000 tons
more than a year earlier.    In the same month increased tonnages were consigned to Canada and the Scandinavian countries, hut exports to Prance, Italy,   -Germany and Egypt declined.    Imports of Polish coal into the Irish Free State again increased in July at the expense of imports from Great Britain and Germany.The prospects for the immediate future are &quot;regarded with growing confidence&quot;.IRON AND STEEL.    The outlook for the autumn Is considered to he favourable, even the export trade having recently shown some signs of expansion.    Owing to holiday influences the output of pig iron in August was less than in July; hut it amounted to 503,000 tons against 363,000 tons a year ago. Steel production, also less than in July^ was 667,000 tons as compared with 551,000.    Some increase in exports of pig iron is reported and, although exports of finished steel products are confined to small tonnages in the main, there has recently been some expansion in enquiries received.In Scotland the industry has regained the level which prevailed before the holidays.   The shipyards are busier, the tonnage launched on the Clyde in August being the highest for a considerable period.0n the North-East Coast the demand from the constructional engineering and building trade is well maintained although there has been some decline in business with carriage and wagon and motor-car manufacturers.    Export trade also shows some improvement.I11 Sheffield the outlook Is specially favourable.    The demand for stainless steel continues to be brisk, though mainly on home account.    Export trade, though still disappoint-ing, has increased slightly.In South Wales the makers of semi-finished material continue to be well employed and the tinplate market shows a slight improvement.    There is no indication of ?xny better demand for galvanised sheets and export business is dull.
Motor Trade.    In the home market, sales of private cars have bean well maintained although August is usually a dull month. Sales of commercial vehicles have been fairly satisfactory.      In the Australian, New Zealand and South African markets ground is being lost to United States cars through the exchange position and tha absence of adequate preferences for British cars.     There is no Improvement in the continental market.Machine Tools.     An active demand continues in the home trade but exports remain unsatiafactory.     Germany is prepared to buy certain classes of specialised tools but the difficulty of arranging for payment is almost Insuperable,     Total exports in August amounted to  183,000, of which  86,000 went to Russia as against  62,0C&apos;C in July and  76,000 in June.Lighter Metal Trades.     Cono.ltions in the architectural metal work industry are still very unsatisfactory, but nearly all trades are better than a year ago.     The small tools, needle and fishing tackle trades are wall employed, although competition is being fait in needles of cheap quality imported from Germany; the enamelled hollow-ware and lock trades are also doing better than was anticipated, and conditions are good in press work. In non-ferrous metals the continued fall In the price of copper has delayed the placing of orders;    there Is keen continental competition for overseas business.Electrical Industry.     During August 1,059 million units of electricity were produced, as compared with 928 million units a year before.     The percentage of productive capacity in use was again over 60$.     Orders for heavy plant both In tho home and export market were considerably larger than a year ago. Exports of light apparatus in August were  621,100 against  543,676 a year ago.     The recent increased demand in the home market is believed to have also continued.
Cotton.    The volume of new business has been abnormally low even for August.      Unemployment increased somewhat and weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners averaged only 41,000 bales against 47,000 in July.     There was little net change in prices of raw cotton, but the margin between Indian and American was further widened.There was little change in spinners&apos; margins for medium and fine yarns but there was some improvement in coarse yarns with the operation of the new agreement.      Spinners have been seriously affected by the suspension of deliveries to Germany.New business in cloth is difficult to transact.      The demand from the Near and Far Jast continues unsatisfactory but is fairly steady from South Africa and South America.     Compared with a year ago exports of yarns declined,      Exports of piece goods however increased by 13j .     Exports to most British Colonies were higher. In particular, the marked increase in the case of Malaya and the west Indies, appears to indicate that the quota policy is bearing fruit.     Exports to other markets except Germany were on the whole maintained.wool.     There was little change in the activity of the industry as a whole during Augusts     Raw v/ool prices continued to sag and this fall was reflected in the prices of tops and yarns which are now 8$ below the level of a year ago.      There has been some seasonal improvement in demand for manufactured goods, but not to the extent normally anticipated at this timeof year.Exports of tissues increased during August as compared with July (11.62 million sq. yds as against 10,50 million sq. yds). There was also a slight increase in the exports of tops, but exports of yarns declined slightly.Chemicals.      In the alkali and heavy chemicals section deliveries in the home market showed some seasonal decline, but
exports improved.     Sales of dyestuffs at home v/ere below those a year ago, but with an increase in exports, production remained at much the same level.     The market for coal tar products was quieter;    but the demand for wood distillation products improved and the outlook is promising.Soap, Oils and Kindred Industries.     A general improvement is reported, even the seasonal lull in the soap trade being less than usual.     The price of pure lard has risen substantially and the trade in edible compounds has benefited accordingly. The volume of business in raw materials transacted during August showed an improvement of 50fi over the corresponding period a year ago.Co-operative Trade,     The Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s sales for the 4 weeks to 11th August showed a decrease of 3,2$ as compared with the corresponding period of last year.     The weighted average of the wholesale prices of seven of the principal commodities has decreased by 3.05&amp; as compared with a year ago and retail prices have increased by 0.01$ on the same basis.Retail Trade,     The value of retail sales in July was 3.1$ greater than in July 1933 and as the aggregate increase for the five months ended 30th June was also 3;^ it would appear that slow but steady ^progress j.s being maintained.     The preliminary figures for August suggest the same conclusion.     The improvement was experienced in all areas;    in foodstuffs (where the aggregate increase was 4.3;&apos;) London suburbs showed a gain of 7,8^ and Scotland 4.6$;    in non-food departments London suburbs and West iSnd showed increases of 3,      and 2. 5$ respectively but the improvement In Scotland amounted to only 0.2,3.
SHIPPING.   The improvement shown in rates of freight in July continued in August.     The index number of shipping freights for August was 86.62 (1913 ^ 100) as compared with 79.02 in July and 75.98 in August of last year.The amount of tonnage laid up at ports in Great Britain and Ireland was 1,042,000 net tons at 1st July as compared with 1,079,000 tons at 1st April, end 1,959,000 tons on 1st July, 1933.     The reduction as compared with a year ago is almost entirely clue to scrapping and sales to foreigners.EMPIRE.Canadian Tr^de.   The economic situation, as measured by available data, showed further slight improvement in July. The index of business operations in July showed a slight gain over June, the average for the 3 months May to July being higher than       any time since the first quarters of 1931. The gain over the previous month in exports of copper and nickel was less than normal.     Zinc exports showed a decline but lead production showed an adjusted gain of nearly 5$ ande xports of silver also increased.     There was increased activity in the iron and steel and motor tyre industries, but the output of newsprint fell off.     The previous month&apos;s level of wholesale prices was about maintained.Australian Trade.    Total imports during July amounted to  6.8 m. (Australian currency)    being  1.4 m. more than a year ago.   - 103,011 bales of wool were received into store, of which 2,561 were disposed of.     Butter exports since 1st July amount to 5,363 tons, against 3,969 tons a year ago.     The quantity of wheat and flour   shlppact since the commencement of the season amounts, in terms of bushels of wheat, to 69.5 million bushels.South African Trade.    The rising value of gold is likely to have favourable repercussions within the Union, where the continued downward tendency of wholesale prices confirm the view
Board of Trade.4th October, 1934.that tho weakness of sterling is due to appreciation in gold values.     Imports of merchandise in July were higher th^-n in any month since October, 1930,  amounting to  5.6 m. against  4.1 m. a year ago.     Exports of merchandise were  1.5 m. against  1.7 m.,  and gold exports totalled  4.4 m, as compared with  4.8 m.      Gola production showed a farther increase.     Owing to unseasonable rains the maize crop is expected to be some 1,000,000 bags less than in earlier estimates, and owing to its low sucrose content the cane sugar crop is also expected to fall short of the estimate. The tobacco crop of the European growers is estimated at 15.2 m. lbs.
