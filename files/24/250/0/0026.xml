Private and Personal.As Ministers asked for a week in which to decide, I expected to receive their decision yesterday. This question has been further considered by the Cabinet, and they have decided that, should Ministers decline to accept and support the compromise proposals, no alternative remains but to pass an Order-in-Council here empowering you to impose quota by regulation. Order-in-Council is being-drafted on lines of model ordinance giving powers to Governor to regulate imports by quota. In the event of Ministers refusing compromise, Council will be held to pass this Order here next week.It is appreciated by Cabinet that it may be necessary to certify the Budget following this action.[10351]

This Mill employs thousands of hands when in full work. Quotas on foreign cloth will assist greatly, but any remission of existing duties favouring Indian or Empire goods will destroy mill.

Ends.(4)Telegram from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 22nd July, 1934.No. 144.   Secret.Ministers have now informed me that they have given full and detailed consideration to proposals in your telegram of 9th July and consider that to adopt them will have effect not only of enhancing prices beyond the level of the purchasing power of the poor of this country, but even of causing a probable scarcity in the supply of their clothing materials, since it appears that the United Kingdom is not at present likely to be in a position to supply the local market at all with many of the articles most used, of which there is at present no importation from the Empire.They have decided, therefore, with the utmost regret that they are unable to accept your proposals.(5)Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to theGovernor of Ceylon.(Sent 9 p.m. 23rd July, 1934.)No. 115.
