19Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   July 1934.SECRET. Copy No.     83197-A.(Also Paper No. C.O.S. 342.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.THE IMPORTANCE OF AIR RAIDS PRECAUTIONS.Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.THE vulnerability of this country to air attack is a matter which has been receiving a great deal of attention, not only in official circles, but also in Parliament and in the Press. It is an accepted fact that active air defence measures, that is to say, the operations of our own aircraft, whether employed on counter-offensive or close defence, and anti-aircraft guns and searchlights cannot guarantee immunity from air attack. A proportion of the hostile bombers must always be expected to reach their objective. Furthermore, it is not possible to provide air defences to cover all possible objectives within range of hostile air attack in this country. It is also possible that such active air defence measures as have been approved from time to time may not have been completed on the outbreak of war. It is even conceivable that the first hostile air attacks might be delivered before the existing air defence units were ready to act.There is, however, another side to defence against air attack, which consists of passive measures which can be taken for the defence of the civil population in general, and the protection of essential services and other organisations necessary for a continuance not only of the life of the country, but also for the effective prosecution of the war. This passive defence aspect of the problem is in its way as important as the active side. It is, in fact, an essential part of our air defence, and unfortunately one in which in many respects we are behind our continental neighbours.We are much impressed with the open activities in continental countries at the present day in connexion with the defence of their civil populations against air attack! Not only are steps being taken to educate the populations to the dangers of the situation and their conduct under conditions of hostile air attack, but legislation is being promoted and measures are being instituted, often at very considerable cost.We appreciate that plans are being unobtrusively matured in this country, but we feel strongly that, unless and until the general public are taken completely into the confidence of His Majesty&apos;s Government, any preparations which may be contemplated can be of little value. AVe are impressed with the fact that failure to take adequate measures of this kind in time of peace would undoubtedly increase the general disorganisation and demoralisation which might result from enemy air attacks, and would correspondingly reduce our national resistance and undermine the moral structure of the nation.We would urge strongly that preparations for air raids precautions should be pressed forward, and that the immediate education of the public should be undertaken. There is considerable agitation going on in the Press in regard to the danger of air attack, and we feel it is of particular importance that the[10244]
public should have a right perspective of the dangers to which they may be exposed and the action which can be taken not only to reduce the danger, but to minimise the moral and material damage which the enemy may hope to achieve.In a number of foreign countries exercises are carried out every year. We consider that exercises of this kind should form the most important part of the training of the population, and we would urge, therefore, that preparations are put in hand at an early date for the holding of an exercise next year to coincide with the annual air exercises by the Royal Air Force.We attach, as we have said, the greatest importance to air raids precautions being developed concomitantly with active defence measures, and we are convinced that to run the risk of air attacks being delivered against this country, for which the civil population and industry in general were unwarned and unprepared, might be to jeopardise at the outset the successful conduct of any operations in which we might have to take part.(Signed) ERNLE CHATFIELD.A.

Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  July 1934.SECRET. Copy No.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 2Q5th Meeting, held on July.5, 1934.-* * . -* * * * .....(2.) THE IMPORTANCE OF AIR RAIDS PRECAUTIONS.(CjLP. Paper No. 197-rA.) (Previous Reference : CI.D. Minutes of the 264th Meeting, Minute 2.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a report. by , the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee dealing with the importance of air raids precautions (C.T.D. Paper No. 197-A).SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD, in answer to; a question from Mr. ,Baldwin.said the gist of the Paper was in,the.paragraph at the bottom of the.first page. The Chiefs of Staff felt that steps ought to be taken-to, prepare for the protection of the civil population against air attack by some kind of public action. !It had been hoped that bombing might be avoided, but it appeared now to be inevitable, and, that being so, it was felt that we ought to educate the public so that they could stand up to attacks of this kind and resist them, and that they should have the whole matter in proper perspective. The Chiefs of Staff &apos;felt that these measures ought to be taken publicly, as was being done in other countries.SIR ARCHIBALD MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD entirely agreed. He thought the biggest danger was that the population might panic because they did not know what to expect or what to do. All other foreign countries were making the most open preparations, but so far ours had been kept secret. If we were to have a serious panic, it might upset the whole of our defence plans and produce a most serious situation.SIR EDWARD ELLINGTON entirely agreed, and. said there was also the point that it was considered desirable to hold exercises. in order to practise air raids precautions as regards first-aid, decontamination, and so on, and these exercises should be held concurrently with the annual air exercises of the Home Defence Force.In answer to a question from Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, he said that the exercises would be carried out under the direction of the Air Raids Precautions Committee by the general public and the local authorities. There would be dummy casualties, and so on.SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER suggested this raised a question of very large policy.Mr. BALDWIN thought the matter ought to be referred to the Cabinet, and he would deprecate the Committee of Imperial Defence endorsing the recommen-dation of the Chiefs of Staff at this stage.SIR JOHN GILMOUR, in answer to a question from Mr. Baldwin, said, broadly speaking, his Committee and himself were strongly in favour of publicity. There was a question which was being put to him on the 11th July, asking broadly that we should take action as was being done in other countries.   It[10270a]
would be necessary for him to give some answer to this question, and he hoped the Cabinet would be able to consider the matter before then. It was abundantly clear that, while the Air Raids Committees had been investigating a lot of problems, with the exception of the Red Cross, no instruction had been given at all..-. His attention had recently been drawn to a proposal by a Major Murphy, who was some time employed in the Chemical Defence Research Experimental Station at Porton, whereby he had entered into an agreement to write some articles for The Listener the first of which had already appeared and to deliver a broadcast, but it had been arranged with the British Broadcasting Corporation to postpone the broadcast for the moment. There was another point, also, which was that other independent bodies were now taking up this question on their own, and it seemed to him very undesirable that they should be allowed to proceed haphazard in a matter in which the responsibility ought to rest on the central Government. If anything was to be done in regard to a broadcast, it ought to deal not only with gas, but with damage from high explosives. He was very much against the segregation of gas, although this was the particular aspect in front of the public at the moment. He also had his anxieties from the police point of view. They had got no instructions and, while they might be able to help, they would be well occupied with other duties. It might be necessary to have some additional body to help to deal with the problem.LORD LONDONDERRY added that he had been strongly pressed in the House of Lords Debate the other day by Lord Mottistone on this question and, from what Lord Mottistone had said, it seemed that some statement was expected from the Government.SIR MAURICE HANKEY referred also to the great interest being taken in this subject by the International Red Cross and the appeals which had been made to all countries to do what they could.SIR JOHN SIMON understood Mr. Baldwin did not desire any expressions of opinion on this matter at the meeting.Conclusion.It was agreed To refer the Report by the Chiefs of Staff, dealing with the importance of air raids precautions, to the Cabinet for their consideration.******2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, July 5, 1934.
