Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 193 (34).CABINET.IMPERIAL DEFENCE POLICY.Interim Report by the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament dealing with air Defence.PARLIAMENT has more than once been informed that if our efforts to bring about disarmament did not finally succeed, the Government would see to it that in air strength and air power this country was no longer in a position inferior to any country within striking distance of our shores. Although we have not abandoned all hope of reaching some Air limitation within the next two years, the want of definite progress at Geneva is such that the Government have found it necessary to announce that a statement on the Royal Air Force will be made in the House of Commons before the Summer Recess.2. In these circumstances the Ministerial Committee, which, on the basis of the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee (CP. 64 (34)) has been examining the requirements of the three Defence Services from the point of view of Imperial Defence as a whole, has thought it necessary to anticipate its Final Report (which is nearing completion) by submitting to the Cabinet that portion of its programme which deals with Air Defence.Basis of the Programme.3. As the result of a most exhaustive Inquiry the Ministerial Committee recommend a programme of expansion of our Air Forces drawn up by the Chief of the Air Staff on the following basis : (1) The Force is to be ready for war in five plus three (eight) years;(2) A sum of not more than  20,000,000 to be assumed to be available in thefirst five years for this purpose and to be spread out over these years; (3) The scheme to take into account the needs of Home Defence, the fleet air Arm, Singapore and the Far East,* and also the need for reserves,but paying particular attention to achieving the maximum deterrent effect in distributing the programme.Programme Recommended.4. The actual programme recommended will provide a total of 40^ new Squadrons, as follows : (a) 33 Squadrons for Home Defence;(b) 3^ Squadrons for the Fleet Air Arm;(c) 3 Squadrons for Singapore;(d) 1 Squadron for the Far East, exclusive of Singapore.* The original basis was &quot; Singapore only in the Far East,&quot; but was subsequently modified. See paragraph i C.[10305]
5. The provision of these units will leave  1,200,000 within the total of  20,000,000, plus any savings which may accrue in the course of the five-year programme, for beginning the building up of a war reserve. This is a matter to which we return later in paragraphs 9 to 11.6. There are several points of importance in connection with this programme which should be within the knowledge of the Cabinet in taking their decision.Home Defence Squadrons.7. The strength of the additional air force which we recommend for Home Defence, as already mentioned, is 33 Squadrons, making an aggregate of 75 Squadrons for Home Defence. This compares with 10 new Squadrons recom-mended by the Defence Requirements Committee, which would make only 52 Squadrons for Home Defence in all. It is only fair to mention, however, that the Defence Requirements Committee had anxiously considered an addition of a further 25 Squadrons (most of which were intended for Home Defence) and had invited the Cabinet to give this matter very careful consideration before arriving at a decision (CP. 64 (34), paragraphs 28 and 29).8. In deciding to aim at an Air Force for Home Defence of 75 instead of 52 Squadrons we have taken into account both recent changes in the international situation and the trend of public opinion in this country. Since the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee was received on the 28th February, and up to the visit of M. Barthou to London on the 9th and 10th July, there has been an almost continuous deterioration in the European situation, and a good deal more evidence has become available as to the extent of the German plans for rearmament -ment in the air. In these circumstances it is no longer safe to delay the completion of our plans for Air Defence, and, in particular, a start ought to be made with the extension of the Air Defence Scheme to cover the wider area of the country within range of air attack from Germany.* At the same time, public opinion in this country is manifesting a good deal of concern as to our defensive arrangements generally, and there is a widespread desire for an increase in the Royal Air Force. In these circumstances we have come to the conclusion that the proposals of the Defence Requirements Committee are no longer adequate to the needs of the situation, and that public opinion would not be satisfied with the relatively modest increase they proposed, which would only have completed the original 52-Squadron programme announced ten years ago.9. The maximum sum which the Chancellor of the Exchequer finds it possible to contemplate for Imperial Defence requirements does not enable provision to be made for the expansion we recommend and at the same time to equip the air forces at home on the scale proposed by the Defence Requirements Committee, which was designed to enable them to operate continuously in the event of war in Europe within five years.10. We have devoted considerable attention to the question of the proper division of our available resources between the provision of new Squadrons and of reserve machines and armaments respectively.Considered from the point of view of the deterrent effect on Germany as a potential aggressor and from that of public opinion in this country, there is much to be said for the formation of as large a number of new Squadrons as possible. Apart from this, there are strong objections to piling up reserves of aircraft too soon. Development in aircraft design and construction is rapid in these days, and if types of machines require to be changed it would be very wasteful to have to scrap not only the first-line machines and their working reserves but also a large number of war reserve machines which perhaps would never even have been flown.On the other hand, there are obvious risks in the plan of &apos;&apos; putting all our wares in the shop window &quot; if pressed too far. For example, factory production of aircraft in this country is an ascertainable fact, and it may be assumed that in due course the intelligence departments of foreign nations would deduce that the output of machines was insufficient to provide the reserves required for main-* note. The extension of the Air Defence Scheme of Groat Britain will involve the provision of additional anti-aircraft guns and lights, the cost of which will be considerable and will fall on War Office Votes. The details of this expenditure, therefore, form part of- the military defence requirements, which are still under consideration.
taining and operating Squadrons in time of war. When this was realised, the value of the deterrent would be reduced. The reserve must be provided before an outbreak of war becomes imminent. There is also, of course, the obvious risk that war might break out suddenly and that the Royal Air Force, unprovided with reserves, would not be able to sustain operations on any considerable scale for more than a limited period.11. On balance, we have come to the conclusion that in present circumstances we should, in the main, concentrate on an expansion of the Home Defence Force in the early years. During this first stage we should make some provision for war requirements, the bulk of which, however, will have to be deferred to a later stage unless some change in the situation necessitates a speeding up. It is true that this will not give us an Air Force capable of sustained warfare within the five-year period contemplated by the Defence Requirements Committee. It will, however, provide the framework of such a Force, with those permanent elements such as personnel, aerodromes, buildings, workshops, and so forth, which take so long to provide in normal times. If necessity arises it will be possible to accelerate the provision of all the essential accessories. Above all, the mere announcement of a substantial increase would act as a deterrent to Germany and inspire confidence at home.  To this we attach the utmost importance.Fleet Air Arm.12. In the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee it was explained that &quot; The present Fleet Air Arm is short of the total capacity of the Fleet by 51 aircraft, of which 29 are a deficiency in Carrier-borne aircraft.&quot; Provision was accordingly made in that Report for 4 Aeroplane Squadrons under the Deficiency Programme. Provision for further Squadrons was also foreshadowed under the Naval Construction Programme. One Squadron of 12 aircraft is being provided for the Fleet Air Arm in the present year, and we have recom-mended an addition of 3-g Squadrons in order to complete the total to 51 by the end of 1938. The formation of the additional 3^ Squadrons includes no provision for any additional requirements for the Fleet Air Arm which will mature when the new Aircraft-Carrier, which is due for completion in 1938, is put into commission. To provide that complement (estimated at 72 aircraft), it would be necessary to form in 1939 at least three further Squadrons (36 first-line aircraft). This number, we understand, should be sufficient to provide the equipment for the new Carrier, taking into account existing Fleet Air Arm units which would be available for embarkation in the new Carrier by reason of one or other Aircraft Carriers being out of commission for refitting. Admittedly this arrangement is less satisfactory than would be the provision of the full establishment for the Carrier in 1938, but the financial situation is one in which all the needs of the Defence Services cannot be met within a five-year programme. As we are only dealing with a five-year programme, no provision is made for additional Fleet Air Arm requirements which will mature after 1938. There may, in addition, be a small requirement for the Cruiser programme 1934-35-36; but any provision for this service which would fall on Air votes can be found from the total allotment of  20,000,000 to the Air Ministry.13. In connection with the provision to be made for the Fleet Air Arm, we have given careful consideration to a proposal for an interchangeability of air units between the Fleet Air Arm and Home Defence Squadrons, with the object of forming a reserve for either service. We need not trouble the Cabinet with the technical details of this question, which are rather complicated. We remitted the question for investigation to a special Sub-Committee, which reported that at present it is inadvisable to assume immediate interchangeability between units of the Fleet and Home Defence respectively.14. In order, however, to test the suitability of the Fleet Air Arm to co-operate directly in home defence, and of Home Defence units to co-operate with the Fleet Air Arm in case of necessity, we recommend that the Admiralty and Air Ministry should concert experiments in training one or two Squadrons from the Fleet Air Arm and the Home Defence Air Force respectively to under-take the dual role and should report on the result to the Committee of Imperial Defence within a period not exceeding two years. In addition, the two Departments should examine the question of interchangeability in all its aspects, including that of design of aircraft.[10305] b 2
The Far East.15. The three Squadrons provided in our programme for Singapore are the same as recommended by the Defence Requirements Committee.16. Apart from Singapore, the Defence Requirements Committee recommended the provision of 7 Squadrons for the Far East (4 Squadrons for Hong-Kong and 1 apiece for Penang, Ceylon and Aden). It is with some reluctance that we find it impossible to include these Squadrons within our recommendations for the five-year period. The sum available for Imperial Defence, however, does not enable us to provide all these Squadrons at the same time as the forces we deem necessary for the other requirements described above, to which we attach even greater importance. Although our original instruction to the Chief of the Air Staff was to take into account the needs of Singapore only in the Far East, he asked us to include provision for one additional Squadron at Hong-Kong. Our recommendation takes the form than an additional Squadron should be allotted to the Far East, but this is subject to a recommendation that the Cabinet should postpone a decision as to its final destination until the Committee of Imperial Defence, advised by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, has been consulted.17. In putting forward the above recommendations there is one over-riding consideration to which we attach the greatest importance. The programme is put forward in the light of the international and financial situations as we see them to-day, taking also due account of the political situation and tendencies in this country. All these factors, however, are very fluid, and we think that our Defence position ought to be kept constantly under review. Our recommenda-tions are made on the assumption that this will be done, and that if it should be found at any time that there is any intensification of the danger from one quarter or another, whether in the East or in the West, or any other pronounced change in the situation, then the programme may have to be expedited or adjusted to the new circumstances. We add that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has felt bound to protect his position by observing that he is not binding himself or his successors to find the additional sums mentioned either within the five years or in the particular years to which they are allotted.18. We attach in an Appendix a Table showing the incidence of the proposed expenditure within the five-year period, but we strongly recommend that in any public announcement no reference should be made to the stages of the programme.Summary.19.   Our recommendations may be summarised as follows : (1) The provision of 40-^ new Squadrons of the Royal Air Force for the following services : (a) 33 Squadrons for Home Defence, making, with the existing42 Squadrons, a total of 75 Squadrons.*(b) 3^ Squadrons for the Fleet Air Arm.(c) 3 Squadrons for Singapore.(d) 1 Squadron for the Far East, exclusive of Singapore.(2) The above forces to be provided within five years from 1934, at a total cost estimated at  20,000,000. t The suggested annual instalments of the programme and their approximate cost are shown in the Appendix.* There may, in addition, be a small requirement for the Cruiser programme 1934-05-36 ; any provision for this service falling on Air votes can be found from the total sum allotted in Kecommendation (2).f The figure of  20,000,000 is exclusive of expenditure falling on Navy votes through the Fleet Air Arm grant-in aid.

(3) In order to test the suitability of the Fleet Air Arm to co-operate directly in Home Defence, and of Home Defence units to co-operate with the Fleet Air Arm, in case of necessity, the Admiralty and Air Ministry should concert experiments in training one or two Squadrons from the Fleet Air Arm and the Home Defence Air Force respectively to undertake the dual role, and should report on the result to the Committee of Imperial Defence within a period not exceeding two years. In addition, the two Departments should examine the question of interchangeability in all its aspects, including that of design of aircraft.(4) The decision as to the final destination of the Squadron recommended for the Far East apart from Singapore should be postponed until the Committee of Imperial Defence, advised by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, has been consulted.(5) Our Defence position ought to be kept constantly under review, and the programme recommended should be adjusted from time to time in the light of new factors in the situation. In particular, the Chancellor of the Exchequer does not bind himself or his successors to find the additional sums mentioned in this Report within five years or in the particular years to which they are allotted.Signed on behalf of the Committee :S.B.
