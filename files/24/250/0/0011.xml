Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 186 (34).CABINET.COLONIAL GOVERNORS&apos;  PENSIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN a Memorandum (OP. No. 300 (33)), circulated to the Cabinet in December last, I invited my colleagues to authorise the preparation of draft. legislation intended to correct certain anomalies which result from the existing provisions for the pensions of Colonial Governors, as regulated by the Pensions (Governors of Dominions, &amp;c.) Acts, 1911 and 1929.2. As it was found that there might be difficulty in securing acceptance of some of the proposals in that Memorandum, I agreed that consideration of it by the Cabinet should be deferred until those proposals had been further examined by the Departments more immediately concerned. After further consideration of the points which have been raised in the inter-departmental discussions and correspondence, I have now decided not to proceed with the proposal which was made in paragraph 10 of the Memorandum that the qualifying period for pension in case of ad hoc Governors should be reduced to five years. I am, however, still of the opinion that it is desirable that legislation should be introduced at the earliest possible date in order to improve the pension position of &quot; civil service &quot; Governors, a class whose case was discussed in paragraphs 5-7 of Cabinet Paper No. 300 (33). I there proposed that the Acts should be amended so as to reduce from ten to five years the qualifying period of service as a Governor which admits of pension being awarded according to the fixed scale on the retirement of a &quot; civil service &quot; Governor. The reduced period of five years was suggested so as to correspond with that proposed for ad hoc Governors, but, as the latter class are no longer to be considered, the question of the period of qualifying service can now be re-examined on its merits.3. The question is one of deciding the period of service which should be required from a Governor who has been a civil servant, before his promotion to a GoArernorship is reflected by an improvement in his pension position. It is the general rule in the public service that promotion should increase an officer&apos;s pension, but it is also well established that the full improvement in the officers pension position should not be realised unless he serves for a substantial time in his new office. For this reason it is usual to lay it down in the case of an officer who has been promoted within three years of his retirement that pension must be calculated upon the basis of his average pensionable emoluments during the last three years of his service. The pension system applicable to Governors makes it impracticable to apply an averaging rule in their cases, but the principle that full pension benefit is normally obtained three years after promotion would clearly seem to justify that length of time being fixed as the period of service after which a Governor may be awarded pension at the special rate appropriate to his office. My first proposal, therefore, is that the Acts should be amended so as to reduce to three years the period of service which a Governor who has been a civil servant is required to complete as a condition of the award of pension at the special rates laid down in the Acts.4. While this amendment would be extremely beneficial in some cases to the individuals concerned, the cases are not in themselves numerous, and the additional burden upon the Exchequer would not be serious.   It is estimated on[10289]
the basis of the experience of the five years from 1929 to 1933 inclusive that the additional charge which my proposal would impose upon the Exchequer&quot; in respect of pensions payable at any one time would not be likely to exceed  2,000 per annum. I feel that this expenditure would be fully justified not only as a matter of consideration for the Governors concerned, but on grounds of public policy. It is clearly undesirable but in present circumstances inevitable that a Secretary of State should be forced to hesitate before taking steps for the retirement of a Governor who for medical or other reasons is not fully efficient, because of the disproportionate loss in pension which retirement before completion of ten years would in most cases involve.5. I wish also to seek authority for an amendment of the Acts which would place a Governor transferred from the Sudan in the same position as one appointed from the Colonial or Home Civil Services. Such cases are not likely to be frequent, but it may upon occasion be in the public interest to appoint a Colonial Governor from the Sudan Service, and in that event it seems clearly undesirable that the possibility of making such an appointment should be influenced by the consideration that the officer concerned might be placed at a disadvantage in the matter of pension prospects. To this end the existing definition of &apos;&apos; the permanent civil service of the State &apos;&apos; would be extended so as to include civil service in the Sudan. All liability for pension in respect of service in the Sudan would, of course, continue to fall upon Sudan funds.6. I understand that every Department which might be in any way concerned with these proposals, or in which there might be repercussion from them, has been consulted and that no exception has been taken to my suggestions. I hope, therefore, that the Cabinet will authorise the preparation of draft legislation to give effect to those proposals, and that facilities for the passage of the Bill (which I do not believe would be controversial) may be afforded as early as possible.(Initialled) P. C.-L.Downing Street, July 9, 1934.
