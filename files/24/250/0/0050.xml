Printed jor the Cabinet.   October 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 225 (34).CABINET.WESTERN AUSTRALIA AND SECESSION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.AS my colleagues will no doubt have seen, the State of Western Australia has raised the question of secession from the Commonwealth of Australia, and a recent referendum has resulted in a considerable majority vote in favour of secession. A deputation is now on its way to this country carrying three petitions for presentation respectively to the King, the House of Lords and the House of Commons; the prayer of the petitions is, in brief, that legislation may be passed by Parliament to provide for the separation of Western Australia from the rest of the Commonwealth, and its constitution as a self-governing Dominion.2. A note on the history of the relations between Western Australia and the Commonwealth, with an account of the principal grievances (of which the most important are those connected with financial relations and with tariff questions) on which the Western Australian case is based, is contained in the annex to this memorandum.3. My own view of the situation is, in brief, that whatever grounds of complaint Western Australia may have, secession is not the right remedy. More-over, it is by no means certain how far the secession movement is genuine in the sense that it represents a really popular desire for separation from the Common-wealth. The movement is undoubtedly based, to some extent, on the idea that it forms the best means for advertising Western Australia^ grievances with a view to bringing stronger pressure on the rest of Australia, and particularly on the Commonwealth Government to take some special steps for their assistance. One remarkable fact is that at the same time that the referendum was held which resulted in a vote in favour of secession, a general election was held in Western Australia which returned to power the Labour party, one of whose principles (viz., the unification of Australia), was directly opposed to secession. Indeed, I understand confidentially from the United Kingdom representative at Canberra that the present Premier (Mr. Collier), while maintaining the position that he must take the necessary steps to give effect to the wishes of the people as declared in the referendum, does not in fact anticipate that the prayer of the petitions will be granted, though doubtless he hopes for an improvement in the financial support which Western Australia obtains from the Commonwealth.4. On the other hand, I gather that the attitude of the Commonwealth Government is likely to be one of uncompromising resistance to the petitions, and indeed of obstruction at every stage.5. In these circumstances, it is clear that, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom are concerned, we should do our best to maintain the attitude that this unfortunate controversy is- one which Western Australia and the rest of the Commonwealth must settle between themselves. Consequently, from our point of view, any action in regard to the petitions ought to be confined to the narrowest possible limits, and in any case ought not to be such as to expose us to the charge of taking sides. [10663]
6. As regards the petitions to Parliament, I have made certain enquiries as to procedure. I understand that in the Commons the appropriate course would be that presentation of the petition should be made by a private Member, and that thereafter steps should be taken for the setting up of a Select Committee to consider not the substance of the petition, but the question of its receivability; in other words, whether the State and people of Western Australia have the right to present a petition to Parliament. In reply to enquiries received both from the Agent-General for Western Australia and from the High Commissioner for the Commonwealth, I. have semi-officially informed them in the above sense.7. If this course is adopted, the Select Committee would no doubt afford an opportunity to the representatives of Western Australia to state their case on the question of receivability, and also to the Commonwealth authorities to reply if they so desired (the Commonwealth Government have already authorised the publication and wide distribution in Australia of a &quot; Case for Union &quot; in reply to the Western Australian &quot;Case for Secession&quot;); the Committee would probably also wish to receive the views of the Government here.8. In view of the last-mentioned possibility, I thought it desirable to consult the Law Officers of the Crown on the various legal and constitutional questions raised.   The questions which I put to them are as follows : &quot; (i) Whether the receivability by the House of Commons of the proposed petition would depend upon the power of the United Kingdom Parliament to legislate with regard to the subject matter of the petition and, if not, upon what it would depend;&quot; (ii) Whether, under existing conditions, the Parliament of the United Kingdom could legislate with regard to the withdrawal of an Australian State from the Commonwealth, without the request and consent of the Commonwealth Government (or Parliament),&quot; (a) as a matter of law;&apos;&apos; (b) As a matter of constitutional practice :&quot; (iii) If and when the Parliament of the Commonwealth legislates to adopt section 4 of the Statute of Westminster, whether the reply to question (ii) (a) and (b) would require alteration.&quot;*9.   The Law Officers&apos; replies are : &quot;1. The House of Commons is not bound by any rule as to the receivability of petitions whioh fetters its freedom to receive any petition it chooses : it would not, therefore, be accurate, in our opinion, to say that the receivability of the proposed petition would depend upon the power of Parliament to legislate with regard to the subject matter of the petition. It would depend upon the view which the House of Commons would take, probably after the matter had been considered by a Select Committee, as to whether it was convenient to receive the petition. No doubt the power to legislate would be a very important factor, but inasmuch as the question of the power to legislate could hardly be decided without a careful considera-tion oi the petition, it is unlikely, in our opinion, that a petition of this character presented by British subjects on behalf of a self-governing State within the Empire would not be received.&quot; 2. As a matter of law we are of opinion that, under existing conditions, the Parliament of the United Kingdom could legislate with regard to the withdrawal of an Australian State from the Commonwealth without the request and consent of the Commonwealth Government or Parliament. The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, 1900, is. in strict theory, as much liable to be repealed or amended as any other Act of Parliament; the provisions for the alteration of the Constitution which are contained in the Constitution itself (section 128) in no way affect the sovereign powers of the United Kingdom Parliament. Apart from strict theory of law, we are of opinion that the declaration of the Imperial Conference of 1926 &apos; that the constitutional practice is that legislation by the Parliament at Westminster applying to a Dominion would only be* note. I may mention that so far no steps have been taken by the Commonwealth to adopt any section of the Statute.
passed with the consent of the Dominion concerned &apos; is conclusive. It cannot be suggested that legislation with regard to the constituent members of the Federation forming the Commonwealth of Australia would not be legislation applying to the Commonwealth. Such legislation would require, as a matter of constitutional practice, in our opinion, the concurrence of the Commonwealth Government.&quot; 3. The adoption of section 4 of the Statute of Westminster by the Parliament of the Commonwealth would, in our opinion, take away from the Parliament of the United Kingdom even the legal power to pass legislation of the character proposed without the concurrence of the Commonwealth Government. It would require a very narrow and, as we think, a mistaken interpretation of the words of section 4 to enable it to be said that legislation altering the number of the constituent States of the Commonwealth was not legislation extending to the Dominions &apos; as part of the law of that Dominion.&apos; &quot;10. I suggest that, if a Select Committee of the House of Commons is appointed to consider the receivability of the petition and if the Committee should seek the views of the Government, the views should be those set out in the Law Officers&apos; replies.11. As regards the petition to the House of Lords, the procedure is, I understand, somewhat different. A petition is presented by a Peer, and the petition, after presentation, is ordered to lie on the Table. Any further steps regarding it are taken on the motion of a Peer. If it is desired that the petition should be referred to a Select Committee to consider, a Peer moves accordingly, and a Committee is then set up; such a Committee might, if the motion were so framed, consider both the question of receivability and the merits of the petition. In all the circumstances, it might seem convenient to attempt to defer considera-tion in the Lords, or at any rate the expression on behalf of the Government, of any opinion on the merits pending a decision by the Commons on the question of receivability.12. It will also be necessary at a later stage for advice to be tendered to the King in regard to the action to be taken on the petition addressed to His Majesty, but it would seem convenient that consideration of this question also should be deferred pending a decision as to the receivability of the petition by the House of Commons. In the meantime, I should propose, after formally submitting the petition to His Majesty, to arrange for a suitable interim reply to be sent to Western Australia.(Initialled) J. H.

A N N B X.11958/69. No. PROOF.HISTORICAL  NOTE   ON   THE  RELATIONS  BETWEEN  THE   STATE  OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA AND THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.Western Australia and the Commonwealth Act. The federation of the Australian States into the Commonwealth of Australia was effected by an Act of the Imperial Parliament in 1900. The Government of Western Australia had shown considerable nervousness at entering the proposed federation and, at the time of the passing of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, had not yet invited the people of Western Australia to express their opinion by means of a referendum on the question of union with the other States. The older settled districts of the Colony near Perth were unwilling to relinquish the right to impose their own tariff and it was only the insistence of the gold-mining districts which finally induced the Government of Western Australia to withdraw the amendments to the Constitution which they had previous^ insisted upon, one of which would have given Western Australia control of her own customs tariff for, at any rate, five years alter federation. The gold-mining districts favoured federation for sentimental reasons (they had been largely settled from the other States of Australia) and because they hoped that, as a result of federation, railway development and communications generally would be improved to their advantage. A referendum was eventually held in Western Australia in 1900 and resulted in a majority in favour of federation. The Constitution Act (63 and 64 Vic. Chap. 12), after declaring in the preamble that the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania had agreed to unite in one &quot; indissoluble federal Commonwealth &quot; under the Crown, had provided that the Queen might, by proclamations declare that those people were so united, and also that the people of Western Australia might be included in the Proclamation if the Queen was satisfied that they had agreed thereto (Section 3). As the result of the referendum, the Proclamation was issued by the Queen on the 17th September, 1900, stating that Her Majesty was satisfied that the people of Western Australia had agreed to be united in the Commonwealth, and proclaiming that on and after the first day of 1901 the six States should be united in a Federal Commonwealth.The Position of the States under the Commonwealth Act.The opposition of the Government of Western Australia had been overcome partly b3&apos; internal pressure as already indicated, and partly by the inclusion in the Constitution of what the Government regarded as adequate safeguards for the interests of the State. These safeguards were not peculiar to Western Australia but were equally desired by others, if not all, of the remaining States. The principal safeguards were contained in the following Sections:  Section 7 by which each State was to be represented equally in the Senate of the Commonwealth Parliament.Sections 51 and 107 by which the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament were enumerated, and it was provided that all powers not exclusively vested in the Commonwealth Parliament should remain with the Parliaments of the States.Sections 87, 89, 93, 94, 96 and 101 by which it was attempted to ensure that the States should not be financial losers as the result of the division of powers. Section 87 provided that for ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth three-quarters of the customs revenue was to be returned to the States. Sections 89 and 93 that until and for five years after the imposition of uniform customs duties the Commonwealth should pay monthly to the States in proportion to their population any surplus in the Treasury and Section 94 that the Common-wealth Parliament might alter the basis of the distribution of the surplus if it thought fit after that date. Section 96 that the Commonwealth Parliament might grant financial assistance to any State during a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provided. Section 101 that &quot; there shall be an inter-State Commission with such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance within the Commonwealth of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce and of all laws made thereunder &quot;.The apparent object of these provisions may be summarized as being (a) to limit the powers of the Commonwealth vis-a-vis the States, (6) to ensure that one House of the Commonwealth Parliament should act asthe guardian of the interests of the States, and (c) to make good to the States as far as possible, during the first years of federation, such losses as they might suffer as the result of the transfer of the sole right to levy customs duties to the Commonwealth.Australian Constitution-(C. 15213/9).   3.   125.
The Development of the Financial Relations between the Commonwealth andthe States.(a). As regards taxation, the Commonwealth share of taxation has steadily increased in proportion to the total tax revenue in Australia. In 1910 a Commonwealth Land Tax was introduced, in 1914 an Estate Duties Act, and in 1915 the Income-Tax Act. During the War a War-Time Profits Tax and Entertainments Tax were added, but were subsequently repealed. In 1930 a Sales l&apos;ax of 5 per cent, of the sale value of goods subject to the tax was imposed in order to meet the deficit which had been caused by the financial and economic crisis. The effect of this taxation can be seen by a comparison of the revenue raised in 1911 and 1933. In 1911 the Commonwealth raised  1,400,000 by direct taxation; this had increased to  22,100,000 in 1922, and although it was subsequently decreased to  13,800,000 in 1933, Sales Tax in 1932-33 realized  9,300,000 in addition. During the period from 1923 to 1933 the Commonwealth Government also raised an average of  37,000,000 annually from customs and excise duties. In 1911 the States collected in direct taxation  4,200,000 and in 1933,  31,700,000. The proportion of Commonwealth to State direct taxation has therefore increased from between one-quarter and one-third to one-half or over.(6). As regards financial assistance from the Commonwealth to the States, the temporary provisions of the Constitution for the allocation of the customs revenue between the Commonwealth and the States have lapsed in course of time. As a result the Commonwealth has been able to decide the basis and the amounts of any payments to the States and even to acquire a measure of control of their finances. In 1910 the Surplus Revenue Act substituted a payment to the States of 25s. per head of their population in each year for the three-quarters of the revenue raised from customs and excise which had had to be paid by the Commonwealth Government to the States during the first ten years of federation. Under the new system the States received  5,600,000 in 1910-11 as against  8,100,000 in 1909-10. The capitation payments increased to  7,000,000 by 1926-27 but in 1927 the Commonwealth Government passed the States Grants Act by which per capita payments were to cease as from 1928. Under the terms of the Financial Agreement Ratification Act 192S, in return for a lump sum fixed at the 1926-27 total, which was in future to be paid by the Commonwealth towards the interest and sinking funds of the existing and future public debts of the States, responsibility for the latter was taken over by the Commonwealth Government. Any amount beyond this sum required to meet the interest and sinking fund payments was to be paid by the States and control of the raising of loans was in future to be vested in a Loans Council which was to decide each year the amount which it was desirable to raise. This sum was then to be allocated between the Commonwealth and the States. The ability of the Commonwealth Government to enforce the payment by a State of the sum necessary to enable the Commonwealth to meet the interest payments due was demonstrated when New South Wales attempted to default in 1931. The direct effect of the Financial Agreement Act was that after 1929 the States would receive a sum which was about one-fifth of the average sum raised by the Commonwealth from customs duties, and which might be expected to be a decreasing proportion in future 3&apos;ears, as compared with the three-quarters which they had received prior to 1910.As regards the other sections of the Constitution designed to safeguard the finances of the States, Sections 89, 93 and 94 had provided for the distribution to the States of any surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. This responsibility the Commonwealth avoided in 1909 by the expedient of formally appropriating (but not then spending) its real surplus and paying it into a Trust Fund from which invalid and old age pensions are paid. The legality of the practice was affirmed by the High Court. It was not until June, 1934, that, influenced by the agitation for secession in Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania, the Commonwealth Government decided to allocate  2,000,000 of its budget surplus to the States. Section 101 provided that &quot; there shall be an inter-State Commission &quot; for the execution of the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and a Commission was established in accordance with the terms of the Inter-State Commission Act of 1912. By Part III of this Act the Commission was given the duty of investigating &quot; the effect and operation of tariff Acts and it might have proved useful to the States for ventilating their grievances at the working of the customs tariff during the post-war period. No Commission has, however, been appointed for the past eleven years. Section 96 which provided that the Common-wealth might grant financial assistance to any State is optional, and the question of special grants is dealt with more fully later. There is no question, however, that Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania have felt themselves aggrieved by the absence of grants for many years and by the amount of such grants as they have been subsequently given.
The Commonwealth Constitution also provided (Section 114) that &quot; A State shall not impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to the Commonwealth nor shall the Commonwealth impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to a State &quot;. It was, however, decided in a test case by the High Court of Australia that this prohibition did not operate to prevent the Commonwealth from imposing customs duties upon goods and materials imported by a State Government as a customs duty was not held to be a tax within the meaning of this Section. The result has been that the Commonwealth Government has obtained large sums by way of customs duties on goods imported by the States for development purposes, usually as the result of the raising and expenditure of a State loan, e.g., in 1924 ten locomotives and twenty-two boilers were purchased by the Western Australian Government Railways for  121,600 from State loan funds, and on these a customs duty of  32,000 had to be paid.Failure of the Senate to Safeguard the Position of the States.The apparent intention of the Constitution was that the Senate (on the model of the United States Senate) should be specially representative of &quot; State rights &quot;. In practice, however, the Senate has tended to be assimilated to the House of Representatives as representing Federal rather than State interests, and has shown itself prepared, in certain circumstances, to pass legislation adversely affecting the position of the States as such. The explanation lies in the divergent economic interests of the States. New South Wales and Victoria, with the majority of their population engaged in secondary industries, and Western Australia and South Australia, which are primarily interested in wheat, wool, and mining, are at the opposite extremes. (Queensland with its large tropical plantations, and Tasmania with its fruit-farming, stand somewhat apart, though the interests of Tasmania generally bring her into line with Western Australia and South Australia.) In dealing with the economic legislation of the Commonwealth, the most important branch of which is the customs tariff, these divergent interests appear most clearly. Yet it is in questions affecting the customs tariff that the House of Repre-sentatives, which is elected on a population basis, is most likely to give effect to the views of the large industrial centres of New South Wales and Victoria at the expense of the sparsely settled agricultural and pastoral States. Bills affecting finance and customs must, moreover, originate in the House of Representatives and can only be passed or rejected, but cannot be amended, by the Senate. In practice therefore the only Bills to reach the Senate on customs and financial questions are Bills which give effect to the wishes of New South Wales and Victoria, and they can be subjected only to destructive criticism and not to constructive amendment. The Senators from New South Wales and Victoria normally support the Bills and their passage depends merely on whether the Government can secure the support of one-quarter of the remaining Senators. In this connexion another political practice which was probably not foreseen by the States becomes of importance. Elections to the Senate, as to the House of Representatives, are now fought on party lines and the loyalty of Senators to their individual States is further obscured. In the event it usually happens that the sponsors of the Bills succeed in whipping up enough support among the party&apos;s Senators from the remaining States to secure the passage of the Bill. If opposition is likely to be strong, the inclusion in the Bill of some provision likely to be of assistance to one of the other States can be effective. Queensland, for example, has been able to take advantage of her strategic position in the Senate to secure protection throughout the Commonwealth for the products of the sugar, banana, and pineapple plantations and the rice-fields of North Queensland, and the virtual exclusion from Australia of imports of similar products from tropical countries outside the Commonwealth. Queensland, in fact, is effectively committed to the maintenance of the protective policy favoured by New South Wales and Victoria.The Effect of the Protective Tariff.The fruit of this situation has been the rapid extension of the tariff during the post-war years. The Commonwealth has adopted the protection of home industries as a national policy, and duties have been imposed on goods imported into Australia with a view, not merely to revenue, but to raising the cost price of imports in Australia to a level at which Australian manufacturers are themselves able to produce them. The annual production of the secondary industries has, in consequence, increased in value from  65,000,000 in 1917 to  150,000,000 in 1930. The factories have, however, been concentrated in the large cities of New South Wales and Victoria and although a few have been established in Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania, in Western Australia the secondary industries have, if anything, tended to decrease.
The burden of the tariff has conversely been spread over the whole of Australia. It was estimated in 1925 that the added cost of manufactured articles to the Australian public was about  36,000,000 per annum or  6 a head of the population, and it is probable that the present burden is considerably over this amount as the duties on imported manufactures have been extended and increased since those years. Moreover, the development of secondary industries in New South Wales and Victoria has not indirectly benefited the States other than Queensland to any important extent by pro-viding a lai-ger home market for their primary produce. Except for a few commodities the market has been more than adequately supplied by the farmers of New South Wales and Victoria. Eighty per cent, of the total exports of Western Australia, for example, have continued to be sent abroad, and the burden of the tariff to that State can be estimated from the figures for imports and exports from Western Australia to the rest of the Commonwealth. Western Australia imports from the other States goods to the value of  10,000,000 but those States take Western Australian produce to the value of only  1,500,000 a year in return. The position of South Australia and Tasmania is similar. In Queensland, on the other hand, the development of the northern part of the State was made possible only by the imposition of high duties on imports of competing produce from tropical countries outside Australia, and the closed home market has been sufficiently large for prosperous plantations to be developed. But to Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania the prosperity of Northern Queensland has added only another burden. It is estimated that the added cost to Australia of sugar alone is  7,000,000 a year and although the greater part of this is borne by the larger consuming States of New South Wales and Victoria, the additional burden to the other three is appreciable.The situation of Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania has been made the more difficult by the fact that the largest increases in the Commonwealth tariff have occurred in the past ten years. During this period the tendency of the prices of raw materials in the world market has been to fall steadily and heavily. The export price in Western Australia of wheat per bushel fell from 6s. lOd. in 1925 to 2s. Gd. in 1931, and of wool per lb. from Is. lid. to Sd., and between 1917 and 1930, the total value of mining and pastoral production in the whole of Australia decreased by  14,000,000 annually. Each increase in the tariff has therefore meant an added burden to the primary producer at a time when his net income has been steadily falling.The British Economic Mission of 192S summed up the situation in their report by saying: &quot; The most vexed and most important of all Australian questions is that of the cost of production with its effect on export industries, and of the combined effects of the tariff and the Arbitration Act. Their effects and that of the Navigation Act have placed an unduly heavy burden on the unsheltered primary industries, particularly in Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania &quot;.Alternatives before Western Australia.There are four possible remedies for the disabilities which Western Australia has experienced.(a) The Commonwealth tariff might be so amended that it no longer imposes soheavy a burden upon the primary producers. (b)&apos; The return to the primary producers might be increased by an extended system of export bounties. (Under   (a)   or   (b)   it   would  probably   be   necessary   also   for   some assistance to be afforded to State finances by means of grants from the Commonwealth Treasuty.) Alternatively Western Australia might be removed from the scope of the Commonwealth tariff either(c) by being granted tariff autonomy for a period of years or(d) by secession from the Commonwealth of Australia.The first possibility, the reduction of the Commonwealth tariff to a level at which the burden on the primary producers would be appreciably lightened, does not appear likely to occur in the near future. The secondary industries in New South Wales and Victoria have been built up on a basis of high protection and if this protection were to be reduced, a number of the industries would certainly succumb to competition from countries outside Australia, and the industrial workers in the remaining industries would have to submit to a very considerable reduction in their present standard of living. The outcry with which any proposal to reduce even the heaviest duties is greeted is an indication of the difficulties which would lie before any Commonwealth Government
which attempted to give effect to such a policy. It has already been mentioned that the majority of the members of the House of Representatives are elected by New South Wales and Victoria and, in consequence of the political influence of these States, both the United Australia Party and the Australian Labour Parties are pledged to the continuance of the existing policy of protection of the secondary industries. Unless there is a redistribution-tribution of the population of Australia, not only between States but between the country districts and the cities, it will never be possible for the only party which stands for a reduction of the tariff, the Country Party, to obtain an absolute majority in the House; while even if the Party forms part of a coalition Government it is unlikely that its influence would be sufficient to secure drastic tariff reductions.A beginning has, however, been made with a bounty system. The fall in prices of raw materials was so serious by 1930 that the Commonwealth Government found it necessary to give bounties to a number of primary products. The first Act provided for a bounty on exports of wine which was not to exceed Is. 9d. per gallon, and il was followed by other Acts in the same year providing for bounties on flax and linseed, the total not to exceed  20,000 per year, and on gold at the rate of  1 per oz. of fine gold produce above the average production of the immediately preceding years, and for a reorganization of the bounties on cotton. An Act of 1926 had provided for bounties not to exceed a total of  180,000 a year on the production of cotton and cotton yarn in Australia, and the total was increased to  260,000 by the Act of 1930. The financial crisis of the next two years, however, resulted in drastic cuts in the bounties. The Financial Emergency Act of 1931 reduced all bounty payments by 20 per cent, and the Act of 1932 went still further. The wine bounty was reduced to a maximum total of  96,000, the amount per gallon being reduced from Is. 9d. when the total exports would otherwise have required additional expenditure, and the gold bounty was not to be paid until the price of gold fell below  5 per oz. in London. Fortunately for the Commonwealth Government the rise in the price of gold caused by the increased demand for it throughout the world has so far obviated the necessity of any payments. As a result the bounty system is still in its infancy in Australia but in its development to assist primary producers who are dependent on the export market at times when world prices of their produce are unremunerative, there is a possible means of com-compensating the producers for the burden which they share of the tariffs imposed to protect the secondary producers in Australia.Grants from the Commonwealth Treasury to certain State Governments would probably be necessary to supplement the benefits which the individual producer would receive from either a lower tariff policy or a bounty system, because the finances of the State Governments have, as already indicated, suffered directly as well as indirectly since the establishment of the Commonwealth. But in the absence of one or other form of compensation to the primary producer, the system of grants to the State Governments has been regarded by both the States and the Commonwealth as the most suitable form of compensation to the former for the deterioration in their financial position and it has been in force for many years. The views of the Commonwealth and the State Governments as to the amount of the grants has, however, seldom coincided, and it was not until certain States were threatened with bankruptcy and the Commonwealth Government had acquired, through the Financial Agreement, a direct interest in their solvency that grants began to be made which were sufficiently large to be regarded as a serious contribution to their revenues. The agitation for secession had meanwhile developed and it is a striking, though perhaps not a curious, fact that this has been most successful during the last two years when the grants from the Commonwealth have been largest. The Surplus Revenue Act of 1910 provided that Western Australia should be given by the Commonwealth a special grant of  250,000 in addition to the per capita payments due to the State under that Act. This grant was intended to compensate Western Australia for the burden of the tariff which was already recognized to be heavier there than in the other States. The grant was, however, to decrease by  10,000 in each of the succeeding ten years, at the end of which period it was to terminate. The immediate post-war period was one of considerable prosperity and it was not until prices began to fall and the State budget was again unbalanced that it was possible to convince the other States that further assistance to Western Australia was not merely justified but necessary.A Royal Commission was then set up, in 1924, by the Commonwealth Government to consider the whole question of the effects of federation upon the finances of Western Australia, and their report recommended that the Commonwealth should make to the State a special payment of  450,000 per annum to commence as from the 1st July of that year.   The Commonwealth Government made no payment, however, until 1926-27
when a special grant of  565,000 was made. An annual grant was subsequently made from 1927-28 to 1931-32 of  300,000. This grant has been increased in 1932-33 to  500,000 and a grant has been arranged for 1933-34 of a similar amount, supplemented, for the latter year, by a further special grant of  100,000 in order to enable the State to keep its deficit within the limit fixed by the Loans Council.Grants have also been made to Tasmania and South Australia. In 1928 Tasmania was given a grant of  220,000 which was increased to  250,000 in 1929 when it was provided that the increased grant should continue for five years. In 1932 and 1933 additional grants of  80,000 and  130,000 were also made to Tasmania. South Australia was given a grant of  360,000 in 1929 with the proviso that it should be decreased to  320,000 for each of the succeeding two years. Additional grants were, however, made in 1930 of  850,000 and in 1931 of  680,000. In 1932 the grant was increased to  1,000,000 and in 1933 to  1,150,000. It has already been mentioned that in June, 1934, the Commonwealth Government decided to allocate  2,000,000 of their budget surplus to be divided between the States. This sum is to be allocated on a population basis; the share of Western Australia is  133,000, making, with the special grant of  600,000 referred to above, a total grant of  733,000 to Western Australia.The third possibility is that Western Australia should be given control of her own customs tariff for a period of years.The Royal Commission which considered the finances of Western Australia in 1924 had only recommended a grant, however, until Western Australia should be given by the Commonwealth Parliament the absolute right to impose its own customs and excise tariff, subject to the limitation that the duties on imports from the Eastern States should not be higher than the duties on imports from overseas. The actual words of the report were:  &quot; That whatever benefit the Commonwealth protection policy may have conferred upon other States of the Commonwealth, it has not benefited Western Australia; that it is impossible to give the primary producers of the West relief by way of reduced customs duties without impairing the secondary industries in the East, and that the only effective means of removing the chief disability of the State is to restore to the State, for a period of years, the absolute control of its own tariff &quot;.If, however, such control were granted to Western Australia, a very good case for a similar concession could undoubtedly have been made by South Australia and Tasmania, and as the extension of the concession would have involved impairing seriously the protective policy of the Commonwealth Government, the recommendation was not taken seriously at the time.In the succeeding years prices of raw material continued to fall, and the finances of both the States and the Commonwealth revealed increasing deficits. The grants made by the Commonwealth Government to Western Australia, Tasmania, and South Australia were smaller than those recommended by the Commissions which had inquired into their finances at a time when they were more prosperous, and individuals in all three States began to advocate secession as the only solution of their difficulties.Secession is the fourth possibility and it has undoubtedly found most favour in Western Australia which is geographically the most isolated State. The strength of the feeling in favour of it finally induced the Government of Sir James Mitchell to agree to a referendum in 1933. The referendum resulted in a vote of 138,653 to 70,706 in favour of secession and although Sir James Mitchell&apos;s Government was defeated at the State Election held at about the same time, his successor, Mr. Collier, felt obliged to abide by the result of the referendum and to examine the possibility of giving effect to it. A Committee was accordingly set up to prepare the case of Western Australia for secession, and a delegation is to lay a petition from the Western Australian Parliament requesting the necessary amendment of the Commonwealth before the Parliament at Westminster.Secession has also found considerable support in South Australia and Tasmania. Mr. Butler, the Premier of South Australia, stated, in April, 1933, that he believed that if South Australians had the opportunity, they would vote for secession from the Commonwealth. He interpreted the feeling of the people to be one of bitter resentment at their treatment by Commonwealth Parliaments and Governments over a period of years. And Mr. Ogilvie, the new Labour Premier of Tasmania, announced his intention in June of this year to investigate thoroughly the handicaps of Tasmania under federation and, if necessary, to hold a referendum on the question of secession.
 JO 476The Case of Western Australia.In support of the present movement in favour of secession a lengthy &quot; case &quot; has been drawn up by a Committee appointed for the purpose by the Legislature of Western Australia. The &quot; case &quot; was approved by the Legislature in March, 1934, and has since received a wide circulation.The document is somewhat diffuse and not very clearly arranged. The main contentions are, however, based on the grievances of the State referred to above in respect of the financial relations with the Commonwealth and the tariff issue.The Commonwealth Reply. Subsequently the Commonwealth Government set up a Committee to prepare a reply. The work of this Committee called &quot; The Case for Union &quot; was-published in July. The document attempts to traverse on certain points the contentions put forward on behalf of Western Australia; but the main lines of argument may be summarized as being (a) that the difficulties from which Western Australia is suffering as the result of her dependence on the export of primary products are due not to federation but to the world depression, (b) that Australia forms a natural unit of sufficient size to exercise influence in world affairs, and that the prospect of securing a fair share in international trade for the future would be greater for Western Australia as a part of such a unit than as a small independent unit.Dominions Office,September, 1934.
