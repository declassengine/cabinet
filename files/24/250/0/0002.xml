E C R E T.P.  177(54) . COPY NO:      Q CLCABINET. BELGIUMaSUGGESTED DECLARATION REGARDING.I am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to circulate to the Cabinet the accompanying record of a Conversation between himself and the German Ambassador, on July 3rd,  1934.(Signed) M.P.A.HANKEY Secretary to the Cabinet., Whitehall Gardens,  S.W. 1, July 5th,  1934.At the interview which I had with Herr von Hoesch to-day, something was said about Belgium, but I do not propose to include it in a despatch to our Ambassador at Brussels as it might only embarrass him if he is questioned.    Herr von Hoesch has twice recently referred to the willingness of Chancellor Hitler to enter into non-aggression pacts with Belgium, and we have news that the Belgian Foreign Office were somewhat distressed at the suggestion made by the Belgian Minister at Berlin that these advances had been made at our request and with our approval.    I therefore took the opportunity of telling Herr von Hoesch that this did not quite correctly represent the position.    We had naturally
enquired as to German intentions in view of Chancellor Hitler&apos;s previous declaration of willingness to enter into non-aggression pacts with all his neighbours,  and we should be glad to  see anything done which would contribute to confidence and more neighbourly feeling in that part of the world.    Our own obligations under Locarno and our own traditional concern in the integrity of Belgium gave us a special interest in the matter, and we thought it might be a good thing if Belgium was reassured, and naturally desired that if anything of this sort happened it should happen in a way which would carry with it the approval and support of Germany.    The Ambassador knew that Monsieur Hymans had been over here, and naturally inferred that the subject had been mentioned.    I said this was so, though only in general terms, and I added that in fact it had not been the subject of communication between ourselves and Prance.(Intld.)    J.S.5rd July, 1954.
