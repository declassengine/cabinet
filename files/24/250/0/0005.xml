Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   June 1934.SECRET.A.R.P. (O.) 380.(Also Paper No. A.R.P. (P.) 26.)COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Air Raids Precautions (Organisation) Sub-Committee.PROPOSAL FOR A BROADCAST DEALING WITH GAS ATTACKS UPON THE CIVIL POPULATION.Report.1. AT the last meeting of the Sub-Committee held on Tuesday, the 5th June, 1934, our attention was drawn to the fact that a Major P. Murphy, some time Director of Experiments at Porton, had come to an arrangement with the British Broadcasting Corporation for the delivery of a broadcast Address and the communication of a few articles to the Listener, on the subject of gas attacks upon the civil population.2. We have, in previous Reports,* urged strongly the need for complete freedom as regards publicity, in order that the general schemes which we have worked out may be translated into detailed plans by the various authorities concerned, and as a result of these representations we have been permitted considerable latitude. We do not feel, however, that we are in a position, on our own responsibility, to authorise publicity of the kind which would be involved in the arrangement referred to in the preceding paragraph.3. Major Murphy, although he has not been directly concerned with recent research development at Porton, no doubt possesses sufficient qualifications to enable him to deliver a broadcast and to write a series of articles on the subject of gas attack. In our view it would be a great pity to miss the opportunity of giving effect to the arrangement, though we think it essential that the texts of Major Murphy&apos;s broadcast and articles should be seen by a responsible authority before they are publicly issued.4. We should also like to draw attention to the growing demand among certain sections of the public for guidance in matters concerning passive air defence generally. Voluntary attempts on the part of individuals or societies either to organise themselves or to make provision for lectures and instruction are being frequently brought to our notice. As matters are at present, it is very difficult for us to do anything to help in these cases, though, where possible, unofficial guidance is given. We feel it would be unfortunate if these efforts, from lack of any official support, come to nothing, or, conversely, that they should develop on the wrong lines. The information which we have been receiving only goes further to strengthen our conviction that the time is more than ripe for some more definite statement of the Government^ policy in regard to passive air defence than has hitherto been deemed possible.5. Although we have recommended that Major Murphy should be allowed to carry on with his proposed broadcast arrangements, provided the subject-matter is first submitted for consideration, we suggest, for the consideration of the Policy* Papers Nos. A.R.P. (0.) 40 aud 17o.[10175]Copy No.
Sub-Committee, the possible desirability of arranging for a broadcast by a Minister or responsible Government official. Any such arrangement, apart from the increased value which would attach to an official pronouncement, would offer the special advantage that it would enable the subject of passive air defence to be treated as a whole instead of being limited to the gas aspect of the problem.6.   Our recommendations, therefore, may be summarised as-; follows/:^-&apos; , v.(a) That Major Murphy should be permitted to give his proposed,,broadcastand to contribute articles to the Listener dealing with the subject of gas attacks upon the civil population, provided the material of these addresses is first considered by the appropriate authorities in order to ensure that it is suitable and accurate in all respects.(b) That there is a growing and spontaneous demand for official guidanceconcerning matters appertaining to passive air defence generally in the country, which demand cannot properly be satisfied until existing conditions are removed, and that, in consequence, we would again urge that the question of removing the existing ban on full publicity should be favourably considered.(c) That it is for consideration whether there might not be great advantage in a general broadcast talk on passive air defence by a Minister or responsible Government official.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,R. R. SCOTT, Chairman.(Signed)      E. J. Hodsoll, Secretary.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, June 15, 1934.
