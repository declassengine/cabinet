BBC RET.Copy No.,P.195(34)CABINET, UNITED KINGDOM-NETiiERLANDS TRADE NEGOTIATIONS * Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The Cabinet will wish to know something of the circumstances in which I have found it desirable to conclude a temporary modus vivendi with the Netherlands Gov eminent governing our trade relations with that country.The primary cause of the recent negotiations was the declared intention on the part of the Netherlands Gcv ernment to use their quota system for purposes of bargaining, allotting different quotas to different countries according to the treatment which those countries were prepared to accord to the products of the Netherlands.     In this policy they were taking a leaf out of the French book, but whereas in the case of Prance we were in a position to claim (though the claim was contested by the French Government) that we had a treaty right to equal treatment in the matter of quotas with all other foreign countries, the existing Treaty between, this country and the Netherlands contained no clause conferring most-favoured-nation rights on either party in the matter of prohibitions or restrictions, although such rights were accorded in the xaatter of customs duties.The Netherlands Government originally proposed to reduce substantially,  in some c..ses by as much as seventy per cent.,   the quotas for a large number of goods in which we were interested, and only to restore them in return for specific concessions, but it was ultimately arranged that negotiations should ta^e place and that pending the negotiations there should be a &quot;standstill&quot; during which the existing quotas for our goods should be maintained,-1-
whilst we on our part would.abstain from imposing any new duties on goods in which the Netherlands %ere substantially interested.      In the light of this understanding we have in fact abstained   from putting into force certain increases of duty (e.g. on strawboard and fruit pulp) which have been recoiimended by the Import Duties Advisory Committee.In the discussions which have taken place it early became evident that the essential object of the Dutch negotiators was to secure the admission into this country of substantially larger quantities of agricultural and horticultural products, as well as reductions of duty and other guarantees in regard to duties on products of an industrial character.      The admission of larger quantities of agricultural products from the Netherlands ^ould, however, only have been possible if we had been prepared to admit very much larger quantities from other countries who are entitled by treaty to benefit froja any increases  accorded elsewhere.     17e were, of course, prepared to give an undertaking (such as appears in other recent agreements concluded on behalf of His majesty&apos;s Government) that in the administration of our agricultural policy we would have regard to the share in those products which the Netherlands have had in the past.      The Dutch negotiators did not, however,  regard this undertaking as of sufficient importance to justify them in according generous treatment to our goods.      In fact    the offers they put forv/ard in regard to the quotas of particular manufactures that they would undertake to allow to be imported from this country were such as we could not possibly have accepted as part of a detailed commercial agreement.     The quantities proposed in the case of many products (notably textiles) were, indeed, substantially smaller than those we have exported to the Netherlands in recent years.
In the circumstances the Netherlands negotiators, having failed In their aim, proposed a modus vivcndi &quot;based om the recent agreement with Prance.    This modus Vivendi is embodied in an Exchange of Notes which tool: place on July 20th and which seceres to us for all quotaed imports the share which we enjoyed in the basic period.    V/e have, of course, given a corresponding undertaking, &quot;but whilst the agreement represents on the side of the Netherlands a complete reversal of the policy of &quot;bargaining which they had initiated,  it merely continues, so far as we are concerned, the policy we have consistently pursued.    Certain technical points of quota administration, with which I need not trouble the Cabinet are also dealt with in this temporary arrangement.It is to he observed that whereas in the negotiations with Prance the French Government insisted on certain assurances in regard to our customs treatment of their silks and other products, we have in the present case secured equitable treatment in the matter of quotas without giving any such assurances.   Moreover, &quot;both parties now resume complete liberty of action in regard to customs duties so that the inconveniences under which we have laboured under the &quot;standstill&quot; arrangement will be brought to an end on the first of next month, when any new duties which the Import Duties Advisory   Committee recommend can be put into early operation.Sc far as Dutch Customs duties are concerned, these are at present low, though it is no doubt possible that the Netherlands Government may embark shortly on a policy of further protection.   I shall, of course, continue to watch the situation from this point of view.    In any event the existing arrangement can &quot;be terminated at any time on three months&apos; notice and provision has been made for facilitating future discussions on matters of interest to either Government.prd of Trade,I   20th July, 1934.
