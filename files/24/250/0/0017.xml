Ever since the inception of the Transitional Payments Scheme, Burnsley has been a source of anxiety to my Department, the reports of their administration showing that in disregard of their legal duty they were determining amounts much in excess of what they woitld themselves have given by way of public assistance and, in many cases, where the person concerned had resources, much in excess of what could be justified by any reasonable standard.The negotiations culminated in a definite warning to the Authority that, under Article 7 of the Order in Council, a Commissioner would be appointed to administer in their stead.      In March, 1933, however, a deputation was received from the Public Assistance Committee as the result of this warning, which was headed by Mr. Herbert Smith who v/as at that time Mayor and Chairman of the Public Assistance Committee.     Mr. Herbert Smith gave an undertaking that he would personally see to it that all cases where excessive determina-tions had been given would be reviewed and that administration would continue on reasonable lines.     This undertaking was loyally carried out, but at the last Municipal Election Mr. Herbert Smith was defeated and, although he has since obtained another seat, he has ceased to take any active part in Public Assistance and Transitional Payments administration.Since the elections matters have become progressively worse.      On 13th November resolutions were passed by the Public Assistance Committee the effect of which would have been to set at nought the requirement of the Order in Council that Transitional Payments should be determined on the basis of an applicantts needs.     The illegality of these resolutions was at once pointed out in a firm letter from the Department and the Committee then rescinded the resolutions.      It now appears from reports received by the Department that the rescission of the resolutions was meaningless and that the Public Assistance Committee are now in fact issuing determinations of Transitional Payments at the full unemployment benefit rates in all cases, irrespective of the resources of the applicants.     This action renders nugatory, so far asIgRBT COPY MO.      S*P7l92(34). CAB I N E I,ADMINISTRATION OF T;.l^transitional PAYMENTS AT BARNSLEY.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.
65    IBarnsley is concerned, the whole Transitional Payments Scheme and can only be construed as a direct and deliberate defiance of the law.I am satisfied that the movement in Barnsley is oolitical and designed to discredit the Unemployment Assistance Board and make its workImore difficult.      The administration of transitional payments there is outstandingly bad and the proper remedy is to supersede the Authority and appoint a Commissioner.     The only doubt I have felt is whether such action would bo likely to deter the Authorities of similar tendencies or on the contrary to encourage them.     After consulting the Minister of Health I am convinced that the supersession of the Barnsley Authority would have a deterrent and. beneficial effect.I xarcijose, thex&apos;efore, unless my colleagues dissont^to give the Barnsley Authority immediate warning that I shall appoint a Commissioner to administer Transitional Payments in Barnsley unless within a fortnight the Council bring their administration into conformity with the law.(Intd.)     0.   S.16th July, 1954.H.Q.379 - 70.CD.
