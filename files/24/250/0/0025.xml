Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 200 (34).CABINET.REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON COMMERCIAL AIR TRANSPORT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THERE is one important point in connexion with the Report of this Committee to which, in fairness to my colleagues and myself, I feel bound to draw attention.Not only the success but even the establishment of an Air Mail scheme on the lines of that outlined in the Committee&apos;s Report depends on the whole-hearted co-operation of the Dominions. It also involves financial contributions on a considerable scale, and for these Dominion Ministers will have to secure the approval of their Parliaments.I fully realise that a scheme under which Imperial Airways would be solely responsible for the organisation of the services throughout the Empire would be at the same time simpler and more economical and more acceptable from the purely United Kingdom point of view. But we must face conditions as they are, and Australia and South Africa, at any rate, would, I think, not be likely to be satisfied with an arrangement under which the control would rest with the United Kingdom Government, while they would merely make contributions to the United Kingdom Exchequer for the cost of mail services, on a proportionate basis.In other words, I anticipate that there will probably be a demand for a greater measure of participation by them in respect of that part of the through service which covers their own territories, and possibly adjacent territories, or, alternatively, that they will expect to organise the homeward mail services, while leaving us to organise the outward mail services. In either event, there would have to be considerable adjustments in the scheme.The conclusion which I draw is this: It seems to me essential that the scheme outlined in the Report should be presented to the Dominions not as the only possible one, but as the one which, from the United Kingdom point of view, would seem the most efficient and economical, and our negotiators should have a wide latitude in conducting the discussions with the Dominions.(Initialled) J. H. T.Downing Street, July 23, 1934.[10346]
