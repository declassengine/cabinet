DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF .HIS BRITAIN IC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT. T.222(34). COPY NO. cabinet.THE LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY. PRESENT POSITION. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE. AND FISHERIES.1. Tho Emergency Scheme for the assistance of the cattleindustry, incorporated in the Cattle Industry (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1934, has now been in operation for over a month, and my colleagues may like to have a short review of the position.2. Prior to the passing of the Act on July 31st, draftarrangements for carrying out its previsions had been framed in consultation with an Advisory Committee, representative of the various interests concerned in the sale of fat cattle. 3. The Cattle Committee, for which provision is made inthe Act, was appointed on the day on which the Act received the Royal Assent.     Its Report on Arrangements was presented to Ministers on August 10th and approved the same day. 4. The Committee, under the Chairmanship ofSir John Chancellor, and its staff, worked at high pressure during August and as a result it was possible to bring the scheme into full operation throughout the United Kingdom on September 1st, the earliest day permissible under the Act. 5. The arrangements for the certification of cattle atapproved centres and for the payment of the subsidy of 5/- per live cwt. have worked smoothly from the outset.     823 Livestock Certification Centres (including 70 in Northern Ireland) have been approved and 30 Dead-weight Centres.     Special arrangements
have been made in the more remote parts of Scotland to enableproducers to claim payments.     Up to and including 3rd Octoberpayments of  232,104 have been made in respect of 97,564cattle, an average of  2. 7. 7d. per animal.Supplies.    The rate of marketing of fat cattle is indicated by the figures of fat cattle offered at representative marketsin England and Wales.     The numbers offered in the four weeksending -august 29th, 1934 were 31,125 compared with 29,150 inthe same period of 1933.     There v/as therefore no holdingback of supplies for securing the benefit of the subsidy.In the subsequent five weeks marketings have beena good deal heavier than in the corresponding period of 1933,the respective figures being 52,168 and 41,014, showing anincrease of 27 per cent.     Important factors in the situationare the scarcity of grass and the prospect of higher feeding stuff prices.     The scarcity of grass was in fact foreseenand taken into account in the estimates taken for the purposeof framing the supply programme for July-December 1934 whichwas put before the Dominions at the end of July.     The officialbeef import figures for September ar,e not yet available buta preliminary estimate, based on the arrivals of importedbeef carcases, suggest that imported supplies were about 10per cent, greater in September 1934 than in September 1933cPrices.   The following table shows the course of fat cattleprices in August and September of 1933 and 1934.Prices of Fat Cattle in England &amp; Wales (Average 1st and 2nd Quality) Per Cwt.

Fat cattle prioes in July w$re practically the same as in the previous July, but throughout August prices were about 3/- per cwt. higher than in August 1933.     The subsequent drop - amounting to more than half the subsidy rate of payment - is no doubt associated with the heavier rate of marketing.     The decline in prices, however, has not been abnormal, the steady autumn prices in 1933 being quite exceptional.     It must be expected that prices will weaken further in sympathy with still heavier marketings of cattle off the autumn pastures, but the outlook generally is not unsatisfactory, provided overseas supplies are reasonably regulated.     The improved prices in the mutton and lamb market continue.Pork prices are favourable to producers at the moment, but it is to be anticipated that prices will fall heavily in the near future.(Intld .)
