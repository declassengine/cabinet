DEFENCE REQUIREMENTS.Report by Ministerial Committee.(As amended and approved by the Cabinet at their Meeting on July 31, 1934 Cabinet 31 (34), Conclusion 1.)I.-INTRODUCTION.IN accordance with the instructions of the Cabinet on the 2nd May, 1934 (Cabinet 19 (34), Conclusion 2), we have continued the examination of the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee (CP. 64 (34) ), which the Cabinet have already begun. We have devoted thirteen meetings to the subject, making, with seven meetings of the Cabinet, a total of twenty meetings. The Prime Minister and the Lord President of the Council were absent from several of our earlier meetings owing to their pre-occupation with the Committee of Parliamentary Privileges, and the former had left London for reasons of health before the final stages of the enquiry. The First Commissioner of Works was added to the Ministerial Committee on the 2nd May, 1934, and has taken part in our investigations. We take this opportunity to thank the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee for a number of valuable Reports on questions we have addressed to them.  A list of members of the Committee is given in Appendix I.2. It will be recalled that, in order to focus the discussions, the Prime Minister circulated to the Cabinet a questionnaire (CP. 70 (34)), which was discussed at a series of meetings of the Cabinet over which the Prime Minister himself presided. The results of these meetings have been taken into account in this Report.3. In the earlier sections of this Report the proposals of the Defence Requirements Committee are dealt with on their merits from the point of view of strategical requirements and the policy at which we should aim irrespective of finance and political expediency. In Section VIII, which contains our detailed recommendations, the two latter factors are given due weight, and the programmes and instalments recommended, as well as the priorities and time limits for their completion, are adjusted to these practical aspects of the question.II-THE  PERMANENT  PROBLEMS  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.4. At their meeting on the 14th March (Cabinet 9 (34), Conclusion 13) the Cabinet endorsed the recommendation of the Defence Requirements Committee (CP. 64 (34), paragraph 3) that-&apos;&apos; our long range policy cannot be founded exclusively on what might prove to be a temporary and shifting basis.....&quot;as interpreted by the following explanation in paragraph 17 of the same Report: &quot; For all three Defence Services there are certain general requirements irrespective of where they have to operate, e.g., for the maintenance of our sea communications, which is the first principle of Imperial Defence, a main fleet to provide the shield behind which our cruising forces are able to protect our merchant ships, as well as suitably disposed and adequately defended bases; for our Army and Air Force, a nucleus of strength sufficient to safeguard our responsibilities in any theatre of war until any necessary expansion can be carried out, as well as safe sea communications and ports of embarkation; for all three Services, sufficient supplies, reserves and ancillary services of all kinds.&quot;The intentions of the Defence Requirements Committee in this matter are explained in greater detail in paragraph 13 of their Report as follows : &quot; We have also strictly applied the second assumption laid down for us, that we need not incur expenditure on measures of defence required to provide exclusively against attack by the United States of America, France [10354] &quot;X b 2
or Italy. But we recommend that this should not be interpreted to rule out the provision in certain localities of a limited amount of modern equipment required to enable personnel to be trained and exercised with modern weapons. For example, we accept the view of the Chiefs of Staff that it should be the aim to provide category &quot; A &quot; defended ports with at least one battery capable of engaging a capital ship. It would also be unsound to allow any of our Naval bases to fall to so low a degree of efficiency that it would be impossible to bring them up to a suitable standard within a reasonable time should changes in the political situation in Europe make this necessary.&quot;5. We are of opinion that the Cabinet &apos;s decision of the 14th March, as interpreted by the explanations quoted above, still holds good in respect of our long range defence policy, and in this Report we have not overlooked this aspect of the case.III.-THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.6. In accordance with an instruction from the Cabinet on the 15th November, 1933 (Cabinet 62 (33), Conclusion 5), the Defence Requirements Committee worked on the assumptions that, for the present, the expenditure of the Defence Departments should be governed by the defence of our possessions and interests in the Far East, European commitments, and the Defence of India, and that no expenditure should at present be incurred on measures of defence required to provide exclusively against attack by the United States of America, France or Italy. We recommend that these assumptions be reaffirmed. Even with these limitations, however, the expenditure involved in the recommendations of the Defence Requirements Committee is of such dimensions as to involve grave questions, both financial and political.7. Recognising that large armaments are not a satisfactory or reliable method of promoting international stability and peace, much less of achieving the ultimate result of reducing armaments, which are the declared objects of British policy, we have, at every stage of our enquiry, sought to discover whether security cannot be obtained in a more durable and satisfactory form, by political means such as international co-operation or the improvement of our relations with particular countries. Progress in these directions, however, as shown in later paragraphs, is not easy at the present time owing to the general disillusionment following the failure of the Disarmament Conference, the growth of armaments in foreign countries (especially Germany), and other factors in the international situation.8. While we are strongly in favour of seizing any opportunity to promote peace and the reduction and limitation of armaments, we cannot at the moment foresee any development of this nature which is likely to enable us to avoid considerable expenditure in re-equipping our defence forces.IV.-IMPERIAL DEFENCE:   DEFENSIVE REQUIREMENTS AS AFFECTED BY THE FAR EAST.9. In dealing with the situation in the Far East, the most striking feature of the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee is the extent to which our Empire security depends on the avoidance of hostilities with Japan. In the absence of good relations with that country, owing to the technical deficiencies in our defensive arrangements, an actual menace would exist to-day. In these circumstances, the Defence Requirements Committee (CP. 64 (34), paragraph 12) recommended that we should envisage &quot; an ultimate policy of accommodation and friendship with Japan, and an immediate and provisional policy of &apos; showing a tooth &apos; for the purpose of recovering the standing which we have sacrificed of recent years.&quot;We agree in the importance of improving relations with Japan. The possibility of our being menaced in the Far East at a time when we might be faced with a dangerous situation in Europe is one that we ought to do all we can to avoid.
It would involve war on two widely separated fronts, and would strain our resources to the uttermost.10. While there is evidence that the Japanese Government is as anxious as we are for good relations, we are still far from friendly co-operation, and definite approaches to Japan with any hope or prospect of concrete results are surrounded with the utmost difficulty. The approach of the difficult Naval Disarmament Conference in 1935, the intractable commercial and economic problems confronting the two countries, and Japan&apos;s intention to leave the League of Nations at the earliest permissible date, place formidable obstacles in the way of immediate steps in the desired direction, and as yet it has not been found possible to formulate a specific proposal for implementing the suggested policy. In the meantime, every opportunity is being taken by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to show goodwill towards Japan.11. We recommend that this policy should be continued. Pending its fruition, and, indeed, in any case we cannot ignore the very serious weakness of our defensive position in the Far East, as disclosed in the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee (CP. 64 (34), paragraphs 18-21), which the Cabinet has already approved as a general statement, though not as a catalogue of requirements, or a programme for execution (Cabinet 10 (34), Conclusion 5 (a)). Given the present mentality of the Japanese nation, we agree with the Defence Requirements Committee that Japan is more likely to respect and listen to a Power that can defend its interests than to one that is weak.12. At.the moment, from a politic:d point of view, we see no reason to apprehend danger in the Far East, unless Japan should spring another surprise on the world. The real difficulty is that, from a technical point of view, our defensive position in the Far East is precarious for the following reasons :  -(1) the naval deficiencies disclosed in the Report of the Defence Require-ments Committee;(2) the naval base at Singapore the pivot of Imperial Defence in the Far East is incomplete and provided as yet mainly with improvised defences;(3) the important outpost of Hong Kong is not properly equipped even within the limits of the Washington Treaty; (4) the fuelling stations on the route to Singapore (particularly Trincomali)are inadequately defended.Thus the whole of our Imperial Defence arrangements in the Far East are thoroughly unsatisfactory.Empire Aspects of Far East Defence.13. The matter has important Imperial aspects. The Dominions of Australia and New Zealand are especially concerned, since, on the advice of the Committee of Imperial Defence, their defensive arrangements are built up on the assumption that the main British fleet, operating from a properly equipped base at Singapore, will provide for the security of their territory and communi-cations against all attacks except sporadic cruiser raids. India is equally affected. The arrangements for the defence of Indian territory and trade against attack from overseas are based on the same assumptions as in the case of Australia and New Zealand. In addition, the maintenance of sea communica-tions for purposes of reinforcement and supply is vital to the whole system of military frontier defence in India. The British Colonies, Dependencies and Protectorates in the Far East are equally interested in the maintenance of our position. Even the Union of .South Africa and the East African Colonies would be gravely affected by even a temporary eclipse of our naval position in the Far East, and Canada would not be unconcerned.14. This dependence for security of that vast portion of the Empire whose shores are washed by the Southern Pacific and Indian Oceans on the maintenance of our naval position in the Far East has long been recognised, and, apart from general co-operation in Imperial Defence, several of the Far Eastern units of the
Empire have made specific efforts in connection with the problem under consideration. The Commonwealth of Australia, for example, is co-operating in our naval effort by the maintenance of substantial forces incorporated in the Royal Australian Navy, and has begun the modernisation of its coast defences. New Zealand maintains a special division of the Royal Navy and is, we understand, about to begin the modernisation of its coast defences. In a strategical sense the naval forces of the two Dominions are completely linked up with the Royal Navy as exemplified by the recent Naval Conference at Singapore. India has for many years contributed  100,000 annually towards the maintenance of the East Indies squadron, in addition to certain measures of local naval defence. The following contributions have been promised, and for the most part paid to the Singapore Base : New Zealand ... ... ...      1,000.000Federated Malay States       ... ...      2.000.000Hong Kong ... ... ... 250,000The Straits Settlements.   Land worth... 146,000 (with more-   to come).Total       ... ... ...      3,396,000We should mention also that the Union of South Africa has started to modernise its coast defences. Although this appears to be only remotely connected with the Far Eastern problem, it is valuable owing to the importance of our sea communications via the Cape of Good Hope, in case of the blocking of the Suez Canal.15. On the 11th October, 1932, the Cabinet authorised the Admiralty to proceed with the naval base at Singapore, and on the 12th April, 1933, it was decided, largely owing to the difficulties with Japan over Manchukuo, to expedite the completion of the first stage of the defences. The present Admiralty programme is designed to enable the base to function in 1940. The Defence Requirements Committee proposals aim at accelerating this by two years. The first stage of the defence programme for Singapore is to be completed in 1937. In addition, provision has been included in current War Office estimates for making a beginning with the defences of Trincomali. Plans have also been worked out for modernising the defences of the other defended ports in the Far East, all of which are provided for in the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee.16. The provision of naval bases and fuelling stations is, however, but a means to an end the mobility and freedom of action of our fleet. Even for our present fleet the naval deficiencies disclosed in the report of the Defence Requirements Committee are very serious, and it is relevant to point out that an efficient mobile fleet is not only essential to our defensive arrangements in the Far East, but also an example, second to none in importance, of those permanent elements in Imperial Defence referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Report. The completion of our naval equipment is essential if the other defensive measures undertaken by the United Kingdom and other parts of the Empire are to possess any value.17. On merits, therefore, so far as financial exigencies allow, we consider that His Majesty&apos;s Government ought to aim at the following desiderata-provision for which is included in the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee :-(i) The completion of our worst naval deficiencies.(ii) Proceeding with the programme already approved by the Cabinet forthe completion of the Singapore Naval Base and the first stage of the Naval, Military and Air Defences.   -(iii) Completion of the defences of the outpost of Hong Kong.(iv) Completion of the defences of other fuelling stations in the Far East.The extent to which this is possible, having regard to considerations of finance and domestic policy, as well as the time over which the available expenditure will be spread, are dealt with in Section VIII.
V.-THE POSSIBILITY OF INTERNATIONAL MEASURES FOR SECURING PEACE IN EUROPE.18. Before dealing with the defensive requirements of the Empire as affected by the position in Europe it will be convenient to summarise the deliberations of the Cabinet and of the Ministerial Committee with a view to discovering some political means by which the international situation might be ameliorated, and the heavy expenditure recommended by the Defence Require-ments Committee reduced. .19. On the 19th March the Cabinet recorded the following provisional conclusion on this subject: &quot; If the Disarmament discussions do not end in agreement and even if there is an agreement involving substantial rearmament of Germany  Germany&apos;s power may soon be great enough to make her a potential danger to others, and in these circumstances the Cabinet must without delay consider the following courses (which may not be complete alternatives) : (i) joining in arranging to provide further security against breach of the peace;(ii) facing very heavy further expenditure on armaments.It is recognised that there may be other alternatives to be considered in addition to those mentioned.&quot;   (Cabinet 10 (34), Conclusion 3.)20. Both the Cabinet and the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament have devoted much attention to the first alternative mentioned in the above Cabinet conclusion.21. The first proposal considered was one formulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer with the aim of promoting among the nations of Europe that general sense of security against aggression which is an essential foundation first and foremost of peace, secondly of any scheme of disarmament, and thirdly of the restoration of international trade in which, as the greatest exporting nation, we have the greatest interest. This scheme contemplated the creation of some kind of international partnership in Europe under which each&apos; signatory -would undertake to supply a specified force, but with limited liability, for use against an aggressor, thus providing a powerful deterrent to aggression and so promoting a sense of security. The Committee were attracted by this proposal and examined it in detail, but, in existing international conditions, it was not found possible to proceed with it.22. Another proposal to which we have given careful consideration is one submitted to the Cabinet on the 16th May by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 137 (34)), and a variant thereof by the Parliamentary Under -Secretary, Foreign Office, for a Convention, to be signed by the States of Europe, undertaking not to drop bombs from the air on one another&apos;s territory, whether in peace or war, together with a sanction in the form that, if any party violated the agreement, the other signatories would undertake to employ their air forces to vindicate the Convention and to restrain the wrong-doer by a&apos; general bombing of the State which breaks the Convention.23. The case against this proposal is set forth fully by the Secretary of State for Air in a Memorandum that was also before the Cabinet on the 16th May (CP. 138 (34) ). Among the difficulties brought out during our discussion of these proposals are the following : (i) The act of bombing a breaker of the Convention would constitute an act of war and would involve us in general hostilities;
; (ii) We might find ourselves involved in war in connexion with some dispute in which we had no direct concern in some remote part of Europe, such as Poland, a contingency which His Majesty&apos;s Government have always taken great pains to avoid; (iii) To put forward a proposal of this kind would involve long drawn-out discussions which might not only involve us in loss of prestige, but would also prevent His Majesty&apos;s Government from carrying out measures for rectifying the worst deficiencies of our defence forces which are essential to our security.24. In view of these and other objections, we see great difficulties in putting forward a European Convention against air bombardment in a form which we could recommend either as practicable or acceptable to public opinion in this country.25. Although we were unable to recommend an initiative based on either of the above proposals, a certain amount has been done during the last two months towards promoting security in Europe. On the 30th May, in pursuance of a Cabinet decision of the 9th May, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs took the opportunity of a speech to the General Commission of the Disarmament Con-ference to reaffirm the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to carry out the Locarno Treaty.(*) The meetings of the General Commission resulted, inter alia, in the setting up of a special Committee at Geneva to &quot;conduct such preliminary studies as it may consider appropriate in order to facilitate the conclusion of further agreements of the same nature (regional security agreements) which may be negotiated outside the Conference.&quot; This Committee has since presented a preliminary Report. A sequel to the meeting of the General Commission of perhaps even greater importance was the proposal for a regional Mutual Assistance Pact for Eastern Europe, which, in the form in which it emerged from the conversations between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and M. Barthou in London on the 9th and 10th July, 1934, is based on the same principles as the Locarno Treaty. These proposals, while avoiding any new commitments on our part, reaffirm Anglo-French co-operation, and at the same time safeguard us against any suspicion of joining in the encircle-ment of Germany. The plan has been brought into close relation with the problem of armament agreement, and does everything possible to foster any hope that remains of a practical result at Geneva. It is being followed up through diplo-matic channels. (See also paragraph 42 relating to the recent declaration of our interest in Belgian integrity.)26. Whatever may be the result of the efforts summarised above, we are of opinion that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not be deterred by past failures from seeking fresh opportunities to promote peace in Europe and to bring about the reduction, or at least the limitation, of armaments. In the meantime, how-ever, in view of the accumulating evidence that Germany has started to re-arm in earnest, we are strongly of opinion that it would be unsafe to delay the initiation of steps to provide for the safety of the country. In other words, it is necessary to consider the Cabinefs second alternative quoted in paragraph 19.VI.-HOME   DEFENCE :   DEFENSIVE   REQUIREMENTS   AS AFFECTED BY THE POSITION IN EUROPE.27. The seriousness of the position in Europe arises from the failure of the Disarmament Conference, the decision of Germany to leave the League of Nations, her barely concealed intention to rid herself of the Treaty of Versailles, the uncertainties attendant on an inexperienced and unscrupulous dictatorship, and the obvious intention of Germany to re-arm. The cumulative result of these manifestations, following the failure of the League of Nations in Manchuria and the Chaco dispute, has been to create a state of tension and loss of confidence throughout Europe greater than at any time since the War.(*) &quot;And ns to Locarno, I think it is well understood that what His Majesty&apos;s Government have promised they will perform.&quot;
28. So far as German armaments are concerned, the position is stated in the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee (paragraph 11) as follows : &quot; Germany, on the other hand, is not yet fully airnied. She has consider-able elements of force, but her permanent system, with its full complement of armaments and trained reserves, has not yet taken shape, though it is rapidly doing so. Surrounded by armed and suspicious neighbours she is not at present a serious menace to this country, but within a few years will certainly become so. It will, indeed, be impossible to have any confidence in German gestures to the outside world so long as every German act at home belies them. In her case we have time, though not too much time, to make defensive preparations.&quot;29. We emphasise the last sentence of the quotation. Even within the five months that have elapsed since the Report of the Defence Requirements Com-mittee was submitted there has been a stream of information to strengthen the evidence in that Report that Germany intends to rearm and has begun to do so. A summary of recent information on this subject, in which published and quotable material is distinguished from secret intelligence, is attached in Appendix II.(a) Army Requirements.30. So far as the Army is concerned, apart from such matters as coast defence and air defence, where the Army undertakes responsibilities in aid of the Navy and Air Force respectively, the main proposals of the Defence Requirements Committee turn on the major premise that, in order to protect the vital interests of this country against a possible German aggression, it is essential for us to be in a position to intervene with a military expeditionary force on the Continent of Europe for the defence, in co-operation with other nations, of the Low Countries. The reasons for this assumption are explained in the following passage (CP. 64 (34), paragraph 25) : -&quot; For centuries this has been regarded as vital to our safety, and it is certainly not less true to-day in view of developments in modern armaments. We have fought at regular intervals on the Continent in order to prevent any Power, strong or potentially strong at sea, from obtaining bases on the Dutch and Belgian coasts. To-day the Low Countries are even more important to us in their relation to the air defence of this country. Their integrity is vital to us in order that we may obtain that depth in our defence of London which is so badly needed, and of which our geographical position will otherwise deprive us. If the Low Countries were in the hands of a hostile Power, not only would the frequency and intensity of air attack on London be increased, but the whole of the industrial areas of the Midlands and North of England would be brought within the area of penetration of hostile air attacks.&quot;As our present resources do not permit us to place an adequate army in the field in time to be of value, the Defence Requirements Committee recommend (CP. 64 (34), paragraph 26) :-&apos;&apos; that we should be capable of putting into the field within one month, and there maintaining in all its essentials, a Regular Expeditionary Force of one Cavalry Division, four Infantry Divisions, two Air Defence &quot;Brigades, and one Tank Brigade, together with a full complement of G.H.Q. Corps,and L. of C troops.....We believe that a force organised as above, and supported by appropriate Air Forces, would, as a deterrent to an aggressor, exercise an influence for peace out of all proportion to its size.&quot;31. It will be realised at the outset that the question involved is not whether we should have an Expeditionary Force, but whether, having one, it should be equipped for the purpose of operations on the Continent of Europe. While we never doubted that an efficient Army must be maintained for use in different parts of the world, including the North-West frontier of India, we realised that the proposal set forth in the preceding paragraph required the most careful examination; for public opinion here, though acutely alive to the dangers of air attack, will be very reluctant to undertake any kind of military [10354] . c
commitment on the Continent of Europe. We have therefore subjected this proposal to exhaustive investigation.32. To assist us we addressed a series of questions to the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee designed to elicit in detail why they attach so much importance to the despatch of a military force to the Continent at the outset of a German aggression; whether our object could not be equally well achieved by the use of air forces; the French views on the subject; whether an Expeditionary Force could arrive in time; the nature of the German rearmament; whether the Expeditionary Force would require reinforcement; the effect on the problem of aircraft development in the next few years; the effect of the French and Belgian schemes of fortification; the comparative importance of Belgium and Holland to our own security.33. A fuller summary of the questions, and a synopsis of the replies are given in Appendix III, from which it will be seen that the Chiefs of Staff adhere to their general position as set forth in the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee (paragraph 30 above), and support their views with a wealth of detail.34. After careful consideration of the mass of information briefly summarised in Appendix III, we are forced to the conclusion that the Low Countries, whether considered in terms of sea power or air power, are vital to our security, and, in the opinion of our technical advisers, they can only be defended by the provision of military forces to co-operate with the other countries concerned. Of the two, Belgium is the more liable to attack in any future Franco-German war. Holland, also, cannot be excluded from liability to attack, a liability which will increase as the French and Belgian frontier defences are developed. But the danger in her case is less, as Germany may well hesitate to attack Holland for the same reasons as deterred her in 1914-18 (see paragraph 11 of Appendix III). We agree, however, with the Chiefs of Staff that, in a few years&apos; time, we may be able to consider the problem of Holland on a less conjectural basis, and this part of, and, for that matter, the whole problem, will require to be kept under constant review.35. In deciding whether or not we should have an Expeditionary Force for use in the Low Countries, the question is not whether we should intervene, but whether we should be capable of intervention. We consider that, in the interest of our own defence, we should be capable of this. On merits, therefore, we should aim at a modernisation of the existing Army Expeditionary Force on the lines proposed by the Defence Requirements Committee (see paragraphs 30 and 34 above), so as to make it ready in case of need for prompt action, fully equipped in all respects with material of war on a scale adequate to maintain it in the field until the scheme of industrial mobilisation now in course of preparation by the Principal Supply Officers Committee has developed &quot;sufficiently far to supply its needs. In addition, we must be prepared to reinforce the Expeditionary Force from the Territorial Army, as soon as reinforcements can be made ready.&apos;(b) Air Defence Requirements.36. There is no question to which we have given greater attention than that of Air requirements for Home Defence, which, as indicated in the preceding Section, have exercised a powerful influence on Army requirements. The recommendation of the Defence Requirements Committee provided at home only for the completion of the 52 Squadron scheme originally adopted in 1923. Under their scheme, out of the equivalent of 20 new Squadrons to be formed by 1940 only 10 Squadrons were to be provided for Home Defence. Some weeks ago we foresaw the probability fhat, on merits no less than from the point of view of public opinion in this country, some considerable increase on this recommendation would have to be made. In order not to lose valuable time we decided on the 17th May-&quot; That the Air Ministry should be authorised to consult with the Treasury as to the possibility of initiating certain measures at once which would be common to any scheme of air expansion which might ultimately be sanctioned, on the understanding that, if any measures are agreed, no announcement of any kind should be made.&quot;
37. Two months later it became necessary, as described in Section VIII, for us to anticipate our Final Report by an Interim Report dealing with Air Defence (CP. 193 (34)), which for convenience of reference is attached in Schedule 1. It is, therefore, unnecessary to pursue the matter further here. The decisions of the Cabinet on these recommendations are set forth in Section VIII, paragraph 50.38. Before leaving the question of Air Defence Requirements, however, there are two further matters to which we desire to draw attention :  (1) The extension of the Air Defence scheme to cover the Midlands and Northern England involves as a corollary the extension of the War Office scheme of anti-aircraft guns and searchlights. This is dealt with in Section VIII of this Report.(2) The Defence Requirements Committee in paragraph 30 of its Report made strong recommendations on the subject of Air Raids Precautions, namely, that the Home Office should be asked to draw up an estimate in consultation, if they think fit, with the Air Raids Precautions Sub-Committee; and that the ban against full publicity should be removed in order to enable the necessary preparations in this matter to be completed and rendered effective. The Cabinet has recently decided that a statement on this subject should be made in Parliament, so it is unnecessary for us to make any recommendation.(c) Political Requirements.39. Our investigation of Army and Air Force requirements for Home Defence brought to light the desirability of supporting the plans of the Defence Services by ancillary political action. In this report, and especially in Appendix III, it has been shown (1) that the Low Countries are vital to our security; (2) that they can only be defended by the provision of military forces to co-operate with the other countries concerned; and (3) that in order to render our own air forces effective both for defence and for counter-offensive (which is an essential part of the defensive arrangements), aerodromes in France or Belgium are almost essential.40. There is a risk, however, that in the event of a sudden aggression by Germany a small State like Belgium or Holland, unless assured of prompt aid, might abandon the struggle at the outset and yield to superior force. On the other hand, if the country in question felt sure of early assistance it would have every incentive to hold out pending the arrival of reinforcements.41. France, of course, is better situated than this country to come to the assistance of Belgium or Holland. At present, however, so far as our informa-tion goes, even in the case of Belgium, the French have given no undertaking to do so. The Franco-Belgian Military Agreement of 1920, as M. Hymans explained in the Belgian Chamber on the 4th March, 1931, has no political implications and is merely an arrangement for consultation between the two General Staffs for the purpose of being ready to implement the Locarno obliga-tion. Moreover, at present the French plans are understood to aim principally at preserving French territory and they do not hope to be in a position unaided to ensure the integrity of Belgium, far less of Holland. We think it probable, however, that the French attitude would change if they realised that British aid to Belgium would be forthcoming.42. In these circumstances we gave careful consideration to the question of whether any political action could be taken at the present time to improve the position in this respect. After considering our proposals, the -Cabinet on the 27th June decided in principle (Cabinet 26 (34), Conclusion 4) (i) That the defence of Belgian territory against foreign aggression is a vital British interest which we must, in case of need, actively sustain; and(ii) that this fact should be placed on record at an early and suitable opportunity.
These decisions were put into effect on the 13th July, when the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in the course of a statement in the House of Commons on the proposed Mutual Guarantee Pact for Eastern Europe, made the following declaration :  &quot;Belgium is no less vital to the interests and safety of this country to-day than it has been in times past. It is a geographical fact which nothing can change. Indeed, changed conditions, especially in connection with the air, have not altered that historic fact at all; they have only served to emphasise it. That is the point of view of our own national security. But here again it is the mutual character of the original agreement signed at Locarno, dealing among other things with the frontier between Belgium and Germany, which constitutes its essential feature and makes it so valuable a guarantee of European security as a whole.&quot;43. In order to give practical effect to a policy of coming to the assistance of Belgium under the provisions of the Locarno Treaty, it would be necessary to concert arrangements beforehand with other Powers concerned in Belgian security. The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee in a review of the strategical implications of the declaration on Belgian security, laid emphasis on the importance of French co-operation if the Belgian commitment should mature, partly in order to give us the use of French ports to supplement the small Belgian ports (Ostend and Zeebrugge), which are both in the area of continuous aircraft attack, and partly to ensure the avoidance of a military commitment beyond our strength. France, therefore, as well as Belgium, might have to be included in such conversations. From a purely strategical aspect Holland is almost equally important, but as mentioned in paragraph 34, it may be possible in a few years&quot; time to consider the problem of Holland on a less conjectural basis than at present.44. At present, however, public opinion here is not prepared for further action of this kind, and, whatever the future may bring, now that a public reference to our interest in Belgium has been made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, we see no reason for any further immediate political action in Europe in connection with defence requirements.VII. THE DEFENCE OF INDIA.45. The Defence Requirements Committee (CP. 64 (34), paragraph 31) i. advises, so far as the Defence of India is concerned, that &apos;&apos; if the deficiencies are made good to meet the German menace, the requirements of the Defence of India can be met.&quot; We have no remarks to make on this observation, and we recom-mend the Cabinet to endorse the recommendation in Conclusion (7) of the summary of the Defence Requirements Committee&apos;s Report &quot;that the Government of India should be urged to expedite the work of correcting their worst deficiencies, as a complement to our own efforts. This should include bringing up to date the defences of Indian ports in accordance with plans already drawn up, which is essential to complete our defensive arrangements in the Far East.&quot;VIII.-THE PROGRAMME.46. In the preceding sections of this Report the results of our Inquiry are dealt with from the point of view of merits alone. Generally speaking, subject to our view as to the need for a larger Air Force at home, they confirm the advice tendered by the Defence Requirements Committee. In this section we review these results from the financial and political aspects.47. From a financial point of view we were advised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer &apos;&apos; to put it bluntly, that we are presented with proposals impossible to carry out.&quot; His proposal was to bring down the total additional expenditure on the deficiency programmes in the five-year period from  76-8 million involved in the Defence Requirements Committee&apos;s programme to  50-3 million.    The
Chancellor of the Exchequer protected his position by observing that he is not binding himself or his successors to find the additional sum mentioned either within the five years or in the particular years to which they are allotted. He emphasises that &quot; Any programme now adopted can be adopted only in principle and as a general guide. The sums to be allotted to the respective Departments in any year will, as heretofore, have to be decided each year when estimates are under consideration in the light of financial, political and economic circum-stances at home and abroad, and the programme will have to be revised as circumstances change.&quot;48. As the sum mentioned in the previous paragraph is not sufficient to enable the five-year deficiency programme of the Defence Requirements Committee to be carried out in full, we have had to devise a fresh programme in order to make the best possible provision for Imperial and national defence within the prescribed limits. In carrying out this task we have taken into account international and political as well as the over-ridirig financial considerations.49. On a fresh review of the international outlook we find that, although the situation has -fluctuated considerably during our Inquiry, both in the Far East and in Europe, there is no ground for recommending a basic alteration in the general priorities laid down by the Cabinet for the Defence Requirements Committee last November (see paragraph 6), according to which the expenditures of the Defence Departments are to be governed by the defence of our possessions and interests in the Far East, European commitments and the defence of India. Our Inquiry, however, has thrown into somewhat higher relief the dangers to this country from air attack by Germany and the importance of the Low Countries from this point of view. This suggested the desirability of strengthening our air defence with as little delay as possible in order to safeguard the heart of the Empire. At the same time, the evidence of German intentions to rearm, especially in the air, pointed to the desirability of providing some deterrent to German developments by making it clear that we had no intention of leaving this country so inadequately defended as to invite attack.50. Although currents of more or less uninformed public opinion at home ought never to be a determining factor in defensive preparations, they have to be reckoned with in asking Parliament to approve programmes of expenditure. In the present case it happened that the general trend of public opinion appeared to coincide with our own views as to the desirability of a considerable expansion of the Royal Air Force for home defence. In fact, as already mentioned, the -pressure for some statement of the Governments air defence policy before the Parliamentary recess became so strong that we were obliged to anticipate this Report on Imperial Defence as a whole by an interim Report on Air Defence (CP. 193 (34)) (Schedule I). As our views on the subject are set forth in the interim Report, we will not repeat them here, and, so far as air defence is concerned, it is unnecessary to go further than to quote the substantive parts of the Cabinefs decision of the 18th July, viz. :- &quot; (a) To approve the Interim Report by the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament dealing with Air Defence (CP. 193 (34)), the recommenda-tions of which are summarised in the last paragraph as follows : (1) The provision of 41^ new Squadrons* of the Royal Air Force for the following services : (a) 33 Squadrons for Home Defence, making, with the existing42 Squadrons, a total of 75 Squadrons.(b) 4-1 Squadrons* for the Fleet Air Arm.(c) 3 Squadrons for Singapore.(d) 1 Squadron for the Far East, exclusive of Singapore.* The figure for the total in the Cabinet conclusion was 40i Squadrons, and for the Fleet Air Arm 3i Squadrons; but it afterwards transpired that a Squadron already provided for the Fleet Air Arm in the programme, 1934-35, had been overlooked. The correct figure therefore for the total is 41A Squadrons, and for the Fleet Air Arm 4i Squadrons. In the Lord Presidents -announcement in Parliament on July 19 (Appendix IV) the total figure was given as 41 Squadrons.
(2) The above forces to be provided within five years from 1934, at a total cost estimated at  20,000,000. The suggested annual instalments of the programme and their approximate cost are shown in the Appendix.(3) In order to test the suitability of the Fleet Air Arm to co-operate directly in Home Defence, and of Home Defence units to co-operate with the Fleet Air Arm, in case of necessity, the Admiralty and Air Ministry should concert experiments in training one or two Squadrons from the Fleet Air Arm and the Home Defence Air Force respectively to undertake the dual role, and should report on the result to the Committee of Imperial Defence within a period not exceeding two years. In addition, the two Departments should examine the question of inter-changeability in all its aspects, including that of design of aircraft.(4) The decision as to the final destination of the Squadron recom-mended for the Far East apart from Singapore should be postponed until the Committee of Imperial Defence, advised by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, has been consulted.(5) Our Defence position ought to be kept constantly under review, and the programme recommended should be adjusted from time to time in the light of new factors in the situation. In particular, the Chancellor of the Exchequer does not bind himself or his successors to find the additional sums mentioned in this Report within five years or in the particular years to which they are allotted.(&amp;) That the intention of the Cabinet is to provide the aircraft required for the Cruisers of the 1933-34, 1934-35, 1935-36 programme, as well as for the Carrier, and that the dates at which they are to be furnished should be settled by arrangement between the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air, subject to the agreement of the Chancellor of the&apos; Exchequer.(c) That, in considering the final destination of the Squadron to be sent to the Far East apart from Singapore (Conclusion (a) (4) above), the Committee of Imperial Defence should also examine the possibility and desirability of providing landing-grounds at some or all of the ports concerned (Hong Kong, Penang, Ceylon ports, Aden), with a view to a possible scheme of emergency reinforcement if, when the emergency arises, aircraft can be made available from elsewhere.&quot;(Cabinet 29 (34), Conclusion 3.)51. To the Army the Chancellor agreed provisionally and subject to the caveat mentioned in paragraph 47, to allot a total sum of  20 million to be spread over 1934 and the four subsequent years. This is about half of the sum required to carry out the Defence Requirements Committee^ deficiency programme for the Army. The new programme, which on the advice of the Secretary of State for War we recommend for adoption by the Cabinet, is given in full in Schedule 2. This programme makes provision for the completion of the first stage of the Singapore Defence Scheme by 1938-39; for an expenditure of  924,000 on other ports East of Suez by the year 1938-39, leaving  1,228,000 to complete; and for a relatively small expenditure on Mediterranean and Home Ports.52. For the Air Defence of Great Britain it is proposed to spend  490,000 annually till 1938-39, together with  100,000 a year for anti-aircraft ammunition. At this rate the existing scheme for air defence, so far as.the War Office are concerned, can be completed in 1939-40. The expansion of the existing scheme, to coyer the Midlands and part of Northern England, is not catered for in the War Office schedule, as the whole question is still under review. A figure of an additional  4 millions has been mentioned in this connection. The provision of this eventual sum will require consideration in due course, but it is not possible to make any recommendations on the question until it has been thoroughly examined in all its aspects.
53. For the Regular Expeditionary Force a total of  12,004,000 is provided in the Army programme, subdivided as follows :  Personnel ... ... ... ...      1,892,000Material    ... ... ... ...      5,312,000Ammunition Reserves ... ...      4,800,000This will leave to be provided in later years  9,508,000 for material and  6,060,000 for Ammunition Reserves (total,  15,568,000) in order to complete the requirements of the Regular Expeditionary Force on the scale proposed by the Defence Requirements Committee. For the Territorial Force it has only been found possible to provide  200,000.54. The War Office, in submitting their proposals, have emphasised that they can be regarded merely as a rough forecast, and that it may be necessary to adjust expenditure in any given year between the various items.55. In the case of the Navy, future needs are of two kinds, namely, the making good of accumulated deficiencies and the Naval Construction Programme.56. The Naval deficiencies provided for in the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee would involve an expenditure of just over  21 millions, spread over five years, leaving over  9 millions to be provided in subsequent years. Since the Report was received, however, information as to the steps being taken by the United States of America and Japan to modernise their Fleets has compelled the Admiralty to ask for an additional sum for increasing the elevation of the guns and replacing engines and boilers in four Capital Ships. Together with a smaller item of  0-6 millions, for increased maintenance charges due to making good certain Fleet Air Arm deficiencies, this would raise the D.R.C. total of  21 millions to  26 millions. The First Lord of the Admiralty, however, made a proposal for readjusting the Naval Deficiency Programme so as to bring it clown to the limits of the Defence Requirements Committee&apos;s estimate. This proposal would enable a considerable part of the Naval deficiencies to be put right by the year 1938, including the modernisation of the four Capital Ships, but the state of readiness of the Fleet which the Defence Requirements Committee aimed at in 1938 would be postponed until 1942, and the completion of Singapore as a repair base would also be deferred by two years, namely, until 1940.57. The Admiralty forecast for the new construction programme 1933-38 is as follows : Estimated Expenditure. Excess over 1933.    &apos;1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 19381939 and subsequent yers9,330,604 10,717,950 12,269,398 14,354,050 14,709,100 14,928,700 30,501,0001,387,346 2,938,794 5,023,446 5,378,496 5,598,096Total  estimated programmecost  of106,810,80258. The amounts which the Chancellor of the Exchequer felt able to allot to the Admiralty in the years 1934-5 to 1938-9, subject to the provision in paragraph 50 (5), are compared with the First Lord of the Admiralty&apos;s revised estimate of requirements below : Naval Deficiencies.

59. The estimates of the future Naval Construction Programmes are necessarily very uncertain because so much depends upon the results of the Inter-national Naval Conference fixed for 1935, which will not be brought to a conclusion before the Navy Estimates for next year have to be considered. The First Lord of the Admiralty therefore proposed that our Naval Construction Programme for next year should be put forward and considered in the normal way later in the year, and that subsequent programmes should be left undecided pending the important decisions which will have to be made in the forthcoming International Naval Conference.80. This proposal commended itself to the Ministerial Committee, but we felt that a long-range Naval Deficiency Programme could hardly be considered apart from the New Construction Programme, which bulks so large in the annual Navy Estimates, and in all the circumstances we came to the conclusion that the same principles should be applied to the Naval deficiencies as to the Naval Construction Programme; that is to say, that for next year they should be dealt with in the normal way between the Admiralty and the Treasury (with reference to the Cabinet in case of difference), and that subsequent programmes should be left undecided pending the results of the International Naval Conference.61. Recognising the paramount importance of the Navy as the shield of the whole Empire and of its vital seaborne communications against naval attack, we regret that, in the circumstances described above, we cannot recommend to the Cabinet even a provisional long-range programme. The issues bound-up with the results of the Naval Conference, both as regards policy and naval construction, are so vast that in present circumstances we feel that any long-range programme would be premature and perhaps misleading.62. We cannot close this section of our Report without referring to a some-what grave statement made to us by the - Chancellor of the Exchequer on the financial outlook for the next few years, which confirms the view we had already expressed, that the programmes which we propose must be treated as provisional and tentative. They must be subject to annual review in the light not only of the international situation but also of the financial and political outlook.
IX.-SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. 63.   Our Conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as follows : hong-Range Policy,(i) Subject to the explanations in paragraph 4, our long-range defence policy cannot be founded exclusively on a basis that may prove temporary and shifting and must be susceptible to adaptation to meet changes in the international situation.   (Paragraph 5.)Immediate Policy.(2) Our foreign policy must continue to be directed towards the promotion of a stable peace throughout the world and the reduction and limitation of armaments. But, at the moment, no developments of this nature can be foreseen which would enable us to avoid the re-equipment of our defence forces.   (Paragraphs 8 and 49.)(3) For the present, the expenditure of the Defence Departments should be governed by the defence of our possessions and interests in the Far East; European commitments; and the defence of India. No expenditure need be incurred on measures of defence required exclusively against attack by the United States of America, France or Italy, provided that defences are not allowed to fall so far behind that it will be impossible to bring them up to a suitable standard in time to meet changes in the political situation. (Paragraphs 4 and 6.)Imperial Defence The Far East.(4) In the Far East we should continue our efforts to secure a permanent friendship with Japan. Pending the fruition of this policy, and in any case steps must be taken to remedy the very serious weakness of our defensive position in this region (paragraph 11). This is a matter of the first importance from the point of view of Imperial Defence policy and is essential to the security of the British Empire in the Far East.   (Paragraph 13.)(5) On merits, therefore, so far as financial exigencies allow, we ought to aim at the following : (i) The completion of our worst naval deficiencies;(ii) Proceeding with the approved programme for the completion ofthe Singapore naval base and the first stage of the defences;(iii) Completion of the defence of Hong Kong;(iv) Completion of the defence of other fuelling stations in the far east.   (Paragraph 17.)Measures for securing Peace in Europe.(6) Whatever may be the result of the efforts now in progress to promote security in Europe, His Majesty&apos;s Government should not be deterred from seeking fresh opportunities to promote peace and bring about the reduction or at least the limitation of armaments. In the mean-time, in view of the accumulating evidence that Germany has started to rearm in earnest, it would be unsafe to delay the initiation of steps to provide for the safety of the country.   (Paragraph 26.)Home Defence: Europe.(7) The Low Countries (Belgium and Holland) are vital to our security from the point of view of both naval and air defence, and in the opinion of the Governments technical advisers can only be defended by the provision of military forces to co-operate with other countries concerned. Of the two, Belgium is the more liable to attack in any future Franco-German war. Holland also, however, cannot be excluded from liability to attack, particularly as the French and
Belgian frontier defences are developed, though there are strong reasons which might deter Germany, as in the late war, from violating Dutch territory.   (Paragraph 34, and Appendix III, paragraph 2.)(a) Army Requirements.(8) On merits, we should aim at a reorganisation of the existing Army &quot;Expeditionary Force, on the lines proposed by the Defence Require-ments Committee; that is to say, it should be equipped for war in different parts of the world, including, if necessary, the Continent of Europe. Together with the appropriate Air Forces this would provide an essential element in a plan of co-operation with other nations for the defence of the Low Countries, but we should have to contemplate reinforcement from the Territorial Army as soon as practicable.   (Paragraphs 31 and 35.)(b) A ir Requirements.- (9) On merits, Air Forces considerably in excess of those recommended by the Defence Requirements Committee are required. For details, see Conclusion (14) below, which covers the Fleet Air Arm and oversea requirements, as well as Home Defence.(c) Political Requirements.(10) Arising out of Conclusion (7) above, the requirements of the Defence Services for Home Defence rendered desirable the Declaration made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons on the 13th July on the subject of the vital importance of Belgium to the interests and safety of this country. In order to give practical effect to a policy of giving assistance to Belgium, it would be necessary to concert arrangements beforehand with other Powers concerned. This, however, is not proposed at present. (Para-graphs 39-44.)Defence of India.(11) If the deficiencies to meet our European commitments are made good, the requirements of the Defence of India can be met.(12) The Government of India should be urged to expedite the work of correcting their worst deficiencies as a complement to our own efforts. This should include bringing up to date the defences of Indian ports in accordance with plans already drawn up, which is essential to complete our defensive arrangements in the Far East. (Para-graph 45.)The Programme.(13) Our Defence position ought to be kept constantly under review, and the provisional and tentative programme recommended should be adjusted from time to time in the light of new factors in the situation. In particular, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will not bind himself or his successors to find the additional sums mentioned in this Report within five years or in the particular years to which they are allotted. (Paragraph 50 (a) (5).)The Royal Air Force.(14) Parliamentary considerations necessitated our submitting an Interim Report on Air Defence requirements (Schedule 1).   The decision of the Cabinet, the substance of which was announced in the House of Commons on the 19th July, may be summed up as follows :  Subject to the provisions of Conclusion (13) 41-1* new Squadrons of the Royal Air Force, including  33 Squadrons for Home Defence, 4^* Squadrons for the Fleet Air Arm. 3 Squadrons for Singapore,1 Squadron for the Far East, exclusive of Singapore,the above to be provided in 1934, and the four ensuing years at a total cost estimated at  20,000,000.* See footnote to paragraph 50.
The Admiralty and Air Ministry to concert experiments in-training one or two Squadrons from the Fleet Air Arm and the Home Defence Air Force respectively to undertake a dual role, and to report on the result to the Committee of Imperial Defence within two years; the two Departments also to examine the question of inter-changeability in all its aspects, including that of design of aircraft.The aircraft required for the Cruisers of 1933 to 1936-Programmes to be provided at dates which should be settled by arrangement between the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air, subject to the agreement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The decision as to the destination of the Squadron for the Far East, apart from Singapore, to be postponed until the Committee of Imperial Defence, advised by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, has been consulted.The Committee of Imperial Defence will also examine the possibility and advisability of providing landing grounds at Hong Kong, Penang, Ceylon ports and Aden, with a view to a possible scheme of emergency reinforcements if, when the emergency arises, aircraft can be made available from elsewhere.   (Paragraph 50.)The Army.(15) Subject to the provisions of Conclusion (13) above a sum of  20,000.000 should be allotted to the Army to be spread over 1934 and the four subsequent years in accordance with the programme submitted by the Secretary of State for War (Schedule 2). This programme makes provision for completing the first stage of the Singapore Defence Scheme and for progress being made on the defence of other ports East of Suez by the year 1938-39; for a relatively small expenditure on Mediterranean and Home ports; for the completion of the existing scheme of air defence, so far as the War Office are concerned, by 1939-40, but not for the expansion of the existing scheme to cover the Midlands and Northern England.  12,000,000 is provided for the Regular Expeditionary Force, leaving  15,500,000 to be provided after 1938-39 in order to complete requirements on the scale proposed by the Defence Requirements Committee. For the Territorial Army it has only been found possible to provide a very small sum. (Para-graphs 51-53.)The Navy.(16) While recognising the paramount importance of the Navy as the shield of the whole Empire and of its vital seaborne communications, we find it impossible, in present circumstances, to recommend a long-range naval replacement programme, owing to the uncertainties introduced by the forthcoming International Naval Conference. In the circum-stances we recommend that both the Naval Construction Programme and the Naval Deficiencies Programme for next year should be put forward and considered in the normal way between the Admiralty and the Treasury (with reference to the Cabinet in case of difference), and that subsequent programmes should be left undecided pending the important decisions which will have to be made in the forthcoming International Naval Conference. (Paragraphs 55-62.) Both the Naval Construction Programme and the Naval Deficiencies Programme will be considered by the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the early autumn, and the results will be reported to the Cabinet not later than the end of October.Signed on behalf of the Committee :STANLEY BALDWIN,(A cting Chairman).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, July 31, 1934.
2USCHEDULE 1.SECRET.CP. 193 (34).CABINET.IMPERIAL DEFENCE POLICY.Interim Report by the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament dealing with air Defence.PARLIAMENT has more than once been informed that if our efforts to bring about disarmament did not finally succeed, the Government would see to it that in air strength and air power this country was no longer in a position inferior to any country within striking distance of our shores. Although we have not abandoned all hope of reaching some Air limitation within the next two years, the want of definite progress at Geneva is such that the Government have found it necessary to announce that a statement on the Royal Air Force will be made in the House of Commons before the Summer Recess.2. In these circumstances the Ministerial Committee, which, on the basis of the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee (CP. 64 (34)) has been examining the requirements of the three Defence Services from the point of view of Imperial Defence as a whole, has thought it necessary to anticipate its Final Report (which is nearing completion) by submitting to the Cabinet that portion of its programme which deals with Air Defence.Basis of the Programme.3. As the result of a most exhaustive Inquiry the Ministerial Committee recommend a programme of expansion of our Air Forces drawn up by the Chief of the Air Staff on the following basis : (1) The Force is to be ready for war in five plus three (eight) years;(2) A sum of not more than  20,000,000 to be assumed to be available in thefirst five years for this purpose and to be spread out over these years; (3) The scheme to take into account the needs of Home Defence, the fleet air Arm, Singapore and the Far East,* and also the need for reserves,but paying particular attention to achieving the maximum deterrent effect in distributing the programme.Programme Recommended.4. The actual programme recommended will provide a total of 40^- new Squadrons, as follows : (a) 33 Squadrons for Home Defence;\b) 3^ Squadrons for the Fleet Air Arm;(c) 3 Squadrons for Singapore;(d) 1 Squadron for the Far East, exclusive of Singapore.* The original basis was &quot; Singapore only in the Far East,&quot; but was subsequently modified. .See paragraph 16. .....
5. The provision of these units will leave  1,200.000 within the total of  20,000,000, plus any savings which may accrue in the course of the five-year programme, for beginning the building up of a war reserve. This is a matter to which we return later in paragraphs 9 to 11.6. There are several points of importance in connection with this programme which should be within the knowledge of the Cabinet in taking their decision.Home Defence Sqtiadrons.7. The strength of the additional air force which we recommend for Home Defence, as already mentioned, is 33 Squadrons, making an aggregate of 75 Squadrons for Home Defence. This compares with 10 new Squadrons recom-mended by the Defence Requirements Committee, which would make only 52 Squadrons for Home Defence in all. It is only fair to mention, however, that the Defence Requirements Committee had anxiously considered an addition of a further 25 Squadrons (most of which were intended for Home Defence) and had invited the Cabinet to give this matter very careful consideration before arriving at a decision (CP. 64 (34), paragraphs 28 and 29).8. In deciding to aim at an Air Force for Home Defence of 75 instead of 52 Squadrons we have taken into account both recent changes in the international situation and the trend of public opinion in this country. Since the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee was received on the 28th February, and up to the visit of M. Barthou to London on the 9th and 10th July, there has been an almost continuous deterioration in the European situation, and a good deal more evidence has become available as to the extent of the German plans for rearmament -ment in the air. In these circumstances it is no longer safe to delay the completion of our plans for Air Defence, and, in particular, a start ought to be made with the extension of the Air Defence Scheme to cover the wider area of the country within range of air attack from Germany.* At the same time, public opinion in this country is manifesting a good deal of concern as to our defensive arrangements generally, and there is a widespread desire for an increase in the Royal Air Force. In these circumstances we have come to the conclusion that the proposals of the Defence Requirements Committee are no longer adequate to the needs of the situation, and that public opinion would not be satisfied with the relatively modest increase they proposed, which would only have completed the original 52-Squadron programme announced ten years ago.9. The maximum sum which the Chancellor of the Exchequer finds it possible to contemplate for Imperial Defence requirements does not enable provision to be made for the expansion we recommend and at the same time to equip the air forces at home on the scale proposed by the Defence Requirements Committee; which was designed to enable them to operate continuously in the event of war in Europe within five years.10. We have devoted considerable attention to the question of the proper division of our available resources between the provision of new Squadrons and of reserve machines and armaments respectively.Considered from the point of view of the deterrent effect on Germany as a potential aggressor and from that of public opinion in this country, there is much to be said for the formation of as large a number of new Squadrons as possible. Apart from this, there are strong objections to piling up reserves of aircraft too soon. Development in aircraft design and construction is rapid in these days, and if types of machines require to be changed it would be very wasteful to have to scrap not only the first-line machines and their working reserves but also a large number of war reserve machines which perhaps would never even have been flown.On the other hand, there are obvious risks in the plan of &quot; putting all our wares in the shop window &quot; if pressed too far. For example, factory production of aircraft in this country is an ascertainable fact, and it may be assumed that in due course the intelligence departments of foreign nations Would deduce that the output of machines was insufficient to provide the reserves required for maih-* Note. The extension of the Air Defence Scheme of Great Britain will involve the provision of additional anti-aircraft guiis and lights, the coat of which will be considerable and will fall oh War Office -Votes. The details of this expenditure, therefore, form part of the military defence requirements, which are still under consideration.
taining and operating Squadrons in time of war. When this was realised, the value of the deterrent would be reduced. The reserve must be provided before an outbreak of war becomes imminent. There is also, of course, the obvious risk that war might break out suddenly and that the Royal Air Force, unprovided with reserves, would not be able to sustain operations on any considerable scale for more than a limited period.11. On balance, we have come to the conclusion that in present circumstances we should, in the main, concentrate on an expansion of the Home Defence Force in the early years. During this first stage we should make some provision for war requirements, the bulk of which, however, will have to be deferred to a later stage unless some change in the situation necessitates a speeding up. It is true that this will not give us an Air Force capable of sustained warfare within the five-year period contemplated by the Defence Requirements Committee. It will, however, provide the framework of such a Force, with those permanent elements such as personnel, aerodromes, buildings, workshops, and so forth, which take so long to provide in normal times. If necessity arises it will be possible to accelerate the provision of all the essential accessories. Above all, the mere announcement of a substantial increase would act as a deterrent to Germany and inspire confidence at home.   To this we attach the utmost importance.Fleet Air Arm.12. In the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee it was explained that &quot; The present Fleet Air Arm is short of the total capacity of the Fleet by 51 aircraft, of which 29 are a deficiency in Carrier-borne aircraft.&quot; Provision was accordingly made in that Report for 4 Aeroplane Squadrons under the Deficiency Programme. Provision for further Squadrons was also foreshadowed under the Naval Construction Programme. One Squadron of 12 aircraft is being provided for the Fleet Air Arm in the present year, and we have recom-mended an addition of 3-  Squadrons in order to complete the total to 51 by the end of 1933. The formation of the additional 3  Squadrons includes no provision for any additional requirements for the Fleet Air Arm which will mature when the new Aircraft-Carrier, which is due for completion in 1938, is put into commission. To provide that complement (estimated at 72 aircraft) it would be necessary to form in 1939 at least three further Squadrons (36 first-line aircraft). This number, we understand, should be sufficient to provide the equipment for the new Carrier, taking into account existing Fleet Air Arm units which would be available for embarkation in the new Carrier by reason of one or other Aircraft Carriers being out of commission for refitting. Admittedly this arrangement is less satisfactory than would be the provision of the full establishment for the Carrier in 1938, but the financial situation is one in which all the needs of the Defence Services cannot be met within a five-year programme. As we are only dealing with a five-year programme, no provision is made for additional Fleet Air Arm requirements which will mature after 1938. There may, in addition, be a small requirement for the Cruiser programme 1934-35-36; but any provision for this service which would fall on Air votes can be found from the total allotment of  20,000,000 to the Air Ministry.13. In connection with the provision to be made for the Fleet Air Arm, we have given careful consideration to a proposal for an interchangeability of air units between the Fleet Air Arm and Home Defence Squadrons, with the object of forming a reserve for either service. We need not trouble the Cabinet with the technical details of this question, which are rather complicated. We remitted the question for investigation to a special Sub-Committee, which reported that at present it is inadvisable to assume immediate interchangeability between units of the Fleet and Home Defence respectively.14. In order, however, to test the suitability of the Fleet Air Arm to co-operate directly in home defence, and of Home Defence units to co-operate with the Fleet Air Arm in case of necessity, we recommend that the Admiralty and Air Ministry should concert experiments in training one or two Squadrons from the Fleet Air Arm and the Home Defence Air Force respectively to under-take the dual role and should report on the result to the Committee of Imperial Defence within a period not exceeding two years. In addition, the two Departments should examine the question of interchangeability in all its aspects, including that of design of aircraft.
The Far East.15. The three Squadrons provided in our programme for Singapore are the same as recommended by the Defence Requirements Committee.16. Apart from Singapore, the Defence Requirements Committee recommended the provision of 7 Squadrons for the Far East (4 Squadrons for Hong-Kong and 1 apiece for Penang, Ceylon and Aden). It is with some reluctance that we find it impossible to include these Squadrons within our recommendations for the five-year period. The sum available for Imperial Defence, however, does not enable us to provide all these Squadrons at the same time as the forces we deem necessary for the other requirements described above, to which we attach even greater importance. Although our original instruction to the Chief of the Air Staff was to take into account the needs of Singapore only in the Far East, he asked us to include provision for one additional Squadron at Hong-Kong. Our recommendation takes the form than an additional Squadron should be allotted to the Far East, but this is subject to a recommendation that the Cabinet should postpone a decision as to its final destination until the Committee of Imperial Defence, advised by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, has been consulted.17. In putting forward the above recommendations there is one over-riding consideration to which we attach the greatest importance. The programme is put forward in the light of the international and financial situations as we see them to-day, taking also due account of the political situation and tendencies in this country. All these factors, however, are very fluid, and we think that our Defence position ought to be kept constantly under review. Our recommenda-tions are made on the assumption that this will be done, and that if it should be found at any time that there is any intensification of the danger from one quarter or another, whether in the East or in the West, or any other pronounced change in the situation, then the programme may have to be expedited or adjusted to the new circumstances. We add that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has felt bound to protect his position by observing that he is not binding himself or his successors to find the additional sums mentioned either within the five years or in the particular years to which they are allotted.18. We attach as an Annex a Table showing the incidence of the proposed expenditure within the five-year period, but we strongly recommend that in any public announcement no reference should be made to the stages of the programme.Summary.19.   Our recommendations may be summarised as follows : (I) The provision of 40^ new Squadrons of the Royal Air Force for the following services : (a) 33 Squadrons for Home Defence, making, with the existing42 Squadrons, a total of 75 Squadrons.*(b) 3^ Squadrons for the Fleet Air Arm.(c) 3 Squadrons for Singapore.(d) 1 Squadron for the Far East, exclusive of Singapore.(2) The above forces to be provided within five years from 1934, at a total cost estimated at  20,000,000.t The suggested annual instalments of the programme and their approximate cost are shown in the Appendix.* There may, in addition, be a small requirement for the Cruiser programme 1934-35-36 ; any provision for this service falling on Air votes can be found from the total sum allotted in Recommendation (2).f The figure of  20,000,000 is exclusive of expenditure falling on Navy votes through the Fleet Air Arm grant-in aid.

The above table must be regarded at the present stage more as an aim than a practical programme. The ability of manufacturers to deliver the material (especially in lino A(b)) in the quantities proposed in each successive year is a matter for detailed investigation.

APPENDIX II.Summary of Evidence in regard to the Progress of German Rearmament since the Completion of the Defence Requirements Committee&apos;s Report (i.e., approximately from January 1, 1934. to the present time).Part I.Evidence of a Non-Secret Character which can, if Necessary, be Used inPublic1. THE following is very briefly a summary of published evidence in regard to the progress of German rearmament since the beginning of this year.Navy.2. There is nothing of sufficient importance to record in regard to naval preparations. Although there have been infringements of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, they have been more in the spirit than in the letter and in respect of the smaller classes of vessels.A rmy.3. This year&apos;s Reichsheer&apos;s budget made provision for the addition of 172,000,000 reichsmarks, which was defended by the German Government as being necessary in view of the preparations provided for in the fiscal year 1934-35, with regard to the transformation of the Reichsheer into a short-service army.Air Force.4. Since the advent of the Nazi regime, aviation in Germany has been given an impetus the reason for which it is difficult to reconcile with any normal requirements of her commercial or sporting aviation.Air Budget.5. Germany&apos;s Air Budget in 1932-33 amounted to 43.343.200 reichsmarks, and on that budget she operated commercial air lines probably second to none in Europe. Her budget in 1933-34 disclosed a year late had risen to 78,348,450 reichsmarks, and this year, 1934-35, to the surprising figure of 210,187,650 reichsmarks.6. The efficiency of her commercial aviation system was well known, and it was not surprising therefore that the disclosure of this 1934-35 budget was the subject of considerable comment in the foreign press; so much so that the German Government voluntarily issued a statement that this sum was required solely for the improvement and re-equipment of her commercial air lines and for the extension of her passive air defence system. Such a statement is, however, uncon-vincing, even though it is admitted that in Germany&apos;s commercial aviation there are types which could never prove to be a paying proposition.Sporting and Amateur Aviation.7. In sporting and amateur aviation which is now centralised in one large Air Sports Society and which, according to the Paris Air Agreement may not be subsidised, we find the personnel wearing air uniforms, aircraft flying in formation, and in fact a movement having every appearance of being organised on military lines. This air sports society, which now has a membership of something like 100,000, has been accorded the same legal status as the S.S-and S.A., which means that they are available for the defence of the Government.Construction of Aerodromes and General Preparations.8. The building of many additional aerodromes, which, through their geographical position, can be of no value to commercial aviation; the secrecy being observed in everything connected with her aircraft industj y; the (what[10354] f
can only be described as) feverish preparations for air defence; the endless propaganda stressing her need of air forces; the importance attached to the promotion of air-mindedness in the youth movement; all these are facts which can only lead one to the conclusion that Germany intends to have air equality. Further, if one is to place any reliance upon the reports now almost a daily feature of the press, Germany has already taken steps towards achieving this aim.Extracts from Recent Telegrams and Published Information.(Important: Telegrams starred must not be quoted without reference to theForeign Office.)9.

Part II.Evidence of a Secret or Very Secret Nature which must in no Circumstances be made Public17. The following is evidence of a secret or very secret nature from the period approximately the 1st January, 1934, to the present time, showing the progress in German rearmament: Navy.18.   There is no information in regard to the Navy which is of sufficient importance to record.A rmy.(This evidence covers the period since November, 1933.)19. Since the summary of &quot; German Preparations for Military rearmament -ment &quot; printed as Appendix I to Paper No. D.R.C. 5 was compiled in November, 1933, German preparations for rearmament have been intensively pursued. Preparations for the mobilisation of twenty-one Divisions in case of emergency, including the training of selected personnel of the S.A. Militia, mentioned in paragraph 2 of that Appendix, have been continued in anticipation of the expansion of the Reichsheer to the short-service peace establishment of 300,000 average daily effectives which Herr Hitler demanded in the course of the Disarmament discussions subsequent to Germany&apos;s withdrawal from the Conference in October 1933. The preparations for such an expansion appear now to be well advanced.Provision of Cadres and. Personnel.20. General von Blomberg, the Defence Minister, and his assistants are reported by the British Military Attache in Berlin to be determined that expansion shall be soundly based on a cadre of officers of the old type, and that the personnel of the expanded Reichsheer shall be selected in such a manner as to prevent that body becoming a political weapon. The controversy on this point between the Reichswehrministerium and the head of the S.A., in which the former secured the support of the Chancellor, appears indeed to have been a major factor in the fall of Captain Roehm and of his supporters. The Reichswehrministerium is now free to pursue its preparations in its own way.(a) Provision of Officers.21. The expanded Army requires, according to a statement of General von Reichenau, the Under-Secretary of State in the Reichswehrministerium. an additional 14,000 officers. Secret reports show that steps are being taken to obtain these from various sources, viz. : (i) The requirements of senior officers will, in the opinion of the military attache^ Berlin, be met by the return from the reserve of officers retired during recent years, and by promotions within the Reichsheer.(ii) Volunteers have been called for from among officers who retiredimmediately after the war, and it is stated that a first batch of 1,500 have been selected and are being put through refresher courses with a view to their recommissioning as company and battery commanders and their equivalent. It is significant that the reports state that only a small proportion of officers commissioned during the war will be accepted, and those mainly in technical units, since they lack the traditions of the pre-war army.(iii) The very large numbers of junior officers required will, the military attache, Berlin, understands, be obtained : 75 per cent, by increasing the intake of officers through the usual channels;15 per cent, by the promotion of selected n.c.os. of the Reichsheer; 10 per cent, from selected junior leaders from the S.S. and S.A.
22. Secret reports and observations by the Military Attache. Berlin, show that the numbers of officer-aspirants in units have greatly increased, and that the courses of instruction at the Infantry School at Dresden, through which all officers have to pass, have been both enlarged and accelerated. There have been numerous reports of the training, in special short courses under the Reichsheer, of junior leaders of the S.S. and S.A.23. There is, however, zio evidence as yet of the actual incorporation in units of large numbers of additional officers.(b) Provision of Personnel.24. Secret reports confirm that all enlistments into the Reichsheer are now for a period of 18 months instead of the 12 years required by the Treaty of Versailles, and numerous reports indicate the presence with units of large numbers of personnel extra to their establishments, but the extent to which this personnel has actually been enlisted, and is not merely S.A. personnel undergoing courses of training, is difficult to establish. The Military Attache, Berlin, believes that the Reichsheer is now perhaps 50 per cent, over strength, and that the additional personnel represents the cadres in preparation for the expansion of the Reichsheer and the formation of new units. On the other hand, recent reports indicate that the second 100,000 of the 200,000 who are required, and who have been under training in special courses under the Reichsheer, have only now been selected. No evidence is available of their having been incorporated in units.25. The picture is, therefore, one of preparation for expansion rather than of expansion&apos; itself.Provision of Material.26. The withdrawal of Germany from the Disarmament Conference, and her claims for an expansion on a large scale were followed by reports of a notable activity in the extension of munition factories. Definitive reports of an expanded output from such factories are, however, difficult to obtain, and are lacking or fragmentary.The position appears to be (i) Rifles. There has been considerable expansion in output capacity, and it would be dangerous to assume that output will not meet all requix-ements.(ii) Light automatics and Machine Guns. The same is true for light automatics, but. the fact that few actual machine guns have been seen in the hands of the S.A. confirms a doubt whether the full number of machine guns required can yet be available.(iii) Anti-Tank   Weapons. Reports   show   a   remarkable   output   ofcomponents of small calibre weapons of the anti-tank type, and it is probable that sufficient are available, or will shortly be available, for requirements of the expanded Reichsheer.(iv) Infantry Close-Szipport Howitzers (75-mm.). Secret reports showthat these weapons have been manufactured under the disguise of trench mortars, and it is probable that the requirements of the Reichsheer can be met.(v) Field A artillery. Reports of the actual extent of the output of 77-mm. guns and 105-mm. howitzers are lacking, but from the manufac-turing capacity available it must be assumed that the requirements of the 21 Divisions of the expanded army could probably now be met.(vi) Anti-Aircraft Artillery. Reports show particular activity in theproduction of A.A. weapons.(vii) Medium Artillery. It is remarkable that there are still no reports ofthe output in quantity of the essential 150 mm. howitzers, though reports have been received of trials of a new type.
(viii) Heavy and Super-Heavy Artillery. Capacity for the manufacture of heavy guns and howitzers is reported, but there have been few indications of manufacture of such types.(ix) Artillery Ammunition. Although secret reports indicated that the funds placed at the disposal of the Reichsheer would be largely employed in making up the deficient reserves of artillery ammu-nition, and although such reports show a wide extension of shell manufacturing capacity, no reports have been received from which a conclusion can be drawn as to the actual output. This must, however, have been considerable.(x) Tanks. Secret reports indicate that since January 1934 Krupp&apos;s and other firms have been constructing components for light tanks, which are being stored ready for assembly. The numbers available cannot be ascertained, but it must be concluded that at least 250 are now in stock. In addition, a type of armoured tractor suitable for conversion to an Infantry Close-Support Tank is reported to have been standardised, and a number of firms are said to be making and storing the components.Further Evidence of Expansion.27. The actual expansion of the 3 Cavalry and 7 Infantry Divisions of the Reichsheer into an army of 300,000 effectives, with an establishment of 21 Infantry Divisions, will involve the creation of a large number of new Head-quarters ; the rearrangement of areas and commands; the raising of large numbers of new types of units forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles; reoccupation of former barracks; and a large number of promotions, postings, &amp;c, and though it is difficult to believe that these developments could take place unobserved, no definite reports of such developments have so far been received.28. The Military Attache, Berlin, after discussing the question with his colleagues, has reached the conclusion that (a) Each Division will form a Corps Headquarters, commanding the three divisions into which each of the existing divisions will expand;(&amp;) That &quot; shadow &quot; headquarters are now being prepared within existing headquarters;(c) That there are indications of the formation of a 3rd Command (Gruppen-kommando) Headquarters to be located at Munich.29. Military Attache, Berlin, further reports that one of his colleagues considers that 5 new Division Headquarters have already been formed. No confirmation of this has been received, and the report appears to be premature.30. Military Attache, Berlin, states that General von Reichenau is credited, according to rumour, with early transfer to command a Mechanized Force, with headquarters at Weimar.Conclusions as Regards Expansion.   .31. All evidence points to the conclusion that the Reichswehrministerium is making every preparation for the expansion of the Reichsheer at no distant date, but that the&quot; German military authorities are determined not to be hurried and are anxious to build a new army on firm foundations in the old tradition. They have accordingly successfully resisted the pressure of the SA. leaders to swamp the Reichsheer with personnel of the political forces, and it now seems clear.that many of the military activities of the S.A., including the recently reported organisation of S.A. brigades of all arms, were contrary to the intentions of the Reichswehrministerium and will now be discontinued.Readiness for Mobilization.32. The preparations for expansion mentioned above, together with the widespread training, medical examination and classification of the youth of Germany which is reported to have been in progress during the last year, must
3 or 4 Cavalry Divisions 21 Infantry Divisionshave considerably improved the machinery for mobilization. The difficulties which the Reichsheer have encountered in obtaining suitable personnel for expansion may, on the other hand, indicate that the provision of fully trained personnel for mobilization has been by no means solved.33. It seems probable, however, that Germany could mobilise at the present date : with a normal scale of field artillery, but deficient or weak in medium howitzers. Sufficient light tanks and improvised Infantry Support tanks would be available to arm a considerable number of tank battalions to be raised on mobilization.A large frontier defence force, with a sufficient scale of machine-guns, but weak in artillery.34. Mobilization reserves for the above forces might now be sufficient, but it is improbable that a further expansion could be effected until some months after mobilization.Air Force.35. According to information available the development of the German Air Force is proceeding along the following lines : The German Air Ministry.36. The Air Ministry is now constituted as follows : The Minister for Air, Secretary of State for Air, a Central Department, and two staff organisations, one controlling Civil Aviation, Passive Air Defence and the Air Sports Associa-tion, and the other, the &quot; Luftkommando &quot; (Flying Command) administering the German Air Force.Independent Commands.37. The following commands are to come directly under the Air Ministry : -(i) The 1st Air Division of the Luftflott (Air Fleet).The Headquarters of this formation was established at Berlin on the 1st AP^b 1934.The first units are to be ready by July 1934 and by 1st October, 1935, the strength is to be as follows : 3 (B) Group Headquarters. 7 (B) Wing Headquarters. 21 (B) Squadrons. 2 Auxiliary (B) Wing Headquarters. 6 Auxiliary (B) Squadrons. 2 (F) Wing Headquarters. 6 (F) Squadrons.1 (Low Flying) Wing Headquarters. 3 (Low Flying) Squadrons. 5 (Reconnaissance) Squadrons.(ii) Army Co-operation Command.This formation will control all Army Co-operation Units, and by the 1st October, 1935, will have a strength of : 3 (A.C.) Wings. 7 (A.C.) Squadrons.(iii) Area Commands (Luftkreise).Germany is divided into 5 Air Force District Commands which will in each case be responsible for the active air defence, aerodromes, maintenance and auxiliary services situated within its area.In addition, the following units will come under Area Commands :  1 Air Ordnance Depot. 9 Aircraft Parks.
(iv) Schools Command.All flying, armament and technical training establishments, earmarked for service use, were brought under this command on the 1st December, 1933. By the 1st October, 1935, the Schools Command is to reach a strength of 4 Observer Schools. 5 Bombing Schools. 3 Machine-Gun Schools. 6 or 9 Flying Schools. 2 Fighter Schools. 1 Technical School.(v) Naval Command.No details available.Estimated Total Strength of the German Air Force by October 1, 1935. (Calculated on the assumption that there will be 12 aircraft per Squadron.)First Line Aircraft 252 (B) Aeroplanes. 72 (F) Aeroplanes. 36 Low Flying (F) Aeroplanes. 60 Reconnaissance Aircraft. 84 (Army Co-operation) Aircraft.504 Total. 72 Auxiliary (B) Aeroplanes.Reserve A aircraft 100  per  cent,   of  First  Line  Aircraft   (excluding  Auxiliary Aeroplanes).Training Aircraft 400 Training Aircraft.Personnel 2,780 Flying Personnel, Pilots, Observers. 5,630 Aircraft Personnel. 8,450 General Personnel.16,860 Total.Expansion of the German Air Force subsequent to October 1935.38. There are indications that the ultimate intention is to form three or even four air divisions. Evidence in support of this assumption is based on conclusions arrived at as a result of a staff exercise carried out in Germany, which envisaged the employment of three air divisions with the probable addition of a fourth, to be added after the declaration of war.39. Further assumptions leading to this conclusion are that the air division in process of formation is numbered the First Air Division, thereby disclosing an apparent intention to create others; and, in addition, to the fact that German plans appear to deal in multiples of three.Aircraft Indtistry.40. Since the issue of C.I.D. Paper No. 1134-B in March 1934, information received has all tended to confirm the picture therein painted of the German aircraft industry.41. The following are six principal points upon which later information has been received and which appear to be in order : 
Accumulation of Reserves.42. Both aircraft and engines manufactured to the order of the German Government are now being stored and placed to reserve. There is no informa-tion as to the total reserve to be accumulated, but it is important to note that production is now such that the creation of a reserve is possible.Increased Output.43. In C.I.D. Paper No. 1134-B it is stated that the rate of output in February 1934 of the whole German aircraft industry was about sixty to seventy-air frames per month. It is now known that in May 1934 the monthly rate of output of Junker&apos;s factory alone was forty-five aircraft per month. Therefore, the present average monthly output of the whole German aircraft industry may well have been increased by 50 per cent, or more since January last.44. A number of other firms have started to manufacture accessories and components for aircraft and engines. This, in itself, naturally tends to increase the total output.45. There is insufficient evidence, at present, to warrant any increase in the estimate of the potential capacity, as opposed to the actual output, of the German aircraft industry as given in C.I.D. Paper No. 1134-B, viz., if allowed six months&apos; uninterrupted expansion under mobilization conditions, might exceed 1,000 air frames and 750 aero engines per month, equivalent, on the basis of wastage in 1918, to the maintenance in war of some 800 first-line aircraft.ProdtLCtion of Civil Aircraft suitable for Conversion to Bombers.46. A large number of three-engine machines, known as J.U. 52, are on order for the German Government. These machines, while suitable for heavy commercial traffic, are so designed as to be convertible at short notice into day and night bombers. Added to the above, there are three other types which can be placed in the same category, the Dornier F, the Heinkel 70 and the Junkers 60. all of which are in use.47. One hundred J.U. 52&apos;s were on order through Junkers in April. Fifty machines should have been delivered by now. Reports indicate that further orders have been placed for an additional 300 of these machines, bringing up the total to 400 in all.Increase of Civil Aircraft and Organisation for Military Pin-poses.48. As completed, these three-engine aircraft are being taken into use in the civil air lines. Though it could not be said at the end of 1933 that the number of heavy machines possessed by the civil aircraft lines was greater than that warranted by traffic conditions, there is no justification for the addition of 400 such aeroplanes.49. It is further reported that the necessary armaments and alternative components to transform these J.U. 52 aircraft into bombers are being-manufactured pari passu with the aircraft themselves, and are being stored.50. All aircraft belonging to civil air lines have been detailed to form auxiliary bombing squadrons for war purposes.Probable Strength.51. It is known, from very secret sources, that Germany proposes to have constructed by the end of 1935 an air force of 900 machines. All indications at present point to this intention being carried out, and there is no doubt that the Germans should be able to put into the air 1,000 military machines, or more, in a little over a year.Bombs and Ammunition.52. Reports have also been received showing that the manufacture of aircraft bombs on a considerable scale, evidently for war reserves, has been undertaken.
APPENDIX III.The Position of the Low Countries.Summary of Information obtained from the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.1. WITH a view to eliciting from the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee why they attached so much importance to the maintenance of the integrity of the Low Countries and, also, as to the means by which they considered we could assist in maintaining this integrity, we addressed a series of questions to them, which may be summarised as follows :- (a) Why is so much importance attached to the despatch of a land force tothe Continent at the outset of a war ? (&amp;) Whether assistance to France and Belgium could not be limited to naval and air forces, particularly in view of the fact that the French were understood to expect assistance in these latter forms from us ?(c) Whether an Expeditionary Force could arrive in time to prevent theGermans from reaching the sea 1(d) Whether, assuming superior air forces, we could not prevent an enemyfrom establishing and maintaining aerodromes in the Low Countries from which to attack England ?(e) Whether German rearmament is entirely or chiefly in the air, or whether their air forces are to be strongly supported by mobile land forces ? (/) Whether the size of the proposed Expeditionary Force would be adequate, or would be only a temporary holding force until the nation is able to fight at full strength \(g) What will be the effect on the problem of development in the speed and range of aircraft within the next ten years %(h) The effect on the problem of the French and. Belgian schemes offortification ?(i) The relative importance to us of the maintenance of the integrity of holland in comparison with Belgium, and whether we are likely to be called on to intervene in Holland, and our power to do so?2. In their replies, which were unanimous, the Chiefs of Staff adhered to their general position as set forth in the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee. In their view the Low Countries are, if anything, even more important to the defence of this country than in the past. They are as vital as ever to our sea-power, as proved by the experience of the Great War, when German destroyers and submarines were a continual menace to our sea communi-cations both up and down and across the English Channel. In addition, if the Germans were to succeed in over-running the Low Countries and in establishing air bases near the Belgian or Dutch coasts, not only London, but the whole of the industrial centres of the Midlands and the North, as well as our shipping approaching the coasts, would be within effective and even decisive range of air attacks, which, owing to the short range, could be heavy, continuous and sustained.  A German occupation of the Low Countries &quot; would halve the distance their aircraft would have to travel in order to attack London. That might mean that the frequency of attacks would be increased by fully 50 per cent., and each attack could caity a heavier load of bombs of some 30 per cent. These advantages, expressed in another way, would together be approximately equivalent to an increase of 80 per cent, in the weight of the initial attack which the Germans would be capable of delivering on London.&quot;(D.C. (M) (32) 111.)If, on the other hand, the integrity of the Low Countries were maintained, the Germans would be forced to initiate attacks by air at a distance of 300 to 350 miles from London alone.   To quote the Chiefs of Staff : &quot; Our strategical objects in assisting the Belgian defence, so as to avoid the temporary or permanent occupation of Belgium by Germany, would be as follows  (a) To gain depth for our defence measures for the air defence of this country;[10354] G
(&amp;) To prevent the Germans establishing air bases in Belgium, more particularly in the western portion of that country, in close proximity to our vulnerable areas;(c) To obtain bases in Belgium from which an air counter-offensive canbe carried out at effective range against vulnerable objectives in Germany;(d) To prevent Germany obtaining the use of Belgian ports for navalpurposes, particularly as bases for light forces and submarines.It is obvious that to attain any or all of these objects our military forces must be ready to co-operate at the earliest possible moment in preventing German occupation of Belgian territory.&quot;3. Our Expeditionary Force would not necessarily be employed, as in 1914, in close conjunction with our Allies, but when and where, in conjunction with our naval forces, it can most effectively influence the situation. It must be ready to act rapidly, and it cannot be created at a moments notice.4. The Chiefs of Staff do not admit that naval and air assistance to France and Belgium would suffice without the addition of an Expeditionary Force. Assistance on the sea and in the air will always appear to Continental peoples threatened by land invasion to be but indirect assistance. Refusal on our part to provide direct assistance would be interpreted by our ex-Allies as equivalent to abandoning them to their fate. The arrival of even the small forces proposed would, in the opinion of the Chiefs of Staff, have an incalculable moral effect out of all proportion to their size. The use of aviation as the primary weapon in war has not yet been tested in Europe; consequently, military Powers consider an army is essential to a decision. Continental nations will also realise that the assistance in the air that we can render will depend on the extent to which London is threatened. The Chiefs of Staff cannot advise as to French opinion on this question without opening convei*sations with the French General Staff. They point out, however, that the Low Countries are vital to us, but not to the same extent to France. On the question of the possibility of the Expeditionary Force arriving in time, they consider that if the Belgians and French are encouraged by the knowledge that we are coming to their support they should be able to hold the Germans sufficiently long for reinforcements to reach them, provided that the despatch of those reinforcements was prompt.5. The Chiefs of Staff give no support to the theory that aircraft could be counted on to prevent attacks on England from enemy aerodromes established in the Low Countries. In the course of a detailed exposition of the methods of warfare in the air under modern conditions (D.C. (M) (32) 111), the Chief of the Air Staff points out that &apos;&apos; The nearer the German air bases are brought to territory occupied by our air forces, the more effectively could we attack those aerodromes. The advantage, however, remains with the Germans, since, although their air bases may be more open to attack, London will be similarly more exposed to attack by them, and the latter is, of course, infinitely the more vulnerable target.&quot;The Memorandum proceeds to emphasise that the best defence against air attacks is by attacks against enemy&apos;s factories, sources of supply, means of distribution and military forces, and by the operations of fighting aircraft, anti-aircraft guns and searchlights. Our attacks might force them to withdraw their aerodromes to a safer distance, which would permit them to organise a. more efficient air defence.&quot; The further they are withdrawn from the coast the further would our aircraft have to fight their way through an organised air defence in orderto reach their objectives.....   Even if they judged it desirable to with-draw their bases altogether from the Low Countries, we could not wholly deny to the Germans their use for the location of numbers of advanced landing and refuelling grounds, at which their aircraft would call for refuelling and rearming between raids. It would be impossible altogether to deprive them, by air action alone, of this advantage, which would be of con-siderable value in the conduct of operations against London.&quot;
The importance of the operations of our own aircraft against the German centres of production is commented on as follows : &quot;The occupation of the Low Countries by the Germans would provide for them the most effective means of defending their own vulnerable centres, particularly the Ruhr, from our counter-air attack. The effective tactical range of aircraft is governed mainly by the distance they have to penetrate over hostile defended territory. In their attack on London from the nearest point of Belgium the Germans would only have to fly a distance of about 120 miles, including only some 40 or 50 miles over our defended territory. On the other hand, in order to reach the Ruhr from the nearest point on the English coast, our aircraft would have to fly a distance of 240 miles, of which a minimum of 120 would be over hostile territory.&quot;The Chief of the Air Staffs Memorandum (which is concurred in by his colleagues) concludes with the following statement: &quot;It is therefore not too much to say that the occupation and successful defence of the Low Countries against German invasion would be the most effective means of mitigating the severity of German air attack on London.&quot;6. On the question of the character of the German rearmament the Chiefs of Staff state that up to date it has aimed at the expansion of the seven Infantry Divisions of the Reichswehr to 21 Infantry Divisions on mobilisation; the creation of a defensive covering force, mainly on the frontiers of Poland, consisting of organisations of S.A. and other semi-regular forces; the expansion of the arma-ment industry and war industrial mobilisation of civil industry to produce the maximum output of munitions at the earliest possible date after the outbreak of war; the production of types of tanks, aircraft, &amp;c, and the training of pilots. The creation of a military air force has lately been pressed forward with vigour, but up to recently land forces have taken precedence. The opinion of the Reichswehr Minister is understood to be that the air forces should be used in close co-operation with land forces, and that bombing outside the zone of the armies is undesirable until success on land has been assured. The Air Ministry report, however, that a school of thought is gaining ground in Germany that the air force will prove decisive in the next war, especially against Great Britain. This school maintains that a decision on land against the French fortified frontier would take so long and the resulting economic ruin would be so great that the main effort should be directed towards establishing an air force superior to the enemy and seeking a decision by aircraft attack. The Chiefs of Staff cannot at present say which of these views will prevail.7. On the adequacy of an Expeditionary Force of the size proposed, the Chiefs of Staff emphasise that they cannot foresee the course of a campaign, and state that preparations must be made for an expansion in order to provide forces not only for the reinforcement of the original Expeditionary Force, but to deal with the possible spread of the conflict to other parts of the world in which our overseas possessions may be threatened.8. The effect of the increase in the speed and range of aircraft will, in the opinion of the Chiefs of Staff, make defence more difficult, reducing the period of warning of attack, and making it possible for the attackers to penetrate further over vital centres of Great Britain. In general, technical improvement in aircraft increases the difficulties of the defensive in warfare. These considera-tions strengthen their view as to the importance of the Low Countries, as our own counter-offensive would start nearer their objectives than would German attacks on England, giving us the superiority of position. As speed and range increase, the importance of warning of attack, and depth for the defence is increased.9. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff has submitted an impressive Memorandum (D.C. (M) (32) 111), in which his colleagues concur, on the effect of the French fortifications in the problem under consideration. He introduces the subject by pointing out that it is &quot; the probable situation in some years&apos; time,, when Germany has rearmed, which must be considered, not the situation of to-day or of the immediate future,&quot; subject to a possible exception in the case where the political rulers of Germany find their regime in danger and their power waning.
&quot; The principal objects of fortifying a land frontier may be briefly summarised as follows : (a) To delay an attack and give time for the mobilisation, concentrationand deployment of the main armies.(b) To protect vital objectives from a surprise attack.(c) To economise the man power required for passive defence, and sorelease larger forces for the active operations essential to victory.&quot;&quot; No fortifications,&quot; he continues, &quot; can hold out for an indefinite period against skilful and determined attack without the assistance given by a field army, nor are they intended to do so.&quot; By fortifying her frontiers France may be able to reduce the effectives required for its protection in the early stages by as much as 50 per cent. The Germans, however, would not require large forces to contain the garrison of the fortifications at points whei-e no attack is intended, and will be free to concentrate the mass of their resources where they intend to seek a decision. This points towards an attack through Belgium or even Holland. Here the important fact emerges &apos;&apos; that Germany, with her large and increasing superiority of man power,will be stronger in the field than France can ever be.....   The military value of her allies is doubtful, and the fighting qualities of her native troops are not of the high standard called for in a war against Germany.&quot;After describing the French fortifications in detail, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff comments : &quot; No system of fortifications on such a grand scale can be continuous or present an impenetrable barrier throughout its length.&quot;The effect of the fortifications, therefore, appears to be to increase the likelihood of an attack on Belgium or even Holland.&quot; The French plans,&quot; however, &quot; aim primarily at preserving French territory inviolate in the opening stages of the war. The French do not, and, indeed, they cannot, unaided, hope to ensure the integrity of Belgium, far less that of Holland. French interests, moreover, unlike our own, do not make the security of the Low Countries a vital factor for her.&quot;10. Turning to the question of Holland, the general view of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, which is supported with full details, is that &quot; Holland is just as important to us, from the point of view of sea-power, to-day as in the past. It is more important from the point of view of air defence. It is only less important to us than Belgium because it is further away, and, owing to the nature of the country, is more defensible. .... Our security demands that the Germans should be prevented, if possible, from over-running Holland, obtaining access to the sea, and the use of the Dutch harbours and estuaries, and obtaining possession of the Dutch aerodromes and ground organisations in the neighbourhood of Amsterdam and Utrecht.&quot;11. Whether Germany will attempt to operate through Holland appears to the Chiefs of Staff doubtful. By doing-so Germany would obtain the following-advantages : (i) By crossing the so-called Limburg Peninsula she &apos;&apos; could deploy greaterforces from the outset and hope to outflank the Belgian defences from ; the North.&quot;(ii) By over-running Holland she would obtain the use of the Dutch ports of which Texel (Helder), Ymuiden, the Hook of Holland, and especially Flushing (with its deep water anchorage) are the most important.(iii) She would control the approaches through the Schelde to Antwerp.which would lose any naval value to the Allies.(iv) She would obtain territory for the establishment of air bases which arenearly as important as those which might be established in Belgium.
Against these advantages Germany would have to weigh the following disadvantages: (a) The alienation of world opinion.(6) Diplomatic, financial, and especially economic considerations which, in the last war, deterred her from attempting to over-run Holland.&quot; . . . . it may be argued that Germany, especially if at war with France and Belgium, is likely to respect the neutrality of Holland so as to obtain imports through her ports, so long as the active participation of the United States against Germany appears improbable.&quot;(c) The risks of &apos;; bringing yet another enemy into the field, particularlyone through whose country her great defensive position of the Rhine could be turned and the Ruhr directly threatened.&quot; The Dutch are &quot; an obstinate people, passionately devoted to their native soil, and would fight stubbornly as in the past against an invader. The nature of the country is all in favour of the defence, and would probably lessen the advantages which the German Army would obtain in more favourable country from its superior training and mobility.&quot;(d) In case of success &apos;&apos; the very considerable forces which would berequired to secure any occupied territory, and to protect its coastline.&quot;12. In spite of all this the information at the disposal of the General Staff tends to show that the French, Belgian and Dutch General Staffs all consider that, in a future Franco-German war, the Germans are likely to invade Dutch territory. As the French and Belgian frontier defences are increased and improved it becomes more advantageous to the Germans to attempt to outflank their defences by moving through Dutch territory. The Chiefs of Staff report that &quot; There can be no doubt of the determination of the Dutch to defend their territory, but it is significant that they rely upon the certainty of having Allies.&quot;Plans were made, both before and during the late war, for sending military forces from this country to assist the Dutch, and the Chiefs of Staff consider that &quot; if that help is provided, even in the shape of small forces, there seems every probability that they would be able to put up a successful defence. It would, therefore, seem that we should be prepared, if necessary, to provide that assistance which they require, and on which they are known to rely.&quot;13. The Chiefs of Staff conclude their appreciation on Holland with the following passage : &quot; The forces which Germany is at present believed to possess are insufficient to give us any indication of-what her future policy might be, and we think, therefore, that this problem is one which should be subject to periodic review in the light of the developments which may take place in Germany. We may be in a far better position in a few years&apos; time to consider this problem on a less conjectural basis.&quot;
APPENDIX IV.Imperial Defence (Air Policy).Announcement made by the Lord President of the Council in the House ot Commons on Thursday, July 19, 1934.EVER since the War, successive Governments in this country have actively pursued a policy of international disarmament. In our efforts to further this policy, by example as well as precept, we have reduced our own armaments to a dangerously low level in the hope that others would follow our lead. But, the disarmament negotiations have been drawn out longer than anyone anticipated. The Preparatory Commission lasted from 1926 to December 1930 inclusive. The Disarmament Conference opened on the 2nd February, 1932, and has pursued its labours ever since. During these 8-g- years misgivings have arisen from time to time in many quarters at the increasing accumulation of deficiencies in our Defence Services, particularly in view of the increased expenditure on armaments in many other countries.Most of the Leaders of all three Parties are familiar with the position in its general outline, not only from knowledge acquired while in office, but also from a Three-Party Conference on Disarmament in 1931, in the privacy of which all the facts of the situation were disclosed in confidence.The Governments policy remains one of international disarmament, and we have by no means abandoned hope of reaching some limitation. As mentioned in the Debate on the 13th July, we are even now making fresh efforts to break the virtual deadlock that exists at Geneva. Unfortunately, however, particularly in view of past experience, we cannot count on an early result, and in view of our com-commitments under the Covenant of the League and the Locarno Treaty, the many symptoms of unrest in Europe and elsewhere, and the failure of other Governments to follow our example by comparable reductions, we have for some time felt that the time has come when the possibility of keeping our armaments at their present low level must be reconsidered in the absence of comparable reductions by other Powers. This is a situation which I believe Leaders of all Parties have foreseen must sooner or later be reached.In the light of these considerations, the whole question of Imperial Defence, and the part to be played in it by the three Defence Services, has been for some months under review by the Government. It is not necessary to-day to give any complete account of our enquiries or of the detailed conclusions at which we have arrived. The deficiencies which it will be necessary to make good are largely deficiencies in equipment and stores which, as I mentioned in my speech on the 21st March, have grown up owing to financial stringency and the discussions on disarmament. In these respects the results of our enquiries will be reflected in the Estimates for future years, and can be more conveniently discussed when those Estimates are debated.So far as the Royral Air Force is concerned, however, the position is rather different. Here it is a case of the need for further development, which has time and again been postponed, in addition to the need for making good deficiencies. We have come to the conclusion that we cannot delay any longer measures which will, in the course of the next few years, bring our Air forces to a level more closely approaching that of our nearest neighbours. Moreover, in the case of the Royal Air Force specific undertakings have been given that an announcement will be made before the end of the present Session.Before coming to the programme wTe have decided to adopt, I would emphasise that many factors which have influenced our decision are still fluctuating and liable to change. This applies equally to the future of disarmament and the whole international situation. Consequently, our defensive position will have to be kept constantly under review, and we reserve the right to modify or adjust the programme in the light of new factors that may arise.
Subject to this caveat, we have decided on a programme covering the present and the four ensuing years under which the Royal Air Force will be increased by-41 new Squadrons.including those already announced in the 1934 programme.Of these 41 Squadrons, 33 will be allotted to Home Defence, raising the existing 42 Squadrons at home to a total of 75 Squadrons. The remaining Squadrons are for service with the Fleet Air Arm or abroad. The rate at which this programme can be carried out within the five years must depend upon various considerations, including finance, which I cannot specify now. We hope, however, so to space out the work as not to make an unmanageable addition to the estimates in any one year.
