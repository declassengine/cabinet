(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OR HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO.SECRET .CP.  194  (34 ) .CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation by the Government of India, dated 13th July, 1934.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India dated 13th July, 1934,  issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.During the last month Congress workers in the Provinces have been busy with work of reorganisation, but provincial reports show that this is not an easy task, and that attempts to create enthusiasm have not achieved much success.    It is reported, however, from the United Provinces that certain Congress leaders have been addressing a number of meetings in rural areas in Allahabad district, the real object of which appears to be to excite disaffection against the Government.    This is a tendency which is sure to manifest itself elsewhere and it will be necessary to see that it is kept in check.The absence of enthusiasm for Congress at the present stage is hardly surprising, for, apart from the discredit attaching to acknowledged failure of civil disobedience, there are growing signs of dissension between the various groups of which Congress is composed. The Congress Parliamentary Board are still far from a solution of the policy to be adopted towards the communal award and the disputes on this point during the meeting held at Bombay about the middle of June were so heated that they were unable to agree on an election manifesto.Doctor Ansari , before leaving for Europe, interpreted the Patna resolution a3 meaning that as long as an agreed substitute for the award could not be found, the question of its acceptance or rejection did not arise.   Malaviya and Aney opposed this view and held that
the award could not in any circumstances he accepted. The former view satisfied the nationalist Muslims , who have made it clear that the rejection of the award would result in their complete failure at the poll. The latter view is that strongly held by the Hindu Mahasabha.   Mr. Gandhi tried to reconcile these conflicting views by saying that ths Board should condemn the award unequivocally but should make it clear that the present is not the time for either acceptation or rejection.    This led Malaviya and Aney to tender their resignations and. it was with difficulty that Gandhi could persuade them to reconsider their decision.    It is generally believed, however,  that unless they receive satisfaction at the Working Committee meeting at the end of the month they will resign finally.The attitude which the main body of Congress will take up towards the Congress Socialist Party is also a matter of uncertainty,  and it is possible that development of this party may lead to a serious split in the Congress ranks.    At Patna, this group did not present a well-organised front, but there is no doubt that a programme of revolutionary socialism and of mass action based on an economic appeal, strongly attracts many of the younger Congress workers,  and there are signs that some success is being achieved in forming branches in various centres.    There is thus every probability that this party,  though severely handicapped by the absence of its leader, Jawahar Lai Nehru, will assert itself at the next Congress session in Bombay in October.    Hitherto, Mr.  Gandhi and the
3*Working Committee have discouraged it and in a resolution issued at Bombay on Juno 18th drew attention to the fact that confiscation and class wars are contrary to the Congress creed of non-violence,  dough adding that Congress contemplated wiser and juster distribution of private property so as to prevent exploitation of the landless poor.In view of these differences of opinion, considerable importance    attaches to the meeting of the Congress Working Committee and of the Parliamentary Board which will be held at Benares at the end of this month.    At that meeting Er.  Gandhi may also make clear his personal intentions, which are at present shrouded in mystery, which he likes to preserve till the last moment.    It will be recollected (vide appreciation dated 22nd September, 1933 ) that he announced, after his release in August last,  that he would not court imprisonment by aggressive civil resistance till the period for which he was sentenced to imprisonment had expired.    This period expires on August    3rd and many of the Congress leaders appear apprehensive that he may attempt to retire into the seclusion of a prison.    Pressure is being brought to bear on him not to do so and he has recently issued a statement   announcing his intention of fasting for a week,  as a penance, because of violence used by one of his followers against a Sanatanist.    This fast will not finish before August 14th.The refusal of the Government to remove the ban on the Red Shirt organisation has, as was anticipated, given rise to a good deal of criticism in Congress circles and in Nationalist ones also.    In the North West Frontier Province itself this measure has been taken for granted by the average citizen and has provoked little comment.
In Bombay the strike in textile mills has ended. In Bengal there has been no deterioration in the terrorist situation,  though a somewhat serious mail robbery was committed by terrorists in Assam.    A bomb, not of a very dangerous character, was thrown when Mr. Gandhi v/as driving to a meeting at Poona.      It was clearly intended for Mr. Gandhi,  although no evidence has yet been obtained to show who was responsible for the outrage.      It has been generally assumed it was the work of Sanatanists.      The outrage shocked opinion and has probably had some effect in bringing home to a wider circle the dangers of terrorist mentality.
