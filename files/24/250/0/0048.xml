TO BE  KEPT  UNDER  LOCK  AND KEY.THIS DOCUM _______ tfERNMENTIt is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.SECBET. Copy No.CP. 223 (34).CABINET.THE FUTURE OF ANGLO-JAPANESE RELATIONS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.THE Cabinet have been promised a paper on the above subject, with special reference to the suggestion that has been put forward of the possibility of negotiating and entering into a non-aggression pact with Japan. This memorandum, after recounting the recent history of the matter, sets out the main considerations which have to be weighed and borne in mind, and indicates the conditions which, it would seem, would have to be fulfilled if the objective of a good and firm understanding with Japan is to be attained by such means, without reactions in other directions so serious as to nullify its good effects, i2. Mr. Hirota, the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs, has on several occasions recently dropped the hint that the development of closer relations between Britain and Japan would be welcome. (See Sir Robert Clive&apos;s telegrams No. 172 of the 3rd July, No. 209 of the 30th August, and No. 232 of the 29th September.) This last telegram records our Ambassadors attempt to probe Mr. Hirota&apos;s meaning when he referred to the willingness of Japan &quot; to sign non-aggression pacts with England and America.&quot; The enquiry did not produce a useful explanation, and Sir Robert Clive indicates that he thinks this is more likely to be obtained at the London end through Mr. Matsudaira. Discreet steps with this object are being taken (see conversation recorded in despatch to Tokyo. No. 624, of the 8th October). We are still awaiting any further information which Mr. Matsudaira can give us after receiving his special instructions.3. There can, of course, be no doubt as to the immense advantages which might flow from assured friendship with Japan, so long as the gain is not off-set by very material disadvantages elsewhere. The paramount consideration in this matter, to which everything else home politics, economy, or desire for disarma-ment must be subject, is the safety, first of this country, and then of the British Empire. At this moment, in the autumn of 1934. there is no immediate threat to our safety. But there is the universal feeling of apprehension about the future, and the near future, that such a threat may materialise, and that the quarter from which it will come is Germany. Whatever may be the outcome of the present regime in Germany, we need not anticipate that we should have to fight her single-handed, and although the results of any war between civilised peoples must necessarily result in appalling loss and suffering, we might reason-ably hope to escape ultimate disaster if the hostilities were confined to European nations. But if we had to enter upon such a struggle with a hostile, instead of a friendly, Japan in the East; if we had to contemplate the division of our forces so as to protect our Far Eastern interests while prosecuting a war in Europe; then not only would India, Hong Kong and Australasia be in dire peril, but we ourselves would stand in far greater danger of destruction by a fully armed and organised Germany.7621   [10658] b
4. There is therefore everything to be said for pursuing such a policy and making such arrangements as will best secure ourselves from attack in the Far East by the Power whose hostility at a difficult time might undermine our whole position.&apos; We may anticipate that India. Australia and New Zealand, amongst others, would warmly approve such a course. Mr. Bennett, in recent conversa-tions with Ministers in London, has been expressing the view that Canada also greatly desires to see Anglo-Japanese relations on the best footing. If there was nothing to be set on the other side the gain would be enormous. As against the advantage we have to consider fully and carefully what the disadvantages and dangers may be and whether there is any way of overcoming them.5. So far as external politics are concerned, the main topics of difficulty in connexion with any Anglo-Japanese non-aggression pact may be grouped under the heads of China, the United States and Russia. There is also to be considered the effect of such an arrangement upon the League of Nations and our attitude at Geneva. This paper, therefore, proposes to examine the above-named topics ef difficulty and to enquire whether there are any conditions or guarantees which, if they were associated with the suggested non-aggression pact, would remove manifest objections. It may be said at once that, in relation to all these matters, a pact with Japan which amounted to or could be regarded as giving Japan carte blanche so long as she respected her promise not to attack any part of the British Commonwealth, is manifestly impossible. Those who favour the idea of seeking some special compact with Japan do not contemplate anything of the kind. Our obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty, our trading&apos; interests in China, our right to the Open Door and our obligations under the Covenant rule out from the start any notion of purchasing a promise from Japan that she will leave us alone at the price of giving her a free hand.6. As for China, the Nine-Power Treaty (see Appendix) bound the contracting Powers other than China &quot; to respect the sovereignty, the independence and the territorial and administrative integrity of Chinax&apos; (Article I), and under the Treaty the contracting Powers &quot; agree not to enter into any treaty, agreement, arrangement, or understanding, either with one another, or, individually or collectively, with any Power or Powers, which would infringe or impair the principles stated in Article I &quot; (Article II). The story of Manchukuo shows how little Japan has observed these stipulations so far as regards the four Chinese provinces outside the Great Wall. That, however, is largely past, history, and the important thing, both for China and for ourselves, is that Japanese aggression and penetration should not pass the Great Wall and invade or monopolise China proper. Mr. Matsudaira&apos;s reference to this subject in his conversation of the 8th October, though expressing only a tentative and personal view, is not unhopeful. If, indeed, Japan were prepared to enter into a new and specific assurance which would guarantee the integrity of China proper, without prejudice to the position on either side as regards Manchukuo, this might provide in the eyes of China something of real value in a special AnglO-Japanese arrangement which otherwise it would be impossible to justify. While it would be difficult to frame the guarantee in such a way as not to amount to a recognition of Manchukuo and an abandonment of the line hitherto taken by the League of Nations in reference to it, an undertaking which definitely called a halt to Japanese penetration into China, contained in an instrument signed both by Japan and by ourselves (we leave out for the moment the question whether the United States could not also be a party) would be of the greatest practical value to China and to British trade with China, as well as making a material contribution to peace in the Far East. If, when Japan states the conditions which she would be prepared to see attached to the proposed pact, Japan declines terms which would safeguard the interests of China, then this would be fatal to the proposed pact. But if we could secure such conditions, the matter would wear an entirely different and much more hopeful aspect.7. As regards the United States, there can of course be no doubt that Anglo-Japanese approaches, designed to lead to a bilateral agreement between ourselves and Japan, are calculated, unless most discreetly handled, to arouse suspicion and resentment to a high degree. We set out some of the considerations tending1 to lead to such a result, for the purpose of seeing how best they might be overcome.
America believes that some day she will have to fight Japan, and throughout the United States the conclusion of an Anglo-Japanese pact (unless accompanied by a simultaneous American-Japanese pact) would tend to be regarded as meaning that, when the moment came, our influence and sympathy would be on the side of Japan. It is therefore exceedingly important that the proposal should be in a form which would serve Americans interests as well as our own.The urgency of the matter is bound up with the present state and prospects of the naval discussions. As the result of our preliminary talks with Mr. Norman Davis, we have agreed that we will not abate our opposition to any alteration to the ratio 5:5:3 without first communicating with the Americans. In return for this concession we have received nothing, for Mr. Davis, while declaring that he quite understood our reasons for wanting the programme which we disclosed to him, was at pains to reiterate that he would be misleading us if he allowed us to think for a moment that it would be accepted by the American Senate. No doubt the attitude which the United States would like best would be that we should make common cause with them in the naval discussions against Japan and meet Japan&apos;s refusal to accept the present fractional inferiority by declaring that, in that event, we shall make no agreement, but will join the United States in outbuilding her whatever she does. We shall not be able to gratify American feelings by making such a declaration, and it is therefore very desirable, in American interests as well as our own, to find some other way of curbing Japanese intransigeance.There are strong indications that Japan would prefer to terminate the Washington Treaty if she cannot secure its amendment in her favour. It is a striking fact that both Mr. Hirota and Mr. Matsudaira within the last few days have asserted that Japan has no objection to the greater size of the British navy; what she objects to is that the Japanese navy should be smaller than the American. Since we presumably cannot accept the American invitation to join her in meeting Japan&apos;s demands by threatening to lay down two keels for one. the prospect of agreement as regards the size of navies (as distinguished from agreement on qualitative matters) appears far from good.Yet the prospect of unlimited building, both by Japan and by the United States, is very disturbing. Supposing, then, that the Japanese reply to our enquiry as to the implications of Mr. Hirota&apos;s suggestion of a non-aggression pact gave any encouragement to pursue the idea, and supposing that the imminent preliminary discussions on naval problems show that agreement is very unlikely, it might be possible at that stage to approach the United States with the suggestion that Japanese naval claims (which profess to be based on the fear of aggression) would be materially modified if a non-aggression pact could be entered into by Japan with both the United States and the British Empire preferably in a single instrument. Such an instrument would have to contain the reaffirma-tion and, if possible, strengthening of the assurances of the Nine-Power Treaty as regards China proper, as well as the confirmation of the Four-Power Treaty to respect the rights of the respective parties in relation to their insular possessions in the Pacific (see also note to Appendix). This latter treaty (see Appendix), which was negotiated at the same time as the Nine-Power Treaty, is liable to termination by twelve months&apos; notice given by any party, and it would be necessary to stipulate that it should not be terminated during the period of the proposed pact. If the United States were prepared, as a means of reducing Japan&apos;s naval demands and as a contribution to peace in the Pacific, to contem-plate a tripartite pact of this nature&apos;, the difficulties above pointed out would be largely removed. If, on the other hand, the United States Avere to refuse to contemplate such a pact, and, accepting the breakdown, were to insist instead on building a&apos;*jh&amp;vy without restriction, with Japan following suit, she could take no reasonable exception to ,our pursuit of a bilateral agreement with Japan, the need for which would be more pressing than ever.8. As regards Soviet Russia, anything which makes Japan feel more secure tends to encourage her in an aggressive attitude towards Russia. It may well be that Russia&apos;s admission to the League of Nations will cause Japan to adopt a less aggressive policy the settlement of the dispute about the Chinese Eastern Railway, which has occurred since Russia&apos;s entry, may be an illustration of this. Japan&apos;s attitude in favour of a definite policy of Anglo-Japanese friendship is in part inspired by the desire to secure our benevolence in the event of Soviet-Japanese relations becoming extremely strained. On the other hand, the fact [10658] b 2.. - \-i.:&apos;--;^.vj.,..v;v^.,,.&apos;.7.,..r.*,,.w..,.,n,.....,,,,t,,......
that the relation of Japan and Russia to the League of Nations has now been reversed, Russia coming in and Japan going out, may mean, in the event of a Russo-Japanese war, an increased anxiety for ourselves as a member of the League. Therefore, the creation of especially friendly relations between ourselves and Japan would help to correct the balance and to maintain the neutral attitude which we should beyond question have to adopt. There is always the possibility, though it is only a possibility, that once specially friendly, relations have been established with Japan, Japan might consider coming back to the League.9. It may be objected that, whatever may be the advantages of securing a non-aggression pact between Japan, the British Commonwealth and the United States, Japan might, at a time of special opportunity, be tempted to disregard it Japan&apos;s record in observing her treaty relations in regard to China is not a good one. But the contrast we have to make is between the risks of the position without any such specific assurance and the improved situation which would flow from and be backed by such an assurance. Moreover, it is not proposed to substitute mere political assurances for naval limitation in the sense that Japan, after once entering into the pact of non-aggression, would construct an unlimited navy. The idea rather is to use the negotiation of a non-aggression pact as a lever for reducing Japan&apos;s naval programme. The Japanese desire to increase their relative naval strength vis-a-vis of the United States is dictated mainly by their fear of strained relations developing between their two countries and leading ultimately to war. In the measure that political appeasement can be introduced, Japanese naval pretensions are likely to abate.For the moment, however, we have to await Mr. Matsudaira&apos;s further -communication as to any special instructions he may receive.J.

Extract from the Nine-Power Treaty.(Concluded at Washington on the 6th February, 1922, between the United States of America, Belgium, the British Empire, China, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and Portugal.)Article 1.The Contracting Powers, other than China, agree : 1. To respect the sovereignty, the independence, and the territorial andadministrative integrity of China; 2. To provide the fullest and most unembarrassed opportunity to China todevelop and maintain for herself an effective and stable Government; 3. To use their influence for the purpose of effectually establishing and maintaining the principle of equal opportunity for the commerce andindustry of all nations throughout the territory of China; 4. To refrain from taking advantage of conditions in China in order to seekspecial rights or privileges which would abridge the rights of subjectsor citizens of friendly States, and from countenancing action inimicalto the security of such States.Article 2.The Contracting Powers agree not to enter into any treaty, agreement, arrangement, or understanding, either with one another, or, individually or collectively, with any Power or Powers, which Avould infringe or impair the principles stated in Article 1.Extract from, the Four-Power Treaty.(Concluded at Washington on the 13th December. 1921, between the United States of America, the British Empire, France and Japan.)Article 1.The High Contracting Parties agree as between themselves to respect their rights in relation to their insular possessions and insular dominions in the region of the Pacific Ocean.If there should develop between any of the High Contracting Parties a controversy arising out of any Pacific question and involving their said rights which is not satisfactorily settled by diplomacy and is likely to affect the harmonious accord now happily subsisting between them, they shall invite the other High Contracting Parties to a joint conference to which the whole subject will be referred for consideration and adjustment.Article 2.If the said rights are threatened by the aggressive action of any other Power, the High Contracting Parties shall communicate with one another fully and frankly in order to arrive at an understanding as to the most efficient measures to be taken, jointly or separately, to meet the exigencies of the particular situation.Article 3.This Treaty shall remain in force for ten years from the time it shall take effect, and after the expiration of said period, it shall continue to be in force subject to the right of any of the High Contracting Parties to terminate it upon twelve months&apos; notice.
Identic Communication made to the Netherlands (February 4, 1922) and Portuguese (February 6, 1922) Governments on behalf of the British Empire, and also, mutatis mutandis, on behalf of the other Powers signatory to the Quadruple Pacific Treaty.*The British Empire has concluded, on the 13th December, 1921, with the United States of America, France and Japan, a Treaty with a view to the preservation of general peace and the maintenance of their rights to their insular possessions and insular dominions in the region of the Pacific Ocean. They have agreed thereby as between themselves to respect their rights in relation to these possessions and dominions.The Netherlands not being signatory to the said Treaty, and the Netherlands possessions in the region of the Pacific Ocean therefore not being included in the agreement referred to, His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, anxious to forestall any conclusion contrary to the spirit of the Treaty, desires to declare that it is firmly resolved to respect the rights of the Netherlands in relation to her insular possessions in the region of the Pacific Ocean.* Jotc. This undertaking by Japan to respect the rights of the Netherlands in the Dutch East Indies is especially important in view of Japan&apos;s alleged ambitions in that region. This is the principal reason for ensuring that the Four-Power Treaty (which is subject to one year&apos;s. denunciation by any party) should be kept in force during the period of validity of any Anglo-Japanese Non-Aggression Pact.0
