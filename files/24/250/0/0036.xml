CONFIDENTIAL.A.C. 303.BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.STATE OF TRADEJULY 1934.Summary of Reports, submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council.     (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.    Imports in July, 1934,-were  58.0 m. as compared with  53.7 m. in July, 1933.     Exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures were  33.2 m. oompared with  29.9 m,, while re-exports were  4.1 m. as compared with  4.3 m. The excess of Imports over exports of merchandise was  20,7 m, for July, 1934, as compared with  19.4 m. in July, 1933, and was the smallest for any month since July, 1933.     For the seven months ended July the excess this year was  164.m. and last year  139 m.EMPLOYMENT.   The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at 23rd July was 2,126,260, an increase of 33,674 as compared with 25th June. The main variations were:-The estimated number of insured persons In employment at 23rd July was 10,136,000, a decrease of 27,000 as compared with previous months but an increase of 394,000 as compared with a year ago.The improvement shown in previous months continued during July in engineering, shipbuilding and ship repairing, tinplate and electrical apparatus manufacture, and in the shipping and hotel and boarding house services.     There was also a substantial increase In the numbers at work in the ooal-mining industry.     On the other hand,employment declined in building and london )South Eastern ) South Western )Midlands.......North Eastern.. North Western..Scotland.......Wales..........4-11,408 -1-20,321 - 6,3974- 5,195* 8,803 - 5,656
public works contracting and also in the cotton, woollen and worsted and certain other textile industries, in the clothing trades, including boot and shoe manufacture, and in the motor vehicle Industry.RAIL AND RCAD TRAFFIC .   During the four weeks ended 29th July railway traffic receipts increased by  231,000 or nearly 2% over the corresponding period of 1933, the Increase in passenger traffic being 1.42%, In coal, coke and patent fuel 0.20$, and In other freight train traffic 3.67$.Motor vehicles newly registered in June totalled 2?,972, an increase of 4,857 (or 21%) over a year ago.     Of the increase 3,643 was in private cars and 1,174 in goods vehicles.     New registrations of motor-cycles in June amounted to 5,189, an Increase of 31.1$ over the previous June.FINANCE.   The San Francisco strikes and the assassination of Dr. Dollfuss had no appreciable effect on the London stock market. Money was easy, and as the total of Treasury Bills issued fell by a further  17,165,000 Bill rates showed weakness.     The rate of allotment of Treasury Bills declined progressively from 17/- at the end of June to 13/10 per cent, at the end of July.Sterling was weak throughout the month, but owing to the operation of the Control the dollar and franc exchanges did not vary by more than 2f cents and 25 centimes respectively.COAL. The  average weekly output of coal during the 13 weeks ended 21st July was 3,984,000 tons oompared with 3,763,000 a year ago, being an Increase of 6%,     The average number of persons employed during this period was 774,000 against 769,500 a year before.     Home consumption of coal and coke in June was Q% higher than in June, 1933.     Exports in July were 108,000 tons (3%) more than a year earlier.     Increased tonnages were consigned to Canada, Scandinavia and Argentina, but exports to France, Italy and Belgium declined.     Imports of Polish coal Into the Irish Free State again increased in June at the expense of imports from Great Britain and Germany,The prospects for the immediate future are encouraging,
MOTOR TRAPS.    There was every indication of a continuation, of good &quot;business in the home market, although some falling off is to be expected in view of the announcement of manufacturers&apos; new programmes in August.     As regards Empire trade there were signs of improvement in New Zealand, and further progress was made in the South African market;    in India, however, some ground was lost to the United States of America, whose sales in other overseas markets continue to cause anxiety.MACHINE TOOLS.    The position in the home trade remains comparatively satisfactory.      Exports for the month of July amounted to  163,000 as against  175,000 in June and  118,000 in May.     Exports to Russia were  62,000 in July and  76,000 in June as compared with  27,000 in May.      These figures show that some of the orders placed since the Trade Agreement are now reaching the shipment stage.      Trade with Prance and other Continental countries is still unsatisfactory.LIGHTER METAL TRADES.    Except for architectural metalwork, trade is generally satisfactory., the seasonal lull in certain sections being less than usual.      In the cutlery, silver and 2).P.N.S. section goods of high quality are in better demand. Exports of tools are now nearly up to the 1929 peak level and prospects are encouraging.     In the case of locks, there is competition both in the home and Dominion markets from American manufacturers who, it is claimed, are using the Canadian corridor.     In the non-ferrous metal trades copper has been cheap and it is thought that this will in the long run stimulate its use, which has been challenged by other materials.    Prices of zinc and lead remain low.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.   During July, 1,042 million units of electricity were produced, as compared with 913 million units a year before.     The percentage of productive capacity in use, which was over 60fa in June, rose slightly, and there was some increase in employment.      In the case of heavy plant, orders received in the home market were about the same as a year ago,
but there was a further increase In export orders.     iilxports of light apparatus in June were  636,000, as compared with  588,000 in May, the increase being almost entirely due to better exports to non-Empire markets.The Central Electricity Board have approved a proposal to extend, at a cost of some  5,000,000 the output capacity of selected grid stations by-over 500,090 kw.    It is doubted, however, whether these extensions will be sufficient to meet the rapidly increasing demand for electricity.COTTON.    There was a seasonal decline in activity in the cotton trade in July.     In the Egyptian and fine American spinning sections production is being seriously affected by the -cessation of yarn deliveries to Germany.The rise in raw cotton prices which began towards the end of May still continues.The export trade in cotton goods was generally better than in June.     The main increase was in shipments to India, which were 23? million square yards higher than in July, 1933.    The near and middle Sast markets continue, however, to be unsatisfactory.     Trade with the Dominions improved and the institution of the quota system in the Colonies has led to increased inquiries.CrLiiiMICALS.     In the alkaline and heavy chemical section deliveries in the home market continued to be good while exports were steadily maintained.    Sales of dyestuffs for July showed a satisfactory Increase, but there Is a seasonal decline in the demand for coal tar products.      The demand for wood distillation products and pharmaceutical products continues reasonably steady.SOAP, OILS AND KINDRED INDUSTRIES.    Quiet conditions continued generally, though there is a slight tendency for the demand for edible oils and fats to improve.     The margarine market remains affected by the large supplies of butter on offer. The general&quot;advance in the price of cereals has tended to push up the price of all feeding stuffs.
PAPBfi.    There was little change in the conditions of the paper trade during July.     The distinct improvement in the demand for fine papers and paper hoards continued, hut there was a somewhat reduced demand for newsprint and wrapping papers.     The recent increase in the duty on paper hoards has stimulated activity in this section of the industry.00-OPBRATIVE TRADE.    The Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s sales for the 5 weeks to the 1.4th July show an increase of 13.0$ as compared with the corresponding period of last year. The weighted wholesale prices of seven of the principal commodities have decreased by 3.24% as compared with a year ago and retail prices have increased by 0.31$ *n the same basis.WOOL.    There was a further decline in the general activity of the industry as a whole during July.     Unemployment increased, particularly in worsted weaving.     The index number of machinery activity as at June 30th was 71.3$ as compared with 75.2$ at the end of May, and 79.3% at the end of June, 1933.There was, however, a marked increase in the exports of wool tissues in July as compared with the previous month, although the exports of tops showed a slight decrease.     Prices of raw wool also continued to decline during the month.There seems little to suggest that the near future will show any material improvement in the general activity of the industry.EMPIRE.CANADIAN TRADE.   The index of business operations in June showed a gain of 15.6% over June, 1933, and wholesale prices reached their highest point since May, 1931.    Compared with May, 1934, shipments of gold and lead increased, though copper, nickel, zinc and silver declined.     Manufacturing also fell from its previous high level and automobile production recorded its first seasonally adjusted decline for the year.     Total imports were 37.4% and exports 26.2% more than in June, 1933.
AUSTRALIAN TRADE.     Total imports during June amounted to  7,386,000 (Australian currency) being  1,715,000 more than a year ago.   Butter exports so far this season amount to 2,051 cons compared with 1,441 tons, and wheat exports to 41.8 million bushels compared with 102 million for the same period last year.    The amount of wool received into store in one year ended June, 1954, amounted to 2.7 million bales as against 2.9 million bales in the year ended June,1935.INDIA.    Both imports and exports during July, 1934, showed an improvement when oompared with June, 1934, although they are still below the average of the Imports and exports for the last six months.    The wholesale price index number (July 1914 * 100) for July, 1934, at Oaloutta was 89 as against 90 for the previous two months.The monsoon reports appear to be satisfactory all over India.    Standing crops are generally in fair to good condition.The first estimate of the area covering the 1934/55 ootton crop is nearly 13 million acres.    The revised final forecast for last year was nearly 14 million acres.Board of Trade,25th August, 1934.
