8SEC RE T. fCAP,  175 (54) . GOIT HO. 6CABIN E T.PUHLIU  .VOKKS LC-\:? PILL,  1954.Mem or- and urn &quot;by the Chancellor&apos; of the Exchequer.1. The main purpose of this Bill is to fix themaximum sum which may he issued to the public Works Loan Commissioners for the purpose of making loans from the Local Loans Fund up to the date of the passing of a further Bill.      It is therefore a recurrent measure, but not necessarily at regular intervals.      As a rule the amount is fixed at a figure somewhat exceeding the estimated require-ments for the next 12 months, so as to allow a margin in case of delay before further statutory powers can be obtained.2. The current Act v/as passed in July 1932 andauthorises lending up to a maximum of  18 millions.      It is estimated that that limit will be reached before the Autumn, and it is therefore necessary to obtain fresh powers before Parliament rises.5. The limit now proposed is  18 millions.      Making areasonable allowance for slum clearance and water supply requirements, advances during the 12 months ending July 1935 are not expected to exceed  12 millions;   but it is thought desirable to provide a fairly wide margin over that figure, partly to provide against the exigencies of the parliamentary time-table, and partly because a lower figure might be criticised as checking the possibility of a desirable expansion in borrowings for capital expenditure.     There is no fear that the higher figure will militate against proper financial
controlo4. I should add that a further Bill will have to hepassed before 31st March, 1936, when the present Commissioners&apos; tenure of office will expire.5. I ask for approval of the present Bill in principle,and for authority to introduce it without delay, subject to examination by the Home Affairs Committee.(Intd.) N.C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I. 2nd July, 1934,
DRAFTOF ABILLTOGrant money for the purpose of certain local AD. 1934. loans out of the Local Loans Fund, and for     &quot; other purposes relating to local loans.BE it enacted by the King&apos;s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, 5 as follows : 1.

public Works Loans. [24 &amp; 25 Geo. 5.]A.D. 1934.-Remission of arrears of principal and interest in respect of Eyemouth Harbour loan.1 Edw. 7. c. 35.Now, therefore, the principal of the said loans to the extent aforesaid shall be written off from the assets of the local loans fund, and the provisions of section fifteen of the said Act shall, so far as applicable, apply thereto.3. Whereas in pursuance of an agreement made in 5 the year eighteen hundred and ninety-two the sum of ten thousand pounds was advanced by the Public Works Loan Commissioners to the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees on the security of the harbour revenues with the collateral security of the Fishery Board for Scotland : 10And whereas by an arrangement confirmed by section three of the Public Works Loans Act, 1901, the liability of the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees in respect of the said loan was extinguished without prejudice to the liability of the Fishery Board for Scotland to repay 15 the said loan, and, in consequence thereof, the said collateral security is the sole security for the repayment of the said loan :And whereas the terms of the said collateral security are embodied in a memorandum of agreement between 20 the Secretary for Scotland and the Public Works Loan Commissioners, dated the eleventh day of March, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, whereby a portion of the surplus herring brand fees as defined in clause three of the said memorandum was pledged in security for the 25 repayment of the said loan with interest by the instal-ments and at the times mentioned in the security given by the Eyemouth Harbour Trustees for the said loan, and it was provided that the said portion of the surplus herring brand fees of any one year should only be 30 applicable to the repayment of the one-fiftieth part of principal and interest on outstanding principal falling due under the security for the said loan in the same year, and should not be applicable to the repayment of arrears of principal. 35And whereas the said portion of the surplus herring-brand fees so pledged as aforesaid was during the year ending the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-three, and the year ending the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-four, insuffi- 40 cient to discharge in full the instalments of principal with interest which fell due under the security for the said loan in those years, and the principal sum of four
hundred pounds with interest amounting to one hundred A.D. 1934.and twenty-seven pounds four shillings, now remains  -unpaid, and under the terms of the said memorandum of agreement is irrecoverable :5 Now, therefore, the said principal sum of four hundred pounds shall be extinguished, and the said arrears of interest amounting to one hundred and twenty-seven pounds four shnlings shall be remitted.4.
