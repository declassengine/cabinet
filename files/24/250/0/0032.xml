Memorandum by the Home Secretary.(l) In his Annual Report for 1933 Lord Trenchardrepresented the urgent need for providing more up to date accommodation and better conditions generally in the Section Houses in which the unmarried constables of the Metropolitan Police Force (between four and five thousand men - more than, a quarter of the constables) reside.      The matter has aroused a great deal of public-attention and much comment in the Press.I attach an extract from the Report (Appendix I) and may say that I am satisfied from personal investigation that the state of affairs is as described by the Commissioner and that the need for remedying it is urgent for the reasons indicated. In the House of Commons on the 5th instant I announced in reply to Questions that I had already approved of four new Section Houses, which would embody the various improvements recommended by the Commissioner,  and that a general programme was being drawn up with all possible speed for the building or reconstruction of other Section Houses on modern lines.(2) Section Houses are only one aspect of the problem with which the Commissioner finds himself confronted as regards buildings.     A large number of stations and married quarters are equally out of date, while at Scotland Yard itself there is great congestion and, as he pointed out in his Report for 1932, important police work is seriously impeded as a result.(3) The Commissioner has now surveyed the whole field andhas outlined a, comprehensive Building Programme which covers
(I) Section Houses,   (II) Married Quarters,   (III) Stations,  and .(IV) an extension of Scotland Yard.     The scheme may he described as one for the general re-housing of the Force, in order that, both externally and in their interior arrangements, London&apos;s police buildings shall be brought up to modern standards and be made worthy of the capital of the Empire and of the position occupied by the Metropolitan Police, while at the same time promoting contentment and efficiency among the men and facilitating the transaction of business with the public.     Lord Trenchard&apos;s proposals and the case for them may be briefly summarised as follows:-(I)    Section Houses. (4) Practically the whole of the existing Section houses are pre-war.      In their general design and equipment they reflect the comparatively low pre-war status of the police, and the standard of comfort and privacy is far below that which is now accepted as reasonable and necessary.There are 115 Section Houses scattered over the District with an average accommodation for 30 men.     Most of them are on the upper floors of station buildings or form part of such buildings, the general principle in the past having been that the men should, so to speak,  &quot;live over the shop&quot;.     These small Section Houses are necessarily cramped,  inconvenient and uncomfortable.      In the years immediately before the war a number of larger detached Section Houses were built to meet the very rapid growth of the Force, but these buildings, although an improvement on the older Section Houses,  are bleak and institution-like with little or no &quot;club atmosphere&quot; about them - see the Commissioner^ Report.The principal improvements that Lord Trenchard proposes are the provision of a properly fitted and heated bed-sitting room for each man, in place of the present cheerless dormitory
cubicles (lighted only from the corridor):    together with canteen, common room and recreation accommodation on an adequate scale, and also a restaurant at which the men will be able to obtain properly cooked meals cheaply at all hours, as and when they come off duty.     Under the present arrangements the catering and service are poor;    only a midday dinner is provided by the Section House mess and the men have to cook their other meals for themselves.      These improvements and the better management of the Section Houses generally can be secured economically only by having fewer and larger Section Houses.      This will be an advantage in many other respects and the men will be more concentrated and therefore more readily available as reserves.Under Lord Trenchard&apos;s scheme the present number of Section Houses, viz. 115, would be reduced to between 50 and 60, the accommodation in each ranging from 60 to 200.      This involves closing all the smaller Section Houses,   reconstructing on modern lines as many of the larger ones as possible, and building a considerable number of new ones .The total expenditure on Section Houses is estimated at between  1,500,000 and  1,750,000.(11)   Married Quarters. (5) Married Quarters are,  generally speaking,  of two kinds,(a) over stations for the station officer, and (b) blocks of flats for married Inspectors, Sergeants and Constables.     A large number of (a) are out of date like the stations of which they form part,  and they compare very unfavourably as regards both accommodation and the conveniences provided, with the newer sets of quarters built.      This is obviously very unsatisfactory and is the cause of a good deal of discontent among the officers who have to occupy the inferior quarters, particularly as many of these are in the more unpleasant neighbourhoods.     The provision of more modern sets of quarters for station officers will be undertaken in connection with the reconstruction of stations.
As regards  (b), there is urgent need of these for the married men in the inner Divisions, in order to enable them to reside within a reasonable distance of the stations to which they are attached.     A Committee presided over by Lord Onslow (of which Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister was also a member) recommended in 1920 that 800 sets of quarters should be provided in the inner Divisions,  but,  owing mainly to the financial restrictions which have prevailed in the interval,  only just half this number have been built in the fourteen years that have since elapsed. The Commissioner is satisfied that the need will not have been met until 1,000 sets have been provided.      The cost of the 600 or more sets required is estimated, for sites and buildings, at between  500,000 and  750,000.(ill)    Stations . (6) There are 182 Police Stations in the MetropolitanPolice District.     Of these 110 were built in Queen Victoria&apos;s reign, forty-five of them prior to 1880, and thirty more than sixty years ago.     The administrative accommodation in these old stations, which may all be described as mean and incommodious structures built in the cheapest possible way,  is totally inadequate to present needs and the provision made for the public is very insufficient.      Of the stations built in the earlier years of the twentieth century many also fall far short of modern standards.A thorough modernisation of the stations would require that between 60 and 70 should be rebuilt or replaced by new stations and that all but about 30 of the remainder should be reconstructed in greater or lesser degree.      The total cost of this programme is estimated at between  1, 250., 000 and  1, 500, 000.(IV)    The, extension of Scotland Yard. (7) The attached memorandum from the Commissioner of Police(Appendix II) sets out the urgent need for additional headquarters
accommodation at New Scotland Yard, and the proposal to provide this by the erection of a new building on the plot of land on the Embankment immediately to the north of the Commissioners office. The cost of this building is estimated at between  400,000 and  500,000.It is possible that this proposal may arouse some opposition on the part of the London County Council or other local authorities, but its inclusion among the purposes for which money may be borrowed under the Loan Bill suggested in paragraph (10) below would afford a convenient opportunity for parliamentary and public discussion cf the proposal.(8) The expenditure involved in the whole of Lord Trenchard&apos;sbuilding programme is thus estimated at between  4,000,000 and  5,000iQOO .      The annual expenditure would be on a gradually increasing scale working up to a peak figure of possibly  1,000,000 in four years1  time.(9) With the exception of New Scotland Yard itself (whichwas built between 1685 and 1890) Metropolitan Police building expenditure has hitherto been met out of income.      The scope of the present scheme is, however,  so large and unprecedented that, if it is to be carried through within a short period, the expenditure involved must be provided for, in part at all events, on a loan basis.     Lord Trendhard has urged that the scheme should be planned as one to be completed in six or seven years, and I am of the opinion that this should be our aim.(10) For this purpose a Bill conferring fresh borrowing powers on the Receiver for the Metropolitan Police District would be necessary,  and it is desired to obtain the approval of the Cabinet to the introduction of such a Bill in the Autumn.      It would be set out in the Bill, (or in the preamble or covering memorandum), and explained in the Debates in Parliament,  that the money was.to be borrowed for all or any of the four purposes
26th July, 1934.indicated in paragraph (2), hut that the extent to which the &quot;borrowing powers would be used would depend upon circumstanoes -in particular the need to avoid any undue burden falling upon the ratepayers,  owing to the necessity of expediting the work instead: of spreading it over a considerable period of years, as would be necessary if it was all to be met from income.      In practice it will no doubt be found possible to meet a considerable part of this expenditure out of income, and it is proposed to fix the maximum amount to be borrowed at  4.000,000.The introduction of a Bill on the lines proposed would . give general publicity to the matter and enable objections, whether to the policy of borrowing or on any other grounds, to be heard and considered before the whole scheme was actually embarked upon.     Parliamentary sanction,  and the public- support which will thus be obtained for the proposals, &amp;&amp;em       jne almost as desirable for this as for Lord Trenchard&apos;s other reforms of 1933,  and to bring the matter before Parliament in the manner proposed will be in accordance with the long established tradition of parliamentary control and criticism of important Metropolitan Police changes or matters of policy.J.G.
APPENDIX     I .:    147Extract from the Re-port of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis for the Year 1933.SECTION HOUSES -AND MARRIED Q.UARTERS .In my last Annual Report I said that many of the existing Section Houses were out of date and &quot;below modern standards of comfort, and I added that I regarded this question as one which must be dealt with at the earliest possible moment.Unfortunately, owing to financial and other reasons,  it has not been possible in the past year to make any progress in the matter.     I have, however, been able to inform myself more fully as to the general conditions in Section Houses, and, as a result, I feel that it is impossible to over-state the deplorable character of the existing state of affairs and the urgent need for improvement.The single men in the force, who number over 4,000 or more than a quarter of the total number of constables, are required by the rules of the service to live in the Section Houses,  save in special cases.     A Section House is, therefore, a constable&apos;s home during the early years of his service, and, as large numbers join from the provinces, they may not even have friends to whom they can occasionally go when off duty.Practically all the Section Houses date from pre-war days, and about half from the Victorian era (1850 onwards).     They were built and equipped when the standard acquiesced in as regards comfort and amenities was far below what can be regarded as reasonable or tolerable to-day.The outstanding defect of the Section Houses is the complete lack of privacy.     Except in the case of three small ones built, and two reconstructed,  since the war,  there is,  speaking generally,
nowhere that a man can read or write or rest in comfort.     There are no separate bedrooms - only narrow cubicles in a cheerless dormitory, separated from each other by thin wooden partitions which do not reach to the ceiling or,  in some cases, to the floor. Apart from the cramped space, which is insufficient even for a man to keep his clothes in, he is prevented from retiring to his cubicle except to sleep, because the only lighting is in the dormitory corridor, where the lights have been made as few and as dim as possible,  in a rather unsuccessful attempt to compromise between illumination for those who wish to see and darkness for those who are trying to sleep.     Electric light has so far been introduced into only a few Section Houses.     The dormitories and cubicles are also very cold in winter and, although central heating is being gradually installed,  a large proportion are still unheated. 1As regards the other accommodation in a Section House,  there is a recreation room, but this is exclusively reserved for billiards,! and a room called a library.      The latter has been usually regarded   I in the past as reserved for study;    more recently a few easy chairs and small writing tables have been supplied with the object of Ibmaking them common rooms of a sort, but they do not lend themselves   I to such use,  owing to their small size or their position, and the change has further the disadvantage of depriving the men of a quiet room for study, which is essential to those working for their   j promotion examinations.The larger Section Houses have canteens, but these do not correspond at all to the ordinary conqeption of a canteen.      They are,  speaking generally,  small dark rooms in basements, where the men can get a glass of beer or buy groceries,  etc.,  but they are not, and were never designed as, places where they could sit or take refreshment in comfort.     Canteens, it should be explained, have been introduced since the Section Houses were built, and have, therefore, had to be squeezed into whatever space could be made available.
As regards meals, the men make their own messing arrangements under which, as a general rule, one hot meal a day is provided (usually at 1 p.m.);    other meals &quot;being cooked &quot;by each man for himself.     The catering arrangements are in need of entire over-haul, with a view to securing that the men (who come off duty at all hours) can obtain well-cooked and properly served meals, as and when they require them,  in a room furnished after the manner Of a comfortable restaurant.      This is essential not only as a matter of comfort but for the health of the men, which undoubtedly suffers at present from unsuitable and insufficiently varied diet, a trouble which cannot be remedied under existing conditions.The whole question of the internal management Of Section Houses needs overhauling.     At present they have a bleak and institution-like atmosphere and are frequently situated in dreary surroundings.     These drawbacks would be at least partially mitigated if the scheme of decoration were improved and if the arrangements for cleaning were put on a better basis.      It will be one of the duties of the Welfare Officer recently appointed at Headquarters to recommend such improvements as may be possible in internal organisation, but the question of catering is not an easy one in view of the smallness of some of the Section Houses and the varying hours of duty of the men.Plans for effecting any drastic improvements in Section Houses have hitherto been ruled out on financial grounds,  first of all as a result of the Geddes economies and then of the extremely close paring of all expenditure since the financial crisis of 1931, and the over-riding demand for the building of additional quarters for married men left little money available for single men&apos;s quarters.. It can hardly be disputed that policemen, whose duties necessarily entail long periods of exposure in all weathers, day and night, have the strongest possible claim to a reasonable standard of comfort off duty.     Under present conditions the standard is, in my opinion,  definitely too low, and it is clearly
a bad state of affairs and extremely detrimental to the efficiency of the Force that the Section Houses should be so unattractive and uncomfortable.     It is therefore urgently necessary to find ways and means of bettering the position.     Progress must of necessity be gradual.     What is required is a definite programme of development which must be carefully prepared and adhered to. Such a programme is now being drafted, but cannot be quickly settled, as there are many questions to be gone into, such as the location of new Section Houses, the disposal of existing ones and what can be done to improve those that are to be kept.     Many are in the only suitable or practicable positions and can be brought up to modern standards;    others are badly placed or too antiquated to be capable of adaptation.     All these matters will take time to consider and work out, but meanwhile I am proposing to you that two modern up-to-date Section Houses, each equipped with a restaurant instead of the present messing and canteen arrangements, should be provided at an early date - one on the north and the other on the south of the Thames.     I hope, however,  to present the whole scheme by the end of the year.      The expenditure involved will,  of course, be considerable, but it will be spread over a number of years.At the same time I am taking steps to review the situation as regards the improvement of those Section Houses which cannot in any circumstances be rebuilt or replaced for a number of years.The question of married quarters, although important,  is not now as urgent as that of Section Houses.     Work has been started on the erection of another large block in Chelsea and when that is completed about 500 of the 800 sets of quarters which Lord Onslow&apos;s Committee recommended in 1920 should be provided for the inner Divisions, will have been built.     But in my opinion the need for married quarters in the inner Divisions will not have been met until 1,000 sets have been provided,  i.e., 200 more than were recommended by the Onslow Committee.     Some of the existing married quarters at old stations are as out-of-date as the Section Houses and will have to be reconstructed or replaced as opportunity offers.
APPENDIX     II. EXTENSION OF NEW SCOTLAND YARD. Memorandum by the Commissioner of Police.The question of accommodation at Scotland Yard, which I have mentioned in my last two Annual Reports, is causing me much concern, and after considering the matter carefully I find it necessary to say that unless the scheme which I am now proposing for extending Scotland Yard to the North can he accepted and put through, the Government will have to consider moving the Headquarters of the Metropolitan Police to a new site altogether.So much has already been said and written about the state of congestion that exists,  that it is not perhaps necessary at this stage to elaborate the point.There is not the smallest doubt in my mind that the efficiency of the Force is suffering from the present conditions work is impeded and delayed;    development (which must inevitably continue) is hampered at every turn, and members of the staff are required to carry out their duties in conditions which are bad for health and eyesight and not conducive either to contentment or efficiency.It is no exaggeration to say that there is hardly any large capital in the world which does not provide its police administration with more spacious and up-to-date accommodation than London.     The accommodation occupied by the various branches of the C.I.D. in Vienna is as large as or larger than the whole of Scotland Yard.The limit has now been reached of what can be done by converting corridors into rooms and crowding men together in offices, and I have already been compelled to take over two floors of the Cannon Row Section House.     It would in my view
be a dangerous and highly undesirable move to abolish the Section House altogether, but I am at this moment faced with a proposal that this should be done.Even if it were done, the additional space so provided would only postpone the problem for a few months.The reasons for the steady increase in the demands for space at Headquarters - which has been going on for many years -are perhaps fairly obvious.      A few of the most important of these reasons may,  however, be mentioned.(l) The Traffic Department.     With the continual piling up of legislation and regulations dealing with traffic and accidents in London,  the duties of the police become steadily more complicated and require more and more supervision from Headquarters .     The Department has been growing for years and there seems every reason to anticipate that this growth will continue .(2) Einger Prints and Criminal Records.      The efficiency of these branches varies with the number and completeness of their records.      To discharge their functions properly they must continually add to their collection of records and devise nev/ methods of identification.      The inevitable result is a steady increase in personnel and the amount of space occupied.(3) Supervision generally.      As you are aware,  I have found it necessary to strengthen supervision in various directions, not only in the interests of efficiency but also as the only means of avoiding large additions to the strength of the Eorce itself.     Accommodation ha3 to be provided for the additional officers appointed and also for proportionate increases in the clerical,  typing,  etc. branches.Many other examples could be given, but what has been said may suffice to explain the tendency of the Headquarters staff to grow steadily.      There is every indication that the
same tendency may continue in the future.In view of all these considerations, the question of expansion has &quot;been repeatedly examined during the last few . years.      There is only one possible direction in which it can be adequately provided for, and that is on the North side of the present buildings.      Immediately North of the Scotland Yard buildings, between the eastern end of Richmond Terrace and the River, there is a piece of land owned by the Commissioners of Crown lands, leased to the Office of Works and at present occupied by a temporary Ministry of Labour bungalow.If this piece of land could be acquired by the Receiver, either by purchase or on long lease, and a building of similar height to the Scotland Yard building could be erected on it, the problem would be solved, at any rate for a number of years.&apos;It has been ascertained that the Office of Works would raise no objection, and it is understood that the Commissioners of Crown Lands would be prepared to fall in with any arrangement that might be made.
