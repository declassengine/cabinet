[THIS DOCUMENT IS TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJBS TY&apos; S government^IENT ).COPY NO. SECRETCP.    210 (54) .CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation by the Government of India,    dated 15th August, 1934.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated 15th August 1934, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.Interest during the last month has centred in the meeting of the Congress Working Committee and the Congress Parliamentary Board at Benares at the end of July.    Malaviya and Aney have resigned from the Parliamentary Board over the question of the communal award, and have decided to start a nationalist party which will work with Congress,  e::cept in so far as the award is concerned, .   ilembership of this party is, however, open to all who are opposed to the communal award, and is not confined to members of Congress.    It is too eo.rly to judge the full effect of this split in the Congress camp or to anticipate any forecast of the result of the general election which it has now been decided will be held in the second week of November.In many provinces there are growing signs of a dispute between the various sections of Congress.    In the Punjab, that Mr. Gandhi failed to achieve the one result that the Punjab Congress had hoped for from his visit to Lahore, namely the reconciliation of the quarrelling sections, was signally proved by the disgraceful scenes which occurred at the Congress Committee elections at Lahore and xumritsar shortly after his visit.    In the Central Provinces feeling over the Congress Committee elections was so high that the meetings ended in disorder and the elections have been held up.    In the United Provinces there are disputes between two factions at Allahabad, while at Benares the elections have led to a division of Congress supporters into three factions, the Parliamentary, the Socialist and the Fascist.-In Bengal, Congress has for long been divided into two parties and Mr. Gandhi does not appear to.have succeeded in bringing them together and has now left the task to Mr. Aney.
2.Mr. Gandhi&apos;s own actions and intentions are still uncertain and he did not revee.l them at Benares.    There is no doubt, however, that his supporters recognise that he alone can keep Congress united,  or rather can prevent the split in Congress ranks becoming more marked, and are pressing him not to court imprisonment, at least till after the Bombay Session of Congress in October.During the current session of the Legislative Assembly a Bill to supplement the Act recently passed by the Bengal Legislature (vide third appreciation of 1934) and to place permanently on the Statute Book the power of transferring terrorists to detention camps outside Bengal, provoked a good deal of discussion but was carried by a substantial majority; those members who opposed it were no doubt anxious to show to their constituents that they had opposed a &quot;repressive&quot; measure.The Temple Entry Disabilities Removal Bill has not yet come on for discussionj    a vast mass of opinions has been received the great majority of which are strongly against the Bill.    So strong are the feelings of the orthodox on this subject that several Local Governments anticipate that if the Bill becomes law its application will lead to serious breaches of the public peace.    Of the Depressed Classes only a small minority seem in favour of the Bill, the majority are either indifferent or suspicious of the intentions of the promoters of the Bill; they prefer more practical measures for the improvement of their social and economic position.
