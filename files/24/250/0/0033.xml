THIS D0CUI&apos;LLNT..1S TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JLSTY. 1 S government.BT     * CABINET.208(34).Housing; policy memorandum by the Minister of Health.There is a matter affecting negotiations with the Housing authorities on the new Housing Bill about which I should be glad to have the decision of my colleagues before the Recess.The Housing Policy Committee of Cabinet made the following recommendations, amongst others,  in its report (CP.46  (34)) .&quot;That as regards &quot;overcrowding and redevelopment&quot; the offer of financial assistance from the Exchequer should be strictly limited to cases where the rehousing is effected on or near the central site by means of blocks of flats and should not be given in cases where the rehousing is effected by means of ordinary small houses erected on undeveloped land on the outskirts of the area of the local authority&quot;.Discussions with the L.C.C. and the representative Associations of Local Authorities have been proceeding,  ^nd it will shortly be necessary to state the Government&apos;s final intentions.The Local Authorities claim that all dwellings provided under the Bill to accommodate the overcrowded, should receive the same subsidy as is provided for slum clearance,  that is in the ordinary case  11. 5s. Gd. per house,  per annum, for 40 years.  ( 17. 10s. Od. per flat on expensive sites).      They claim this both for flats to be built on central sites,  and for cottages to be built on cheaper sites.       This claim can not,  of course, be entertained.Copy No.
id5Such a subsidy is larger tha.n is necessary,  particularly for the cottages on the outskirts.The claim to which the Local Authorities adhere with particular tenacity is that there should be financial assistance for rehousing in cotta.ges, and in my view the claim is a good one, for some assistance in specia,! cases.It is the fact that there will be cases, particularly in the towns of the smaller or middle size in which a measure of cottage-buildirig on the outskirts will be a reasonable part of a comprehensive scheme for dealing with overcrowding.There are a good number of cases where a dwelling of the standard size,   (760 square feet) to be let at 10/-(7/- rent and 3/- rates) can now be &quot;built by the Local Authorities,on an economic basis, and no subsidy is justified.       But some cases may be expected to occur in which cottage-building on the outskirts can not be provided at the required rents on an economic basis,  either because a. large proportion of big families will require an exceptional proportion of houses in excess of the standard size,  or because the local building-costs are high,  or because the means of a larger proportion than usual of the families to be dealt with require rents lower than the 10/-.       Were our proposals to make no provision for such cases, they would be open to the criticism that they imposed upon the Housing Authorities in these cases a task which is impossible, and that they were impracticable and must be ineffective.My proposal is to deal with the matter on the following basis.
July 27th,  1934.That no general subsidy will be given for cottage building.That in the special    cases referred to,  it will be open to the authority in respect of a, particular scheme,  to produce evidence that,  for such reasons as those stated, a subsidy is necessary.     It would then be for the Minister to decide,   subject to Treasury approval as to conditions whether the claim had been made out or not,  and to allow subsidy if necessary,  subject to a reasonable maximum, and to a rate contribution.This proposal involves some relaxation of the limitation recommended by the  Cabinet Committee.      But unless the case of the Local Authorities,  in so far as it is reasonable, be met in some such way, there is in my opinion no prospect of any measure of agreement with them. They will    both oppose the Bill during its passage and give it the cold shoulder when it is passed.    The proposals made will,  I believe, be ultimately acceptable to all reasonable people in the representative Associations, and will make all the difference to the working of the Bill when passed.I have consulted the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the matter, and he agrees with me that the situation should be dealt with in this manner.The matter should properly have been referred to the Cabinet Committee before coming to the Cabinet,  but in view of the nearness of the Recess,  after consultation with the Lord President,  it seemed that it was not improper to bring it direct to the Cabinet.(INTLB.)
