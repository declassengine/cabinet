SURVEY OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION, JULY 1934.Part 1. Summary of recent economic events.STERLING appreciated slightly in relation to gold currencies in the second half of March and the first half of April. Since then, however, it has weakened, and the dollar rate declined from 5-16 on the 12th April to 5-03 on the 5th June. During the month of June it remained steady between 5-03 and 5 - 06. This weakness was attributed mainly to ordinary commercial transactions, but there was said to have been some withdrawal of funds from London, encouraged by greater confidence in the franc, and by the disclosure in the report of the Bank for International Settlements that London&apos;s short-term commitments (calculated in sterling) had increased to the 1930 level. In table 1 are given the average monthly rates of exhange between London and New York and London and Paris since the beginning of 1933, and in table 2 the exchange rates and the price of gold at weekly intervals since the beginning of April 1934.Table 1.Average monthly rates of exchange in 1933 and 1934.New York.

2. It will be observed (table 2) that throughout April, May, and June the price of gold has been below that indicated by the exchange rates. In spite of this, there has been during this period a considerable net import of gold, which presumably represents additions to gold hoarded in London and must not be taken as having the significance attaching to gold imports in normal.3. The Bank of France has increased its holding of gold by about h\ milliard francs since the beginning of March, and now holds more than before the February drain. The exports of gold from this country to France from the middle of April to the end of May amounted to  10,500,000, or about 800,000,000 francs, and only account for part of the increase in the Bank of France&apos;s holdings of gold. In addition, this has been increased by gold lost by other central banks, particularly those of Switzerland, Germany and Italy, and probably by the return to the Bank of France of gold held in France (table 3). The gold holdings of certain central banks since March 1934 are given in the following table. Practically all the gold exported from this country in June was taken by the United States.Table 3.Gold holdings of certain central hanks.(000,000&apos;s omitted.)&apos;Currency.	Bank of Prance.

Considerable exchange difficulties have been experienced both by Germany and Italy. Both marks and lire are quoted appreciably below their parities with gold currencies. There is some expectation that Germany will be forced to devalue the mark. In both countries the restrictions on the sale of domestic currency have been extended.5. At the beginning of April an issue of  150 millions of a new 3 per cent. Funding Loan was announced, of which  105 millions was used to repay the Bond Issue then due and the remainder to reduce the floating debt. The effect of this issue, following on the conversion operation of last autumn, has been to continue the gradual reduction of the floating debt. There has not yet been any decline in the rate of discount at which Treasury bills have been issued. The effect of the contraction of the floating debt upon the assets of the clearing banks may be seen from the following table (table 4).

It may be seen that during 1933 the reduction in discounts was offset by a corresponding increase in investments. In 1934, however, investments have been decreased at the same time as discounts, and consequently, in spite -of a small increase in advances and excessive reserves of cash, deposits are lower than last year.7. Commodity prices in the principal countries have shown the following movements since the beginning of 1933.Table 5.Wholesale commodity prices.--	Great Britain. (Board of Trade.)		United States.

The price of wool has shown a tendency to decline in the absence of the anticipated increase in German demand, as the result of a general slowing down of demand elsewhere.8.

The Board of Trade&apos;s index of industrial production for the first quarter of 1934 has risen to 109 (base 1924 = 100) as compared with 105-0 in the last, and 94-8 in the first quarter of 1933, and is now within reach of the figure for the corresponding quarter of 1929, namely, 110-6.More recent movements have been as follows : Table 6.Wholesale commodity prices in recent weeks.
10. Building plans approved by 146 local authorities (not including the London County Council) during the first quarter of the year amounted to  23-5 millions, an increase of 19-8 per cent, compared with 1933. In April the building plans approved by 142 local authorities were estimated to cost 27-6 per cent, and in May 3-5 per cent, more than those approved in the corresponding months of 1933. The output of steel in the United Kingdom was 834-5 thousand tons in March, 716-8 thousand tons in April and 780 thousand tons in May compared with 577-7, 509-6 and 599-6 thousand tons in the corresponding months last year. Employment in iron and steel manufacturing industries increased slightly both in April and May.11. Retail trade in April and March was affected by the incidence of Easter. In the two months together, the money value of retail trade showed an increase of 1 - 3 per cent, in 1934 compared with 1933. In May there was an increase of 7-7 per cent. The following table (table 8) gives the average daily value of retail sales by months since 1932.Table 8.The average daily value of the retail sales in Great Britain which were reported&apos; to the Bank of England.January...FebruaryMarch   .april may june july august ..

The prices of industrial stocks and shares have recently shown a slight decline following a steady rise.

There has been some uncertainty as to the future course of business activity in America. Security prices have been depressed partly in anticipation of the legislation which has now been passed to control the activities of stock exchange members and to require minimum margins from speculators, and partly
because of the growing threat of labour disputes. The behaviour of security-prices since the beginning of March is illustrated by the following table (table 10).Table 10.Security prices in the United States (Dotu Jones index).March   1 March   8 March 15 March 22 March 29 April   5 April 12 April 19 April 26 May   3 May 10 May 17 May 24 May 31 J une   7 June 14 June 21 June 28 July 5The level of business activity has also shown a- moderate decline.

Efforts have been made to meet the French budget deficit by considerable reductions in expenditure, which appear for the moment to have been accepted by those who suffered from them. These efforts, however, appear to have been only partially successful. As a result the internal financial tension has been to a large degree relaxed. There has been a substantial rise in the price of French government securities. The price of 3 per cent, rentes, the average of which was only 66 in March, has risen to 77. The rate paid by the Treasury for short-term borrowing has also been reduced. The rate on treasury bonds is now 2 per cent, after having been 3 per cent., and that on national defence bonds is now 3 per cent, after having been 4 per cent. The Bank of France has reduced its discount rate from 3 to 1\ per cent.17. On the other hand, the industrial situation continues unsatisfactory. The index of production fell from 105 in February to 104 in March, 103 in April, and to 101 in May. In March 1933 it was 105, in April 107, and in May 109. Other statistics including those of employment and unemployment (table 14) also suggest that the level of business activity is rather less than last year.Table 14.Employment and unemployment in France.

The German situation shows evidence, on the one hand, of a considerable increase in production, accompanied by growing anticipation of difficulties ahead, and, on the other hand, of a serious deterioration in the balance of payments position, which has made it difficult for her to meet her external obligations while maintaining the system of subsidising exports by allowing exporters to employ foreign exchange for the purchase of German loans held abroad. The German Government have also placed further drastic restrictions on imports. The German statistics of employment and unemployment suggest that there has been some further improvement since the end of February, beyond the normal seasonal improvement.   The two sets of figures are, however, to some extent in conflict.Table 16.Employment and unemployment in Germany in the first four months of1933 and 1934.(in thousands.)Numbers employed according to the sickness insurance statistics.Numbers of registered unemployed.	1933.	1934.

The production of iron and steel is still increasing (table 19). There has apparently been no increase in stocks. The increased consumption is largely explained by the putting in hand of projects held in abeyance during the depression.Table 19.Iron and steel production in Germany during the first joxir months of1933 and 1934.(in thousands of metric tons.)Iron.

The scale of these imports has probably been affected by expenditure on armaments and is sufficient to account for some part of Germany&apos;s difficulty in meeting her foreign obligations.Table 20.Imports of certain metals into Germany in the first five months of1932, 1933 and 1934.(in metric tons.)	1932.	1933.	1934.Copper	45,491	54,238	106,604Tin   ......	5,141	5,437	6,626Lead ...	23,276	12,143	32,049Spelter	50,826	34,933	67.219Aluminium ...	13	95	354Nickel	875	1,646	2,85223.

Part 2. The present economic situation.29. Though the domestic situation has certainly not developed in the last three months in a direction which gives ground for fresh anxiety, the pace at which progress has been made has perhaps shown some tendency to slacken as a stage in recovery has been reached at which further improvement meets with increasingly severe resistance. Employment, after the normal seasonal setback experienced in January, has expanded steadily every month at a greater rate than can be attributed to the seasonal spring improvement, with the result that in May approximately 100,000 more insured persons were employed than would have been the case had business activity remained at the level which obtained in December and January last.30. This improvement has been widely spread, and is to some extent apparent in the occupations which are directly affected by consumers&apos; demand, and more markedly in those which are subject to more speculative influences, and in those dependent on the demand for capital goods. There appears at present to be no sign of slackening in the production of the latter. Steel production in April and May, though not quite at the level of March, was very satisfactory. Employment in the engineering and shipbuilding industries shews improvement. The cost of building plans passed by local authorities continues to be well in advance of last year&apos;s figure, and there is thus no reason to anticipate any curtailment of activity in the building industry in the near future. The evidence indicates that the expansion of retail demand has been less continuous, but in this direction also there are signs of improvement. Though the index of retail trade in March and April did not shew the same increase over last year as was shewn in December and January, sales in May appeal&apos; to have been very satisfactory; and there has been a rather greater increase in employment in the occupations dependent on retail demand such as distribution, restaurant and hotel keeping and entertainments than can be accounted for by seasonal factors. There thus appears to have been an encouraging increase in expenditure on the part of the public, and it is from this quarter, failing any expansion of the export trade, that a furthur stimulus to greater business activity must be expected. Slightly disturbing features are a small decline in the level of wholesale prices since February, and a reaction in the price of industrial securities in the second part of May, in which American selling may have played a part.31.   On balance there appears to have been some steady progress in the internal economic situation of this country during the last few months.   In view of the uncertainties of the international situation this is perhaps a satisfactory conclusion.   Though the influences which have prevented a more rapid advance are, no doubt, international in character, there is one purely domestic factor which may conceivably have had some adverse effects, namely, the decline which has recently taken place in the volume of bank deposits.   The deposits of the London clearing banks for May show a decline of  86 millions (or over 4 per cent.) in comparison with May of last year, whereas during the same period their holdings of cash show an increase of about  12 millions (or approximately 6 per cent.). The decline in the deposits has been brought about mainly by the reduction in the amount of the discounts held by the banks.    This, in turn, is due to the Treasury&apos;s funding operation, which has led to a reduction in the size of the floating debt.    The banks did not utilise their increased holdings of cash to expand their deposits by large purchases of investments, but, as we have already mentioned, their deposits actually declined by  86 millions, although compared with a year ago there was a small increase of  11 millions (or 2-1 per cent.) in their investments.   The banks&apos; unwillingness to make further heavy purchases of investments may probably be explained by a shortage of compara-tively short-dated government securities, a shortage accentuated by recent conversion operations of the Treasury, and by the risks attaching to the holding of longer dated securities in view of the possibility that interest rates may have risen by the time that the securities come to be disposed of.   The reduction in deposits means simply that in the aggregate the public have slightly smaller liquid resources whether for current or capital expenditure or for investment on the Stock Exchange, and this may have a slightly adverse effect on the prices of goods and securities.   But two things must be remembered, first, while
the total supply of government securities has been considerably increased by the Treasury&apos;s operations in funding part of the floating debt, the banks have only bought a further  11 millions of investments. The public must, therefore, have absorbed a very considerable amount of government securities during the year. Secondly, when the banks bought such large amounts of investments during 1932/33 the public sold an equal amount, partly in order to increase their liquidity, partly to take the handsome profit the great rise in prices provided. Quite a large proportion of the great increase in deposits during 1932/33 must, therefore, have been looked upon by the depositors as capital in the form of cash awaiting reinvestment. During the past year, they have probably discovered that their liquid resources are more than ample. They have accordingly invested part of them in the government securities that have been issued to reduce the floating debt, the natural result being a fall in the deposits of the clearing banks. That the liquid resources of the public are really ample for the present needs may be inferred from the continuance of the extremely low levels of money rates and of the amounts of bank advances. Whilst it is unsafe to assume any change in general banking policy from a single month&apos;s movements, it is interesting to note that the June aggregate of investments for the eight clearing banks that have so far published their statements shows an increase of  4 million over the corresponding total for the previous month.32. These, however, are not factors of the first importance. The develop-ment of the international situation is likely to dominate the prospects in this country for some time. So far British foreign trade has suffered less than might have been anticipated from the depreciation of the dollar, though it must be remembered that current exports always reflect the situation existing several months previously. British exports for the first five months of this year exceed those for the same period of 1933 by  11 million or 7 per cent, an increase which appears to be almost entirely accounted for by an increase in volume. In part this has been due to an expansion of trade with markets which are protected either by the Ottawa Agreement or by trade agreements, and which are not therefore subject to the full force of foreign competition, an expansion which has been made possible by the improving internal situation in these countries, e.g., in Canada and South Africa. But the fall in the value of sterling in relation to the currencies of the gold bloc has also been of great importance. For these countries, with Germany, are our main competitors in many staple lines of manufactured goods.33. British imports, on the other hand, have increased in a larger proportion, imports for the first five months being  34 million or 13 per cent, greater than in 1933, with the result that, allowing for the increase which has occurred in re-exports of imported goods, the visible adverse balance of trade has increased by nearly  19 million. As British industrial production has increased in the same period by 15 per cent, in volume and the prices of imported goods by 3 per cent., there is no prima facie case for suggesting that British industry and agriculture are obtaining a smaller share in the home market than they were year ago. Indeed, if anything, it suggests the reverse. But the fact that tli competitive position of British producers in the home market has not deteriorated does not mean that this increase in imports is of no significance. There is no serious danger that this increase may be carried to sufficient lengths to affect the financial situation in this country by creating serious difficulties in meeting-demands for foreign exchange. The financial position of this country is affected not by the visible adverse balance of trade, but by the balance of payments of all kinds. The latter has certainly not moved against this country to the same extent as the former. For example, of the increase in the visible adverse balance of trade of  19 million, approximately  4 million is accounted for by increases in imports of tea, rubber and tin, commodities which are mainly produced by companies owned in Great Britain, whose increased receipts will be reflected in increased dividend payments to this country. There has also probably been some improvement in the receipts from shipping services, and from financial services as a result of increased activity generally. In these circumstances it is by no means certain that the balance of payments is moving against this country. But even if it is, there is no reason to anticipate any serious consequences. A considerable part of the increase in the adverse balance of trade is accounted [10298] d
for by increased adverse balances with the dominions and colonies. But an increase in the cash claims of British Empire countries on Great Britain does not of itself necessarily or directly affect the rates of exchange between Great Britain and foreign countries. For most of the dominions naturally prefer to hold any increase in their overseas assets in London rather than in a foreign centre. Again the increased claims on London secured by foreign countries which have had difficulty in meeting their obligations abroad will be used to some extent to meet their short-term debts to London, or in paying interest on loans made by residents in Great Britain. Finally, quite a small depreciation of sterling relative to the gold currencies would probably suffice to bring about a speculative support of sterling, and would improve, to the extent to which the depreciation was maintained, the competitive position of British producers.34. An increase in imports unaccompanied by a corresponding increase in exports and the other classes of income earned abroad by residents in Great Britain may be an indication of a tendency which may have an important reaction on the domestic situation. The possibilities of recovery in this country are limited not only by the internal situation here, but also by the extent to which recovery proceeds in the rest of the world. Up to a point it may be feasible to enjoy an improvement in internal activity independently of the extent to which the rest of the world is suffering from depression. But as internal improvement outstrips that which is experienced by the world as a whole, it is likely to meet with increasing resistance. The part of the demand for British goods and services which arises from the outlay of residents in this country is likely to increase proportionately with an increase in British incomes and British production; but the remainder which is dependent on foreign demand is determined by the incomes enjoyed by foreigners. It does not, of course, follow from this that the pace of recovery here must inevitably be uniform with that prevailing in the rest of the world. For, in the first place, current expenditure in this country, whether for consumption or for investment, is not rigidly linked to current income. In favourable monetary circumstances the total expenditure of British residents may increase faster than British incomes. Again, if the competitive position of British industry improves, the share of the total British expenditure which is devoted to the purchase of British goods may be expanded at the expense of the share devoted to the purchase of foreign goods. In either case, the deficiency of foreign demand may be made good, and the balance between the supply and demand for British goods and services preserved. But it obviously becomes increasingly difficult to expand the demand for British goods in either of these ways as the divergence between the level of production in this country and abroad increases, and an increasingly adverse balance of payments would be the measure of this difficulty. So far the unresponsiveness of foreign demand to increased imports into this country has, perhaps, only had the effect of preventing demand in this country from feeling the full effect of the stimulus which the revival of capital expenditure might have been expected to produce. A substantial part of the increase in imports has been brought about by the importation of goods, such as certain classes of iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, timber and machinery, necessary to the production of capital goods. A large part of the remainder has arisen from the increased demand for raw materials in the preliminary stage of manufacture which has accompanied the building up of stocks made desirable by the increase in activity generally.35. The future course of activity in this country is thus very much bound up with the development of the international situation. The recent course of events in this field may be briefly summarised as follows. The revival in American activity which was in progress this spring seems to have reached its highest point at the end of April or the beginning of May. Since then there has been a distinct recession, which is likely to continue for several months. The main grounds for this expectation are, first, the compulsory restriction of production m the cotton manufacturing industry; secondly, the probability that there will be a reaction in the steel trade in the third quarter of the year, when price increases already announced come into effect, as demand has hitherto been stimulated both by the desire to build up stocks before prices rose, and by the possibility of labour disputes; thirdly, a growing resistance on the part of consumers to higher prices.  These expectations may very well prove well founded;
though there should be a recovery somewhat later in the year. The final passing of the Stock Exchange Control Act, and the modification it contains of the most onerous provisions of the Securities Act, should lead to some revival of capital issues and expenditure, which should have favourable reactions on the general situation. But before actual capital expenditure is likely to benefit from greater activity in the new issue market, the refunding issues which will become possible will first have to be disposed of. In any event, there is some possibility that the gradual increase in American prices which has been taking place under the influence of the industrial and agricultural legislation of last year may be checked as a result of the modification of the administration^ policy in this direction. The present level of prices has been maintained without much change since February of this year, and there is, perhaps, little prospect of any substantial rise for the next few months.36. In France there has been a considerable improvement in financial confidence, largely as a result of the efforts to balance the budget, which has led to a repatriation of funds from abroad, an increase in the gold holdings of the Bank of France, a decline in rates of interest and a rise in the price of government securities. At the same time, the industrial reaction has continued. Production has fallen to a point below that prevailing last year; employment and foreign trade are diminishing. There is no evidence of improvement in the political situation. In Italy there is a serious shortage of foreign exchange, which is being accentuated by a growingly adverse balance of trade. Steps have been taken by the government to bring about a reduction of prices, including a reduction of the salaries of its own employees and a reduction of rents. So far, however, these steps do not appear to have had much effect.37. In Germany the exchange difficulties have reached an acute stage. The allowances of exchange for imports have been drastically reduced, and the general default on the interest payments on long- and medium-term debts is a further indication of the shortage of foreign exchange. The causes of this exchange crisis are numerous. The export surpluses of 1930, 1931 and 1932 had in part been achieved by the reduction in working capital made possible by the severe restriction of output which took place in those years. In 1933 the policy of restriction was abandoned for one of vigorous internal expansion and, as output increased, there was naturally a demand for raw materials to replace the consequent shortage of working capital.. But, in the meantime, the outlets for German foreign trade had been reduced by a number of events outside her control, by the depreciation of sterling and the tariffs placed upon the import of goods into this country, by the diversion of Scandinavian trade to this country, by the reduction in the purchases of the Soviet Union, and by the general paralysis of trade in central Europe. The inevitable difficulties of this transition would no doubt have been lessened if an internal stimulus had been sought through the devaluation of the German currency rather than through the extension of internal capital enterprise, whatever other difficulties this course might have created.38. The main features of the world situation are, on the one hand, a general improvement in the position of the countries producing primary commodities, which have, by the depreciation of their currencies, by restriction of output, or by the reduction of their external obligations, improved their external position at a time when an expansion in the consumption of raw materials in the industrial countries is taking place; and, on the other hand, an extreme diversity of fortune in the principal industrial countries. One group of industrial countries, namely, the United Kingdom, the United States, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and Japan, as a result of the depreciation of their currencies, have been able to pursue an expansionist policy with comparative success, whether on orthodox lines, as in this country, or on extremely unorthodox lines as in the United States. Germany has pursued an expansionist policy in circumstances which have exposed her creditors to serious dangers in relation to her foreign exchange position. In France and the other countries of the gold bloc the expansion of production. is being prevented by the desire to maintain an unchanged parity in relation to gold, which to-day entails unduly high exchange rates relative to other countries.39. It is arguable whether on balance the group of countries with depreciated currencies are benefiting by the relative over-valuation of the
currencies of the gold bloc. For the balance of trade of the gold bloc countries is at the moment more favourable than last year, as a reduction of purchases abroad brought about by the decline in internal activity and increased protection more than equals their losses in foreign markets. The position of Great Britain, how-ever, has this special feature. The depreciation of the dollar has effectively curtailed the expansion of British foreign trade in classes of goods such as motor cars, which present the most favourable opportunities of permanent expansion. At the same time Japan, assisted by the depreciation of the yen, is making increasing inroads into the markets previously supplied by our staple exporting industries. Exports from this country are only maintained by the competitive advantage which we now enjoy relative to the older industrial countries of Europe. Any sudden loss of this advantage, unaccompanied by improvement in other directions, would consequently have serious repercussions.40. The most favourable course which events might take would be, on the one hand, a gradual increase in the purchases of industrial goods by the countries which produce raw materials, and, on the other hand, a continuous rise in the level of American costs which would permit some gain by Great Britain in markets at present dominated by America. The obstacles to such a development are, first, the danger that in the absence of a recovery in the demand for capital goods by industry in America, the recovery there may be unduly delayed; secondly, the possibility that the position of countries producing primary commodities will suffer from a recession of activity in Germany; and, thirdly, the fact that currencies in some of the dominions and other countries producing primary commodities are to some extent under-valued and that the normal course of governmental capital expenditure in those countries is blocked by financial difficulties.41. If events do not take the more favourable course referred to in the last paragraph, there is an obvious risk that growing internal discontent will compel a radical change of policy in the gold bloc countries. If this merely takes the form of an abandonment of deflationary activity and an encouragement of internal expenditure by the governments concerned, this would be wholly beneficial to this country. And it is possible that, in view of the large reserves of gold which they hold, they might pursue this policy long enough to permit the necessary adjust-ments to be made elsewhere without abandoning the present exchange values. If, however, the present exchange values are abandoned, the immediate effect will almost certainly be a reduction of exports from this country upon a scale sufficient to bring about some decline in the level of general activity, though the ultimate effect might be to put an end to the deflationary trend in world events.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, July 20, 1934.o
