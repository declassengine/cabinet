SECRET.CP.  202 (54).COPY NO.0 A B I N E T. COLONIAL GOVERNORS1  PENSIONS. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I have now seen the further memorandum CP.  186 (34) circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the subject of Colonial Governors&apos;  pensions. 2. I consider that, from the Dominions Office pointof view, the modified proposals now submitted on behalf of the Colonial Office and agreed to by the other Departments concerned are satisfactory.    The proposal now is, in short, that in the case of a &quot;Civil Service&quot; Governor, the period of Governor&apos;s service qualifying for Governor&apos;s pension should be reduced from 10 years to three years. 3. In the case of the posts of the Governor ofSouthern Rhodesia, the Governor Newfoundland, and the High Commissioner for South Africa (for which &quot;Civil Service&quot; Governors may well be required in future)  the proposal should be helpful as widening the field of choice. 4i In the case of the Australian States -(l)    &quot;Civil Service&quot; Governors are not in the nature of things likely to be appointed to any considerable extent; but    (2)    if a case should arise, there is no reason to anticipate difficulty, from the point of view of public opinion in the State, to the period of three years&apos;&apos; service as Governor of the State qualifying for pension; the previous &quot;Civil Service&quot; of the individual would actually be the determining factor.(Intld.)
