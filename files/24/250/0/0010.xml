THE NEED FOR IMPROVED NUTRITION OF THE PEOPLE OF GREAT BRITAIN.I. Introductory.In recent months we have devoted a considerable amount of time and thought to the need for improving the general standard of nutrition of the people of this country.&quot; There is evidence from various sources that the state of health and the physical well-being of the people are far from satisfactory, and that in large measure this is due to preventable causes. At the present time great efforts are being made to ensure the best development of the human mind by means of education, and it is strange, therefore, that little or nothing is being done to ensure the proper development of the human body. It is true that in a vague way there is a general belief that, like any other building, the structure of the human body must reflect the kind of material that is put into it, but little action has been taken by government either to tell the people what are the best materials for producing good bodily structure, or to provide facilities to those sections of the community that are unable to procure such materials. Such an omission is all the more striking when we consider how complete in other directions is the vast organisation that has been set up in this country to attend to the health and general welfare of the population, through the public health departments, the hospitals, and the state medical service generally.2. No system of curative medicine as represented by hospitals and panel doctors, can be really effective when it has to deal with a population which is already malformed, under-developed, and diseased. The present situation can, indeed, be compared with that of a manufacturing firm which first turned out shoddy machinery made from poor material and then deliberately set about establishing an elaborate repairing department to patch up, at its own expense, all the defects in the machinery that it has produced. Such a situation is inconceivable in industry and yet this is exactly what is happening to-day as regards the development and health of the people of this country. What is first required in this field is that steps should be taken to build up as fine as possible a set of human beings in the best of health. When this has been done the curative and repairing system, represented by the public health services, would be available to maintain the people&apos;s health at this high level. This is the essential task of preventive medicine at the present time, and until this is realised by those in authority, no remedy will be found for the present deplorable condition of the health of the people of our country.* Disturbing evidence regarding the physical and medical standard of the people is afforded by the percentage of recruits rejected for the army. The following table shows for the period 1923-32 (i) the percentage of recruits rejected on physical or medical grounds and (ii) the percentage of recruits passing physical tests who were subsequently rejected on medical grounds: Year.

They seem, however, to us to be sufficiently striking to deserve serious consideration.
II.-Widespread physical defects of nutritional origin.3. We propose now to refer to a number of physical defects that are widespread among the people in this country and which are due to defective diet.4. Taking as a good indication of physique the height of the average person it may be said that in general this is much less in this country than it should be. This is especially noticeable among the poorer classes and becomes apparent in this stratum of society even in the earlier years of life. In a small comparative survey recently made in Newcastle between the children of labouring and artisan families on the one hand and of professional families on the other, it was found that whereas 25 per cent, of the professional class children were above, and 5 per cent, below the standard heights,* only 2 per cent, of the poorer class were above and 47 per cent, below.5. At a later stage the difference in height often becomes more obvious, and investigation would, we believe, show that the average height of boys in public schools is greater than that of boys attending elementary schools. This under-development, so far as growth is concerned, is mainly nutritional in character. Direct evidence is available to show that it is possible to increase greatly the height of an individual by adding certain foodstuffs to the diet during the period of growth.6. If, however, smallness in stature was the only question at issue, the matter might not be of pressing importance so long as the general standard of health was good. The standard of health, however, is not good. There is still, for instance, in spite of the great efforts made by welfare centres in recent years, a great deal of rickets among the poor in this country, more especially in industrial centres.7. Rickets results primarily in the malformation of the bones. Deformities of the legs and arms are commonly seen. Defects in the formation of the chest are also often produced by this disease, especially since the condition is frequently associated with infective disorders of the chest, such as bronchial pneumonia in childhood. Probably the worst effect of rickets and the greatest cause of further trouble is the malformation of the pelvis in female children. It is notorious that where rickets is common, as in Glasgow, maternal morbidity and mortality associated with childbirth are high. To-day the illnesses of childbirth are generally recognised as being of great importance and ante-natal clinics have been established and other organised attempts made to deal with them. It is surprising there-fore that one of the main underlying causes of the trouble, namely, the presence of rickety malformed pelvises in women, has been left almost untouched. In order to eliminate the commonest cause of malformation of the pelvis in women, an attempt should be made-to ensure that female children during infancy, childhood and adolescence, are so fed that their pelvic structures will be of the best possible formation. This step alone would greatly reduce maternal morbidity associated with parturition. With existing knowledge of the subject of rickets, its continued presence in the community is a severe reflection on public health administration. Rickets will, however, undoubtedly continue as a common disorder until an organised policy of feeding is adopted in this country.8. Associated with defective formation of bones there is also throughout the country a very widespread defect in dental structure accompanied by diminished resistance of teeth to infection. Dental caries is indeed so common now as almost to be regarded as normal. Even in London, where matters are probably better than in many parts of the country, about 70 per cent, of children between five and six years of age in the elementary schools suffer from dental caries.9. Another disease of nutritional origin affecting the dental structure is pyorrhoea.  This disease is widespread, especially among* Tho standard heights for given ages adopted as a measure for the abovo experiments are the average heights ascertained for such ages by the Anthropo-nietric Committee of the Board of Education, and are based on a survey of tho heights of children attending elementary schools in England and Wales.
older people, even those who have escaped dental caries. There is definite evidence that this is a disease of nutritional origin and follows the malformation of the gum epithelium in its developmental stage owing to dietetic defect.10. Yet another nutritional disease of great importance, which is extremely common in this country, is anaemia, especially in children and pregnant and nursing women. This defect, it can be said with assurance, could be practically eliminated by proper feeding. In the Newcastle investigation referred to in paragraph -1 above among professional and working-class children, it was found that of 121 poorer children 28 or 23 per cent, were definitely anaemic (i.e., had haemoglobin readings below 70 per cent.), whereas in the professional class most of the children were above 75 per cent., and none below 70 per cent.11. Again, in a recent survey of the blood condition of child-bearing women in London, anaemia was commonly found, while in the case of their infants, 45 per cent, of the breast-fed and 51 per cent, of the artificially fed infants were definitely anaemic when under 12 months of age.12. Simple goitres are not common nowadays in this country, except in certain areas, but what there are could also be prevented by the introduction of good feeding.18. In addition to these illnesses, which are undoubtedly due to defective nutrition, there are a number of conditions, especially of an infective nature, which probably have a dietetic basis. These include such common disorders as running ears, resulting from infection of the middle ear and often ending in deafness, chronic-infection of the nasal sinuses and the tonsils, eatarrhal conditions of the respiratory tract and other lung diseases, including bronchial pneumonia and tuberculosis. These conditions are all much commoner among the poor, and, though there are undoubtedly other factors than diet involved, there is good ground for the belief that with proper feeding these diseases would be greatly reduced in the community.III. What is wrong with the people&apos;s diet ?14. There are two main defects in the average diet of the people in this country, viz. : (a) the over-consumption of cereals in the form of bread and similar foodstuffs; and(b) the under-consumption of protective foodstuffs, such as milk,cheese, eggs, and vegetables, especially green vegetables.15. Since any one individual can consume only a certain amount of food daily, these two defects are intimately related. It is said that the cereals form at least 60 per cent, of the total food consumed in the country. Their popularity as an article of diet depends largely on economic factors. They are easily produced, stored and transported. They are thus not only cheap, but are one of the easiest types of food to be manipulated by the average housewife. The poorer the individual the greater the proportion does bread form of his whole diet, so that among the poorer classes this article of diet forms a much greater proportion than 60 per cent., the average for the population as a whole. For opposite reasons, the consump-tion of the protective foodstuffs is far too low. They are relatively dear, are often of poor keeping qualities, and, in the case of some of them, difficult to manage as articles of household dietary.16. Again the consumption of liquid milk is lower here than in most countries with a comparable standard of living. Consumption per head probably amounts to between 15 and 18 gallons a year in Great Britain, but is twice that quantity or more in the United States, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland and Holland. The ill-effects of a deficient milk consumption are intensified by the fact that breast-feeding over a proper period is not commonly practised in this country. In early life no other foodstuff can replace milk adequately, and undoubtedly this reason alone accounts for much physical defect and ill-health. In particular, the deficient intake of milk is largely responsible for malformation of bones as is seen in
rickets, and the defective structure of teeth which results in the extensive dental caries found.17. Two other factors tending to make the effects of a relatively deficient intake of milk even more harmful are: (a) the absence of abundant sunshine in this country, and,associated with this, owing to the low temperature, the necessity of completely clothing the body, two conditions which make it impossible for the body to be significantly affected by the ultra-violet light which plays such a large part in bone and teeth formation in the tropics; and(b) the fact that cereals not only do not aid the formation ofbone and teeth, but actually interfere with their calcification, an action which can only be antagonised by a larger consumption of a protective foodstuff such as milk.18. A further action of milk, established by experiment, is to increase the average stature of an individual. Even in institutions where diets have been considered to be good, it has been found that the addition of a pint of milk daily to the normal diet greatly increases the rate of growth and accession of weight as compared with other foodstuffs tested. When, for example, a pint of milk was added daily to the diets of children in a particular institution, the average growth in one year was 2 - 63 inches as compared with 1-84 in the children who did not receive this additional milk. Children who received an addition of sugar, of equivalent caloric value to a point of milk showed a growth of 1-94 inches, an increase of 0-1 inch as compared with the children who received no additional diet. The children who received extra milk put on 6-98 lbs. in the year, the children who received extra sugar 4-93 lbs. and the children who received neither 3-85 lbs. It would seem, therefore, that the deficient intake of milk in early and adolescent life is responsible for both subnormal and abnormal physique, and that increased consumption of this foodstuff would result in a definite increase and improvement in these physical respects.19. Experimental work indicates also that milk increases the resistance to various common types of infection, and although it is difficult to prophesy what an increased consumption of milk would do in this respect, it would probably greatly reduce many common forms of sepsis, especially of the types mentioned in paragraph 13 above.20. The cereals commonly eaten have of course good nutritional qualities, but as a class they are deficient in certain important respects, especially in calcium and fat-soluble vitamins and first-class biological protein. The greater, therefore, the part that they play in the dietary, the greater the probability is it that physical defects and ill-health will follow. This of course does not mean that none of them should be eaten, but rather that their deficiencies should be made up by a greater consumption of the protective foodstuffs mentioned above.21. Realising the great diversity of foodstuffs available, many people have some difficulty in believing that there can be any deficiency of essential chemical elements to those consuming them. If, however, a list is taken of the commonest articles of diet, such as, for instance, bread, oatmeal, rice, sugar, margarine, lard, meat (including beef, mutton, pork), poultry, fish, jam and fruit, there is no doubt that, for a child, this diet, full of variety as it appears, would certainly result in defective formation of bones and teeth, owing to its deficiency in calcium and calcifying qualities. If fish were removed from the list, the diet would also be iodine-deficient, and goitre would develop in the population. If meat were removed or greatly reduced in amount, anaemia would also certainly develop. It is clear, therefore, that the risk of malnutrition and consequently of physical defects is much greater than is commonly supposed.IY. The special feeding requirements of particular classes of thecommunity.22. The considerations which we have urged apply to the whole community, but they do so with special force to certain sections of it.
In the present section we propose to refer briefly to the special feeding requirements of (a) pregnant and nursing women, (b) children, and (c) adults.(a) Preynant and nursing women.28. It may be accepted as a general axiom that the younger the infant the more important is correct feeding for its general health and physical development. Thus an infant in embryo should receive an adequate supply of a large number of essential chemical constituents in its food. Since the nutriment of the foetus depends on the supplies from the mother, the mother herself must be properly fed during pregnancy and lactation. If she is not properly fed, she sacrifices to her offspring her stores of essential substances and may become ill or even die in consequence. If the supplies to the foetus are not adequate, it also will suffer.24. There is reason to believe that a great deal of ill-health in women during and after pregnancy is due to defective nutrition. Yet this is an aspect of ante-natal work to which practically no attention is given.25. The first object to be attained is, therefore, the improvement of the diet throughout the period of growth. This period begins with the pregnant and lactating woman, in order to ensure an adequate supply of all essential substances to her offspring, and continues with the child until adolescence or at least to the school-leaving age.26. Every woman during pregnancy and lactation should include daily in her diet a pint-and-a-half of milk, one or two eggs or their yolks, and a serving of green vegetables. Fish should be taken twice a week. With such a diet it is probable that the general health of women would be greatly improved, that they would have a more abundant supply of milk for breast feeding over a prolonged period, and that the milk secretion would not dry up, as happens so often nowadays, at the end of, say, two or three months. Infants should be completely breast-fed for at least eight months, and after that period partially up to the age of one year.(b) Children.27. After weaning, an infant should be supplied with not less than one pint of milk daily and one egg yolk, up to the end of the first year of life. From this time onwards a pint-and-a-half of milk should be available daily up to the age of twelve years, and afterwards one pint. Cereal preparations should be eliminated for the first eight months of the post-natal life of the infant. After that they should be allowed to play only a very subsidiary part in feeding until the end of the first year. Apart from the milk ration, it is impossible to lay down any rule of dietary after the first year of life, but mothers should realise the necessity of including in the child&apos;s food the protective foodstuffs already mentioned.   Egg-yolk and green vegetables should be given daily.(c) Adidts.28. We have laid the main emphasis on the need for an improve-ment in the diet of early life, as this is the most pressing problem. It is, however, equally certain that great improvement in health would follow the adoption of similar feeding principles by adults, namely, an increased consumption of milk, cheese, eggs, and vegetables. A diet so constituted might be expected to increase the resistance of the individual against many forms of disease.Y. The need for a national food policy.29. The foregoing survey shows how urgent is the need for securing an improvement in the nutrition of the people. In stressing the importance of this question, we do not, however, wish to appear unmindful of what has already been achieved by preventive medicine. During the past sixty or seventy years there has been a great
advance in the general health of the people as the result of public administration. In the main this has been due to a recognition of the need for supplying clean and abundant water, improved sanitation, and non-infected food to the population. These are all matters which have been controlled directly by legislative action. In addition, health has been greatly improved by the improvement in the standard of personal cleanliness which this period has witnessed.80. These changes have resulted in the virtual elimination of such deadly disorders as typhoid, cholera, smallpox, plague, typhus, and epidemic diarrhoea and vomiting in children. With the disappearance of these diseases, infant mortality has diminished greatly, and the expectation of life of the average child has increased. So successful has been this side of health activity that it is to be doubted whether much further improvement can be expected simply by continuing the same line of action. Much is hoped for from the great efforts that are now being made to improve housing conditions, but even here no benefit and even some harm may be done, if as a result of increased rents the poorest classes are forced to spend less on food.81. A general improvement in health has resulted from the developments described above, but notwithstanding this, there remains throughout the country a great deal of subnormal physique and of other forms of ill-health, resulting in much incapacity and disablement. Modern research on nutrition has established clearly that many of those widespread defects could be eliminated by an improvement in the feeding habits of the people. If this fact were once generally recognised, and if action based on that recognition were taken by government, there would, we are convinced, be an improvement in the physique and general health of the people comparable in extent to that which in the nineteenth century followed the introduction of cleanliness and sanitation.82. Already there may be observed a gradual, but increasing recognition of the importance of these questions; and we do not doubt that with the growth of knowledge, new habits of feeding will gradually bring about some transformation in the present picture of public ill-health. Government influence also is already at some points being exerted in this direction, as, for example, in the supply of free meals and milk to certain classes of school children.33. The importance of nutrition is, however, so great that haphazard advance on the present lines is not enough. What is required is the acceptance by the state of a national feeding policy based upon scientific knowledge. A comprehensive policy on these lines would, we are convinced, bring the greatest benefits to all sections of the people, and especially to the poorest classes who to-day suffer most severely from preventable defects in health.84. In speaking of a national feeding policy we have in mind the assumption by the state of a general responsibility for ensuring an adequate standard of nutrition among the people, in the same way that the state has already assumed a general responsibility for education and for the housing of the people. The objects to be aimed at by such a policy are clear; and the benefits that would accrue from it are incalculably great. Very great efforts would, however, be needed to crown this policy with success, as it would involve far-reaching changes in the dietary of the country and in the habits of the people.85. Great advances could, however, be secured if an educational campaign were vigorously prosecuted by the government throughout the country. One of the great difficulties to-day is that the average man is not only ignorant of the modern advances in nutrition and other branches of medical science, but also has practically no means of learning them except through the daily press, a method which for obvious reasons cannot be expected to be effective. Nor is ignorance in these matters confined to the general public. Wide as is the&apos; field covered by medical education, the study of nutrition has hitherto been largely neglected.   As a result, the medical profession[10201] c
as a whole does not attach to nutrition the importance that it deserves. The success likely to be obtained from an educational campaign, even if well organised, would, however, be subject to serious limitations.8(3. In the first place, far too little of the necessary protective foodstuffs (referred to in paragraph 14 above) are at present produced in this country to permit of their being consumed by the people on the necessary scale. It is true that there is to-day a surplus of milk, but increased supplies would be needed before there was sufficient for the population to obtain the daily quantity desired. Cheese, vegetables, and eggs also would be required in quantities far in excess of present production in this country.37. It is clear indeed that without a large increase in imports a considerable expansion would be required both in dairy farming and in market gardening in this country before full effect could be given to the policy we have in mind. The changes in the agriculture of the country would also be far-reaching. Considering, however, that it is impracticable for this country to produce from its own soil more than a part of the food that it consumes, it would be wise to direct our efforts principally to the growth of the protective foodstuffs requiring skilled labour, to which our climate is suited, such as milk, eggs, vegetables, and fruit, rather than of the mere suppliers of energy such as cereals and sugar.38. In the second place it is difficult to conceive that milk, eggs, and vegetables, however cheaply produced and distributed, could be put on sale at prices low enough to enable the poorest classes to buy them in sufficient amounts.39. It is not for us to suggest how difficulties of this kind could be overcome; but we refer to them here as they serve to show that a national feeding policy backed with all the resources of the state is essential if the nutrition of the people is to be organised in the light of modern scientific knowledge.40. We believe that such a policy represents the most important step which the state could take in preventive medicine to-day. Once the main lines of the policy had been settled we do not anticipate that great administrative difficulties would be encountered in putting it into effect, as existing government services would require but little adjustment for the purpose. The ante-natal clinics, the child welfare centres, the school medical service, and the national health insurance system form together a chain of organisations which are both ready and well fitted to carry out any scheme that might be adopted for the improved feeding of the population.41. We do not doubt that within a few years the improved health of the country that would follow would lead to substantial reductions in existing expenditure on curative medicine. In the early years the cost of a national food policy would be offset to the extent of such savings. Ultimately the net expenditure by the state on health services should actually fall as the result of the development of a well-grown and healthy race.42. To sum up, the benefits to the health of the people that we anticipate would follow the adoption of a national food policy are as follows : (a) Benefits which, on the basis of existing scientific knowledge, it appears certain would accrue from a food policy :(i) an increased average stature of the population. It is probable that this might result in an average increase of 2 or 8 inches in the adult;(ii) a great reduction in dental caries, amounting possibly to 60 per cent, or more of the present incidence;(hi) the elimination of rickets and its sequelae;(iv) a great reduction in the incidence of pyorrhoea;(v) the elimination of simple anaemia;(vi) the elimination of simple goitre;(vii) a general increase in the physical activity and the mental alertness of the average individual.
(b) Benefits which would probably but not certainly accrue from a national food policy :*(i) a reduction in middle ear disease with its sequelae of discharging ears and deafness;(ii) a reduction in broncho-pneumonia and bronchitis in early life, and in catarrhal conditions of the respiratory tract;(hi) a reduction in septic tonsils and adenoids and septic nasal sinuses;(iv) a reduction in all forms of tuberculosis;(y) a reduction in acute rheumatism and its disabling result, rheumatic endocarditis, the commonest form of heart disease.YI. Recommendations.48. A far-reaching policy such as we advocate will at the outset necessarily encounter both scepticism and opposition. Indeed at every stage the degree of success attained is likely to be conditioned by the extent to which the policy commands the confidence of the medical profession and public opinion generally. The facts outlined in this report are beyond dispute. But to-day they are known to, and appreciated by, only a small number, even of the educated classes.44. The first step should therefore consist in the preparation under the direction of the government of an authoritative statement of the scientific case which would form the basis for subsequent action. Nor is this the only reason why we think that such a preliminary review is desirable. The policy proposed raises much wider issues than those of public health administration. As we have shown, it would probably entail important changes in agricultural&quot; policy. It would also have important effects on educational methods in this country. From this point of view also, preliminary study is desirable.45. We therefore recommend that, as a first step, the Govern-ment should set up a strong committee of the Economic Advisory Council to examine and report upon the various aspects of our proposals.46. The terms of reference of the committee should, we suggest, be as follows: &quot; to inquire into the part played by defective nutrition in producing a low standard of physique. amongst the population of Great Britain; to report by what changes in diet these defects could be remedied and to suggest measures by which the state could ensure the introduction of such changes; and, in particular, to consider to what extent public policy in regard to public health, education and agriculture would require to be modified to give effect to a national food policy on these lines, and what additional expenditure of public funds would be involved.&quot;(Signed on behalf of the committee): A.
