214DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT. GRET. Copy No.      j ^P. 216(34)CABINET.GERMAN CONTROL OF EXCHANGE AND IMPORTS. Note &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.,1. The Cabinet will wish to &quot;be informed as to recent developments in Germany in connection with the general exchange position and the control of imports.2, The control of exchange which was first put into force by the German   Government in July 1931 has gradually increased in severity so that in recent months the drastic reduction of the sterling allocations available to German importers of United Kingdom goods has caused a virtual cessation of payments due to our producers engaged in the export trade to Germany,,     As a result there is to-day a large sum of outstanding commercial debts due from Germany which is estimated to amount to some  3 millions.     This state of affairs has aroused great resentment, particularly among the suppliers of cotton and woollen yarns.     These have refused to send further supplies to Germany pending a settlement of the outstanding debts.5. Representatives of the Treasury and the Board of Trade went to Berlin in July in an endeavour to reach a settlement of this question of the outstanding commercial debts, and also to make arrangements under which current trade could be carried on.      They were not able to secure any proposals from the German Government In regard to the outstanding debts.     It was, however, clear that if a settlement of the debts was insisted on as a condition for the conclusion of the Agreement,  there would be no Agreement at all.     In the circumstances I felt that it was right to-1-
215secure agreement in regard to current trade and deal subsequently with the question of the debts.     Accordingly the negotiations resulted in the signature of the Anglo-Germun Exchange Agreement of August 10th.4. The Agreement, -which came into force on the 20th August,  enabled German firms purchasing from this country to make payments in reichsmarks into a Special Account opened at the Reiohsbank in the name of the Bank of England who in turn were to dispose of the reichsmarks and credit the British exporters with the sterling proceeds.     The Agreement is on the lines of agreements concluded by Germany with several other countries.      The Agreement received a mixed reception in this country, mainly because it did not touch the question of outstanding debts.      It was also criticised because German exporters and British importers often prefer to do business on a sterling basis,  thus making it difficult to dispose of the reichsmarks in the Special Account.      This criticism has proved well founded as the unsold balance of reichsmarks paid into the Special Account now amounts to more than five millions (the limit set upon the Account in the Agreement) and the Account is,  therefore, at the present moment in suspense.5e Immediately after the Agreement was signed,  a vigorous note on the outstanding debts was presented to the German Government who,  after some delay,  replied to the effect that the question was one for negotiation between the traders concerned;    they added that if the private firms came to an agreement, and that if for the execution of this agreement the co-operation of the German Government was necessary,  the &quot;necessary official decisions would be taken in the effort to settle the arrears as rapidly as possible&quot;*
Lancashire suppliers of cotton yarn had meanwhile sent a delegation to Germany, and received from their German customers proposals for the settlement of the debts which were far from satisfactory and have been rejected.      These provided for the repayment of the debts over a period of twelve month, and the immediate resumption of deliveries of cotton yarn on the basis of six months1 credit.     The traders rejected this offer as they regarded the proposed period of repayment as excessive and objected to giving as much as six months&apos; credit which went considerably beyond the usual trade practice.60 The German Government have now announced thnt as from the 24th September there will be brought into force a new regime for the control of exchange.     The effect of this new system, so far as it is understood, appears to he as follows.     In future a number of &quot;Control Offices&quot; will issue foreign currency certificates in respect of imports.      These certificates together with the necessary Customs certificates will entitle the importer to obtain the foreign exchange to pay for the goods. The existing exchange permits will no longer be valid and the system of allotting foreign currency by the Reichsbank will be abolished,      The import of goods for which a certificate is not issued is not forbidden, hut it will be impossible for the Importer in such a case to pay for a considerable time.     The new regime contemplates the control of all imports.      It will be worked by making estimates of the exchange likely to be available in future months and all imports will be conditional on the obtaining of permits which will only be issued if it is estimated that due payment can bo made.     A scale of preference is to be drawn up as between different kinds of imports.7. The German Government have intimated that they would like to enter into discussions with us on the effects of the application of the new regime to British trade, and have askrtd
whether, in view of the fact that the personnel which they have available for such discussions are already very much occupied in similar negotiations with other countries, we would send a delegation to Berlin.     As the effects of the new regime on british trade with Germany will obviously be of the first importance, I decided, in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, to accept the invitation of the German Governmentand Sir Frederick Leith-Ross left on September 17th for Berlin.The immediate object of the visit is to endeavour to ascertainprecisely what the German Government has in mind.     As soonas these preliminary discussions are concluded, Sir frederick leith-Ross will return to London to report and to obtain thenecessary instructions.8. Before Sir Frederick Leith-Ross left for Berlin, heattended an important deputation which was received by Dr. Burginon my behalf at the Board of Trade consisting of representativesof the cotton and wool yarn and coal interests.     They camo toplace before the Government their views regarding the outstandingcommercial debts and the difficulty of future trade with Germanyso long as these debts were not paid.     They insisted that it wasimpossible for traders themselves to secure a settlement of the debt question;    the difficulty in Germany did not lie withtheir customers but with the German Government, and it was,therefore, necessary for them to seek the aid of their own government in the matter.     The object of Sir F. Leith-Ross&apos;visit was fully explained to the deputation, who were at thesame time assured that every possible effort would be made tosecure an early settlement of the outstanding debts.9. As will appear from the foregoing statement of theposition, no decision is required at the moment.     So soon as sir F. Leith-Ross has returned with the full facts of thesituation, it will no doubt be necessary for us to reach decisions as to the steps which it may be desirable to take,Board ofTrada,21st September, 1934. .
