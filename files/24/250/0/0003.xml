[IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).   C R E T.1.178  (54). COPY NO. jf*cabinet.REPORT CP THE COMMITTEE ON THE CONTROL OF PRIVATE FLYING AND OTHER CIVIL AVIATION QUESTIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State- for Air.1. I circulate this memorandum in order that the Cabinetmay be aware of certain major issues arising from a Report dealing with Civil Aviation which I shall be presenting to Parliament shortly, particulsrly as at least one of its recommendations will entail legislation.2. The Report in question is that of an independent committee which I appointed last summer under the Chairmanship of Lord Gorell to review the regulations at present governing private flying in this country and certain other important civil aviation questions.     There had been a growing agitation in variou quarters for some time past for greater freedom to be accorded to Civil Aviation - more particularly to private flying;  and, independently of this agitation,  I had myself reached the con-elusion that, in view of the developments of recent years, it was desirable to bring our present system of control under review.3. Lord Gorell&apos;s Committee was given,  as material uponwhich to work, the report of a domestic Committee of departmental officials, who had already made a thorough preliminary survey of the ground and&quot;, generally speaking, they have endorsed the proposals of this domestic Committee, though in some respects their recommendations go further than these proposals.4. The Report contains a large number of miscellaneousproposals of minor importance.      There are, however, three major recommendations to which I desire to draw specific attention.
14These are as follows :-(i)    That the control of airworthiness of civil aircraft should be devolved from the Jar Ministry to the Joint Aviation q-advisory Committee of Lloyd&apos;s Register and the British Corporation Register,  reconstituted as a statutory autonomous and executive authority and renamed &quot;The Air Registration Board&quot;.The Air Ministry has for some years past &quot;been progressively devolving a good deal of airworthiness work to this outside organisation.      The domestic Committee had advised a large extension of this devolution, provided the organisation was effectively re-constituted on a broader basis,  and I propose to accept this recommendation of Lord GorellTs Committee,  subject to one important exception.      I do not consider we should be justified in entrusting to a new and untried organisation the issue of &quot;type&quot; certificates of airworthiness in respect of the larger passenger-carrying air liners.      The technique of aeronautical construction is still very much more fluid than that of steamships or road transport vehicles.      The Board of Trade retains strict control over the design and construction of steamships to carry more than IS passengers; and the Ministry of Transport exercises a similar control over public transport vehicles to carry more than 7 passengers.      It seems to me, therefore,  that the Air Ministry owes it to the travelling public to retain,  for the present at all events,  control over the larger passenger-carrying aircraft,  at least in so far as concerns the issue of &quot;type&quot; certificates of airworthiness.      I propose to announce this as a decision on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government rather than as a purely departmental decision.I intend to consider further the extent to which the new body shall .receive statutory recognition,  and its precise&apos; organisation and title.      It cannot be self-supporting for some
years to corne arid the Committee recommend that any deficit in its working shall he made good from Air Votes.      I propose that four-fifths of such deficit shall be so made good during the early years of its existence subject to an overhead maximum and such other safe-guards as may be agreed with the Treasury, who have accepted the principle of initial assistance from Air Votes.(ii)    That the introduction of a. scheme of compulsory third party insurance for limited sums,  or adequate alternative indemnity, against the damage caused by civil aircraft to persons or property on the ground would be in the general interests of the community; and that,  subject to compulsory third party insurance,  an alrworthi-ness certificate in the case of an aircraft used for private flying. should in future be optional.I propose to accept this recommendation.      It will,  of course, take time to elaborate a scheme of compulsory third-party insurance, and legislation on the subject will in due course be required.(iii)    That if any restrictive action is necessary in regard to Sunday flying it should be taken under the Sunday observance ordinances.I should naturally be opposed to any restrictive action in respect of Sunday flying which would in effect entail discrimination against aviation as opposed to other activities. I propose therefore to accept this recommendation.5. My colleagues should also be aware that,  for reasons forwhich no satisfactory explanation has been forthcoming (I suspect the pertinacity of Lieutenant-Colonel Moore-Brabazon and one other member of the Committee) lord Gorell has elected to deal with certain matters which were quite clearly outside the CommitteeTs terms of reference - a fact of which he was fully aware.      These
matters include a discussion of whether the control of Civil Aviation should remain with the Air Ministry or be transferred elsewhere,  and&quot; of the internal organisation of certain departments of the Ministry,      A majority of the Committee appreciate that the transfer of Civil Aviation from the Air Ministry is impracticable in any event for years to come,  since it would entail an extensive duplication of technical staff and consequent extra, expense, whilst Civil Aviation would also lose the greet benefits it at present derives from direct contact with the research and experimental work undertaken by the Air Ministry for milit8.ry purposes.Lieutenant-Colonel Moore-Brabazon and another member of the Committee,  in a curiously intemperate minority reservation, almost every sentence of which contains a mis-statement of fact, advocate the immediate transfer of Civil Aviation to another department.     A second minority reservation, howerer,  signed by the most experienced member of the Committee,  expresses the view that Civil Aviation should remain permanently with the Air Ministry and thus effectiTely cancels out the first reservation.6. In presenting the Report to Parliament I propose toprefix to it a note outlining the decisions which have been reached on its mcrin recommendations.      Further,  since the Committee have gone so far outside their terms of reference, it will be necessary for me to comment briefly on the relevant sections of the Report and the two minority reservations above referred to.      I propose to state that &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention of changin a basis of air organisation which has been so successful that it has since been adopted by a number of foreign nations, including France and Italy.7. Whilst I have thought it right to circulate this
17memorandum briefly outlining the major features of the Report and my proposals in regard to them, I do not ask for its discussion in Cabinet, unless any of my colleagues have points which they wish to raise.L.LIE MINISTRY.5th July, 1934.
