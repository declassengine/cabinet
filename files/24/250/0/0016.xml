Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 191 (34).CABINET.JAPANESE COMPETITION: IMPOSITION OF TEXTILE QUOTASIN CEYLON.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN continuation of my papers CP. 172 (34) and CP. 184 (34), I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a copy of further telegraphic correspondence with the Governor of Ceylon.(Initialled) P. C.-L.Downing Street, July 16, 1934.ANNEX.(1)Telegram from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 11th July, 1934. (Received 5-5 p.m. 11th July, 1934.) Priority.  No. 130.  Secret.Your telegram No. 103, Secret. Ministers represent that it is impossible for them to give definite reply at such short notice. Before they agree to introduce legislation, they will need time to ascertain measure of support which they can obtain in the Council.For this purpose it is essential that they should be able to tell Councillors of proposals as to Soya Beans and Plumbago.They ask that decision may be postponed for a week.(2)Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.Dated 11th July, 1934.(Received 5-28 p.m. 11th July, 1934.)Private and Personal.My secret telegram of to-day&apos;s date represents utmost I can get out of Ministers after two Conferences with them.I think that there is a fair chance of Ministers agreeing to introduce legislation, if the plumbago and the soya bean promises can be communicated to Councillors individually. [10313]
They would, in my own opinion, really like to be relieved of the responsibility by an Order in Council embodying present suggestions, though they would, of course, protest publicly.I feel that to impose quota system by Order in Council would almost certainly result in a constitutional crisis, as opinion against it is distinctly hardening.(3)Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the governor of Ceylon.(Sent 8 p.m. 12th July, 1934.) Important.  Private and Personal.Your telegrams No. 130 and Private and Personal 11th July. My colleagues and I agree to the following course : 1. Further time to be given to Ministers to decide not exceeding a week and less if possible.2. Such further time to be given on understanding that if they agree they will immediately introduce duties and support them, and that duties must be passed with all possible despatch, if necessary being certified.3. Plumbago and soya bean proposals may be communicated by Ministers to Councillors individually, but they should understand that if these proposals become public there is a serious risk of forestalling before next year&apos;s Finance Bill here. In the case of plumbago it would be very easy for an unlimited amount of foreign plumbago to be imported by British firms.4. As stated in my telegram of 9th July, Private and Personal, if we have to initiate and carry our own proposals because Ministers refuse to introduce and support Board of Trade offer, we should be bound to carry proposals satisfactory to this country, i.e., quota or duty of 3d. Quota is infinitely preferable for reasons stated in that telegram. In favour of quota there is the further additional argu-ment that it would be much more difficult to justify a duty of 3d., as against the compromise suggestion of l\d., when it would be known that the compromise proposal had been made. Quota, on the other hand, can be represented as a complete and preferable alternative to proceeding by way of duty. To us this argument appears to be almost unanswerable.5. I note you think quota would result in constitutional crisis. Would not similar crisis equally ensue if we certified 3d. duty ? What form do you think such crisis would take 16. It will, I think, be impossible to avoid pronouncement in reply to questions on my Vote to-day. If I am questioned I cannot avoid saying that negotiations are still proceeding with Ministers, and that it will be necessary to have recourse to our overriding powers if a satisfactory agreement is not reached.(4)Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.Dated 13th July, 1934.(Received Colonial Office 1 -14 p.m. 13th July, 1934.)Private and Personal.In reply to your private and personal telegram of 12th July, imposition of quota will, I fear, lead to rejection of the Budget.Imposition of 3d. might produce same result, but I should doubt it. A material consideration is that a duty would bring in revenue which Ministers would try to use in such a manner as to reduce hardship to the poorer classes.I had hoped, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be content to secure enactment of compromise proposals. I beg earnestly that this may be accepted, as duty of 3d. means adding to the cost of clothing of the poorest people practically 200 per cent.
