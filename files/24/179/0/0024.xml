Composition arid Terms of Reference.At their meeting on Friday, the 26th February, 1926 (Cabinet 8 (26), Conclusion 18), the Cabinet agreed that an Inter-Departmental Committee in regard to the Agenda and organisation of the forthcoming Imperial Conference should be set up under the Chairmanship of Sir Maurice Hankey, who should be left to obtain the instructions of Ministers as to the representation of their various Departments.The Committee was constituted as follows : Lieut.-Col.

2. Title of the Conference.The Committee have assumed that, following the precedent of 1923, the Meeting will be known as the &quot; Imperial Conference, 1926.&quot;3. A Single Conference.In a telegram, dated the 23rd February, 1926, the Prime Minister informed the Dominion Prime Ministers that the British Government contemplated that economic matters should be discussed either at the Conference itself or at Committees of the Conference. This Report is accordingly based on the assumption that there will be a single Imperial Conference in 1926, and no separate Imperial Economic Conference as in 1923.4. British Representation.The question of British Representation at the Conference is one for Ministerial decision. In 1923 the following arrangements were approved by the Cabinet (Cabinet 47 (23), Conclusion 8) : Imperial Conference Representation : The Prime Minister (Mr. Baldwin),The Lord President of the Council (Lord Salisbury),The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Lord Curzon),The Secretary of State for the Colonies (the Duke of Devonshire),to form the permanent nucleus of members, other Ministers attending as Members according to the nature of the business.Imperial Economic Conference : The President of the Board of Trade (Sir P. Cunliffe Lister).The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. N. Chamberlain)  or FinancialSecretary to the Treasury (Mr. Guinness). The First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Amery). The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (Sir R. Sanders). The Secretary for the Department of Overseas Trade (Colonel Buckley).Lord Salisbury attended the Imperial Conference in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee of. Imperial Defence. Lord Cecil (Lord Privy Seal) attended Meetings of the Imperial Conference at which League of Nations questions were discussed. Mr. Amery attended the Imperial Economic Conference as specially interested in oversea settlement and other economic questions. Colonel Buckley attended that Conference in his capacity as Chairman of the&apos; Oversea Settlement Committee, and other Ministers attended according to the nature of the business.The Secretary of State for India attended the Imperial Conference as head of the Indian Delegation. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies represented the Colonies, Protectorates and British Mandated Territories at the Imperial Economic Conference.In addition to the Representatives named above, the following Ministers attended Meetings of the Imperial Conference for the discussion of subjects which particularly concerned their respective Departments : The Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Secretary of State for War. The First Lord of the Admiralty. The Secretary of State for Air. The President of the Board of Trade.In view of the fact that Dominion Delegations rarely, if ever, comprise more than four Ministerial Representatives, the Cabinet may wish to consider whether the British representation should be fixed at four or five Ministers (exclusive of the Secretary of State for India), other Ministers attending as Members according to the nature of the business.
5. Date of the Conference.The Dominions and India have agreed to the Conference being held in October next.    It  is  suggested that a  convenient  opening date  would be  Tuesday, 5th October, provided that the Autumn Session of the Assembly of the League of Nations has then ended.6. Place of Meetings.In accordance with precedent, the opening and plenary meetings of the Con-ference should be held at 10, Downing Street. It is suggested that Meetings of the main Committees of the Conference should, if possible, take place in Conference Rooms in the Foreign Office, Dominions Office and Cabinet Offices. Smaller Com-mittees might hold their meetings in the India Office, Board of Trade and other Departments. The Meetings of any Economic Committee appointed by the Conference should be held in the Cabinet Offices where the Imperial Economic Conference met in 1923.7. Procedure of the Conference.The Proceedings of the 1923 Imperial Conference opened with a general state-ment on the Imperial situation made by the Prime Minister, after which statements were made by the various Dominion and Indian Representatives. The second meeting was devoted to a statement by the Secretary of State for the Colonies as to the Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories, and subsequent meetings to statements on Foreign policy by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and on Defence by the Lord President of the Council, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for Air, followed in each case by full discussions In 1923 the normal arrangement was to hold meetings of the Imperial Conference and of the Imperial Economic Conference on alternate days in order to give the Dominion Prime Ministers an opportunity of attending the discussions at both Conferences.The Committee recommend : (i.) That the Imperial Conference, 1926, should, if possible, be formally opened by the Prime Minister on the morning of Tuesday, 5th October, 1926, with a general statement on the Imperial situa-tion, to be followed by statements by the Dominion and Indian Representatives. It is suggested that one whole day should be set apart for these statements.(ii.) That the immediately subsequent Meetings of the Conference should be devoted to discussions opened by statements by the British Repre-sentatives on Imperial Affairs, Foreign Policy and Defence. Any discussion on Indian Affairs would presumably be opened by the Secretary of State for India.8. Imperial Conference Committees.It is suggested that, at an early meeting, the Imperial Conference should be invited to organise its work in three main Committees to be concerned respectively with (a.) Foreign Policy and Defence Questions, (b.) Questions affecting Inter-Imperial Relations, (c.) Economic Questions.In addition, the Conference will, no doubt, appoint ad hoc Committees to examine particular questions which do not strictly fall within one or other of these main categories.9. Appointment of Inter-Departmental Committees.On the assumption that the above suggestion will be accepted by the Cabinet and with the approval of the Prime Minister, arrangements have been made for three Inter-Departmental Committees corresponding to the suggested three main Committees of the Imperial Conference to arrange for the preparation of memoranda for despatch to the Dominions and India, and also to draw up the detailed portions of the Agenda of the Conference relating to the particular subjects with which each Inter-Departmental Committee will be concerned. The Committees will also be responsible for arranging for the preparation of memoranda, &amp;c, for the exclusive use of the British Representatives.[14342] - B 2
The three Inter-Departmental Committees have been constituted as follows : (a.) Inter-Departmental Committee concerned with Foreign Policy and Defence Questions.This Committee is a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.Chairman :  Sir M. P. A. Hankey, with representatives of  The Admiralty, The War Office, The Air Ministry, The Foreign Office, The Dominions Office, The Colonial Office, and The India Office.(&amp;.) Inter-Departmental Committee concerned with Questions affecting Inter-Imperial Relations.   (Already at work.)Chairman : Mr. C. H. Montgomery (Foreign Office),with representatives of The Foreign Office, The Dominions Office, The Colonial Office, and The India Office,with power to invite representatives of other Departments (Home Office, Board of Trade, Department of Overseas Trade and Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department) concerned with particular questions.(c) Inter-Departmental Committee concerned with Economic Questions. Chairman : Sir Sydney Chapman, wuth representatives of The Board of Trade, The Treasury, The Dominions Office, The Colonial Office, The India Office,The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, The Customs and Excise Department, The Department of Overseas Trade,The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research,with power to invite representatives of other Departments (Foreign Office, Home Office, Post Office, Oversea Settlement Department, Inland Revenue and Lord Chancellors Department) concerned with particular questions.0. Documents for the Dominions and India. The Committee recommend (1.) That Inter-Departmental Committees and Departments should be requested to furnish the Cabinet Offices, at latest by Saturday, the 15th May, 1926, with copies of memoranda, &amp;c, which they desire should be in the hands of the Dominion and Indian Governments before their Representatives leave for the Conference.(2.) That, following the precedent of 1923, all documents-of the nature indicated in (1) above should be approved by a Standing Committee of Ministers before transmission to the Dominion and Indian Governments.
In 1923 the Ministerial Committee concerned with the approval of Conference documents was composed as follows : Secretary of State for the Colonies (Chairman).Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,Chancellor of the Exchequer,President of the Board of Trade.First Lord of the Admiralty,Secretary of State for War,*Secretary of State for Air.*11. Secretarial A rrangements.The Committee understand that Sir Maurice Hankey has been invited to act as Secretary of the Conference with a deputy from the Dominions Office.The Committee recommend That Sir Maurice Hankey should be nominated Secretary of the Conference with Mr. E. J. Harding, Dominions Office, as Deputy Secretary, and that, following previous precedents, each of the Dominions and India should be invited to nominate a member of the Secretariat.It is contemplated that the services of Officers of the Foreign Office, Dominions Office. Colonial Office and Board of Trade Avill be available for secretarial duties connected with the Conference and its Committees.12. Publicity.In 1923 a Minister (the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster) was asked to take charge of the general arrangements as to publicity, and attended meetings of the Imperial Conference and of the Imperial Economic Conference. The Committee recommend that the forthcoming Conference should be asked to adopt a similar procedure, and that at the first meeting the appointment of a British Minister as Minister in charge of publicity should be recommended. It would, of course, be understood that in special cases the authority of the Minister or Ministers concerned would be necessary before the issue of documents to the Press, particularly as regards any dealing with foreign affairs and defence.The Committee recommend that the Publicity Minister, if appointed, should be assisted by the Director of Information, Dominions Office, and on questions relating to foreign policy and defence by the head of the News Department, Foreign Office. Further, it would be convenient if both these officers could be authorised to attend meetings of Committees of the Conference in cases where their presence is thought desirable.Lastly, it would be convenient that all Imperial Conference documents for the Press should be issued from the Dominions Office. This was the course adopted in 1923.13. Subjects for inclusion in the Agenda of the Conference.While the detailed Agenda for the Conference must await the reports of the Inter-Departmental Committees set out in paragraph 9, the Committee think it well to give an outline of some of the more important subjects falling under each of the main heads indicated above.I. Foreign Policy and Defence.Apart from a general review of the Foreign and Defence situation as a whole,, including any League of Nations questions which may then require discussion, the. most important subjects appear to be (a) The situation created by the Locarno Treaty.(b) The Far Eastern situation.(c.) Limitation and Reduction of Armaments. (The discussions under this head would have to take account of the progress of the preparatory Committee appointed by the Council of the League of Nations in preparation for a Disarmament Conference, and of any decisions reached at the Assembly in September 1926.)* For questions respecting the War Office and Air Ministry respectively.[14342]       * b 3
(d.) Naval policy generally, and, in particular, the progress made with the Singapore base.   (The Admiralty state that their recommendations ondiscussed in 1923.)(e.) Air policy generally and in particular the progress made with Air Defence  and also the proposed development and co-ordination of Strategic Air Routes for purposes of Empire Defence and Communications.Apart from these general subjects, there are one or two special subjects which will, or may, require discussion. In particular, it is understood that the secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is anxious to raise the question of the extension of the scope of arbitration agreements, and certain matters are outstanding connected with the Antarctic and the New Hebrides. It is also possible that, as in 1923, the question of United States&apos; rights in &quot; C &quot; Mandated Territories may require consideration.II. Questions affecting Inter-Imperial Relations.As indicated in the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP. 532 (25)), it is likely that the system of communication and consultation between the Governments of the Empire on matters of common interest will come under review, and this may lead to a discussion on the question of the organi-sation of the Imperial Conference itself, its machinery, and the method of fixing its meetings. One particular aspect of this question relates to the conditions on which secret and confidential documents which are the property of Flis Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should be communicated to representatives of the Dominion Governments in London, whether or not those representatives are utilised as a medium of communi-cation between their Governments and His Majesty&apos;s Government on the topics dealt with in these documents. Another question is the extent to which it may be possible to bring the Dominion Governments into closer personal touch with the conduct of foreign affairs by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and a third is the extent to which it would be possible to improve the arrangements for the supply to His Majesty&apos;s Government of information with regard to such foreign relations as are dealt with by the Dominion Governments themselves. It is also not improbable that one or more of the Dominions may raise far-reaching questions regarding their international status.Apart from this, there are several special questions of a constitutional character, which have given rise to correspondence with the Dominions, or have required consideration on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, since the termina-tion of the last Imperial Conference. The most important of these as set out in the memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs were as follows :  (a.) The representation of the British Empire at International Conferences.(6.) The bearing of the Dominions&apos; separate membership of the League of Nations on the principle of Imperial unity, and the form of League of Nations Conventions most suited to maintain that principle.(c.) The diplomatic representation of the Empire in foreign countries.(d.) The status of foreign consuls in the Dominions.The Committee understand that it is not now thought necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to raise the specific question as regards the form of Commercial Treaties referred to on page 7 of the Secretaiy of State&apos;s Memorandum, though it is possible that other similar questions may arise between now and the Conference.As regards the question of de jure recognition of foreign Governments (also referred to in that Memorandum), this is a matter which it may be thought inadvisable to raise on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government as a separate issue; in any case, it does not seem necessary to mention it to the Dominions at this stage.Since the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum was prepared, it has become apparent that it will be necessary also to take up the question of the completion of the Resolution of the 1923 Conference on the subject of the negotiation, signature and ratification of Treaties, not only as regards League of Nations Conventions, which are referred to under (b) above, but also as regards international instruments generally.A further question which has arisen since the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum and is likely to be raised at the Conference is that of the position of the representative of the British Empire on the Council of the League of Nations.The questions discussed above are all concerned to a greater or less extent with the position of the Dominions in relation to international affairs.    it isthe subject of Navalsubstantially the same as those
325 tpossible that one question may arise which is not so related, viz., the position of the Dominions as regards appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, but it would not seem desirable for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take the initiative in this matter.III. Economic Questions.Most of the matters likely to arise under this head have already been discussed at the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923. The more important would appear to be as follows :- (a.) .The general question of promoting Imperial trade, including the work ofthe Imperial Economic Committee and the Empire Marketing grant. (p.) The whole question of oversea settlement.(c.) The question of economic defence, with special reference to any recentinstances of discrimination against British shipping. (d.) The exhibition within the Empire of Empire Films. (e.) Progress reports on (1.) The work of the Imperial Shipping Committee.(2.) Co-ordination in technical research.(3.) The Imperial Institute.(4.) Airship and wireless services.It is understood, however, that the Postmaster-General does not wish the question of Wireless Services to be raised at this stage on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(/.) Liability of State enterprises to taxation, and in particular the prospect of legislation in other parts of the Empire (legislation having been already passed here and in the Union of South Africa) and of combined action in relation to foreign countries.(g.) Certain technical commercial questions, including (1.) The question of the adoption of certain Conventions regarding maritime law.(2.) The question of the valuation for purposes of duty in the dominions of goods which are subject to duty in the United Kingdom. (3.) Certain aspects of bankruptcy law.In addition, it will no doubt be necessary to deal with the questions outstanding regarding the position of the Pacific Cable Board.IV. Other Questions.In connection with the question of oversea settlement it will be remembered that the Report of the Interdepartmental Committee (Cmd. 2608) contained recommenda-tions relative to the standardisation of Old Age Pensions and other schemes of social insurance. It may also be necessary to bring before the Conference certain matters connected with the law of Nationality, particularly the status of married women.14. Draft Telegrams to the Dominions.The Committee have incorporated in the draft telegrams attached (see Appendix) those recommendations contained in the above report which it is thought should be communicated to the Dominions and India with as little delay as possible.The Committee recommend That the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Secretary of State for India be authorised to despatch telegrams to the Dominion and Indian Governments respectively, on the lines of the drafts contained in the Appendix.15. Summary of Conclusions requiring Action by the Cabinet.The Committee draw attention to the following more important Conclusions and recommendations on which decisions by the Cabinet are required :  (1.) Decision as to the British Representation at the Conference. (Paragraph 4.) (2.) That, subject to the meetings of the Assembly of the League of Nations being then ended, the opening date of the Conference should be Tuesday, the 5th October, 1926.   (Paragraph 5.)
(3.) (i.) That the Conference should, if possible, be formally opened by the Prime Minister on the morning of the 5th October, with a general statement on the Imperial situation, to be followed by statements by the Dominion and Indian Representatives, and that one whole day should be set apart for these statements, (ii.) That the immediately subsequent meetings of the Conference should be devoted to discussions opened by statements by the British Representatives on Imperial Affairs, Foreign Policy and Defence, and that any discussion on Indian Affairs should presumably be opened by the Secretary of State for India.   (Paragraph 7.) (4.) That, at an early meeting, the Imperial Conference should be invited to organise its work in three main Committees, to be concerned respectively with (a.) Foreign Policy and Defence questions.(&amp;.) Questions affecting Inter-Imperial Relations.(c.) Economic questions.   (Paragraph 8.)(5.) That sanction should be given for the action taken respecting the three Inter-Departmental Committees corresponding to the three Main Com-mittees of the Conference referred to in (4) above.   (Paragraph 9.) (6) (i.) That Inter-Departmental Committees and Departments should furnish the Cabinet Offices at latest by Saturday, the 15th May, 1926, with copies of memoranda, &amp;c, which they desire should be in the hands of the Dominion and Indian Governments before their representatives leave for the Conference, (ii.) That, following the precedent of 1923, all documents of the nature indicated in (i) above should be approved by a Standing Committee of Ministers before transmission to the Dominion and Indian Governments.   (Paragraph 10.) (7.) That Sir Maurice Hankey should be nominated Secretary of the Con-ference, and Mr. E. J. Harding, Dominions Office, Deputy Secretary, and that, following previous precedents, each of the Dominions and India should be invited to nominate a Member of the Secretariat. (Paragraph 11.)(8.) That the arrangements regarding Publicity suggested in Paragraph 12 of the Report should be approved.   (Paragraph 12.)(9.) That the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Secretary of State for India should be authorised to despatch telegrams to the Dominion and Indian Governments respectively on the lines of the drafts contained in the Appendix to the Report.

Following from PrimeMinister for your Prime Minister.  Begins: Paragraph 1. We have now given preliminary consideration to question of Agenda for Imperial Conference. We suggest that opening meeting should be held on Tuesday, the 5th October, and that, as in 1923, Proceedings should
-commence with statements by myself, Dominion Prime Ministers, and repre-sentatives of India, as to general position on main issues of common interest.Paragraph 2. We suggest that these preliminary statements should be followed by general review and discussion of Imperial and Foreign affairs and defence since 1923 Conference.Paragraph 3. It appears to us that most convenient course will be for the Conference then to organise its work in three main Committees dealing respec-tively with (a) questions connected with foreign policy and defence; (&amp;) questions affecting Inter-Imperial relations; (c) economic questions.Paragraph 4. We have appointed Committees here to study in greater detail each of above main questions, and more detailed Agenda under each head will be&quot; communicated to you later.Paragraph 5. Preliminary list of subjects for discussion which we have drawn up is as follows : Paragraph 6. Foreign policy and defence. Under this heading, as indicated in previous correspondence, the subject most particularly requiring discussion is the whole situation created by the Locarno Treaty. Other important subjects are (1) the Far Eastern situation; (2) reduction and limitation of armaments; (3) naval policy generally and, in particular, the progress made with the Singapore base. As regards (3) Admiralty state that their recommendations will be substantially the same as those discussed in 1923. (4) Air policy generally and in particular development of air defence.Paragraph 1. Questions affecting Inter-Imperial Relations. Apart from general review of system of communication and consultation between Govern-ments of Empire on matters of common concern, there are certain particular questions of constitutional character which have arisen since 1923 and which we should like to have discussed at the Conference. The most important of these are (1) the representation of the.British Empire at International Conferences; (2) the bearing of League of Nations membership and of the present form of League Conventions and other international instruments generally on inter-imperial relations; (3) completion of Resolution of 1923 Conference on negotiation, &amp;c. of Treaties; (4) diplomatic representation in foreign countries; (5) the status of foreign consuls in the Dominions. Certain questions are also outstanding with regard to nationality.Paragraph 8. Economic questions. The chief matters appear to be as follows : (1) the general question of promoting inter-Imperial trade, including the work of the Imperial Economic Committee and the Empire Marketing grant; (2) whole question of oversea settlement; (3) economic defence; (4) exhibition within the Empire of Empire Films; (5) progress of (a) work of Imperial Shipping Committee; (6) airship services and Empire Air Routes; (c) co-ordination in technical research; (6) liability of State enterprises to taxation.Paragraph 9. Should be glad to learn as soon as possible whether you concur in preliminary Agenda outlined above and whether you have any special subjects which you would wish to have discussed.Paragraph 10. Preparation of papers on various subjects is proceeding here and these will be despatched so far as possible to reach all the Dominions by middle of July at latest. Similarly, we should be glad to receive in time for consideration before Conference opens any papers you may have prepared. It would, of course, save time if these were circulated direct by you to other Dominions and India as well as to ourselves.Paragraph 11. We propose that arrangements as regards publicity should follow those of 1923 Conference, which were, as you know, found generally acceptable to members of Conference and were also, as I understand, welcomed by Press both here and overseas.Paragraph 12. Similar telegram is being sent to other Prime Ministers and to India. As in past years, I think the question of publishing any part of Agenda must wait till replies are complete. I assume, however, that there will be general desire to announce outline of programme later on, and I have framed this telegram accordingly, though question of publication of any parts of paragraphs 6 and 7 would require further consideration.Paragraph 13. I am telegraphing separately as regards Secretarial arrangements. Ends.
&quot; B.&quot;. . ... . April.    Following&apos; from Prime Minister for your Prime Minister.Begins.-- My telegram of to-day : Imperial Conference. We hope that Hankey will be available to act as Secretary of Imperial Conference, and that, as at previous Conferences, Dominions and India will also nominate members of Secretariat. Office accommodation in Whitehall Gardens is how very restricted; hence, if you are likely to require any office accommodation here other than at hotels, should be grateful if you would let me know as soon as possible. We regret that it will not be possible to supply any clerical assistance to delegations apart from clerical requirements of Conference itself. Similar telegram sent to other Prime Ministers and India.   Ends.
