Cook.
PRIME MINISTER:    To-day I do not expect to take up a &quot;good deal of your time, &quot;but I should like to begin by thanking both parties that are here this afternoon for the way in which they responded to an appeal I made last time. I am quite sure that whatever may happen to our delibera-tions it has been a great thing that the whole matter has. been treated in the country with a sense of responsibility and without undue excitement.      I think that is worth a good deal.Since we met,  the Government have been very carefully considering the many points which arise in the Report.   We. have had a good many meetings on the subject and a good many discussions and I am quite clear that the first thing to do is to tell you,  as the two parties interested,  the Government1s attitude as regards the Report.      I have had it written out in the form in which the Cabinet authorised me to convey it to you and I will give you all copies of it.      I think it is quite obvious that this must be published.    I will read it to you; &quot;The Government have considered with great care the Report and conclusions of the Royal Commission.     The conclusions reached by the Commission do not in. all respects accord with views held by the Government and some of the recommendations contain proposals to which, taken by themselves,  the Government ax-e known to be opposed.     NevertheleaiE in face of the unanimous report of the Commission and for the sake of a general -  settlement the Government for their part will be prepared to undertake such measures as may be required of the State to give the recommendations effect , provided that those engaged in this industry - with whom the decision primarily rests - agree to accept the Report and to carry on the Industry on the basis of its recommendationso      It is our hope that in-1-
that event by the Co-operation of all parties it may be possible to find in the Report a lasting solution of the problem.&quot; If I may put the whole of that into one sentence,  it is that we accept the Report provided the other parties do so.MR.  EVAN WILLIAMS :      I do not know whether you are expecting us to say anything to-day *PRIME MINISTER:      I do not want anyone to speak to commit himself before he    has had an opportunity of considering the position of the Government and consulting his friendsj but I thought it right that as soon as possible we should make you acquainted with the decision we have come to.      I do rot know that as far as I am concerned there is anything I want to ask you.      There is one question you might consider among yourselves if you would be good enough to,  if you are happy enough to come together,  that is the question on which I should like some assistance from both of you,  the question about recruitment in mines,      v/hether it would be of assistance to the mining industry if recruitment from outside for a term of two years or three years or something like that should be stopped, and only to allow men to be taken on who are minersj    that is to say, whether it would help the unemployment in that particular industry to stop recruitment from say agricultural labour.      I do not want any answer on that, but it is a subject on which I should like some advice from those who are interested in it.      I notice  it  is a suggestion that has been made,   I think it was done in the war.      There is at the moment, and I think there must he for a time a considerable amount of surplus labour which has been trained in the mining industry and it is a question whether it Is wise to allow that labour  to be out of work in cases where it can be
employed in other parts of&quot; the country^ but- where- -other-labour which is new to mining is taken on.      I cannot remember the extent to which that ia touched on in the Report, but I have in my mind that it does refer to the question of some possible assistance being given to move miners from one part of the country to another and the two questions are rather involved.,MR. EVAN WILLIAMS:    The Report does deal rather fully with that and gives figures,PRIME MINISTER:    I think the Report does deal with that and it is a question which has been brought to my notice,      I think that is the kind of subject where we should value very much a considered judgment from both &apos; sides.MR. EVAN Yi! ILL IA MS      There are two kinds of labour that are new to mining that have been employed.     There are the boys who have never worked at all and people who have never worked. In the Industry before although they may have worked in some   other occupation so there are two aspects in it.PRIME MINISTER:    There is a distinct line of demarcation between the  two.      I do not want to go into the merits of It now, but I should be glad to have the view of the Association and the Federation on that because that is the kind of thing,   If that would be a real help,  I should be prepared to legislate on for a time.MR. EVAN WILLIAMS:    You had not in your mind any question of separating the two or of putting the two together?PRIME MINISTER:    No,  I want to hear your views on it.MR. EVAN WILLIAMS:    There Is the juvenile labour and there Is the adult.
PRIME MINISTER:    That Is right;   they are quite different.      The miner&apos;s son would naturally want to work with his father and prima facie that is a case where one would not like to interfere.      In regard to adults that is different and prims facie that seems not to he an unreason-able thing to do, but I  should like to have the views of both sides on that.MR. EVAN WILLIAMS:    As far as we are concerned we should be quite prepared to consider the question and possibly to exchange views with the other side.PRIME MINISTER:    That Is what I ask because If It were desirable to do anything, and If there were a common agreement it makes it so much easier to deal with it.MR, EVAN WILLIAMS:    Upon the statement of the Government on the main position, I  do not think we on our side are prepared to say anything at the moment,PRIME MINISTER:    I do not expect it,  I hope you will be good enough to discuss it and will consider it very carefully.      It lay with us to give the answer first and we have been walking very hard to achieve It. I may say there has been considerable reluctance to indicate an acceptance except in the hope that it may be of material help to what we all desire, and &quot;--hat is, to come to an end of these disasters in the coal tradewk - v--h nave done so much not  only to damage the conl trade, but what is a still bigger thing,  the Industry of the whole  country.MR.  HERBERT SMITH:    Take these  words  &quot;The Government for their part will be prepared to undertake such measures as may be required of the State to give the
recommendations effect&quot;, does that.....cover- therm -all and areyou going to prepare Bills to-submit to us to--errfbo^-these proposals?PRIME MINISTER:    That is what it means in the long run.      It would be difficult for me to-day to be drawn Into details because honestly I have not had the time yet to consider details.      It would be difficult for me to tell you how qiiickly,  for instance, it would be possible to cover these points,      I have set \xp Committees already to deal with a good many of the more difficult matters in the Report.    I have set up an extraordinarily strong Committee ?/hich Is taking under its view all the questions in the Report that deal with research.      All I would say to you to-day is this^ this is not meant to draw wool over anybody&apos;s eyes.      It Is as plain a statement as we can make and we are putting all our cards on the table perfectly bona fide;    we do not want to bargain and we do not want to trick.      My position,  I am sure you will recognise,  at a preliminary meeting like this is a little more difficult in some respects even than your position and Mr. Evan Williams.      You cannot well give an answer on many points until you have consulted your colleagues and with the best goodwill in the world If you will give me an answer here to-day on any point,   supposing I asked it, you could not undertake that the answer you gave would be adopted and ratified,.      If I speak and say anything my word goes you see and it will be done, and It is a very responsible position the head of the Government is In In      -    &apos; that way because It gets out and he commits the Government, and therefore to go into any question of detail at the moment would be difficult for me.     We had to work very hard to get this and it means If we get an agreement we  will fulfil our part of the bargain.
3r* 4MR. HERBERT SMITH:      I think, Mr Prime Minister,  that we have known you long enough to respect you and when you make a statement we take notice of it, but our people query it,PRIME MINISTER:      I stand by this.MR.  HERBERT SMITH:      I would like to ask you another question.      Does this mean that you leave owners and ourselves to settle in any way we can?      In the Report the subsidy ends on the last day of April.      Is the Government not going to give any further help to the industry?PRIME MINISTER:      This is a question that I expected, and I think it is best at a meeting like this - it comes beck to what I said a minute ago - I want to put all my cards on the table and I want to avoid any appearance of bargaining of any kind.      You have raised a question, Mr. Smith, on which the Commission has expressed a very definite opinion,  that question of further help, and I have just announced to you that the Government are prepared to stand by the Report, and the Report itself, as you know, Involves a good many problems requiring money.     That we shall all be agreed upon. The subsidy comes to an end on the 30th April, and it must come to an end.      The .ountry has had to pay an enormous sum of money, borne by the general taxpayer, for the benefit - I am not complaining about that,  I am just giving you the facts -of one single industry.      That is that.      But I recognise and I must recognise, that in some districts,  if a settlement is to be arrived at, the sacrifice that may be required must be heavy,  and if an agreement can be reached by the 1st of April I shall be willing to consider what temporary assist-ance may be required to ease the position, but this would be a departure from the recommendations of the Commission to that extent?    and that being so,  it must be plain that any money that may be employed for that purpose must be considered-6-
in relation to money that may have to be spent under theether recommendations of the Commission.     How by that Iam not trying to dodge out of anything.      I am merely pointing out that the amount of money that can be available inthe present state of the country&apos;s finances cannot beunlimited, and to a certain extent it must be a questionof whether we can do it or not, and if against the advice of the Commission we found that some such temporary assist-ance, say for three months - as has been done before, were going to save the situation,  then I would be prepared toconsider departure from the strict ruling of the Commission,and I vshould regard it that money spent in that way was spentfor the benefit of the industry.     That is as far as i cango to-day,      It is much fairer to say all that I have In my mindon the subject to-day than say &quot;No, we cannot consider it,&quot;and many people take the view that you would be more likelyto get to work in that event,      I want to tell you all thatis in my mind,  and that is the view I hold, and whichthe Government hold,MR. HERBERT SMITH:      I hardly agree that this has been for the benefit of this industry, and I think every Indus-try has benefited by it.      Bast year you asked us for a subsidy to encourage other trades to get away.      Now I suggest to you that the subsidy has been to the benefit of other trades,      I want you to look at it from that point.      There is a serious gap between that and the economic position of tie industry.PRIME MINISTER:      There are some other trades with a serious gap which they have never been able to make up,MR. HERBERT SMITH:      Shall we be able to get some of these Bills at an early time  to see what they are embodying because there are some important things in this Report which, if properly handled, may put the industry into a different position to what it is in now, and we want to try and findwhat is at the back of your mind, what it means-7-
as to reorganisation and other questions?PRIMS MINISTER:     Well,  of course,  I should get on t o work as though you were going to get to an agreement, hut there Is a great deal of work lying before us now, end we are losing no time in regard to It.MR. COOK&apos;:     This statement is very short and -$rague as to what is implied.PRIME MINISTER:      I do not think it is at all vague.MR. COOK..       You 3ay that you will accept the report and introduce legislative measures necessary to carry out the findings, but what sort of legislative measures?PRIME MINISTER:     I think it is clear if you look at it again - &quot;to undertake such measures as may be required of the State to give the recommendations effect&quot;.      I am dealing here with the report as it affects the Government * It is not  for me to say anything about the report from any other point of view.    The first point is whether the Government accept the report as a whole or not without exceptions.    If we had taken up the line that some parts of the report be accepted and some parts, which many of us do not like were not accepted, there would be no prospect of finality,  because it is perfectly obvic-s then that other parties would say they like something here which we do not, and we pick and choose, so we try to do something to help both parties by saying we do accept the report, and we will do our part in implementing what is in the report if the other parties do the Borne.MR. COOK:        The point I put is as to what are the interpretations the Government put upon the recommendations contained therein, the shape of them.   We are not asking  ...1 unreasonable thing.    One thing you can say &quot;I accept&quot; ,\ but what is the form, what method is adopted?   Supposing I wlas to say now as to. what the report recommends in /regard to tyhe Pit Committee - what do you mean by that?   The whole thing rp
vague from that point of view,      I am not doubting your intentions, but wo  would like to say this;    you would be the last to buy a pig in a poke, to use a familiar phrase&apos;; possibly you have not made up your mind on the points of interpretation.MINISTER OF LABOUR;    Does it not mean this ?    So far as the matters In the report - one cannot go into detail -but so far as they need administrative action, it means being prepared to take that administrative action.     There are definite racommendations right through the report asking the Government to do certain things .      It res ans that some of them can be done by administration without passing fresh laws, some would mean fresh legislation.     So far as it means administrative action - the Prime Minister will correct me if I am wrong - it means we are prepared to take administra-tive action;    so far as it moans legislation, we are prepared to get the Bills ready and to take legislative action.      It must take some time, and I cannot commit myself at the moment, but I am in this position - if jointly between you you arrive at an agreement, but you ask for some thing to be varied, then the Government at your joint request,  if you coma to an agreement will be prepared to consider that.      If you come to agreamont it will ba ready to go ahead on the administrative or legislation action whic. the report recommends.      I have tried to put it as clearly as I can,  but I want to get clearly what it is that Mr Gook asks.PR 1MB! MINISTER;      The form of legislation of course does want a good deal of consideration as everybody knows who has to prepare a Bill,  and that is work we must gat along with now, and we shall not lose any time over that, and it will be our business to move along with that as fast as we oan, while you,  I hopo, will be moving along with your work.      W&apos;e shall be in touch all the time,  and obviously it will be the duty of the Minister of Labour
to be in consultation with both, sides on a number oi matters that are in the Report.      It is impossible to-day to give you more than I have given you here.MINISTER Oi-&apos; LABOUR:      I think what Mr Cook means, if I understand what he  and Mr Herbert Smith have said, is that if the Mining Association and the   Iaderation are meeting together in order to discuss their side of the question, whether they can rest assured that the Government are going   on getting into shape quite generally without any humbugging or putting off or evasion the steps put forward to the Government to take-MR RICHARBSON:    It means   until we do sea set out in the form it is necessary to set it out in the proposed Bills we cannot know whether we agree with the interpretation of the report.      us may have a difference on the report. In other words, a construction may be put on the words of the report that may be different from vsh.at we think, and therefore not of much use.MINISTER OP LABOUR:      Would it not in that case be quite right and proper that either the Federation or the Association should come back to us and say &quot;What   -meaning do you put on this, because we want to know on this, that or the other recommendation;  that neither side should delay their consideration as between you. two until perfection has been achieved, or rather can be achieved,  and everything can bo got ready on the other side, and you can como back and. go    into any question of doubt as to the attitude to be adopted.MR COOK:    You say a &quot;doubt&quot; - on what?   We have nothing at the moment tangible to have our doubts about.As you said, there are a number of questions that require legislative action,  others that are administrative, which are subject to agreement on both sides.      well, surely
with so much involved,  such changes involved to both sides,  involving a great body of men, I do not know whether it is right for us to be suspicious, what can we say from this, what is the form of your interpretation of the recommendations.      A short schedule can be prepared on the items that require both administrative and legislative action particularly on your side.      That is not asking to&amp; much before anything tangible is arrived at.PRIME MINISTER:    I see what you mean.MINISTER OE LABOUR:    I do not see why they should not come back to us on any points as they come up.MR. HERBERT SMITH;    I am not questioning your honesty, but you have shoved us into a siding that is going to have a dead end.      Until we know what is going to be done we cannot discuss anything with the owners, you have shoved us into a siding.     &quot;We will keep in touch with your people, and you ought to give us a lead, M-&quot;. Prime Minister,  as to your intentions on your side.      I am looking at the 3Oth April,  it is not a long way away.      Unless we are active we ai*e go trig to do harm to everyb ,-dy.-11-
PRIME MINISTER:    What was it exactly, Mr. Cook, that you wanted, &quot;because we do not want to see a Bill on every subject in detail.    They take an enormous time to prepare.      The recommendations,  of course,  are very clear. I should have thought this opening statement of mine was very clear, &quot;but if there is anything we can clear up fairly quickly for you we would be very glad to try and do it.     Of course we have not got unlimited time before us,      I have brought you to-day what I thought was a clear statement giving our attitude.     We have not yet heard anybody else&apos;s attitude towards the Report.MR. COOK:    Well sir,  surely it is not asking anything impossible, seeing you have considered this in some detail,  to give us a short memorandum, not the whole Bill but a short memorandum on the points which you have in your mind, both legislative and administrative,  and the method of application.      I will just give you an instance.      If we were asked a question on this, as to one point, they would say what does it mean.      They would say to our President on the Pit Committees - for the establishment of obligatory profit-sharing schemes - whax do you mean about that?      I should have to say I do not know anything about it.      It is a pig in a poke for us,PRIME MINISTER:    Just a word on that.      That again is a thing v/hich is mentioned in the Report.      That is a subject that would require a good deal of investigation with you and with the owners.     We have not got the experience yet on that particular subject to know what is the wisest thing to do.    We have got to hack something out.MR. COOK:    But how can we?   Again I say it to it$ir Arthur Steel-Maitland.      You say talk it over between yourselves.     Let us have a formula or a resolution to talk
to, on the subject matter under discussion.      Surely we are only asking for that in a proper business way?30I0IIET, IANE POX:      Talk It over together and see If there are any points of agreement.MR. HERBERT SMITH:      Mr- Prime ilinister, we are going to make a serious blunder here today.      The first thing is we have your views on paper,. &apos;hat you intend doing.    The next thing we expect is what the owners have &quot;got to say.      It Is fair that they should tell us their position, somewhere else if not here,  because I oan see us standing to attention until the 30th April.    We are business men.    I think the first&quot;1 thing we have to get is a pronouncement from you people in\ detail in answer to the simple question Mr.  Oook put abouJt -the Pit Committees,that you should not go away from the 1920 agreement.    If you do not, there is nothing in it.    TheInext thing is,  is there to be reorganisation of the industry. How are we going to know your minds?     We had to tell you^JLn 1925, last year, that we would not be responsible for the chaotic condition the industry was in;    we are still in that position^     We want to help.      If you decide against nationalisation I am not going to try and make it an industry that will not pay.     Whether it is private enterprise or otherwise, as long e    I am in that business I am going to do my share to make it a success.      I will still work for nationalisation, but I am not going to sit still until I get it o(At this point of the proceedings,  5.20 pom. the Prime Minister and his colleagues withdrew).
The Conference resumed at 5.50 pVmuD        PRIME MINISTER:    Well, Gentlemen,  I have been thinking,--ovar-What--you have said very carefully.     You see the Government have gonea long way, a long way,  to-day, and neither of you have gone any wayat all.      I do not blame you for that because I  did not expect you to, and it is not the time to do so.      But we have, and I am sure that Mr. Cook does not mean that he wants details of Bills before doing anything on his part.      That,  I think, would be an unreasonablerequest.      I recognise the anxiety that has been expressed, because there have been failures in the past,  and we are bound to find acertain amount of soreness and a certain amount -of prejudice, but i cannot imagine anything at this moment much clearer than the state-onment I have read,   and we are going on/the assumption that theFederation are going to come to an agreement with the association on the lines of the Report.      We have to make that assumption at themoment to go on with the work in hand in examining the Bills thatwill be required and get some estimate as far as we can. of how muchmaterial will be in that,  and the time likely to be taken in their passage.     All that Is our business.      As 1 said before,  I haveCommittees at work now on that very subject, examining    all theI questions, both the very complicated ones and the comparativelyI simple ones, and in plenty or  time before the 30th April I shallknow quite clearly the amount of Bills that will be necessary toI implement our pledge,  on the assumption that you can come to anagreement.      If you do not come to an agreement,  then of course anentirely new situation arises.     The pledge we have given is on theassumption that you do come to an agreement, but really,  gentlemen,the ball is with you now.      We have to remember that beyond the 30thI April the subsidy in its present form cannot, go on,  and whateverI financial assistance may be given is expressed in the terms  which I ,ghave already read to you,  and if progress Is to be made It is absolutely essential that you should get together without a momentrsjjjidelay.     You will be doing your work on the one side,  we shall be doingours on the other,   and doubtless we shall be in freqxrent communication--14-
and with regard to many of the things that are in the Report there are some that you would only have to discuss between yourselves, there are others which must be discussed between both the Federation and the Association and the Government.     The question that Mr. Cook raised about profit sharing is a most difficult and. intricate subject, and thst is one that primarily must be solved by consultation of the people who have full knowledge and interest in the question.     But I do not want to go into any details at this moment.      This is hardly the tirre, and we have none of us had the amount of time for prepara-tion necessary to enable us to speak on all those things.      I do hope that we can get to work in a spirit of trying to get to an agreement, and dismiss from, our minds what I  completely dismissed from mine, any idea of trying to manoeuvre for position, or do anything like that. I have put all my cards on the table,  I have told you frankly what we can do,  I have told you that the Government accept the Report, and I have given you my undertaking that we will carry out such things in the Report as call for Government action on the condition that you two parties can come to an agreement.     As I say,  before you come to the 30th April we shall then know exactly the amount of legislation that will be necessary and more or less the form that it will take.      There will be plenty of time before you put your signatures to anything to See that,  and if you are so happy as to put your signatures to any agreement wa shall know then we shall be free to go on as quickly as we can.      I have been very frank to-day, and even what I have been able to say to you has been the result of a great deal of work and a great deal of thinking, and i think now wihout a doubt it is up to you to get a little bit of a move on to try and compensate me for the very/ considerable move I have managed to get on with my Government.MR. SMITH:    Is not that rather putting us Into the position that this is a bargaining question?PRIME MINISTER:    I do not think so.      I have no idea of that in my mind at all.MR. SMITH:    I want to put it to you that you have appointedthis Commission, and I take it the Government is prepared, to accept-15-
the Report of the Conclusion, that apart from whether the one or other differs the Government would go on with its business, would it not? PRIME MINISTER.    What do you mean exactly?MR- SMITH:    If you say,  &quot;We will adopt  this subject to you people settling&quot;,  that seems to be a bargaining position.PRIME&apos;MINISTER:    In that sense of bargaining,  you may say the whole Report is.     You cannot expect me to make my party swallow a lot of things they do not like if there is going to be a general stoppage In this country that is going to reduce its financial power far below what It is to-day.MR.  SMITH:    I may be wrong, but I think I could expect you to adop this procedure, that having&quot; appointed the Commission you are  going to abide by the findings of that Commission irrespective of either party. There are plenty of things in this Report that we do not like.PRIME MINISTER:    That is why I say there are a -lot of things we do-not like.      If we all swallow this Report,   we are  doing it for the same of peace.      We are all going to swallow what we do not like o My job is to get a great party to endorse what I am going to put before them, and if we are going to carry out this Report we have all got to do that,  there is no question about that.      We are all going to have a lot of men amongst those who are our supporters who will not like a good deal that is in -he Report, there is no question about it,     I am sure it is the case with you and with the owners and with me.MR. SMITH:    Does not that put us exactly in the position that we want to know what interpretation is put on this Report,      That is the consequence.      You may say,  &quot;I agree with you, Smith,  in Principle on certain, things&quot;, but when we come to details we may be far apart.PRIME MINISTER:    I have gone a good long way to-day in explain-ing my position, and,  as I have  just explained to you, we are now
getting along as fast we we can,     We have wasted no time, we have teen working on this, we are now getting along at the legislation that would he required.      Before a signature is affixed we shall know quite nearly enough exactly what legislation will be required.      If anyone feels that legislation or such legislation is not satisfactory to tliom, they are not obliged to sign anythir-og.MR COOK:    ii/e do not know at all your interpretations, and we accept in good faithSECRETARY FOR MIKES:      They are clear enough.MR COOK:      I could put to you at le.st 12 questions straight off that I am not clear on as to how they are going to -he applied, and I suppose the owners can do- the same.PRIME MINISTER:     Are not those just the things we must studybetween ourselves--?     There are several points in the Report whereit will be of the greatest value before you decide on the ultimateform in which a .B111 may be passed to consult :hoth the association and the Federation, and that is part of the work that I want us to got on. to at once without any delay, but.if we utilise the time we h&amp;ve plenty of brains to get along and do the business, but do hot let us hang back for one another.     I have gone a long way, asI think anyone will admit in the short time by the Government asa whole aocepting the Report and pledging itself to implement therecommendations *MR COOK:      That means that your Colleagues in the Cabinetunderstand the implications and the interpretations of that report ?PRIME MINISTER:      They have given a general assent, and they will assent to legislation,MR COOK:      It is quite evident that they have got to the stage that they know the interpretations.      We do not know your int erpre t at io na .PRIME MINISTER:      They cannot yet know details of Bills -  If you have a Report to study, &apos;you may give a good deal of study -E;o it and you may say &quot;Yes,  I will accept this,  and will give iegislation to give effect to this&quot;, but you want to think a...hit
to see what would bo the bast way to give effect to it. That oarrnot be done in five minutes-MR RICHARDSCM:      Is not the implication from the fact that you appointed the Commission that you appointed It for the purpose of making recommendations, and could not we expect that you would adopt the report of your own Commission or why did you appoint them YPRIME MINISTER.      It is vory clear that at the time the Commission was appointed thsy ware appointed to inves&quot;isi-gate   a whole lot of subjects in connection with the industry, and to try,  if they could , to show us In what way it was possible to get out of the impasse&apos; in which we found ourselves last August.     They have made a number of reoommenda tions, recommendations to you., to the owners, and to us.    I say at this stage that if tho other parties accept the recpmmendations of that report, I do.    I think that is very straight and very fair, and no one has told me anything, but I do not ask them to do so thi3 afternoon.at this moraont when we have a conference of two hundred or three hundred delegates who want to knew.     We may have perfect faith in what you say, but that is all we would have. We are obliged to ask them to have faith in the Prime Minister&quot;s statement that the Government are going to accept this report.    I agree with you that you cannot give details at tho moment as to how it is to be cone,  but it is possible to enumerate the things in the report that you are going to deal &quot;svith, For instance, you have told us that you have severalCommittees considering different phases of the report.   You mentioned research.      Is it not possible to give us an outline of the matters arising from the report which requiro legislation and to say you are going to take the necessary steps to legislate upon those., and where the Ministry of labour said there are some things that can be done by administration.     You might also set out those things and sayMR RICHARDS:yourself in our placa
you are going to deal with thorn by Government administration. That is about the least that we can hope for when wa go to meet our men,  to have something intelligible to say to them, to say &quot;here is research&quot;;   &quot;they are adopting the Commisa ion&apos;s report and going into rather more detail as to what should be -,one.?!      There is very little difficulty in that,    &quot;If the report is accepted as a &quot;Whole, they say exactly what should be done.      There are other subjects which are not set out in that detail but which will require legislation before they can be put into operation.&quot;     It is because we feel ourselves to be in a difficulty,  it is hot that we want to be captains.BRIMil MINISTER:    Ho. no.MS RICHAR IS :      *e are visualising to-morrow morning.PRIME MINISTER:      You asked me to put myself in your position.     Put yourselves in my position.      What a short time has gone by.      I made to the Government the state-ment I have made to you which I think is a very big statement to start with.     The first thing, and the necessary thing, for us now really, is for the two parties most interested to get together.       Nobody wants to delay that, because time is short and there is a great deal to bo done.    We have a great deal to/do.     We shall be busy all through Easter and right away as hard as we can go.      we are going on in perfect good faith ana with no idea of drawing the wool over anybody&apos;s eyes.      We are going forward, straightforwardly,&apos;on the statement I have mentioned hare.MINISTER OP LABOUR j     May.I givo one sort of instance which may perhaps meet the views.      Wa are all talking hare quite openly.    Take the question of research.      The Government have set up a Committee which is at this moment going into tho question of the constitution of the, suggested Fuel and Paver Committee and Research,        The Report
suggests that      The Report does not suggest all the details of how it should be composed, but they do suggest that the question should be gone into.     They suggest such a Committee and they suggest things in regard to research, but they do not give every detail.      What the Prime Minister has already done is to set up a Committee to go into that recommendation and to see how to give it actual form,PRIME MINISTER:      It has begun to sit.MINISTER OP LABOUR:      That has.been sitting already, It cannot really work out the form of the vhing and all that in a minute.MR.  RICHARDS:      No6PRIME MINISTER:      It all takes trouble, MR. RICHARDS:      We accept that.MINISTER OF LABOUR:     There Is also a Committee going into the question of royalties.      We are going into all these things simultaneously so as to see how they can be given effect to and the proper form for giving effect to them.     That cannot be done in a day.      There are all these points one after the other,      I have just enumerated two of the main points,      I can only say that  they are working pretty hard*      We have to get clown to the actual shape of the thing, the way in which effect can be given to it0 That is how the Government has accepted it, and accepted It as the Prime Minister has said, with every wish to give effect to It,      Does not that make it clear?MRc RICHARDS:     Yes,  If you went on with all the other subjects that are the subject of recommendation in this Report,      In principle you say those are the recommendations and you are now considering the details for the purpose of putting them into operation.PRIME MINISTER:     Every recommendation,MR. RICHARDS:      There should be the same kind of Informs-tion on every recommendation, that the Government are.-20-
accepting them and are proceeding cither to legislate or to make the necessary administrative preparations,MR, COOK:      Ihat about a schedule?      &quot;Such measures as are in the following schedule,&quot;     Surely that is not asking too much.      sMR, RICHARDS:    The silent partner&apos;has to be taken into account in this.      We do not knew what they are going to tell us,PRIME MINISTER:     Do you mean something like this -&quot;The following are the recommendations which are now being examined?&quot;MR.  COOK:      &quot;Such measures as are In t.: e following schedule,&quot; or something following on the lines suggested there.     Mr. Richards las put the point,      We have to meet to-morrow twenty of our men, each of whom has as great a responsibility as we have.      Secondly, we shall have to meet - and It is not an easy task on our side - a great body of men each of whom will put his own particular point of view.PRIME MINISTER:      I have had experiences like that when meeting a body of men In the House of Commons who are very much opposed to my view,MR,  COOK:     And you do it well,PRIME MINISTER.    I stand up to them,MR. COOK:      It is all right when, you have the majority on your side.      You have the majority to start with and there is the difference between us.     You have something In black and white.      It is not Cook&apos;s interpretation,  it is not Smith&apos;s interpretation, but the Governments Interpretation.MINISTER OF LABOUR:      I would only give the sort of Instance and I am sure the Prime Minister would agree that
3Q7it does not really,  if I may say so, take away the obligation which rests on the Federation and the Associa-tion that the ball is. now with them.      You asked as to what the Government are doing.      I have told you about research.      The next is the Fuel and Power Committee,      We have a committee going into that question.     The same is true of the next recommendstion, we are now considering the suggested system of official sampling and analysis.     That means consultation.     As regards the suggestion that Local Authorities should be empowered to engage in the retail sale of coal, the system of that is being considered at the same time by another committee - and so on, right through the whole of these recommendations.     You can get them; they are enumerated one after the otier,MR. RICHARDSON: The Prime Minister says to us that we have got to provide legislation for certain things, there are other provisions which would have to be carried out by administrative departments. There are others you have to deal with, lias the Government scheduled these for their own satisfaction, and if they have can they give us a copy of what they have scheduled?MINISTER OF LABOUR:      The answer is that we have a list of what the Government has to do, and we are going into those natters, but I am quite sure that I think that is all you can ask the Government at the -resent stage. They have got to work out all of those. As the Prime Minister said, the ball is really now at your feet, knowing that we are working those out in order to give effect to them, and the Prime Minister lias given his general piedge w 1.,ich embodies all that, heally the ball now lies with you and with the Association to get together on it.-22-
MR. HERBERT SMITH;      I cannot agree that the hall is at our feet, at all?   The ball is &quot;between you two, anil we want it to shew itself.     We must get to that.   The House is expeoted to break tip on the list April and to resume on the 13th, and we think that you two people ought to tell      where you standoMINISTER OS LABOUR;    It is for all of us.MR. COOX:     The declaration is yours.
MR.RICHARDS:      It is not  as if we were the Government to  decide..  We have always to make preparations for - well in South Wales, for instance,  I know the number - over four hundred branches,  four hundred different sets of men who will want to consider anything that is put up to them In the form of a settlement either with the Government or with the ooal owners, and take myself, suppose I took this document and the Report and go through It and send It out to my four hundred branches, which they will expect to know, the Government are/going to do so and so with this;    they have acoepted the Commissions report and they are going to legislate upon this subject.    I should be bound to add some word of explanation, which may be entirely wrong when the Government come to express their views on the matter whereas they would have the Governments document with  just a few lines of explanation and our men would then have a dear thing to oonsider and we should have very muoh less trouble.MR. COOK:    Surely that is not asking too much in view of the fact that the report first has to operate with our men;    there are two sides.PRIME MINISTER:    I see the point.MR. COOK:    This is your part of the proposals;    our friends&apos; proposals I hope we shall get to-morrow.    The point is if we get proposals from you and from our friends we shall be in a position to know where we stand;    at the moment we have nothing before us.      You are the first people to let us know. We have nothing yet from our friends here.MR. EVAN WILLIAMS:    We are meeting to-morrow after-noon.PRIME MINISTER:    When do you meet your executive? MR. COOK:    To-morrow morning.
PRIME MINISTER:    What you want if I understand the point you have been making:,, yen want to see followingthis statement for tho benefit of tho people a schedule ofthe recommendations that are effective.. MR. RICEARPS:    Yes,  Sir, which you propose to dealwith&apos;.PRIME MINISTER:      I mean when we say we are prepared to undertake such measures as may be required cf the State to give the recommendations effect, y ou want for the benefit of your people the recommendations put down.MR. RICHARDS:    That is. right.PRIME MINISTER:    I cannot see any harm in that. .-I should not have thought It was necessary but I see the point you..have put  find it is perfectly clear by the  last part of this draft that I have put before you now that that is part of the general;agreement if a general agreement is come to.     Perhaps.one of you.would be good enough t\Qu. at ay behind with Mr.  Jones and see him draw it up and you can take it .away with you.     You can do that;    all of you stay if you like.      It will save people referring to the report vshich some may think difficult.     ,1 am having the report sold at 3d. a copy, but I do not suppose everybody will have a copy. -; - ..MR. RICHARDS:    If I  dare venture to make the observation it is important to.the ccalowners too.      Of course they resent your doing anything&apos;, I know but with or without resentment it is necessary to-know the extent to which you do propose to  deal. - ith. the. matter.-PRIME MINISTER:.   Perhaps we can get. an agreed report of the meeting that has talc en place to-day.
lOt EVAN wTLLIAMS:      Is it advisable to issue anything more than your communication to us-PRIME MINISTER:      I like to keep those things as short as possible,  but I think we can trust Mr Cook, Mr Lee and Mr Jonas to do that.MR COOK:      Everybody knows we are not here for nothing and rath ex- than get all the imaginary details in the press it is hotter for us to get an agreed report. .13 never have any difficulty, Mr lee, Mr Jones and myself,  in doing that.      I take it, Mr prime Minister, that we shall get a verbatim report.     It would be appreciated if wo might have it by 10 o&apos;clook to-morrow morning.PRIME MINISTER:    ^as.Mlt HERBERT SMITH:      I should like to thank you, Mr Prime Minister,  for spending so much time with us.(The proceedings then terminated.)10, Downing Street,  S*W. 1. 24th March, 1926.
