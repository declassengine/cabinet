MOST SECRET.CP. 17C (26) .CABINET.KFY   9LEAKAGE.....OF_________INFORMATION.LUXURY    TAX.Note by the Attorney-General,On April 16th my attention was drawn by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to an article appearing in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; on April 14th headed &quot;Tax on Betting in the new Budget.      Mr. Churchill&apos;s Proposal - Cabinet Consideration&quot;, and it was suggested that I should take some steps to ascertain from the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; where they obtained this information.      With this object in view I wrote a personal letter to Lord Burnham pointing out that any proposal by the Chancellor of the Exchequer with regard  to the Budget if it were circulated at all, would necessarily be in the form of a most confidential Cabinet paper and that any disclosure of its contents would be a grave breach of duty and a serious offence against the law;&apos;   and I asked him if he would be good enough to ascertain how such an article came to be published and&apos;whether there had in fact been any such illicit disclosure of Cabinet documents as the article would seem to indicate.As a result of this letter Lord Burnham sent Mr. Foss, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; Parliamentary Correspondent,  to see me and he handed to me a statement which he had sixbmltted to Lord Burnham, of which I attach s copy.  .   I had a long inter-view with Mr. Foss and I received from hinvan explicit assurance that he had not seen any Cabinet document,  that he had not had any communication with any Civil Servant in
connection with this matter, and. in fact that he had received no information at all either directly or indirectly except from Members of the House of Commons; and that so far as he knew such information as thev gave him. was merely their reproduction of discussions which they had had with, members of the Cabinet,I myself am satisfied that the statements made to me by Mr. Poss were true and I am prepared to accept his assurances that he, and thrcuigh him the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, are most anxious to avoid any publication which would In any way embarrass the Government or disclose anv matter which ought to be kept secret.In these circumstances I do hot think that it would be useful or desirable to take any further steps, but I circulate    this Memorandum in order that my colleagues may be aware of the action which I have taken.D.M.H.Royal Courts of Justice, STRAND. 25rd April,  1926.
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH;Box 84A.,  135,  Fleet Street, London,  E.C.4,April 20th,  1926.The Right Hon.  Viscount Burnham, My Lord,I am informed that you have received a complaint from the Government respecting an article written by me and published on April 14th on the subject of a proposed tax on betting.I have been the Parliamentary Correspondent of this newspaper for many years and am,  therefore,  well acquainted with the conditions necessary to be observed by one perforin-ing in an honourable manner the work of a political journalist.The information on which I based the article in question was obtained in a perfectly legitimate way.      It was not communicated to me,  directly or indirectly, by any member of the Civil Service or other employs of the State, and I had no access to any Cabinet document.I heard in the Lobby towards the end of February that the Chancellor of the S.-- chequer had circulated a memorandum to members of the Cabinet on the question of a betting tax, I mentioned this in a paragraph published on February 26th.On March 18th I again referred to the subject statingthat:In addressing a deputation from the Federation of British Industries last week, the Chancellor of the Exchequer touched on the question of a betting tax,  and revealed so much of his mind as to show that, the posei-bility of a Budget proposal of this character should not be ruled out.
This was a perfectly fair inference to draw from the officially issued report of Mr. Churchill&apos;s statement to the deputation.      I went on to add:There is good reason for believing that Mr. Churchill is now strongly inclined to bring forward a scheme for taxing credit betting in the offices of commission agents and. betting on racecourses.      These forms of betting are already legal,  and it is argued that if the proposal were limited in this way the objection that the State was recognising street betting would not apply.When this was written by me on March 17th,  it was the view of members who had served on the Select Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry Cautley that a tax on credit betting had become a probability rather than merely a possibility.      This fortified me in the impression I had derived from Mro Churchill&apos;s published speech.Coming to the article of April I4th,   I heard in the Lobby on the day the House of Commons reassembled after the Easter recess,  through members of the House, that the Cabinet had approved the principle of a betting tax.      I considered that the. information was likely to be reliable and recalling what I had written previously -(l) Respecting the circulation of a memorandum;(2^ The belief that such a  tax would be confined to credit betting; I wrote the article of which complaint has been made.I may add that for some weeks members of the House have been taking great interest in the question of such a tax and there has been much canvassing of the topic in the Lobby.
Using one&apos;s powers of deduction it was not difficult to piece together the article which I produced.      May I repeat that it was a perfectly legitimate piece of work and not in any way open to the suspicion of having been obtained by Illicit means; nor did I see any document - Cabinet or other.I am,  My Lord,Yours faithfully, (Sd. ) WJ. FOSS.
