BY THE CHAIRMAN, The Committee were asked to examine certain proposals by the Coal Commission as well as the Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines  (CaP0108(26))a      In addition the Committee had before them the views of the Mining Association on the Coal Commission Report, dated 17th March 1926 (CP,123 (26)).The Committee have reviewed the chief proposals which call for action by the State but no attempt has been made to examine the proposals in details      Some comment on the more Important recommendations is given below.     Broadly,  the Committee consider that the policy of the Government at the outset of the negotiations should be to express their readiness to accept the proposals of the Commission so far as the State is implicated,  and their willingness to give effect to them provided the Mining Association and the Miners1 Federation carry out the obligations severally imposed cn them and the two parties reach agreement where agreement is r&amp;quiredo      This policy, it  is suggested,  should be announced to the mine-owners and miners by the Prime Minister at the joint conference to be held on Wednesday afternoon nosrfc, March 24th, 19265 in the following form:&quot;The Government have considered with great care  the Report and conclusions of the Royal-Commission,    The conclusions reached by the Commission do not in all respects accord with views previously held by the Government and some of the recommendations contain proposals which the Government would not have desired to
advocate but for the Report.      But the Government recognise the great value of the investigations  conducted by the Commission,, and the weight  to be attached to  their unanimous conclusion, and iff those engaged in the industry, with whom alone the decision must primarily rest - agree  to accept  the Report and  to carry on the industry on tho basis  of its recommendations,  the Government for their part will be prepared to undertake such measures as may be required of the State to give the recommendations full effect..,    They hope that in that event by the co-operation of all parties it may be possible to find in the Report a lasting solution of the problem.&apos;3, The Commissions proposals in regard  to theROYALTIES .AND nationalisation of royalties in their technical aspectCOMPULSORYAIAIGA-     are being examined by another Cabinet Committee,    Our MATIONS.view generally is that while the recommendation of the(Reportpp.49-62, Report should not, at any r ate at this st age&apos; be resisted &amp; 74-84).there arc various ways and degrees in which effect  can be given to 1t,or its operation might be postponed for three or four years so as not to prejudice the important debt conversions contemplated by the Treasury,,4o The Committee referred to the Committee of CivilFUELRESEARCH Research the recommendations of the Report dealing with &amp; FURTHER IHANCIAl Research and agreed that Mr, B.

made out that the municipality could trade at a profit,  the licenses to bo periodically renewable, ii shown to the satisfaction of the Minister of Health that no l$ss v/as boing made and that only such profit was made as was necessary to provide a reserve fund which would prevent a burden on the rates.      We appointed a sub-Commit tee presided over by the Secretary for Mines to consider how best  to give effect  to those views and their Report will be found in Appendix I..Bapor t fe0104-106)COMMITTEE M EEEi&amp;L BRMJ8P0BT.7 olOMPULSOEY POSING.itepor tP.? 141-143)The Committee agree with the view expressed, by the Minister of Transport  (CP.114(26.))   that no objection need be offered to the Beeommendation to set up a Standing Joint Committee of the Ministry of Transport and the Mines Department  to deal with measures for securing larger mineral wagons,  and a greater concentration of ownership of wagons,    and they agree that its report should be made not to Parliament but  to the Minister of Transport, who should lay the Report before parliament.The Committee agree with the Commission in recognising  that the proposals for compulsory profit sharing are not likely to be acceptable to either owners or miners,      prolonged discussions will have to take place on this subject and on the allied recommendation of the Commission that the men not employed at  the face should be given a direct interest in output.

They think it right that royalties should he made to&apos; contribute to their cost by means of payment  to the Miners1   welfare Bund in the manner proposed by the Commission and accordingly reject the suggestion that the charge should fall on the colliery owners.

The Committee have heard the provisional and tentative views of the Ministry of Labour on the subject.      The cursory examination which the Committee was able to give to it sufficed  to show that any thoroughgoing attempt to assist the casualties of the coal industry may involve the State not  only in a large expenditure
on miners,  but also on those discharged from other depressed trades,  like iron,  steel and ship building, or from Government arsenals and dockyards.      On the ether hand,  it might be possible  to safeguard such a policy by requiring the coal industry to shoulder a large share of the burden.    Or again it might he preferable to undertake some general measure of alleviation,  like the provision of a large number of steel-houses, which would not  discriminate in favour of one class of unemployed.   .This matter needs much closer examination than we were able  to give it but it  is important  that the Cabinet  in considering what further financial assistance, if any,  should be extended to the industry, should bear in mind the cost  of giving effect to this portion cf the Commission1s Report and to the fact.that the recommendation assumes the immediate cessation of the present subsidy.S.B.-2,  Whitehall Cardens,  3.W.I. 80th March 19 26.
A?PEEDIX I.SUB-COMMITTEE OE MUNIGIPAL,TRADING IS COA^. REPORT,1.      At their meeting held on Thursday, March 18th,  1926,(R.C.C.(26) 1st Conclusions),  the Committee on the Reportof the Coal Commission decided that the question of municipal trading in ooal (Report, Chapter VIII,Organisation of Distribution), should be examined bya Sub-Committee who should be ashed to submit a reportby Monday, March  2nd,  1926.The following is the composition of the Sub-Committee:Parliamentary Secretary, Col.  the St. Hon.  G.R.Mines Department Lane-Pox, M*Po      (Chairman)Permanent Under Secretary,        Mr. E.A. Gowers,  C.B. Mines Department.Principal Assistant Mr.  P. Ashley,  0oBoSecretary, Board of Trade.Assistant Secretary, Mr,  I-Go  Gibbon, C.B.E.Ministry of Health.At the request of the Chairman Mr. J,W. Peok,  C.B. was present at the meeting of  the Sub-Committee to representthe Scottish Office.20      The Sub-Committee have considered the reoommendation of the Royal Commission that power should be given to municipalities to engage in the retail distribution of coal in competition with private merchants,  and in doing so havo been guided by the views expressed when this question was disctissed by the Committee on the Report of
1the Coal Commission (K.C.C, (26) 1st Conclusions, Minute 4) and submit the following report for consideration by   the Committee.5.     It appears to the Sub--Committae if permission is to be granted to    Local Authorities to engage in this trade that such permission should be based on one or other of the following considerations :-The Local Authorities might be required to show that local prices charged were exorbitant or that the service was inadequate.      There are, however, substantial administrative disadvantages to such a scheme and an alternative would be simply to require Local Authorities to satisfy the appropriate&amp;te Department that they could probably carry on the trade at a profit.      The Sub-Committee consider that the latter alternative is openIto the objection that Local Authorities will be enabled to enter on the trade even where no abuses in the local retail trade had been estatlished.      In conformity with the usual practice it will be necessary for the appro-priate Departmento hold a local enquiry before granting their approval to an application.      They recommend,thereforeithat permission to trade should only be given to Local authorities that can show a good prima facie case that tney will probably be able to seTl coal without loss at a price helov? that charged by the Local merchants,4, As regards the form of Government approval theff$MjHTSub-Committee understand that the licensing system is open to objection and that the written approval by the appropriate Department would be a sufficient safeguard, and would be administratively preferable * lJpL-4 l0li&apos; 5. As there is no question of granting a monopoly toLocal Authorities, the Sub-Committee do not consider that     -it -
there would be any dustification for entertaining claims fo: compensation by -Local coal merchants.INI.TIPN OffI,&quot;, &quot;   &apos;   6. The horal Couimission do not make any specific recommendation on this point, and,  in general, the Sub-Committoo consider that Local Authorities should not be permitted either to establish shops or sell to customers outside their own area, but it will happen, especially in Scotland,  that it might be desirable for a Local Authority to be  empowered to soil coal outside its area if the neighbouring Local Authority wished it to do so.The Sub-Committee recommend, therefore,That the  definition of the area should be left to he determined by the appropriate Department when the Government approval is signified,^INITIONLOCili 7. It will be necessary in the proposed legislationDHITIBS.to indicate precisely what Local Authorities will be given the right to apply tor permission to engage in this trade. It appears to the Sub-Committee that bodies such as County Councils or board of Guardians are unsuitad for this purpose,  but that this power might be properly given to Urban and Rural District Councils-The Sub-Committee recommend, therefore,That power should only be given to Urban and Rural District Councils which are the Local Sanitary Authorities throughout the country-.
SCOTLAND.IIITIIXcTpitaI8,      It will be necessary in the first legislation tohave an appropriate application clause for Scotland where the Sanitary Authorities are for the most part the Boroughs or County Districts. 9. The Sub-Committee do not apprehend thatthere will be any difficulty in Local Authoritiesobtaining the money required for the initialcapital expenditure;.      This would have to be doneon a loan basis, subject to the   specific approvalof Sinking Fund and Terms by the Central Department.DURATION 0.1?GOViJRMvlMT EMITS&quot;.10. It appears to the Sub-Committee that itwould be imposBible for the Local Authorities toobtain, on any terms, the money   iaitinlly requiredto start if they were only given a short termlicenso or permit by the Government.     On the whole,the Sub-Committee recommend that -As a general rule no specific period should be stated at the time when approval is given, but that among the conditions attached to approval should be the power by the Depart-moire to revoke such permission if they con-sidar such a courso necessary or desirable.The Sub-Goaixiitt ee thinks that this arrangement would provide adequate safeguards against abuse,while at the same time giving the Local Authoritiesa reasonable chance of conducting their ooalbus inass with succ ass.ACTUALAOGOUf m -IMITATION pJLHfOPITS,11. Provision should be made for the central department to have power to call for certified accounts when they consider It necessary.12. The Sub-Comaittoa considered thesuggestion that the amount of profit made by LocalAuthorities dealing in coal should bo limited asis iisually done whoro such Authorities supplygas,  etc.,     In the latter case, the service isa monopoly and as in the present caso the LocalAuthorities would be faced with competition-4-
by coal merchants,  there does not appear to the Sub-Committee any reason for imposing a limitation on their profits.TrfJ$B* 13. Provision will have to be made givingLocal Authorities power to acquire land for the purpose    of trading in coal.RESERVE 14. It will probably be necessary to fix aWwd&quot;.Statutory maximum for a Reserve Puna to be accumulated by Local Authorities, any surplus above that maximum being paid into the Rates Lund.APPROVINGDEPARTMENT. 15. The Sub-Committee recommend -That the Approving Department for application by Local Authorities for permission to trade in coal should be rospectively the Ministry of Health and the Scottish Office, who will, of course, receive all necessary assistance and advice from the Mines DepartmentsDEFINITIONOlr&quot;&quot;CQAL0 &apos;   16. The Sub-Committee recommend -That , for the purposes of retail trade by Local Authorities, coal should be defined as including -&quot;coke and any manufactured fuel of which coal or coke is a constituent&quot;..Signed on behalf of the Committee G t H.
