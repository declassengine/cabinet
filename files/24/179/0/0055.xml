minutes of meetingHELD AT10, downing street, s.w.,ONmarch  11th,  1926.The Prime Minister met this afternoon at 10, Downing Street Mr. Evan Williams i Sir Adam Nimmo, Mr. Crawshaw, and Mr. W. A. Lee, of. the Mining Association, and Mr. Herbert Smith, Mr. Thomas. Richards, Mr. W. P. Richardson, and Mr. A. J. Cook, of the Miners&apos; Federation. The following verbatim report of the proceedings is issued for the information of the Press.The Prime Minister : Gentlemen, first of all I want to thank you for any trouble you have been put to in coming here to meet me this afternoon. I felt that as the last time we met was the occasion on which I intimated to you the setting up of the Coal Commission, so my first act when the Report of that Commission was presented should be to see you and report formally that they had completed their labours and just make one or two observations that I feel to be desirable at this moment. I am sure you realise ihe enormous biirden of responsibility that rests on me as the head of the Govern -ment. My responsibility has been this. I have caused the subsidy to be paid, and I am responsible for the setting up of the Commission itself, a very weighty responsibility, and in the same way there is a great responsi-bility on all of you who sit opposite to me. The coal industry has been a difficult one for many years, and the struggles which have taken place in it havie reacted very gravely at times on the life of the whole country, so we all of us sitting in this room have upon us to-day a very serious responsibility. Now the sense of that responsibility I rejoice to think has been shown by the two state-ments which you both made to the Press last night, and I wish to thank you for them. It would have been easy to have been less guarded in expression than you were, and had you been less guarded I think that it might have caused very serious difficulties at this moment. The publica-tion of those two serious and statesmanlike communications has really anticipated what I intended to say to you to-day. I regret very much that ;.in one or two cases unnecessary comment has been made by individuals who long before they could have possibly studied, as it deserves to be studied, the contents of the Report have given expression to opinions already. I think that is a great mistake. It is a question on which a hasty judgment seems to me impossible. I am not expecting the Cabinet to make a hasty judgment, partly because of the responsibility that rests upon them, partly because of the difficulty and the complexity of the various questions that are involved in the Report where. Government action is suggested. I answered a private notice question in the House of Commons half-an-hour
ago in which I said that I had requested the members of the Cabinet t study the report with great care during the week-end with a view to arriving later at conclusions on the various points where they would have to come to decisions. I think that what is true of the Cabinet is equally true of you It is incumbent on all of us because, after all, there is a much larger public involved to-day than is represented by the shareholders in the mines or by the miners, or by the Government; there is the country as a whole and according as we may act, together or separately, we may do a good, deal either to help or to hinder the prosperity of the country. Peelinn that, I would ask you, and this was really the object of inviting you to come here this afternoon, to give your most earnest consideration and study to that Beport and not to be in too much of a hurry to jump to conclusions upon it. Even a few days at this time of careful consideration and delibera-tion may be worth a great deal to us later on. Let us all study it with a sense of judicial temper and a sense of the responsibility that I am sure, quite sure, every one of us feels. If there is any help that can come fromi this side of the table, either trom the Ministry of Mines or myself, it is at your service at any time, but just for the moment and in these early days I do beg of you to give, as I think you will give, that same care and deliberation and judicial temper to your study of this most difficult question as the Government axe going to give. That was really all I wanted to say to you this afternoon and I thank you very much for coming here (as I said at the beginning I know it must have been at personal inconvenience) to hear these very few words of mine. But I do feel it so intensely that I thought I should have been failing in my duty if before we got to the consideration of these matters I had not made my mind quite clear to you. That is all I want to say. I would deprecate any discussion this afternoon. I do not wish to raise any question because frankly I find, in my study of these matters in the little time I have been able to give to it up to now, I am not in a position to offer any opinion or to enter into any discussion. I do not think really there is need for us to prolong this meeting because I am quite sure what I have said is what must be in the minds of all at this table.Mr. Evan Williams : May I say just a word or two in thanks to you for having called us together this afternoon to express to us your views upon this matter. I do not think I need say how great the responsibility is that we feel rests upon us, and I think we on our side welcome very heartily indeed the expression of opinion you have given us in regard to the study and close study, close deliberation, which ought to precede even any discussions between the two sides upon a matter of this kind. We have on our side a very large body of people, many of whose whole means in the world may depend upon the results of such discussions and negotiations and arrange-ments as may be made, and up to to-rnorrow morning we do not suppose that the coalowners in the country generally will have had an opportunity of even seeing the Beport. On our side we feel it is necessary not only that those of us who are more in the public eye and have been taking an active part in dealing with the questions before the Commission should have a hill opportunity to study the document, but that all those whom we represent throughout the country should have the same opportunity, and we can assure you that all you have said accords entirely with our view, that any undue haste at the present moment may prolong rather than shorten the period of suspense.Mr. Herbert Smith: I would like to say, Mr. Prime Minister, in as few words as possible, that it has been no trouble to us to come because we always feel we are under an obligation to come and meet you, as Prime
3570Minister, or any other gentleman that holds a similar position, whether we acrree with his polities or not. We feel that is obligatory on us. As to giving this due consideration, I take &quot;it that ^devolves on everybody,1 arid: I do know that our people&apos;s lives do depend upon this industry, as to what will be done for it, more than those of our friend, from the   s. d. point of view. We have been spending the day to-day at it. We intend spending the clay to-morrow, and we may spend some more days yet, and the oonse-quence is that we shall give it as much consideration as possible, and we shall consider it in all its aspects, but I think we rather look upon it like this, the question rests between you and the owners largely as to what you are going to say about this Eeport and as to its results. I have no strong opinions yet until I know what decision you will make.The Prime Minister: That is exactly what we are considering, and what I intimated must take time. I do not mean a long time, but owing to the gravity and the number of questions to be considered, it must be some clays any way.Mr. Herbert Smith : I want to say that we are thankful to you for inviting us here because it may be that you might have checked some mis-understanding on our part, or we may have checked some in your mind, and between the three of us we may make a good job of it.The Prime Minister : I thought at the beginning of what must be a very protracted and difficult time it would be well for us just to meet together round the table and just have some intimation of the spirit, at any rate, in which we are going to begin these negotiations. I am very much obliged to you for coming.10, Downing Street, 11th March, 1926.

DEPUTATION to the PRIME minister from the Mining Association of Great Britain and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain,, on WEDNESDAY, 24th MARCH, 1926 .  .   .Present : The Rt. Hon. STANLEY BALDWIN, M.P. The Rt. Hon. Sir ARTHUR STEEL MAITLAND, M.P. Colonel G. R. LANE-FOX, M.P.Members of the Mining Association of Great Britain Mr. Evan Williams. Sir Adam Nimmo. Mr. Crawshaw. Mr. Lee.Members of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain Mr. Herbeet Smith. Mr. Richards. Mr. Richardson. Mr. A. J. Cook.The Prime Minister, : To-day I do not expect to take up a good deal of j your time, but I should like to begin by thanking both parties that are here this afternoon for the way in which they responded to an appeal I made last time. I am quite sure that whatever may happen to our deliberations it has been a great thing that the whole matter has been treated in the country with a sense of responsibility and without undue excitement. I think that is worth a good deal.Since we met, the Government have been very carefully considering the many points which arise in the report. We have had a good many meetings on the subject and a good many discussions, and I am quite clear that the first thing to do is to tell you, as the two parties interested, the Governments attitude as regards the report. I have had it written out in the form in which the Cabinet authorised me to convey it to you and I will give you all copies of it. I think it is quite obvious that this must be published. I will read it to you : &quot; The Government have considered with great care the Report and conclusions of the Royal Commission. The conclusions reached by the Commission do not in all respects accord with views held by the Government and some of the recommendations contain proposals to which, taken by themselves, the Government are known to be opposed. Nevertheless, in face of the unanimous report of the Commission and for the sake of a general settlement the Government for their part will be prepared to undertake such measures as may be required of the State to give the recommendations effect, provided that those engaged in this industry with whom the decision primarily rests agree to accept the Report and to
571carry on the industry on the basis of its recommendations.   It is our hope that in that event, by the co-operation of all parties, it may be possible to find in the Report a lasting solution of the problem.&quot; If I may put the whole of that into one sentence, it is that we accept the Report provided the other parties do so.Mr. Evan Williams : I do not know whether you are expecting us to say anything to-day-The Prime Minister : I do not want anyone to speak to commit himself before he has had an opportunity of considering the position of the Government and consulting his friends, but I thought it right that as soon as possible we should make you acquainted with the decision we have come to. I do not know that as far as I am concerned there is anything I want to ask you. There is one question you might consider among yourselves if you would be good enough to, if you are happy enough to come together, that is the question on which I should like some assistance from both of you, the question about recruitment in mines. Whether it would be of assistance to the mining industry if recruitment from outside for a term of two or three years or something like that should be stopped, and only to allow men to be taken on who are miners ; that is to say, whether it would help the unemployment in that particular industry to stop recruitment from say agricultural labour. I do not want any answer on that, but it is a subject on which I should like some advice from those who are interested in it. I notice it is a suggestion that has been made, I think it was done in the war. There is at the moment, and I think there must be for a time a considerable amount of surplus labour which has been trained in the mining industry and it is a question whether it is wise to allow that labour to be out of work in cases where it can be employed in other parts of the country, but where other labour which is new to mining is taken on. I cannot remember the extent to which that is touched on in the Report, but I have in my mind that it does refer to the question of some possible assistance being given to move miners from one part of the country to another and the two questions are rather involved.Mr. Evan Williams : The Report does deal rather fully with that and gives figures.The Prime Minister : I think the Report does deal with that and it is a question which has been brought to my notice. I think that is the kind of subject where we should value very much a considered judgment from both sides.Mr. Evan Williams : There are two kinds of labour that are new to mining that have been employed. There are the boys who have never worked at all and people who have never worked in the industry before although they may have worked in some other occupation so there are two aspects in it.The Prime Minister : There is a distinct line of demarcation between the two. I do not want to go into the merits of it now, but I should be glad to have the view of the Association and the Federation on that because that is the kind of thing, if that would be a real help, I should be prepared to legislate on for a time.Mr. Evan Williams : you had not in your mind any question of separating the two or of putting the two together ?The Prime Minister : No, I want to hear your views on it.Mr. Evan Williams : There is the juvenile labour and there is the adult.The Prime Minister : That is right; they are quite different. The miner&apos;s son would naturally want to work with his father and prima facio
that is a case where one would not like to interfere. In regard to adults that is different and prirna facie that seems not to be an unreasonable thing to do but 1&apos;should like to have the views of both sides on that.Mr. Evan Williams : As far as we are concerned we should be finite prepared to consider the question and possibly to exchange views with the other side.The Prime Minister : That is what I ask because if it were desirable to do anything and if there were a common agreement it makes it so much easier to deal with it.Mr. Evan Williams : Upon the statement of the Government on the main position, I do not think we on our side are prepared to say anything at the moment.The Prime Minister : I do not expect it, I hope you will be good enough to discuss it and will consider it very carefully. It lay with us to give the answer first and we have been working very hard to achieve it. I may say there has been considerable reluctance to indicate an acceptance except in the hope that it may be of material help to what we all desire, and that is, to come to an end of these disasters in the coal trade which have done so much not only to damage the coal trade, but what is a still bigger thing, the industry of the whole country.Mr. Herbert Smith : Take these words &quot; The Government for their part-will be prepared to undertake such measures as may be required of the State to give the recommendations effect,&quot; does that cover them all and are you going to prepare Bills to submit to us to embody these proposals ?The Prime Minister : That is what it means in the long run. It would be difficult for me to-day to be drawn into details because honestly I have not had the time yet to consider details. It would be difficult for me to tell you how quickly, for instance, it would be possible to cover these points. I have set up committees already to deal with a good many of the more difficult matters in the report. I have set up an extraordinarily strong Committee which is taking under its view all the questions in the report that deal with research. All I would say to you to-day is this ; this is not meant to draw wool over anybody&apos;s eyes. It is as plain a statement as we can make, and we are putting all our cards on the table perfectly bona fide ; we do not want to bargain, and we do not want to trick. My position, I am sure you will recognise, at a preliminary meeting like this is a little more difficult in some respects even than your position and Mr. Evan Williams. You cannot well give an answer on many points until you have consulted your colleagues, and with the best good-will in the world if you will give me an answer here to-day on any point, supposing I asked it, you could not undertake that the answer you gave would be adopted and ratified. If I speak and say anything my word goes you see and it will be done, and it is a very responsible position the head of the Govern-ment is in in that way because it gets out and he commits the Government, and therefore to go into any question of detail at the moment would bo difficult for me. We had to work very hard to get this, and it means if we get an agreement we will fulfil our part of the bargain.Mr. Herbert Smith : I think, Mr. Prime Minister, that we have known you long enough to respect you and when you make a statement we take notice of it, but our people query it.The Prime Minister : I stand by this.Mr. Herbert Smith : I would like to ask you another question. Does this mean that you leave owners and ourselves to settle in any way we can ? In the report the subsidy ends on the last clay of April. Is the Government not going to give any further help to the industry ?
7572The Prime Minister : This is a question that i expected, and i think it is best at a meeting like this it comes back to what I said a minute ago  I want to put all my cards on the table and I want to avoid any appearance of bargaining of any kind. You have raised a question, Mr. Smith, on which the Commission has expressed a very definite opinion, that question of further help, and I have just announced to you that the Government are prepared to stand by the report, and the report itself, as you know, involves a good many problems requiring money. That we shall all be agreed upon. The subsidy comes to an end on the 30th April, and it must come to an end. The country has had to pay an enormous sum of money, borne by the general taxpayer, for the benefit I am not complaining about that, I am just giving you the facts -of one single industry. That is that. But I recognise and I must recognise, that in some districts, if a settlement is to be arrived at, the sacrifice that may be required must be heavy, and if an agreement can be reached by the 1st May, I shall be willing to consider what temporary assistance may be required to ease the position, but this would be a departure from the recommendations of the Commission to that extent; and that being so, it must be plain that any money that may be employed for that purpose must be considered, in relation to money that may have to be spent under the other recommendations of the Commission. Now by that I am not trying to dodge out of anything, I am merely pointing out that the amount of money that can be available in the present state of the country&apos;s finances cannot be unlimited, and to a certain extent it must be a question of whether we can do it or not, and if against the advice of the Commission we found that some such temporary assistance, say for three months as has been done before, were going to save the situation, then I would be prepared to consider departure from the strict ruling of the Commission, and I should regard it that money spent in that way was spent for the benefit of the industry. That is as far as I can go to-day. It is much fairer to say all that I have in my mind on the subject to-day than say &quot; No, we cannot consider it,&quot; and many people take the view that you would be more likely to get to work in that event. I want to tell you all that is in my mind, and that is the view that I hold, and which the Government hold.Mr. Herbert Smith : I hardly agree that this has been for the benefit of this industry, and I think every industry has benefited by it. Last year you asked us for a subsidy to encourage other trades to get away. Now I suggest to you that the subsidy has been to the benefit of other trades. I want you to look at it from that point. There is a serious gap between that and the economic position of the industry.The Prime Minister : There are some other trades with a serious gap which they have never been able to make up.Mr. Herbert Smith : Shall we be able to get some of these Bills at an early time to see what they are embodying, because there are some important things in this report which, if properly handled, may put the industry into a different position to what it is in now, and we want to try and find what is at the back of your mind, what it means as to reorganisation and other questions ?The Prime Minister : Well, of course, I should get on to work as though you were going to get an agreement, but there is a great deal of work, lying before us now, and we are losing no time in regard to it.Mr. Cook : This statement is very short and vague as to what is implied.The Prime Minister : I do not think it is at all vague.Mr. Cook : You say that you will accept the report and introduce legislative measures necessary to carry out the findings, but what sortfof legislative measures ? -.
The Prime Minister : I think it is clear if. you look at it again_&quot; toundertake such measures as may be required of the State to give the recom-mendations effect.&quot; I am dealing here with the report as it affects the Govern-ment. It is not for me to say anything about the report from any other point of. view. The first point is whether the Government accept the report as a whole or not without exceptions. If we had taken up the line that some parts of the report be accepted and some parts, which many of us do not like wore not accepted, there would be no prospect of finality, because it is perfectly . obvious then that other parties would say they like something here which we do not, and we pick and choose, so we try to do something to help both parties by saying we do accept the report, and we will do our part in implementing what is in the report if the other parties do the same.i; Mr. Cook : The point I put is as to what are the interpretations the Govern-&apos; ment put upon the recommendations contained therein, the shape of them.&apos; We are not asking an unreasonable thing. One thing you can say &quot; I accept,&apos;&apos; but what is the form, what method is adopted ?   Supposing I was to say now&apos; as to what the report recommends in regard to the Pit Committees what do you mean by that ? The whole thing is vague from that point of view. lam not doubting your intentions, but we would like to say this ; you would be the last to buy a pig in a poke, to use a familiar phrase ; possibly you have not made up your mind on the points of interpretation.The Minister of Labour, : Does it not mean this ? So far as the matters in the report one cannot go into detail but so far as they need administra- I &apos; tive action, it means being prepared to take that administrative action. There are definite recommendations right through the report asking the Government to do certain things. It means that some of them can be done by administra-tion without passing fresh laws, some would mean fresh legislation. So far as it means administrative action the Prime Minister will correct me if I am wrong it means we are prepared to take administrative action, so far as it I means legislation, we are prepared to get the Bills ready and to take legislative M action. It must take some time, and I cannot commit myself at the moment, fj but I am in this position, if jointly between you you arrive at an agreement, I but you ask for something to be varied, then the Government, at your joint I request, if you come to agreement, will be prepared to consider that. If you come to agreement it will be ready to go ahead on the administrative or legislative action which the report recommends. I have tried to put it as clearly as I can, but I want to get cleraly what it is that Mr. Cook asks.The Prime Minister : The form of legislation of course does want a good : j deal of consideration as everybody knows who has to prepare a Bill, and that is work we must get along with now, and we shall not lose any time over that, and it wall be our business to move along with that as fast as we can, while you, I hope, will be moving along with your work. Wo shall be in touch all the time, and obviously it will be the duty of the Minister of Labour to be in consultation with both sides on a number of matters that are in the report. It is impossible, to-day to give you more than I have given you here.&quot; The Minister of Labour: I think what Mr. Cook means, if I understand what he and Mr. Herbert Smith have said, is that ii the Mining Association and the Federation are meeting together in order to discuss their side or the question, whether they can rest assured that the Government are going on getting into shape quite generally without any humbugging or putting off or evasion the steps put forward to the Government to take.Mr. Richardson : It means until we do see set out in the form it is necessary to set it out in the proposed Bills we cannot know whether we agree with the interpretation of the report.   We may have a difference on the report.  In
95other words, a construction may be put on the words of the report that may be different from what we think, and therefore not of much use.The Minister oe Labour : Would it not in that case be quite right and ijroper that either the Federation or the Association should come back to us and say, &quot; What meaning do you put on this, because we want to know on this, that or the other recommendation.&quot; That neither side should delay their consideration as between you two until perfection has been achieved, or rather&apos; can be achieved, and everything can be got ready on the other side, and you can come back and go into any question of doubt as to the attitude to be adopted.Mr. Cooic : You say a &apos;&quot; doubt &quot; on what ? We have nothing at the moment tangible to have our doubts about. As you said, there are a number of questions that require legislative action, others that are administra-tive which are subject to agreement on both sides. Well, surely with so much involved, such changes involved to both sides, involving a great body of men, I do not know whether it is right for us to be suspicious, what can we say from this, what is the form of your interpretation of the recommendations. A short schedule can be prepared on the items that require both administrative and legislative action particularly on your side. That is not asking too much before anything tangible is arrived at.The Prime Minister : I see what you mean.The Minister or Labour : I do not see why they should not come back to us on any points as they come up.Mr. Herbert Smith : I am not questioning your honesty, but you have shoved us into a siding that is going to have a dead-end. Until we know what is going to be done we cannot discuss anything with the owners, you have shoved us into a siding. We will keep in touch with your people, and you ought to give us a lead, Mr. Prime Minister, as to your intentions on your side. I am looking at the 30th April, it is not.a long way away. Unless we are active we are going to do harm to everybody.The Prime Minister : What was it exactly, Mr. Cook, that you wanted, because we do not want to see a Bill on every subject in detail. They take an enormous time to prepare. The recommendations, of course, are very clear. I should have thought this opening statement of mine was very clear, but if there is anything we can clear up fairly quickly for you we would be very glad to try and do it. Of course, we have not got unhmited time before us. I have brought you to-day what I thought was a clear statement giving our attitude. We have not yet heard anybody else&apos;s attitude towards the Report.Mr. Cook : Well, sir, surely it is not asking anything impossible, seeing you have considered this in some detail, to give us a short memorandum, not the whole Bill but a short memorandum on the points which you have in your mind, both legislative and administrative, and the method of application. I will just give you an instance. If we were asked a question on this, as to one point they would say what does it mean. They would say to our President on the Pit Committees for the establishment of obligatory profit-sharing schemes  what do you mean about that ? I should have to say, I do not know anything about it.   It is a pig in a poke for us.The Prime Minister : Just a word on that. That again is a thing which is mentioned in the Report. That is a subject that would require a good deal of investigation with you and with the owners. We have not got the experience yet on that particular subject to know what is the wisest thing to do.   We have got to hack something out.
......Mr. Cook : But how can we ?   Again I say it to Sir Arthur Steel Maitland.You may talk it over between yourselves. Let us have a formula or a resolution to talk to, on the subject matter under discussion. Surely we are only asking for that in a proper business way ?Colonel Lane-Fox : Talk it over together and see if there are any points of agreement.Mr. Herbert Smith : Mr. Prime Minister, we are going to make a serious blunder here to-day. The first thing is we have your views on paper, what you intend doing. The next thing we expect is what the owners have got to say. It is fair that they should tell us their position, somewhere else if not here, because I can see us standing to attention until the 30th April. We are business men. I think the first thing we have to get is a iDronouncement from you people in detail in answer to the simple question Mr. Cook put about the Pit Committees, that you should not go away from the 1920 Agreement. If you do not, there is nothing in it. The next thing is, is there to be re-organisation of the industry. How are we going to know your minds ? We had to tell you in 1925, last year, that we would not be responsible for the chaotic condition the industry was in ; we are still in that position. We want to help. If you decide against nationalisation I am not going to try and make it an industry that will not pay. Whether it is private enterprise or otherwise, as long as I am in that business I am going to do my share to make it a success. I will still work for nationalisation, but I am not going to sit still until I get it.(At this Point of the Proceedings, 5-20 p.m., the Prime Minister and his Colleagues Withdrew. 1The Conference resumed at 5-50 p.m.The Prime Minister : Well, gentlemen, I have been thinking over what you have said very carefully. You see the Government have gone a long way, a long way, to-day, and neither of you have gone any way at all. I do not blame you for that because I did not expect you to, and it is not the time to do so. But we have, and I am sure that Mr. Cook does not mean that he wants details of Bills before doing anything on his part. That, I think, would be an unreasonable request. I recognise the anxiety that has been expressed, because there have been failures in the past, and we are bound to find a certain amount of soreness and a certain amount of prejudice, but I cannot imagine anything at this moment much clearer than the statement I have read, and we are going on on the assumption that the Federation are going to come to an agreement with the Association on the lines of the report. We have to make that assumption at the moment to go on with the work in hand in examining the Bills that will be required, and get some estimate as far as we can of how much material will be in that, and the time likely to be taken in their passage. All that is our business. As I said before, I have committees at work now on that very subject, examining all the questions, both the very complicated ones and the comparatively simple ones, and in plenty of time before the 30th April, I shall know quite clearly the amount of Bills that will be necessary to implement our pledge, on the assumption that you can come to an agreement. If you do not come to an agreement, then of course an entirely new situation arises. The pledge we have given is on the assumption that you do come to an agree-ment, but really, gentlemen, the ball is with you now. We have to remember that beyond the 30th April the subsidy in its present form cannot go on, and whatever financial assistance may be given is expressed in the terms which I have already read to you, and if progress is to be made it is absolutely essential that you should get together without a momenfs delay.   You will be doing
11574your work on the one side, we shall be doing ours on the other, and doubtless we shall be in frequent communication and with regard to many of the things that are in the report there are some that you would only have to&apos; discuss between yourselves, there are others which must be discussed between both the Federation and the Association and the Government. The question that Mr. Cook raised about profit sharing is a most difficult and intricate subject, and that is one that primarily must be solved by consultation of the people who have full knowledge and interest in the question. But I do not want to go into any details at this moment. This is hardly the time, and we have none of us had the amount of time for preparation necessary to enable us to speak on all these things. I do hope that we can get to work in a spirit of trying to get to an agreement, and dismiss from our minds what I completely dismissed from mine, any idea of trying to manoeuvre for position, or do anything like that. I have put all my cards on the table, I have told you frankly what we can do, I have told you that the Government accept the report, and I have given you my undertaking that we will carry out such things in the report as call for Government action on the condition that you two parties can come to an agreement. As i say, before you come to the 30th April we shall then know exactly the amount of legislation that will be necessary, and more or less the form that it will take. There will be plenty of time before you put your signatures to anything to see that, and if you are so happy as to put your signatures to any agreement we shall know then we shall be free to go on as quickly as we can. I have been very frank to-day, and even what I have been able to say to you has been the result of a great deal of work and a great deal of thinking, and I think now without a doubt it is up to you to get a little bit of a move on to try and compensate me for the very considerable move i have managed to get on with my Government.Mr. Smith : Is not that rather putting us into the position that this is a bargaining question ?The Prime Minister : I do not think so. I have no idea of that in my mind at all.Mr. Smith : I want to put it to you that you have appointed this Corn-mission, and I take it the Government is prepared to accept the report of the Commission, that apart from whether the one or other differs the Government would go on with its business, would it not ?The Prime Minister : What do you mean exactly ?Mr. Smith: If you. say, &quot; We will adopt this subject to you people settling,&quot; that seems to be a bargaining position.The Prime Minister : In that sense of bargaining, you may say the whole Report is. You cannot expect me to make my party swallow a lot of things they do not like if there is going to be a general stoppage in this country that is going to reduce its financial power far below what it is to-day.Mr. Smith: I may be wrong, but I think I could expect you to adopt this procedure, that having appointed the Commission you are going to abide by the findings of that Commission irrespective of either party. There are plenty of things in this Report that we do not like.The Prime Minister: That is why I say there are a lot of things we do not like. If we all swallow this Report we are doing it for the sake of peace. We are all going to swallow what we do not like. My job is to get a great party to endorse what I am going to put before them, and if we are going to carry out this Report we have all got to do that, there is no question about that.   We are all going toi have a lot of men amongst those who are
our supporters who will not like a good deal that is in the Eeport, there is no question about it. I am sure it is the ease with you and with the owners and with me.Mr. Smith : Does not that put us exactly in the position that we want to know what interpretation is put on this Eeport ? That is the conse-quence. You may say, &quot; I agree with you, Smith, in principle on certain things,&quot; but when we come to details we may be far apart.The Prime Minister : I have gone a good long way to-day in explaining my position, and, as I have just explained to you, we are now getting along as fast as we can. We have wasted no time, we have been working on this, we are now getting along at the legislation that would be required.. Before a signature is affixed we shaU know quite nearly enough exactly what legislation will be required. If anyone feels that legislation or such legisla-tion is not satisfactory to them, they are not obliged to sign anything.Mr. Cook : We do not know at all your interpretations, and we accept in good faith-The Secretary for Mines : They are clear enough.Mr. Cook : I could put to you at least twelve questions straight off that 1 am not clear on as to how they are going to be applied, and I suppose the owners can do the same.The Prime Minister : Are not those just the things we must study between ourselves? There are several points in the Report where it will be of the greatest value before you decide on the ultimate form in which a Bill may be passed to consult both the Association and the Federation, and that is part of the work that I want us to get on to at once without any delay, but if we utilise the time we have plenty of brains to get along and do the business, but do not let us hang back for one another. I have gone a long way, as I think anyone will admit, in the short time by the Govern -ment as a whole accepting the Report and pledging itself to implement the recommendations.Mr. Cook : That means that your colleagues in the Cabinet understand the implications and the interpretations of that Report?The Prime Minister : They have given a general assent, and they will assent to legislation.Mr. Cook : It is quite evident that they have got to the stage that they know the interpretations.   We do not know your interpretations.The Prime Minister : They cannot yet know details of Bills. If you have a Report to Study, you may give a good deal of study to it and you may say &quot; Yes, I will accept this, and will give legislation to give effect to this,&quot; but you want to think a bit to see what would be the best way to give effect to it.   That cannot be done in five minutes.Mr. Bichardson : Is not the implication from the fact that you appointed the Commission, that you appointed it for the purpose of making recommendations, and could not we expect that you would adopt the Beport of your own Commission, or why did you appoint them?The Prime Minister : It is very clear that at the time the Comimission was appointed they were appointed to investigate a whole lot of subjects in connection with the industry, and to try, if they could, to show us in what way it was possible to get out o  the impasse in which we found ourselves last August.   They have made a number of recommendations, recommen-
575dations to you, to the owners, and to us. I say at this stage that if the other parties accept the recommendations of that Report, I -do. I think that is very straight and very fair, and no one else has told me anything, but I do not ask them to do so this afternoon.Mr. Richards : We want you to put yourself in our place at this moment when we have a conference of 200 or 300 delegates who want to know. We may have perfect faith in what you say, but that is all we would have. We are obliged to ask them to have faith in the Prime Ministers state-ment that the Government are going to accept this Report. I agree with you you cannot give details at the moment as to how it is to be done, but it is possible to enumerate the things in the report that you are going to deal with. For instance, you have told us you have several Committees considering different phases of the report. You mentioned research. Is it not possible to give us an outline of the matters arising from the report which require legislation and to say you are going to take the necessary steps to legislate upon those, and where the Ministry of Labour said there are some things that can be done by administration. You might also set cut those things and say you are going to deal with them by Government administration. That is about the least that we can hope for when we go to meet our men, to have something intelligible to say to them, to say, &quot; Here is research; they are adopting the Commission^ Report and going into rather more detail as to what should be done.&quot; There is very little difficulty in that. &quot; If the report is accepted as a whole, they say exactly what should be done. There are other subjects which are not set out in that detail, but which will require legislation before they can be put into opera-tion.&quot; It is because we feel ourselves to be in a difficulty; it is not that we want to be captious.The Prime Minister : No, no.Mr. Richards : We are visualising to-morrow morning.The Prime Minister : You asked me to put myself in your position. &quot;Put yourselves in my position. What a short time has gone by. I made to the Government the statement I have made to you, which I think is a very big statement to start with. The first thing, and the necessary thing, for us now really is for The two parties most interested to get together. Nobody wants to delay that, because time is short and there is a great deal to be done. We have a great deal to do. We shall be busy all through Easter and right awiay as hard as we can go. We are going on in perfect good faith, and with no idea of drawing the wool over anybody&apos;s eyes. We are going forward straightforwardly on the statement I have mentioned here.The Minister of Labour : May I give one sort of instance which may perhaps meet the views. We are all talking here quite openly. Take the question of research. The Government have set up a Committee which is at this moment going into the question of the constitution of the suggested Fuel and Power Committee and Research. The Report suggests that. The Report does not suggest all the details of how it should be composed, but) they do suggest that the question should be gone into. They suggest such a Committee, and they suggest things in regard to research, but they do not give every detail. What the Prime Minister has already done is to set up a Committee to go into that recommendation and to see how to give it actual form.The Prime Minister : It has begun to sit.The Minister of Labour: That has been sitting already. It cannot really work out the form of the thing and all that in a minute.
Mr. Eichards : No. -:&apos; The^RiMB&apos;Minister :; It all takes trouble. Mr. Richards: We accept that.The Minister of Labour : There is also a Committee going into the question of royalties. We are going into all these things simultaneously so a,s to see how they cam be given effect to and the proper form for giving effect to them. That cannot be done in a, day. There are all these points one after the other. I have just enumerated two of the main points. I can only s&apos;ay that they are working pretty hard. We have to get down to the actual shape of the thing, the way in which effect can be given to it. That is how the Government has accepted it, and accepted it as the Prime Minister has said, with every wish to give effect to it. Does not that make it clear?Mr. Eichards : Yes&apos;, if you went on with all the other subject that are the subject of recommendation in this Report. In principle you say those are the recommendations and you aire now considering the details for the purpose of putting them into operation.The Prime Minister : Every recommendation.Mr. Richards : There should be the same kind of information on every recommendation, that the Government are accepting them and are pro-ceeding either to legislate or to make the necessary administrative prepata-tions.Mr. Cook: What about a schedule? &quot; Such measures as are in the following schedule.&quot;   Surely that is not asking too much?Mr. Richards : The silent partner has to be taken into account in this. We do not know what they are going to tell us.The Prime Minister : Do you mean something like this : &quot; The following are the recommendations which are now being examined &apos;&apos; ?Mr. Cook: &quot; Such measures as are in the following schedule,&quot; or some-thing following on the lines suggested there. Mr. Richards has put the point. We have to meet to-morrow 20 of our men, each of whom has as great a responsibility as we have. Secondly, we shall have to meet and it is not an easy task on our side a great body of men, each of whom will put his own particular point of view.The Prime Minister : I have had experiences like that when meeting a body of men in the House of Commons who are very much opposed to my view.Mr. Cook : And you do it well.The Prime Minister : I stand up to them.Mr. Cook : It is all right when you have the majority on your side. You have the majority to start with, and there is the difference between us. You have something in black and white. It is not Cook&apos;s interpretation; It is not Smith&apos;s interpretation, but the Governments interpretation.The Minister of Labour: I would only give the sort of instance, and I am sure the Prime Minister would agree that it does not really, if I may say so&apos;, take away the obligation which rests on the Federation and the Association that the ball is now with them. You asked as to what the Government are doing. I have told you about research. The next is the Fuel and Power Committee. We have a committee going into that ques-tion. The same is true of the next recommendation. We are now con-sidering the suggested system of official sampling and analysis.   That means
consultation. As regards the suggestion that local authorities should be empowered to engage in the retail sale of coal, the system of that: is being considered at the same time by another committee and so on, right through the whole of those recommendations. You can get them; they are enumerated one after the other.Mr. Richardson : The Prime Minister says to us that we have got to provide legislation for certain things; there are other provisions which would have to be carried out by administrative departments. There are others you have to deal with. Has the Government scheduled those for their own satisfaction; and if they have, can they give us a copy of what they have scheduled ?The Minister of Labour : The answer is that we have a list of what the Government has to do, and we are going into those matters, but I am quite sure that I think that is all you can ask the Government at the present stage. They have got to work out all of those. As the Prime Minister said, the ball is really now at your feet, knowing that we are working those out in order to give effect to them&apos;, and the Prime Minister has given his general pledge which embodies all that. Really the ball now lies with you and with the Association to get together on it.Mr. Herbert Smith&apos;: I cannot agree that the ball is at our feet at all. The ball is between you two, and we want it to show itself. We must get to that. The House is expected to break up on the 1st April and to resume on the 13th, and we think that you two people ought to tell us where you stand.The Minister of Labour : It is for all of us. Mr. Cook : The declaration is yours.Mr. Richards : It is not as if we were the Government to decide. We have always to make preparations for well in South Wales, for instance, I know the number over 400 branches, 400 different sets of men who will want to consider anything that is put up to them in the form of a settlement either with the government or with the eoalowners, and take myself, suppose I took this document and the Report and go through it and send out to my 400 branches, which they will expect to know, the Government are going to do so and so with this, they have-accepted the Commission^ Report and they are going to legislate upon this subject. I should be bound to add some word of explanation, which may be entirely wrong when the Government come to express their views on the matter, whereas they would have the Government&apos;s document with just a few lines of explanation, and our men would then have a clear thing to consider and we should have very much less trouble.Mr. Cook : Surely that is not asking too much in view of the fact that tho report first has to operate with our men; there are two sides.The Prime Minister : I see the point.Mr. Cook : This is your part of the proposals; our friends&apos; proposals I hope we shall get to-morrow. The point is if we get proposals from you and from our friends we shall be in a position to know where we stand, at the moment we have nothing before us. You are the first people to let us know. We have nothing yet from our friends here.Mr. Evan Williams : We are meeting to-morrow afternoon.The Prime Minister : When do you meet your executive?Mr. Cook : To-morrow morning.
The Prime Minister : jWhat you want if I und.ers.tand the point you have been making, you want to see following thisi statement for the benefit of the people a schedule of the recommendations that are effective.Mr. Richards : Yes, sir, which you propose to deal with.The Prime Minister : I mean when we Say we are prepared to under-take such measures as may be required of the State to give the recommenda-tions effect, you want for the benefit of your people the recommendations put down.Mr. Richards : That is right.The Prime Minister : I cannot see any harm in that. I should not have thought it was necessary, but I see the point you have put and it is fj perfectly clear by the last part of this draft that I have put before you now that that is part of the general agreement if a general agreement is come to. Perhaps one of you would be good enough to stay behind with Mr. Jones and see him draw it up and you can take it away with you. You can do that; ail of you stay if you like. It will Save people referring to the Report which some may think difficult. I am having the report sold at 3d. a copy, j f j but I do not suppose everybody will have a copy.Mr. Richards : If I dare venture to make the observation it is important  H to the coalowners too.   Of course they resent your doing anything I know     ; but with or without resentment it is necessary to know the extent to which you do propose to deal with the matter.The Prime Minister :   Perhaps we can get am agreed Report of the meeting that has taken place to-day.Mr. Evan Williams : Is it advisable to issue anything more than your communication to us ?The Prime Minister : I like to keep these things as short as possible, but I think we can trust Mr. Cook, Mr. Lee, and Mr. Jones to do that.Mr. Cook : Everybody knows we are not here for nothing, and rather than get all the imaginary details in the Press it is better for us to get an agreed report. We never have any difficulty. Mr. Lee, Mr. Jones and myself in doing that. I take it, Mr. Prime Minister, that we shall get a verbatim report. It would be appreciated if we might have it by 10 o&apos;cloek to-morrow morning.The Prime Minister : Yes.Mr. Herbert Smith : I should like to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for spending so much time with us.(The proceedings then terminated.)

(Secretary).The Chairman : Mr. Richards and Gentlemen : As so often happens when we meet together in this room, there is some sad occurrence or other in the mining industry to which we feel it is our duty to make reference. On this occasion I think it will be the wish of all those present here that we should express, to the relatives of those six unfortunate men who lost their lives in that accident at Thome, our very sincere sympathy with them in the loss which they have sustained. I do not think I need add any other words to that, but we will put it on record. b
Lord Gatnford : I should like to be allowed to say one word in connection with this matter before you rise. The tragedy in connection with the accident at Thorne has come home to my firm with considerable feeling, and the amount of sympathy that has come from a great number of quarters has, I know given some relief to those who havo sustained the loss of relatives. The tragedy was particularly hard, because, after 17 years&apos; of sinking operations&quot; the sinking operations had been completed and the scaffold was beino- raised for the last time from the bottom of the shaft. I saw those fine fellows at work only two or three days before they lost their lives ; and I wanted to be associated specially with this resolution of sympathy to those who are suffering and mourning the loss of these men.The resolution of condolence was put to the meeting and carried sub silentio, all present standing.Mr. Thomas Rtchards : Perhaps I ought to express the concurrence of the representatives of the workmen with your expression of sympathy and also with the expression of sympathy from Lord Gainford. Whatever else we expect from the owners of the collieries, by their past conduct we have always anticipated and known that, so far as sympathy and help on disastrous occasions of this kind are concerned, we can always depend upon getting it to the full. We associate ourselves with you in the resolution that a joint expression of sympathy and condolence should be sent to the relatives of the unfortunate workmen.   (Hear, hear.)The Chairman : Mr. Richards and Gentlemen : We meet again after a lapse of several months to consider what the position of the industry in which we are all engaged is, and, I hope, with a very sincere desire to see whether we can, by putting our heads together, find some way in which we can keep this industry in a condition in which it can continue to operate and find employment for as many men as possible, and, if I may add this, to give some return to those on the other side who are so deeply interested in the prosperity of the industry  as deeply interested on the one side as on the other. -We cannot congratulate ourselves upon the position in which the industry *nds itself. It is by no means a cheerful one ; and I do not think any of us would say that it is any more cheerful at the present moment than it was when we last met together to consider the situation.I think we may take it that it is the view of all here present, for the moment at any rate, that this question is one for solution between us on both sides who are engaged in the industry. I do not know what the feeling on your side, is but on our side, at any rate, I may say that up to the present we do not feel disposed to accept the suggestions which have been made in the &quot; Daily Mirror &quot; and in the &quot; Daily Mail &quot; that Mr. Cook and I and some others on both sides should stand aside and allow some other parties to come in and try to settle between us. (Hear, hear.) I do not think we should be prepared to trust even the Editor of the &quot; Daily Mail &quot; to find a solution for us out of this difficulty that we are in.&quot;Mr. Cook : Hear, hear.The Chairman : The problem which faces us is an exceedingly grave one, and it is only by us on both sides sitting down to a serious consideration of every phase of it, and with a desire to find a solution, that I think we can have the slightest hope of emerging out of this difficulty without disaster to ourselves and to the country as a whole.T do not think I need take up any of your time at the moment in attempting to describe what is the position in the industry. It is apparent to you, I think, as it is to us.   The difficulties of it are great enough as they are; and I hove
5that nothing will be done on either side which is going to increase the difficulties with which we are faced and make it less possible to find some way out of the difficulty, which will enable us, as I have said, to carry on the industry for the future.It is, after all, primarily a matter for you and for us, and no solution of the difficulty is possible except by an arrangement between us and you. Since we met we have had a great deal of publicity given to the industry. The industry has been dissected almost piecemeal in public. We have had a Report from the Commission which was set up, which Report cannot, at any rate, be ignored by us however much we may agree or disagree with the findings of the Commission. It has, as it was bound to have, an effect upon the position. It has brought the Government into the question in a way which was not present to us in our previous negotiations in the Summer of last year ; and yesterday we on both sides were made acquainted with the decision to which the Government had come in regard to it. It has altered the situation to some extent, at any rate, and it has made it necessary for us, as probably it will have for you, to take further counsel with ourselves and with our districts before we can proceed to anything positive in the way of negotiations or deliberations.The Government has intimated that it, on its side, is prepared to accept and to carry into effect the recommendations of the Report in so far as it concerns them. Now, I think you would agree that the things which the Government have accepted conditionally and are prepared to do, provided we can come to an agreement between ourselves, are none of them things which can affect the real position which we have to face at the end of the next month. They are all of them things which require time to bring to effect, and still longer time before they can influence in any way the course of events in the industry itself as far as any practical results are concerned.So that we are, after all, brought back to a consideration of the question as it affects directly you and ourselves ; and there is nothing that can be of any help any material or any immediate help to us in the solution of these very great difficulties with which we are faced. The plain fact stares us still in the face that the industry is not in an economic position of any soundness at all as it is at present. Those questions which can have any influence at all upon the position at the end of next month, and the solution of which must be arrived at before the industry can continue to be carried on, resolve themselves into considerations of questions which must become the subject of an agreement or agreements between you and us before any real progress can be made.We are not in a position to-day to say to you definitely what our attitude is in regard to the communication which the Government has made to us. Apart from that, we have no proposals that we can put before you in regard to those questions which are entirely and completely within the control of you and ourselves, and which must be settled between us before we can put our hands to any Agreement or Agreements for the carrying on of the industry after the 1st of May.It seems to us that there is very little we can do this afternoon in the way of progress in any material sense, except to see to what extent you have anything to say upon the question, and if we can arrange a procedure by which we can get into touch the one with the other and examine closely and carefully the situation with which we are faced, and strive to arrive at some means whereby we can get the industry on to a basis on which it can be carried on. We recognise, as, I think, you must recognise, that it is only by Agreements between us and you quite apart from anything that the Government may have to do that we can hope to carry on in the future.
I do not know that I have anything specific beyond that, and I am afraid that it is not very specific in itself, for the moment. But we would intimate to you our very keen desire that we should sit down with you, either as a whole body or in some other way in which it may be possible for us to arrange, so that we may make progress in our discussions and deliberations and negotiations.We have, as I have said, to consider matters among ourselves, and we have to take counsel with our districts, and with the individual owners possibly in those districts, before we can say anything definite to you at all in any direction at the moment. Possibly your situation is somewhat similar to that. I would say no more at the moment but to suggest to you that as early as possible next week we should meet again, when we shall each have had more time to consider the questions we have to discuss, and we should meet with the express purpose of sitting down to examine closely and earnestly and with, we hope, a sincere desire to get understanding of our difficulties, and to see in what way those difficulties can be removed in order that we may, as I have said, carry on the industry in the future.One thing is absolutely necessary in the industry if it is going to prosper at all or even if it is going to be carried on that is, peace. We have had. a long series of upsets in the industry arising (shall I say ?) mainly from without, partly from within ; and we must, I think, try in our own interests and in the interests of the country as a whole to arrive, at some definite terms upon which we shall be able to carry on for a period of years and have some security on both sides of continuity of employment, of continuity of output, and as great a measure of prosperity as is possible in the unfortunate circumstances in which the coal trade and other trades in this country are placed at the moment.I do not think, Mr. Richards and Gentlemen, that I can usefully say any more than that at this moment. The only concrete proposal that we have to make to you that there are so many questions which we ourselves have to consider, and which we only can decide and settle, that the sooner we get together to discuss those questions the better for us all.Mr. Thomas Richards : Mr. Evan Williams and Gentlemen : I have, first of all, to apologise for the absence of our President this afternoon, and I have to adopt the role, I suppose, of trying to fill his place for a few moments with a few observations on Mr. Evan Williams&apos; statement.I hardly think it is necessary for me to say that we are in entire agreement with Mr. Evan Williams as to our mutual interests in this industry. Our interests must be, in the very nature of things, as important as yours, in fact, I do not think I should be exaggerating if I said more important to the men employed in the industry than to the owners of the industry. If it all went to smash to-morrow I suppose most of you would be comfortably well off for the rest of the time, but our men would have to look to something else to try and get a living. So that in that sense our interest is, if anything, greater than yours in this industry. And, having that interest, we are naturally as anxious as you are to try to keep it going.Mr. Evan Williams added a phrase to that ; he said : Try and keep it going and employ as many men as possible. I went to say quite frankly that I believe there you have gone wrong ; and there where you are going wrong, even at the present moment, is in the scramble to get as many men as possible into this industry from anywhere and everywhere.The Chairman : I did not mean to get them in from outside those who are in already.
Mr. Thomas Richards : Is not a part of our trouble due entirely to our coin&quot; on developing this industry much faster than the necessity warrants, both for this country and for exports ? I have seen it. My friends who combat us in South Wales make no bones about it at all; one of their great figures is to show to how many men it is.possible to give employment. We are concerned not so much as to how many men are employed, but how are they living when they are employed in this industry. So I cannot join with Mr. Evan Williams in what I may call his ultra patriotism. We have carried it cpiite far enough in this industry that we want to employ as many men as possible, that we want to give cheap coal to every other industry in the country, and let everyone else do other than we are doing ourselves. We really feel that that is the phase of our trouble which we want you seriously to consider.I agree that things are not very much more cheerful than they were when we met the last time ; in fact, our position, I think, is very much worse-as Mr. Evan Williams prophesied it would be - with a large number of men working short time, until very recently, anyhow ; with a great number of men unemployed ; and with the extra activities of the Government to see that we are not going to get unemployment pay. So that our position is not very cheerful at the moment. We have all the desire it is no use thinking that we have not to try and find a solution of this problem. We have really a real, sincere desire. But what we want you to do, if we can, is to try and focus your minds and energies on some other methods for once than the wages of the workman. That has been our position ; it was our position before the Government gave the subsidy and before this Royal Commission was set up. We tried our best I have no hesitation in saying it with you to ask you to explore some other avenues of looking for relief for the industry or to improve the industry ; but we failed. As a result we nearly came to a catastrophe until the Government stepped in with this Royal Commission.That ultra patriotism to which I have alluded has been emphasised by the Report of the Commission and by any Inquiry that can be made, that your workmen in the collieries are working for less wages and under worse conditions than the workmen in any other industry in this country. The Commission  and I must say this in part of its Report has endeavoured to make comparisons by taking the highly paid men, in so far as there are any highly paid men  there are some who are getting fairly high wages as pieceworkers taking their rates and comparing them with the time rates in other industries. That is a most unfair comparison to make, and one which we shall possibly have something to say about later. But, generally speaking, what has transpired as the result of this Inquiry has been to show that the workmen in the mining industry are not in receipt of the wages that are enjoyed in any other industry in the country any industry, no matter whether it is the man sweeping the streets under a municipality, or a man doing highly technical work in an engineering shop, and all the grades between ; touch it where you will and you will find that they are earning more money than the man who are working in the mines.Now with respect to the Government proposals. May I express my disappointment at the attitude adopted by your side before the Prime Minister yesterday ? It has been said that it is the man who goes ahead and does something who is subject to criticism ; and that is equally so of the man who goes ahead and says something. You will be open to no criticism for your attitude yesterday, anyhow, by having sat silent and allowed us to do our ieeblo best in trying to probe the Government. Surely that was a thing in which you might have assisted, to probe the Government as to what they meant. It may be that the little, short document which was handed to us by the
Prime Minister disclosed to yon everything that was meant ; but to our feeble minds it did not; and we wanted to know a lot more, and we were rather disappointed that we had no help from you as an expression of your anxiety to find a solution (as you say) of this problem in trying to probe every matter that was suggested in this Report which the Prime Minister was going to deal with, and find out what effect it was going to have upon us. You chose your own course. We did our best, and we did not get all that we thought wc ought to have had.I agree that in all the proposals of the Government there is no immediate relief for this industry or any complete solution of its difficulties by the end of April. But may I again say, quite good-temperedly, that you did not appear to trouble even about that. Whafs the odds about it ? There was nothing there, no proposals that could carry you on (as you say) over the end of April, as Mr. Williams has said this afternoon. Yesterday was the time to say it. Even without your saying it, the Prime Minister volunteered to say that until such times as some of these proposals do become operative until they are put into operation, anyhow; and the Government must have time to do it he did suggest some monetary relief and some other means of dealing with the workmen who might be rendered unemployed as a result of carrying on.I do not know, gentlemen, that I have much more to say, except to add that the measure of what the Government would have done, possibly the measure of what they will do, depends upon the measure of our anxiety for them to do something. If you are still adopting the attitude : Very well, there is nothing necessary to be done by the Government; all that is necessary to be done is by our workmen depend upon it you are starting upon a thorny path ; and I would ask you, before we meet you next time we accept, of course, as we always have, an invitation to come and talk about it; we will come next week or the week after or any other week to talk about it but I do seriously put it to you that to shut your eyes to any other solution, and fcr any improvements -of any kind to be ruled out, then you simply invite us to come and talk about reductions in wages, and you will be starting on a very difficult problem.I am hoping that you will give very serious consideration to the proposals put up by the Government; their offer to do something to bridge the gap that there may be between the end of April and any of the reforms they have proposed coming into operation, or any other reforms that we mutually agree upon.I close by saying that we are as anxious as you are that some peaceful solution should be found for our difficulties.The Chairman : I will say only a few words in reply to you, Mr. Richards. I do not think anything I said could be construed as meaning that we would exclude from discussion any quertions that you might raise, and much less any questions in regard to what i- Government have said they are going to do on condition that we come to an agreement among ourselves, or anything that can be done within the industry to improve the position.I do not want to enter upon any contentions discussion this afternoon, except that I think we shall endeavour to show to you that, after all, our point of view is the right one as far as this industry is concerned, and as far as the country is concerned ; and that a large volume of employment is of far greater importance to the country as well as to the industry than a small volume at a cost which must be considerably greater. This country does depend for its very subsistence upon a large output of coal-
58Mr. Thomas Richards : Then they must pay for it.The Chairman :  -and that volume does depend upon our ability tosell it and upon the ability of those who consume it or those whom we expect to consume it to sell their own goods. We are in such a peculiar position in this country that unless we can export goods we have either got to export population or have a very reduced standard of living for those who are here. I hope we shall take a longer view than that indicated by Mr. Richards. I am not arguing the question to-day, but it is a point which I do not think I ought to leave untouched in the brief reply that I am making.With regard to our attitude before the Prime Minister last night, while we fully appreciated the position in which you found yourselves of not under-standing in sufficient detail what the proposals of the Government were, we on our side felt that it was pre-eminently an occasion on which silence was golden. We felt that we could not contribute anything to the discussion. We were not expected by the Government to make any contribution to the discussion ; and we felt that until we and you had sat down together and considered the details of this position and examined our own situations mutually, there was nothing useful we could say to the Government upon the matter.I do not think I need add anything to that. If we are agreed that we should meet again at the earliest opportunity, I think you will find that some day next week Wednesday, or any subsequent day that may suit you we shall place ourselves in a position to start a discussion in detail with you upon the whole situation as it exists in substance at the moment and as it is affected, and to what extent it is affected, by the Report of the Royal Commission and by the attitude of the Government towards that Report.Mr. Cook : I take it that what you suggest is this, that after you have examined the Report of the Commission you desire to meet us. I presume from your statement you would then have something tangible to put before us, if I understand you clearly. You propose to intimate to us as to when your meeting will take place, so that we may then agree as to when you require to meet us again.The Chairman : I do not know exactly what you mean by &quot; something tangible &quot; ; but I think I can promise you that we shall be prepared to enter into a discussion of the whole situation, understand each other&apos;s point of view, and to explore the circumstances of the industry with a view of finding some way out of them. I do not think we ought to leave you under the impression that when we meet again we shall have any concrete proposals of any kind to place before you ; our view is that those ought to arise out of the discussion and out of the deliberations and examinations which we shall make of the situation together.Mr. Thomas Richards : I do not think that there is anything else we can really do to-day.The Chairman : I do not think there is, except to fix a day for our next meeting.Mr. Cook : I take it that the point is this.   It is no use fixing a day for a meeting if you are in the same position as we have been in this afternoon.The Chairman : I think I have indicated that by that time we shall have surveyed the position as it presents itself to us now, taking into consideration the Governments declaration ; and we shall certainly be able to agree with you upon the line which we should follow.Mr. Cook : You will be able to put those views before us next time we meet, I presume ?
The Chairman : When we meet next time we shall have in our minds some ideas of the lines upon which we should go. We shall suggest them to you, if we are agreed upon them, we can proceed.Mr. Cook : What day ?The Chairman; : You will remember that Friday of next week is Good Friday.Mr. Thomas Richards : We could meet on Wednesday.Mr. Cook : Yes, we could meet on Wednesday if you are meeting on Tuesday.The Chairman : Yes, we could meet on Wednesday. Mr. Cook : I suggest we meet in the morning. The Chairman : Yes, certainly. Mr. Cook : At 11 o&apos;clock ?The Chairman : Yes, at 11 o&apos;clock. Shall we agree to meet as we meet here to-day, on Wednesday morning at 11 o&apos;clock ?Mr. Cook : Yes, the full Committees will meet for the time being, at any rate.The Chairman : Very well.Mr. Cook : I take it that we shall agree upon a joint statement to the Press, to the effect that we have had a meeting and that the matter has been adjourned for further consideration ; because if we do not give them a statement they will get something out. We had better have a joint statement agreed on by the two Secretaries.The Chairman : Yes.   I suggest that Mr. Lee and Mr. Cook continue the work that they have already begun. Agreed.(Adjourned till Wednesday Morning, 31st March, at 11.)

Straker, Esq., J. E. Swan, Esq., Frank B. Varley, Esq., M.P., A. J. Cook, Esq. (Secretary).The Chairman: Mr. Smith and Gentlemen: After the preliminary canter, if I may so call it, that we had last week I hope that to-day we are now going to settle down to a business meeting. We have got a very stern, practical problem to deal with; and I think you will all agree it is one that cannot be dealt with by making speeches at one another, but by sitting down I to a close examination of the whole position. When I say &apos;&apos; sitting down &apos;&apos; ! I feel that that might apply to me as well as to the rest of you. I feel that when we do come down to discuss business closely, as I hope we shall do to-day, one can do it very much better informally sitting down than by standing up and having the appearance of addressing I will not say a mass, meeting, but a pretty large body without the reality of the business being so apparent asi it is when one sits, down informally. So if you have no objee-tion I will set the example and try to conduct the proceedings sitting, in order that we may perhaps make better progress and not have so much formality about the matter.I think there is one thing, at any rate, upon which we are all agreed, and that is that the present state of the industry is one which is well nigh I disastrous.   The coal trade of this country has got to be carried on if the country is to five; and until Parliament takes some step, which does not appear to be within range, at any rate, at the present time, it has got to be j carried on between us as the coalowners and between you as representing I the workers in the industry; and it is incumbent both in that way to come to such terms as will enable the industry to be carried on, and I hope you will agree as we do that it must be carried on upon its own footing.   What-over may be the views held on your side, and I do not know whether I can say perhaps that we hold the same views at all, I think it is perfectly clear that no industry in this country ought to be carried on by subsidies from the rest of the community.   The problem we have to face, therefore, is how to get this industry on to a basis upon which it can walk by itself.
584The Chairman : I can only say that I do not think we can accept the blame, for the fact that there are too many men in the industry at the present time. I think we have to recognise that for a given output the industry have now got to feed seven men where it had before to feed six men, and that is in consequence of the reduction in hours. However, if that is your definite reply on this matter, that you are not in any circumstances going to consider the return to the pre-1919 position with regard to hours, it would be folly on our part to take up time in pressing it and arguing it with you, because we take it that the position is one in regard to which you are not open to conviction.Mr. Varley : Hear, hear.The Chairman : You refuse to listen to argument and you stand where you did notwithstanding any facts or figures or arguments that might be put forward. So that as far as the return to the eight-hour day is concerned I think we must agree on our side that we cannot, in fact, do anything but accept, at any rate, the position which you put to us, that you are not pre-pared even to consider the question of the lengthening of the hours.Mr. Cook: Hear, hear.The Chairman : And that for the purposes of the rest of our discussions we have got to bar that, at any rate, out of all consideration.Mr. Cook : Hear, hear.The Chairman : Whether, when we come to that particular point in the list of the recommendations of the Commission where they deal with flexibility and elasticity in regard to hours, you are going to take up the same attitude I do not know. Whether you would prefer to discuss that phase of the question now, or whether you will leave it until we come to that particular point in the recommendations of the Commission, I do not know.Mr. Herbert Smith : In regard to the way that you are starting, I am not objecting to it, except that we ought to start with this Report and see what you have in your minds as to reorganisation. Isi not the position this, that we have got to get down now to what you have got to say on the wage Question&apos;? You say you have no objection because the Commission have somewhat changed your minds, or caused you to reconsider your position  you are prepared to discuss with us a National Agreement. Rut is not your position this, if you are not prepared to go into details of reorganisation, etc., could not you tell us what is in your minds as to how we stand in the. districts and what your ideas are about a National Agreement? There can be only one way for a National Agreement, one that is settled a,t the centre to govern the various districts.The Chairman : I assumed from what you said before that you wanted to know our reply on all the points raised in the recommendations of the Corn-mission,.Mr. Herbert Smith : Yes.The Chairman : And I think I indicated our unanimous desire to deal with them seriatim in that way, but as we were on this question of hours I did not know whether you preferred to continue on that topic and discuss that particular recommendation of the Commission which deals with more elasticity and flexibility in the distribution of such hours as are now possible and any such readjustments as would enable the practical necessities of the working of the collieries to be met without in the aggregate, for the ordinary men, any lengthening of the actual working hours. If you prefer to wait until we get to that in the course of our examination of the points that the Commission put to us we have no objection.   Which do you prefer?
This is by no means an easy problem. I think ihere is no doubt that it is the most difficult problem that this or any other industry in this country has ever had to face. And it is only by the two sides sitting down with a very sincere and earnest determination-1 will not say desire but determination-- to arrive at conclusions which can be put into practice and enable the industry to continue to produce coal and to maintain those who are engaged in it in, at any rate, a position in which a bare subsistence can be afforded to them.I do not think that any purpose would be served, Mr. Smith, by our going into figures or details as to what is the position of the industry at the present time. We have had all those fully explored before the Commission and the public in the returns that are made by the Mines Department periodically. Whether it is a matter for congratulation or not, it is the fact that we do expose more of the details of this industry to the public of this country, and also to the public abroad who are interested in the coal trade in this country and in their own coal trade, far more than is done in any other industry in this country or in any other country of the world. So that, assuming that the position is, therefore, clear enough in the minds of both of us, I think we might proceed to discuss the practical situation that we have got to face.Now we met last week at the invitation of the owners. We have, as you know, made no secret of the views that we hold as to the nature of the arrangements that should exist between the two sides in this industry. We put our views very strongly to the Commission, and we have made no secret of them in any way at all, as it was our firm conviction that it was for the good of the industry itself and for the good of the country that we should cease to have national negotiations, that there should no longer be a National agreement or a National Board, or anything at all of a national character in the arrangements subsisting between you and us, but that each district, or each area, should be a separate unit for the arrangement of its terms and conditions of employment without reference to any other district in the country. I say that we are still of the opinion that that would be in the best interests of the industry. But when we are face to face with a position such as now confronts us, we felt that we had to look all round this matter and reconsider our position. To some extent the Report of the Commission has had some bearing upon the decision to which we have come. In addition to that, we felt that at a time like this it would not be wise for either side in this industry to attach too much importance-or, perhaps, that is not expressing what I mean to take up a definite stand upon a question which the rest of the country might, perhaps, regard as one of form and not of substance; that we should not waste any of the valuable time which is left to us by entering into discussions with you upon a point upon which we know that you and we differed so strongly in opinion. I say quite frankly that we are making a sacrifice of our conviction, which is not a thing to boast about or to take any credit for, from that point of view. But we are not going to stand on the ground which we have taken up in the past in regard to this matter, and we are prepared, in order that we may get on with the real problem that faces us, to sit down with you and to cany on negotia-tions on a national basis, upon general principles, and upon such things as are of general application to the industry, and to enter into a National Agreement with you on the same lines.So that we have in that way taken a very great step forward and removed, as I have said, something which might have been an obstacle to our getting down to discuss the question of how the industry is to be made a self-supporting, economic industry in the country. . Having taken
582that step, I think you will agree that the ground is cleared for us now to o-et down to a discussion of the form and substance of that national agree-rnent. We are, in effect, adopting in that respect the recommendation of the Commission that we should meet you on a national basis to discuss questions of national principle and such details as are of national applica-tioii.It seems to us that the next useful step we could take would be to proceed to investigate the national position with a view to clearing the around so as to enable us to build up such a national agreement as we may-bo able to arrive at.I do not know, Mr. Smith, whether at this stage you would like to interpose and let us have your views on that point before we proceed any further.Mr. Herbert Smith : Of course, the point in my mind was that probably you would try to elucidate what your intentions are. We have to get back to this Report of the Commission. That Report distinctly says that on any sacrifice that has got to be made it is understood there will be a reorganisation of the industry. You tell us very carefully that you have come away from the position that you set out for namely, opposition to a National Agreement. You tell us now that you are prepared to discuss questions that are applicable to districts and details of a national aspect. We ought to see, first, whether you people are willing to accept this report, and to explain to us how you intend to reorganise this industry. Because some of us have been arguing for years against the policy you have had in this industry, but it has been like crying in the wilderness; no one has listened to us at all, while we have got into the position we are in to-day.I think that we are as anxious as anyone on your side to avoid any conflict if it is at all possible. But you people have got to appreciate this,, that the worker in the industry has been miaking sacrifices for some con-siderable time, and before he is asked to make any further sacrifice he ought to get ho know what is likely to be put before&apos; us to expect that sacrifice. If we are going on exactly as we have gone on before it means that this Commission &apos;s Report must foster private -enterprise at the expense of the workers in the industry, unless out of the Report there is going to be an agreed policy of reorganisation of the whole industry from top to bottom.. Everyone is agreed that there are too many hangers-on in the industry who jet a living for looking around.   That is one of the thingsi to be reorganised.The next thing is to have a general review of the position; and, as my friends told you last week in my absence-^and I am. very glad that they did  rou sat very quiet when we were before the Prime Minister, even when we were trying to focus the position to find out what was going to happen after the 30th April. I along with my colleagues think that it was wrong for fou to have taken up that position; because you know very well that by the present system of organisation and outlook which we have there has got to )e something to stave off the position as wa see it, if the worker who works n the industry is going to live. You did not feel disposed to do it. To-day &apos;ou tell us you have come away from a, certain position you took up and tie prepared to go into details with us. Ought nob the details to be, first, is to what you intend doing with the Commission &apos;s Report as far as your ide is concerned on reorganisation, as to pit committees, and as. to several tiier tilings that could be named?   I think that is where we ought to start.You may tell me that this is the last day of March, and that it is ot far to the last day of April. I quite appreciate that. But, unfortunately, e have been prevented for some considerable time from asking and trying
to get what we contend our workers are due to have in the industry. We have tried to carry on as best we could in that direction. You say, in reply, that you have tried to carry on. But this Commission has revealed certain things. It has told us that as far as nationalisation is concerned it is opposed to nationalisation of the industry. Well, then, it ought to be for you people who are in the industry to tell us how you will reorganise this industry; how yor;will meet the position; how you will meet the question of a respectable wage for a respectable day&apos;s work. Those are the main things that appeal to us at the present time. My Committee is just as anxious as you are, when we have cleared general principles out of the way, to get to details; but we ought to deal with general principles first, and I suggest to you that you ought to tell us what you have made up your minds about in regard to the reorganisation of the industry.The Chairman : I do not want you to think that there is any question of fencing for position or anything else in this matter. We take far too serious a view of the position to contemplate, I hope from either side, any-fencing for position or any delay in getting down to the real, stern facts we have to face.We shall be quite prepared in fact, in a general way we are prepared now to indicate toi you what our view is, as I have no doubt you are pre-pared to indicate to us what your view is, upon the recommendations which have been put forward by the Commission for our consideration, and which the Government have intimated to us are to be agreed between us as a con-dition of their carrying out certain things which they have detailed and whict the Commission recommended them to do. But, as I think we agreed on both sides at the last meeting, neither the things that the Government are prepared to do or can do, nor the things that are laid clown, so far as the Report is concerned, for what you call it the reorganisation of the industry, can have any effect upon the working of the industry as from the 1st of May. Whatever may be the decisions on these other points, I think you will agree I believe you must agree that if we were to agree that they would bear fruit, there would be none of that fruit available to help the industry, if it is going to help the industry at all, for a considerable period of time.We do not want on our side, therefore, to have this standing in the way of our coming down to grips with the read situation. We have no reason to object, I think, to our taking up this question as you have put it to us, and going through in detail the points which the Commission have indicated as those which, in their opinion, are practicable for for the sake of a better term I will accept what you call it the reorganisation of the industry. We must say quite frankly, as, I think, probably you may say in. regard to some of the other points, that on many of these points we think the Commission have not been consistent with then own arguments in the conclusions that they put forward.We ourselves hold a very strong view that on the question of the hours of work the conclusion at which they have arrived is entirely false to the grounds upon which they have dealt with the question of hours. I think it is only right that we should indicate to you still that our view remains exactly what it was upon the question of the hours of work; and we look upon that as the greatest measure of reorganisation that is possible for the industry and the only measure of reorganisation which will bear fruit immediately. There is no question at all, I think, that in the minds of the Commission they regarded the question of hours as one which would substantially reduce the costs of production in the industry, and their views clearly throughout their Report are that the costs of production must be
583reduced if the industry is to survive at all. I do not want to criticise any further their findings upon this matter; but I think it would be wrong not to continue to urge upon you that this is the greatest measure the greatest practicable and immediately practicable measure of reform within this industry, and the one which will bring the best results to those who will be engaged in it, and really essential to an economic solution.We have to say quite frankly that we do not see any hope in the immediate future, or, indeed, in the long run, for real prosperity in this industry as long as the hours of work are curtailed and the output per man in the industry kept down below what it could be, and below the output in countries which are our strongest competitors for our export trade. I think Mr. Eichards said at our last meeting that your view was that for those who are engaged in the industry there must be a living wage no matter how few they may be.Mr. Cook : Hear, hear.The Chairman : I take it that any measure which increase the wages of those who are engaged must, if that is your view or ought, at any rate, if that is your view meet with your approval; and there is no step which will increase the wages of those who may be engaged in the industry so promptly and so permanently as a return to the longer working day.We recognise at once that unless you and we agree upon this question of hours no step can be taken in regard to it. Even if Parliament were to remove the compulsion which now exists against your working more than seven hours it would not follow that, without an agreement on your part, there would be any longer time worked in the industry. It would be a case of taking a horse to the water but being unable to compel him to drink unless he wanted to do so. Now, we do strongly urge I am not going to take up any more time over this matter upon your consideration this question which to us is absolutely vital.I -want to say this at; once. We are not going to make this, unless you agree with us, a crucial question at the present time. The Commission has reported against the extension of the hours which are worked. The. Govern-ment has said that it accepts the recommendations of the Commission, provided we come to an agreement among ourselves upon those, things which are indicated as being our part of the Report. Among those, as I have said, is the question of hours; and it would be only as a result of an agree-ment between us and you that the Government could or would, if their declaration is to stand, introduce any legislation.We ask you again to consider in the most serious possible way whether, in face of the facts that now confront us in this industry and the imperative necessity of bringing down the cost of production to a point which will enable the industry to continue and to give employment to a large number of men, it is not in your real interests to come to terms with us upon the matter. But, as I have said, we are not going to stand in the way of negotiations between you and us to arrive at such agreement as may be necessary.Mr. Varley : Or a bargaining factor?The Chairman : We are not going to make it even a bargaining factor, except that it is our duty to say to you that it Ls perfectly clear thai the wages which the industry can pay on a seven hours basis are bound to be less than the wages it can pay on an eight hours basis:. To that extent, and to that extent only, are we going to refer to the matter in any sense which might be called a bargaining sense.
Having said that, I do not think there is anything to prevent us deal in&quot; with the points that the Commission has put for our consideration on both sides seriatim; and I hope that you will be able to express, either in the course of or as a result of such discussion as may take place between us this morning, your views upomthese particular questions.Mr. Herbert Smith : I think we are bound to follow up that statement because I realise this is the last day of March, 1926, and I may be tohi about it in years to come. I want to say that for myself and my Committee and for the members of the Federation we have had long hours of work and we know what they gave us. We have had an eight-hour day and we know what that gave us. We have had a seven-hour day; and if tilings had been put into operation that ought to have been we should have been talking about six hours new instead of talking about eight hours. It is because there has not been that willingness on your part toi co-operate to make that position that we are where we are to-day. To talk about hours is one of the worst mistakes you can make. We have no intention, we have no desire, and we shall be driven by sheer force to accept any longer hours than we have to-day. I want to make that perfectly clear. For years we have been agitating for shorter hours as the pits are getting deeper and as men are getting knocked out earlier than they used to be owing to the atmospheric conditions; and there is a general concensus of opinion in five countries that for ordinary work they ought to get down to an eight-hour day; we are asking our people to work at depths varying from 20 yards to over 900 yards before they start to think about working eight hours. I want to tell you as owners that my Committee and the Miners&apos; Federation will give no countenance to longer hours and -we are backed up in that by the Commission. The Commission has given its decision. Some of you people have been talking about, or some owners have been talking about, working five days a week, but not to exceed a certain number of hours per week; and some have gone soi far as to say, &quot; We will pay six days&apos; wages for five.&quot;   I think you will pay anything really.The Chairman : You must not assume there is any authority behind any of those statements.Mr. Herbert Smith : I said &quot; some.&quot; I did not say on behalf of the Coalowners&apos; Association. I might touch one or two who are here if I wanted to, but I do not want to be at all personal. I am taking you as the authority. I am not applying it to your Association and saying that they have propagated that idea.So that I think we ought to say at once from both sides that the Commission has found without any question, and advisedly, there is to be no alteration in the hours. From my own personal observations I am satisfied there is no need for it. All I say is that it wants reorganising, and the results will prove what the industry can do. But we have got too many men in the industry. We have asked the industry to feed really more men than it can feed. When the trade came along you took them in whether they had any practical experience of mining or not. We have tried for years to make it a. skilled trade, and it would be a skilled trade if people did not go in after they had reached a certain age. But you have gone on and gone on, and the consequence is that we have got where we are. You say, again, after the Commission has come to its. findings : &quot; We still tell you there can be no economic effect to be satisfactory until you go back to longer hours.&quot; Then I have to say to you that we shall not go back to longer hours, and there will be no.economic effect. We had better clear that up right away.
Mr. Herbert Smith : I think we had better go on as you say, with regard to the recommendations.The Chairman :  I take it that we are prepared on both sides to   i indicate our attitude towards these recommendations in so far as they call for action, upon the one side or the other?Mr. Herbert Smith : I think we had better be clear on that.   I do not   1 wish, nor do we wish, to mislead you people.   We are rather anxious to   i get to know what is in your minds, because one we have dealt with, but   i there are two more fundamental principles namely, National Agreement  i and the question of suggested alterations in minimum.   It is fair for me to say that at the.present time we have taken up this attitude, that our  i districts have to consider this and to come back to another conference.   i In the meantime, if opportunity arose, we should meet the owners and oet i to know from them what their position was.   Because we happen to beBin  i this position, that we have not been asking or seeking for any improvements, a although improvement of wages is long overdue.   We have been attacked i rather than attacking; and those who attack us ought to tell us what they j expect from us.   Because we may have to sit down and make some counter i proposals to you people there is plenty of room to do it and the con-sequence is that we are not in, a position.   So it is no good me misleading you by saying yes or no to any particular thing except on hours, and on that we have our mandate and we know where we are.&apos;. The Chairman : I do not know that it is worth troubling about, but . we do not admit we are in the position of attackers or that you are in the position of attacked.   The Commission was brought about by you and not by us-you and the Government.Several Representatives of the Men : No.The Chairman : We were not parties to its appointment; and I do not 1 think it can be denied that at our meeting with the Cabinet we protested i against the disembowelling of the industry in public for a second time.Mr. Herbert Smith : Are we now manoeuvring for position ?The Chairman : No.   I am just making a casual remark.Mr. Herbert Smith: I want to say the attack did happen.   Our people got a notice from you people.Mr. Cook : Hear, hear.The Chairman : That is ancient history.Mr. Herbert Smith: It is true.The Chairman: In the meantime you had said, &quot; If we can get before this Commission we will show how the industry can be worked after the end of April without any reduction in wages or extension of hours.&quot;Mr. Cook : That is not correct.Mr. Herbert Smith : You had better not attribute that to us on the notes, because I am not going to father that.The Chairman : I think it is quite possible to find a record somewhere.Mr. Herbert Smith : I think what I said, and I say it still, was that the Government refused in 1919 to accept a Beport backed up by the owners to nurse this industry. When you cannot nurse the kid any longer now you say to us, &quot; You try and keep it quiet and we will watch you do it.&quot; All we want is the opportunity to doi it. We could have got that through nationalisation-
585The Chairman : The kid has been kicking so much since that it is rather difficult to bring it up.Mr. Cook : The statement you made cannot be found anywhere.The Chairman : I am willing to have that remark taken off the notes f you wish. *Mr. Cook : It was the Government who set up the Commission.The Chairman : But the fact does remain that you did lead us to think fyou were going to produce some scheme which would enable the industry o carry on without any reduction in wages or increase in hours. But that las not materialised, so we had better now-Mr. Cook : Is it not better to make it clear that there would have been lia Commission if you had not given us notice; so Mr. Smith is correct in saying you attacked us.The Chairman : Probably there would not have been any industry by .iiis time if we had not taken that step. Well, Mr. Smith, I think we had better go on in the way that you have been suggesting. I should not like to -ay that we are surprised, but we are a little disappointed that you are not in the same position as we are namely, to indicate your views upon these points as they arise; but we do not want on that account to have any delay in dealing with the matter, and we have no objection at all to discussing -each of these with you, and, so far as we can, indicating our attitude towards them. If you like, we will take them seriatim and have such discussion -upon them as may be desirable.Mr. Herbert Smith : Yes.The Chairman : Will you turn now to page 229 of the Beport. You get there the suggestions which I take it we have to give our attention to. We are not limiting the discussion in any way at all; I do not think that on either side we should attempt to bar out from discussion any point that either side thinks ought to be discussed.Mr. Cook: Why do you start there instead of starting at page 232? You are taking one subject out of its setting there.The Chairman : Because 229 comes before 232.Mr. Cook : While it may come before it, there is no sequence, because it is only one subject you are starting on at 229.The Chairman : I have not the slightest objection to starting wherever you like.   If you would like us to start on page 232 I am quite willing.Mr. Cook : I do not mind.The Chairman : Which do you prefer?Mr. Herbert Smith : I am in your hands entirely. You are laying ihe case before us, and I am following.The Chairman: I hope you will follow. (Laughter.) I think No. 1 on page 229 is something which leaves itself for discussion when we have gone through all the other points.Mr. Herbert Smith: Yes; but it is an important paragraph: &quot; Before flny sacrifices are asked from those engaged in the industry, it shall be definitely agreed between them that all practicable means for improving its organisation and increasing its efficiency should be adopted, as speedily as the circumstances in each ease allow.&quot;The Chairman : Yes. That applies as much to you as it does to us. So that until you are in a position to let us know your views upon thesec
points that follow I do not think we can either of us come down to a ssriousl consideration of No. 1. &quot;We have got to get the views of both sides onf these questions before No. 1 can usefully be dealt with.Mr. Frank Varley : Except of course that when we have made up our] minds someone will have to lead, off and tell us what he thinks about it.The Chairman : I do not think we shall have any objection to leading off, if you want us to.Mr. Cook : You will have to apply those facts.The Chairman : There are things which apply to each side, and. we should go through these and see exactly where we stand on all of them.Now No. 2 says: &quot; The owners should discontinue charging the miners as a body with deliberate attempts to destroy the prosperity of the industry in order to compel its nationalisation. It is possible that there may be a small number of individuals here and there who are animated by this idea, but we are convinced that the point is without substance.&quot; As far as we are concerned we will accept that recommendation. We will say no more about it until, may I say, there is some cause to say more about it; but we do not want the atmosphere to be clouded or tainted in any- sort of way by any recriminations of any kind when we are settling down to such a serious task as that which confronts us now. We think it would be in the highest degree unwise and seriously detrimental to our interests if there were any recriminations of any kind in public as between the two sides. We have got quite enough to do in trying to square out this matter between ourselves, when we meet together, without making accusations against each other iiii the Press or anything of that sort.Mr. Frank Varley : So that on that point the owners accept the implied chastisement ?The Chairman : No, we do not accept anything except the rccommenchi-tion not to do what they say we have been doing.Mr. Baker : Then you must discontinue doing something that has been done?The Chairman : We discontinue to do what they say we have been; doing. Then, I think, without reading No. 3 at the top of page 230 we will apply the same remarks to it as we have done to No. 2.No. 4 calls for a reply from you.Mr. Herbert Smith : &quot; The miners on their part should cease to attach exaggerated weight to losses of output due to failures of the management to provide the colliers with proper supplies of tubs, rails, timber, or other requisites.&quot; We are prepared to accept that unless occasion should arise when we have to tell you the truth again, and then we shall tell it. (Laughter.)The Chairman: I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Smith, because that makes it so much easier for me to say that we will accept in the very same terms, again, Nos. 2 and 3.Mr. Herbert Smith : I think I had better tell you why. It was a suggestion made by the Commission that they ask for each party to seieet 50 pits. We agreed. We were informed that the owners agreed, then we were informed afterwards, that the owners refused. If my Committee had been led by me we should have refused to do anything until you did; because it said now that the Beport cannot be reliable because the pits were chosen by the miners. I can prove the conditions every day of my life ; I do not go down a pit with my eyes shut; I am told fit the top that
58B men do not know what it is to wait for tubs, that it is all a tale; when B*o down I find what the true position is. That is why I say we will Kept that. I will say no more about the past until we have a genuine Be, and then I will tell you about it when it arises.I The Chairman : I do not know whether I am prepared to follow you to Bit extent, because even when we have a genuine case on something that Bsuggested in Nos. 2 and 3, I do not think wa shall make a shout about it Bile things are in the critical state that they are, while these negotiations B going on.I Mr. Herbert Smith : I do not think we will. I have no intention to I so while the negotiations are going on.1 The Chairman : Then I think we are agreed on that.   Now, No. 5. j Mr. Herbert Smith : That we are doing, are not we ?I The Chairman: We will take again: &quot;The mineowners should not Bfuse to engage, in discussions on a national footing with the Miners&apos; Bderation of Great Britain. All the principal industries of the country Induct negotiations between employers&apos; and employed on a national basis &apos;&apos; which I do not think is the actual truth, but we need not bother about it  land we can see no reason why the mining industry should be an iception.&quot; I think what I have said earlier covers the whole point that lises on that sentence.   &quot; At the same time, the conditions imperativelyquire that there should be a large degree of flexibility in the wage rates the different districts.   The Miners&apos; Federation should recognise this,Ithout detriment to the broad policy that the general principles should beid down nationally.   Now we accept the last two sentences in just theme way as we accept the first.Mr. Herbert Smith : Is not there flexibility in the various district basis tes now?  These people cannot have known the real results of the districts, else there would have been no need to put this in at all.   I go to one strict where there is 7s. a day and I go to another district where it is :. or 5s. 6d.   Is not that flexibility enough?The Chairman : All I need say on that point is, that I think we fully ;ree that it is imperatively necessary that there should be a large degree : flexibility in the wage rates in the different districts.No. 6 goes very closely with No. 5; so perhaps I might read that through store we get into any further discussion upon the point: &quot; As the first step jeordingly to the making of a new wage agreement the Mining Association ad the Miners&apos; Federation should meet nationally. The procedure to be illowed thereafter will depend upon the decision then taken; it appears to s a reasonable course for the National Conference to refer the question of linimum percentage and such other matters as they think appropriate to istrict associations to frame proposals. Those proposals would be sub-litted to the National Conference for approval.&quot; Our view on that point as been expressed in part in my opening remarks. We have met you, and &apos;e are meeting for the purpose of trying to draw up a National Agreement idiich will embody such national principles as are necessary to guide the industry as a whole and in detail; and to lay down the procedure which has o be provided to carry out those principles into practice. But we hold trongly and absolutely that the questions of the minimum percentages md some other matters can only be dealt with, and must be dealt with, n the districts themselves.
Mr. Herbert Smith : Is your interpretation of that this, that we shall say to each district, &quot; Go and sit down and see what minimum wa^e you can agree to, and then send it to the National Board for its hall-mark if both parties agree to accept it &quot;?.  Is that your idea?The Chairman : Our idea is that it is only the districts themselves that, are competent to deal with the question of the minimum percentages that can be paid in the districts, and therefore at the earliest possible moment the districts ought to set themselves to the consideration of this question and work out for themselves independently, governed only by such national principles as are laid down, the minimum wage rate for that particular district.Mr. Baker: When you say &quot; districts,&quot; what districts have your mind ?  What are the districts ?The Chairman: I do not know that it would be useful at the present moment to deal with that question. We have had certain areas in operation in the past for the purpose of wage determination. It is for those people-in those areas to determine for themselves from our point of view how they wdl distribute those for the future.Mr. Herbert Smith : That is a later question.The Chairman : Yes, I do not think we need take up any time on that.you in mr. Herbert Smith: I would like to know what is really in your mind. You had better tell us straight.The Chairman : I was proceeding, without any equivocation, to tell you that our view is definitely that the question of the minimum rates must, be dealt with in the districts themselves between the parties &quot;who represent the owners and the men in the particular district. The National Board is not competent to deal with the varying minimum rates which it may be-necessary to fix in the particular districts throughout the country.Mr. Frank Varley : That must mean then that the size of the minimum in a district is not one of those cases which you call a national principle.The Chairman : Exactly. The quantum of the minimum in a particular&apos; district in our opinion is a district question entirely and absolutely,, and is-not one which the National Board could deal with for the purposes of determining. We should be prepared to accept the view Mr. Smith has-expressed in regard to the function of the National Board in regard to it,, that when the districts have arrived at their own settlements on the minimum rates the National Board puts its stamp, its hall-mark, upon it,, and that is all that it is competent and required to do.Mr. Herbert Smith : You had better clear up that last statement. It. is not a, question of Mr. Smith&apos;s view.   Mr. Smith asked if it. meant that.The Chairman : That, in our view, is what it does mean.Mr. Herbert Smith : So I take it that your point is that we should separate at some time, and each district should go back and see what it can fix up as a minimum percentage on. its base rates now operating. Is that it?The Chairman: Yes; and in our view it is imperative that that should be done as soon as ever possible.Mr. Frank Varley: But even accepting the Commission,&apos;s report, to which we are by no means committed at this moment, is not that going a long way round&apos;? Do not they rather say that the National Board should define even the quantum so asi not to intensify competition and so as noo to allow a low minimum in one district unduly to interfere with another ?
587The Chairman : I do not think they say that.Mr. Herbert Smith : Yes, I think so.  We will see if we can find it.The Chairman : I think if you take the Report by and large it is quite clear that the view of the Commission has been that general principles&apos; are all that the National Board can decide in regard to the settlement of wages; that the wage rates themselves, both in respect of their basis and of the minimum percentage payable upon those bases in the districts, must be questions which the districts only can deal with. It is obviously impossible for a body like this to consider the circumstances in the districts.Mr. Cook: Here are the words: &quot; We do not see how such a wage, in a community so small and so closely united as Great Britain, can ultimately be fixed by other than national authorities. To give a free hand to each district to settle its own standard of living without consultation and without regard to any other is to expose the standards of the more efficient and prosperous areas.&quot; Your statement is, and your interpretation is, that each district, apart and independent, on its own, should fix it. Here definitely and clearly the Commission opposes that view.Lord Gainford : That is a quotation from Mr. Tawney. If you go on with the same paragraph you will get the whole sense of their recommenda-tion: &quot; We conclude accordingly.&quot;Mr. Cook : Yes.   Read the whole thing through then.Mr. Lee: Yes, we ought to have it on the notes.The Chairman: &quot; We conclude accordingly  &quot;Mr. Cook : Let us read it all through.The Chairman: Then will you read it?Mr. Cook : Yes: &quot; To give a free hand to each district to settle its own standard of living without consultation and without regard to any other is to expose the standards of the more efficient and prosperous areas on which the future of the country rests, to undermining by the weaker areas it opens the door to cut-throat competition between different districts at the expense of wages.&apos; We conclude accordingly that the minimum percentage for each district should be settled or at least approved by agreement between bodies representing all the employers and all the workpeople in the industry.&quot;   That is national.Lord Gainford : Go on.Mr. Cook : Let us repeat it.The Chairman : Will you read it, Mr. Cook.Mr. Cook: &quot;This does not mean that the minimum percentage for each district may not with advantage be discussed in the first instance by district associations, if they think fit, provided that the minima thus pro-visionally agreed are afterwards submitted for approval by some national authority.&quot; Surely that does not at all bear the interpretation you have placed upon it.The Chairman : I think the only interpretation for practical purposes that we can place upon it is the one I have indicated to you, that the question of the minimum percentages to be paid in each district must be determined by the districts themselves. What form, or what nature, the approval of the,National Board who do it afterwards may take to our mind is not a question of very great importance, because I think you wiU agree with us that when in. a particular district the two sides have agreed upon a minimum, percentage to be applicable for that district, it.is.inconceivable
I hat the National Board would proceed to investigate, for the purpose of varying, or vetoing, that decision. All that it could do, 1 think, would be to see that there was no infringement of national principles in the decision at which the districts had arrived.Mr. Herbert Smith: Do we take it from you-?The Chairman : Another point is dealt with in that paragraph it savs &quot; other things&apos;.&quot; Take the question of subsistence1 wage or such variation of it as may be determined upon; we have always recognised that the subsistence wage has been and should be a, matter for each district to settle itstelf quite independently, without reference at all to any national body in regard to it.Now I think you would further agree that for many districts and lor a large number of men employed in those districts, the subsistence wage lias been a&apos; matter of even greater imporance than the minimum in the past, and there is&apos; no new principle of any kind involved in the view we take that the vage rate of a particular district, both in regard to the minima and in regard to the subsistence wage, or any other modification of subsistence wage, should be dealt with in the districts and can only be dealt with properly in the districts themselves, and that there is no useful function that a National Board can perform in relation to matters of that kind.I remember not so very many years ago being admonished for venturing to express an opinion on some matter from Yorkshire. I had to confess I did not know anything about Yorkshire, and to promise in future not to try and intervene in any Yorkshire matter. I think that must apply to e very-one of us in regard to every district other than our own, and we see no ground of any sort or kind for having a question of this kind which affects a district, and that district only, dealt with other than in the district and by the district., - Mr. Frank Varley : They do not agree it affects a district only. The particular paragraph is two-thirds of the way down on page 149: &quot; Because the Forest of Dean cannot guarantee a standard of living absolutely up to the minimum thought necessary in Yorkshire, it does not follow that mining in the Forest of Dean should cease to exist. It is, however, essential, as we point out below, to secure, either by national negotiation or national approval of district negotiations, that the various district minima do not diverge too widely, and that there is no possibility of that cut-throat coin-petition at the expense of wages which the Miners&apos; Federation fear &quot;; which implies directly that the divergence of the minima should be the concern of the National Board, either primarily or secondarily, after partially agreed on in the district.The Chairman : I do not know that either of us would like to be tied to acceptance of every expression of opinion that the Commission have given in the whole of their Report.Mr. Herbert Smith : Is not that one of the points we tried to make to start with, that you should tell us what you really did intend with this Eeport ?The Chairman : I do not think there ought to be any doubt in your mind, Mr. Smith, after what I have said, that what is in our minds quite definitely is that the questions of the minimum rate and of the subsistence or such variation of subsistence wages as may be agreed upon, are questions to-be dealt with in the districts themselves; and when they have been dealt with in the districts themselves, then they may be brought up to the National Board for such approval, or stamping with a hall-mark (as you put it) as we may agree may be necessary.
39588Mr. Cook: Can the Board interfere with them? ;The Chairman : I should say not.Mr. Cook : That is what we want to know.   What is the use ?The Chairman : Is there any district which would consent to any other body than itself, whether national or otherwise, interfering with a decision on a question of this kind that it had arrived at vital to the district itself and affecting that district only?Mr. Cook : Then you disagree with the findings of the Commission here? Let that be clear.The Chairman : We disagree with the expression of opinion on page 149. Mr. Cook : .152.The Chairman : But we defer to the view of the Commission that the National Conference should refer straight away the questions of the minimum rates to be paid to the districts for their consideration.Mr. Thomas Biciiards: We do not accept that that is the view of the Commission at all. Our reading of the Commission&apos;s dealing with that matter is that the minimum is the business of the National Board. They cite the forest of Dean in the paragraph read by Mr. Varley, but necessarily the National Board might take-to itself powers to vary the minimums in the districts if they chose. But surely the whole scheme is one of national negotiation and fixing on a, national minimum, with the suggestion that the National Board may, if they so choose, refer to some districts for con-sideration a variable minimum and then that the National Board must approve it. They use the imperative term that it must be approved by the National Board. That is entirely different from your scheme when you say that this Board must at once refer to the districts the whole question of considering the minimum they are to set up with the full power to do it. You would get a. separate and different minimum in every district in the country. What meaning is there in the reservation that the Commission has put in the hands of the National Boad to prevent &quot; cut-throat com-petition &quot;-to use their own term? It may be your scheme, that is another tiling, but do nob pretend it is the scheme tho Commission are asking you to accept.The Chairman : I think it will be time to deal with that question as to whether it is the scheme the Commission on the whole are asking us&apos; to accept or not when you express your opinion upon the procedure that should be adopted. We do not think there is anything in the Beport of the Com-mdssdon which is contrary to our view that the question of minima, should be referred straight away to the districts&apos; for their consideration and for their determination. The other question of what may bo the approval which it is--contemplated the National Board or a National Conference may be per-initted to apply to such district determination will be a matter that can arise-lor discussion again. But -we feel very strongly that to -delay these ques-tlons of minima percentages and subsistence wages and every other matter-which will have to be dealt with in the districts&apos; themselves will be to wastes valuable time and to prevent us arriving at some definite conclusions within the time allotted to us. It is very clearly and very strongly our view, that the district percentages must be matters for the districts themselves. I do not want to leave any doubt in your minds that that is the view which we-take.Mr. Herbert Smith : It is an unfortunate view. If I understand yon-aright the first thing is that the districts have to fix a minimum ; the next thing it has&apos; to do is to fix the subsistence wage; the next thing it has to do-
are any other details, and, if you choose, you can submit them to the National Board to look at, but they have no prerogative at all. If that is your finding we are not far off the end, because that means smashing the whole thing up without any reservation whatever. Why is tlie word &quot;national &quot; us&apos;ed here at all if-there is not to be any national sequence in this business&apos;? We shall simply get where we have been complaining about other countries cut throat competition this and that district under-eutting each other at the expense of the workers&apos;&apos; wages. We are not going there, and we had better be clear on that. We are prepared to discuss a wage agreement with you people; we are prepared to go on as we have&apos; gone on, or as we are at the present time, if you people are willing. If you want to discuss wages&apos; we say it must have a, national aspect; when it is fixed it must be fixed nationally, and we will see how far we can agree-with it.The Chairman : I think it is unfortunate if we have arrived at a point where we disagree so fundamentally; but I think for the moment it wall be sufficient to note each other&apos;s view on this point and proceed.Mr. Frank Varley : All I interposed for was that you were not necessarily identifying what you were saying with the views of the Corn-mission. Totu say that there is nothing to prevent all the Commission^ findings, the reference of this question immediately to the districts for discussion, and you added very carefully &quot; determination.&quot; There we disagree on the matter of interpretation; we do not find that in the Corn-mission&apos;s Beport at all.Mr. Cook: There is a further point. Mr. Varley has explained that; but if you accept the statement of our President that that is your desire, as he put it, and enumerated in the points he put forward you are speaking on behalf of the Association, and that is your point of view at the moment.The Chairman : Clearly there is no question about that. There is no dubiety of any kind with regard to it.   That is our definite view.Mr. Cook : That includes all district customs, agreements, perquisites, and anything there may be in any district?The Chairman : Yes.Mr. Cook: Everything.The Chairman: Yes. Then shall we get on to the next point that arises. I do not know that there is anything in the paragraphs which follow on pages 230&apos; and 23.1; they are more in the nature of comments than of recommendations. There is nothing in them which seems to me to call for any discussion between us on the lines of the discussion that we are now carrying on. The question which is referred to here of the Government taking practicable measures for the assistance of any labour that may be displaced, or for facilitating its transfer and providing funds the last sentence on page 231 the Prime Minister did refer to this point in some form or other; it is No. 11 in the list of the Prime Ministers points.Mr. Lee: &quot;The Government to facilitate the transfer of displaced labour and to provide funds for the purpose.&quot;The Chairman : I do not know that that calls for any comment between us. It is a matter for the Government primarily. It may be at a later stage a matter for us if we can put our heads together to see what it is possible to do to facilitate things. For the time being we on both sides keep an open mind on this particular question.Now we would go on to page 233, unless you think there is anything on page 232 which calls for attention.
589Mr. Herbert Smith: On page 232 you.-get&apos;: &quot; Mining,, in many places, should be intimately associated with several other industries^ with gas, alectricity, smokeless fuel, oil, chemical products, blast furnaces, and coke Dvens. A beginning has been made towards this combination, but it is no more than a beginning.&quot; What have you to say in regard to coke ovens md by-products becoming part of the industry? 1 The Chairman : On that point there is no hesitation at all in saying fchat we stand exactly where we did, that the coke ovens and by-product plants or any gas, electricity, smokeless fuel, oil, chemical products, or blast furnaces, or any of those things that are referred, to should not form part of the industry for any purpose at all connected with our relations with you. I think on that we have the backing of the Commission. So that in that respect our view is, and it is the only view that we can take, that we go on exactly as we have been doing in the past in regard to the delimitation of what belongs to this industry and what does not belong to it.Mr. Cook : It is very important with regard to the remarks on page 232 that you should let us know what you think of them. It is here: &quot; At the same time we cannot agree with the view presented to us by the mine-owners that little can be done to improve the organisation of the industry., and that the only practicable course is to lengthen hours and to lower wages. In our view large changes are necessary in other directions, and large progress is possible. We agree that immediate measures are indis-pensable to deal with the immediate position, but the effort, ought not to stop there.&quot; They point out, as you see, it is twofold. Then they come to the need for changes. What is your opinion on this, that &quot; The industry is marked by great diversities. Among the existing collieries many date from an earlier time, and according to modern standards are badly planned?&quot; Then we have the methods of utilising coal. I should like you to let us know your views on that, because they say definitely the methods of utilising coal are unscientific.The Chairman : I think you will find that all those points are enumerated again in the recommendations on re-organisation, which come on the following page, and I thought we could deal with them in the order in which they are placed on page 233, unless there is any particular point or any particular subject on page 232 which you think is not included in the following pages.Mr. Cook : All right.Mr. Gill : I would like to ask you one question. Does not that paragraph on page 232, which Mr. Cook has just read for example, one or two words1 of it &quot; and that the only practicable course is to lengthen hours and to lower wages &quot; does not that rather upset the contention you put up in your opening remarks this morning when you Said neither in the immediate future nor in the long run could anything be done in the industry without lengthening the hours?   Is not this rather a contradiction?The Chairman : I&apos; do not think your quotation of my remarks is absolutely correct.Mr. Gill : I have a note that I made.The Chairman: What I think I said was that none of these things could effect any improvement in the industry in the immediate future.Mr. Gill : Or in the long run without lengthening hours.The Chairman : Nor for some time to come, even granted they did produce improvements at all.Mr. Gill : Without altering the hours.
The Chairman : I do not know that having disposed of that for the time being it would be wise for us&apos; to come back to it.Mr. Cook : That is definitely disposed of as. far as our side is concerned.The Chairman : We do not propose during these&apos; conferences&apos; to come back to the point of lengthening the hours unless some of your people want us to go back to it again.Mr. Cook: That will not be on our side.Mr. Gill : We do not agree with you that the lengthening of the hours is the only remedy.The Chairman : If we can pursue it we shall be only too glad to do so.Mi&apos;. Cook : We know that; but our President has expressed our views.Mr. W. P. Richardson : It has been the waste which goes on in the industry.   I understand you want to get away from this&apos; pretty quickly.The Chairman : If we dwelt on that we&apos; might be transgressing the wise resolutions we came to for the time being on Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4.Mr. Cook : But surely that is not an excuse for evading a question which must be dealt with.The Chairman: That was not Mr. Richardson&apos;s question.Mr. Cook : Oh yes.The Chairman : Shall we go on to page 233 the proposal for nationalisation.   We accept the Commission^ findings.   (Laughter.)Mr. Cook : Surely !The Chairman : Do you ?Mr. Herbert Smith : When you ask, do we, we have to accept it for the time being if it is part of the peace; but I am surprised you hanging on like you do when it is not a success, when you can have it taken out of your hands. It makes us dubious and causes us to think there is something-more in it than has come to light.The Chairman: Do not lead us on to that; you are tempting us. I think we can agree on the first part of 233 with regard to the nationalisation Of the mines.Mr. Herbert Smith: When you say that, there is the Commission&apos;s finding. I am not satisfied that they have come to the best decision; the best decision, I think, would have been nationalisation, and the Miners&apos; Federation and the Committee think that.Mr. Cook : That is still our position.The Chairman : I can assure you that it is not in our own interests ii we could get someone to buy us out that we are hanging on; it is because we have more regard for the others engaged in the industry and for the country as a wdiole.Mr. Herbert Smith : Are you asking us to reply to that, because I will reply to it.The Chairman : No, I am not asking you to do that. Now wdth regard to the recommendations on reorganisation. No. 1 ownership of the mineral is the first under this heading. We have not changed our opinion on this point.Mr. Frank Varley : Which opinion 1919 or 1925 ?The Chairman : I am speaking for the Mining Association of Great Britain, which has never changed its opinion.
590Mr. Frank Vaeley : I beg your pardon.Mr. Herbert Smith : Are you telling us seriously you spoke in 1919 I without authority from the Mining Association?The Chairman : Absolutely. We were in an entirely different position [from you on that Commission; we were there as free and independent [persons.Mr. Herbert Smith : As conservative as it was possible to be. The Chairman : At any rate, free and independent. Air. Cook: That is a wonderful explanation.The Chairman : I am putting the view of the Mining Association and not any personal views ; although, as I think I have said before, my personal views and those of the two other coal owners who were with me on the 1919 Corn-mission coincide absolutely with the views-Mr. Cook : You have changed.The Chairman : Yes, absolutely. A man who is not prepared to change his opinion when he is convinced he is wrong well-Mr. Phillips : He is not free and independent.Mr. Cook : Then there is some hope for the coalowners.The Chairman : I should like to think that there was as much hope for you as there is for them.Well, seriously, as I have said, we do still hold to the views that we put before the Commission, that the change which is contemplated here is not going to benefit the industry to the extent of a single halfpenny. It is not going to help the position, certainly not on the 1st of May ; and when the thousand e and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands have been spent, which is necessary to get the valuation of those minerals and in the course of soms years, when the State has acquired the ownership, we do not think that then it would be any advantage to the industry at all, but that we shall be a great deal more hampered than we are at the present time through having State control of a very large estate in the country, and a rigidity in their methods of dealing with the colliery companies under their leases which will be detrimental, in our view, to the prosperity of the industry. But we say at once that it is a question not for us or for you to say whether we accept or whether we do not accept. It is a question now which rests with Parliament to decide. The Government arelforfeit to accept the recommendations of the Commission in this respect, and we have got to accept that position. That is simply and plainly our attitude towards this question.Mr. Herbert Smith : I am a bit surprised to hear that speech in 1926, particularly after the revelations we got at that Commission. If anything could turn me into a revolutionist it would be that that for all time out of one pit, and it will apply to other districts besides, as long as they keep under 1,000,000 tons they have to pay 1-J-d. a ton to the people who put down the bore hole to find the coal which was already there, and when it is over 1,000,000 tons it is to be lfd. a ton for all time. You have got 12 per cent, of the royalties now, about 10 per cent, of that has been got since 1919.The Chairman : No, I think you are wrong there.Mr. Herbert Smith : As soon as there is a decision given it will put it to rights. We do not agree on the  92,000,000. The Duke of Northumberland is drawing  13 10s. every hour of the day and night out of it and doing nothing for it.
The Chairman :   He will continue to draw that.Mr. Herbert Smith : We do not agree with the  92,000,000 ; we do not agree with the  100,000,000 suggested ; but we do agree that we shall have a right to consider that position. However, we have to accept, as you sav, a political finding ; but you have been dodging it, and it is absolutely dodging it at the pit at Thorne. If anything will turn me into a revolutionist it is that l d. a ton up to 1,000,000 tons, and lfd. a ton over 1,000,000 tons for putting down a bore hole. There has been a bore hole at South Carr since 1893, and yet there is ljd. a. ton to pay.   If that is not jingoism I do not know what is.The Chairman : I do not want to argue with you the position at Thorne, but it was shown that the total royalty paid at Thorne is no greater than if, as great as, that paid at the other collieries in that neighbourhood where there is no charge to any boring company or anyone else.Mr. Cook : That makes it all the worse.The Chairman : The expense to the industry of the royalty at Thorne is no greater than it would have been if there had been leases on similar lines to those others. But that is not a matter we need take up any time over. We think this change would be detrimental to the industry. Yoy say that some ofthe people ought not to be paid for their property ; but the position as I think you put it is exactly the same as I have put it; it is not a matter now that rests with you and us to take any decision upon ; it is in the lap of the gods, if I may so describe a matter which is the subject of a decision by Parliament.After a Short Adjournment.The Chairman : At the adjournment we learnt with very great regret that one of (shall I say ?) our members-  (hear, hear) of this joint conference has been taken seriously ill and has had to go to hospital this morning. I refer to Mr. Paul McKenna. I am sure it would be your desire that we should send to him our very best wishes for his early recovery and our sympathy with him in the mishap that has occurred to him.   (Hear, hear.)Agreed.Mr. W. P. Richardson : I might say that he will not be detained in the hospital; the doctor thinks it is desirable that he should get back home. It is really a nervous breakdown from which he is suffering.The Chairman : I think Mr. Smith, before we go on into a further examina-tion of these points we might arrange our procedure for this afternoon and to-morrow. If we could get through our preliminary consideration of the remaining points and exchange views upon them by, say, about 4 o&apos;clock this afternoon I understand Mr. Cook wants to get away at 4 o&apos;clock we coidd then on our side sit down and put into writing for your consideration our views upon all the questions that we have been discussing. We should have to take a little time in the morning ourselves to go through them, to give them final approval, and we could hand them to you here somewhere between half-past 10 and 11, just for you to look over, and then we might meet as soon after 11 o&apos;clock as is possible, consider them again, and give you any explanations you might desire and ask from you any explanations that we might want upon your views, so that we might have something definite and concrete before we separate this week. If that meets with your approval we might proceed on those lines.

There has been a bore hole at South Carr since 1893, and 1yet there is 1-Jd. a ton to pay.   If that is not jingoism I do not know what is. 1The Chairman : I do not want to argue with you the position at Thorne, 1but it was shown that the total royalty paid at Thorne is no greater than if, as great as, that paid at the other collieries in that neighbourhood where there is I j no charge to any boring company or anyone else.Mr. Cook : That makes it all the worse.The Chairman : The expense to the industry of the royalty at Thorne is !no greater than it would have been if there had been leases on similar lines to jthose others.

45591The Chairman : We had got, I think, to the second point on page 233  Amalgamations of Existing Mines. I do not know to what extent you feel this is a question which should be discussed between us. It is a matter, as set down here, which rests very largely upon the action which Parliament may take on the question of the nationalisation of the mineral. It also rests, in our opinion, to a considerable extent upon our own attitude towards it. I do not know whether I might ask you to express your views upon this question to see how far you consider it is one which we could go into in any detail together before I say anything more about our views upon it.Mr. Herbert Smith : I think that if we are going through this Report carefully we should expect you people to express some opinion even on this.The Chairman :   We intend to ; but-Mr. Herbert Smith : And to express them before any action of the Government at all. Because unless you people are willing people for these amalgamations I do not see what effect they will have unless you meet them open-heartedly and discuss them as such and agree them as such. We have our fears, if it has to be a question of amalgamation, as to how far it will help or how far it is not going to help. We should like to hear what your views are upon it; because sometimes amalgamations can become monopolies. We have to admit that at once. But if we are going to be taken into this business under amalgamation and have a voice in it as to how it is going to be run, and so on, and going to be safeguarded by Act of Parliament I do not object to an Act of Parliament then it might put a different face on it altogether.The Chairman : I do not know that we have noticed any very keen desire on your part in the past to encourage amalgamations between collieries and the formation of large units. In some respects I think we might justifiably come to the conclusion that you did not view with any great favour the formation of combines of this sort; and I should hardly think it is a question upon which you could very well be brought in in any action that might be taken. We strongly uphold the view that the Commission have expressed, that anything in the nature of compulsory amalgamation on arbitrary lines would be mis-chievous. We further hold the view that if any of these amalgamations are going to be to the benefit of the industry as a whole, they should arise spontaneously out of the industry itself in the future, as they have done in the past.We have no very high opinion of the value of interference from any State body on questions of this kind. We adhere pretty well to the opinions which we expressed before the Commission on matters of this kind, that where it has been shown that amalgamations are desirable they had, generally speaking, been brought about, and that they will in the future, perhaps even to a considerably greater extent than in the past, be brought about from the pressure of events and the stress of circumstance in the industry. To that extent, I think, the industry as a whole has quite a sympathetic attitude towards them, in so far as they may be brought about voluntarily in that direction.Now, the recommendation of the Commission brings in the State as the intended future mineral owner as another party, and suggests that I presume in the Bill which will provide for the nationalisation of the minerals powers for the State, when it has acquired the minerals to bring pressure to bear where it is shown to be desirable that these amalgamations should take place. On the value of State interference I think I have already expressed our view ; but I think that phase of the question is not one which arises for discussion between us and you, any more than the general question of the nationalisation of the minerals themselves arises.   It is a matter which will have to be
discussed in Parliament if and when the Bill for the nationalisation is introduced ! and such powers as will be contemplated to endow the State with; in regard to l them will naturally require very careful watching,  and I do not know that 1 beyond saying that we can be called upon to express any further views at the 1 present moment.Mr. Herbert Smith : Except that, does not your reply amount to this, 1 that exactly as we have proceeded in the past we intend to proceed in the 1 future ?   You know that between you and us there is a big difference of i opinion.   We believe that the industry ought to be one unit belonging to the State.   We have got ruled out on that for the time being.   The next thing is as to amalgamations, and we have these people&apos;s expression, and you drop ou some words here and use them, &quot; Any general measure of compulsory amalgamation, on arbitrary lines, would be mischievous.&quot;   There may be other i things that we say are very mischievous in this report ; but if we are going to I express it like that because we know there is a difference between us as to who I should own this mineral, and we have to go on as in the past, that means we I have to go on grinding and sitting down and seeing the possibilities under the i present system as you are working it, the industry not paying the wages it i ought to pay to the people wdio work in it.   If you say you believe in those words j and &quot; you ought to trust us,&quot; I am rather driven back again to my Committee&apos;.? opinion wdiich I agree with which is that the report of this Commission is opposed to nationalisation but does not give any real grounds why it is opposed, in my opinion, to the scheme we put clown, and it is trying to build up again private enterprise at the expense of the workers in this industry.   If we have to trust to that we have a poor promise for the future.   Because it is true- that &quot;where amalgamations have suited people they have taken place.   I was surprised to hear you make the statement that we have expressed opinions against them ;  I do not know that the Miners&apos; Federation has expressed any opinion against them.The Chairman : Not so much expressed an opinion as the attitude.Mr. Herbert Smith : Take the attitude. We know that amalgamations are going on. The people who belong to the mines in one county arc interested in mines in three or four other counties. We should like to know really who are the employers who are employing us and to what extent amalgamation is going on. There is a firm which suggests in their annual report they have arranged to sell a certain colliery ; negotiations have been going on in another county, but it still belongs to the Yorkshire people although it is outside Yorkshire ; we did not know&apos; it was belonging to Yorkshire until we saw they w-ere going to sell it again. We want to know whether you people really intend to amalgamate and show us some practical way as to how you are going to do it.   We think it is up to you to tell us that now.The Chairman : I think it must be obvious to you that any questions of this kind which deal with the property of individuals must be outside the scope, of any action that the Mining Association can take.Mr. Herbert Smith : What is there in that statement ? Does that mean that we have simply to sit on this side of the table and you people will do as you like, and if there is any wage for us we shall take it, and it there is not, we shall not ? Are not we part of the industry ? Are. not we going to have some prospect as to &quot;what the industry will do, and are not we going to try to accomplish that end ?The Chairman : As long as the ownership of the undertaking remains in the hands of individuals or of companies the disposal of their property must, I think you will agree, like that of every other property, be a matter for the individuals themselves, and cannot be dictated in any way by any action that
4753any body such as the Mining Association or such as any of the district Coal-owners&apos; Associations can take any part in. We hold the view that wholesale amalgamations without regard to the particular circumstances of the individual case, which can only be known to the individuals concerned in those particular cases that any action which is taken except by those people would not promote either efficiency or increased prosperity in the industry. We stated our views on the main question of amalgamation very clearly and quite frankly. Our opinions remain the same that any action from outside would he detrimental rather than beneficial. But it rests with Parliament, when a Bill for the nationalisation of the royalties comes before it, to decide after all what powers it will grant to the State as mineral owners to interfere with existing leases.Mi&apos;. Herbert Smith : Is that as far as we can get with you people 1 Because if it is, again I say you leave us in this position. You must let us go on as we are, please, and see how far we can take you along this way. As a matter of fact, amalgamations have not been dealt with as a question of one colliery working adjacent to another ; there have been amalgamations of collieries 50 miles apart. It has been a question of which is the best and, &quot; I must have my finger in this and my finger in that.&quot; Amalgamation means really what it means amalgamations of a district with a district. You do not get that. You gave us some vivid pictures before the Commission, and we gave you a plan to show how foolish any amalgamation of that kind was, how vague it was, and not productive of what we were after. If you simply say that this Commission has made this recommendation, and that that is as far as you are prepared to go to work to do what Parliament says you have to do, we had better all put ourselves in that position and say we will wait and see what Parliament is going to do.The Chairman : Look at it from a practical point of view. What possible action could the Miners&apos; Federation, or the Mining Associations in the different districts, or the Coalowners&apos; Associations in the different districts, take in regard to a matter of this kind ? As long as the property remains in the hands of private ownership it must be left to those who own the different properties to decide as to what they can do with them. For instance, say for the sake of argument we were purely and simply to agree that this was a question which you and we could discuss together. What possible practical action could we take with regard to a matter of this kind ? It must, in our opinion, be left to those who own the property, to deal with it. If the State becomes the owner of the minerals according to the Commission^ suggestions, they may exercise some influence where they think that desirable amalgamations are being frustrated from some cause or other from some cause which they can remedy. I do not&apos; think it is possible to go beyond that.Mi-. Frank Varley : But, as Mr. Smith has pointed out, this question is not inseparably bound up -with the ownership of the minerals. It is a question of economic utility. You ask, what can the Mining Association do ? The Mining Association can do with this aspect of the Report as with many others. It has put its point of view, and that view has gone by the board in the finding of the Commission. Whether the Mining Association could say : &quot; We accept that finding ; we have no power over the private property of any constituent of ours and he will take such action as he deems desirable as and -when action is contemplated against him to make him do something which he does not assent to at that time &quot; he will not have the support of the Mining Association because we are bound by the findings of the Commission.&apos;&apos; Further, we do not ask you to commit yourselves, but we have the right to expect you will do that.
Mr. Cook : On page 44, under the headings of &quot; Organisation of the Industry &quot; and &quot; Structure of the Industry &quot; they have laid it out in some detail until you come to page 52 where they quote friend Markham particularly  a friend of the owners and not our friend-The Chairman : I think as a general principle we allow you to choose your friends, and you must allow us to choose ours.Mr. Cook : Even though that be true statements are made here very extensively and the reasons given. Especially in dealing with modern minino-conditions which show up the great variations which you are always ready to stress in regard to wages but which you are not willing to recognise as reo-ards the conditions and efficiency of the undertakings.The Chairman : I do not think there is anything, or there is not much at any rate, in Mr. Varley&apos;s statement that we would not be prepared to say we were in general agreement with. But the Commission at no point indicates that this is a question which the Mining Association and the Miners&apos; Federation can deal with as two bodies.Mr. Cook : Does not this come in with the re-organisation, where that statement is, &quot; Before any sacrifices are made &quot; ?The Chairman : Accepting that, there is no indication anywhere that the Commission contemplates that you and we should sit down and consider how or what amalgamation should be brought about.Mr. Frank Varley : But I think the position should be cleared. You are giving us the views of the Mining Association on certain points in matters which concern you and us. There are other matters which concern the Government. Now you expect from us our point of view at some later date. Does your attitude now mean that as and when we have given you that, and that as and when you have given us yours, either party will then be free to accept legislation on the other points in the House irrespective of what we have pledged to one another across this table.The Chairman : If there is any question upon which you and we come to an agreement I think it naturally follows that that point of view should be expressed to the Government, and it no doubt will have a very large influence upon the action that the Government may take. That refers to those points upon which it is contemplated thatyou and we should have any power to deal with at aE.On this question of amalgamations we regard it, and I think the Commission regarded it, as a matter which must rest, subject to such interference as the State may be empowered to bring to bear afterwards, with the owners of the collieries, it is desirable to amalgamate. Where amalgamations are desirable, and where they would benefit the industry, I think you may take it we are in general sympathy with that point of view.Mr. Herbert Smith : Yes. But does not your statement again amount to this, that you leave us to ponder out these things ? Mr. Cook has drawn your attention to a very important paragraph, and I do not want that paragraph to be missed. We have had it a time or two, and it appears on page 229. AH4 these things that are being suggested are dependent on re-organisation. I submit to you this is one of the most important things re-organisation-that there is. If you look at the figures, they find the little mines and the big mines and methods of how they work out it is one of the most important things and I think we ought to have from you people a statement as to whether you are in favour of this and will support this, and any measure before Parliament, for amalgamations in this industry.
49593The Chairman : I think if we consider this paragraph by itself, which I take it is intended to sum up the views of the Commission upon this point  we might read it through and see what they say.Mr. Cook : On page 58, they deal with the question. They put this: forward : &quot;Is the initiative of the industry itself sufficient ? &quot; Then they point out very clearly that it is not; that there is only a combination that has-been arrived at very slowly, and not many, and of course they try to defend, the owners by saying : &quot; It is contended that the conditions of the trade in recent years have not been propitious for combinations of this character, which usually involve the provision of new capital.&quot; They suggest some-defence there.But at the same time, they point out really through that on page 59, that judging by the past the initiative in the industry is not sufficient. You say definitely that this is not a matter for either the Mining Association, and certainly you imply not a matter for the Miners&apos; Federation, when the whole paragraph read by Mr. Smith in regard to re-organisation affects this very clearly and definitely.The Chairman : The only additional spur (if I may use the word) which the Commission suggest is practicable to expedite such amalgamations as are-desirable is through the action of the State when it becomes the owner of the minerals and can deal with the leases as lessor. There is nothing else that the Commission suggests.Mr. Thomas Richards : If you look at page 62, the summing-up of the-whole thing, they put the whole case as to how they are to be dealt with,, where they are thought to be desirable and otherwise (a) and (b) and; (on the Chairman : In that there is nothing which suggests that the two organisations can have any say at all in the matter.Mr. Thomas Richards : No, I am not saying that.The Chairman : We are considering here between ourselves such things as you and we, as the organisations, either as a whole or in detail, throughout the country, can take any part in.Mr. Herbert Smith : I do not want to repeat myself ; but we cannot put this off ; it is one of the main fundamental principles in this tiling, and it is provided for at page 229 where it says that it is contingent on certain things being done before the miner is to be asked to make some sacrifice. Before we can be talking to you of any sacrifice, or before he can agree to make any, we want to know what is really in your minds, and what you mean with regard to this thing.The Chairman : That is what we have been endeavoiuing to convey to you. Let us read what the paragraph says : &quot; The amalgamation of many of the present small units of production &quot; it does not say all of them &quot; is both desirable and practicable &quot; we would not go so far as to say that that is not true, that there are many in which it is desirable and practicable, and we think that there is no doubt that the conditions which we shall have to face Sin the future will make it imperative upon owners to adopt such measures as will enable them to carry on their collieries profitably ; and if the owners of a certain number of small units in any district find that it is desirable and that it is practicable to carry out these amalgamations they will do so.Mr. Cook : But have they done so ? It says here, &quot; Here the experience of more recent years &quot; and those are the years about which you have been complaining in regard to your profits &quot; has not been encouraging. The process of fusion appears to have come almost to a standstill.&quot; That is clear and definite.
&apos; The Chairman : Yes, but I do not think that is strictly true. There are, 1 think there is no doubt, contemplated amalgamations which are beinf negotiated even at the present time, between owners ; and all that they suggest -that can be done to stimulate, to expedite, these things is when the State becomes the owners of the minerals it can exercise some amount of compulsion where amalgamations are prevented; where there is a desire to amalgamate but it is prevented by the dissent of some of the parties, then they contemplate that the State can step in and bring some effective pressure to bear. That is clearly a question which can only arise in connection with the terms upon which Parliament decides that the State shall become the owner of the minerals.Mr. Herbert Smith : If that is your considered opinion, and of the associations behind you, I want to say that this meeting is too soon ; because &quot;we ought to see what is really going to be done with regard to this before we get any further in this direction. Because if we are going to be asked to do anything to meet this position we ought to know what is going to be offered to us in return. To me this is one of the most important things in this whole movement; when I see the little pettifogging pits knocking about with five or six owners and four or five sons living out of them, watching about 20 men work, it is simply stagnation and you have hundreds of them up and down the country. There is no method. You are seeking amalgamation with a big-pit here and a big pit there ; but there is no amalgamation to prevent unnecessary expenditure and unnecessary sinkings. There -would be less shafts needed if things were better distributed. There is none of that. If your statement is correct that we have to wait for legislation, then I say our wages equally as well cannot be moved until we get that legislation to tell us what we shall get in return for it.The Chairman : What, in your opinion, is there that can be done by either you or us in regard to a matter of this kind ? What reply do you expect can be given to you upon this question other than the one I have given, that this recommendation says very definitely : &quot; The amalgamation of many of the present small units of production &quot; it does not say all of them &quot; is both desirable and practicable. This may oiten be effected from within, but in many cases it will only take place if outside assistance is given.&quot; The only outside assistance that is contemplated is assistance through State inter-ference. Then it goes on to say : &quot; Any general measure of compulsory amalgamation, on arbitrary lines, would be mischievous ; the action to be taken should be elastic and should enable each case to be treated individually.&quot; You do not contemplate that the treatment of those cases should be a question for discussion between the organisations in the districts on the two sides.Mr. Herbert Smith : We contemplate this, and I think wre have a right to contemplate it, that you people if you talk about this Commission and its findings, will tell us straight out without any hesitation at all as to whether you accept it and intend carrying out to the letter the various things.Mr. Thomas Richards : If you will put us in possession of the facts we will tell, you afterwards ; we will undertake to tell you, but we have not tho information. We cannot tell how far amalgamation of certain concerns with others would reduce the cost 0* production ; we have reason to believe it would do it very considerably, but we have not the information. You give it to us and -we will tell you.The Chairman : We have not got the information either.Mr. Thomas Richards : But this Commission has suggested it should be obtained both by you and others.
The Chairman : It does not suggest anything of the kind. It says&apos; &quot; This may often he effected from within, but in many cases it will only take-place if outside assistance is given.&quot; Then it goes on to say : &quot; The State as mineral owner will be able to promote desirable amalgamations when granting new leases or renewing old ones. Legislation should provide for a compulsory transfer of interests under existing leases where desirable amalgamations,&quot; etc. That is action which can only be contemplated, which can only be brought about, in connection with the Act of Parliament, when it is passed, which nationalises the minerals and lays down the terms upon which the State will be authorised to proceed as the owner of the minerals.Mr. Varley : But seeing you have the pledge of the Government that they will adopt that recommendation, then that need not concern us. We assume that will automatically come about. Then what is going to be your attitude ?The Chairman : If Parliament legislates upon those lines we shall have-to accept the Act of Parliament and make the best of it, and do all in our power to assist in bringing about such measures as will be proved to be of value to the industry. But they are clearly even then not questions which the organisation as such can deal with ; they will be matters entirely between the State as lessor and the different colliery owners as lessees.Mr. Thomas Richards : It is your lack of faith and your unwillingness to express any attempt or desire to see that some improvement can be made in this direction. It has been in my mind, from your last statement where you assumed we were hostile, that we had previously been hostile to these amalgama-tions, and that we were still in that position. We have to look at amalgamation from two points of view. Yes, we are hostile in the sense that we have a stronger body to wrestle with than when we have small ownerships, in regard to wages and conditions, and so forth. But here is this Commission, after its inquiry, solemnly putting it up to you that economies can be secured by greater mass production and by having some regard to those various adjoining each other that are working the same property and hauling coal long distances where it could be brought up shorter distances, and so forth. Is it not a subject which you think ought to be further explored, and it is only you who could get the information ?The President : I think we declared quite specifically that there is no hostility on our part to amalgamations. We have said quite definitely that there are cases where amalgamations are desirable.Mr. Varley : In the opinion of whom %The Chairman : In the opinion of those who have the power of dealing with them . There is no power at present in the hands of anyone, except those who own the properties, to bring this about, or, as I say again, that the State, when it becomes a party to the ownership of the mineral which is being worked, can help to promote such amalgamations as may be proved to be desirable.Mr. Varley : But then the suggestion is not that the State should interfere qua lessor. They will interfere qua the guardian of the coal interests of the country, which includes the standard of living of the people who work the coal mines ; and that involves the question of the utility of the undertakings, and it is from that point of view that they propose to come in, At the top of page (il they say, in paragraph 5, &quot;Where one or more undertakings in an area desired to effect an amalgamation, but others, whose co-operation was necessaiy, refused, or demanded unreasonable terms, there must be power in the public interest to over-ride such opposition&quot;. All we are saying to 3*011 is, what do you say in regard to the proposal of someone to take these powers ?   You say
You say, if the State is goingthat is no concern of ours, it is a concern simply of the owner of the property which it is proposed to take. We say to you as a Mining Association you either accept this Report or you do not. On this particular aspect of it, what do you do ?. The Chairman : I thought we were agreed that as you were not in a position to-day to say whether you accepted or whether you rejected a good many of Tthese things, we ought not to be put in the position of having to say definitely on questions of this kind what our attitude is.Mx. Varley : If you put it like that, that is a different thing.The Chairman : I think we expressed our views quite definitely that there are amalgamations which may be desirable. We are not opposed to amalgama-tion in principle. We said before the Commission that in our view those ought &quot;to be left for purely voluntary action. The Commission has expressed the opinion that some stimulus other than exists at the present moment should be provided, and that stimulus should be brought about through the nationalisa-tion of the minerals by the State. That is where the position stands. We adopt the same attitude towards the Commission^ recommendation in this respect as we adopt in regard to the Commission^ recommendation with regard to the nationalisation of the minerals.Mr. Herbert Smith : It is a very unsatisfactory attitude ; it does not appeal to me ; because I have to judge people as I have known them all my life. You say sometimes people change. But your statement has not changed at all now from what it was before the Commission. You do not say, &quot; We approve of it and will lend our aid to it in every way &quot; ; you say this property is the individual people&apos;s own and they have the right to do with it as they like, and nothing more. We say if there is going to be any question of the workmen having to submit anything which is not fair to ask them to submit to, they want to know what they are going in get in return for the sacrifice they are making.The Chairman : What do you suggest the owners as a body could do in a question of this kind ? There has been no positive or definite suggestion of any kind from you as to what the owners as a body could do in dealing with this matter. The Commission do not suggest there is anything the Owners as a body can do. They do not suggest there is anything the Miners&apos; Federation can do in this matter. To a point they agree with us that where these things can be clone spontaneously and voluntarily they shall be done. If there is any obstruction to carrying out desirable amalgamations, then the State, as mineral owner, may come in and provide that stimulus, and to the extent even of cornpulsorily manipulating leases in order that these amalgama-tions may be brought about.Mr. Cook : Who will decide the desirability ?The Chairman : Certainly not the Mining Association or the Miners&apos; Federation.Mr. Cook : Then they will never take place, to interfere where they are desirable-The President :  Only after careful consideration.Mr. Cook : By whom ?The President : Not by the coalowners or by the Miners&apos; Federation, but by such body as the State may put up to deal with the question from their point of view.
595Mr. thomas Eichaeds : You do not suggest, do you, that the State in purchasing the royalties are going to interfere at all with the present obligations of the royalty owners to the colliery owners.The chairman : The Commission contemplate that the State should be given power to provide for the compulsory transfer of interests under existing leases where desirable amalgamations are prevented by the dissent of some of the parties or their unreasonable claims.   It has to be decided, first of all---&apos;Mr. Thomas Eichaeds : The initiative is left with the parties even there.The Chairman : That is what the Commission suggests.Mr. Thomas Eichaeds : Yes, that is what I say.The chairman : The whole of the initiative under the Commission&apos;s suggestion is left to the parties, and not that the State should take action of itself in proceeding to carve out the present distribution of the properties among people. They contemplate that it has to be proved, first of all, to their satisfaction that amalgamations are desirable and are prevented from takiug place by someone, aud then so far as the State as mineral owner can intervene they propose it should intervene.Mr. Vaeley : Surely that is not the complete picture ; because on page 61 they say, &quot; There may possibly remain eases where combinations are desirable, but where the mine-owners directly concerned show themselves incapable of initiative, while there are other owners, whether in the locality or from elsewhere, who are willing to work the mineral on progressive lines.&quot; Then further clown : &quot; On the whole, we recommend that the legislation that &quot;ivould be needed to give effect to these proposals in general should include a provision of the character described; but that this provision should not come into effect upon the passing of the Act, but at a specified later date, perhaps after three years ; and then only if a statement is made by the Mines Department that it is satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest to bring it into operation, so that in some circumstances, possibly against the wish of everyone connected with these undertakings, the Mines Department might forward a project for the amalgamation of the whole of them, and this power shall be given to the State to bring about such an amalgamation. If that is the correct rendition of this paragraph, what has the Mining Association to say about that ?The Chairman : All that the Muring Association can say is that if Parliament in its wisdom, or otherwise, decides that power shall be given in this way, they will have to accept the position.Mi&apos;. Varley : It is not so clear. With great respect, I venture to say this is hedging.The Chairman : No, Mr. Varley^, I challenge you absolutely to prove that there is any question of hedging about it.Mi&apos;. Varley : All you have said, boiled down, means that the Mining Association believes in the policy of non-interference in this matter; that amalgamations, so far as they are any good at all, ought to come about voluntarily, and you ought to be left alone; and presumably, per contra, if any other method than that is suggested, you, as a Mining Association will oppose it in Parliament or elsewhere.The Chairman : We have not said that.Mr. Varley : But that is the implication.The Chairman : I do not think you are entitled to draw any inference at all of that character. We have to accept what Parliament decides on a question of this kind,   If it becomes the law of the land we have to abide by
it; and you people, who are represented fully in Parliament, whereas we have no representation at all, will be in a position to exercise more influence than we can.Mr. W. P. richardson : Do you agree with the Commission^ findings that on the figures they have examined and they say they have examined some exhaustive figures on this that amalgamations of larger units prove conclusively the costs are less and the output is greater throughout. Does the Coalowners&apos; Association accept that as laid down ?The Chairman : I say definitely that the Commission have not proved that an. amalgamation, or that a group of small mines which is to-day amalgamated, is more efficient than individual small mines which are left to work on their own. All it has shown is that, taking the statistics of the country as a whole, there are large collieries which make greater profits than small ones.Mr. W. P. Richardson : They do more than that.The chairman: There is nothing in the Commission^ report which gives any figures at all or which gives any evidence of what is the comparative position of a group of small mines as compared with individual small mines. There is nothing at all.Mr. W. P. Richardson : Do not they say there is a difference of three cwts. per shift ?The Chairman : Not as between a group of small mines and individual small mines. They do not say anything of that kind at all. They make comparisons between undertakings.of all sizes, and it is obvious that the large undertakings are composed of large pits.Mr. Cook : Not necessarily so. Amalgamations may have many small pits which they have, of course, in many cases.The Chairman : They do not differentiate in any way at all between a group say a group raising half a million tons from one pit or from two pits or from ten pits they lump the whole thing ; and there is nothing in the Report of the Commission which would prove that, say, ten small pits working together produce better results than individual small pits.Mr. varley : We are not discussing that now, are we&apos;?The chairman : I did not intend to discuss it until Mr. Richardson raised the point.Mr. varlet : We are discussing their conclusions, and their conclusions are that amalgamations are desirable in many instances.The.. Chairman : With that we agree.Mr. Varley : That if they are brought about voluntarily, so much tho better, and the employers should be given three years in which to bring their heads together, but at the end of the three years the legislation should come into force because otherwise the position might be prejudiced. All we are saying on this report is : Do you accept it as freely as you accept the onus ol not wanting to destroy the industry and other things ?The chairman : I do not know that I am called upon to accept or reject that in any way. We agree with what the Commission say, that there are amalgamations which are desirable. We say, further, that if the State, after a waiting period, or without a waiting period, decides that it should come in as mineral owner and influence amalgamations that are proved to be desirable but which are being obstructed, then, if that is the law of the land, we have to abide by it.   I do not think we can say any more.
596Mr. COOK : But they go further to support Mr. Richardson. On page 52 they say &quot; All entitled to speak on such a matter with high authority held the opinion that benefits would be obtained in a number of cases if the industry were worked by undertakings on a large scale. The only expert witness who spoke in a contrary sense was Mr. F. Parker Rhodes, a mine-owner.The Chairman : That was in 1919.Mr. Cook : Yes ; I am sorry.Sir Adam Nimmo : May I draw attention to this, that I think Mr. Smith and his colleagues are overlooking the second and third paragraphs on page 58, where the general principles are laid down upon which the recommendation on page 233 is based. It is quite clear that the first part of the recommendation under No. 2 on page 233 merely embodies the principles laid down in the second and third paragraphs on page 58.Mr. Varley : And 59 and 60.Sir Adam Nimmo : Those principles are clearly stated. Mr. Cook : Go further.Sir Adam Nimmo :   Perhaps you might read these paragraphs.The Chairman : Yes I think it would be an advantage if we read them.Mr. Cook : Before you read the paragraphs, may I say that Sir Adam has eliminated altogether the answer to the question: &quot; Is the initiative of the industry itself sufficient ? &quot;The Chairman : Is it not far more important to read the first one : &quot; Are amalgamations among the older collieries desirable?&quot; &quot;With regard to the second question, whether it may not be too late now to effect amalgamations in our older coalfields, we observe that several important fusions, or arnalgama-tions by purchase, have in fact been made at various dates in the present century. The cases are familiar to those who are acquainted with the industry. With few exceptions, there are no differences of opinion as to the utility of these combinations, and if anyone were now to propose to dissolve them into their original parts, it would be universally regarded as a retrograde step&quot; that we generally agree with at the same time we consider that it has been established that any general measure of compulsory grouping on uniform or arbitrary lines is open to grave objection. We have outlined the argu-monts that are advanced by the opponents of such a measure, and we think that they are cogent. We should be unable to recommend a policy of of amalgamation if it were to take that character The answer, then, to the second question is that a number of amalgamations have in fact been effected in the older coal-fields, and with advantage ; that they are therefore clearly not impracticable ; but that not in every case is amalgamation desirable.; and that to compel parties, who object to it, to work together in a combined undertaking would be a mistaken policy.&quot;   That we agree with.Mr. Herbert Smith : I think you do ; I think you will agree with anything like that. But you forget the other factor, as I keep on reminding you. You have to remember this, that all these recommendations are based on. certain things before the miner is called upon to do anything. If you are in the position of saying &quot; Let us do as we like and await events,&quot; I want to say that we cannot discuss anything further, because we must have either approval or opposition.The Chairman : I do not think it is necessary, on a question which does not rest with you or us, for us to express our approval or disapproval in specific terms.    We have the recommendation of the Commission here;  to a large&quot;
Ifextent, we agree with it ; and to the extent to which they say it must rest with Parliament to decide, we shall have to accept that position. Is not that quite sufficient and categorical enough answer to give to your question ?Mr. vaeley: No; because it leaves it open to us to say this, when we come to district minima or to deal with the quantum, we should then have to do so-and-so if Parliament says so ; we. shall have to accept it, implying that we should do all we possibly could in the meantime to prevent them saying so. But that is not taking it very far.The Chairman : We have not said that.Mr. varley: But it leaves you free to. take that action from what you [fj have just said.The Chairman : Are you going to give up your freedom to take any action when questions come before Parliament, and any line is suggested with which you disagree ?Mr. Varley : Following your action to-day, certainly not.Mr. chairman : Do not take it on a question of general policy like that. If your action is governed or dictated in any way by what we do, are you going to give up your liberty to speak in Parliament on a question of this kind ?Mr. Vaeley : What we said in Parliament would largely have to be governed by the tentative agreement entered into here between the two sides.The chairman :  What tentative agreement do you suggest you have entered into on a question of this kind ?Mr. Vaeley : That the Mining Association will accept this part of the recommendations of the Commission which says that in certain circumstances amalgamations are desirable, and a Parliamentary power should be sought to put them into operation, and the Mining Association will not oppose that.The chairman : I do not think we are called upon to go to that extent between us and you. It is exactly the same position as with regard to the nationalisation of royalties; we hold the view that it will not be to the advantage of the industry. If Parliament decides, we have to accept the position.Sir Adam Nimmo : May I say to Mr. Varley that the recommendation does not go to that length, because it is based, as I suggest, upon the second and third paragraphs on page 58.Mr. Vaeley : But you must know that the second and third paragraphs oa page 58 deal with only one aspect of four. It is addressing itself there to the one question : Are amalgamations desirable ? It addresses itself to three other aspects of the same question, and their conclusions are based upon a summary of the whole, and not upon the reply to that one part of the question.The Chairman : I think I can only say again, as I have said before, that we agree that there are amalgamations which would be desirable.Mr. Thomas Richards : And will take the necessary steps to bring them about ?The chairman : There is no step that the Mining Association, as such, or any district Coalowners&apos; Association, as such, can take to bring about amalgamations of that kind. The only outside influence that can be brought to bear is that of Parliament when it has nationalised the minerals.Mr. varley : But there are steps which they could refrain from taking &quot;which can possibly retard amalgamations.
597The Chairman : There is no desire T say this quite categorically and definitely on the part of the Mining Association to retard amalgamations in any shape or form.   Is not that quite a sufficient declaration on this point ?Mr. COOK: You have made your statement previously quite clear.Mr. Chairman : I suggest now we should go on to No. 3.Mr. Herbert Smith : We are not leaving that question with the idea that we are satisfied with your answer. We are taking your answer as it is on the Notes; but it will not meet me, and I want to say that perfectly clearly.The Chairman : I do not think we started out to-day with the idea of agreeing upon everything the Commission has reported, did we ?Now, &apos;.&apos; Combination of Industries.&quot; They say, &quot; The closer connection of mining with the right industry should be promoted.&quot; On that point, I think the general tendency on our part has been to get closer association between our industries and the coal-consuming industries. We have heard from your side that these associations are mischievous, and ought not to exist. That was not our view at the time;. it is not the view that the Commission have taken ; and we are in entire agreement with the views of the Commission on this point.If any useful purpose can be served by a National Fuel and Power Committee with advisory powers, we shall be quite prepared to accept such assistance as a body of that kind can give to us.Mr. Herbert Smith : I want to take exception to your first few words. You keep implying things ; I do not know why. You keep implying we have done so-and-so and so-and-so. We have done nothing of the sort. What we have said is this : We ought to know what is happening in these industries, because we are satisfied and these figures go to prove it that we have suffered at the expense of these industries being allied to the trade in the way they are. You say to every advance we make &quot; All you have to do is to produce coal ; how it is utilised is a question separate and apart from you.&quot; I do know that we do not agree with you. We say if they are going to be connected they ought to be connected in the strict sense of the words so that we know where the line of demarcation comes. You have coke ovens, by-products, iron and steel, belonging to the same industry, transferring labour here and there. No one will satisfy me that these figures have been got with accuracy.The chairman : You are on another point which will arise when we -come to the question of transfer prices.Mr. Herbert Smith: I am not talking about transfer prices. I see a man working at the coke oven at 20 past 8 and at the pit head after 9 o&apos;clock.The Chairman : That is a view which you placed before the Commission, and the Commission had it in their mind in drawing up their report. They have made recommendations in regard to the relations between the colliery end and any other end that there may be of combined industries. When we come to the question of transfer prices we will indicate to you what our view is upon that; but I do not think there is any more that I can say on this question of No. 3 than I have said. The question of demarcation is one which the Commission have quite clearly laid down.Mr. Varley : Except that in introducing it you said we had stated that these combinations were mischievous. We have not said that. We have complained about the financial arrangements which exist,The chairman : I do not want to leave that if it rankles in your minds. I am referring to a whole morning we spent on the point in the Sub-Committee some months ago, when we were told by you that the association
of coal with iron and steel and with shipbuilding and with many other things was detrimental to the industry, and at that time we endeavoured to point out to you that it was beneficial.Mr. DAVIBS : It is your policy to charge us with objecting to these associations. What we have said is what our President has told you, that such associations are being used to the prejudice of the wages of our men. That is a world of difference.The Chairman: If it is your view that you are not opposed to the association of coal with other industries, then we accept it frankly, and L am prepared to withdraw anything I have said that is contrary to that view. The question of the effect of this association upon the wages is one which depends entirely on the question of transfer prices.Mr. Thomas Richards : When you come to assess our wages we shall say we are justified in bringing them in and not taking simply the raw coal on which to have our wages assessed.The Chairman : We have the Commission^ definite statement that coke ovens and by-product plants and other forms for the utilisation of coal must be kept apart from the coal-producing industry in connection with prices.Mr. Thomas Richards : If you have come here to say you would try to assess our wages without regard to them, it cannot be.The Chairman : All we are on is Question No. 3, and we express general agreement with the view of the Commission.Mr. COOK: &quot;We propose for consideration the establishment of a National Fuel and Power Committee.&quot;The Chairman: You will find what I have said on that point on the Notes.Mr. Cook :   Very well.The Chairman : No, No. 4 : Questions of Research. I do not know that I need read this through. I will simply express our general agreement with the conclusion of the Commission on this particular point of research. We approve of the principle of extended research as far as possible. We observe that they suggest that there should be some representatives of the miners on some bodies that may be set up. We have no objection to that whatsoever. We should be glad of the help of everyone, both financially and otherwise, to help us in a matter of this kind.Mr. Frank Hall :   And share the fruits.The chairman : Yes ; six-sevenths of them, at any rate. Where it is suggested in connection with research that a State Department should come in to direct and control. I think at that stage we shall get your assistance.Mr. Thomas Richards :   I am sure you will.Mr. Cook :   Is it your intention that if these processes such as the low-temperature carbonisation were perfected and oil is thus extracted from coal is it your intention to treat this as you have the coke and by-products? Supposing, to put it straight, it is successful, is that to be excluded from the mining industry too ?The Chairman : Yes. The whole idea is that the better utilisation of coal will give better results in the shape of better prices, I may say, for certain classes of coal which are now more or less unsaleable..Mr. Cook : So you want us to help you to get more value, so if the coal becomes more valuable the workman will become less valuable.
598The Chairman : No. If coal becomes more valuable the proceeds at the colliery will be greater and the wages paid to the men will be conse-rjuently improved.Mr. Cook : But you will treat it as a separate industry ?The Chairman: Absolutely.   Shall we now go on to No. 5, &quot;Distri-bution ? &quot;Mr. Thomas Richards : I must have a word on that other subject. You must really appreciate our position relative to these auxiliary industries that you are already interested in and presume to be interested in, and which is to have no relation to the mining industry. The workmen will be driven eventually to say : It does not matter to us what the price of coal is or what you do with it or anything else ; we do not want any relationship with you at all in a national agreement, and minima, and so forth; we must insist on getting wages and that is all.It cannot be manipulated like this long, you can depend upon it, because it is manipulation at the expense of the workmen who are getting this coal; and if you are assuming to go and do that under this suggestion of the Government, and are to become much greater allies of the other industries at the expense of tbe men who get the coal, we are not going to try to end trouble, we are only at the beginning of it.The Chairman : I do not think it is suggested that these things should be taken in hand bp the coalowners as such.Mr. Thomas Richards : No, they are such ubiquitous persons.The Chairman : If I refrain from arguing the point of view at the present moment you will not infer that we agree with what you have said? We simply take note of what you have said with regard to it.Mr. Varley: You do not refrain. You definitely replied to Mr. Cook that as and when it was brought to a successful end it would be treated as a separate undertaking. What Mr. Richards is saying is that on this matter you might keep an open mind and allow some consideration to be given to the subject as and when a success is made of it. It comes to this, what Mr; Eichards has said, that the&apos;strongest charge which can be brought against us is to call us damned arithmeticians; they say &quot; we have too much of arithmeticians and too little wages.&quot; It is no good going through all this if as soon as it brings in fruit we are not allowed to get any benefit.The Chairman : It has never been suggested that any fruit which may accrue to the industry wilt not be participated in by you to the same extent that you participate now in any improved value brought into existence by any process that is devised.Mr. Cook : You said this is to be a separate industry.The Chairman : That is what the Commission contemplate.Mr. Cook : What you contemplate.The Chairman : In that sense we accept the view of the Commission.Mr. GlLLlLAND : That means that the fruits of the industry can never come into the coal trade.The Chairman : Nothing of the kind.Mr. Gilliland : It must mean that if it is a separate department.Mr. W. P. Richardson : By consuming the coal it would probably provide work, whereas the pits might be idle. Apart from that, Lord Gainford was not prepared to move one single iota in the direction you indicate now,
that the workmen could share in the enhanced value of coal. What he definitely said was, that it was no business of ours. You will find he emphasised that when we had got the coal to the bank, at the end and every time it was pressed forward he came back to this new point, that we were getting some advantage from the fact that if the coal was not used the pits would not be working.Lord Gainford : What I said was, and what I repeated again and again in reply to Mr. Eichardson&apos;s question was, that all these improvements in connection with the use of coal enhanced the value of the coal, and it tended to raise the price, and in the raising of the price of coal the men received their interests; and all these processes were to the advantage of the miner, because the increase of price was also reflected in a higher wage for the miner.Mr. Thomas Richards : It is seen in the present depreciation that the concerns which have these opportunities are still making profits, and some of them big profits, because they have the advantage of the low rate of wages over the other people, the poorer collieries, in regard to the raw coal. That is the position, and it is no good blinking at it.The Chairman : I do not think that is strictly correct. But all I say is Mr. Thomas richards : For once our arithmeticians are correct.The Chairman : It does not arise on this point: but on that question generally our view is that the highest possible price that can be obtained for the coal should be got for the coal, and that anything which will tend to increase the price we can get for the coal should be encouraged.Mr. W. P. Richardson : Will you tell us where this enhanced price has come in at present. Is it not the fact that the waste coal is being treated and has become valuable, but is being sold at the same price as it was when there was not a market for it.lord gainford : When we were young it was put on the heap and not used at all.Mr. W. P. Richardson : Now it is just as valuable as the best coal in the pits, and which is being transferred to the works at the lowest possible prices, and we. are not getting in any case the value of it. That is what you are refusing. What has been pressed is this : the owners themselves have followed this coal into its new treatment, is there anything unreasonable in asking that the workmen should be allowed to follow also ? If it is good that the mineowner should travel there in regard to this coal so that he can get the advantages out of the treatment that is given to the coal, why should the men who produce the coal be robbed of the particular thing which has given a new value to the coal ?The Chairman : If it has given a new value to the coal, that value should be got to the colliery, and if it is got to the colliery the mineworkers will benefit by that price. I think we are getting rather off the line of our programme, you know.Mr. Thomas Richards : But we are not off the line of what is one of the most important features under these negotiations. Mr. Cook : And the future of the industry.The Chairman : It does not arise on the point we are discussing at the present moment. We are dealing with No. 4, which is the question of Research, and we have said that we are in agreement with the recommendation of the Commission upon this point.
a 0Mr. COOK : But the benfits accruing thereby you will retain for yourselves.. The chairman : No, I have not said anything of the kind. Mr. Cook : In regard to oil you have.The Chairman : Shall we go on to the next point Distribution ?]Mr. Ablett : If you keep up prices, and you say that is a separate-matter, you are up against the biggest crisis this industry has ever entered into-at all yet. Price is the one thing, so far as money is concerned, to give us-something. If you put in by-products as a small thing, the fact that you say you cannot admit them into the ascertainment it is not very small; it is very-big ; it is very big in money in many ways and that being so it is one of the-things which may perhaps solve our problem for the time being.The Chairman : May I just say that that is not the question we are-discussing. We are going through these recommendations of the Commission and indicating, as far as we can, on our side our attitude towards them.Mr. Ablett : Quite so ; and you dismiss it The Chairman : The question was the question of the inclusion Mr. Ablett : You merely said, in regard to by-products, what does it matter. Let me tell the Owners here now that if they think that is the-position they will wake up in a month or two and find a different state of things-in this country than they ever thought of at all.The Chairman : The question of whether by-product plants and coke; ovens are to be included in the ascertainment does not arise on the point we-are discussing. .Mr. Ablett : I thought it did.The Chairman : With very great respect I feel compelled to rule you oufc of order.Mr. Ablett : I have always been accused of being before my time ; but I . think the Owners will understand that as far as I am concerned there is a very-strong feeling on the matter.Mr. Herbert Smith : Let us take your answers, Mr. Chairman. We-have to formulate our own opinions when we have your answers. He is not-waving it away like that. Let us get to know what you have in your minds,, so that we can go on.   (Hear, hear.)The Chairman: The next question is Distribution. The Commission says: &quot; The industry as a whole has so far failed to realise the benefits to be-obtained by a readiness to co-operate. Large financial advances might be gained by the formation, in particular, of co-operative selling agencies. They are specially needed in the export trade.&quot; Now on this point I have to say to-you, quite frankly, that the Mining Association never has been and is not in.a. position io deal with the commercial side of this industry. Without expressing any opinion at all here to-day upon this recommendation of the Commission,, we are referring this matter to the. districts to consider for themselves. It is-only the Coalowners in the districts as Coalowners, generally speaking, and not as members of their Associations, that can deal with a question of this kind.1 We are asking them to consider the matter in the districts and to deal with the1 questions as district questions purely and simply.Mr. Herbert Smith : i am afraid we have got to rise now, because we--&apos; come up against this thing more every day. I had a letter this morning from a man who said he had asked for coal to be sent direct to him from theNewdigate Colliery, but he was referred to the London Agents. He knew that by going to the colliery and getting his coal promptly it would be 5s. cheaper for that
--specimen o  coal which he indicated than he would have to pay for it in London, allowing for the carriage. You people are crabbing this all you possibly can. You are not encouraging people to come to the colliery and buy direct. We -cannot have it relegated to the districts. We want a pronouncement from you -as aCoalowners&apos; Association. This has a national aspect; it affects us all more or less. The people who sell coal are living better than those who work in the pits or own collieries. I have known men who handle coal who at one time had nothing, and now have two Bolls Eoyces. We are tired of this business. We have to have the benefit of what the coal realises in price. If you brush it away like this, this sitting down here is not worth it. Either you will approve it in its full aspect or you will oppose it.The Chairman : All I can say on the matter is that we as Coalowners, hoth individually and collectively, are as desirous as you are to get as high a price at the pit head as can be obtained for the coal; and I feel quite sure that the Coalowners individually, and so far as they can collectively in the districts, rare prepared to consider what steps they can take to prevent what you call exploitation of the industry by middlemen or by anyone outside. I do not think that here we can usefully take up any time upon it! because, as I have said before, as a Mining Association this matter is entirely outside our scope; but. we are recommending the Coalowners in the districts to give very serious -attention to this point.Mr. Herbert Smith : And we shall get their reply, when ? Because all these things are contingent on certain things.   When shall we get a reply?Mr. Da vies : Have you hot said here we are not much more interested on the commercial side than on the productive side more interested in the ^commercial price than the pit head price so how can you expect us to believe that you are sincere in what you tell us.The Chairman : I do not know how I can answer a question as to how we can expect you to believe anything we say, I simply repeat it, and tell you .quite definitely again, that is our view and our express decision, that this matter shall be recommended to the districts for their consideration, by those who can deal with it in those districts, with a view to getting the best price &quot;for the coal at the pit head that can be got.Mr. Da vies : And their opinions, of course, will be forwarded to you, and we shall be informed later as to your attitude on them as an Association ?- The Chairman : On this matter I think that all we are asked to do here is to give this matter consideration and to do what is possible in regard to it; :and I may say we will take this matter into consideration to see what can be done, and do what is possible in regard to it.The next paragraph is : &apos; The Government should consider the establish-ment of an official system for the sampling and analysis of coal, with a view to encouraging selling on specification and guarantee, in both the home and the foreign markets.&quot; All that we have to say on that point is, that we shall welcome any assistance we can get from the Government in this respect; and if by setting up official sampling and analysing establishments at the ports or anywhere else to which they can get the acceptance of the buyers, either -abroad or at home, we think they might be conferring some benefit upon the industry. If they can set up establishments and if the foreign buyer can be induced to accept the findings of that establishment as decisive and final in regard, to any question of analysis, then I think it will be something to the advantage of us as producers and sellers of coal.
Mr. Herbert Smith : Going back to the last few words of the first sub-paragraph of No. 5 : &quot; They are specially needed in the export trade.&quot; Is it a fact that you people have been meeting German employers with regard to the question of selling export coal ?The Chairman : No, it is not a fact that we have been meeting them. If you think that any good purpose could be served by you and us meeting the ovmers and workmen in Germany and coming to agreement as to the uniform conditions in regard to the cost of producing coal, we might consider whether it would not be an advantage.Mr. Herbert Smith : I think you have largely already done that through the &quot; Daily Mail.&quot;   You have sent a deputation out to make certain inquiries.The Chairman : We were not consulted or even informed by the &quot; Daily Mail.&quot;Mr. Herbert Smith : I am putting it again. Are you suggesting doing anything in regard to export trade ? Because we did get some startling state-ments made at the Commission, as you remember, about people who were hangers-on in the export trade, how they had increased of late years, and they to live from somewhere.The Chairman : The findings of the Commission on that point are on record, but what I said did not differentiate between the export and inland trade. I should like to remind you that at meetings which were held here in this rooom in 1922 or 1923, when you urged upon us some means whereby the price of coal could be put up, you then expressed the view that as far as the export trade was concerned it was impossible to make combinations for putting up prices.Mr. Herbert Smith : When you keep making those statements, are they correct ? You keep making these statements about, what we said in 1923 and what we did not say. What I am asking you is, are they correct; because if they are, since the subvention came along, looking through this book carefully, railway contracts have gone down at least 45 per cent, for the new price of coal. That is not through foreign competition. It is home competition, as far as the railways are concerned. But I have always to remember that a certain number of you people are also interested in the railways. It is given in this book ; they are not my figures ; they are your figures largely in this book, and they show that railway contracts for coal have gone down over 45-per cent.The Chairman : I will answer the question you put at the beginning of your statement, and say that what I said with regard to this matter applies-both to export and to inland consumption.Mr. Herbert Smith : All you are doing is to relegate it to your districts for their consideration, and you are a national body. We shall have a very easy way out of this business when we have done with you. We shall sit clown and say, &quot; Gentlemen, now we have heard what you have to say, we shall relegate it to our districts and meet you again next Christmas.&quot; Because that is what we are driving to. We either want an expression of opinion nationally or we do not.The Chairman : I have expressed to you the only opinion I can express to you, that all we can do as a Mining Association is what we have done to lecommend the districts to take this matter into very serious consideration and investigate and decide upon what it is possible for them to do.Mr. Herbert Smith : We have to take your statement; but I want to say in passing that it is not satisfactory. It cannot be satisfactory. Even from your own figures supplied here we get a firm that lets 20,000,000 tons go
&quot;through its hands and in clerical work in transferring from the pit to the boat &apos;6d. a ton is taken  500,000 made out of transferring coal. It is simply absurd to look at any such price as 6d. a ton.The Chairman : I do not think that question arises upon this.Mr. Herbert Smith : It is all dealing with export. We want to know whether you will undertake this, and how you will indertake it; or shall we let everyone else live out of it ?The Chairman : I have said we will undertake to see what can be done, and do what can be done.Mr. W. P. Richardson : Have you any information with regard to the selling of coal by the colliery companies dirfe^t to householders, where they have created a department at their collieries for cutting out the middlemen 1The Chairman : No, I have no information at all.Mr. W. P. Richardson : Is it possible for them to be got and for us to be ^supplied with a copy of it ?The Chairman : I do not think it is information we could get.Mi-. W. P. Richardson : It has been published to have been a big saving to the colliery companies and to the buyers of coal.The Chairman : I do not think we have anything at all other than the Commission themselves got upon this matter.Mr. W. P. Richardson : Theirs was general, was it not ?The Chairman : They made some investigations privately without our heing party to them.Mr. W. P. Richardson : But these people who are doing this are members &apos;of your Association, and as this is an important factor and has been done by your members, by which there has been a mutual advantage, surely it is some-thing on which information might be conveyed to the other partner in the industry that is, the producers ?The Chairman : I do not think that is information we have any right toget.Mr. W. P. Richardson : I think you should.The Chairman : It is entirely outside the scope of our function. Now, ^the next paragraph : &quot; Local authorities should be empowered to engage in :the retail sale of coal.&quot; That is a matter which will require the sanction of Parliament before it can be done ; and, whatever may be our opinion as rate-vpayers, we do not propose to express, as colliery owners, any views upon it at all at present. I do not think it is a matter which really calls for any discussion between us and you at the present time. We have never refused to sell coal to anyone who will pay us our price for it. Local authorities are already very large buyers of coal for then&apos; own use. I do not think any of these could say &quot;they have had difficulty in getting coal from collieries if they wanted it.The next point is in regard to railway transport.Mr. Swan : Before you leave that other point. That is a question for legislation ; but due to your attitude with regard to not dealing with anything apart from producing coal, there is a possibility there due to your indifference all along, of coal being sold and giving a substantial return to the rates, and at 7the same time you would benefit, and the miner has the lowest possible wage and no hope for the future.The Chairman : Do you suggest that any profit which the local authorities might make on the sale of coal should be brought back to the collieries to help The wages 1
Mr. Swan : No. But due to your answer that you ignore the commercial side and only deal with production, that situation has been created.The Chairman&apos; : All I can say is that I do not agree with you.Mr. Swan : It is a fact ah the same.The Chairman : Now in regard to railway transport. We are in strong approval of any proposal for the increasing of the efficiency of the transport of coal; but of course the application of those proposals will have to he carefully considered. We do not at all object to the Standing Joint Committee which they suggest shall be set up. We should welcome any assistance we could get from the Government or any committee on it, or from anybody else to bring down the cost of the transport of coal. As we have said on previous oecasions,we should be very glad to accept your co-operation in any way you can give it to us in order to bring down the cost of carriage of coal on the railways.Mr. Herbert Smith : Is there not more in that than this, &quot; to secure the adoption of larger mineral wagons on the railways, and a greater concentration of ownership of wagons.&quot;   Is not that an important factor ?The Chairman : They say they propose measures to secure this. The measure is a Standing Joint Committee of the Ministry of Transport and the Mines Department ; and we say we raise no objection to the setting up of that Committee.We come now to the next question, No. 6, and we will take sub-paragraph (1) : &quot; The principle on which the recent wage agreements have been based is in our opinion sound, but amendments are needed in the method of ascertaining the proceeds of the industry for the fixing of wages.&quot; We are in agreement with their view that the principle of our recent wage agreements is sound.With regard to the next point, which deals with transfer prices, I think we stated our view pretty clearly before the Commission, and we are prepared to consider with you the devising of machinery for the settlement of transfer prices which will leave no possible ground for doubt as to their fairness. I do not think it would be profitable at the present moment for us to go into the details of how these transfer prices should be dealt with in the ascertainments when they are made ; but when we come to that point we shall be prepared to consider, in the light of the facts and having regard to the findings of the Commission as well, what method can be devised which will leave no cause for reasonable doubt that the transfer prices with which the colliery is credited will be absolutely fair ones.Mr. Da vies : They make a very definite statement as to how it should be done.   Are you accepting that ?The Chairman : That, I think, is a matter which you and we should consider, as to whether it is the best method that can be adopted. We are not going to express any opinion at the present moment as to that, and we do not ask you to express any opinion as to it at the present moment. But we are quite prepared to consider such means as we can devise between us for fixing these transfer prices on an absolutely fair basis .Mr. Davies : The Coal Commission are very explicit on that point, as to how the transfer prices should be declared, and declared publicly. You take that as one of their recommendations, I presume ?The Chairman : Is that the view you will press on us when we come to details on it ?Mr. Davies : We want to get your opinion on these matters, will come.   That is what our Chairman has said.Our time
The Chairman : i was content to leave it at that until you began to deal with the specific recommendation and asked us if we accepted it. I said we would consider with you the best means of carrying this out, and we shall not leave out of consideration the suggestion the Commission has made. I only asked in reply whether that was the view you were going to urge upon us. If it is so, we should know in time, so that we can form our opinion with reo-ard to it.Mr. Herbert Smith : You are aware we are able to take care of ourselves without being questioned like this. We are trying to get to know what you have to say ; because Lord Gainford has said, if he has said anything, if it is not fair, &quot; We want to do what is fair to the workmen.&quot; He said : &quot;We feel we are under an obligation.&quot; I suggest to you it is your obligation to put to us some recommendations how we are to be dealt with fairly, because we have not been dealt with fairly. These are your own figures. I am now speakino-a bit for myself. I do not know that I am particularly impressed with the soundness of the agreement we have ; I think there are too many loopholes in it with regard to capital cost, and so on.   Let me give you a case-The Chairman : I do not want to interrupt you, but those are details we shall have to go into later when we consider the machinery for the acsertain-ments.Mr. Herbert Smith : All of which is contingent On the paragraph we have named to you before.The Chairman : I do riot think that affects transfer prices at all. What-ever may be done by the Government or anyone else, it seems to me we have &quot;to try and come to an agreement on which the industry can be carried on ; and one of the points we shaU have to consider, when we deal with the National Agreement, is how these transfer prices should be fixed in order to do absolute justice as between us and you. I think you will find that I stated before the Commission it is reproduced in their evidence that the benefit of any doubt we would rather should be given in favour of the miners&apos; wages and not -against them.   We repeat that declaration.Mr. Herbert Smith : I am not saying you do not repeat it; but it has not worked out in actual fact.The Chairman : When we come to the working out of the actual problem, we shall have to sit down and consider it with more time at our disposal than we have got to-day.Mr. Davies : We do not want to persist, but the Commissioners are making certain definite recommendations on the question of ascertainments, about which you are now speaking. Can we get your opinion as to^where you stand in these matters ?The Chairman : I do not think you are fair, Mr. Davies, impressing us for an opinion upon some suggestion which the Commission has made when we are dealing with the general question of transfer prices in this way. We :say we are prepared to consider that or any other suggestion you may have. If that is the suggestion you are going to put forward, we will certainly consider it.Mr. Davies : How would you regard them as being real recommendations. That is the real dilemma which confronts us ?The Chairman : We on both sides ?Mr. Davies : Yes. Are we to regard these recommendations as being real recommendations when we come to tackle the problems which the Corn-mission has referred to from time to time.
The Chairman : We are dealing now with this specific paragraph, which says that amendments are needed in the method of ascertaining the proceeds of the industry.   We are prepared to consider with you what amendments arenecessary.Mr. Davies : I would hke to know whether you agree that the profits of mutual indemnity associations should be included ? They are concrete recommend ations.The Chairman : Is it wise to go on with questions of that kind ? We can consider the details of these if you wish to raise them when we come to thei question of Other Costs, or anything else in connection with the details of thei machinery necessary to carry out our agreement.Shall we now go on to sub-paragraph (2) :   &quot; The standard length of the&apos; working day, which is now on the average 7J hours underground, should remain unaltered. The optional re-distribution of hours within the present weekly total, over a week of five days instead of six, should be considered. The multiple shift system should be extended.&quot; Having obtained from you your definite declaration that you are not prepared to consider a return to the pre-1919 working hours, we on our side are quite prepared to consider with you greater flexibility, greater elasticity, on the lines that the Commission suggest, of the working hours in the collieries. It is obvious that any re-adjustment of this kind will require the sanction of Parliament. I think there is no doubt, as stated by the Prime Minister in those 14 points which were submitted to you, that whatever you and we agreed and submitted to the Government they will undertake to put to Parliament and carry into operation. We want to know from you whether you are prepared to consider increased flexibility and greater elasticity in the arrangement of the hours in the week.Mr. Frank Varley : We have hardly got used to that word &quot; flexi-bility &quot; yet.   It is a new one.The Chairman : There is a good deal that the Commission say upon it in another place, and I think we are entitled to ask you what is your attitude towards that question. I do not think at the moment we are prepared to enter into any argument with you as to the desirability or otherwise of it.Mr. Thomas Richards : We do not understand it.The Chairman : I am rather obliged to you, Mr. Richards, for that, because it may provide me with a way out sometimes. But this is really a matter on which we are entitled to ask you for a definite expression of opinion in just the same way as you are entitled to ask us for a definite expression of opinion on those other things.Mr. Frank Varley : Except that it says &quot; optional re-distribution.&quot; We recognise the option, and we have no wish to exercise it. That is the sum and substance of what Mr. Smith said this morning.The Chairman : The recommendation is that it should be considered. When you say you are not prepared to consider it, you are going directly in the face of this recommendation of the Commission. You are turning it down absolutely.Lord Gainford : May I refer to page 173 ? Mr. Varley says that &quot; flexibility &quot; is a new word. It is used by the Commissioners in this sense, when they say they cannot advise the State to go back to the pre-1919 position. They go on to say : &quot; In the first place, the inflexibility of the existing regulations sometimes causes a quite disproportionate loss of time and earnings.&quot;Mr. Frank Varley&apos; : Yes, I have seen it and recognised it; but Mr. Williams had given it to us about five times to-day.
The Chairman : The second paragraph also is of importance. But what i we want to know from you is whether you are prepared to sit down with us i and consider this question in the light of those two paragraphs on page 175  iMr. Herbert Smith : Our reply to that would be that we thought we i had made our statement perfectly clear this morning, that we did not intend 1 tampering with hours at all, and we think there is too much flexibility now It is the continual contention of a lot of us running up and down the districts finding breaches of the Seven Hours Act, reporting it to the Mines Inspector, then getting a letter from him saying it has been put right and it wiU not happen again, and no prosecution will be instituted this time. But if a work-man is seen by them violating an Act of Parliament, they would be the first chaps to suggest he should be prosecuted at once. If you let the schoolmaster go wrong the scholar will go wrong. I think the Miners&apos; Federation will not agree to any flexibility in regard to the miners&apos; seven-hours day to extend it.The Chairman :   Does that mean you are not prepared to consider it with us ?Mr. Herbert Smith : I do not say that; because you might put some proposition up to us which would demand a consideration, and we shotdd be foohsh to say &quot; No, no,&quot; without consideration. You might put up particular cases to us where you said, if so and so was met we should avoid so much difficulty we have to contend with ; then I think my Executive would say: &quot; We will consider this and see where it will take us to,&quot; and give you an answer to it.   We could not cut it out without any consideration.Mr. Thomas Bichards : You were quite wrong in treating my observation humorously, that we did not understand it. The Commission are not suggesting there should be any extension of hours, definitely. What they mean by greater flexibility, I do not really understand for the moment.The Chairman : To my mind I think they have made it clear. They have said that they do not recommend an increase of the hours for the week as a whole.Mr. Thomas Richards : That is right.The Chairman : But they do recommend that the weekly hours that are now permissible should be capable of distribution over the different days of the week in a manner less rigid than that which now applies, where you have a daily limit as well as a weekly limit.Mr. Thomas Richards :    Have you been able to see any practical apphcation of that one that can be considered between us at all ?The Chairman : I think when we come to consider it we should be able to suggest to you ways in which a very beneficial result might be brought about, both to you and to the working of the collieries in this respect.Mr. Frank Varley :  Did you not yourself combat Mr. Markham&apos;s idea of five days of eight hours producing more than five seven&apos;s and a five 1The Chairman : I do not want to enter into any argument about details at the moment, and I am not going to follow you in pressing for categorical replies to many phases of this in the way you have done with me in regard to the questions we have been discussing before. All I want to know is, whether you are prepared or not to sit down with us to consider what can be done within such limit of hours as we may find is possible, in order to f acilitate the working of the collieries.Mr. Thomas Richards : We cannot say &quot; no &quot; to that until we have seen your proposition.
The Chairman : You do not give us very much encouragement to feel that you are going to take it into serious consideration. If we do not, what Mr. Smith says stands, that you are not prepared to work more than the present number of hours per day, or anything of that kind, then it is not a fair reply to the question we put. If we are to accept from you the position no return to the former hours is capable even of consideration between us, we have to accept that situation. As I have said before, we cannot force you. But here is a concrete suggestion made by the Commission that within the limit of 42 hours in the six days it is possible to re-distribute those hours in a way which would give elasticity which would be beneficial to the working of the collieries  working more hours on one day and less on another, or any re-distribution of that land, which might be found to our mutual advantage.Mr. Frank Varley : I suppose we have got to discuss it. But when you say we do not give you any encouragement, we should be the veriest hypocrites if we did after what Mr. Smith said this morning, which does represent the view of the Federation.The Chairman : The view of the Federation in this respect you were turning down absolutely the recommendation of the Commission that you should consider it.Mr. Frank Varley : No.Mr. W. P. Richardson : Do we understand that you have put definitely now what you mean ?The Chairman : No, very indefinitely.Mr. W. P. Richardson : Do you think it is fair for us to commit ourselves until you do put it down ?The Chairman : I am asking you whether you are prepared to sit down with us and consider what ways we could adopt of re-distributing the hours or of giving greater flexibility within a certain limit of hours, than exists at the present time.Mr. Thomas Richards : Of course, subject to the reservation that we are not going to accept. Because when we say we will consider the thing, it does not necessarily commit us to find an arrangement under that committal.The Chairman : I do not know that I could at the moment press you on that, that you should tell us you are prepared to sit down fairly to consider this and with an open mind and without prejudging the situation, until we have had the position discussed between us.Mr. W. P. Richardson : I do not think you are entitled to infer that we will not give consideration to this.The Chairman : Very well.   I do not think we can carry that any further.Mr. Frank Varley : &quot; Flexibility &quot; is a word which allows of contraction as well as of expansion.The Chairman : If you have a certain limit within which you have to work any expansion in one direction means contraction in another direction, does not it ?Mr. Frank Varley : Yes ; but we have not accepted the limit even. There is nothing here about a limit.The Chairman : When we come to the details we shall find out about that.Now, the next point: &quot; The Multiple Shift System should be extended.&quot; Our view upon that I think, is sufficiently well known to you, and I should like to know what your attitude towards this question is.
Mr. Herbert Smith : Can you tell us where it has been practicable to i work shifts and you have been willing to pay for them, where people have I refused to work those shifts ?The Chairman : Yes I could, if I wanted to.Mr. Herbert Smith : I do not know a single case.   Where people object to pay for it of course we object to work shifts.The Chairman : I could give many instances, but all we are asked at the   I moment is to express our view on this recommendation, and our view is that   1 the multiple shift system should be extended where it is going to be a benefit. What is your view upon that ?   Do you say it should or should not ?Mr. herbert Smith : All I say is this, that when you people bring these concrete cases where you have suggested paying for it and it is practicable to work it, we shall consider them. But if it is out to force them on without payment we shall resist it.The chairman : That question does not exist.IMr. Herbert Smith : If you ask me to agree that multiple shifts should I go on without being paid for, I do not agree.The charman:   Whether it should be extended is the question.  The terms are outside our scope at the present moment.Mr. heebert Smith : If I saw and was satisfied that multiple shifts f were not going to be detrimental to the men and they would be paid for, work-ing two shifts instead of one, I should say at once we have to face that position, and I should advise the men to work it. That would be my reply to that. But if you said it was multiple shifts without pay I should say no, we shall stop at one shift.The Chairman : Is that the view of the Miners&apos; Federation as a whole ?Mr. W. P. richardson : I should like to draw attention to a misstatement in the Report which has a bearing on this ease. At the bottom of page 177 it says : &quot; Now that all districts are on the same footing in respect of hours so should they be in respect of the double shifts.&quot; I think your side as well as our side knows that is not correct. They have been basing the argument with regard to multiple shifts on the experience in Durham and Northumber-land. The hours are not the same, and that ought to be kept in mind. If you are prepared to put the hours on the same basis it might raise something for us to consider.The Chairman : I do not think they base their conclusions upon Northumberland and Durham in any way at all. I think South Yorkshire and other parts of the country-Mr. W. P. Richardson : No. They say: &quot; In Northumberland and Durham, double shifts were the accompaniment of the short hours enjoyed for more than a generation by the hewers, under collective agreement with the employers. In South Wales, the working hours were kept long, till Parliament intervened in 1908 ; double-shifting was hardly considered. Now that all districts are on the same footing in respect of hours, so should they be in respect of the double shifts.&quot; It is not a correct statement, and it is far from correct, too.A Representative oe the Mining Association :  Th t is not the only one.
The Chairman : They couple South Yorkshire with Northumberland and Durham in the paragraph ; but if we are going to question the recommendations of the Commission because there are statements in the text of the Report which we say are incorrect, I think we should probably find a great many jnore than you.Mr. W. P. Richardson : That does not answer the point I am putting. I think you are bound to have been informed that at least there is a substantial difference in the hewers&apos; hours, and it ought not to be used as an argument to put something on to someone else which has very much interfered with the social life of our people, on the grounds that they are working the same hours as the Northern people when they are not.The Chairman : &quot;We have not put that forward as an argument. None of us is responsible for what the Commission has said. All we are asked now is to say whether we accept, reject, or approve, or keep an open mind upon, this particular recommendation of the Commission ; and I take it that Mr. Smith has expressed his own personal opinion, which I did not gather to be that of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain as a whole, and if you are not in a position to give a reply to-day, then it is a point upon which a reply will have to be given if paragraph 1 on page 229 is to be complied with.Mr. Thomas Richards : Is not opinion on your side divided upon this question of the multiple shift as far as South Wales is concerned anyhow  and that was used by the Commission, the fact that it was one of the objects oi our rules to oppose double shifts as far as we could ?The Chairman : I think the Commission in effect condemned the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation for having such a rule.Mr. Thomas Richards : No, they do not do that.The Chairman : And they say the multiple shift rule where it is beneficial ought not to be met with opposition.Mr. Thomas Richards : Due to the economic situation, a large number of South Wales owners who wanted double shifts have been able to enforce them despite the rule of the Miners&apos; Federation ; and there are a large number of owners who really do not want it. When they cite Northumberland or Durham anyhow I do not suppose there would be very much opposition to it if they were given the six hours like they have in Durham.Mr. guthrie : There are no six hours in Durham.Mr. Thomas Richards : Durham hewers work six and three-quarter hours from bank to bank.Mr. Guthrie : Not to the hewers generally.Mr. W. P. richardson : The average hours are six and three-quarter hours, bank to bank.Mr. guhtrie : I thought Mr. Richards said six.Mr. Thomas Richards : It would be six in comparison with the way we read seven. When you take six and lihree-quarters, bank to bank, it is seven and three-quarters, bank to bank, with the others.The chairman : I do not think we can have an argument on this as to the hours worked in Northumberland. What the Commission have said is that the multiple shift system should be extended. They do not say it should be compulsory either generally or in a particular case. What I regard this to mean is that there should be no official opposition on the part of the Miners&apos; Federation or of the Mining Association to the principle of having double shifts where it is necessary.
Mr. Frank varley : You say you will not raise any opposition to this and we shall give you a reply to that in our categorical replies.The Chairman : Now No. 3 : &quot;Joint Pit Committees should be established generally.&quot; We have had this question under consideration jointly for some time, and, without going over the past in any way at all, I am authorised to say on behalf of the Mining Association that they are prepared to set up at the collieries throughout, by voluntary arrangements between the two parties Pit Committees to deal with such questions as can be properly dealt with by them ; and that we shall be prepared to sit down with you and agree nationally the lines upon which those Pit Committees should be set up ; and that we feel that if we can, voluntarily between the two sides, set up these Pit Committees in this way, there will be no necessity for any Parliamentary action or any legislation with regard to them. We accept the principle of Pit Committees to be set up voluntarily between the two sides.Mr. Herbert Smith : Does that mean you are not prepared to accept Part II of the 1920 Act ?The Chairman : We are not asked to accept that.Mr. herbert smith : Does that mean you are not prepared to do that ?The Chairman : We are not asked to accept that.Mr. Herbert Smith : Are you prepared to accept that?The chairman : I have indicated to you what we are prepared to accept that is, the setting up at every pit of a Pit Committee, and that the lines upon which those Pit Committees should be set up should be discussed and decided between you and us.Mr. herbert smith : I do not think, speaking from past experience, that voluntary committees fixed up between you and us are worth much. I have had some ; I want no more of them. I think it is provided for in the 1920 Act as explicitly as it could be. That is the Pit Committee we should countenance, and a Pit Committee which will tell us what the duties are in that Act of Parliament.The Chairman : We have never before been in a position to say to you on behalf of the industry that Pit Committees should be established generally. We say that to-day. We say that they should be and can be set up volun-voluntarily, and that the lines upon which they should be set up and their powers should be discussed and decided between you and us.Mr. davies : The Commissioners definitely recommend that Part II. of the Mining Industry Act should become operative.Several Eepresentatives of the Mining Association : No.Mr. Davies : It is at the bottom of page 213.The chairman : The Commission, I think, have definitely stated that if these things can be done voluntarily it is far better that they should be done voluntarily. I say again that we are prepared to set them up and to decide with you the functions of those Pit Committees to be applied all over the country.Mr. DAVIES : They have categorically, at the bottom of page 213, said : &quot; So far as this portion of Part II. of the Act of 1920 is concerned, we regret that it was never put into effect, and we recommend that steps should now be taken to revive it.&quot;The chairman : We are dealing here with their specific recommendation that Pit Committees should be established generally. We accept that in the proper spirit.   We say where it is a question of the participation of different
bodies for a common purpose it is far better wherever possible to leave the arrangement and the method to the voluntary action of the parties themselves, and we are prepared to sit down with you and try and lay down the lines upon which these Committees should be set up, and their functions.Mr. Thomas Eichaeds : But the difference is this. If this is put into operation as part of the Act of Parliament, it will not come up with all the other ingredients of our mysterious wage arrangements about every twelve months as we have been having lately, as one of the controversial points the thing will have been settled.The Chairman : You see, this is one of the steps that they contemplate under re-organisation of the industry, and it is one upon which we are prepared to co-operate with you. We see no reason why, by voluntary action on the part of both of us, we should not be able to get into operation these Pit Committees. I think you cannot but agree with us that if there is to be real co-operation, it must be co-operation in a spirit which can only be brought about by voluntary action, and that anything in the nature of compulsion is bound to detract from the success-of these Pit Committees; it is bound to introduce a spirit into them which would not be present if they were set up voluntarily ; and such good as they may do is bound to be far greater when they are set up in the true spirit of co-operation than they possibly could be by statutory obligation upon the people.Mr. Herbert Smith : I want to say that I hope I shall never stand on a platform and recommend the Miners&apos; Federation to accept voluntary Pit Committees as you suggest, because they will be a farce in their entirety. I ask you again . Are you prepared to accept Part II. of the 1920 Act ?The Chairman : We are not asked to accept Part II. of the 1920 Act; and I am perfectly certain that Pit Committees if set up compulsorily by Statute are bound to be a far greater farce, bound to be far less efficient, and to have far less influence, than if they are set up voluntarily with a spirit of co-operation between the two sides.Mr. Davies : The Commission was obviously of opinion that the Pit Committees must be established statutorily, because that is one of the 14 points.The chairman : I think if you and we represent to the Government that we have agreed to set up these Committees voluntarily and agree to define their functions and the lines upon which they should be set up together, Parliament would not dream of interfering. I am certain that the Government and the House of Commons would agree with us that if they can be set up voluntarily there should not be any interference by Parliament with regard to them.Mr. Frank hall : Is it not true that a large number of firms are not members of the Mining Association, and, if so, how could you impose it on them ?   Take Mr. Markham as a case in point.The chairman : I think your last question is a little bit of a poser: but I do not think it is a difficulty that could not be got over. That is what we have to say on that xooint.Mr. Herbert Smith : I am sorry, but that is disappointing. I only want to say that in passing, because it means a Committee without any functions at all.The Chairman : No ; it means a Committee with functions which are agreed between you and us.
Mr. Herbert Smith : We have had one and do not intend to have another.1 Mr. Davies : We had them when the war was on, and the general thin&quot; they created was an abnormal quantity of dissatisfaction and irritation. That is what they did.The Chairman : That is rather a bad testimonial for Pit Committees as a whole.Mr. Herbert Smith : No, it is not; it showed the voluntary powers. Mr. Davies : They have no power.The Chairman : I think we want to get through all these points before we separate. The next is : .&quot; The methods of payment of men not employed at the face should be revised where possible s,o as to give them a direct interest in output.&quot; We are in general agreement with that principle; but it is obvious that it is a principle which can only be worked out in detail at the pits. There is no possibility of laying down any general rule, even for a district, on a question of this kind; but we express our agreement with the principle.Then No. (5): &quot; The introduction of a family allowance system, either nationally or by districts, is desirable. Pooling schemes should be adopted to prevent married men with families being prejudiced in obtaining employment.&quot; This is a Question upon which you probably would have more to say than we. As far as we are concerned, we are not going to express any view adverse to the Commission^ recommendation ; but it is a question which I think obviously must be settled district by district as it arises in connection with the provision of a subsistence wage. All we can do nationally is to say that the principle of subsistence wage, which has formed part of our two previous Agreements should be continued, and that if the districts on the two sides could decide in favour of a system of family allowance it is perfectly open for them to do so. We are not adverse in any way to the Commission^ findings upon this point. In fact, some of us have expressed a strong opinion in favour of it.On the second sentence, about pooling schemes, our view there is, I think, that they are a complication which is not necessary.Mr. Prank Varley : Do you mean the pooling of the wage, or the pooling of the family ?The chairman : They have not defined exactly in this paragraph what they mean; but one can only imagine it is that the family allowance should come out of a general pool to which there should be contribution by everyone in order that there might not, as they seem inclined to fear, be a discrimina-tion against the married men. I think we are all agreed there never has been in the industry any discrimination against a married man. If anything, there has been a discrimination in favour of the married man, and we have had in every coalfield as long as the coalfields have been in existence this advantage, that the married man has got, and he geis, his house coal and, in some cases, his house, and there has never been&apos; any cause to suggest that because a married man has these advantges, which cost an appreciable sum of money in a year, a married man has found greater difficulty in getting employment than a single man. I think it is entirely the other way about, and, where these schemes are in operation on the Continent, in some cases they have no pool and their experience is that a married man has not suffered in respect of getting employment, or keeping his employment, through  the fact that he  gets
allowances which the single man does .not get. It is a question upon which you probably will have something to say. We express no opinion against this. We say, and I think you will agree, that it is a question which should be dealt with district by district.Mr. herbert smith : Do we understand that you lie dormant on this question; that you make no expression of opinion at all with regard to pooling?The chairman : We will consider the question of pooling when you say that you want family allowances.Mr. Herbert Smith : You made a statement which is not correct. Some districts have no perquisites at all, and parts of other districts do not.The chairman : I am speaking in a general sense.Mr. herbert smith : I think we have made too much of the houses and the free coal ; I am sick of hearing about it.   It is not correct.The Chairman : We shall be prepared to reconsider the whole of that position. That is our view in regard to this. It is for you to say what your view is. If you are not prepared to say it to-day it will do, no doubt, when wTe meet again.Mr. W. P. Richardson : Yes.The chairman: Now No. 6, &quot;Profit-sharing schemes, providing for the distribution to the workmen of shares in the undertakings, should be generally adopted in the industry, and should be made obligatory by statute.&quot;Mr. W. P. Richardson : Any back money ?The chairman : I think this is a question upon which we should like to have your view before we say very much about it. We adhere to the views we expressed in our evidence, that it is desirable to associate the workers as closely as possible with the success of the individual undertaking ; but we said there the way in which that could be done must be a question for the individual colliery. It is a point, perhaps, Mr. Smith, which you will take into consideration and let us know whether you want us to go into detail on it with you and see what can be arranged. But I do not want to lead you to think that the issue of bonus shares, or shares in the undertaking, is a scheme that can be generally applicable. The real principle, I think, lying at the base of it is the one we put forward as to the desirability of associating the individual worker with the success of his own individual pit, and with the result of his own work more closely than is possible under the present arrangement.Mr. Straker : Would they be the Ordinary or Preference shares ?The chairman: That is a detail upon which I am not in a position to express any opinion.Mr. Straker : I am asking this because one would give a share in the responsibility and management and the other would not. It is an important question, I think.The Chairman : It is a question which you will probably take into consideration before you express your views to us upon it.The next point is No. (7) : &apos;- For all new collieries, a proper provision of houses for the workers should be a condition of the lease.&quot; All that we can say upon that is that we are in favour of the provision of the best housing conditions that are practicable for all workmen.Mr. W. P. Richardson : What do you mean by &quot; practicable &quot; ?The Chairman : That depends upon the individual cases, surely, does it not?
Mr. W. P. Richardson : But had you something in your mind when you used the word ?The Chairman : I cannot say that I had anything so definite in my mind that I could express it to enlighten you upon the point.Mr. THOMAS Richards : I did make it a stunt a good many years ago to say that the time would come when anyone who was going to sink a pit would have to make the same provision for their workmen as for their horses when they erected stables it should be made compulsory that they should also erect houses.The CHAIRMAN : I am surprised you should suggest that the workmen should be treated like horses.Mr. THOMAS RICHARDS : Not the same accommodation, but aecommoda-tion in the sense that as they had to make a stable for the horse they should make a house for the workman.Mr. BAKER: I suppose it is fair to assume that these houses would have to satisfy the local public authorities.The Chairman : That applies to all houses. I do not think we are called upon to say any more than that we are in favour of the best housing accommodation that can be got that is practicable.Mr. .th0mas Richards : It will have to be got if it is made compulsory it should be provided at the same time as the colliery.Mr. W. P. Richardson : Will there be houses with baths in ?The Chairman : We come now to No. (8) ; &quot; The general establishment of pit-head baths is necessary. This should be undertaken by the existing Miners&apos; Welfare Fund, which should be increased by a substantial contribu-tion from royalties.&quot; We accept the Commission^ recommendation upon this. Are you in a position to indicate your view to-day ?Mr. Herbert Smith : No, I am afraid not.The CHAIRMAN : The next point is : &quot; When prosperity returns to the industry we consider that annual holidays with pay should be established.&quot;Mr. Thomas Richards : We propose the deletion of the first line.The CHAIRMAN : We say that when prosperity does return this is a matter which can then be considered, but that it should be left to be con-sidered until that time. .Mr. Thomas Richards : Are you optimistic now ?The CHAIRMAN : No, indeed I am not ; not in view of the decisions that we have heard from your side this morning.Mr. Herbert Smith : Can you tell us at all what is in your minds with regard to the wage question? You were telling us, to start with, about how you interpreted the findings of the Commission, on which we did not agree with you. Can you tell us what is in your minds as to, first, the men who are on subsistence wages which means an existence wage really if it is put into proper language and also what you suggest as to the method of fixing the minimum, what amount it will be in the future ?The Chairman : I do not think I have any difficulty at all in replying to those two questions now. In regard to subsistence wages, they have been decided in the districts and by the districts themselves with an independent Chairman in the past, and I do not think that we are desirous of suggesting any change in that procedure. We regard them as matters which must be dealt with in the districts : and, as I stated pretty clearly this morning, we

regard the question of the wages that are to be paid in the districts, including the minimum percentage for the district, as being matters which should be referred at once to the districts for their consideration. What may be the function of the National Board in regard to those district decisions afterwards is a matter upon which I indicated to you this morning what our view was -that we did not think it was possible for a National Board to exercise any veto over decisions in regard to wage rates which had been arrived at in the districts ; but there may be some reference generally to the National Board of the decisions which the districts had arrived at to give them their formal approval to see that they had complied with the national principles that were laid down, and to have them on record at the National Board. That is our view upon that point. We quite emphatically say that these questions of wage rates as well as of subsistence wages generally are questions which the districts only can deal with, and which the districts should proceed to deal with without any delay.Mr. Herbert Smith : Can I take it that you mean this really ; to sum it up: That your idea is that the districts should now go back and negotiate for a minimum which would be a reduction on the present minimum ; and that also with regard to subsistence allowances they should discuss those and reduce that minimum, and then go in for subsistence allowance on top of that ? Is that your idea ?The chairman : I do not think it would be consistent with what I have said before if I expressed any opinion as to the level all over of the minimum or the subsistence wage in the districts. I say they are matters entirely for the districts themselves to deal with.Mr. Herbert Smith : All I would like to say so that you will not misunderstand me is that at the present time, and this is until we take our further conference into consideration in the districts, we do not intend any \ surrender of the National Wage Agreement. That is the first thing. We do not intend any reduction, in wages ; and we do not intend any bartering with hours, unless with regard to hours you show us something that has some i difficulty affecting a certain stage of the employment that men could be safe-guarded against advantage being taken ; because you take more watching than i Scotland Yard takes if you get any advantage given at all.That is our position. So simply to say to us : &quot; Our intention is for you to go back to the districts and fix up district wages &quot; that is what your statement means &quot; and then come back here and say &apos; We have agreed to so-and-so, or we have not agreed &apos; we simply stand by and watch what happens in the districts &quot; we do not intend that. We want to be absolutely straight with you people. We want to act as a Federation. We want to safeguard you people from yourselves, cutting one another&apos;s throats like you have with regard to the subsidy ; you have lowered railway coal contracts over 45 per cent, since you got the subsidy. &apos; That is not foreign competition. Iron and steel does not drive the railway engines at all. You are saying to us as nicely as you possibly can : &apos;&apos; Go back to your various districts, submit to a reduction in wages, break up your national aspects &quot; all I want to say is that until we get another mandate from the Conference we have no such ideas as that.The chairman : I am not going to traverse your statements in any way at all; but I just want to put to you quite plainly what our view of the situation is. We think that we ought to sit down at once with you without any delay to thrash out the details of a National Agreement. We are not prepared to discuss or to entertain a national minimum. We accept the principle of a minimum in the same way that we accept the principle of a sub-sistenoe wage ; but we say that both the minimum and the subsistence wage
are equally questions to be dealt with in the districts, and that the districts should proceed at once to put their heads together in each district to consider the questions and to try and arrive at some conclusions in regard to them at a very early date. We are prepared in each district to meet you as soon as can be arranged. We are prepared to meet you here to discuss the national aspect of the situation and to try and draw up with you a National Agreement which will lay down national principles, which will lay down as far as we can see now the simplest way will be, a national ratio, and machinery on a national basis for carrying out the ascertainments of the wages and involve a consideration of all the details which we have considered in the past in that connection, but that the amount of the minimum and of the subsistence wage must be dealt with in the districts, and that such dealing with those two questions as may be left to the National Board afterwards, should not have the effect of exercising any veto or definite control of the amount of either the subsistence wage or the minimum that the districts may arrive at. I think it is as well to be perfectly plain and candid with you on the point, and I believe in that way we are going to the full length that we can be expected to go to in the light of all that has occurred, and having regard to the Report of the Commission in so far as it is necessary for us to have regard to it.- Mr. Herbert Smith: I do not object to you being plain. We shall probably be more plain than we are to-day when we have consulted our people-But if you are attempting to break up this Federation and leave each district to its own ability to defend itself you are making one of the biggest mistakes you have made in your lives. We shall defend our position at all costs as far as we are concerned, because the status of the mine-worker at the present time is below what it ought to be. He has been very submissive. He has been charged with crabbing this industry. I challenge any man to prove it. That has been denied, and it has been accepted by the Commission. On the other hand, we have charged you people with not doing what you ought to do. We are willing to do all we can to help this industry, but it is with this proviso, that when we have worked and given of our best, we are going to demand, as long as our voices will stand, a respectable wage for a respectable day&apos;s work  and that is not your intention.   You want to shunt us from district to district.The chairman: ff we had any desire or intention at all either to break up, or even to weaken the influence of the Miners&apos; Federation, we should not have been doing what we have done to-day sitting down with you to consider this question nationally aDd telling you what you probably did not expect to hear, that, notwithstanding&quot; what we said to the Commission, we are prepared to negotiate a National Agreement with you between the Miners&apos; Federation and the Mining Association.With regard to the other questions, we are as anxious as you are to provide for the Miners as high a wage as the industry can afford to pay. I do not think I should improve the position if I were to talk any further, or if I were to reply in detail to the last statement which you made.Now, is it still your wish that we should put into writing the proposals of our views on these questions as indicated to you this afternoon and let you have them to-morrow in time for us to meet and to give you any explanations or have any further discussion upon any of the points before we separate ? Because I take it that Friday being Good Friday, most of you will be wanting to get away from London, and that at to-morrow&apos;s meeting we can consider what our next procedure will be when we meet again and any other questions that may arise. I think we ought to be able to give you this statement in writing somewhere about 11 o&apos;clock. If you wanted any time to reacf it through before we met together we shall be here, and we could have our joint meeting at half past 11 and continue as long as was necessary.
Mr. Herbert Smith : I think we can accept that suggestion. Mr. Frank Varley : We should be very pleased to get the statements in writing; but is there now any necessity to have a meeting? Mr. Herbert Smith : I do not think so.Mr. Frank Varley : Whatever your statement has achieved we know where you are, I think.The Chairman : We are entirely in your hands.Mr. Frank Varley . We could let you know in five minutes time as to whether there is any necessity to come to-morrow.The Chairman : If we do not have a meeting to-morrow, are we to make any arrangements for future meetings ?Mr. Herbert Smith : I think after we have our Conference it would be wise to have a meeting and tell you where we stand then.I think we are bound to do that.If I have your position clear, that every district has got to go back and fix its own wage rate when I say that I mean percentages and that you contend that the National Board has nothing to do with it to ratify it or refuse to ratify it, all they have to do is simply to put their hall-mark on it and offer no opinion or anything else to do with it.The chairman I I do not think you could construe what I said to mean that the National Board could not express an opinion if it wanted to.Mr. Davies : But not an effective opinion.The chairman : Our view is strongly that the question of the minimum is one which affects each district itself, as the Commission has said ; and it is not as if one side could impose any minimum upon the other against its will. It is a matter that the two sides in the districts will have full liberty to deal with without any outside influence unless they choose on each side to have that outside influence. But when a district has arrived at a conclusion in regard to ft minimum to be paid in that district, then, as I have said before, we do not consider it at all practicable to have any interference with the district autonomy in that way.Mr. baker : In the event of a district not agreeing, what will happen then ?The Chairman : I suppose some way will have to be found out of the difficulty.Mr. Baker : We used to be there years ago. That is where you want to take us back again.Mr. herbert Smith : I think we had better meet in the morning. But I wonder whether you could let us have Your considered views before 11 o&apos;clock, because we do not want to walk in here and discuss them straight away.The chairman: I think you have a pretty acccurate knowledge of what our views are after this long day&apos;s sitting. But I think it is only fair to you that we should put them in writing so that you may have them in a more compact form than to have to go through the whole of the notes of this meeting to ascertain what they are. It is with that object that we suggest we should put them in writing, and it might be an advantage if we have mother meeting to-morrow, even if it is a short one, in order to see what views you might desire to express to us after a night&apos;s reflection, or after seeing in writing in a concrete form and in a more compact form what our views are.
Mr. Herbert Smith: What would be the earliest hour? Gould we have them before eleven o&apos;clock ?   It runs it rather late.The chairman : I do not know what the experience is on your side, but we find that when it comes to drafting any statement a small committee is far better than a large one, but the large committee wants to see what the small committee has done before it commits itself to it.What we propose to do is to prepare something for submission to our own people at ten o&apos;clock to-morrow morning, and to hand it to you as soon as we have gone through it. I do not think it will take us very long to approve of what has been drafted, and as soon as that is done if you come to this building we will hand it to you and we will give you such time as you want to go through it; then we can have a meeting either short or long as you please, to elucidate any points which have not been made clear.Mr. Thomas Richards : We had better make the meeting here at twelve o&apos;clock and not half past eleven.The Chairman :   Would you have your meeting here ?Mr. Thomas Richards :  This room is a bit too small.The chairman :   It would take some time to send them up to you.Sir Adam Nimmo : Are we right in assuming that at 11 o&apos;clock we shall have the reply of the Miners&apos; Federation on the various recommendations of the Report just as we have been making our reply to-day, and propose to put that reply in writing ? I was rather assuming that was the course you were going to follow.The chairman : If we are going to have a meeting to-morrow that point is one which we should have to deal with before we separated. I take it we shall meet to-morrow, so that we can have that point brought up and have your reply upon it. We want to say quite definitely that in our view we have no time to lose, and the sooner we get to grips with this question the better it is for&apos;the industry and for the country. If you will let us know in the morning whether you want to meet amongst yourselves, and whether you will meet at your own place and then come along here afterwards, we will act upon it ; but to save time, if that little room is insufficient for your purpose it might be advisable for you to come here at, say, 11 o&apos;clock, or at a quarter past 11, and then we can put the document into your hands for your consideration and meet here in this room as soon as you are ready.Mr. Herbert Smith : What was Sir Adam Nimmo&apos;s question ? I did not hear it.Sir ADAM NlMMO : Are we right in assuming that at an early date we shall have the definite reply of the Miners&apos; Federation to these various recommendations of the Report in the same sense as we have made reply to-day and propose to put that reply into writing ?Mr. herbert smith : You will have a reply as soon as ever we can consult our constituents, and we shall not delay. But we have not had the reply from you that we want that is, what is your idea as to the suggested alteration of the minima in your various districts, and what is your suggestion about those districts ? You are the people who are asking for an alteration, not us.The Chairman : That is hardly correct, Mr. Smith.Mr. Herbert Smith : If it is not correct, I suggest we adjourn this meeting for six months.
The Chairman : I think you must have understood from what I have said that this Committee cannot give any indication of any kind as to what the districts may decide upon in conjunction with the representatives of the miners in the districts as to these various matters. It is no part of the function of this Committee to indicate, or to interfere with the districts themselves in the determination of their minimum percentages or of their subsistence wages.   That is our view.Mr. Herbert Smith : You told us that twelve months ago. It fell on deaf ears then and it has fallen upon them again, because we have to act as a national body.Mr. Baker : Is it those districts, or some other districts you have in mind ?The Chairman : I have nothing in my mind in regard to them except this, that if there is any area which has been constituted in the past, and which desires to vary its constitution, it should at once declare its desire in that respect; because until those areas are defined it is difficult, indeed impossible, to get on with the work which we say should be done in the districts.Mr. W. P. Richardson : What is our arrangement for to-morrow ?Mr. Guthrie : Might I suggest it would save time if we handed the document to our friends here rather than send it up to Russell Square. I suggest if they are ready to meet at quarter past eleven we could hand the document to them and vacate this room while they are considering it.Mr. Thomas Richards : That is much the better plan.The Chairman : Very well; that did not occur to me.(Adjourned till To-morrow Morning).

(Secretary).The Chairman : Well, Mr. Smith, we carried out our promise to you yesterday, except in regard to time, and put in writing the proposals which we are authorised to make to you in regard to both the Report of the Commission and the terms on which the position should be settled up for the future.I do not want to take up any time at all in any further explanation or discussion upon them at the present moment ; but there is just one point to which I want to call your attention because there is a difference to some degree in the reply which we give you on page 5 in Recommendation 6, in the last sentence from that which was conveyed to you yesterday in the course of the discussion. It is to this effect, that we agree that the amounts of percentages settled in the various districts should be submitted to the National Conference for approval. We attach no kind of qualification to our acceptance of that item. That is all. I just wanted to call your attention to it because the Notes of yesterday might be considered by you to be in conflict in some way with our reply to-day, and it is in order to explain the point and bring it to your notice in that way that I mention it.Mr. Herbert Smith : Do we take it that all your discussion yesterday you withdraw and this takes the place of that ?   Is that it ?The Chairman : This puts exactly the position that we take up in regard to this matter.Mr. Herbert Smith : I mean, you only use the words &quot; of the Commission&quot; those are your additional words. These proposals should be submitted to the National Conference for approval I take it submitted for approval or rejection
The Chairman : When they are submitted to the National Conference for approval it will be for the National Conference then to decide what it does with them.Mr. Baker : Either approve or otherwise ?The Chairman : Exactly.Mr. Herbert Smith : I think we are able to read these Notes intelligently as to what you mean. There will be no confusion in our explaining them. I think you have put quite clearly what you put to us yesterday ; but there are two or three things we ought to get to know from you people before we part; because we are going to meet a Conference of our own coalfields. We have kept from committing anyone to any policy until that Conference takes place and until it has consulted the districts ; so we want to be as clear on this as we possibly can.Before the Prime Minister with you and your co-officials, I and my co-officials asked the Prime Minister as to what would be the position after the 30th April; were the Government to stand on one side and leave it to the two parties to battle it out. We should like to ask you now, seeing that you gave no opinion then, what you have in your minds when ycu tala. about going back to tho districts to fix up the minima. If ycu are prepared, to express what you think those minima will be. What have you in your minds at the present time as to what policy you are going to adopt, or will you adopt it jointly with us to see the Government as to what extent they are prepared to help the industry ?I know you have expressed your opinion as a national body against a subsidy. I know that quite well. I also know that experience has taught some of you people rather a different lesson from that which you learnt last July. You have also trafficked in this business. I said yesterday it waa 45 per cent. as a matter of fact it is 47 per cent. less in regard to contract prices for railways now than it was before the subsidy. You people have brought that about not by German or French competition but by your own competition here, and you have reduced these prices while we are in a chaotic condition in practically every district. We want to know whether you are prepared to join us in approaching the Government jointly to see what the Government is prepared to do to deal with any lowering of the standard of the Miners&apos; wages.The Chairman : We expressed our opinion very definitely before the Commission in regard to the subsidy, and the Commission have stated quite as clearly what their view is in regard to it ; and the Government have said to us that they adopt the view expressed by the Commission ; and we stand exactly where we did in regard to that matter. But we think that it rests with you and us to take the most speedy steps possible to get down to grips with this position and to tackle the realities of it, and to try to come to a settlement before the end of this month. We do not think there is any time to lose ; and we would urge that you should get yourselves into a position to give us the same definite replies upon the points that arise as we have given you to-day.Mr. Herbert Smith : So that the position you take up is this correct me if I am wrong that until we see how submissive your people are going to be, we are going to make this a bargaining point and do nothing until then.The Chairman : No. I am not suggesting in the very least that our attitude towards the subsidy will be changed at all. We have the declaration of the Prime Minister that if a settlement is arrived at there will be certain districts where the reductions in wages will be heavy, and that the Government
will consider coming to the assistance of those districts in some form or other We shall raise no objection to that at all, we shall do nothing which will prevent the Government helping down the industry in the way that the Prime Minister suggested it was possible they might do.Mr. Herbert Smith : Do we understand that the position you take up is simply that of spectators, watching how the game goes and seeing whether you have had your money&apos;s worth or not.   Is that what you mean again ?The Chairman : No, we do not intend to play the part of spectators at all. We shall have to take as active a part as you in coming to terms between ourselves ; because at some time or other, whatever may happen in the mean-time, we have to come to terms between ourselves to carry on the industry ; and what the Government may do in regard to it is not in our opinion anything to help us, it is to help the wages of the men for such period as they might determine it is advisable for them to do.Mr. Herbert Smith : But you are not going to put that as a general statement, are you, that it is not for them to help us ? You have been participating, and I submit some of you much better than you ought to have participated, in comparison with the workmen during this subvention.The Chairman&quot; : I do not want to enter into an argument at the moment, because it will serve no purpose, as to the effect of the subvention; but it clearly is given by the Government to make up the difference between what the owners are called upon to pay and what the men actually get. I do not think we could usefully spend any time in discussing that question at the moment as to what the effect of the subvention has been.But in regard to the future, I think I have stated quite definitely what our view is. We are strongly opposed in principle to the industry being carried on by a subsidy from the State. We think that unless it can be got into a position to stand on its own footing like the other industries of the country, it will not be to the good of the industry or to the good of the country. But in regard to such temporary assistance as the Prime Minister adumbrated we shall not do anything which will be to the prejudice of the men in that respect.Mr. Herbert Smith : I think when you have told us that which has not much in it as far as we are concerned you ought to tell us what you really have in your minds as to what is likely to be the reduction in the various districts.The Chairman : We have nothing in our minds. We have not considered the question. As I stated to you yesterday, as clearly and as frankly and as definitely as possible, those are questions which we do not take into con-sideration here ; they are questions for the districts themselves to deal with.Mr. Herbert Smith : I put it to you that they are questions for this body; and if I read page 228 I am right about it, too. In regard to the minimum percentage I think it is a question for the National Board to discuss, and I think it is also a question for you to say whether you approve of Clause 4 on page 228 which says : &quot; Recoupment to employers of any expenditure incurred by them in paying wages at the new rrrinimum rather than on the basis of the ascertainment should be postponed till wages shall have risen again, in accordance with the ascertainment, at least to the minimum now ruling under the 1924 agreement.&quot;The Chairman : We think it will be time enough to consider the question of recoupment when we have got a great many other things out of the way and settled.
Mr. Herbert Smith : We do not agree with you. If that is your answer, of course we have to take it. But we want to know where we are jumping to. We want to know how this thing will affect us and whether it is possible or not to get over this. You have in your minds some statements ; but if you have not, next week we shall make some statements as to what it does mean as we understand it. For us to start and make statements that are not correct would be wrong and not good for either party. But we shall give them to the best of our ability. H you could have given us a general opinion as to what would happen in the various areas not strictly correct but an estimate we should have had something to guide us.The Chairman : I do not think there is any necessity at all for you to rely upon estimates or anything else. We suggest, in fact we urge and press very strongly, that you should get into touch in the districts so that you may get a definite figure from the owners in each district as to what they think the minimum should be in that district.Mr. Frank Varley : It is not right to say you had no idea, because a few moments ago you used the Prime Ministers phrase, when you said the Prime Minister was prepared to give temporary assistance for the purpose of helping down-those were your words.The Chairman : Those are the Prime Ministers words, I think.Mr. Frank Varley : Are they ?The Chairman : Yes.Mr. Frank Varley : I had not appreciated them if they were.The Chairman : No, Mr. Smith, I think the position is quite clear in that way, that we cannot even give you an idea because, as a Central Committee, we have no power or authority, nor do we think it is competent for us to deal with any questions of the kind that you indicate. Subsistence wages and the minimum percentages are questions which the districts should deal with straight away. In the words of this paragraph of the framed report, when they have got themselves into a position in which they have something definite to send up to the National Board, well then, they will do so.Mr. Herbert Smith : Of course we have to take your answer, Mr. Chair-man.   I am not going to commit-The Chairman : I want there to be no doubt in your minds.Mr. Herbert Smith : I think you had better let me finish. I do not want to commit this side of the Board at all; but unless we get some lead from you people as to what is likely to be in your minds as to the reduction of your minima, we have to stand to it nationally until we know where we are going to get to.Mr. Cook : They have the district audits. You have them nationally ; and you certainly can say what is in your minds if your statement even here means anything. You can know nationally. You do know what reductions you intend to apply.The Chairman : Mr. Cook, I have said quite definitely we do not know. We have not considered the question. We have not even talked about it. They are questions which the districts, and the districts only, in our view, can approach ; and you need have no necessity at all to make guesses or estimates. You can, if you get into consultation and discussion with the owners in the districts, get from them definite figures, when you have discussed and explored the situation, as to what they would propose in each district as the minimum percentage which the district will stand. Beyond that, I do not want you to have any doubt in your minds as to what we do mean.   I cannot discuss the
question of the district, minimum rates at this Committee at all; and in our opinion they are not matters which should come to the National body until the districts have dealt with them and are in a position to submit something concrete to the National Board, as the Commission said.Mr. Cook : You said yesterday the wages in the district should be based on the economic ability of the district to pay. I think you used those words yesterday.The Chairman : I used a lot of words yesterday I am afraid during the five hours or so that you kept me talking. But I am not going to be drawn into any discussion as to what may happen in the districts.Mr. Cook : That statement was made, and that has a meaning..The ChAiRMAN : i try to use words in order to convey meaning as a rule ; perhaps I do not often succeed. But whatever I did say yesterday subject to any corrections in the notes that may be necessary I stand to it, with tho one exception that I indicated to you in the beginning with regard to the qualifiea-tion of approval by the National Board.Mr Herbert Smith : I do not understand your position of saying you are not going to be drawn. I want to put it to you that if we are open and above board it is not a question of being drawn ; it is a question of telling people what really is. You have already set to work, and you will get stopped at it take my tip to ask people to meet you to discuss certain things as to District areas. There will be no certain areas until our Conference has decided what its policy is. So you need not try to wheedle us into a position ; it is not fair to attempt it. We told you yesterday we were calling a conference, and we will put that before the Conference. It is not for you to say you want to put on the Agenda discussion at the districts as per so-and-so.   We are not going to do it.The Chairman : There is no question at all of wheedling. We have taken the Commission^ recommendation and in effect we have accepted it. What I meant by being drawn into a discussion was not what you seem to imply, but that I was not going to discuss a matter which I was not empowered to discuss and of which I had no knowledge.Mr. Thomas Richards : No, but you must appreciate, Mr. Evan Williams, if I may say it as mildly and as inoffensively as I possibly can, that this clocu-ment cuts no ice for us at all. When we go to our men we have got to go to them on the question of what alteration is going to be attempted in our wages. That is what the workmen are after not all this, if I may say so, highly ingenious document ; exceptionally ingenious.The Chairman : You are very complimentary.Mr. Thomas Richards : Of course we shall have to examine it carefully, and, depend upon it, we shall find out where the ingenuity is displayed. For example, your last attempt : The Chairman : Could not we be content with the compliment at the moment.Mr. Thomas Richards : No. I only want to give you just an example. The Commission says that the reasonable course of the National Conference is to refer the question of minimum percentage and such other matters as they have provided, to the district associations to frame proposals ; those proposals to be subject to the National Conference for approval. Here is the ingenuity You come to us this morning and tell us : &quot; We have now decided we will accept the full decision, or recommendation, of the Commission, and we will have the matter of the minima submitted to the National Conference.&quot; But you do not submit it as the Commission say it should be submitted that
proposals in the various districts should be submitted to the National Conference for approval ; but you say : &quot; They (the Owners) are prepared to agree that the amounts of the minimum percentages settled in the various districts should be submitted to the National Conference for approval.&quot; That kind of ingenuity does not cut any ice.The Chairman : It is not a question of ingenuity at all.Mr. Thomas Richards : That example is to be found all through this document, and you cannot settle like that.The Chairman : It is not a question of ingenuity at all. It is as clear a definition as we could set down in words of our position in regard to these recommendations.Mr. Thomas Richards : It is an attempt to appear as if you were accepting the Commission^ Report but you are not.The Chairman : It is not intended to mislead you in any way but to put to you plainly the position we take up.Mr. Thomas Richards : Tell us now-The Chairman : I have said clearly this morning already that in our view the question of the minimum rates must be dealt with in the districts, and it is no good coming for information upon this to a body which has not got it.Mr. Thomas Richards : I was not complaining about that. But why attempt to put in here something and assume to be accepting the Commission^ form of doing this when it is an entirely different matter ? Why not say that you could not accept the commission^ form ?The Chairman : I think the ingenuity is more on your part in trying to read into what we have said something which is not there.Mr. Thomas Richards :   Really, no.   The Commission says-The Chairman : You see, you could very well take that line and challenge our statements as being acceptances or otherwise of the Commission^ recommendations, if you were in a similar position and were accepting on your part all the Commission^ recommendations. We have endeavoured to define our attitude towards these recommendations and to put in language which we have tried to make as unmistakable as possible what our view is. Whether they agree with your interpretation of the Commission^ recommendations or not, quite frankly, did not concern us at the moment when we were drawing this up.Mr. Thomas Richards : Surely submitting proposals for approval is an entirely different matter from submitting an agreement for approval, is it not ? May I put a further question ? Is this submission for approval to the National Board intended to be subject to the other arrangements under the National Board in case of disagreement to go to the Independent Chairman ?The Chairman : You see, in the past there were certain questions laid down in the Agreement itself that were to be decided by the Independent Chairman in case of failure to agree. In all other respects matters could only he referred to the independent Chairman by agreement between the two parties to refer them.Mr. Thomas Richards :   That is the relation in which this will stand ?The Chairman : It clearly is not in our minds that the reference to the National Board for approval of proposals which come up from the districts should be matters for the Independent Chairman to decide at all.
Mr. Frank Varley : Can you apply this simple test then. Do you? think it could ever possibly work ? Can you conceive a situation in which a district, haying agreed that it would forfeit its rights, would allow the National Board to deal with the matter ; do you think that your side of the National Board would wish to interfere and would agree to a reference to the National Independent Chairman ?   Is it intended that it should work ?The Chalrman : I think you are using words similar to those I used1 yesterday.Mr. Frank Varley : What is the virtue in. saying you refused it yesterday and now you accept it; in the sure and certain knowledge that it is no good ?The Chairman : We said yesterday that we would agree to a reference to ensure that national principles had not been infringed. We qualified our acceptance of reference to the National Board yesterday, and we now make the reference to the National Board for approval unqualified.Mr. Frank Varley : But you say that the quantum forms no part of the national principle.The Chairman : We say the quantum forms no part of the national-principle.Mr. Frank Varley : Very well. Then what is the good of ever referring it here ?The Chairman : I can ask the same question.Mr. Herbert Smith : If your interpretation is correct, why are these words on page 14.9 : &quot; Because the Forest of Dean cannot guarantee a standard of living absolutely up to the minimum thought necessary in Yorkshire, it does not follow that mining in the Forest of Dean should cease to exist. It is, however, essential, as we point out below, to secure, either by national negotia-tion or national approval of district negotiations, that various district minima do not diverge too widely, and that there is no possibility of that cut-throat, competition at the expense of wages which the Miners&apos; Federation fear ? &quot; I suggest to you that all lends itself to national. Our point is first to fix, even if we agreed to go to the districts afterwards, the policy on which the national wage should be discussed.The Chairman : Unfortunately, in the body of the Report there are many passages which can contradict other passages ; and we have a definite recommendation which they put forward in that particular respect, which we-have dealt with in the best way we could.Mr. Straker : But what is meant by &quot; district associations &quot; ? It has-been suggested that in a district there might be a difference between the representatives of the owners and the representatives of the men as to what the subsistence wage should be. You suggest in that case it would go to the Independent Chairman that is, if that machinery were renewed or resurrected again, that would be so.The Chairman : That would be so.Mr. Straker : But I am not sure that that is contemplated by the Commission when they make this statement. Is it not meant that proposals shall come from both sides, if they fail to agree, and the National Board shall then consider the question and finally decide ?The Chairman : I do not think there is any recommendation that the National Board should decide between two conflicting proposals from the districts in any part of this Report.
Mr. Cook : Then there is no good to bring it here at all. . The National Board will not function.Mr. Straker : If the question of a dispute of that kind goes to a District Chairman or Umpire for decision, and he decides, can you imagine any value whatever in sending it on to the National Board ? I cannot imagine that even the Independent Chairman of the National Board would take it upon himself to alter the decision of the Local Umpire.The &quot;Chairman : I think we are discussing this question of the form of approval of the National Board rather prematurely. I do not think we can do anything at the moment except take the Commission&apos;^ recommendation that the district associations should meet and consider the questions of minimum percentages and subsistence wages or any other matters which they think are relevant in these districts, and try to come to a settlement.Mr. Thomas Richards : That is, you are prepared to accept part of the recommendation, but not the whole %The Chairman : No ; we do not say that at all.Mr. Thomas Richards.: Let me say that you do.The Chairman : I do not think you are in a position to challenge the form of our acceptance of any part of this Report until you tell us what your attitude towards the Report is.Mr. Thomas Richards : It is you who are seeking the changes ; it is not we who are seeking them.The Chairman : On the contrary, Mr. Richards, we are not. The position we are in at the present moment is that we are paying wages based upon a certain form of ascertainment.Mr. Thomas Richards :  Then you are seeking to change that.The Chairman : Well-Mr. Thomas Richards : There is no doubt about that. I think I am justified in saying that you are accepting part of the Commission&apos;s Report on that subject; because what the Commission has said is that proposals shall be made in the districts and shall be submitted for approval to the National Board ; whereas you are not accepting that; you said if the districts are able to agree, then those agreements will come for approval. That is an entirely different matter.The Chairman : I do not agree with you at all. But I think the time will come when you will be in a similar position to us to discuss the form of acceptance of any recommendations, when you are in the same position as we are in to-day.Mr. Thomas Richards : We want to know, of course, what form The Chairman : I think I have said we accept that recommendation of the Commission.Mr. Cook : With your interpretation.The Chairman : And we indicate to you the way in which we interpret that recommendation and the way in which we accept it. I do not think I can say any more. We have not tried to mislead you or to use words that are ambiguous. There is no equivocation of any kind in the form of our acceptance of that recommendation.Mr. Frank Varley : Except that here and there you say you accept, and then you put your own interpretation upon the acceptance. The man in the street, everybody, believed, I think, that the National Board, if it was to
have any functions at all, those functions would be in the nature of a Court of Appeal.   Now you circumscribe its functions to be purely benedictory.The Chairman : The view of the man in the street I do not think need influence it at the present moment. We place a certain interpretation upon that recommendation, and we accept it in the light of that interpretation. You may place another interpretation upon it; but you cannot force upon us your interpretation any more than we can force upon you our interpretation.Mr. Straker : Why I raised the question really was to get to understand your interpretation. Having understood it, we have to accept it that is as far as it goes.   We wdl give our own afterwards.Mr. Herbert Smith : I think that we have understood particularly clearly is this, that you people are after a reduction in wages. There is no doubt about&quot; that. It is perfectly clear. You say : &quot; We are not prepared to tell you the amount; we are prepared to ignore page 149 entirely.&quot; That is what you are doing.The Chairman : You must not put words into my mouth.Mr. Herbert Smith : I am putting words out of my mouth, and I want you to listen as quietly to me as I listened to you when you made your statement. Because you have said when you are in equally as good a position as us, so and so. We are due for some alteration ; we are due for more wages than we are getting. But you people have brought this about, and it is you people who are trying to build up this industry at the expense of the workman, and tho workman to get nothing out of it.   That is simply what your dictum means.The Chairman : I do not accept your interpretation of my words ; and I do not accept words put by you to me which I have not used. The position is perfectly clear to our minds that there can be no procedure which will lead us any further but the reference at once to the districts of the consideration of this question of the amount of wages wdiich they can pay in those districts.Mr. Cook : It means, in other words, that the districts should decide the amount of the reductions.The Chairman : Exactly.Mr. Erank Varley : But we thought we were negotiating that is an ultimatum.The Chairman : As far as the procedure is concerned, we say quite definitely we are not prepared to discuss here in London the wages which are to be paid in Scotland, in Northumberland, in Durham, in Yorkshire, in South Wales, or in any of the other districts of the country.Mr. W. P. Richardson : You are doing that, because, if you had to tell us to-day what the districts had to suffer by way of reduction, it would put the public up against you in the demand you are putting forward. You are playing for safety, because you cannot discuss district wages. Every one of you here is as fully competent to discuss it, with the data at your disposal, as any of the districts. But by doing that you would have to reveal what the effect would be on the men&apos;s wages, and because that revelation would come as a shock you want to play the safety game.The Chairman : I deny that, and I will content myself with saying that.&apos; &apos;&quot;&quot; ..............      . .. y.  &quot;i ... . .. . I.  jMr. Cook : You leave it to us to work out, as we can work it out, on the basis of your statement either at the Commission or by the returns for January and February, what reductions you intend. We have done that, and we challenge you to deny them.  . ...
The Chairman : Is it not rather ridiculous to work out something for yourselves without any data of any kind at all, when&apos; you can get ;by discussion in the districts definite proposals after discussion ?Mr. Cook : But the data is there. If the statement you made yesterday means anything, we have the data. The only question is working out the minima and the subsistence wages on the returns and revenue that come into the industry. -       .      &apos;;The Chairman : We have never suggested the method by which the district would arrive at the amount of minimum which they think they can pay.Mr. Frank Varley : But you do agree in one part of your proposals with the statement of the Commission that the present method of wage ascertainment has good principles within it.   You accede to that ?The Chairman : Yes.Mr. Frank Varley : We assume there will be a continuation of that. Therefore, that is the formula. The formula applied to the facts gives certain results.   It surely is not guesswork.Mr. Cook : Hear, hear.The Chairman : Well, those are questions for the districts themselves as to what sacrifices the owners are prepared to make, and what sacrifices the men are prepared to make, and the Commission contemplate, when they talk of sacrifice, not sacrifice on one side only, but sacrifice on both sides, and they say so definitely. They say quite definitely (and there is nothing in this report which is doubtful at all on the point) that they fully confirm the opinion that reductions of wages must be made.Mr. Cook : One other question. You say on page 10 of this document with regard to hours, &quot; While remaining convinced that a return to longer working hours is imperative to restore prosperity to the industry, in face of the emphatic declaration of the miners&apos; representatives that they wdll not entertain any suggestion in this direction, the owners are anxious to consider with the miners the recommendations of the Commission that the definition of working time should be by the week instead of by the day, and that greater flexibility may be provided in the working hours.&quot; Can you interpret what you mean by that ?   Do you mean a five day week ?The Chairman : I think we discussed that matter yesterday just after you had gone.   You will find a good deal on the notes about it.Mr. Herbert Smith : I do not see that there is any need to prolong this meeting further ; because you people are not prepared to give us the evidence that we are seeking, and, of course, we must take our own steps to consult our own districts in our own way and give them the information we have, and let them see the position really as far as we possibly can.The Chairman : All we would ask, Mr. Smith, is that you should put yourselves in the same position as we are in to-day as quickly as ever possible ; because we are quite as concerned as you are as to the position at the end of April. The time is a short one, and it is imperative to our minds that we should get to grips with this question as soon as ever possible : and in any figures that you may put to your own people I feel quite sure that you will not say that they are based upon anything that the owners have told you or mdicated.Mr. Cook : On this question of hours. Near the beginning you say that the miners&apos; representatives will not entertain any suggestion. I understand that our Chairman very clearly pointed out yesterday that there is the same
determination over any flexibility over the arrangements during the week by less days as there is over the lengthening of hours on one day alone. That was made clear.The Chairman : It is all on the notes.Well, Mr. Smith, I take it that we can expect from you at an early date replies on the position in a form similar to that which we have given you a form which will define exactly your attitude towards these matters ; and that until we get from you something as definite as we have given to you and as authorised by your people, I take it, as this is authorised by ourselves, there is little we can do.Mr. Herbert Smith : I do not think it will take much to comply with your request. But as to definiteness, we will try and put it more definite than you have. This is the most indefinite statement I have ever seen put together. We shall be able to tell you Yes or No when you ask a question as to what is put down on paper. As to speed, leave us to manage our own business as speedily as we can. Ours is a bigger organisation than yours, in numbers if not in area, and we have to consult our people. It will not be the decision of the Miners&apos; Federation, but the decision of the coalfields.The Chairman : That, of course, is a matter which rests entirely with you. All I wanted to urge was the vital importance of our losing no time on both sides. So then we can leave any question of a future meeting until you are in a position to tell us that you can put something definite before us from your side, and you will do that as soon as you can mr. Herbert Smith : Yes, as speedily as we possibly can.
93615APPENDIX.Statement of the proposals of the Coal Owners on the Report of the Royal Commission, communicated by the Mining Association to the Miners&apos; Federation at meetings held on Wednesday and Thursday, the 31st March and 1st April, 1926.The Owners have carefully considered the Report of the Royal Commission, and while they cannot but regret that on a number of points the Commission have not seen their way to agree with the views expressed by them, they have been influenced in coming to their conclusions on the Report by the urgent necessity of arriving at a peaceful solution of the problem of the coal industry on a basis which will enable Owners and workmen to co-operate in an effort to-secure the best possible results for all parties concerned.The Owners have further been influenced by the fact that the Government have declared themselves prepared to adopt measures which are distasteful to them in an endeavour to secure a settlement by agreement on the lines of the Report of the Royal Commission.So far as the recommendations of the Commission which call for action by the Government are concerned, the Government have intimated that if an agreement is reached between the parties on the lines of the Report by the 30th April, they will take the necessary legislative or administrative action to give-effect to them.While, therefore, the Owners, like the Government, regard some of these measures as unsound in principle, they take note of the Government statement, and will conform to such measures as Parliament may enact.So far as the recommendations of the Commission which call for action by the Owners are concerned, the following statement of their attitude in regard to the various recommendations will show, that whatever may be their views, on a number of expressions of opinion in the Report they have approached the matter with open minds, and that it is their sincere desire to do their utmost to give effect to the objects aimed at in the recommendations, if a. settlement by agreement can thereby be effected.RECOMMENDATIONS  ON  PAGES  229-235  OF  THE  REPORT  ON THE ROYAL COMMISSION.Recommendation . 1. Before any sacrifices are asked from those engaged in the industry, it shall be definitely agreed bteween them that all practicable means for improving its organisation and in-creasing its efficiency should be adopted, as speedily as the circum-stances in each case allow. The measures to these ends which we con-sider practicable are stated in the preceding chapters of this report, and will be summarised in the chapter that follows.Ownees&apos; Reply. The owners for their part are prepared to do everything in their power to improve the organisation and increase the efficiency of the industry. The action which they propose in regard to the various measures which the Commission suggest for their attention is indicated, below.
The owners agree not to counten-ance such general accusations.The owners agree that the Report of the Commission fairly states the case on this subject.Although the owners strongly pressed upon the Commission as a point of fundamental importance their view that it was in the best interests of the industry that negotiations should in future be conducted on a purely district basis, they agree to accept this recommendation.The owners agree not to make such charges.2. The owners should discontinue charging the miners as a body with deliberate attempts to destroy the prosperity of the industry, in order to compel its nationalisation. It is pos-sible that there may be a small number of individuals here and there who are animated by this idea, but we are con-vinced that the point is without sub-stance.3. The owners should also cease to countenance accusations against the miners of restriction of out-put.. Here again there may be sporadic cases, and when the rates of pay for new classes of work are under discussion production may sometimes be purposely kept at a low level. But viewing the effect upon the industry as a whole, this point is quite mi-important.4-- The miners, on their part, should cease to attach exaggerated weight to losses of output due to failures of the management to provide the colliers with proper supplies of tubs, rails, timber, or other requisites. Such cases undoubtedly occur from time to time, and a proportion of them are due toinefhcient management. In particular places, and on particular occasions, an appreciable loss may be caused, both to the colliery and to the workmen. But the effect upon out-put in general, and upon wages, is very small.5. The mine-owners should not re-fuse to engage in discussions on a national footing with the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain. All the principal industries of the country conduct negotiations bteween em-ployers and employed on a national basis, and we can see no reason why the mining industry should be an ex-ception atthesame time, the conditions imperatively require that there should be a large degree of flexibility in the wage rates of the different districts. The Miners&apos; Federation should recog-nise this, without detriment to the broad policy that the general principles should be laid down nationally.
7. Ownership oe the Mineral.  The error which was made in times past, in allowing the ownership of the coal to fall into private hands, should be retrieved. The mineral should be acquired by the State by purchase where it has a market value, by declaration of State ownership in the case of unproved coal or coal at deep levels, which has now no market value. The coal of existing mines which are likely soon to cease working, and coal which is not now worked and is not likely to be developed in the future, should be excluded from the purchase. Safeguards should be adopted against excessive compensa-tion claims. A Coal Commission should be appointed under the authority of the Secretary for Mines to acquire and administer the mineral property.8. Amalgamations oe Existing Mines. The amalgamation of many of the present small units of pro-duction is both desirable and practicable.   This   may   often   beIn deference to the Commission^ view the owners have accordingly abeady invited the Miners&apos; represen-tatives to meet them nationally with a view to the formulation of a national wages agreement. They propose that the two sides should proceed at once to consider the general principles to be incorporated in the agreement which would include the ratio between profits and wages, the details of the method of ascer-tainment and the definition of proceeds and of the items of costs of production. They further accept the principle of a minimum per-centage on basis rates in each district, and propose that the amount of this percentage and also (as hitherto) the amount of subsistence wages for the lower paid men should bereferred tothe district associations. They are prepared to agree that the amounts of the minimum percentages settled in the various districts should be submitted to the national conference for approval.Though the owners have expressed their view that this proposal will not help the industry but will be gravely detrimental to it, they recognise that in view of the Govern-menfs declaration it becomes a question for Parliament to decide and not one that arises between the owners and workmen to discuss.The owners agree with the views expressed by the Commission that any general measure of compulsory amalgamation would be mischievous and that the best results are to be. As the first step accordingly to the making of a new wages agreement the Mining Association and the Miners&apos; Federation should meet nationally. The procedure to be followed there-after will depend upon the decisions then taken, it appears to us a reason-able course for the national conference to refer the question of minimum percentage and such other matters as they think appropriate to district associations to frame proposals. Those proposals would be submitted to the national conference for approval.

The amalgamation of many of the present small units of pro-duction is both desirable and practicable.   This   may   often   beIn deference to the Commission^ view the owners have accordingly already invited the Miners&apos; represen-tatives to meet them nationally with a view to the formulation of a national wages agreement. They propose that the two sides should proceed at once to consider the general principles to be incorporated in the agreement which would include the ratio between profits and wages, the details of the method of ascer-tainment and the definition of proceeds and of the items of costs of production. They further accept the principle of a minimum per-centage on basis rates in each district, and propose that the amount of this percentage and also (as hitherto) the amount of subsistence wages for the lower paid men should bereferred to the district associations.

As the first step accordingly to the making of a new wages agreement the Mining Association and the Miners&apos; Federation should meet nationally.

Those proposals would be submitted to the national conference for approval.
Recommendation. &quot;effected from within, but in many-cases it will only take place if outside assistance is given. Any general measure of compulsory amalgamation on arbitrary lines would be mis-chievous ; the action to be taken should be elastic and should enable each case to be treated individually. The State as mineral owner will be able to promote desirable amalgama-tions when granting new leases or renewing old ones. Legislation :should provide for a compulsory transfer of interests under existing leases where desirable amalgamations are prevented by the dissent of some of the parties or their unreasonable -claims. Existing leases would not otherwise be affected.9. Combination oe Industries.  A closer connection of mining with the allied industries should be pro-promoted. Highly technical questions are involved, affecting a number of industries, and not electricity alone. The development of electrical supply under the new proposals of the Government should be closely co-ordinated with the generation of electricity at the mines. The heat, power and light requirements of the country should be under the constant and comprehensive survey of a body formed for the purpose. We propose for consideration the establishment of a National fuel and Power Com-mittee with advisory powers composed of representatives nominated by the Government from among the official and other bodies concerned.10. Research   The existing provision for research should be largely extended by the industry with the support of the State. It is urgently necessary that new methods for winning and utilising coal should be sought for and be found, if the prosperity of the industry is to be restored and a proper standard of wages and working conditions assured to the workers. If processes of low temperature oarbonation  were   perfected,   greatOwners&apos; Reply.obtained where the initiative comes from the undertakings concerned. The owners note that the recom-mendation which the Commission make as to legislation is dealt with in the Governmenfs declaration, and, as in the case of the proposal for the nationalisation of minerals with which it is connected, it does not arise for discussion between owners and workmen, but becomes a question for Parliament.The owners agree with the views expressed by the Commission on the connection of mining with the allied industries. The establishment of the proposed National Fuel and Power Committee is dealt with in the Governmenfs declaration ; and the owners will welcome any assistance which such a Committee can render.The owners approve of the principle of extended research. They will welcome the co-operation of representatives of the workmen in this matter.
Recommendation. 1 national advantages would ensue particularly through the production of a smokeless fuel for domestic and industrial use, and the provision of large supplies of mineral oil from the country&apos;s own resources. The State should give financial support to the further experiments, on a commercial scale, which are necessary.Owners&apos; Reply. 61711. Distribution. The industry as a whole has so far failed to realise the benefits to be obtained by readiness to co-operate. Large financial advantages might be gained by the formation, hi particular, of co-operative selling agencies. They are specially needed in the export trade.The owners agree that any means which are practicable for obtaining the best prices possible for coal in the general interest should be adopted, and they will recommend that the districts shall give careful and immediate consideration to the measures which can best be taken to promote this object.12. The Government should con-sider the establishment of an official system for the sampling and analysis of coal, with a view to encouraging selling on specification and guarantee, in both the home and the foreign markets.13. Local authorities should be i empowered to engage in the retail sale I of coal.14. We propose measures to secure the adoption of larger mineral wagons on the railways, and a greater con-centration of ownership of wagons. A Standing Joint Committee of the Ministry of. Transport and the Mines Department should be formed to promote these measures.15. Labour.-The  relations between employers and employed are of fundamental importance, and here also we&apos; are convinced that a number of changes are. necessary.The owners will welcome any assistance from the Government in this respect. If by setting up official stations for the sampling and analysis of coal at the ports or else-where it is possible to get results which will be accepted as final by buyers abroad the owners think a benefit will be conferred on the industry.This is a matter for Parliament, and does not arise for discussion between owners and workmen.The owners note the Govern-rnenfs intimation that they will be prepared to constitute the proposed Standing Joint Committee of. the Ministry of Transport and the Mines Department. They will welcome whatever assistance such a com-mittee can render in connection with proposals for increasing the efficiency of the transport of coal.The owners are prepared to con-sider with the workmen the devising&apos; of machinery for the settlement of transfer prices which will leave no possible ground for doubt as to their fairness. G
Recommendation.The principle on which the recent wage agreements have been based is in our opinion sound, but amend-ments are needed in the method of ascertaining the proceeds of the industry for the fixing of wages. A large proportion of the coal is sold by the mines to associated industries, and the most important of these amendments relates to the prices at which these transfers are made.16. The standard length of the working day, which is now on the average 1\ hours underground, should remain unaltered. The optional re-distribution of hours within the present weekly total over a week of five days instead of six should be considered. The multiple shift system should be extended.17. Joint pit committees should be established generally.18. The methods of payment of men not employed at the face should be revised where possible so as to give them a direct interest in output.19. The introduction of a family allowance system, either nationally or by districts, is desirable. Pooling schemes should be adopted to prevent married men with families being pre-prejudiced in obtaining employment.ChyNERs&apos; Reply. They will also consider with the workmen the suggestions of the Commission relating to certain details of costs of production other than wages.   (Page 145 of report).While remaining convinced that a return to longer working hours is imperative to restore prosperity to the industry, in face of the emphatic declaration of the miners&apos; repre-sentatives that they will not enter-tain any suggestion in this direction the owners are anxious to consider with the miners the recommendation of the Commission that the definition of working time should be by the week instead of by the day, and that greater flexibility may be provided in the working hours.The owners accept the recom-mendation of the Commission in regard to multiple shifts.The owners accept the view expressed by the Commission that voluntary action is more likely to promote a friendly spirit than the compulsion of an Act of Parliament, and they accordingly are prepared to agree that pit committees shall be set up voluntarily at each pit, and that the constitution and functions of the committees shall be arranged nationally between them and the miners&apos; representatives.The owners accept this recom-mendation. The details of the methods to be adopted must necessarily be worked out pit by pit.This is mainly a question for the workmen. The owners do not express any view adverse to the principle of family allowances. The matter would have to be dealt with district by district as part of the subsistence wage arrangements.
99ei8Recommendation.20. Profit-sharing schemes, - pro-viding for the distribution to the workmen of shares in the undertakings should be generally adopted in the industry, and should be made obliga-tory by statute.2.1. For all new collieries a proper provision of houses for the workers should be a condition of the lease.22. The general establishment of pit head baths is necessary. This should be undertaken by the existing Miners&apos; Welfare Fund which should be increased by a substantial con-tribution from royalties.23. When prosperity returns to the industry we consider that annual holidays with pay should be estab-lished.Owners&apos; Reply. The owners are cordially in agree-ment as to the desirability of associating the workers as closely as possible with the success of the individual undertaking in which they are employed. The best results will be achieved by discussion between owners and workmen of schemes suited to the particular circumstances of individual under -takings.The owners are in favour of the provision of the best housing con-ditions that are practicable.The owners accept this recom-mendation.The owners think that this is a matter which hardly demands immediate attention but may be considered when prosperity returns to the industry.The owners propose that the two sides should meet at once to formulate the terms of the proposed National Wages Agreement, and that meetings should be held forthwith in the various districts to deal with the matters that call for the attention of the district associations, the most urgent of which is the settlement of the amount of the minimum percentage on basis rates and the amount of the subsistence wage in each district.
