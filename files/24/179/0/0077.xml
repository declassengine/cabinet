JjThis Document is the Property^of His Britannic. Majesty&quot;s Government. ] CONFIDENTIAL. 8 320STATE  PURCHASE  OF  MINING-  ROYALTIES.1. We were asked to advise on the methods by which Mining Royalties could be acquired by the State, without prejudice to the question whether or not such acquisition is in itself desirable.2. At the outset we have been impressed by the burden which the proposed acquisition of Mining Royalties will put upon the Treasury. Even supposing that it is possible over a long period of years to maintain intact the yield of the Mining Royalties, the creation of a large amount of new Government obligations cannot fail to have an effect on Government credit. This remains true even if they are issued for the purchase of a revenue-producing undertaking, and even if it is not a question of going to the money market for new capital, but of substituting capital in one form for capital already existing in another. In view of the importance of creating favourable conditions for the early conversion of war debt, it is essential at the present moment to avoid, so far as possible, a general depreciation in Government stocks. Our recommendations therefore are directed, so far as may be possible, to reducing the effect on general Government credit, while offering fair compensation to the Royalty owners.No purchase scheme can remain solvent unless the existing scale of royalties is maintained. We have assumed that the receipts will not fail below the present average gross figure of  6,341,000 per annum, new royalties taking the place of those that expire. Whether this assumption is well-founded depends largely on considerations outside our province.Consolidation of Mining Leases.3. If the problem were merely to eliminate the difficulties in practical working arising from the multiple ownership of Mining Royalties, we should have felt that a solution could be found in an extension of the Mines (Working Facilities) Act, 1923, giving definite rights to Colliery Proprietors to acquire mining leases where a, competent Court was satisfied that such rights should be given. This procedure might possibly have been supplemented by a power of compulsory acquisition by the State in individual cases, where necessary.Indeed, if the question is regarded solely as a business proposition, there would be much to be said for setting up a consolidated private company to hold all mining leases and to receive all mining royalties, the shares in which company would be held, pro rata to the compensation assessed by the proposed Compensation Authority, by the Royalty Owners, who would then receive from the company such dividend as the net royalties were able to pay. Such an organisation would enable the Colliery Owners to deal with one authority and would give the Royalty Owners the advantage of a mutual insurance against the risk of an individual loss (e.g., an explosion), together with the security of an authority appointed to watch over their interests and controlled by themselves as shareholders. Such a scheme would also, of course, avoid any competition with State Securities and any strain on Government credit.We realise that this scheme would not conform to the recommendations of the Royal Commission, but we suggest that in certain eventualities it might be well worth further exploration.A mount of Compensation.. 4.   In the case of State acquisition, the first question which we have to consider is the probable amount of compensation payable.The Royal Commission estimate this sum at  92,000,000, or, allowing for contingencies, a round sum of  100,000,000.  We learn from the Chief Valuer, Inland Revenue, that, of this sum of  92,000,000,  67,000,000 represents the estimated present value (on certain assumptions as regards valuation) of Royalties from coal [14378]
included m existing leases or being worked by the owner of the coal; the balance of  25,000,000 is a guess (for it can be little more) of the cost of acquiring rights to coal potentially workable but not actually worked, and, therefore, not at the moment earning any return to the Eoyalty owner. It should be observed that these detailed estimates have not been made public.The figure of  67,000,000 (or, allowing for contingencies,  70 million) is arrived at on the assumption that the coal under existing leases has an average life of thirty years, and will be valued by the compensation authority on the same basis as it is now usually valued for death duty purposes; that is to say, on a basis not higher than the 8 per cent, table. We draw attention in this connection to the fact that the market for Mining Royalties is narrow, and that, in consequence, the basis of market value is a doubtful one for a large purchase. We think it impor-tant that it should be laid down by statute as an instruction to the Compensation authority that it is to value these rights on the basis adopted for death duty taxation.In the Appendix we set out more fully provisions for this purpose.5. We think, further, that the transfer of Mining Rights to the State should be effected automatically by statute in order to reduce to the minimum the labour and cost of the making out of a large number of individual conveyances, and that the Royalty owners should be required to surrender to the State without further compen-sation all iplans, maps and other such records bearing on the working of the coal. For these they will normally, after the transfer, have no further use.&apos; They should retain right of access to such plans, &amp;c.(A.) Unworked Coal.6. The problem of the workable but unworked coal presents great difficulty. In the first place, any estimate of the value of coal which may come into working at a hypothetical future date is exceedingly difficult. The estimate of  25 millions included in the  92 millions makes allowance for the probable dates at which this coal will begin to attract royalties, but it is far from clear that a Compensation Authority might not deal with such cases on the analogy of coal which is already, in fact, being worked. In the second place, if this coal is acquired at once, the Royalty Fund will have to commence at once to make payments for it, although had it remained in private hands, the private owner would have received nothing for ten or thirty years, or possibly centuries. A new burden would thus be put on the industry or the State without any immediate counterpart. It may be argued that if such coal is not acquired at once, it will have to be acquired, when the moment comes, at the full cost of an actively working seam; that the remoteness of -an actual date of working ought to be taken into account by the compensating authority; and that the investment would be of such future value to the State as to overcome the objection to immediate payment. We agree that this argument may be actuarially correct. But in practice we think that the compensation authority could not hope to arrive in its present estimation of future chances at the actuarially correct solution. &quot;We think that inevitably coal would be paid for which would never be worked and at excessive prices; and we do not think that the State should, or, in present circumstances, can afford to, embark on such speculation.We recommend, therefore, that payment for this coal should not be made immediately, but should be dealt with according to the Scheme set out in paragraph 11 below.(B.) Existing Leases.7.   We turn now to the acquisition by the State of existing mining royalties.We assume that there is no question of purchasing these royalties for cash (which would give rise to very formidable market difficulties), but that they will be bought at a price to be assessed by the Compensation Authority and paid for in some form of security. .We have considered whether this security should take the form of a terminable annuity (which would make it less competitive with other Government Stocks) or should be secured on the royalties alone, without any liability on the Consolidated Fund. But we have come to the conclusion that these alternatives, though from some points of view attractive, would not offer the royalty owners a fair equivalent for their assessed compensation.We recommend, therefore, that payment should be made in the form of so mucn 4-i- per cent, guaranteed Coal stock as will give an interest yield equal to the interest
yield on 3^ per cent. Conversion Loan at the price of the day. At present prices this would mean the issue of per cent. Coal stock at 96^.* This stock should be secured primarily on the royalties and guaranteed by the Consolidated Fund, and should carry a minimum sinking fund of 1 per cent, per annum on the nominal amount issued. There should be an option to the State to redeem the stock at par in 1940 or after.Royalty Fund.8. We assume that the Royalties as received will be paid into a special statutory fund; and it is necessary now to consider the position of the income and expenditure account of the Royalty Fund, in our opinion, the Fund should clearly bear, in addition to the 5 per cent, for the Welfare Fund (a.) The cost of its administration.(6.) The liability which will in future fall to the State in respect of owners&apos;rates in Scotland, (c.) The loss to the State from the cessation of Mineral Rights Duty. (d.) A sum, which we think cannot be put at less than  500,000 per annum, as some compensation to the State for loss of income tax and super tax onthe difference between the present taxable income of royalty owners andtheir reduced income.from Coal Stock.We suggest that it is in principle important that where private property is acquired by the State an equivalent of the tax lost should be paid by the State undertaking in question to the Exchequer. Otherwise a fresh burden is being put on the general taxpayer.On the assumption that the total yield of mining royalties remains constant, the new royalties taking the place of those which cease, the account of the Fund might be expected to work out somewhat as follows :  1 Receipts. Expenditure.  &apos;  Estimated gross receipts Welfare Fund, 5 per cent.,from royalties        ...   6,341,000 say .........   250,000tAdministration   estimatedat 4 per cent, of turnover   254,000Scottish rates      ......   230,000Mineral  rights duty esti-mated at......       ...   240,000Minimum contribution for loss of tax on the differ-ence between present and future receipts of royalty owners, say      ...       ...   500,0001,474,000It is possible that some charge perhaps a heavy one-will fall on the Fund under existing leases for damage by subsidence, though we presume that under future leases this liability will be laid on the lessee. This will have to be taken into consideration in fixing the compensation.There will, therefore, be left at this point a balance, on the assumptions we have made, of between  41 and  5 million (say,  4f million).9. A further item which must be considered is the actual cost of acquisition It is impossible to form more than a very vague estimate of this charge, but we are informed that it might amount to between &amp;l\ million and  2 million. We think this sum should be charged against the Royalty Fund over a period of not more than 20 years, and repaid by the Fund by a flat annuity. This will necessarily mean that the State must provide from Votes the amounts originally required, being recouped over the 20-year period.   The annuity required would be about  154,000.* At 75, 3-i- per cent. Conversion Loan yields  4 13s. Ad.    4i per cent, at 96^ yields  4 18.s. 3d. t This is the figure indicated in the Coal Commissions Report, page 209.   It is clearly calculated on some net figure less than the gross figure of  6,341,000, but we do not know its exact basis.[14378] B 2
10. Interest on the  66,500,000 (being  70 million less the 5 per cent, diverted to welfare) at the rate of  4 13,?. 4rd., would amount to  3,103,000, leaving an approximate annual balance on the Fund of about  1,500,000, a figure sufficient to bring the minimum 1 per cent, sinking fund (which would redeem the stock in just under 40 years) up to about 2-J- per cent. If the whole of this surplus were applied to purchase of Coal Stock in the market (or by drawings if the stock stands above par) for cancellation, this sinking fund might be expected to redeem the original stock in about 25 years, as compared with an estimated average life of 30 years in existing coal leases. As, however, it will be necessary to make provision for interest on further stock issued in accordance with paragraph 11 below for new coal coming into working after the initial purchase, this period of 25 years will be extended to rather under 40 years. Thereafter there would be a further period of years in which the sinking fund would be cancelling further stock issued for new coal, but it might be hoped that within about 60 years the sinking fund would have cancelled all stock so that further purchases could be made in cash.We recommend that the surplus income of the Fund should be applied by statute to the redemption of Coal Stock, though the State should not guarantee more than the minimum 1 per cent, sinking fund suggested in paragraph 7.11. As regards unworked coal (in so far as under the Commission^ report this is to be acquired on compensation terms) we recommend: (a.) That a register of such coal should be established forthwith and that any person wishing to be placed on this register in respect of any area of land should be required to satisfy the compensation authority that there is evidence of coal having marketable value. If the authority is satisfied on this point the title to claim compensation if and when the coal is in fact worked should be registered. No compensation would be payable except in respect of title claimed, in a prescribed-form, within a period of two years from the passing of the Act. No coal so registered should be leased except through the Mines Department.(b.) If at any subsequent date coal belonging to a claimant who had so registered his title came into working, it should then be paid for by the State on the basis of the Royalties then created, capitalised in the sarnie manner as that proposed for now existing- Royalties, either in 4^ per cent, stock at. the then appropriate market price as compared with 3^ per cent. Conversion Loan, or at the State&apos;s option in the equivalent cash.It will be seen that this proposal relieves the State of immediate liability to purchase coal not actually in working, and provides that it should only buy so much of such coal as in fact is in future worked and on a basis of compensation reached on (then) known facts and not on mere speculation.12. It will be appreciated that the calculations in the preceding paragraphs are necessarily based on many assumptions. We give them as an indication of not unreasonable expectation. We could not regard them as anything more; and we should deprecate their being publicly used as definite financial forecasts.Complete Immediate Purchase.13. If it is thought to be politically essential to pay at once for all coal including unworked coal, we do not see how such purchase can be carried out even supposing the estimate of  100,000,000 does not prove to be too low without loss to the State, resulting in a charge on the general taxpayer. Even with so low a sinking fund as % per cent, the service of the stock would involve an annual charge of  5,167,000.It would be extremely improbable that allowing for the other charges which we think that the Royalty Fund should bear, the fund could be solvent (even if future Royalties can be levied in respect of new exploitations at rates hitherto customary) tor many years to come, and the deficit might easily be considerable.But we entertain grave doubts whether in fact the compensation award for unworked coal would not considerably exceed the allowance made for it in the above figure of  100 million.For the reasons given in paragraph 6 we cannot recommend immediate payment for unworked coal and we greatly prefer the scheme for its acquisition outlined in paragraph 11.
If immediate payment has, however, to be contemplated we believe the only means of safeguarding the taxpayer against a wholly indeterminate liability is to fix by statute a maximum sum for the purchase of these rights leaving the division of this sum between the claimants to be fixed by the compensating body.On reflection we do not think the suggestion is so revolutionary as it sounds. We are greatly impressed by the difficulty in determining in each particular case the period likely to elapse before minerals come into working and the rate of exhaustion. In fact it is clearly impossible for any tribunal to make an accurate forecast, the future being beyond control. The best that could be done would be to reflect as far as practicable in the compensation in each case the opinion of the market at the time. But this market is very limited and isolated examples of actual transfers may be very misleading if adopted as a general guide.If, as is likely to be the case, claimants generally tried to establish their claims by geological evidence supported by optimistic witnesses before a tribunal whose unconscious but natural inclination would probably be to give the claimant the benefit of the doubt, it may be found that the State on acquisition would be called upon to pay a sum &quot;higher than is required in equity &quot; (p. 80 of the report) especially in the case of undeveloped minerals.We think, therefore, that no such scheme should be put into operation which is not governed by a Statutory limitation that the total capital liability to the State for Compensation in respect thereof shall not exceed   4,000,000.We are satisfied that any greater sum would be &quot;higher than is required in equity.&quot; In fact it is doubtful, even if it is assumed that the present output will be maintained, and that under future economic conditions royalties on the basis at present customary can continue to be charged, whether the undeveloped minerals are worth more than  21,000,000.To give effect to this recommendation it may be necessary to provide : (a.) For the appointment of a Tribunal to investigate and review all claims. (&amp;.) For the equitable distribution by the Tribunal among claimants of the maximum sum available, assuming-(1.) That the present output of coal throughout the country is likely to be maintained;(2.) That the rates of royalty customary in the District at the time of the introduction of the Bill are likely to continue;and having regard to (3.) The period likely to elapse before such royalties would begin to accrue;(4.) The net revenue likely to be derived from royalties when they arise; (5.) The number of years during which such royalties would be likely to continue; and(6.) Any other factors likely to influence. the value of the royalties.BRADBURY.W. PLENDER.O. E. NIEMEYER.April 7, 1926.
(See end of \ 4.)The following suggestions are made with the view to carrying out the recommendations of the Royal Commission so far as concerns Compensation generally: 1. The Valuation should not in any case be greater than the sum which is reached by using for all purposes of discounting and capitalisation the ordinary 8 per cent, compound interest table; subject to the proviso that, where any owner can prove that a higher standard has in fact been adopted within, say, ten years as the basis of Assessment to Estate Duty in respect of the minerals the subject of dispute, that standard shall in that particular case be substituted as the maximum.2. It should be made clear that this maximum standard of compensation is to apply only to the least speculative and most attractive seams and areas.3. In all cases where a royalty is not in fact reserved before the date of the introduction of the Bill the net annual income for capitalisation should be ascertained on a basis not higher than the rate of royalties customary in the district at that date.4. In no case should the amount of compensation be increased by reason of the acceptance or operation of the proposals contained in the Coal Com-mission&apos;s report or any modification or development thereof which may, in fact, be adopted.5. The terms of acquisition of the Reversionary Interest to possession of a coal-mine after the expiration of an existing lease should be governed by the practice customary in the industry that, the lessee would normally be granted a fresh lease in respect of any workable coal remaining unworked on the expiration of his term.6. Compensation for any damage to the surface should be deferred until such damage occurs. So far as concerns all new leases, this liability would be on the lessee. So far as concerns existing leases where any such liability may attach to the State and not be recoverable from the lessee, steps should be taken either by limitation of workings or otherwise to avoid undue burdens upon the State.o
