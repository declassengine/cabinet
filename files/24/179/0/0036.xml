The President of the Board of Education and the Minister of Labour were subsequently added to the Committees2.     The attention of the Committee has been drawn to the archaic character of much of the law regarding sedition and mutiny, to the difficulty of deciding whether any particular language is or is not seditious owing to the absence of any statutory definition of that offence, and to the serious delays before convictions can be obtained arising out of the fact that common law offences such as engaging in a seditious conspiracy,  the writing or uttering of seditious libels and the incitement of persons
to commit crimes) can only be dealt with on indictment before a jury.     The same is true of offences under the Incitement to Mutiny Act, 1797 under which It is a felony to endeavour to seduce any member of His Majesty&apos;forces from their allegiance or to incite them to mutiny. Except in the case of offences by aliens    under the Aliens Restriction Amendment Act, 1919,  or offences under the Malicious Damages Act,  1861, or the Police Act, 1919, there is no summary procedure which can be employed.30    The Cabinet will recall that in his Memorandum the Attorney-G-eneral suggested that the law regarding seditnon should be strengthened by enacting legislation substantially in the form of the draft Preservation of Public Order Bill which was prepared by a Cabinet Committee in 1921, and by incorporating therein a statutory definition of sedition somewhat on the lines of the Australian legislation enacted by a Commonwealth Labour Government,40    The case for the draft Bill of 1921 may be summarised as followsDirect and explicit incitement to the unlawful use of force or violence, or unlawful injury to persons or property, ought not to be and cannot safely be left un-checkedj    the effect of inaction is cumulative, and the result of ignoring flagrant offences is to encourage the erroneous notion that the ordinary law provides no check on inflammatory speeches or writings.      The law,  as it stands, punishes the subordinate who commits some violent act at the instigation of another, but leaves practically untouched the organiser and advocate of a campaign of
violence and outrage.    While there is power under&quot;the Malicious Damages Act,  1861,   to deal summarily with persons guilty of aiding and abetting a crime which is actually committed,  there is no power to deal summarily with the far more dangerous person who incites and encourages others to commit offences.      The procedure by indictment is wholly unsuited to most of the cases in which prosecution is desirable;    the elaborate process of a trial at Assizes is generally out of proportion to the offence;    the offender is given an exaggerated importance and advertisement;    the presence on the Jury of one person who is in sympathy with his views or is terrorised by his associates may render the trial abortive; and if the offender is convicted and sentenced for sedition or for seditious libel he must be treated in prison as a first class misdemeanant (Prisons Act, 1877,  Section 40). Further, the delay between the offence and the conviction often deprives the sentence of much of its value as a deterrent.    In the provinces there may be a delay cf four or five months between committal and trial, and the Assizes may not take place until the emergency which was the dcoasion fcr the offence has come to an end. 5.      On the other hand the very serious difficulties incidental to any general legislation on this subject must not be overlooked.    It is essential to avoid,  se far as possible,  the imputation that legislation is designed unduly to interfere with freedom of speech. Any proposal- which deprives the subject of trial by Jury is bound to be very jealously scrutinised, and it may be desirable to restrict within narrow limits the power of summary prosecution,  to reserve it for use only in times
of great emergency or for the purpose of checking specially dangerous offenders.      Past experience shows that, except In moments of national crisis, the passage through Parliament of proposals for dealing with sedition presents exceptional difficulties, an - there is every reason to believe that future attempts to legislate would meet with even greater opposition and obstruction,6.      Representations have been made to the Committee respecting the highly objectionable and dangerous efforts made by the Communists to undermine the loyalty of and create disaffection amongst members of the Fighting Services.      It has been suggested that any legislation should include a provision on the general lines of Wo,21(1) of the Draft Regulations under the Emergency Powers Act 1920, and. that opportunity might at the same time be taken to lay down a statutory definition of &quot;disaffection&quot;,      The Cabinet will appreciate the difficulty of legislating against propaganda ostensibly directed towards the betterment of conditions in the Fighting Services,     Under Clause 1  (d) of the draft Preservation of Public Order Bill (Appendix I) It would he an offence to attempt or do any act calculated or likely to cause mutiny,  sedition or disaffection among an7/ cf His Majesty&apos;s Forces,-      It might be found impracticable to pass into law provisions of a more stringent character.7.     The Committee concur in the view that the sedition law needs codifying and strengthening on the general lines proposed by the Attorney-General,  and,  In order that a Bill for that purpose may be available if required,  they have caused to be prepared a draft Preservation of Public Order Bill,  a copy of which Is annexed hereto.
8-      The Committee have carefully considered the questionwhether it is desirable to introduce legislation forthwithon the lines Indicated above.     The successful issue ofthe recent prosecution of the Communist leaders hasobviated any necessity for immediate legislation to dealwith the particular situation out of which that prosecutionarose.      Any attempts to legislate on this subject must be extremely contentious, and the heavy programme of essentialGovernment business in the present Parliamentary Sessionrenders the passage into law of a Sedition Bill almostimpracticable, while the mere introduction of such a bill might precipitate an industrial crisis.      In these circum-stances it appears to the Committee that the wisest coursewould be to postpone consideration of the question of theintroduction of any legislation until it is seen how theindustrial situation will develop in the near future.The Committee accordingly recommend to the Cabinet(1) That while It is desirable to formulate legisla-tion on the general lines of the draft Preservation of Public Order Bill annexed to this Report, no useful purpose would be served by attempting to introduce such legislation at the present moment..e Legal     g0      The Committee have examined the practicability ofjfpects ofgeneral     rendering illegal a general strike which is directed, not Irike.against the employer, but against the State,  and In this connection they have considered the possibility of dealing specially with strikes in the essential Public Services,
namely,  the production and supply of food, water, fuel light, electric power, and transport.      It has been suggest -ed that it might be desirable to enact that in the event of a strike or lock-out occurring or being threatened in any of these services,  the Minister of Labour may refer the dispute to a Court of Enquiry under the Industrial Courts Act, that until that Court has reported it shall be illegal to strike or organise a strike in the particular industry, and that in the meantime the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 shall be suspended as to that industry.      It is represented that the existence of statutory powers of this character would have a salutary effect in preventing a. strike or look-out in the essential services taking plane and in limiting the sympathetic extension of any such strike or lock-out to      On the other hand it has been urged that the intervention of the State would most effectively take place after the actual outbreak of a general strike, when public opinion would be in full sympathy with..,  and would actively support,  the Government in any drastic measures that might he necessaryj that there would be great practical difficulties in differentiating between strikes in essential services directed against the community, and ordinary industrial strikes; and that the introduction of any such legislation would be more likely to precipitate than to prevent a general strike, would be regarded by the Trade Unions as the first step towards the repeal of the Trades Disputes Act, and would be most bitterly misrepresented and opposed.     The Corr-ittee were reminded that the existing arrangements for the adjustment of disputes in the railway service had been settled by agreement between the Companies and the Unions concerned before they were made statutory by Part IV of the Railway Act 1921,
10. Jn tills connection the Committee have examined thedraft Emergency Regulations under the Emergency Powers.Act-------1920 which hsve been prepared for publication in the event cf a general dislocation of the essential aervie-ea t   These Regulations ns drafted provide (in Clause 21)  that,, any person who does any&apos;&quot; as t calculated or likely to impede delay or restrict any treasures taken for securing and regulating the supply or distribution of food, water, fuel, light or other neceg,necessities, or for -maintaining the means of transit or of locomotion, or for any ofher purposes essen-tial to the public safety or the life of the corimmnity aha^l be guilty of an offenpe and be punishable, accordingly; but there is annexed to tfeie regulation the following &quot;proviso t-^Provided that a person shall not be guilty of any offence under this regulation by reason only ef his taking part ia a strike or peacefully persuading any other person to take part&apos; in a strike&quot;.This proviso is in accord with the provisions of theEmergency Powers Act 1920,.;. but the effect of it is torend r the regulation of little use for the purpose nowunder consideration.    It is desirable that, if an opportunity-&apos;nity scours,  the provision in the Apt which renjfrers thisproviso neoeasary should be repealed, -The.Committee report to ths Cabinet:-(2) That while no useftil purpose Would be served by the early introduction of legislation to deal with strikes or lock-otits in essential services on the general lines indicated above the qu.es-tion of the desirability of passing such legislation into law should be reserved for immediate consideration on the $happening of the next industrial emergency/(?)  That when an opportunity occurs the second proviso to Section 2(1) of the Emergency Powers Act 1920 should be repealed.-7-0 The -Committee have approved a Draft -Bill.which has been prepared to give effect to the above, proposals . It  is not thought necessary to circulate &quot;copies of this Eill at.the present stage but a copy will be available at the Offices of the&apos; Cabinet^   for the inspection of Ministers.
FACTORY 11.    The attention of the Committee has &quot;been drawnPAPERS.to the increasing output of papers, usually hoc to graphed, which are being issued by communists in workshops, factories and pits.    As a rule  these papers bear no publisher&apos;s name or address,  and as they are not printed the Newspapers Act does not apply to them. Several of the papers are said to be of a mischievous character,  and the Director   of Public Prosecutions has suggested that it might be possible to include some provision dealing with papers of this kind in any proposed legislation.So    fsr as they are seditious the papers r*an be dealt with under the existing, law, and if a summary procedure is provided under the legislation in oon-templation, action will be correspondingly facilitated.The extension of the Newspapers Act, 1869, to multi-graphed documents presents speoial difficulties both as to the nature of the documents to which it should extend and as to the possibility of any effective enforcement.While the Committee agree generally that it is--very doubtful whether an attempt to apply the Newspapers Aot to  the papers in question would be successful, thev hive thought it desirable to include in-8-
the draft Preservation of Public Order Bill provisions on the lines of Clause 4 and. the Schedule to the attached draft.12.    In compliance with the request of the Cabinet,ICIN OS       the Committee have reconsidered the question of the 1908possible strengthening of the Public Meetings Act. The desirability of giving the police further powers for the purpose of keeping order at public meetings was considered in 1909 by a Home Office Departmental Committee presided ever by the Right Honourable Henry Hobhouse.      (For this Committee 1s Report see Cmd. Paper 4673 of 1909).      That Committee found that the police practice on the subject varied, throughout the country,  and while agreeing that the police should generally refuse to undertake the duty of keeping order inside public buildings, the Committee suggested that on extraordinary occasions when there is a definite reason to apprehend disturbance of a serious character the Chief Constable should on the application of responsible persons convening a meeting arrange for policing the meeting inside as well as outside,  and they considered that this should be done without payment.    In trans-mitting the Report to the Chief Constables the then Home Secretary expressed a hope that police practice In this matter would be regulated in accordance with the Committee&apos;8 recommendation,  pointing out at the same time that when the Committee spoke of &quot;policing&quot; a meeting they did not mean that  the police were to act as stewards but only that they were to be ready to deal with actual disturbers of the peace.The Hobhouse Committee also considered, the question whether the Public Meetings Act should be strengthened
by adding a power of arrest without warrant either upon the actual commission of the offence or upon refusal to give a true name and address when asked.     The Committee, however,  concluded that arrest by the police of interrupters on the spot would probably tend further to excite hostile opinion and might even be regarded with disfavour by some persons favourable to the objects of the meeting.      &quot;We think&quot;, they said,  &quot;that as a rule it will be possible to identify the disturbers for the purpose of issuing a summons if desired,  and that some further experience of the working of the Act, both as an effective weapon and as a weapon in tex&apos;rorem,  is required before its amendment should be considered by Parliament&quot;.The Home Secretary doubts the desirability of modifying existing police practice In regard to keeping order at public meetings..     Before, however, committing himself definitely he proposes to confer generally on the subject with representative Chief Constables.Though in most parts of the country the right of open discussion in public meetings is respected, there have recently been signs in such places as Battersea and the Clyde of organised attempts to render such discussions impossible.plenipoteniary 13^      The Conclusions reached by the Committee may become-SIONS.      summarised as follows(1) That the lav/ respecting sedition needs codifying and strengthening by the passage into law of legislation on the lines of the draft Preservation of Public Order Bill annexed.(2) That no useful purpose would, however, be served by introducing legislation of this character at the present moment.
(3) That, while it is at the moment undesirable to introduce legislation dealing with strikes or lock-outs in essential services directed against the State,  the question of making illegal such strikes or lock-outs until a Court of Enquiry has reported on the particular dispute, and in the meantime of suspending the Trades Disputes Act of 1906,  should be reserved for immediate consideration on the happening of the next industrial emergency,(4) That, ??hen a suitable opportunity ogouts, the second proviso to Section 2(1) of the Emergency Powers Act 1920 should be repealed,(5) That there should be further enquiry and consideration by the Home Secretary of the possibility of making the Public Meetings Act more effective.(Signed on behalf of the Committee)CAVE,Chairman.House of Lords,  S.W.1, 25th March,  1926,
