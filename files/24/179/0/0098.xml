The immediate occasion of the raising cf the  issue at that date was the fact that two Established Moulders at Portsmouth had absented themselves from duty as Member of the  Iron Pounders &apos; Trade Union which had ordered a strike of its members on account cf a dispute with which the Government service was not in any way concerned.The Cabinet authorised the Admiralty to allow these two men to come back to work on the termination of the strike on the under-standing that they would bo treated as having been absent without leave- and the fact of their being so abesnt without leave would be noted in their record so that due notice would be taken of It by the Treasury in deciding the amount of pension to be awarded when they ultimately came to be superannuated.      The Admiralty at the same time vioro authorised to negotiate with the Trade Union in order4 to secure that If the two men that struck y/ore reinstated., Established men belonging to tho Union should suffer no loss  on their Trade Union privileges., the Minister of Labour having pointed out that, under the Terms  of the Settlement of the Iron Pounders &apos; strike, there was to  be no victimisation on either s ide *It appeared that the only previous  Instance of a strike of Government Established Servants wes the strike of LondonPos tmen. . ... &apos;
postmen in 1890, when 450 men were summarily dismissed, and while the majority of the Es tablishe d men were subsequently reinstated they forfeited their pay in the interval and suffero a reduction of pension, which was stated to amount to 10/&amp;.     Th postmaster General reported that the offset of. these penalties was widely known end was still ox ere is in g a salutary effect.There was a feeling in the Cabinet that It was important that the Cabinet should make a definite declaration of the position of Established men who took part in the strike,  and suggestions were made to deal with the matter by legislation which would deprive any such strikers  of their pension rights . in the end,  at a Cabinet meeting on the 12th October, 192q, the Cabinet agreed -(a) That  it was desirable that the  Government should state its position on this particular issue at the earliest moment t(b) That the Treasury should Instruc^ the Official Side of the Shipbuilding Trade Joint Council to make a state--ment in the following terms&quot;it is true that there is no statutory prohibition of strikes by Civil Servants.     Such a prohibition has not hitherto been found necessary,  for Civil Servants have recognised that the fact that they are Servants  of the State and the conditions  of their es establishment with pension on retirement Impose special obligations upon them and differentiato their case from that of the employees of any private trader for profit.&quot;But the principle upon which Parliament has proceeded in giving legal sanction to the award of pensions to Civil Servants is that they should have rendered faithful and satisfactory service,  and this primary condition cannot be held to have been satisfied in the case of servants of the State who by striking have endangered or prevented the carrying on of the public sercxLce for which Government is responsible to Parliament and the community.&quot;When this statement was accordingly made the Trade Union.side of the Council expressed great dissatisfaction and suggested that the announcement was contrary to the spirit and;meaning of the Trades Dispute Act,  and enquired, the name ofa ft a * * * *
the Cabinet Minister who has authorised the announcement . The Official Side replied, under instruction, that the decision was that of the whole Cabinet and wag adhered to,Nothing further has passed on this subject until the pre sent cr is is .On Tuesday evening, May 4th, at a meeting of the employees of the Royal Victoria Victualling Yard at Deptford, and of the Naval Store Department men at the same place, it was decided to join in the general strike forthwith.     Next morning, Wednesday   May 5th, :out of 10 5 Established men in the Victualling Yard 73 presented themselves  and the other 32 failed to appear.      Of the Naval Store Department established men, 1 Storehous em an and 6 Skilled Labourers were also absent.On the eve of the next pay day, May 7th,  I ordered, with the approval of the Prime Minister, that any of these absentee established men who present themselves this morning to get their arrears  of pay should be handed a notice by the Superintendent quoting the terms  of the announcement made in 192o by the Cabinet as a warning of the effect that may result to their pension rights,  apart from any other consequence that may happen to them as  a result of their absence from duty.When the  General Strike was called off on the 12th. May,28 of the Victualling Department established men and 5 of thetheNaval Store Department men were still on strike.      I authorisedSuperintendent of the Yard to inform the men as follows&quot; The Established men who have been on strike and had not returned by this morning are to be suspended, from duty pending the consideration of their future treatment,&quot;On the 13th May none of the men oh strike,  established.or hired, returned to duty, the Union Officials having,  Iunderstand, given instructions that unless all the men who havebeen m. strike were re-Instated, none were to return.
u.    4    -A dec is ion is now required as to the treatment of these 33 Admiralty established employees  who have taken part in the strike and have remained absent from duty in spite of the warning issued to them on the 7th Kay.I understand that these are the  only established employees in the whole of the public service of the Crown who have joined in the strike.      I do not think it is  advisable to treat the 2 Moulders were treated- in 192 o, and merely regard thorn as them as/being absent without leave, with a notation on theirrecord that may affect their ultimate pension if they surviveuntil they are superannuated.      These men had no grievance as totheir wages or conditions  of employment end took part withoutany notice,  in a definite attempt to embarrass and hold up thepublic service, although prior to being established they had signed a document which Included the following undertakings(a) &quot;I promise to render faithful service, to obey theinstructions  of my superior officers,  and at all times to use my best endeavours  for the advantage of His Majestyfs Service;(b) &quot;l undertake to serve under the  conditions laid downrespecting the employment of persons in H.M.Naval Establishments,  as set out in the regulations and supplementary instructions  issued,   or which may be issued from time to time,  by the Admiralty&quot; ;(c) &quot;l shall be ready to: perform my duties to the  full extent of my ability at all such times and on such occasions as may in the opinion of my superior officers be necessary to meet tho exigencies  of HeMcService, subject to the observance of such conditions  in respect of periods  of rest and rates of payment as may from time to time be prescribed by the Admiralty&quot; ^(d) &quot;l am also fully aware that my continued employment asan Established employee, provided that my services do not become redundant, would be dependent upon the observance of the fore going c on dit ions  and my continuing to render efficient service  ....... ljIn my opinion, their disregard of these undertakings Is so flagrant that the proper course is to dismiss all these 33 men from the Service and re-employ them,  if they wish, as Hirec&quot; Men.W.
