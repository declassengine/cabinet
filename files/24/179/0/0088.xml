(THE   DCCUivlEt:ITI  THE PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNE   MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEhNM^flft?)THE INDUSTRIAL POSITION.Memorandum by the Chance11or of the Duchy ofLaricaster,As I am going away to Geneva for two or three weeks I venture to trouble my colleagues with the following observations  :-1.    It is impossible for any one to say how long the general strike will last..    But it may easily last for several weeks if the revolutionary element are able to keep the non-revolutionaries up to the mark.     Even so,  though evory fair opportunity for peace must of course be taken,  I am of opinion that it would be a grave error to allow even the appearance of success to the general strike. Eor this reason I doubt the wisdom of taking any such action as that proposed by Lord Eustace Percy at the present moment.      But I believe that action on those lines should be taken the moment the general strike collapses,   and that therefore the Cabinet would perhaps do well to have the proposals put into proper form so as to be available immediately when wanted.2,      The Government will have to consider immediately on the collapse of the strike,  if not before, what changes of the law,  if any,  are desirable in view of recent events.    I am doubtful whether it would be advisable to repeal the Trades Disputes Act or even to impose on the Unions a secret ballot before striking,      As far as peaceful picketing is concerned,  it has always been very questionable whether the Trades Disputes Act made any difference in the existing lav/.    It certainly did not legalise intimidation as some people appear to think, and it is intimidation which has been used in this strikeSECRET.C A BIN E T.c.p&quot;, 188 (26).
and will be usnfl in all considerable strikes in th? future-    It is quite illegal, but it Is very difficult to stop.    Nor am I clear that we should gain anything by destroying the funds of the Trades Unions under the Tr.ff Vale decision, apart from the rancour which any such step would excite.    I do not believe that it would be desirsble to destroy the Trades Unions:    indeed if they were destroyed something --would have to be invented to take their place, and I can think of nothing.    As for a secret ballot I gravely doubt if it would make any practical difference.    But I do feel very strongly that a differen-negotiation should be mode between the ordinary industrial strike and a general strike,  and that the latter should be treated as a criminal conspiracy,    No doubt it may be difficult to devise words which will apply to a general strike and would not apply to an industrial strike, but I cannot think it is impossible.    The distinction between a combination aimed at putting pressure on the Government by hampering or impeding.the trade and industry of the country, and the action of employers or employed in putting an end to work in an industry because they are net agreed as to wages or conditions of work, is a very broad and real one.3.      I am more than ever convinced that the Governmentwill be srravely to blame unless as soon as possible after itthe Strike/takes up a reorganisation of the industry of the country with a view to diminishing the suspicion which at present prevails between employers and employed.In the pamphlet &apos;Locking Ahead&apos;  issued on the 14th June, 1924,  the Unionist Party is pledged to &quot;take steps to promote feelings of mutual confidence amongst all those engaged in trade and -industry, and to encourage the admission of the workers, by the application of the principle of co-partnership,  to a direct share in the success of tho undertakings /

Certainly they were invited to doso with groat force and offoctivoness in the speechesof the Prims Minister.     Unhappily this strike shewsthat little or nothing Lee beon accomplished, and Iam deeply convinced that unless we can devise someremedy for tho disease cf industrial suspicion, the electorate will sooner or later accept some form ofsocialism as tha only way suggested out of thedifficulty.     It isn11 merely strikes thafrw. e haveto complain cf.     It is the want of willingness towork, resulting in the oxoessive cost of production,that is hampering our whole economic revival.     after all cheap production in not inconsistent with highwages in the United States, and there may well be semeforce in the contentions put forward on this subject insuch pamphlets as &quot;The Secret of High W&amp;ges&quot; which mycolleagues may have seen.
