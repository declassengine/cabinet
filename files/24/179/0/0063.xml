CP. 163(26) .This document issecret.(in continuation of CP. 81  (26))1.    GENERAL POSITION.I am glad to be able to present a satisfactory Report on the state of the organisation for which, as Chairman of the Supply and Transport Committee of the Cabinet, 1 am responsible. The personnel required is now complete  (except for a small number of vacancies which will be filled before the end of the month) and is in full possession of instructions so far as is considered practicable in advance of an emergency.      The issue of instructions is being fortified by a series cf conferences held in London between the Departments chiefly affected and their divisional representatives.      No serious defects have been disclosed by the tests which have thus been applied to tho machinery and I believe that the preparations have been made as definite and complete as is possible before the event having regard to the restrictions under which we have worked.In the event of a coal stoppage only,  it is in contemplate-tion that, as a measure of precaution, Divisional Offices should be opened and Oivil Commissioners and their staffs should proceed to their Divisions, until it can be seen whether an extension is probable or not;    but it is not proposed to call on the Volunteer Service Chairmen to function, unless this should be found necessary.2 .    COMMITTEES.It has not been necessary for either the Cabinet Committee or the Standing Sub-Committee to meet since the Report of 22nd February, but the informal Conferences referred to in paragraph 2
of that Report have continued to be held at regular intervals and have been able to do much useful work in attending to the details of the  organisation.A Final Report has been submitted by the Sub-Committee on the question of compensation in respect of damage to trans-port lent or requisitioned in connexion with an emergency etc. and the position appears to be much more satisfactory than was at first considered probable, since companies are now prepared to undertake advance insurance against sabotage at a trifling premium. These facilities are being brought to the notice of haulage firms by the Ministry of Transport.3.  CIVIL COMMISSIONERS&apos;  ORGANISATION.(a) Complete arrangements have been made for the emergency offices for the Civil Commissioners and their staffs to be ready for occupation at 24 hours&apos; notice with all necessary equipment and furniture.(b) There is only one vacancy among the 99 Chairmen of Volunteer Service Committees.      Arrangements have been made for the temporary charge of the area concerned (Bethnal Green), should an emergency occur before the vacancy is filled.(c) The Chairmen of Volunteer Service Committees are ready to open recruiting stations without delay, if the necessity arises.      In most places these would be on premises supplied by the local authority, but in nine instances the local authority is unable or unwilling to assist.      Except at Greenwich, Lincoln and Merthyr Tydfil there  is no reason to attribute the unwillingness to a desire on the part of the local authorityto be obstructive.(d) Local Authorities or their officers are generally prepared to undertake the responsibility for local services in an emergenoy, and there has been little evidence lately of the misunderstandings with which the circular of 20th November 1925 was received in some quarters  (see paragraph 4 of Report of 22nd February).
(e)  Since last February several cf the Civil Commissioners have visited their Divisions or met members of their staffs in London.      In all Divisions there have been meetings of Divisional Staffs and Volunteer Service Committees for discussion and consultation.     A Conference of Chief Assistants to Civil Commissioners was held to-day.4. TRANSPORT.(a) Road Transport.(i) There are now 147 road centres in England and Wales outside London, and the appointment cf Road Officers and Chairmen of Haulage Committees of all these centres has now been completed.      In addition there is the London Haulage Committee with eight Road Officers, all of whom have been appointed.      Tho arrangement! under which the police should supply Road Officers with lists of mechanically propelled commercial vehicles in the various areas has now been completed.(ii) A further memorandum setting out the method of operating vehicles under priority orders, directions, or, in a last rosort, requisitioning has been sent to Road Officers and Chairmen of Haulage Committees.(iii) A draft Agreement under which contractors would operate requisitioned vehicles on Government account has been drawn up in consultation with the Commercial Motor Users Association and the London Haulage and Cartage Contractors Association.      The form of this Agreement was circulated with the memorandum referred to above, and the Chairmen of Haulage Committees were asked to summon their Committees in order to consider it.(iv) With a view to obtaining a supply of volunteer drivers for commercial vehicles on the out-break of an emergency Road Commissioners have been instructed to formulate schemes under which individuals cculd be trained at important centres throughout the provinces.(v) Following the decision of the Cabinet at their Meeting cn April 14th and after some further discussion of
details amongst the Ministers directly affected,- a contract has been prepared by the War Office,  in consultation with the Ministry of Transport, whereby a fleet of some 460 lorries and charabancs with their drivers will be at the disposal of the Government at any time between May 1st and September 30th, should either the Military or Civil Authorities find it necessary to mobilize the whole or any part of it.      This contract has not actually been signed, pending the completion of a formal draft;    but the contractors have been authorized to act as though it had been signed, and the preparations are already in train.      I regard this definite reserve of transport as a valuable addition to the resources of the Government in case of emergency, (b) Railways.The Minister of Transport has kept in touch with the Railway Companies.      He is satisfied-that the Companies are fully alive to their public responsibilities and that their emergency plans are, generally speaking, well advanced.5. ELECTRICAL POWER STATIONS IN THE GREATER LONDON AREA.Sufficient volunteers have beon obtained and allocated to ensure that the stations covered by the London Electrical Power scheme oan be run to at least&quot;two-thirds capacity, and it is hoped that the shortage  still remaining will be met as a result of further appeals now being made.6. FOOD SERVICES.(a) Divisional Staff .The Staff of Divisional Food Officers includes 24 technical assistants of whom 25 have been appointed and are in possession of their instructions.      These officers are attending conferences with or convened by Divisional Officers and aro devoting a considerable amount of time to preparatory work -in the majority of cases without fee or remuneration.
(b) Local Emergency Food Officers.In February it was reported that the appointment of a Local Food Officer in 309 districts had been approved and that the number then appointed was 267.      It has recently been decided to increase the number of Local Food Officers in South Wales by 37 on account of the particular difficulties of the division and in order more easily to harmonise with the organisation of other departments.      The total number of appointments authorised has therefore been increased to 346, and in 331 towns the individual concerned has been selected and appointed.     Of the 15 vacancies 2 are due to resignation or death, and the remaining vacancies are among those recently authorised for South &quot;Wales.      It is anticipated that the out-standing vacancies will have been filled by the 24th instant.(c) Stocks.The Stock Returns for the month of March are not yet complete for all divisionsj    but a comparison of those which have been received with tho corresponding returns for January and February shows on the whole an improvement in the position. It is estimated that on 31st March there were,  in the various stages of distribution, seven weeks&apos;  supply of wheat and flour in the country.(d) Trade Oo-operation.Reports from the Divisions indicate that the helpful attitude of trade organisations commented upon in the last report is fully maintained.     Representatives of the various trades have been freely consulted, and the Associations concerned are in many cases taking active steps to work out in advance  schemes for dealing with distribution problems in an emergency.The emergency scheme for the distribution of milk in the metropolitan area has, however, given considerable trouble and has been the subject of protracted discussion by the Advisory Trade Committees appointed for the purpose.      The  scheme is approaching completion but it is unlikely that successful
-8-720operation Can be guaranteed without financial assistance from the Government.      This is at present the subject of negotiation.;The distribution of flour in London and the Home Counties has engaged the attention of a special sub-committee appointed by the Ministry of Transport, which has submitted an interim report.      A representative of the London Millers is being added to the Committee to co-operate in the completion of the Scheme.7. PRESERVATION OF ORDER.Full instructions have been issued to the Police regarding certain arrangements referred to in previous reports, including the safeguarding of explosives, the safeguarding of arms, ammunition etc., and vulnerable points, the strengthening of the Police Forces, etc.      The measures for the protection of convoys have been carried a stage further by Conferences with Liaison Officers and individual Chief Constables;    and District Conferences, attended by a representative of the Home Office, are being held in the most important areas, where it is hoped to complete the police arrangements,  so far as they can be worked out in advance.      Arrangements have also been made with the Military Authorities to hold detachments of troops available to assist the police at the main centres in the protection of convoys, as well as vulnerable points, if occasion requires.8.  SCOTLAND.The Organisation for which the Secretary for Scotland is responsible has been further developed since the date of the last Report.      It is intended that the Lord Advocate should take charge of the Scottish Office Emergency Headquarters; in Edinburgh during an emergency.     A Conference between tho Scottish Office, the Naval and Military Authorities and the District Commissioners who are to have charge of the Districts into which Scotland will be divided for emergency purposes was held in Edinburgh on 15th April.      Arrangements were adjustod
for close liaison between the Scottish Office and the Naval and Military Authorities during an emergency.      The particular matters discussed included arrangements for  (l) concentration of stocks of explosives:    (2)  concentration of arms belonging to the territorial army, civilian rifle clubs, etc.:    (3) assistance in the protection of vulnerable points:    (4) Naval and Military aid in support of the civil forces.     The Scottish Office have issued to Chief Constables Circulars dealing with the questions numbered (l) and  (2) and also with the question of the strengthening of Police Forces.      Chief Constables have been informed that a Circular authorising various measures for strengthening their forces which was issued on 28th July last may be regarded as still holding good.In the five Districts into which Scotland is dividend for this purpose the District Commissioners have been actively developing their arrangements by establishing co-operation and liaison with the railway, coal and shipping authorities, the General Post Office and other Departments concerned. Arrangements have also been made so far. as practicable for co-operation with Local Authorities and for adjustment of the respective spheres of responsibility.      Investigation into the condition of food stocks is also being pushed forward.Generally speaking, the Organisation, both centrally and in the Districts, seems to be almost as complete as it is possible to make it at this stage.W.
