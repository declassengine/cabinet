BisjiOCUumT is mis property of kis. britamnio,majesty&apos;s^govMaiMT).OABIHETo fA (36) &quot; /go VERrTMEKT lauds and buildings *Memorandum by the First Oomiuissloner ni of Works .I have carefully considered the proposal Bet forth in the note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, CePol03(86), covering a Memorandum by the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.The extent to which another body could, -without serious detriment to administrative convenience, function on behalf of my Department in negotiating for the acquisition or disposal of lands and buildings is set out in the Scheme prepared two years ago by the Inter-departmental Committee to which the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury refersa    The amount of work which would be trans -ferred from my Department under that Scheme is still approximately the same, the estimate cf staff engaged upon the work being:-(a) Sales and purchasesi-London.    Half of the time of one man (spread over 5 men).Provinces.    The time of one and a half Assistant Architects and Surveyors spread over the whole country (spread over 80 men in 6 branches).(b) Hirings and lettings/Dver 21 years a very small proportion of the time of one man (spread over 31 men).It would thus be impossible to transfer any individual Officer with the work, and it appears to me that economies will only be effected if the Staff of the Land Valuation Department are able to secure better bargains than oould be obtained by my Staff. I am very doubtful of their abi lity to do so, and. in any case the field for their efforts is not wide.    If the Land Valuation Department will require additional staff to undertake the agency work suggested for my Department, I am definitely of opinion that the arrangement will be more costly.P.fffioe of Works. ^ April, 1936..
