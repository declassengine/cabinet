SAFEGUARDING OP INDUSTRIES. Report of the Enamelled Hollow-ware Committee.To The Risiht HonourableSir Philip Cuuliffe Lister, L.B.E., M.C., M.P., President of the Board of Trade.Sir,1.     On November 2nd, 1925, we were appointed to enquire into and report upon an Application made by the Enamelled Hollow-ware Section of the Wrought Hollow-ware Trade Employers&apos; Association for the imposition of a duty upon imported enamelled hollow-ware.2.      The Enquiry opened on 6th January last and ten Public Meetings have been held.   Evidence has been heard from five witnesses on behalf of the Association, and from five witnesses in opposition to the Application.    In addition, certain evidence of a confidential nature which was heard in camera was submitted by witnesses for both parties; and at the invitation of the Committee three large buskers of enamelled hollow-ware for retail sale gave evidence, which was also heard in camera.3.     Both sides were represented by Counsel, Mr. CF. Entwiatle appearing on behalf of the Applicants, and Mr. N,L.Macaskie and Mr. J.B. Herbert on behalf of Importers and merchants who constituted the Opposition.4.     At the commencement of the enquiry it was stated that the Application was not intended to cover Cast enamelled hollow-ware, and we have,, therefore, confined ourselves to that part of the industry concerned with the manufacture of wrought enamelled hollow-ware.5.      The Enamelled Section of the Wrought Hollow-ware Trade Employers&apos; Association comprises 13 firms engaged in the manufacture of enamelled hollow-ware in the United Kingdom,
the total number of such manufacturers being 18,    The applicants have submitted evidence and figures relating to production for certain firms, who it was stated represented approximately 55 per cent, of the whole trade and it is on the basis of these figures that the estimates of total production were given us.    r&apos;e were informed by the Applicants that figures of employment for the years 1913 and 1920-1924 were not available and we were asked to base our considerations upon a figure of 3,755, the number stated to be directly employed in the industry in 1925, and upon an assumption that employment varied directly with the tonnage production in the Industry.   As an indication of the number employed in 1920 an estimate based on an alleged output of 3-V3rd tons per head per annum was submitted.6.     ^e beg to report as follows with regard to theinstructions in the W-ite Paper (Cmd. 2327).-(1)  &apos;gfcether the applicant industry is by reason of the volume of employment engaged&quot;*Tn the production of/the goods to^hich the application relates or by reason of the nature of the poods produced an industry of substantial importance.7,     We are of opinion that the enamelled hollow--:are industry may be regarded as of substantial importance both in respectof the goods involved therein and the volume of employmentengaged, and it may be noted that 95 per cent, of the rawmaterial used therein is produced in this country.(2) Whether foreign goods of the class or description to ^hich the application relates are being imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in abnormal quantities.8,     For the proper adjudication of this section of theWhite Paper it has not been easy to find truly normal periods for comparison.    The pre-war trade of sai  1910 to 1913inclusive shows consistent importations from several countries, averaging for those four years 12,614 tons in allper annum.   The only figure for borne production submitted
the total number of such manufacturers being 18,    The applicants have submitted evidence and figures relating to production for certain firms, who it was stated represented approximately 55 per cent, of the whole trade and it is on the basis of these figures that the estimates of total production were given us,    r% were Informed by the Applicants that figures of employment for the years 1913 and 1920-1924 were not* available and we were asked to base our considerations upon a figure of 3,755, the number stated to be directly employed in the industry in 1925, and upon an assumption that employment varied directly with the tonnage production in the industry.   As an indication of the number employed In 1920 an estimate based on an alleged output of 3&quot;V3rd tons per head per annum was submitted.6,     we beg to report as follows with regard to theinstructions in the w^ite Paper (Omd, 2327) :-(1) whether the applicant industry is by reason of the volume of employment enraged In &quot;Ebe production of the goods to which the application relates or by reason of the nature of the goods produced an industry of substantial importance.7.     We are of opinion that the enamelled hollow--are industry may be regarded as of substantial importance both in respectof the goods involved therein and the volume of employmentengaged, and it may be noted that 95 per cent, of the rawmaterial used therein is produced in this country.(2) Whether foreign goods of the class or description to which the application relates are being, imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in^abnormal quantities.8,     For the proper adjudication of this section of theWhite Paper it has not been easy to find truly normal periods for comparison.    The pre-war trade of sa^ 1910 to 1913inclusive shows consistent importations from several countries, averaging for those four years 12,614 tons In allper annum.    The only figure for home production submitted
us for that period was one of 7,000 tons for the year 1913. During, the War importation naturally dwindled to a negligible quantity and the home factories becoming sheltered from competition, increased their outputs and also their premises and plant very considerably.    Thus we find in 1920, the first post-war year for which figures were submitted us, the home production is stated by the Applicants to have risen to slightly over 15,000 tons, while importations were only 3,643 tons.    The year 1920, was, however, in many respects exceptional and ir. most trades certainly not a normal one   either at home or on the Continent.    The years 1923 and 1924, dvr ing which a British duty against German importations prevailed, do not seem years either on which to base a fair comparison.   We prefer, therefore, to consider the years 1921 and 1922, whether separately or together, as forming a truer basis for comparison, although 1922 contains four months of the &quot;German duty&quot; period. 9.     The Table given in the Appendix shows the retained imports and the home production for 1913 and 1920 to 1925.In 1921 the net tonnage retained in this country was 13,047, of which 7,634 was imported material, representing 59 per cent, the corresponding figure for 1922 being 51 per cent, the average for the two years becomes 55 per cent. In 1925,. 14,206 tons were retained here for home consumption, of which 7,820 tons were imported material, the percentage of imported material being 55 per cent.Another aspect Is the proportion of the imported material to the home production.     In this case the percentage, which pre-war was close on 200 per cent, for the year 1921 is 107 per cent, and for the year 1922, 86 per cent, the average for the two years being 96,5 per cent. In 1925 this percentage becomes 83 per cent,by reference to the appended table it will be observed that whereas in 1920 of the home production of 15,255 tons
3,355 tons were exported, or 22 per cent., In the year 1925,     mmof a total production of 9,480 tons, 3,094 tons were exported or 33 per cent, leaving 78 per cent, as compared witto 67 per cent, for home consumption in the years 1920 and 1925 respectively.Total Home Production.

It appears from evidence we have received that trade inthis class of goods can be sub-divided into three distinctclasses.   Firstly,  there is the high-class speciality ware,both British and foreign, which has created a demand for itself; secondly, the good   average ware made by the morereputable firms on the Continent and by the greater part ofthe English firms; and tbirdly, a lower grade ware and aquality known as &quot;&quot;seconds&quot;.

3,355 tons were exported, or 22 per cent., in the year 1925. of a total production of 9,480 tons, 3,094 tons were exported or 33 per cent, leaving 78 per cent, as compared with 67 per cent, for home consumption in the years 1920 and 1925 respec tively.ProductionTons.     i       %	7,000	10015,255	1007,150	1009,966	10010,600	10010,567	1009,480	100Exports of -Hnmp......Produce.,,Tons .%Home ProduceTons.%913. 92 0, 921. 922. 923. 924. 92 5.2,484 3,355 1,737 1,884 3,565 2,749 3,09435 22 24 19 34 26 334,516 11,900 5,413 8,082 7,035 7,818 6,38665 78 76 81 66 74 67while re-exports of imported goods are almost negligible throughout it may also be noted from the table in the Appendix that the percentages of retained imports to retained home production for the two years 1921-1922 and for 19&amp;5 are very similar, viz., 123 per cent, and 122 per cent. 10.     In the light of these figures we cannot consider that a situation exists such as is defined in this section of our &quot;instructions&quot;, and therefore the applicants  claim in that respect fails to be established.i(3) Whether thei foreign poods so imported are being sold or offered for sale in the United Kin;-dom at prices which are below the&apos; prices at which similar goods can b&quot;e profitably manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom.11.     It appears from evidence we have received that trade in fthis class of goods can be sub-divided into three distinctclasses.   Firstly,  there is the high-class speciality ware,both British and foreign, which has created a demand for itself; secondly, the good   average ware made by the morereputable firms on the Continent and by the greater part ofthe English firms; and thirdly, a lower grade ware and aquality known as ^seoonds&quot;.    During the course of manufacture
a number of articles develop minor faults and on finalexamination are not considered to be up to the generalstandard of the firm&apos;s goods and although the cost ofmanufacture of these &quot;seconds&quot; is the same as that for first quality goods, the selling price obtainable for such goods is, of course, much lower.    Ignoring the specialityware, with regard to which there is but little competition,and also the very cheap lines referred to we have reason to believe that in the case of goods importedthrough merchants who either have the sole agency forforeign works or who deal practically exclusively withforeign made goods, the prices received by the foreignmanufacturer are below those of profitable manufacture in this country.     However, the evidence of retail housesgiven us independently and in camera clearly established that from their knowledge of both Continental and homemanufactures there is very little discrepancy in price forthe various ranges of articles mostly in demand,(4) Whether, by reason of the severity and extent of such competition, employment in &apos;the manufacture or production of such goods&quot;&quot; in&quot; the/United Kinpdom is being, or is likely to be seriously affected.12,    Evidence both on employment and unemployment overa series of years was not complete or very satisfying.The number of persons employed in the industry in 1925was stated to be 3,755 a figure which may be comparedwith one of 4,575 which was submitted as an estimate ofthe number employed in the boom year of 1920.(5) Whether such exceptional competition comes largely from countries where &quot;the conditions^ are so &apos; different &quot;from those in this country as- to render the competition unfair..13,   We received no evidence that ^a) depreciation incurrencies or (b) subsidies exist sufficiently- to render
the present competition unfair.   As regards &quot;artificialadvantages&quot; it should be borne in mind that Tariffs are inoperation abroad the effect of which is to support the home market of the country concerned and might be regarded as an artificial advantage to that country&apos;s export trade.   Asregards (c) we are of opinion from the evidence thatremuneration for labour In most of the competing countries is slightly below that ruling here, and also that hours worked in Continental factories are rather in excess ofthose current in England.(6) ^whether the applicant industry is being carried on in the united Kingdom with reasonable efficiency? and economy,14,     The Applicants provided limited evidence on thesubject of efficiency and economy relating only to 4 or 5firms but such evidence established a very fair measure of efficiency and economy in existence.     We formed theopinion this could not be said of the Trade as a whole andthat closer co-operation and mutual exchange of viewswould be beneficial to the Indus try both technically andcommercially,(7) Whether the imposition of a duty on goods of the class or description in question would exert a seriously adverse effect on employment In any other industry, being an industry using gooqs of that class or description in production,15.     The articles with which our enquiry has been concerned are finished articles and in the. main purchasedand used by the general public.    We have had no evidenceof any other Industry requiring or using, these goods inthe production of their own articles,

DAVENPORT.Chairman,(Signed)  A.W. KIRKALDY. (Signed)  I.J. HAYWARD.xSubject to the attached reservation,(Signed) W.J, GALLEY. Secretary.31st March,  1926.Reservation.1. With regard to Section 2 of the White Paper, I feel that it has not been possible to find truly normal periods for comparison for the following reasons:-
During the war as the result of the absence of supplies from foreign countries and the demand for war services, the conditions and dimensions of the industry were completely altered and its output very considerably increased. It would, therefore, appear to be unfair to compare post-war conditions with. pre--war conditions.   The post-war period shows that the year I(j20 was a boom year, the year 1921 was a slump year, the yoars 1922 and 1923 were years of depression, the years 1923 and 1924 were years of safeguardingj thus noae of these can be considered normal.    The table of figures in the Appendix shows what occurred during this period. Whilst there was \ safeguarding, imports from Germany fell approximately 3,000 tons.    For the year 1925 - the first full year after the period of safeguarding ended - foreign imports increased 2,064 tons, whilst home production fell off by just over 1,000 tons.    There was, however, an increase in the export of home production, and but for this the amount of home production required for the home market would have been very small, i,e., approximately 6,400 tons.    This shows that the home manufacturers have suffered in the home market since the safeguarding was suspended.The above facts, are on the whole, favourable to the application.2,     With regard to Section 3, the evidence in camera of the buyers of three retail firms was mainly as to supplies in London.    These firms purchase from 75?  to 90$ English goods, the small balance being mainly special lines.   But statistics show that the foreigner supplies over 50^ of our
representative.   Buyers of English houses, dealing moreextensively in foreign goods did not accept our invitation to give evidence as to the prices at which they buy.   but from merchants who either have the sole agency for foreignworks or who deal exclusively in foreign made goods, somefacts were elicited which should be known.The members of the Committee were not agreed as to whatis meant by the wording of the third point in the Paper, viz.,&quot;Whether the foreign goods so imported are being sold or offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices which are below the prices at which similar goods can be profitably manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom&quot;.Does this mean (i)  the price charged by the shop to the c onsumeror (ii)      h &quot;        &quot;       &quot;     &quot; merchant tothe retaileror (iii)    &quot; &quot; &quot;       &quot; manufacturerto the im-porting merchant.In my opinion the determining factor as to the import of these goods is the price at which the importing mrrchant can purchase from the foreign manufacturer a price which is comparable with the prices of the English manufacturers to the merchants - other prices being less comparable or altogether non-comparable,    It is the low prices quoted to foreign importers which account for the fact that whereas the evidence of three buyers gave a figure of 75^ to 90% for their purchases of English made goods, statistics prove that we consume upwards of 50% foreign made goods.  -The foreign importers compete successfully in supplying the ordinary ironmonger shops throughout the country, because they are able to buy at a considerable advantage.    There is an Ingenious policy of flexible discounts thanks to which the
foreign importer enjoys special advantages as to price. These prices are very difficult to determine.    But the cross examination of one of the foreign importers made the matter fairly clear,   he refused to answer some questions, and he denied that it is possible to give the prices of imported articles; finally he did exhibit some selected Invoices, but these were of doubtful value as evidence.   It was, however, elicited that these flexible discounts can amount to as much as 15% in addition to the ruling discounts.    The foreign Associations are price fixing Associations, but these additional discounts are utilised to make sure of an entry into our markets.   It should toe noted that the Association of our manufacturers is not a price fixing body.    The evidence shows that there is considerable competition between the members of the English Association, so that from this point of view the industry is in a healthy condition and is not applying for safeguarding in order to exploit the consumer, 3.     In addition to the existence of tariffs mentioned in paragraph 13, the practice of varying discounts enables the foreign manufacturer to make a special price to the extent of an additional 15% lo obtain orders in the Enplish market. As regards conditions of labour, I formed the opinion that the -&apos;or!inf; hours per week in Germany, our chief competitor, are longer than those worked in this country. 4.     I do not agree that the suggestions contained in paragraph 14 are specially applicablg to this industry,(Signed)  A.YV. KIRMLDY.
