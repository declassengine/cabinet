REPORT 01  A MATING between the Prime Minister the Mining Association and the Miners&apos; Federation ox Great dritain held at Montagu House on Pridav  3rd April, 19 6, at 11 a.m.PRIME l;;ir.I3T3R:      I have very very few words to say to you this morning.       I have come here, not as representing the mine owners or the miners, but as representing the country. The country is a very much bigger thing than either, and I-do-want everyone to bear that in mind.     There is one other thing. Whether we have a stoppage or not, we have still got to nego-tiate together at some time, but negotiations after a stoppage are not necessarily easier than they are before, and everyone at such a time 1b certainly in a worse position pecuniarily. I think those are both important things to remember,I was very sorry to see that you reached another deadlock yesterday.     I have read the account, of course,  of what happened, but I think it much better)  in my capacity as head of the State, that I should hear myself,  in the presence of all the representatives, tho two sides state the reasons for that deadlock, and I am going to ask Mr. Evan Y/illiams and Hr.Herbert Smith each to make the statement from their own point of view why they consider the deadlock occurred yesterday.     I will ask each side to listen quietly to the other, because I do not propose to have any discussion on it this morning.      I want to know the reasons for my own information, and when I have heard what has been said I may have some observations to make. Mr. Evan Williams,  if you will be good enough to tell me, in the presence of this gather lug, exactly why, in your view, the negotiations yesterday broke down, I shall be very much obliged to you.MR . LVAIT WILLIAMS :      I do not know whether you would wish any of the ground that was covered before yesterday to be traversed again to indicate what the position was before we met?PRIME MINISTER:      I will leave it entirely to you to put the case as you think best,
I1R. EVA1T WILLIALiS :      As you are aware,we have had severalmeetings, and at the last meeting we held before yesterday thepcsition we had arrived at was that we, as owners, had made it quite clear to the other side what our attitude was in regardto the recommendations of the Royal Commission, and what line we felt should be taken to proceed with the negotiations,bearing in mind v^hat those recommendations were.     We indi-cated quite plainly, witheut any ambiguity at all, that inour view there were two courses, both of which should befollowed.     The first was that a national agreement shouldbe discussed and considered and arrived at if possible, embodying the principles which (should govern the regulation of wages inthe country, and detdling as much as was necessary of themachinery and sther facters which would be applicable generallythroughout the country in carrying out the ascertainment of thewages on the principles which were laid down in the national aggreement.     Concurrently, or as near as possible to,this dis -cuss ion of the national position, we indicated that in ^urview the actual rates wf wages, &quot;both in respect of the minimumfeaturewage? that has been a of the last two agreements -when I say minimum wage I make it clear I am referring t-o the minimum percentage upon the basis rates which has been applied under the 1021 and 1624 agreements to the payment of wages in the country - that those minimum rates and the subsistence wages were matters to be dealt with in the districts them-selves, and that it was only in the districts that it was possible to give the necessary consideration to them, and we made it quite clea:r/that it was outside the power of the Central Committee of the Llining Association to deal with questions of that kind, and that therefore we wished that the District
I.IR. EVA1T WILLIAMS:      As you are aware,we have had severalmeetings, and at the last meeting we held before yesterday thepttsition we had arrived at was that we, as owners, had made it quite clear to the other side what our attitude was in regardto the recommendations of the Royal Commission, and what line we felt should be tadcen to proceed with the negotiations,hearing in mind wrhat those reoqmmendations were.     We indi-cated quite plainly, witheut any amhiguity at all, that inour view there were two courses, &quot;both of which should befollowed.     The first was that a national agreement shouldbe discussed and considered and arrived at if possible, embodying the principles which ahould govern the regulation of wages inthe country, and detailing as much as was necessary of themachinery and sther facters which would &quot;be applicable generallythroughout the country in carrying out the ascertainment of thewages on the principles which were laid down in the national aggreement.     Concurrently, or as near as possible to,this dis-cus3ion of the national position, we indicated that in ourview the actual rates of wages, &quot;both in respect of the minimumfeaturewage9 that has &quot;been a of the last two agreements -when I say minimum wage I make it clear I am referring t&apos;0 the miniinum percentage upon the basis rates which has been applied under the 1021 and 1P24 agreements to the payment of wages  in the country - that those minimum rates and the subsistence wages were matters to be dealt with in the districts them-selvesj and that it was only in the districts that it was possible to give the necessary consideration to them, and we made it quite clear^hat it was outside the power of the Central Committee of the Llining Association to deal with questions  of that kind, and that therefore we wished that the District
Associations on both sides should me*&apos;et as  early as possible to proceed with the discussion of these questions in their Districts. The Miners Federation had sent to us before the last meeting the resolution which had been arrived at at their conference, Which recommended to their districts that they should not accept any change in the hours of work, that they should insist upon a national uniform minimum percentage throughout the country,and that that percentage should be the same as was payable at the present tiroe.     We were pressed to give^he offers of wages which the rwners were going to put to the men in the Districts. At that time the districts had not completed their considerationiof the matter, and we informed the Miners Federation that thatwas the position and that we were anxious to get back to the districts as soon as we could so that we might proceed,withthem if they accepted the invitations which were being sent.tc them to meet us in the Districts, or without them if they I did not wish to join with us in the consideration of this question,with the terms which each District felt it was possible for itto put up at the pits and on which work could be carried on ,after the end rf April.      That was done, and the Districts pro-ceeded to deal with the question on those lines.      In additiontr- that, we proceeded to draw up a proposal for a national aggreement on the lines&quot;that we had indicated to them were toi(be followed, and which were in accord, from our point of view,&apos;  &apos; iiwith the recommendations of the Royal Commission.      I should&apos; &apos; I   ifhave added that in indicating that the minimum rates of the &apos;):Districts should be considered in the Districts by the Districtsthemselves , we made it quite clear that we accepted the recom- j.mendation of the Royal Commission that when proposals had bfeenarrived at in the Districts they should be submitted to the3 I &apos;       iIi.
national body for their approval; and made it clear that the approval of the national body would not be qualified in any way at all.     I ought to have made that quite plain.       We proceeded to draw up the terms, of an agreement to be made between the Mining Association and the Miners Federation of Great Britain on a national basis, and we incorporated in that the modifications which had been suggested by the Commission on certain points, and I think we may claim that we followed closely the recommendations of the Commission in regard ts it.     We sent that to the Miners Federation to give them time te consider it before they met ua at a joint meeting to whioh we invited them, and which was held yesterday.     We-hoped that at the joint meeting we might be able to make some progress in preparing an agreement which must be arrived at at some time or ether, because to the extent that I have indicated we were both tt the opinion that national agree-ments were necessary, the difference between ua being, of course, in regard te the scope ef the agreement rather than as to tho necessity for the existence of an agreement.   As I said, we hoped to be able te make seme progress in discussing the terms of the agreement in so far as it was of a national character, but the discussion wandered rather from the point; in fact, I may say that we never got to a discussion of a single word of the agreement because we were led to consider District   figures, not       the actual figures but certain questions were asked by the Miners Federation as ts what had been done in the Districts in regard to certain particular items of payment^ and explanations In general were given upon these pointer, and the discussion proceeded on to really the fundamental issue which emerged - as it had emerged at every meeting that we have held - as to whether there should be a national minimum uniform
for the country ix  a wholo,whioh wo said sr^s; a matterabsolute impossibility in view of the enormous variations in theabilities of the various Districts, which was contrary to the findings of the Royal Commission itself, and one which we couldnot entertain for one moment.     Further than that, it was madequite clear that the view of the Miners Federation was thatthat national minimum should be the same as        has beenapplicable under the 1924 agreement, and which has been con-tinued as far as the wages of the workmen are concerned sincethe termination of that agreement last July through thesubsidy granted by the Government.     There is no doubt whatever,there can be no doubt, as may be seen from the notes of themeeting, that the deadlock that we arrived at was clearly onthat fundamental issue, aa tc the nature of the minimum, asto its &quot;being uniform nationally, of the same magnitude in everyDistrict in the country, and that the amount of the minimumshould not be reduced from that which is being paid at thepresent monent.There was, therefore, no ground upon which any further dis-cussion could take place cn those two particular points.     Itwas obvious that as far as the Miners Federation were concerned,they were tied by resolutions of their conference, confirmed,I believe, as has &quot;been reported, oy every District in thecountry, and when their attitude was determined in that way and was so definite in its character, was so fundamentallyholdopposed to the views which we upon these two vitalquestions, and, I may say, also, as I have said before,opposed to the recommendations of the Commission itself, it was very evident that further discussion between us was imposai-ble, and although we suggested we might proceed to the considera-tion of the document which we had handed to them, embodying the terms of the national agreement, the Miners Federation declined tosi and the meeting thereupon terminated.5
In the oourse of the discussion   we were asked for thefigures which had been put up, which, had been prepared bythe districts ..nd ve said at once that euoh informationas had been sent to us from the districts for aurinformation as        Central Committee would be sent to themfor their information, but we were not in a position toeiscuss any of the district figures with them at all.   Weadmitted that in the districts which were subject inparticular to foreign competition, competition from countries whose hours of work were longer and whose wages were very muoh lower, on the present hours of work it is a matter of absolute:.,, impossibility for the industryother than one to provide a wage/which in some districts, I did notshrink from describing   as miserable.   I say again that isthe position; in those districts whioh have to    suffer from foreign competition on the present hours of work thereis bo possibility in those districts of providing a wagewhich is other than very low, but I indicated thatif an extension of hours could be agreed upon the wagepaying capacity   In thowe districts would be so improvedthat they would be able to offer a wage against whioh noreproach could be levelled, and that in some of the districtsoffers were being made on the basis of increased hourswhich showed quite clearly what the owners felt the capacityof the industry would be increased to if the hours ofwork were longer, but as it was, the usages that werVin the poor&quot; districts meant that offered/ the whole of the money in the industryawas thrown into wages and no profit at all retained by the ooalcwners themselves. On the basis of the offers, the wages that would be paid in this country would still be higher than thftse paid in the countries that compete with us and which work longer hours for those wages,
reelThe only/salvation of the industry lies in a longer working day which would increase the amount of money which will go into the industry and will enable the wages to he paid by the industry to be correspondingly increased.   Without that   we do not ses/that it is possible to carry on our export trade from this country, and, indeed, a large proportion of the inland trade to the gr&amp;at Goal consuming industries which are themselves faced with foreign competition except on terms which must be very low as far as the wages t&amp; be paid are concerned^ On the offers v?hi.o^.are being made    it is quite clear that a very large proportion of the output of the coalfieldswould he produced at a loss,  a large numbsr of the collieryat. a losscon-parries would be wording, if -they work at ai^, and it is clear that seme of them, to what extent it is impossible to cay, would not be able to start their collieries even on the terms that were being offered by the owners.I do not know that I have anything further to say at the moment unless there is some point you would like me to make clear.PRIME MUJIS2EB:    I think the explanation you   , have given is- very lucid and I think 1 understand it.     How &apos;Mr. Smith,, will you be good enough to tell us from your point cf view whet you consider the cause of the breakdown of the negotiations yesterday.M2. HERBERT SMITH:     Mr. prime Minister, Mr. Evan Williams tells you our history before I get up.      I always like the man getting up first to say his say and I can then say mine.    He has told you the history.      I have to repeat it probably ia another way and probably as far as I can from statements that have brought    about
the deadlock.     The first thing I have always realised in negotiations is that when one starts to threaten the other man he can expeot to get a threat back.     That is the first thing.     We met the owners on April 13th and these are the words we get from a gentleman like Mr. Evan Williams, who you would not think would use such wirds:&quot;You will have to go there (the districts) some day&quot;, broke down on the first principle, that the man when he works ought to ha^e a respeotable wags.     That, is not offered to us by the owners,     That is the first thing. You said you spoke for the nation,     I realise your position.     We speak f^r a million or more men who have had conditions put down for them to work under that we oannot and would nob attempt to recommend them to consider for one moment.     It would be impossible to da it.     How you have been told that we broke down on the conditions that were set out by the Commission.     The marvellous thing is that Mr. Evan Williams tells us n*w in April 1926 that they have followed out the lines of the Report of the Commission, Well the exact propositions that are put before us now were put before us in July 192^ except they are slightly worse now than what they wore then,     Three parts of the language used now was used in 1925&quot;, and I want te suggest that they have not folloY/ed the suggestions of the Commission, and even if you decide, as probably you may think in your wisdom you ought to do, that it is district agreements we have tn go back to, we want to be absolutely as straight and hone31 v/ith you as we intend being outside.   We do not intend going back to discuss district negotiations.   We intend,  if the minimum is fixed, it shall be fixed as a national minimum to operate as suoh.     Their suggested agreement
would take us straightway hack to Districts.      There is absolutely no possibility of discussing it with the idea of going back to district agreements and district varying minima,,     Everybody will admit, even mr Evan Williams tells us he had to use the words wretohed wages, miserable wages0     He also goes on to tell you if we aocept longer hours that the offer they can make us, would be an offer that no reproach could be levelled at. Well they are suggesting a wage which even with longer hours would take us in many districts thirty par cent below the cost of living so If that cannot have reproaoh levelled against it I do not know what can.     It is perfectly true that we have from time to time said, and we mean what we say, that we intend honestly and faithfully to carry out the Mines Act cf seven hours from last man going down to first man coming up.     There are exceptions in that Act,,     We are told by our friends that they suggest we go back to eight hours because we oannot compete with other countries.     I have been looking at two or three speeches that have been made by British coalowners in Germany when they were talking to the miner?) in Germany where they have their interests,  and I followed a similar speech that was made in England, and I found it was simply trying to play one against the other.     It is not worth anything as far as we are concerned.      We say whichever country a workman is -crking in he should receive a living wage.      They go on to say we broke down, on the question of a national minimum.     We met you last week.   You did not commit yourself at all to us.     You-v-S-......, ,......-------:---......-----------.....-----......-.-.....------________,_____
heard what we had to say. You told us,  and rightly too,that you were then    going to consult the coal wner sandwe were  to be in readiness and we rather think, usinga Yorkshire phrase,   that we have been sidetracked. We areonly imagining this,, The owners came to    see you onWednesday and said to you well you need not bother anythingfurther now, we have fixed up a meeting with the minerstomorrow. That is what I am inferring because we metexaatly   the  same coalowners with the same statements thatwe met before we came to see you0 Exactly  the samep oeiticn. They have not gone a single item away from itan3.       they put words on paperWh.i0k all        - imply. and district agreements,/district minima, and to  attempt todiscuss one clause or another clause would be to say weetc.aooept  the principle of district minima/^   We are told and you were told and asked to believe it that coalowners nationally are not in a position because they have net the information at their hands to    discuss fixing up a nationalmiamum.    I want to put it and seriously too, after forty,thatyears1   experience in negotiations/there is more information in the coal trade today as to district by district than ever there was.    It has been brought about -largely by the 1921 agreement,and the figures both sideshave to accept t because they have been got cut by joint accountants; they have been prepared in order to decide from time to time the ascertainments and the wages that can be paid in the various districts.    Never before have we had these things at our fingers ends and  to tell us in 1926 that they have not the information that will help them to arrive at/ agreement , - well we do not like  to tell people they are not telling the truth,-  but they cannot step us fresd thinking., because we are satisfied that
information is there. But  this attack w.as notflr.it madein 1926. It was made in 1925 to force us &quot;back to districtagreements.    When you look at the varied wages from count;?to county and see the anomalies between miners in onedistrict and miners in another district, and day wageminers in one distridt and day wage miners In anotherdistrict,  there is no   room   for any   further anomalies,,I am hoping tfce time is not far distant when we shall   beable to level them   up because a man working In one countyshould get as much as a man working in another country ,butwe have not sought to get rid of these anomalies. All wehave tried to do    is.to present further anomalies.   Wego further and ask you kindly to look at what these ownershave put before us &apos;and to ask you whether the description our friend puts of miserable wages should net bo emphasisodAad put noro strongly. .    But that is not all.    It is a bigger dispute now than wages because they are attackingour customs that have been built up in districts for years.In Northumberland I think I am ri$it in saying, and [Durham,conditions have been in existence ever   since I can rememberand I went into IHifham in 1888 to work and they were there before I went,-as to house rent and coal and hours,and  I put it to you, Mr J? rime Minister,  that Durham miners and Northumberland . miners In days gone by tried to meetthe wishes of the coal owners because coal owners said weare prepared for you to work less hours if you will meetsooend and acur wishes and work more shifts,    They have now a/thirdshift in Durham and then there is the repair shift inaddition to that and now  they are trying to increase theirhours too. They are not saying we will relieve you   from the . ataxtra -aliiiftsr/ all,- but go on as you are now,  -in that respect,  but increase the hours.      So wo areattacked on hours and long customs that we have had Inlln
existence for years.    They-hare been attacked in South gales.-;on the percentages given them for the change from6 nyors to ?).   .  They say instead of 14.1$ it is going tohe &amp;jf0 In other districts they  say in regard to subsistence these mustwages th. t/depend.   on what we get as Government helpo Iam rather glad  that &quot;our friends have turned round  to thatGovernment help.   I think I am right in saying in Yorkshirew if this is not so, 1 will withdraw it at once - theminimum percentage, I am reading MrCPrime Minister fromcopies that Yorkshire sent out2-the minimum percentage onsubsistence allowances will only be paid on condition thatany continued subvention payment granted by the government shall be received in full by Yorkshire collieries on thesame basis as in all the districts. That is one of theconditions and I want it to be noticed in passing th j stha t /diTst ri o t tha t w it h subvent i on they got over 2/- a t on/^or^^the last three months that we have ascertainments for.   If anybody thinks    they can buy &apos;        r peace and see the owners getting that andthe miners to have a reduction in wages you are misunder-S&amp;an&amp;retraining ub entirely0   While we are eut for peace9 we are not out for peace at any price.   The conditions of peace are that at the pit we will do our best whether it is private enterprise or nationalisation, but the next thing is a &apos; respectable wage whioh we can litfe on.
I ought to say &quot;before leaving South Wales that agreement has been in existence far years;six shifts for five for thosewho work nights and afternoons.    They say th&amp;t has to goin South Wales *    They say further that if there is. asubsistence wage that wage shall only apply to married men.For. the married man in place of S/Ofd they offer him 6/8d.LIB. MVAH WILLIAMS: That is not cox-rect.MR, IhtlRHERT SMITH:    I am quoting from your ownpamphleto    It has been well drawn up.      It is the bestpropaganda pamphlet I have seen from your point of view and it is very useful for me,11R. EVAU WILLIAMS:    You are misquoting.MR, HERBERT SMITH:     It is given to every man inSouth Wales and bears your name and Edward LoA,,,.m    I dsnot know him.    It is dated 22nd April and also there is&apos; FoG-ibsOB,  Secretary&apos; on it,    It is Schedule A.MR. EVAN WILLIAMS:      If you read the schedule youwill find it is from 6/8d to 7/2d,MR. H.3RBERT SMITH:     How sir I say again that themen who are now getting 8/0-fd, in this circular it is theirsuggested that    /   subsistence wage shall be 6/8d in future. How we were told,-we have got speeches from the coal owners, -the Commission have it on record, that the men who wera on subsistence wages would be safeguarded in this business. This is how they are going to be safeguarded.    They have got to come down to a lower pay and in addition to that twenty-five per  cent, more men in that particular area wouldbe on a subsistence wage.     How, Mr.Prime Minister, while. .    &apos; :i&apos;&apos;^&apos;L.&apos;&apos;:a/w/:/a  \&apos;;   :: &apos; :      &apos;&apos;&apos;   i&apos;; :        v        .       \ -you represent the nation,  as I feaid before,we represent the
workmen and we speak with the workmen&apos;s voice, not for any-particular individual, because this  Committee believes that the workmen from time to time ought to he consolted because they are the people who have to suffer most and they are the people who have the first right to consider whether that suffering can be endured.    Now sir we have been open with you.    We have admitted, we admitted here, that unless something else is going to be done with this industry we have got to say to the Government   &apos;We have got to hang our harps upon you&apos; because we are not responsible, Tire take no responsibility for the chaotic condition we are in.     We say that in 1919 if that enquiryhad been followed up properly and if there had been thatowners1willingness from the / side, that there ought to have been,we should not have been talking now about extending hours,but of reducing hours.      Now sir we are told that we oughtto go back to our districts and discuss this.      Sir, weare open to discuss wages nationally.    We are open todiscuss an agreement nationally.     We are not open to anconsider /extension of hours.    I want that to be clearly understood,   so that we make no mistake here, because even with the extension of hours &quot;-all districtsinapart frpm one, would suffer a serious reduction/wagos^&amp; 1 S 0When I come to Scotland I find we/ come up against a 3nagThey suggest in Scotland we should go back to 1888 to find the basis of the wage. That isone of their suggestions.    That has been discussedbefore the Commission sat andwe thought it was not going to be a stumbling block that  weagainst settledshould come un/again beo&amp;use in 1921 we      /    it; in 1924settled then nsw*we    I       it,  that argument  came in/and here it is put in again/
Then the adult - in Scotland it used to ho 18, now they era&amp;ttemnting1 to raise, , . t/ tne age to 21.    Dow sir  sometimes we are told that the workmen are very rebellious -8th AD All iTIMJ 10:    Do you mean in respect ofsubsist enca wage., Mr . Smith?1IH, HHBB3SRT SMITH;    Yes,SIR ADAM iTIMIO;    I only wish to make it quite clear.MR. HERBERT SMITH.    I am talking now aboutsubsistence wage, but 1888 means more than subsistencewage,  the 1888 standard that they talk about has got to befound to cover all these wages whether subsistence or notoAnd they have raised the age from 18 to 21.They say &apos; able-bodied male workers&apos;, hereI do not think there would, be many/who would honestlyqualify as able-bodied if they were tested properly.     they say able-bodied male workers of xt twenty-one years and overarato receive a minimum wage of 5/3d per shi^t,with a subsistenceminimum of 9d. per shifib up to a gross daily wage cfto be/9d per shift,  at which no subsistenca addition is/paid*That is with regard to able-bodied male workers    Then we get the liwer paid men,   With regard to male workers undertwenty-one years of age and female workeru the present&quot;subsistence arrangement will be adjusted in relation toalsothe above proposals,  so that they have/got to submit to a redu ct ion cSIR ADAM SiMMO;:       We have never been away from the 1888 basis in Scotland in any agreement we have ever made.MR. EMHBERT SMITH:    I sat very attentively, Mr oPbime Minister,  and listened to my friend -SIR ADAM HTMMO:    I do not  think it is an unreasonable interruption.
O -5 f*MR. JrlJUQERT SMITH:    I ata reading from documentssupplied by the coal owner s a    I am riot responsible for this.If it is wrong and if you withdraw it,  I will hand it overto you at once.,    hew sir I want you to look at the collieryWinding   Fngj nemah;  I say that that man has a responsibilitythat ought to guarantee that he i s going to get some wagefor that responsibility, because in some of our shafts youat the same time and have forty men going down and forty men going up  some evengo as high as sixty down and sixty up at one time.    Howwhat is suggested in one county is--thin,  that this veryresponsible man who has now ll/6c6, under their proposalshall come down to 8/5051,  3/l029 reduction per d.ay.Then we get the loco engine driver.    They have two grades in this particular county.    They have some at 7/lOg-d andsome at 8/11.10.    They suggest that the man at 7/lO-g-dcomes back to 5/9o07 or 2/1.43 reduction per day.    Thenanother man that  I look upon as an important man,  that isyour deputy.    I would be glad to see the deputy independentandeither of owners or of workmen./ that he should go down and make a report and say  &apos;That is my report and I do not care whether it interferes with the owners or the workmen, they have nothing to do with me.1   He has at the present time 11/6.6,    They suggest reducing him to 8/5.31,  3/1.29 per;lay reduction,  and so we go on.How sir these are figures supplied by thoowners and not by the Miners Federation.   We have got thosefigures I expect as a favour because we were told yesterdaythem,they were not prepared to discuss   /    we had got t o go backthem;to our districts and discuss    /    we were told they had not
inform at i on from tiiem all; they had tried to get it, and asa special privilege to us,  for which we thank them, we were supplied with this yesterday afternoon0   We are informed byproposalsa letter this morning that these      j      were put up in South. -andWales,/ every man has been given one laststillnight and this morning-they/go on issuing them.   Now sir,we are anxious to settle, but we are just in this position that, while we are anxious to settle, we do not        : see any possibility of departing from the position of nationalnegotiations and a national minimum and we do not see any possibility of asking our men to submit to a reductionof the low wages they get at the present time.figuresI do not know whether I had better go through the so/ Mr. Prime minister a I think you have a copy of it?PRIMS MINISTER:    Yes.    I do not think it is necessary to go through it because what I wanted to get at was the cause of the breakdown.    I think you have put that as clearly from your point of view as Mr.Williams has put it from his.MR, HERBERT SMITH:      I am sorry to say I have not taken the lowest district.    If you look at Bristol, the Forest of Dean and Somerset, they have got to work and live by excitement; it will not be wages they will get,  it will be excitement.PRIME MINISTER:    I am very much obliged to Mr.Williams and Mr,Smith for the statements they have he.en-made.    They have been perfeotly lucid and I think it ia quite plain that at the moment you have tied yourselves up into a pretty tight knot f   What I have got to try and dD is to get that knot untied or cut or something.    Now from my point of view it is perfectly impossible in an assembly of
this size to make any steps towards solving that knot and I am going to ask eacja side if they will be good enough to retire and select a sri-.aH number who will come and talk with me,     I am not particular as to the number, provided it is small enough to get to business0    I do not mind whether it is anything from half a dozen to ten on each side0     I daresay you can agree that between you,     I should be very glad if these small bodies of representatives would keep themselves at my disposal and I shall be very glad ta begin this afternoon talking to them to see what way there is of getting over this first stile which ha3 presented itself today and possibly discuss to such a point that it may be necessary for us all to meet again0     That is the course I see clearly at the moment,      I hope both parties will consider it and will appoint a small body,     There is nothing more I v/ish to say at this moment except to thank you for coming and to thsivk the two gartlemen who have spoken for the very clear statements they have made,MR. HERBERT SMITH:    We thank you for listening t o us 9 ,PRIME MINISTER:    I shall be glad if you can do that within the next two hours.      After all we are working to a time limit.    Time is of value,    I should like very much to begin by three olclock this afternoon,MR. EVAN WILLIAMS:    We would be prepared to consider it now and let you know within five or ten minutes.MR. HERBERT SMITH:    We can do that too, sir,PRIME MINISTER:    Thank you very much.      Then it is possible I may ask one of the parties to meet me as early as 2030, if you can come to a decision quickly.(The proceedings then terminated.)10 Downing Street,  S,W.l0 23rd April, 1926.
