[261.THE WORKING OF THE LAW RELATING TO CLOSING HOURS FOR SHOPS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I wish to bring before my colleagues the question of instituting an inquiry into the working of the present provisions of the law relating to the early closing of shops. There are two sets of provisions at present in force - one permanent and one temporary.The permanent provisions are contained in the Shops Act of 1912.    They require every shop, with certain exceptions,  to be closed for a half holiday once a week,  and they give power to the local authorities to make Orders, with the consent of the occupiers of at least two-thirds of the shops affected, requiring the closing of shops on the other days of the week at an hour which must not be earlier than 7 o&apos;clock.    Certain classes of shops are exempted from the latter provision also. The procedure which is to be followed in relation to the Order is carefully iaid down in the Act and every Order has to be confirmed by the Home Secretary (in Scotland, by the Secretary for Scotland).    For the protection of the shopkeepers affected by a Closing Order the Act makes it illegal to carry on in a place not being a shop any business at a time when it would be unlawful to keep a shop open for the purpose of that class of business.The temporary provisions are contained in the Shops (Early Closing) Act,  1920, which continued the Order made under Defence of the Realm Regulations during the war requiring every shop, with certain exceptions,  to be closed not later than 8 p.m on days other than Saturday,  and 9 o&apos;clock on Saturday.    An amending Act was passed in 1921 by agreement between the interests affected, which extended the hours for the sale of
sweets,  chocolates, &amp;c. until 9.30 on weekdays other than Saturday, and 10 p.m. on Saturday.    The Order operates throughout the country and has effect as if it had been made under the Act of 1912.    The Act is renewed from year to year by the Expiring Laws Continuance Act.While a great deal had been done under the Shops Act of 1912 and under the Acts which preceded it,  and many Closing Orders had been made and confirmed by the Home Office, progress was nevertheless comparatively slow, and until the war-time Order was made, early closing was still the exception and not the rule in the retail trades of the country.    The war-time Order gave early closing all round,  subject to exceptions for certain businesses.As my colleagues will be aware,  a good deal of criticism has been directed against the continuance of the restrictions in the Order made under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, especially in so far as they affeot the purchase of tobacco and smoking requisites after the hour of 8 o&apos;clock in the evening. I am being continually asked dn the House why the public should not be able to buy what they want after 8 o&apos;clock,  and one is constantly seeing jibes in the Press on the same subject.    It is pointed out as particularly absurd that though cigarettes &amp;c. cannot be sold in a shop after 8 p.m.,  it Is legal to get them out of an automatic machine placed outside a shop, on a railway platform,  or the like.On the other hand,  it is perfectly certain that an enormous majority of the shopkeeping classes strongly support 8 o&apos;clock closing, and their views are voiced both by the National Chamber of Trade and other &quot;rade Associations and by the very influential Early Closing Association.    I would mention   in particular that the retail tobacconists are strong supporters of the maintenance of the existing Order.Early closing, as my colleagues will understand,  is not a matter which each shopkeeper is free to decide for himself. Except in the case of large shops, vdiich are too strongly established to be much afraid of this sort of competition,
W.J.H.ist March,  1923.L U43-5,l     individual shopkeepers do not feel able to close earlier unless their neighbours in the same trade do the same.    It has frequently happened,  even when a majority of the shopkeepers in a trade desire to closs earlier,  that they have been prevented from doing so by the refusal of a minority to fall into line.While there is little evidence before my Department to show-that the agitation against the continuance of the war-time Order is serious or widespread among the public,  it is very desirable to set this controversy at rest, and in any case the Government will have to decide before long whether the Act of 1920 is to be made permanent or not.    The Select Committee appointed by the House of Commons last year to consider the Expiring Laws Continuance Act recommended the following general principle, among others,  to be observed - &quot;Experimental legislation should, after a reasonable interval,  either be dropped or made permanent&quot;. When tlie Committee came to consider this particular Act,  it was represented to them that the Home Office wished the Act to be kept alive until they were able to deal with the whole matter,  and on that understanding its annual continuance was recommended for the time being.I would suggest that a Select Committee should now be appointed to inquire into the matter.    There does not appear to be any advantage in postponing the inquiry any longer,  and I think that a Select Committee would be preferable to a Departmental Committee. All previous inquiries into the question of early closing have been made by Select Committees of one or other of the two Houses of Parliament,  and the solution of the question, which really depends on the state of public feeling,   is peculiarly one for consideration by a parliamentary Committee.    If this proposal is adopted,  I would also recommend that the inquiry should include the working of the Early Closing provisions of the Act of 1912, in regard to which representations have been made from time to time and which may be capable of improvement.
