CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,11H15&apos; &apos;D OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AWN 10 MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT ),iflSECRET. COPY NO. ^ jr\ ----.-----                            CABINS T..^219^25) .NATIONALISATION OF ROYALTIES. .fiS2E?.?IS:ndum^ by the Lord Privy Seal.It may be for the convenience of the Cabinet if the apprehensions with which many of us regard the nationalisation of royalties are set out in order.The principal plank in the platform on which we succeeded at the late election was the opposition to Nationalisation. We held this conviction and we persuaded the  country to accept it because we were satisfied that national management is bad manage-ment - that is to say uneconomic management.      Any statement therefore that mining property should be free from the shackles of private ownership is meaningless to us.     It Is true that in the case of Coal private ownership must be limited as it is in the case of property in other resources of prime necessity.      I go further and am fully prepared to say that it must be even more strictly limited and controlled than It already is under the Act of 1923,      But to say that It ought to be transferred from private ownership to public ownership Is contrary to all our experience and all our arguments on the platform.      These considerations I need not say apply equally to a coalfield which Is being worked and to a coalfield which may be worked hereafter but has as yet no market value.The arguments which would justify us in abandoning this positionin respect of mining property must be very strong.      Let us examinewhat they are.      There are in &apos;Nationalisation, no direct economic advantages to the industry.     The Royalties will continue to be paid,hut henceforth to the State.      It is not even suggested that theState should be in a position to be of use by exercising the full control of ownership.      In the developed coalfields the leases willnol run out for over 30 years in the great majority of cases.      Inthe undeveloped coalfields of course ownership has no actual significance at all. -1-
In one sense there will be an economic advantage to the miners because the six million a year henceforth in the hands of the State will be an easy prey to agitation whenever the exigencies of an industrial struggle may require it.      It will be art opportunity for a sort of chronic STibsidy which will be demanded from the State wh en-eve r the miners are in financial difficulties, upon the precedent we set them last August.      But the opportunity of this  economic transaction cannot be held out as a merit.      On the contrary it would tend to make the demoralisation of the industry permanent.      And in order to secure it the State will have to draw upon its credit to the extent of 100 millions, with all&apos;the consequences which the Chancellor of the  Exchequer has explained.      So doubt an indirect economic effect might result if certain rights of control over the leased property were by legislation to be vested in the State as an incident of the transferred ownership, but these rights could equally well be entrusted to the State without any question of ownership,  as was shewn in the Memorandum of the President of the Board of Trade last year. Apart from this, except in a minority of cases, nothing would be done by this transfer of ownership to miners for the next 30 years.      All that would be accomplished would be to sacrifice a fundamental principle of Conservative policy and to deprive ft;tiro generations of the benefits of private enterprise.    Surely this would be a most wanton act. And observe how far the sacrifice of principle would carry us.      The coalfields are ,as it is proposed, to be bought by the State.      They are to he paid for at the market value.    The undeveloped coal-fields have in vast quantities no market value and.therefore.
thoy are to be acquired  for nothing.    That is the conclusion.    In other words a value which there is ne immediate prospect of realising - the value say of coal below the 4000 feet level - is deemed to belong to the community.    But this principle is capable of almost indefinite extension. Is the value of all property not immediately realisable to belong to the State?      Is the owner, for example,  of all land which has no building value to be by anticipation deprived by the State of any future building value it may hereafter acquire?      Or still further is the value to the owner of house property to be stereotyped at the price it would fetch at this moment and any future increment to pass to the State?       These are logically the extension of the selfsame prin-ciple.    And what is true of property in land is true of property in anything else - such as shares or Investments.    The State whenever It thinks fit is by a stroke of the pen to become the owner of every future increment beyond the present market value of anything.    These are hardly the polities of a Conservative Government.But if there is no direct economic advantage and if these far-reaching consequences from the admission, of the principle are to be apprehended what is there to be gained on the ether aide? So far as I know nothing is alleged on this side except the psychological effect.    It is said that if  the miners are told that the Royalties hitherto paid  to private individuals have been commuted for their full value
and the same royalties are hence-forth paid to the Stats they will he more ready to accept a reduction of wages. It may be so,  hut one would hardly believe that so absurd a position would survive twenty-four hours argument. They will sea the luxe of Northumberland and the Duke of Sutherland and the Marquess of Londonderry going off with the equivalent of the Royalties they have always been receiving and are likely to receive and they will he quite satisfied that they have made an excellent bargain although the mines continue to pay exactly the same sums as heretofore only to somebody else        One is driven to ask   &apos;If it would not be batter at any rate to examine whether so futile a position may genuinely be anticipated before we commit ourselves to a transaction which has for us such real disadvantages.      I suggest that we should begin by addressing ourselves - and asking the owners and miners to address themselves - to the immediate problem - Will they accept the only substantial remedy which the Commission recommend, namely the reduction of wag6S ?     If they will then we could promise forthwith to exact the five per cent contribution from the Soyalties for the sanitary necessities    or amenities of the mines, to establish the fit Committees which they ask for, to prescribe by law the profit-sharing which is recommended, to make the housing provision,  etc.,  etc.,      Irurther we could promise the necessary funds for the benefit of the miners who will become unemployed when the unprofitable pits
1^95are closed,  and personally I should &quot;be prepared to replace the bump at the beginning of May by a tapering-subsidy such as has been proposed.      Lastly   I need hardly repeat that we should be ready to develop the Act of 1923 so that no private rights or unreasonable exercise of ownership should interfere with the due development of the industry.      These are all practical steps which can be talcen forthwith.      But as to a socialist nostrum mischievous to us and of no essential importance to the men even on their own case for 30 years,  surely our decision on this can be postponed until at any rate the Government are assured that upon full consideration they in reality care for it.March lSth,  1926.
