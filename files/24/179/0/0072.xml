this aoopiroris iHBJBomigy ov his britakitio louresrys GOTOiaiEareu0 A B I g a g. Copy No. 5   5government Lands and Buildings. Mftroorandum by the Secretary for Scotland..I have considered tho proposal contained in the note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CoP. 103 (26)) that the Land Valuation Department of the Inland Revenue, should become responsible for the acquisition and m^^^lmen-t- of Government lands and buildings.     In Scotland the proposal atffeotB principally the work of the Board of Agriculture, whose view Is that owing to the special duties imposed upon them by statute in connection with the valuation, purchase and sale of properties any delegation of these duties to another Department would be inadvisable.     The Board havo for some time had an arrangement with the Valuation Office of the Inland Revenue under which they obtain information as to the valuations, areas, boundaries, etc., of properties proposed to be purchased under the Land Settlement (Scotland) Acta and they appreciate the advantages of the assistance which they derive from such an arrangement.      The Board are prepared to extend this co-operation with the Valuation Department so far as to place in the hands of that Department the negotiations for purchases and sales on Unas to be clearly defined.     At the Bame time the Board take tho view that all negotiations with the Treasury and all legal work In connection with the transfer of properties must remain under their control in view of their statutory responsibility for Land Settlement in Scotland.I concur In that view and am of opinion that the proposed taking over of the Board&apos;s functions iri these matters by the Inland Revenue organisation would make neithor for efficiency nor economy.     Such a ohange would, in my opinion, lead to additional correspondence, thus further complicating the transactions and slowing down the already Bomewhat lengthy procedure of land settlement.     The Board&apos;s Solicitor would still be necessary for other work and he would still find it necessary to review the deeds of conveyance.I am of opinion that the existing arrangement for co-operation between the two Departments as outlined above is the best solution of this question.(Sgd.)   JOHN GILMOUR.3.P.17X (26).Sottish Office.26th April, 1636.
