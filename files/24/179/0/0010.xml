HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.ET. 110(26).CABINET.TRADE OUTLOOK.MEMORANDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OP TBADE.I circulate the last monthly review of trade prospects which I have received from my Advisory Council.On the whole I think it is fair to say that the improvement is maintained and that we may look for further progress, if the coal question is satisfactorily disposed of.The volume of orders booked at the British Industries Fair bears out this view.   It is satisfactory to record that the decision of the Government to spend  25,000 on foreign publicity for the Pair contributed materially to its success; and that the Government&apos;s aotion has been keenly appreciated by the exhibitors.The improvement in trade is largely in what may be called oonsumers1 goods.    In the heavy trades, improvement is. much less marked; and they are particularly affected by uncertainty as to the coal issue.Cotton is bad.    But this, paradoxical as it may seem, 1b largely due to the low price of raw cotton.   Buyers of piece goods are short of stocks; but they aremiting for prices to fall still further.    Ab soon as the price begins to rise, they will almost certainly begin to buy.   There was a parallel instance before the war when in a great crop year the price fell away to 2d. or 3d.(Intld.) P. C-L.oard of Trade, 12th March,  1986.

COAL.SIB ADAM NIMMO said that the industry was at the moment overshadowed by the anticipation of the Commission*s report,  and was no doubt affected to some extent by this state of suspense; and on the whole the tone was probably not so good as it had been for &quot;the last two month.    But a great deal of stress should not be laid on what took place in February, because it was a kind of change-over month, and was always a fairly difficult one, even when trade was more normal.The outputs of coal from the beginning of the year up to the week ending 13th February were practically the Bame in amount ,as for the corresponding period in 1925. They were just a little, but not appreciably, better.   The shipments of coal in January of this year had been fully 200,000 tons down as compared with January 1925, but the marked feature there was the big fall in values.    There was a drop of nearly  900,000 in money,  and the drop in prioe was fully 3/- a ton, which, of course, was a very unfortunate feature from the point of view of the industry itself.    The number of persons employed in January this year had been just a little less than it was in 1925.    The peroentage of unemployed amongst insured persons in the industry was, therefore, up a little, and now amounted to fully 10%$ but of course,  this was a great deal better than in the middle part of 1925.IRON AND STEEL.MR. DORM AN stated that the pig iron market was a good deal quieter.    There was no inclination now to buy ahead as there had been a month ago, but stocks were reduced and that, of course, was a relief, - a financial relief, at any rate.    Three more furnaces were in operation at the beginning of February as compared with a month earlier.    The steel trade was very quiet and the demand for the home market rather smaller.    The requirements for export were limited and the prices very low,   British makers were meeting with great competition from the Continent and there was a grave lack of confidence owing to the uncertain position of the coal industry.      Shipbuilding, from the point of view of the iron and steel maker, was no better. OrderB for vessels had been placed, but most of the plates for those vessels were obtained from the Continent and all the plate mills in the country were running on very short time.There was a fall of about 3/6d. a ton in Continental prices for sheet bars and billets, owing chiefly to the depreciation of the franc    Sheet bars were now about  5 and billets about  4.15.6d*, c.i.f. English port.    The
IRON AND STEEL (contd.).black and the galvanised sheet trade was satisfactory, but there was not very much enquiry for forward delivery. The wire trade was very slack indeed and prices generally were downward; there had been a fall of about 10/- a ton in the last two or three months.    In constructional engineering there was very little alteration.    Most of the works were employed to about seventy to eighty per oent. of their oapacity,  and competition was very keen for such orders as were in the market.The condition of the iron and steel trade generally was not satisfactory and selling prices were often below cost of production.    It was becoming a very difficult matter to carry on and some makers were considering how far it would be good policy to carry on the heavy steel trade.    They were rather inclining to conoentrate more on the finished articles,  and stop the manufacture of the heavier iron and steel products and buy them from the Continent.STEEL.SIR ARTHUR balfour (Special Steels) said there was a considerable improvement in the home trade,  and although the orders were still small they were coming in in large numbers.    British makers were doing a very good trade with Canada, and were beginning to do some steel trade with the United States, in spite of their Tariff.    Trade with China was extraordinarily difficult.   There were numbers of Austrians and Germans trying to Imitate British trade marks at the present time.     So far, we had been able to fight them, and had made them pay damages and toe the line.Japanese trade was very decidedly better,  and improvement in the exchange was helping us.    Australia and New Zealand were continuing about the same - both being quite good.     As regards South Afrioa, Sheffield had secured some very big orders which previously had gone to -the&quot; Swedes for the big mining industry.The situation in Germany was very bad indeed,  so bad that it might perhaps affect the whole international trade situation.     They were actually selling back their raw materials which they had bought in this country.    They knew perfectly well that prices were rlBing and that eventually they would have to pay a higher price for the goods; but they were so tight for money that they were doing, this simply to raise money for present needB.    They could not get credit from the banks except at very high rates. They could sell the raw material but not the finished article, - and both Germans and Austrians, just before they stabilised their exchanges, had acquired stocks of raw materials all over the world.
NON-FERROUS METALS,SIR CECIL BUDD wrote as follows&quot;I cannot report any improvement in the Non-Ferrous Metals trades during the past month.   Galvanising remains busy and in some of the Brass and Copper industries there appears to be slightly more movement, due probably to an expectation that the price of Copper may rise if ^negotiations in America to reform the Export Association are successful. In all other directions, however, business has failed to recover from the quietude which set in at the end of last year and manufacturers are in need of new orders, the absence of which rather than foreign competition Is, I think, responsible for the actual state of affairs.&quot;SHIPBUILDING .SIR JAMES LITHGOW pointed out  that the shipbuilding industry had secured quite a   number of orders during the last six weeks, but this appeared to be due to people who needed specialised   vessels believing that prices were not likely to go down materially,   aid also to a certain faith in the future.    The unsatisfactoriness of the whole position, however,  was illustrated by the fact that, while there were certain shipowners who for one reason or another were able to get freights at a level Of 100 per cent more than they did before the war, and were able to give orders for further shipbuilding,  the ordinary tramp steamer was only getting freights at 10 per cent., above the pre-war standard.   Accordingly, so long as this enormous dis-crepancy existed between the ordinary freight market and the cost of the ordinary ship we could not expect British shipbuilding to be on at all a satisfactory or pre-war basis.   Any work the industry was getting was at very cut prices, and the mainstay of British shipbuilding before the war, namely the cargo ship, was providing very few orders just now.   The general tendency of orders for the poorer class of boat, barges and the other cheaper classes, was to go abroad.    The cargo ship today might make both ends meet, if she was lucky; if she  was unlucky she sustained heavy losses; and so long as the cargo shipowner, the tramp shipowner, was in such a parlous condition, we should not get a really satisfactory condition in shipbuilding.    The cargo ship was cheaper today than she had been.    The price of steel had come down in the last few orders.   A consider-able proportion of German plates was used in our ship-building.    It was not unusual to quote a price, and if the owner insisted on British steel he had to pay more.
SHIPBUILDING AND ENGINEERING.SIR JOHN THCRNYCROFT did not think there was much he could usefully say with regard to the branches of shipbuilding with which his firm was associated.    People were not very much interested in war ships at the present time;   but when they were, one would like to see the ships built in this country. With regard to smaller craft, it seemed a pity that barges of the type used on the Thames should in the last year or two have come entirely from the Continent.   Firms who used them said that if they could buy tags and barges from 25% to 30$   .. under British prices, they had no alternative but to do so, These vessels came mostly from Holland.With regard to the motor industry, certain firms were doing quite well with light cars, and said they were having a good export business;   but it was doubtful whether one could call it good if one contrasted it with the business being done by other countries.    There was practically no export of British vehicles to Europe, especially the eastern parts of Europe.   The Italians and the Germans largely dominated that part of the world.   A great deal of British capital was employed In the Argentine but there were practically no British vehicles there, and in Brazil also there were very few.    The export of motor vehicles from the United States to Australia and New Zealand were greater by value than the total exports of motor vehicles from Great Britain.As to the home market, from the point of view of selling commercial vehicles, one could not disregard the probable boom of the lighter types of American commercial vehicle unless there was some legislation to stop it.    Our Municipal Authorities, If allowed to have &quot;bus routes as well as tramways, would be quite good potential buyers.    That appeared to be the most hopeful market, - passenger carrying vehicles;   but at the present time people would not make up their minds to purchase because they did not know what the attitude of the Ministry of Transport would be, what limitations in weight and so on they would impose.    It would help very much if a decision were arrived at, both from a buying and a manufacturing point of view.ELECTRICAL TRADES. SIR PHILIP NASH wrote as follows&quot;The Home market for electrical plant is very quiet, and no doubt this is largely attributable to the pending Government legislation on the question of electric power supply.    I fear that both on the plant as well as on the cable side of electrical manufacturing the Home market will remain in the present condition for some time, as big projects in this country are bound to be held up until the new Bill Is at any rate well in the committee stage.&quot;The Export market remains fairly good, and should continue so, as far as one can see, but prices remain unremunera-tive due to continuance of keen foreign competition&quot;.
COTTON.COLONEL SEDDON BROWN had nothing good to report in the cotton trade.    It was, if anything, worse than ever.    As regards spinning, they were still only working just over 30 hours a week in the American section.    The Egyptian section was running practically full time but on a very considerably reduced margin.    In East Lancashire a number of looms were stopped, particularly in the Blackburn district.    The only bright spot in the cotton trade was that India had been buying fairly freely, though her orders were confined to certain lines such as dhooties and very light cloths.    It was, probably, only fair to say that some of the acute depression which had occurred again was due to the very big drop in the price of raw cotton.    The price was sliding away both in the Egyptian and American sections to such an extent that the buyers of the world at the moment had lost confidence and no one seemed to know where the bottom was.They were badly affected in Lancashire, as would easily be imagined, by the situation in Germany which Sir Arthur Balfour referred to (in the &quot;Steel&quot; paragraph). That was one of Lancashire&apos;s biggeBt markets and the whole of their organisation in Germany to-day was not even attempting to sellj all its energies were directed towards the collection of debts.MR. JUDSON agreed with Colonel Seddon Brown that it was a doleful story they had to tell in the cotton trade. Huge stocks were accumulating in spite of the fact that India had probably taken more than she had done for the last five years.    In fact,  India had just about saved the situation from complete stoppage.    The 30-1 hour week was causing a great deal more unemployment, irregularity of employment and unrest among the workpeople.    They had been having short time more or less for the last five years and they could see no end to it.    Of course, neither could the employing side.    These stocks were accumulating to a tremendous and alarming extent, and 3ome mills would have to undergo some financial reconstruction or re-arrangement before very long.    The banks were putting some pressure on to the firms to sell, and some firms were selling at a big loss purposely to turn money over.    It was under-stood that when these sales took place the banks commandeered the money, and things were drifting from bad to worse.SIR. W.  CLARE LEES wrote as follows:-&quot;The position in Manchester remains very much the same as it was a month ago.    If anything there has been rather more business booked.&quot;The volume of enquiry remains large and in certain sections of light goods the bookings have been quite heavy, but these are largely confined to the Calcutta market and to two or three sections in Lancashire, so that the general benefit has not been very widely spread.&quot;There has been a tendency during the last few days for other Indian Markets to get into order, but the general volume of business is still much less than Lancashire requires&quot;.
WOOL.MR. ANDREWS stated that during the last few months wool prices in Australia and New Zealand had remained remarkably steady. The return to the grower in Australia was no doubt fair, but in New Zealand it was rather low. On the other hand, the price to the user was quite attractive. French competition for wool in Australia had been rather poor for the last three months, no doubt because of the fall of the franc, and English buyers had been able to take the bulk of the wool.    So far as the west Riding was concerned, in the wool combing section the merino trade was pretty good and the cross bred trade rather poor.   In the spinning section also the merino trade was good, largely on account of the dress trade which we appeared to have been able to secure for the spring season, as against the French last season.    The home trade in the cross bred section was fair, but the export trade was bad on account of the German financial position.    Germany was wanting yarn but could not   pay for it.   The weaving in dress goods was quite satisfactory again, no doubt on account of the possibility of a Safeguarding Duty coming into force.   Men&apos;s wear was not so good, and the heavy woollen trade was rather bad, probably because of the disturbance in the Far East.   On the whole the situation might be said to be betterf and the improvement was almost entirely due to the English merchant not daring to place orders with France for fear of not getting the goods.ARTIFICIAL SILK.MR. ADDISON said that the February figures showed a distinct improvement over January, and more trade was being done.   The hosiery trade had shown the usual improvement at this time of the year and in a month1s time demand in that branch of the trade would be in full swing.   The home weaving trade had been doing badly but demand was beginning to revive. In other branches the off take seemed to be about normal.   In foreign markets the competition was especially keen and Continental competitors, especially in Italy, were accepting out prices in almost every market in order to keep their footing at the expense of the English producer.POTTERY.MR. HOLLINS reported that the state of the pottery trade had improved, and the level of exports was still being maintained, with a slight increase to the United States, but with still a downward tendency as regards the Argentine. The prospects of the trade in general might be described as very hopeful.
GOB FID &amp;W TIAL.SCOTTISH CO-OPERATIVE WHOLESALg SOCIETY.MR. GALLAGHER wrote enclosing a statement of sales of the Scottish Go-operative Wholesale Society which showed that the sales for the Sight weeks ending 20th February, 1926, were 3 l/7$ less in value than those for the corresponding period in 1925. This, however, he thought was merely a temporary set-back which should soon be got over.GENERAL    TRADE.MR, BRAND observed that there had been a fueling in the money market in this country during the last we^k or two that there was going to be a fall in the Bank Rate * . That seemed to be a oase of the wish being father to the thought in the discount market, because they had been losing money.   The discount rate had been low and money had been rather dear.   But a fall in our Bank Rate seemed to be out of thev question if one looked at the New York exchange i^ate, which had fallen a good deal during the1 lfesi day Or two and was now 4.85, and particularly wlien one observed the discount rates in New York. Digdbunt rates in New York were still considerably below this marketj    their three months rate was about sf, and even with rates considerably lower, we still had a very weak exchange, so that there appeared to be no question of a fall in the Bank Rate here.It was interesting to hear what Sir Arthur Balfour had said about German conditions (see the &quot;Steel&quot; paragraph), because while money was very scare for industry, there was a lowering y of rates In the money market itself.   It was a peculiar position, It came perhaps partly from the great taxation in Germany and the accumulation of funds with the Government for the Dawes payments - and it also came from the fact that America had been lending a lot of money to Germany.   There had been a little sort of boom In the stock market in Germany.   The Germans themselves said this was a foreign boom,  that is, produced by the flow of money Into Germany to buy securities, and so forth, which might also easily flow out again, and therefore it was not permanent business.   A very short time ago all the German banks would borrow dollars for one,  two or three months at something likeThey would now not pay more than &amp;%, which showed that they had got all the foreign currency they wanted.   German bankers seemed to think that while conditions were still very bad, they had reached a somewhat sounder foundation then before.   A great number of bankruptcies were taking place of concerns which had to go, and it was thought that fundamental conditions were generally sounder.As to the French situation, Mr. Brand was surprised at the firmness of the exchange in view of the political situation. A French banker had said that one of the great difficulties was that the publio were charged so much by the banks for advances, that they found it better to take their short-dated bonds to the Treasury and get notes out.   Their great difficulty in France was the floating debt.   They had got this enormous amount of short-dated bonds which could all be turned into cash.   There
was no doubt that the note circulation would have to increase because prices were bound to rise there.     It was the old vioious circle, and the difficulty was to know how&apos;to stop it.As to Belgium, many of the authorities seemed to be satisfied that they oould hold the exchange at about 106, but the one great danger to them was the French franc.     The Belgians, as soon as the Frenoh frano fell, purchased goods in France, and bought French securities.     But they had succeeded in cutting the connection between the French franc and their own - the one was 131 and the other 106 - and they hoped to maintain the separation.In the United States the general opinion seemed to be that conditions were not quite so good, or likely to be as good, as they were last year.   They thought that the points of danger were the motor industry and the building industry, both of which they considered to be over-extended;   and they also felt the dangers of the prevailing extraordinary instalment credit system.     One could now not only buy a motor on the instalment system, but could pay for the repairs on the instalment system.0OL0NEL WILLED thought that some trades showed improvement and others not much improvement.   Taking the situation as a whole it weald seem that the early promise of January was rather tending to fade away, and a distinct appearance of hesitancy was developing, with increased disinclination to any forward buying in any trades.     Such increased production as had developed was usually for very prompt delivery, no buyer being inclined to oommlt himself far forward.   Probably that was the result of the uncertainty as to the Coal Oonsnisslon&apos;s Report, and was also probably due in a good many trades, to the Amerioan situation.Emphasis had been laid upon the German position and the effect which the decreased purchasing power of Germany was having on different trades;    certainly it was emphasised in the remarks which had been made on the cotton trade and referred to in those about wool.     The amount of currency in circulation in Germany was so low - only about where it was before the war, as against a large increase in this country and a still larger in France, - that one wondered how Germany&apos;s buying power oould be stimulated sufficiently to correot the present position of under-consumption.     In the textile trade the reduced purchases of the world were some-thing which this country had to take definite note of, because there was no doubt,  - taking America which was the country with the highest purchasing power, - that her purchases of textiles had been proportionately less, than   before the . war;    in faot, the textile trade had alone been singled out for decreased purchases in spite of the era of extraordinary prosperity in America,   As our textile trade represented about 401 psrcent,byvalue of our- exports,   the diminishing demand in the world for textiles would have an enormous influence on our export figures, a nd that was going to mean a redistribution of our industrial population..............*&quot;&apos;&quot;..... *jf     r-cj cjGENERAL   TRADE    (OONTD .)
GENERAL TRADfc (CONTP.)MR. MA CHIN regretted that, looking at our,-industries as a whole, he could not see the hopeful prospect which Sir Arthur Balfour had spoken of in relation to the steel trade.   In the produce markets and food industries we were holding our own, perhaps, &quot;but the expansion which we had hoped to gain was very slow in coming,,   Mr. Ma chin had been through some large textile mills in Lancashire, and they seemed there to be in exactly the same position.    They were carrying on, but were saying, &quot;We are waiting, we are looking for better times which are very slew in coming&quot;.    The real reason for the suspense was probably the unsettled state of the labour market.   Until we got that position cleared up and knew where we were, he was afraid we should not reach either full confidence or development.Mr. Ma chin observed in connection with conditions in Belgium and France that a company with which he was connected had works in both those countries, and they did not find that the advance in wages had kept pace in any way with the advance in France in the franc   Wages were a good deal lower both in France and Belgium, and in France at least the men were working longer hours than they were here.   The branches in both countries seemed to be very busy, and were working under more advantageous conditions than here.BANKING.MR. TENNANT sent in a Report, as follows:&quot;Monetary conditions during February have varied some-what,  4g$ having been paid on a few occasions for overnight accommodation.    In the last week of the month 4% was the ruling rate, but it is not anticipated that conditions will become easy prior to the end of the Financial Year.   Bill Rates on the other hand have weakened considerably owing to the continued Continental demand and the scarcity of commercial paper.   Six months bills have changed hands down to Zyq% and three months bills have been done at about 4^8^.   Treasury bills resulting from the weekly tenders were allotted at 016 in the first half of the month, easing to 4Y8% for the last two weeks.&quot;The Bank of England appear to have secured a large proportion of the gold available but the export demand continues to be fairly strong.    The last week in the month resulted in a net influx of  1,002,000, making the total efflux since the restoration of the gold standard  10,226,596.
BANKING ( CON TP ,)&quot;The New York rate has remained fairly steady, although sagging slightly at the end of the month.    Japanes-e Yen continued to appreciate during the month rising at -one time to nearly 2/od.The month has been an active one as regards new issues. Several of the larger ones were as followsBelfast City and Distict Water Commissioners.Issue of  500,000 5%   Redeemable Stock 19 41-1961 at 98%%.Cardiff Corporation.Overs cribed.Issue of  .1,500,000 5% Redeemable Stock 19 45-65.55% to Underwriters.Percent Valley Water Board,Issue of  1.25 0.,000 Derwent Valley Water Board .5% Redeemable Stock 19 46 -56.Liverpool Corporation,59 % to underwriters .Issue of  3,000,000 5% Stock 1941-61, at  100 per cent.16% to Underwriters.London County Council.Issue of  7,000,000 5% Consolidated Stock 1940-60 at 99i%.Oversubscribed.London Power Company.Issue of  3,000,000 5% Redemmable Debenture Stock at 96%.Stoke-on-Tr ent Corporation.Oversubscribed.Issue of  500,000 5% Redemmable Stock 19 41-51.2Q% to Underwriters.&quot;The market for gilt-edged securities has been remarkably firm and steady, in marked contrast with those dealing in non-fixed interest bearing securities, and speculative and semi-speculative issues.    There were also several issues of an industrial nature such as Paper Mills, Drug Stcres,Trust Companies, et
*) o q4 JUBANKING (Contd.).The price of tin was very steady with an upward tendency, but x-ubber has receded the whole of the month and closed at no better than  /Id. causing a decline in the price of the various shares.    Oil shares under the pressure of forced a sit-ins-of British Controlled Shares have likewise been lowered? 39llXn* although an advance in the price of petrol at the end of the month was sufficient to give a little fillip to the market&quot;!SHIPPING.SIR ALAN ANDERSON observed that freights were a little better at the end of last year, and therefore the laid up tonnage decreased. But freights had lately been very bad, and even a little support like the demand for coal in America had its black side, because the return market was absolutely knocked out by the ships wanting tr get back again. Homeward freights from the Plate were extremely bad, and therefore there were rather higher rates ruling outwards.Looking at the Statistical Data which were before the Council (see the concluding pages of this Note) it was rather interesting to consider the relation, between the present and the pre-war periods, of the railway receipts, freights and bank clearings, as three typical things.    The bank clearings, pre-war, were just 50;% of the present clearings, the railway receipts were 6C7S and freights 90fa.    This showed how very much out of relation the general movement of freights was as compared with the two other factors.As to other points, Shipowners felt warmly about lighthouse finance.    They thought the lighthouse service ought to cut its expenses; it seemed to be a bad example of a sheltered trade at the moment.    They were glad that the proposal of Trinity House that a ship should be compelled to deviate in order to pick up a pilot did not meet with the approval of the Board.    Its re-actions on our shipping abroad would have been very harmful.Mr. Andrews noticed that freights in general were now 10;i above the pre-war level, but he pointed   that on wool they were up 100%.Sir Alan explained that the freight levels   cited in the Statistical data related to rates for tramp and not liner shipping.    Wool did not travel by the ordinary tramp but wanted a particular ship, and the rates for this liner business were quite different from those given In the Statistical Page.
-RAILWAYS.MR. HILL stated that the railway receipts showed a slight improvement.   At the last meeting of the Council it had been stated that the receipts for the first three weeks of the year were lower by  107,000 than those in the corresponding period of 1925.   During February, however, the situation had so far improved that by the end of the first seven weeks of the year, that Is by 21st February, receipts showed a net increase of  72,000 over the corresponding figures for 1925.    The largest inorease ( 90,000) was obtained by the London and North Eastern Railway.    The inorease in the total receipts of the railways was due to development of passenger traffic, and the total receipts from freight traffic were still slightly behind those of 1925, which were in themselves bad.The latest detailed figures for traffics available were those for the month of December last.    In that month the tonnage of freight carried showed a small inorease over that for December 1924.(.9$) due to increased traffic in general merchandise (2.6%),and in coal, coke and patent fuel (2.5?6)j but receipts from all freight traffic were lower.As regards particular traffics, there was a considerable reduction in the quantities of building and road-making materials, on account perhaps of the exceptionally unfavourable weather in December.UNEMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS observed that the general unemployment figures for February had gone down in a reasonably satisfactory way.    At the end of the month the total was 1,125,800, or 75,000 less than a month previously, and 110,000 less than at the same time in the previous year. The downward   curve this year had been rather better than it was in the corresponding period last year.    As the Council were aware, for the last few weeks the Ministry of Labour had been publishing detailed analyses of the unemployment figures, distinguishing between &quot;wholly unemployed&quot;, &quot;temporarily stopped&quot;, and ,?casuals&quot;. Between the end of January and the end of February the number of &quot;wholly unemployed&quot; fell by 65,500, and that of &quot;temporarily stopped&quot; by 17,000, whilst &quot;casuals&quot; increased by 8,500.- In reply to a question by Mr. Samuel as to whether the entry of more women into industrial employment has thrown more men into unemployment, Mr. Phillips said that It would not be easy to give a definite answer. Undoubtedly the number of women workers was higher than before the war, but on the other hand a great deal of the unemployment to-day was in trades which employed men only, such as mining, shipbuilding, and the iron and steel trades.    But again there was much unemployment or under-employment in the cotton trade which was largely a women1s occupation.    On the whole, he would say that probably there might be a&quot;little in the suggestion, but not very much.
&amp; lJi USTANDARDIZATION.THE PRESIDENT remarked that he had been discussing with various people the possibility of standardization in orders placed by Government departments. Local Authorities, Institutions,  etc.     For instance they might agree among themselves as to the types of hollow-ware they should order, and so give firms a much cleaner run of orders, with the result of oheaper production, whilst enabling the firms at the same time to be free to specialise, without prohibitive cost, in items where they had had to do so in small quantities.    Standardization was adopted in many Government orders, but of course these were comparatively small.    It might be worth while for the Chambers of Commerce   to combine their consideration of the matter, particularly in bringing the matter before Local Authorities.    Sir Philip had suggested to the Lord Mayor of Birmingham that some Local Authority like his might invite a conference of Local Authorities in general to discuss this matter.   The evidence submitted to the Balfour Committee showed what had been done; and it was more than many people supposed.Sir A. Balfour agreed; but thought that it was well to start with the manufacturer and find out what he suggested. One of the main points to persuade manufacturers to look at was the great saving of capital. They could reduce stocks of semi-finished articles to small proportions, and the saving of locked up capital would be enormous.Sir James Lithgow observed that one of the difficulties in standardising - unless one dealt with enormous quantities, -was that arriving at a standard was apt to increase, perhaps not the average price, but the minimum price, because it was difficult to get unanimity on a particular item without some-what increasing the minimum specification.    A great deal might be done, however, as long as the matter was looked at from the oconomio as well as from the efficiency point of view.    Sir James thought that &quot;the information which the Mercantile Marine Department of the Board of Trade oould give regarding standardization of ship fittings would be of value in pursuing the question.Mr. Machin said the matter was taken up at least ten years ago by the London Chamber of Commerce, and certain branches of industry met together with the idea of arriving at some conclusion, but they found it exceedingly difficult to reconcile all the specialities of the different manufacturers.   Mr. Machin would, however, again bring this to the notioe of the Chambers of Commerce.Oolonel Willey said that the Federation of British Industries had been very active in this matter and had been making many investigations during the last year.    All evidence they could get established beyond doubt that American efficiency was very much stimulated by the mass production made possible by the policy of the Secretary for Commerce in his deliberate grappling with this trade question.    Take the best example, paints and varnish.      There was a multiplicity of products, whioh meant enormous cost
STANDARDISATION (Oontd.).in quotations and distribution, and large capital involved In locking up the stocks which thedistributors had to carry-wholesale like our hardware merchants.    The Secretary for Commerce sent for representatives of both trades, and each said that while they were ready to do anything,it would be impossible to standardise because the buyers would not do their part. The result, however, was that by his personal effort he solved that difficulty and got all the interests together? and by the standardisation of paints and varnish they had reduced the -varieties of products and the volume of capital required throughout the country in the carriage of 3tocks, and therefore cheapened both the cost of production and distribution.    That could be applied to large numbers of things like hardware.Colonel Willey assented to a remark of the President&apos;s that this was a much easier thing to do in a country with a high protective tariff and ninety per cent, internal sales. He continued, however, by giving an example from a branch of trade with which he was familiar? there were something like 152 public bodies in this country buying police and various uniforms, and the prices, from the lowest to the highest, vary by as much as HOfo.    That was not economy.    There were about 132 different specifications to be filled up by a manufacturer in order to attempt to get the business, and that contrasted strongly with the methods of Henry Ford, who had established a single standard invoice.The President said that meanwhile there seemed to be no objection to his going on drawing general attention to the subject, and if he could usefully take a lead, he would be very &quot; glad to do so.    He suggested that the members of the Council should turn it over in their minds, and at next meeting he would ask them for their further views.BRITISH INDUSTRIES FAIR.THE PRESIDENT said he had learnt from the Committees both of the London and   Birmingham Fairs that they were very pleased with the results achieved, and were both extremely anxious that the Fair should be put on a permanent basis. It seamed to be the general opinion that, in point of the number of people attending, and the firmness of the orders placed, the Fair was far better than anything we had had since 1920, the boom year.Mr. Machin said he had been much Impressed with the great development and the improved conditions which were evident at the London Fair this year. He thought this was largely due to the lead which the Government itself had given. They had come forward as the hosts of the foreign buyers, and this attitude seemed to be responsible to a great extent for the keen interest shown by those buyers.Mr. Machin hoped that if it was decided to make the Fair a permanent annual fixture, consideration would be given as to the location. He did not think one could consider the present position at the White City, ideal.    It was not central enough. In Birmingham they had a great advantage over London in this respect.
9 /? 9t.l      tvBRITISH INDUSTRIES FAIR  (Contd.).Mr. Lindsay desired to supplement what Mr. Maohin had said about the results of the British Industries Fair. India was not very widely represented, but the results were certainly excellent.   The Indian exhibits were chiefly fancy goods, ranging from carpets and fancy silks and other textiles to lacquer ware, carved woods and brassware.    This year there had been a good demand for brassware, which was a rather distinctive production, a very large proportion of It lacquered. There was a very fine show of it&apos; in the British Industries Fair.   A much better class of goods was coming from India at present to the London market and that market was beginning to impose its own tastes and standards on the Indian manufacturer, which was all to the good.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.In MR. SANDERSON&apos;S absence abroad, the following report was sent by Australia House:-Very dry conditions prevail generally in Australia, with the exception of the north coast of Queensland, where very heavy rainfalls have been recorded.    Several &quot;bush fires have occurred in the Southern States.The Australian Meat Council reports that conditions are very bad in the Queensland cattle districts of Hughendon and Richmond.    There is a shortage of fat cattle, but not sufficient to delay the opening of the meat works next month.There is a general shortage of butter supplies within the Oommonv/ealth, and the quantity which reached Melbourne during the week ended 20th February was only just beyond consumptive demands; Victoria will soon be importing from the northern States.    The price of butter on the Victorian market on the 1st March, was 18o/8d. per cwt. - equal to 158/8d. London parity.    The price operating in Queensland and Sydney, New South Wales, was 182/- per cwt.   Reports from these States indicate that peak production has been reached, and in South dairying districts, relief from dry weather conditions is wanted. South Australian prices average 207/8d.    This State is now depending on imports, while the production in Tasmania Is so short that fair quantities are being imported from Victoria.The rapid growth of the Queensland sugar crop is reported, as a result of the much needed rains.    The crops of tobacco in North-east Victoria are reported as rather backward, owing to lack of rain, but crops generally are far better than they have been for many years.Realising the national aspect of forestry in Australia, the Federal Government in co-operation with the several States, will open next year in Canberra, the Federal Capital, a forestry college to deal with all branches of this work. In order to save time, arrangements have been made to take over the existing college in Adelaide in the meantime.-15-S8&quot;.&apos;..........................&quot;................1 i*!iu-*..i-..*.M^..................
INDIAN TRADE.Mr. LINDSAY said -that the event of the week, as far as India was concerned, had been the Budget.   When Sir Basil Blackett took up his post three years ago he found an aggregate deficit amounting to one hundred crores of rupees, which at that time was the official equivalent of one hundred million sterling.-In his first year he produced a square Budget, in his second year he produced a surplus of three millions; last year there was a surplus of one million,-and for next year he estimated a surplus of twov millions, so that the whole position had materially altered sinoe his tenure of office.As regards the pieoe goods trade, the position for the last four years was that sterling had been gradually depreciating in terms of the rupee -.    The result of that ought to have been   an increased demand for British piece goods; but at the same time there had been a progressive depreciation ef the yen in terms of sterling, which meant a still further depreciation of the yen in terms of the rupee.    The actual quotation a year ago had been one hundred and ten rupees per hundred yen as against two hundred and ten four years ago, which was a fall very much greater than that in sterling. The depreciation of the yen stimulated imports from Japan, and the United Kingdom had not been able to receive the full benefit of the lesser depreciation in sterling.    Now the position in the last few months had altered in respect of the exohange.   While sterling and the rupee had been steady at lust over l/6d. the yen had appreciated, and that mightpsrtly be the explanation of the increased purchases by India from Manchester recently.    The yen had gone up from one hundred and ten to one hundred and seventeen, and sterling had remained steady, so that the dealer in India when he purchased goods knew exactly what he was purchasing in terms of sterling as far forward as he could see, but he did not know what he was purchasing In terms of the yen.Colonel Seddon Brown remarked that the cloths that India was buying from Lancashire just now were not cloths that Japan made, or could make.    The difficulties that Lancashire was faced with in regard to Japan related to the cottons of low quality which Japan could make, and although the exchange oertainly helped her, one of the chief reasons why she was able to compete with this country was that she had got practically sweated labour and longer hours, together with Government assistance on the Import of her cotton.TRADE IN SOUTH AMERICA. MR. HOSE wrote as follows&quot;According to a provisional calculation by the National Statistical Department of Argentina, the foreign trade balance of the Republic for the year 1985 was probably more favourable than had been anticipated, and, when the final figures are available, a surplus of exports may be shown - although very much reduced as compared with that for 1924, which amounted to no less than ^182,685,000 (gold).    The general opinion with regard to the commercial outlook for the current year appears to be that active conditions will be maintained in the import trades - with the exception of that in textiles - accompanied--by extremely keen competition.
TRADE IN SOUTH AMERICA  (Contd.).&quot;The export movement of cereals since the commencement of the current year has been poor, and current prices show an all-round decline, but weather conditions for the maize crop have been, on the whole, most favourable.   Rain is still needed to assure a vsry good yield from the late-sown maize crop,   but the early-sown maize, which comprises probably 50 to 60&apos;fo of the total area, is already ripening.&quot;A distinct improvement continues to be shown in the position of the Argentine national finances.   Following upon -several consecutive years of doficits, the State revenue for the year 1924 showed a realised surplus over expenditure of $2,339,000 (paper), and, according to an official preliminary report, the accounts for the year 1925 will show a further surplus of some $50,600,000 (paper).    Congress has not yet considered the Budget estimates for 1926, and it appears probable that, until the next regular Parliamentary Session is held in May, monthly expenditure will continue to be authorised on the basis of last year*s estimates.    The Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, however, has issued its report on the 1926 Budget, sho?/ing Ordinary Expenditure estimated at $350,626,323 (paper), as against Ordinary Revenue of $670,181,910  (paper).&quot;A seasonal dullness in the Chilean markets for imported goodg has been reported recently, accentuated by Btringent credit conditions.    Agricultural prospects are stated to be good, and the yields of the current crops of wheat and barley are estimated to be about 2Sfo greater than those of last year. Nitrate sales have recently been made on a very satisfactorjr scale, and the export demand, in general, is good.    The Oustoir-s Revenue iteturns of the Republic for 1925 indicate an increase in foreign trade as compared with that of 192-4, the total receipts having been /l59,086,406 (gold of 18d.), as agaxnst $146,408,592 in 1924.&quot;It is reported that negotiations have been completed in London for the flotation of a Peruvian loan of  1,500,000, on the security of the Salt Monopoly.    The funds thus raised would be utilised to cancel the amount of  750,960 of the 5-g^ (Salt) Loan outstanding, and for public works   and irrigation. General trading conditions in Peru, have improved somewhat recently, and a more optimistic feeling is prevalent with regard to the prospects for the agricultural industry, while the foreign trade returns of the Republic continue to show distinct recovery from the adverse conditions of a few months ago.&quot;With regard to the situation in Brazil, cable advioes just to hand are to the effect that Dr. Washington Luiz,&apos;the official candidate, has been elected President of the Republic.    The new President has a reputation which inspires full confidence in the continuation of the national efforts to ensure further improvement in the general economic position of the country&quot;,
TRADE IN CHINA.MR. LANDALS said that with regard to imports    Into China, business in Shanghai had improved, but the strike and boycott in Canton still made all business in Hongkong very difficult. Machinery and engineering business was still much hampered by the disturbed state of the country and railways. One British firm had had to go into voluntary liquidation owing to non-payment for wagons by the Peking-Mukden Railway.   All exports from China were much hampered by the disturbed state of the country and difficulty of transport on the railways. Owing to an advance in Indian prices there was more enquiry for oil seeds,  ground nuts, etc., from China. Conditions on the Continent and particularly in Germany made it extremely difficult to put through any business at present; an improvement, however, was looked for in the near future.   A good business in raw silk was continuing from Japan and China to America and France, and there were evidences of a demand springing up in this country for raw silk, due no doubt to the duties on manufactured silk goods. British shipping on the China coast was still very much hampered by the boycott In Canton and Swatow, and at some ports on the Upper Yangtsze.Peking Mukden Railway.    There was no improvement to report, - in fact the situation was rather worse, for the military were threatening to seize the only earnings under the control of the Railway Administration, viz. on the section of the line between Peking and Tientsin.    Chang Tso Lin had about 75^ of the rolling stock outside the Great Wall, where it was immobile owing to damaged bridges.Tientsin Pukow Railway.     The through service between Tientsin&apos;Pukow&apos; had been&apos; suspended for several months. The line was now divided into three parts, with local traffic only in each section. The little revenue there had been taken by the military, and consequently no provision was being made for Loan Service requirements.Shanghai Nanking Railway.Slianghai***]&quot;Bangchow NingpoRailway.     These two lines were doing well in the absence&apos; of military Interference, but a large proportion of the revenue accounted for was for military traffic, which would not be paid for in cash.Canton Kowloon Railway.    Owing to the cessation of river traffic brought about&quot;by the boycott   against Hongkong, the improvement in this railway&apos;s earnings had been maintained but was not sufficient to cover operating expenses.Throughout the grain producing districts north of the Yangtsze enormous quantities of perishable foods were rotting at the railway stations owing to lack of transport facilities.
