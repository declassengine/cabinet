[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1926.SECRET.    ,.    \^JJ      teJ W       usa  &quot;    Gopy No&apos;        siOf)&amp;  n r1CP. 115 (26)CABINET.EMPIRE MARKETING GRANT.Memorandum by the Chancellor oe the Exchequer. (Circulated with reference to CP. 112 (26).)Mr. Bruce&apos;s telegram of the 6th March is surely couched in a tone unusual in communications between the Governments of the British Empire. It is difficult to believe that this telegram really represents the views of the Australian people or even the true feelings of Mr. Bruce himself. It seems to me very probable that he has been urged, perhaps by representatives on the Imperial Economic Committee, to back them up in their effort to obtain as much money as possible from the Imperial Exchequer; and that the impulse behind this telegram has not originated in Australia. However it may be, the document is certainly one which, if it ever became public, would be derogatory to the dignity of the Australian Commonwealth. It is to be hoped therefore that the strictest secrecy will be preserved in regard to it.It is necessary to re-examine for a moment the contention of breach of faith and failure to keep &quot; obligations&quot; towards Australia which Mr. Bruce advances. The Imperial Economic Conference of 1923 made certain declarations about extended preferences. These declarations were not the result of a bilateral bargain in return for which we received certain measured advantages. They were simply a spontaneous announcement by the Imperial Government of the policy it intended to pursue. This policy has been carried out except in a few minor particulars, the inclusion of which would have created disproportionate political difficulty here and compromised far graver interests at [14329]
a  critical  period.    Tinned  salmon  and  the  crayfish  group, apples, tinned  fruit  and  honey were  all  adjudged  to   be  articles of food, and in consequence  it was impossible  to  put  new taxes on  these commodities for the purpose of giving preference to the Dominions.   But tinned salmon (and the crayfish group) comes mainly from Canada and in particular from British Columbia.   It does not affect Australia in the slightest degree.    Apples  also to a large extent come from Canada. Tinned fruit affects South Africa and Canada as well as Australia, and honey is so small as to be negligible.    Therefore, if we are to make Shyloek calculations, Mr. Bruce is only a loser  to the extent of a, portion of the preference on apples and on tinned fruits.    Although these together constitute more than two-thirds of the total  of the omitted food duties, the Australian share of them constitutes less than one-third.   As against this, owing to the Snowden reduction of the sugar duty in 1924 (and so large and so early a reduction was certainly not foreseen in 1923), the effective rate of preference upon sugar has been raised from one-sixth to   over  one-third,  and this confers a benefit upon Australian   sugar, the  money  value of which is   substantially greater than the Australian share of the proposed preferences on apples and tinned fruit.   There are, moreover, the additional expenditure upon the Wembley Exhibition amounting to over  1,100,000 and, from a general Imperial point of view, the new preferences created by the present Government on Silk, on the various articles comprised within the Safe-guarding of Industries procedure and though this was mentioned at the Conference the important Merchandise Marks Bill together with the restored preferences on the McKenna group.   If we are to be forced by Mr. Bruce to make these meticulous calculations of profit and loss in order to vindicate our good faith, if that is to be the kind of groove into which Imperial discussions are to be directed, jthen it is jjerlmps reasonable for us to remember that it can be demonstrated arithmetically that  Australia  is  at  the present moment  in  a better position in consequence of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government than she could reasonably have expected at the time of the Imperial Conference of 1923. So much for the charge of breach of faith.The Cabinet have, after profound reflection, arrived at certain definite decisions upon the Empire Marketing Grant, and it is scarcely consonant with our own self-respect that we should allow such an aspersion to be cast upon our good faith without pointing out in the mildest and meekest manner possible what are the true facts of the case. It is rendering but poor service to the cause of Empire consolidation for the British Govern-ment to remain silent and abashed in the face of this unmerited girding.Mr. Bruce speaks of the preferences which Australia has given to Great Britain as being worth . 8 millions a year. The main step which Australia has taken since the 1923 Conference has been to increase substantially many of  her  protective  duties  against  British goods.
Although the preference in our favour against foreign goods has been somewhat improved, this- feature of the latest Australian tariff is entirely subordinate to the main object of domestic protection. The President of the Board of Trade has told us that the advantages of this Act to British trade are at the best negative. It is a striking comment upon Mr. Bruce&apos;s claims that, in spite of the fact that we are continually lending very large sums to Australia which presumably go out in the shape of exports and the interest of which comes back in imports of Australian produce, British exports to Australia have remained stagnant in the last three years whereas imports from Australia have increased by 50 per cent, in the same period.But the main object of this paper is not to dwell on the comparatively restricted and even petty scope of the existing preference duties on either side. The original policy of Mr. Chamberlain in 1903 was to give preferences to the Dominions on bread, meat and dairy produce and also presumably on certain raw materials like wool through the imposition of a new series of taxes on these articles of basic consumption and raanu-facture. Since circumstances make it impossible for that policy to be adopted in any future we can reasonably foresee, ought we not to seek for some new means of carrying forward the further development of Imperial consolidation ?From this point of view, the telegram which Mr. Bruce has sent about improved and accelerated shipping&quot; services between Great Britain and Australia is worthy of the most careful examination. Here we are dealing not with the often questionable and still more often inappreciable results to be achieved by haggling over the restricted preferences which are now alone possible, but with the. achievement by the Empire of a new cohesion arising from a natural advantage. The reduction of the distance from Australia to London by a week or ten days if it were commercially and technically possible would be an event of practical and historic moment far exceeding any results which can ever be obtained by the present limited system of preferences. If such an acceleration of sea transport were combined with efficient air services from Bombay, still higher possibilities are opened to passenger traffic. It is indeed a melancholy fact that in 25 years practically no curtailment of the length of the voyages to and fro has been achieved, and that Australia still remains as deeply plunged in the abyss of ocean as at the end of the last century. I do not attempt to express an opinion about the business aspects of Mr. Bruce&apos;s proposal or its effects upon existing vested shipping interests, but upon the principle there can surely be no doubt of the magnitude of the policy revealed. The remoteness of Australia and New Zealand is the greatest impediment to closer union. It may be in our power to reduce by more than a quarter that wasteful gulf. A subsidy for such a line of steamers as Mr. Bruce suggests would be only in a very minor degree a subsidy
to shipping. If the scheme is practicable it would&apos; help every industry concerned in Anglo-Australian trade. It would facilitate the outward movement of our population and mitigate the sense of distance. It would make the whole Empire more compact and coherent and render possible far more intimate and constant intermingling of their leading citizens. It would cause no opposition in Great Britain which could not easily be overcome and certainly no division which would place any appreciable mass of the wage-earning population in antagonism to the idea of closer Imperial unity. Is it not the time to open this new door to Imperial consolidation ?W. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, March 17, 1926.
