NATIONALISATION OF MINING ROYALTlEbNote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I CIRCULATE, for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum prepared by the Treasury.W. S. treasury Chambers, March 18, 1926.1. The Coal Commission^ arguments for the nationalisation of Mining-Royalties are very halting and do not themselves provide much ground for reversing the hostile view of the Cabinet Committee of 1925. One rests on the absurdity of surface ownership governing mining boundaries, on the multiplicity of leases, and on the possibility of holding up mineable coal. But the Commission admit that &quot;the defects of the past&apos;&apos; in this respect can in any case not be changed, and they seem greatly to underrate the effects of the Mines Facilities Act, 1923, and its possible extension. It is surely possible to secure mine planning by control without ownership.It is far from clear that the Coal industry will not be more hampered than helped by the State ownership proposed. In future, before any new mineral deposit is to be worked there will have to be tripartite negotiations between the State, as owner of the coal deposits, the lessor who is to work them and the surface landlord, from whom surface rights will have to be obtained. It is obvious that if the surface landlord can make his own terms, the value of the minerals will be greatly reduced and wide powers will have to be taken by the State to override the surface owner; there is certainly a case for extending the powers given by the Working Facilities Act to secure amalga-mations and to purchase compulsorily any necessary way leaves. But it is difficult to see the economic necessity for the State to go further than this.The other argument is the miners&apos; &quot; discontent at a charge being levied on the fruits of their labour for the advantage of individuals in return for which neither enterprise nor work has been given.&quot; So far as this complaint has any foundation, and is not a mere antiquated shibboleth, it is not, in fact, remedied (though it may be obscured) by the Commission^ scheme for giving the owner a payment by the taxpayer instead of the actual royalty.2. The Commission do not appear to have taken any evidence on the general financial effects of the issue of Government stock, estimated by them at  1.00,000,000. But these effects are likely to be so serious that only an overriding necessity could justify such a programme at this moment. Let us make the not inconsiderable assumption that  100 million is the maximum to be found, and that, in view of the estimated  6 million annual revenue, this can be financed without appreciable cost to the taxpayer. The great object of financial policy in the next few years must he to secure the conversion of 5 per cent. War debt into debt bearing a lowrer rate of interest. It is hardly conceivable that we can continue for long years a debt interest charge of three-eighths of the total Budget. If we do not succeed in conversion, we shall be in measurable distance, at any rate, of a capital levy, if not of more violent repudiation. Every  1,000 million which can be converted to 4 per cent, would save  10 million a year. In the years from 1927-29 the Treasury has the opportunity of dealing with nearly  3,000 million 5 per cent, debt, and must probably deal with nearly  1,000 million. Whether it can do this profitably or not depends entirely on keeping down the supply of Government Stock, with which the investment market is already seriously congested. While since 1920 we have not borrowed for Budget purposes, and have substantially reduced our debt and so improved our chances, we have undone a good deal of the benefit by the very large issue of indirect Government stocks, e.g.,  75 million of Trade Facility Loans, very [14331]
extensive Local Loans (now some  35 million a year), and remain committed to  15 million Guaranteed Loans-for East Africa and Palestine and  33 million Guaranteed Electricity Stock to come. These issues already hang over the market and depress our credit, when successful conversion requires that it should rise. To add  100 million to them is a serious matter. If we glut the market with additional Government stocks we shall prevent the fall of interest, on which the profit bf conversion depends, and thus lose the opportunity which the existence of maturities will present. The problem of our capital requirements and their relation to debt conversion was already for the next year or so both more difficult and more neglected than the income problem of the Budget. The Commission^ proposal thus hits our finance in its most delicate place and at the most inopportune moment.It is no answer to say that the scheme merely substitutes a Government security for an existing marketable asset (in the form of a mining lease). The whole point is that the effect of the substitution is to relieve a market which is of no importance to Treasury finance and further overload the already bloated Government stock market.The result may be that, instead of being able to exercise our option to convert in the next four years at a rate below 5 per cent., we may have difficulty in renewing our maturities without going above that rate. The greater expensivsness of British Government issues would react on all public authority and industrial issues proportionately. As &quot;the lay-out of present mines cannot be radically changed &quot; (p. 82), and the Commission do not contemplate interfering with existing leases, many of which have long periods to run, we may be running these serious risks for very little practical purpose.From the standpoint of general public finance, there is, therefore, everything to be said against acquiring mining royalties at this juncture. It certainly should not be contemplated lightly or admitted if modifications are to be made on other cardinal points of the Report.
