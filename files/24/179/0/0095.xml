10 Downing Street.   -V-.7.1-      12.20. p.m.      12.5.26.BoPR I PI J liiTST 21.  -   . x. :.-Ugh, will you be good enought o make&apos; a st at enent ?;IR. PUGP;    V/ell sir, when we separated something over a week a,;,.o it was  of course recognised and expressed on both sides that the ultimate end would be a settlement of this matter by negotiations and although the  conflict has been very much extended and developments have taken place since then clearly both sides and all  aides and all parties have had in view,  they must have had,  the ultimate arrangements that would have to be made to bring this trouble to a successful end.      ./e,  of course,  like yourself, have had despite whatever developments might have taken place, everybody has had to direct their thoughts in that  channel and to use such opportunities as presented themselves and such, public opinion that  existed with a view to effecting a resumption of negotiations.    In that respect,   sir, your contribution was made in the statement  delivered - to the people of the country through the wireless stations.    That was something which we on our side certainly could not ignore.    en the other hand we had. been exploring other possibilities with full knowledge that whatever happened and however long the present position lasted or whatever might be its consequences in the long run the process of negotiations would have to be gone through.    Well,   as a result of developments in that direction and the possibilities that we see in getting back to negotiations ant your assurance,   speaking for the general community of citizens as a whole, that no steps should be left unturned to get back   to negotiations,  we are here today,   sir, to say that this general  strike is to be terminated forthwith in order that negotiations may proceed and we can only mope may proceed in a manner which will brin,, about a satisfactorylo
settlement.    That is the a.uiouncoaent which ay General  Council.B.is empowered to make.PRIME MINISTER:    That is the general strike is to he called of forthwith?MR. PUGH:    Forthwith.      That means immediately. There is just a point about the actual arrangement, but that is in effect what it means.      It is merely a matter of the best way to get  it done with the least  confusion.PRIME MINISTER:        I mean there would be a great deal of work for both of us to do.&apos;     All I would say in answer to that is I thank God for your decision and I would only say now,  I do not think it is a moment for lengthy discussion,  I only say now I accept  fully and confirm fully all I have said in the last two paragraphs of my broadcasted message.      I shall call my Cabinet together forthwith, report to them what you have said and I shall lose no time in using every endeavour to get the two contending parties together and do all I can to ensure a just and lasting settlement.        I hope it may be possible before long to make a statement  of the lines on which we hope to accomplish that  end.MR. THOMAS^:        Only one or two of us wish to say anything to you and it will be very brief.    You answered us in the way we knew you would answer us, namely,  that just as you recognise we have done a big thing in accenting the responsibility we felt sure the big thing would be responded to in a big way.      We are satisfied all too well that it will not be a day or two or a week, in which the dislocation and difficulty can be put right, but whatever may be the view of the merits of the dispute now ending there is common agreement that assistance from those who were opposing parties ten minutes ago is  essential to rectify and. make good and start things on tire right road again.        Your assistance in
B. .QQ 7that.) is necessary3  our assistance is necessary.    We intend to give it  and in doing that we believe you can help.    We wantyou to help us in that  direction - I never liked the word warand I da not want to use it, but we want your help when this dispute is ended.   We trust your word as Prime Minister.   we ask you to assist us in the way joix only can assist us byasking employers and all others to make the position as easyand smooth as possible because the one thing we must not have guerillais ^sarxixaa. warfare0    That must be avoided and in that both sides have to contribute immediately.     Nothing could be worse than that this great decision which we have taken should be interpreted otherwise than as a general desire to do the right thing in a difficult moment for the industry of the nation.IIP. BE VIM&quot;:      I think you will agree in the difficulties we have had before us,  at least we have taken a great risk in calling the strike off.    I want to urge it must not be regarded as an act of weakness but rather one of strengths    I am not talking of strength of muscle and brawn but rather that it took a little courage to take the line we halpe done.    I want to stress lir .Thomas &apos; s point and ask you if you could tell us whether you are prepared to make a general request as head of the Government that., facilities etcetera, eady facilities for reinstatement  and that kind of thing shall be given forthwith.    The position is this.    Some of the undertakings that are affected,  of course,  are affected by Associations which are get-at-able,   otherwise are all over the country.     When this goes out  in the Press it may cause untold confusion, but  if you could agree with us to make a declaration it would I think facilitate matters and employers no doubt have been acting at least in carrying out the spirit.
Beof the Government during the fight naturally and they would no doubt respond to a statement of that  character and I would put it to you very strongly that that is one of the easiest ways of doing things.    One of the reasons I want to put it to you is thiso    In a dislocation of this character it does affect production very much, especially in producing trades and if there is a resumption withac a sort of good feeling then the thing gets back on to its usual  footing very rapidly0      If there is not then it  does affect the restoration,, I remember after the 1912 Strike when we were beaten Sir Joseph Broodbank went into it very carefully and the loss in output of transport was something like twenty-five per centD for some time^, until the war,   We do not want that kind of thing.    We have had a row and it  does upset things, but we are quite willing to co-operate with our men to repair the damage just as much as the employers, but the employers are the people who can facilitate that kind of feeling and I am sure they would respond to you if you issued that  as a statement.      It would be very helpful to us before we left the building if we could have some indication in that direction because we shall have to send telegrams to Unions whose headquarters are not in London with whom we cannot  converse and coupling with it   a declaration from yourself would in a way give the lead a3 to how the thins is to be approached.    You said,  sir,   also you were going to call the parties together in order to effect a just settlement.      i\row we have, called our show off and work will be resuming pretty quickly,,    I do not know whether I am overteepping the bounds but I would like you to give me an idea of whether that means that there is to he a resumption of the mining operations with us or whether all the negotiations have to be carried on while the miners still
f? q Qwowboremain out 0lfflo THOMAS:     That implies that we interpret your speech to mean what I an sure it did. mean,mi. bjtgviif:    it helped us to rise to the occasion. i thought personally - of course it is so difficult when you have to take it without  conversing - i really felt in the event of our- taking the lead in assuring you we were going to play the game and put our people back that it was going to be free and unfettered negotiation with the parties very speedily because thousands of our people cannot go back if the colliers are still out and if the  colliers are still out it is going to make it  extremely difficult to get  a smooth running of the machine0    Those are the two points I wish to put to you.prims iilisistisr:   Well, Mr0Bevin,  i cannot  say more here at this meeting now,    i did not know what points you were going to raise or that anything would be said beyond the statement of      0Pugh.    The point you have put is one l must consider and i v/ill consider it at once,    i would only say in my view the best thing to do is to get as quickly as possible into touch with the employers,,      i think that the quicker that is done the less friction there will be,    You know my record.    You know the object of my policy and i think. y&amp;S may trust me to consider what has been said with a view to seeing how best we can get the country quickly back into the condition in which we all want to see it.    You will want my co-operation and i shall want yours to try ana maJ.ce good the damage done to the trade and try and make this country a little better and a happier plac^. than it has been in recent years, That will be my steady endeavour and i look to all of you when we are through this for your  co-operation in that.    iBa
shall do my part and I have no doubt you will do yours 0    In regard to the second point there again I cannot  say at this moment what will happen because I shall have to  see the parties o   My object,  of course, is to get the mines started the first moment possible and get an agreement reached,,    I cannot say until I have seen them exactly what  the lines will be upon which my object  can best be attained, but you may rely on me and rely on the Cabinet that they will see no step is left unturned to accomplish that end,    Eow3 Mr oPugli^ as I said before^ we have both of us got a great  deal to do and a great deal of anxious and difficult work and I tliink that the sooner you get to your work, and the sooner I get to mine&apos;the better,MR, HIGH:    Yesy  that  sums up the position forthe moment 0MRU BEVIM:    I am a little persistento    I do not want to table  up your time,  but  shall we be meeting on these two points soon?PRIME MINISTER:    I cannot  say that, --r0Bevinc    I think it may be that whatever decision I come to the House of Commons may be the best piece in which to say it 0    I cannot say at the moment whether the better thing would be to  do it there or meet again, but we are going to consider right away what is best.(The proceedings then terminated)10f Downing Street,   siWolo 12th May, * 1926 0
