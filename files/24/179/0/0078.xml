This Document is frh^ Property of His Rritannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] 8^1T5ralTTSsttuctions to Viscount Cecil for his Guidance in attending the Meeting of the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference to be held at Geneva on May 18, 1926.MyLord,1. THE! Preparatory Commission which you are to attend on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government meets on the 18th May. Its business is to explore the principles on which a scheme for the general reduction and limitation of armaments might be formulated in accordance with article 8 of the Covenant for the consideration in an International Conference of the Governments concerned.2. There is one preliminary question which naturally arises, viz., whether, hi the endeavour to fix a ratio ofArmaments&apos;&apos; between individual States, the &quot; Armaments &quot; maintained by each Dominion would be considered separately from those of Great Britain and of other Dominions, or whether, as in the case of the Washington Conference, the Armaments of all the Dominions and of Great Britain would be considered collectively. This question, though, of course, of great importance, is not, however, one which seems likely to be directly raised during the earlier deliberations of the Preparatory Commission, but is rather a matter which would come up later on, perhaps not till d  the Disarmament Conference itself assembles after the report of the Preparatory Commission has been adopted. In any case it would be very undesirable that any discussion of this question at the Preparatory Commission should take place until the Governments of the Dominions have had an opportunity of considering it. For this reason you should endeavour to prevent any discussion of the question at the forthcoming meeting of the Committee.3. Before passing to an examination of the resolutions adopted by the Council of the League, there is one other point to which it is advisable to draw attention, namely, the present situation of the armaments maintained by this country in relation to any future schemes of reduction or limitation of armaments.(a.) Our Imperial naval forces were considerably reduced after the war -indeed, millions of tons of warships were scrapped, and then a further considerable reduction was brought about by the Washington Ce*rferei*ee. By this agreement a definite limit was imposed on the defensive power of the larger surface vessels, he., battleships, battle cruisers, cruisers and aircraft carriers, but similar restrictions were not applied either to submarines or to aircraft. You should endeavour to Correct this omission. Up to date nothing has been done to limit the power of attacking the trade routes, either from the air or under the water, and so long as that is the case it becomes more and more incumbent that our naval forces shall be numerous enough to defend the Mercantile Marine, on whose maintenance the Empire so largely depends. Before any further limitation of our naval forces could be considered, international agreement should be obtained as to the number, size and gun armament of submarines. Even if this could be effected, it must be remembered that our trade routes are very long and vulnerable. To protect them a certain number of cruisers are essential, whatever naval forces other Powers may have. The Admiralty are therefore of opinion that, even if a general agreement for the reduction of naval forces were secured, the British Empire must have very special treatment in regard to its number of cruisers. It would, however, in any case, be feasible for us to agree with other nations upon a lower limit to the size of cruisers and to the calibre of guns which they were permitted to carry. It would also be feasible to limit the size of torpedoes to be carried in all ships.Very considerable economies might follow such an agreement, which would presumably also affect the gun armaments of aircraft carriers and submarines.(b.) Our Army is notoriously small, having regard to our world-wide commit-ments and the length of our land frontiers throughout the Empire; and from the standpoint of disarmament its strength compares favourably with the forces maintained by many other States. The size of our land forces is not regulated by the size of those of any other Power, and it does not therefore seem capable of reduction in consequence of an agreement with other military Powers. -3421 [144861 jb
. (c.) Even to a greater extent than the Royal Navy our Air Forces were reduced almost to the vanishing point immediately after the war. Since then a progressive programme of development has been adopted which aims at providing-us with an air force comparable to that of our nearest neighbour by 1930. Recently this date of completion has been postponed till 1935. His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome any scheme of reduction and limitation which would result in a measure of equality being established between the air forces maintained by ourselves and the other countries of Europe. It is for consideration, pending the adoption of a universal scheme for limitation and reduction of Air Armaments whether resort could not be made to a specific agreement between Great Britain&apos; and one or more of the other European Powers.4. The Resolutions of the Council of the League of Nations in regard to the work of the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference are contained in two reports by M. Benes which were adopted by the Council on the 12th December, 1925, viz. :-(a.) Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference ; and (5.) List of Questions to be examined by the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament &quot;Conference.These two reports are attached as Appendix A and Appendix B respectively to these instructions.5. The first of the two reports mentioned above deals with the Title, Composition and Procedure of the Preparatory Commission, and only calls for comment in one pai-ticular. By the terms of M. Benes&apos; report it will be seen that the Permanent Advisory Commission is the technical organ nominated by the Council to advise the Preparatory Commission on the, naval, military and air aspects of the questions enumerated in the second report. Cei-tain difficulties arose in connection with this arrangement, and the Council, on the 18th March, 1926, adopted the following resolution : &quot; The Council invites the States represented on the Preparatory Commis-sion for the Disarmament Conference to appoint military, naval and air experts, who would sit on the Permanent Advisory Commission on a footing of equality with members of that Commission whenever it was convened to assist the work of the Preparatory Commission in accordance with the report approved by the Council on the 12th December, 1925.&quot;It is possible that in practice this proposal may be found unworkable and you *r are authorised to propose or accept any other suggestion on tke-grtmad that you &apos; iiray consider preferable.&apos; 6. With regard to the second report by M. Benes, namely, that in which he submitted to the Council a list of questions to be examined by the Preparatory Commission, there are certain points in the body of the report to which attention should be drawn before the questions themselves are examined.7. It was at one time considered that a Conference on the subject of Naval disarmament, in view of the past history of the question, would best be held in Washington. The French, Italian and Japanese Governments, however, indicated through their representatives at Geneva that &quot; they could not see their way to dissociate the various kinds of armaments military, naval and air and to consider them at separate Conferences.&quot; Since this declaration was made, the United States of America has announced its intention to participate in the work of the Preparatory Commission at Geneva. The main reason for supporting a separate Conference on the naval aspect of the problem has,-therefore, fallen to the ground.8. But the declaration of the three Governments mentioned above also raises the question as to whether each of the three kinds of armaments military, naval and air should be examined separately or collectively, for the pmrpose of fixing the ratio of armaments which is to be permitted to each State. His Majesty s Government are of the opinion that it will be very difficult indeed to combine in one index figure the proportionate strength of each of the three armaments to which each State would be justifiably entitled, since the purposes for which each of the armaments is required vary to a considerable extent. For example, as already mentioned, the strength requisite for the Navy is largely dependent on the
length and nature of the trade routes which have to be guarded, while the strength of continental armies is governed by the extent of its land frontiers) tlie nature of its relations with coterminous States and the size of the armies maintained by those States, Moreover, it seems quite impossible to compare the armament value of a battalion, a battleship and an air squadron. To reduce these dissimilar factors to one common denominator would appear to pass the wit of man, and if attempted, to be likely to lead to the adoption of an arbitrary ratio bearing no relation to the realities of the case. Each of the three kinds of armaments  naval, military and air should therefore be considered quite separately from one another.9. M. Benes&apos;s report also contains a reference to the&quot;queation. of international supervision to ensure that the provisions of any agreements regarding a limitation of armaments are being observed, and suggests that this question should be examined by the Preparatory Commission. It is pointed out that &quot; the French delegate emphasised the necessity of such supervision, particularly during the period when the arbitration and conciliation proceedings provided for in the Covenant and in the various agreements recently concluded were in progress.&quot;10. This question of supervision is full of difficulty and His Majesty&apos;s Government do not feel justified at the present time in recommending any general system of compulsory supervision, whether by the League&apos; or any Other authority.They believe that in thp. nrflHont oonrlitinn nf nat.inna.1 fl.nrl in tern normal foolivxr o^t.declared to be the friendly right oi each member of the league to bring to the attention of the assembly or of the council any circumstance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends.,t ,vwv oj vu uv aiujuisrswuu, uy Lite expression    armaments&quot;?(a.).

They therefore recommend that the expression &quot; Armaments &quot; should be defined as :--Forces immediately available on the outbreak of war and the material maintained for their use.They consider that this definition is sufficiently comprehensive for the present purpose, and that to attempt a definition of the various factors enumerated in the sub-heads to Question I would only serve to confuse, the main issue for which the Preparatory Commission was set up.Question It,(a.) Is it practicable to limit the ultimate war strength of a country, of must any measures of disarmament be confined to the peace strength?14. His Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that it is quite impossible to limit the ultimate strength of a country, and that any measures of disarmament must be confined to the peace strength only.J.14486J &apos; jj 2
length and nature of the trade routes which have to be guarded, while the strength of continental armies is governed by the extent of its land frontiers, the nature of its relations with coterminous States and the size of the armies maintained by those States. Moreover, it seems quite impossible to compare the armament value of a battalion, a battleship and an air squadron. To reduce these dissimilar factors to one common denominator would appear to pass the wit of man, and if attempted, to be likely to lead to the adoption of an arbitrary ratio bearing no relation to the realities of the case. Each of the three kinds of armaments  naval, military and air should therefore be considered quite separately from one another.9. M. Benes&apos;s report also contains a reference to the&quot;question of international supervision to ensure that the provisions of any agreements regarding a limitation of armaments are being observed, and suggests that this question should be examined by the Preparatory Commission. It is pointed out that &quot; the French delegate emphasised the necessity of such supervision, particularly during the period when the arbitration and conciliation proceedings provided for in the Covenant and in the various agreements recently concluded were in progress.&quot;10. This question of supervision is full of difficulty and His Majesty&apos;s Government do not feel justified at the present time in recommending any general system of compulsory supervision, whether by the League&apos; or any other authority. They believe that in the present condition of national and international feeling any attempt to establish such a system would be ineffective and would be likely to lead to serious friction.11. In arriving at this conclusion His Majesty&apos;s Government have had in mind the provisions of Article 11 of the Covenant by which the Council have power to &quot; take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard thepeace of nations,&quot; and it is jjj&apos; declared to be the friendly right.....peacedepends.&quot; In case, therefore, of a breach by any State of an Agreement for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments, the Council already has considerable powers for dealing with the situation thus created.12. I now pass to an examination of the list of questions adopted by the Council on the 12th December/1925. &apos;Question I.What is to be understood by the expression &quot;armaments&quot; ?(a.). Definition of the various factors -militaryt economic-, geo-graphical, &amp;c.-ilpon which the power  of a country in time of war depends.(b.) Definition and special characteristics of the various factors which constitute the armaments of a country in time of peace; the different categories of armaments [military-, naval and air), the methods of recruiting:, training, organisations capable of immediate military employment, &amp;c.13. Having regard to the great difficulty inherent in airy attempt to define, for purposes of disarmament, the full capacity of a country for war, His Majesty&apos;s Government are of the opinion that, if any practical step towards a reduction of armaments is to be secured, it is essential that this very complex problem should be reduced to as simple a form as possible. They therefore recommend that the expression &quot;Armaments &quot; should be defined as  Forces immediately available on the outbreak of war and the materialmaintained for their use.They consider that this definition is sufficiently comprehensive for the present purpose, and that to attempt a definition of the various factors enumerated in the sub-heads to Question I would only serve to confuse the main issue for which the Preparatory Commission was set up.Question II,(a.) Is it practicable to limit the ultimate war strength of a bountry, of must any measures Of disarmament be confined to the peace strength?14. His Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that it is quite impossible to limit the ultimate strength of a country, and that any measures of disarmament must be confined to the&apos; peaeg strength only,
They recommend therefore that      -All measures of limitation should be confined to &quot; Armaments &quot; as defined above maintained in time of peace, and that no attempt should be made to limit &quot; ultimate war strength.&quot;15. In this connection is should be noted that the Admiralty who advocate, as far as the Navy is concerned, the standard for a country being based on the numbers and types of ships of war &quot;maintained in peace time,&quot; consider that this term includes all warships maintained in reserve.Question II.(b.) What is to be understood by the expression &quot; reduction and limitation of armaments &quot;?The various forms which reduction or limitation may take in the case of land, sea and air forces; the relative advantages or disadvantages of each of the different forms or methods; for example, the reduction of the larger peace-time units or of their establishment and their equipment, or of any immediately mobilisable forces; the reduction of the length of active service, the reduction of the quantity of military equipment, the reduction of expenditure on national defence, &amp;c.16. His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the expression &quot; reduction and limitation of Armaments &quot; should be defined Reduction as Reduction of &quot;Armaments &quot; to a certain standard.Limitation as Restriction of &quot;Armaments &quot; within a certain strength.The other points raised in this question are further dealt with under the next one. Question III.By what standards is it possible to measure the armaments of one country against the armaments of another, e.g., numbers, period of service, equipment, expenditure, &amp;c. ?17. The answer to this question in regard to naval forces is comparatively simple, as no great difficulty is encountered in defining a &quot;unit&quot; where vessels of war are concerned. For naval purposes therefore the standard of measurement should be The number and size of ships and the calibre of the guns carried.18. With military forces the question is, however, very complex. Broadly it may be said that it is essential to combine in some form the numbers of men available and the nature and extent of the equipment for them.19. The abolition of the system of conscription, as understood by the chief military Powers of Europe, would of itself impose a certain measure of Disarmament, and it has the advantage that no complicated formula is required for application to each individual State. His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise, however, that it would be difficult to secure its adoption.20. Another proposal is the reduction of the period of service in conscript armies. This, however, though it might have some political and economic advantages, can scarcely be regarded as an adequate solution of the problem of Disarmament, especially if the States concerned resorted to an intensification of the training of reservists and the introduction of civilian labour for administrative services.21. Other methods of achieving the same end, such as the compilation of a schedule of military equipment, or the fixing of budgetary expenditure which must not be exceeded, are also open to objection, &quot;though a well-defined limitation of expenditure on material might be a useful subsidiary check.22. The primary basis of any scheme of land disarmament must be a limitation of effectives. A restriction of the number of men automatically imposes a certain limitation on the amount of material, since a given number of men cannot usefully handle more than a certain amount of material.   Further, it would be useful if thejr.     i&quot;-&quot;-i&quot;-       ;;:  ,............-...^.-rr.7-..,,.-----.., .. .........................   .......................
expenditure incurred on certain definite and limited classes of military equipment could be regularly ascertained. Owing to the different methods by which Budgets are draw up comparable information of the character required is not at present available in the National Budgets; but it might be arranged that each State should furnish the League regularly with a detailed statement, in a comparable form, of the estimates of expenditure on the items selected at the commencement of each financial year, and of the actual expenditure as soon as possible after the^end of the financial year. If possible, statements should also be obtained of the stocks held from previous years, and of the extent to which they are drawn upon.23.   His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore recommend that the standard of measurement in regard to military armaments should be &apos;The  number  of  effectives,   together  with  the  amount  of  equipmentappropriate to their use,and they add that :Regular statements, in a comparable form, of the expenditure on such equipment might furnish a valuable indication as to the &quot;Armaments &quot; maintained.24. One of the great difficulties in regard to air forces lies in the fact that it is quite impossible to divest civil aircraft from very considerable potential military value. Nevertheless, although the existence of civil aircraft constitutes a grave military danger, which must at all times be taken into consideration, His Majesty&apos;s Government are of the opinion that in order to initiate a measure of disarmament in the air, civil aviation might, in the first instance, be disregarded, although it must be emphatically stated that the question of any reduction of air armaments is in fact indissolubly allied with that of limitation of civil aircraft.Owing to the special circumstances affecting Air forces at present, there is some difficulty in recommending a standard for them. But His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion that, subject to any modification that might be agreed on as the result of consultation between the air experts of other countries and our own, the following-standard would be the most practical: &quot;&quot;&quot;The establishment of aircraft of service types to be maintained in com--, ^    - . mission in first-line combatant units of the Metropolitan Air Forces.&apos;&quot;   UMklV. t tf Xi*Ud$*Question IV.Can there be said to be &quot;offensive&quot; and &quot;defensive&quot;&quot; armaments?Is there any method of ascertaining whether a certain force is organised for purely defensive purposes (no matter what use may be made of it in time of war), or whether, on the contrary, it is established for the purposes in the spirit of aggression?25.   His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion that It   is   impossible   to   distinguish   between   offensive   and   defensive &quot;armaments,&quot; except in the case of fixed defences.Question V.(a.) On what principle will it be possible to draw up a scale of armaments permissible to the various countries, taking into account particularly Population; Resources;Geographical situation;Length and nature of maritime communications;Density and character of the railways; iVulnerability of the frontiers and of the important vital centres near \the frontiers;The time required, varying with different States, to transform peacearmaments into war armaments; The degree of security which, in the event of aggression, a State couldreceive under the provisions of the Covenant or of separateengagements contracted towards that State?
26. His Majesty&apos;s Government are very doubtful if the various elements suggested in the second part of this question can have other than an indirect bearing on its solution. In any case, it is quite impracticable to devise esar index figure&apos; which would represent all the factors involved. Other methods of arriving at a basis of comparison between the armaments of the various States have been suggested and they are worthy of attentive consideration. But from whatever basis a start may be made, His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that in the end the settlement of the problem must be left to special negotiations with the various States concerned when the other problems of disarmament have been settled. When that has been done a much more favourable atmosphere for approaching this final problem will have been created and the difficulties which are now admittedly formidable may be more easily resolved. You should therefore urge that the discussion of this question should be for the time postponed.Question V:(b.) Can the reduction of armaments be promoted by examining possible means for ensuring that the mutual assistance, economic and military, contemplated in Article 16 of the Covenant, shall be brought quickly into operation as soon as an act of aggression has been committed?27. It is understood that the object of the question is to secure an examination as to whether Article 16 of the Covenant can be regarded as effective at present and as to what steps can be taken to make it more effective. You should urge that though the British Government are prepared to enter into such an examination, they feel very strongly that a reduction and limitation of armaments would in themselves so greatly increase the security for peace as to render enquiry into Article 16 of much less importance.28. It wrould appear that Article 16 of the Covenant, when originally drafted, contemplated economic pressure being applied primarily by measures taken within their own jurisdiction by Members of the League without necessarily being accom-panied by a Declaration of War.29. To be effective it is necessary that these measures should be taken simultaneously and uniformly by all the principal nations of the worlds--a condition which in present circumstances cannot easily be fulfilled. There is, therefore, a grave danger that those States which acted at once would merely be strangling their own trade for the, benefit of those who delayed or refused to take action, and would thus inflict more damage on themselves than on the Covenant-breaking State.30. The amendments to Article 16 and the principal resolutions adopted by the Second&apos;Assembly &quot; as rules for guidance&quot; are designed with the object of securing so far as possible unanimity and uniformity of action on the part of members applying economic measures against the aggressor. They propose that action should be taken inter alia in the following progressive stages : (a.) The Council should, at the request of any Member, deliver an opinion as to whether a breach of the Covenant has taken place or not, and, in case of the former, should notify to all Members the date on which it is proposed . that the application of economic pressure should commence.(&amp;.) The Council should recommend a plan of joint action, which in the-&apos;first instance should involve the severance of diplomatic relations. Other steps would follow when it was seen which of the Members of the League were prepared to carry out their obligations, such as the severance of com-munications and direct commercial relations with the aggressor&apos;s territory. If these failed, the cutting off of food supplies should be adopted and it was recognised that in special circumstances, the imposition of an effective blockade may be advisable involving the declaration of a. state of war between the Covenant-breaking State and the other members of the League.In so far as these proposals would tend to secure uniformity of action, and also to indicate the extent to which States are willing to proceed against the aggressor, they are of value.31. Any further examination of the Article should be directed to ensuring that the obligations under this Article should be made more precise, and should at the same time be such as can and will be carried but, having regard to the fact (a) that
the action which each State is to take must, in the first instance, be within its own jurisdiction, and (b) that the economic pressure must be enforced uniformly by all save in the most exceptional circumstances.32. -^Should limited measures of this kind fail to secure submission, measures of increasing stringency may require to be taken. As a final stage the Council will presumably recommend that war measures be taken and States Members deciding to declare war against the Covenant-breaking State will exercise full belligerent rights. By Article 16 it is left to each State to decide whether a resort to war by a Covenant-breaking State has actually occurred, and whether, in consequence, the obligation undertaken by Article 16 has become effective.33. In regard to any proposals of this kind, His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to reiterate that the real menace to security in many areas is the competition which exists between neighbouring Powers in the maintenance of excessive armaments, and that measures such as are contemplated by Article 16 for dealing with acts of aggression after they have taken place do little towards the removal of this menace, which can only be brought about by an effective agreement for a Reduction of Armaments and their subsequent Limitation. His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, could only contemplate contributing to additional or more precise guarantees of security in exchange for definite and substantial guarantees that a genuine scheme of Disarmament will be enforced, and that the degree to which this country would assist an attacked State should be made dependent on the extent of the policy of Disarmament agreed upon by the Conference and on the measure in which that policy is put into effect.Question VI.   .(a.) Is there any device by which civil and military aircraft can be distinguished for purposes of disarmamentf If this is not practicable, how can the value of civil aircraft be computed in estimating the air strength of any country?(b.) Is it possible or desirable to apply the conclusions arrived at in (a) above to parts of aircraft and aircraft engines?34. As has already been pointed out, it is not possible to distinguish between civil and military aircraft for disarmament purposes, but an arbitrary distinction might with advantage be- drawn in the first instance in order to make an advance towards disarmament in the air possible. Should this course be adopted, however, it is essential that all &quot;military&quot; air armaments should be considered as a whole, and separately from land and naval &quot; Armaments,&quot; since aircraft normally destined to co-operate with armies and navies can, without either any difficulty or delay, be diverted from their normal functions to operate independently as air forces pure and simple.Question VI.(c.) Is it possible to attach military value to commercial fleets in estimating the naval armaments of a country?35. Though undoubtedly commercial fleets do possess a potential military value, the answer to this question depends on the circumstances in which these commercial fleets are employed. To a country dependent for its existence on seaborne supplies, -the safeguarding of its Mercantile Marine is one of its main war commitments, and, although it may employ certain mercantile ships for military purposes, the military value of such support is completely overshadowed by the commitment; in fact, a commercial fleet becomes a military weakness. But-in the case of a country not dependent on overseas supplies, a Mercantile Marine may become a distinct military asset, though not of first-rate importance.Question  VII.Admitting that disarmament depends on security, to what extent is regional disarmament possible in return for regional security? Or is any scheme of disarmament impracticable-unless it is general? If regional disarmament is practicable, woidd it promote or lead up to general disarmament ?
o36. In so far as the Locarno Treaty is concerned, it might be argued that Great britain&apos;s commitments as guarantor had been increased. On the pther hand, in so far as Agreements, such as the Locarno Treaty, make wars,Jess;likely,-ourcommit-ments have in effect been diminished. As a generalisation, H^s Majesty&apos;s Government are therefore of the opinion that regional security does ma;ke:avmeasure of regional -disarmament possible. ;.
