PRIME MINISTER:      I have asked you to see me this morning because I do not think you seem to be getting on very quickly, and yesterday evening the Executive Committee of the Trades Union Council asked to see me, and they put to me the question which you have been putting to them, the question of there being a stumbling block at the moment in the way of getting together, that stumbling block being an alleged attempt or decision of the owners to try and engage in district negotiations,      Now they did not criticise that - It was not their business to - it was their business to report what this was and to see if I could smooth it over, and I thought the best thing I could do was to ask you to come and see me without delay just to tell me in your own words exactly what this point is,  and what you have to say about it for the information of my own mind, so perhaps If you would be good enough to do that,  I shall be obliged, because I have you all here, and I shall then know what you have to say about itaMR. HERBERT SMITH:      With r egard to that, Mr. Prime Minister, you and your colleagues know that for some time we have had national agreements, and I think I am right in saying that after the control they were continued, and we are asked by the owners to simply go Into our own districts and ascertain from them what is going to be the position re wages.      To that we object9 We say to these people - and we are supported by the Corn-mission5 s findings to a certain extent - that the first duty is national negotiations.      They tell us that they have not material to supply us with, because they do not know each other&apos;s districts      Well,  it is very awkward, after you have been meeting men for years,  to tell them they have not been speaking the truth. But I want to put it to you and your colleagues that the Miners&apos; Federation and the Mine Owners&apos; Association know more to-day about each other&apos;s districts and their capabilities than ever they knew before.      They have had joint accountants working,  and we have had joint accountants1 reports submitted to each of us
giving each side that information,  and If I can picture you being on this side of the table and me at that side of the table - not as Prime Minister, I do not want your job -- but being on that side of the table,  and saying to these people &quot;Here, you get back to your Individual districts and ascertain what the position of that district is re future minimum,  &quot;I think you. would be like us,  you would hesitate and say &quot;We have a national agree-ment, we Intend it to be national in character1,  and if you people have any,submission to make to us,  either as one proposition or by sectional propositions,  then the national movement Is the first thing to submit It to,  and then we will sit down and reason with you   and see what we will do&quot;.PRIMS MINISTER:    Remember,  I have not seen any particulars, nor have I discussed anything with the owners, but I am putting this case:    supposing,  for the sake of argument,  that a proposal T.ra;-3 made to have,  say,  a national minimum with variations above that minimum according to the quality of the  district, that is a matter that should be argued nationally before this body.      That is the point,  is it not?MR.  HERBERT SMITH:    Yes,  it should be submitted to this body, and that body will give due consideration to that,PRIME MINISTER:    I see the point, but I just wanted to put it in other words so that we may know that we both mean the same thing ftMR. HERBERT SMITH:    Because if we have to look at this position, we have always got to rest on your statement as Prime Minister when you met the officials that you realised that there would be reductions,  and it may be inferred that they would be varied, and that although the Commission has said that the subsidy has&apos; got to cease on the 30th April, you were prepared, if both sides settled,  to give some consideration to the relief of the heavy cut,,PRIMS MINISTER:    Temporary assistance I think I said for a
:C r; nshort period.MR. HERBERT SMITH:    A temporary period of three months.PRIME MINISTER:    That Is to ease the burden.MR. HERBERT SMITH:    Yes.    How do we know, how can we know what is going to be the position of the owners, and what they are going to say to us?PRIMS MINISTER:   Vie cannot know anything until we have seen some figures, and I want some figures, and want them quickly.MR. HERBERT SMITH:    If you look through these notes of the meeting we have had with the owners, we have been appealing to them, and pleading with them - not threatening - to supply us with some material for disuussion to see where we are.PRIME MINISTER:    Yfheh you get that you are ready to meet them?MR. HERBERT SMITH:    Yes, whether we get it or not.PRIMS MINISTER:    What is in your mind is - I do not say this is a correct reading of what is in your mind - that by going down or suggesting going down to make direct negotiations with the districts,  you feel they are going behind your back and trying to do something which may damage the organisation of the Federation,MR. HERBERT smith    I am not going to ask what is in your mind,  but you have put It clearly,   and we shall resist it to the bitter end.      It will be a national kick-off if it is to be a kick-off at allePRIME MINISTER:    That is just what I wanted to get at.MR.  COOK:    I take it  that you have not. yet had an oppor-tunity to read the  shorthand notes of the proceedings?PRIME MINISTER-:    Which proceedings?MR.&apos; COOK:    Between the coal owners and ourselves.PRIME MINISTER:    No,  I had a copy last night,MINISTER OF LABOUR:    I have also a copy,  but I have not had an opportunity of reading it.MR. COOK:    My suggestion Is that until you have read those notes,&apos; both the copy you now have before you and the copy we
s)      ?1are having printed - a copy of the  day before yesterday s proceedings, you will not understand clearly our position.PRIMS MINISTER: I think I have got it pretty well from what Mr,Smith has stated. I want to get your views fully on this, because it is a&apos;very Important point.MR. COOK:    T.e Chairman has spoken fully and carefully putting it to you that when they were pressed for the figures, they said they did not know them.      That is incorrect.     Their statement was that wages should be based upon the capacity of the industry to pay.      Your Department and you also know month by month, and we know how every district stands - what we never knew before,  and when they come and make a statement that there must be substantial reductions, our Chairman said that they do not know either in the districts or here what those reductions would be, and in face of that notices have been given to-day.      It does seem a strange thing,     The whole point of the matter put b:/ the Chairman is that the Miners&apos; Federation is prepared to discuss meanwhile with the owners If and when the-1? put forward proposals for a wage agreementsPRIME MINISTER:    I see.      This answers the question i wanted an   answer to,MINISTER OF LABOUR:    The question I wanted an answer to, which I think Is what the Miners&apos; Federation set store by,  Is that no action should be taken which - whether intentional or not - might tend to break up the Federation and weaken its central control.      That is really,  I think   the point which you have got at heart.MR.  COOK:    There is a further point which I am sure our President  will realise,  and we ought to discuss it now - to put us in the position - and the Government possibly - of an attempt to deprive our men in the event of a crisis of unemploy-ment pay,      Instead of being prepared to discuss the differences between us, they are preparing ahead as though for a crisis in the action now taken of notices being given,  some notices being-4-
knowingf- j** rt,given without/ the conditions, because they made out to us that it is not only the question of wages, but customs and other things in the district, that must be reviewed and discussed, and they declared that that was a matter for the districts first to consider.MINISTER OF LABOUR:      I had a talk, as you know, with the Mining Association yesterday afternoon, and I raised quite definitely the question of notices with them,      I said it mightlook to the general public as If they were looking to there*being a break.      Well,  I got the assurances from them at any rate that that was not their object at all, but that they were putting it up because, supposing that anything did happen, they would be bound to have given a legal noticej    in any event they would be bound to give a notice of the legal length of time beforehand.MR. COOK:      Do they mean a contractual notice?MINISTER OF LABOUR:      Yes, a contractual notice, and that is why it appeared in the resume In the &quot;Times&quot; of the meeting which I had with them.      They are bound to give by law a notice of a certain given length under the contract.      If you have a contract of    wages of a particular rate, and you want to alter that contract, you have got to put yourself at any rate in the legal position for terminating the old contract, and it does not presuppose, and my own honest opinion is that they never intended it so - that any inference was to be drawn from it that they were riding for a break.      I did not gather that for a moment from them.     I asked them about this question.     They wanted to put themselves right from&quot; the legal point of view, but they looked forward to negotiations going on,  and at any rate, as I was hoping, as far as I could gather they are as anxious, I think, to come to a settlement as you are.      Iddo rot know if you have seen the actual official notice.      The owners explain that having regard to the legal position respecting contracts of service,  it would be necessary for  the owners to give formal notice terminating contracts.     This did not   imply * termination
of the contracts.      On the contrary,  this will exaplai-n that negota tions are contemplated with a view to agreement as to the wages to be paid after the 30th Aprila.MR. COOK:      You must read that in the light of their opera-ting on the 30th Aprils      In the first place they are going to invite representatives to meet then, and they informed you that they are going to give notice, and they say presumably that in the .-;ase of a failure of district settlement they are going to put the proposals on the pit tops that work can be resumed at other rates0MINISTER OF LABOUR:     As to that, I should not think they would do that, at any-rate so far as I could gather yesterday0 I have not read your conversation with them first of all-, and from that point of view it is a pity because I wish I could have done so, but I did not gather that they really intended more than merely putting themselves formally In the right position,      I frankly say that the only reason why I regretted the thing myself was that people might not realise that you have to take a. regular legal step, and they might put a con-struction upon It which was not intended.      That quite frankly was the regret I felt that anything like notices should be put up,. But I think,  after my talk with them it was not intended for more than that.      The point which I have got in mind, and this is with regard to a. district settlement, Is this.     This is the only difficulty, and I am putting It perfectly straight to you,    I see what you have got in mind, and. quite naturally, which is that you do not want anything to be done by way of districts which, as I say, would whether intentionally or not, weaken the central power of the Miners&apos; Federation.      That I think is quite clear.     As far as I can see,  their trouble is this, that they realise that the capacity of the different districts is now extraordinarily different -----MR. VARLEY:      Have we left the other point?      We are not impugning their intentions, we are only talking about the situ-consideration created by their actions,  and their action by giving a
Inotice as if they were spoiling for a fight, and rather worse,   ^-j^ *it does this, they presuppose that negotiating ations will go on, but whatever the result of those negtoations, the wage which in their opinion it will be possible to pay in that district will be posted.      Immediately that puts on our men the onus of breaking contracts and disqualifies them under the operation of your Acte      It was that.      Their intentions may be the best in the world, but their action has certainly thrown on our men the impression that they   ant to fight, and put them in the cart in any circumstances with regard to the payment of unemployment pay,MR, SMITH:     You have to look at this from two or three different points.,      I think it is realised,  I think you will realise by and by when we come and talk to you about certain proposals In this Commission&apos;s report as to labour and its effects - it is realised that some pits, we are sorry, have to go out of Production,     That is the first thing, and they are taking their cue from what has happened before.      In Yorkshire i   we lost unemployment pay, and when the Sunday night shiftfinished,  between Monday morning shift and afternoon a notice goes up continuing on at this price,  and you people say that is a trade dispute, irrespective of whether that pay was paid or not.     The next thing is that it is not necessary in all cases because we settle reductions and advances by mutual agreement without giving notices; and we are in rather a difficult position this time.      You hove had to step in to assist the position, and the owners say that assistance looks like disappearing and we are not going to be able to foot the bill, so we have to give you contractual notice.      I want to ask you people here, this is bigger than a miners&apos;  question, it is a national and serious question whether it would be&apos; wise to attemptto give notices.     They have drawn first blood by giving theinotice, but they will get retaliation from, cur jken-- the worstrthing that could happen.     We have been pressing them if yoHread this printed discussion. We ask you people to come with us and get
some definition as to where we are going to kick off;we are not prepared to jump the dyke until we can see the other side, and they are safeguarding themselves by a method which will do these men out of relief underthe Unemployment Act.      There are thousands of men whowould he entitled to it because the pits would automatically stop,   whether there were subventionsor not, unless there is going to be a revival oftrade and so on.    That Is what they are after.    Wehave been through it and suffered it,  an&apos;d some of us feel fairly keen about it.    There has been anagreement since 1862 in Yorkshire,  and we got thiskind of notice, and we came to London to get help.We were told it was a trade dispute.      When youpeople decide it is a trade dispute,  then theseowners have got to be made to pay.      We were working at g/7d;    we went back at 2/lOd.      Thatoaused 8 more pits to stop.    It cost thousands of pounds to get that for  the men and we were deprived of benefits.    In the case of other trades,  the engineers and  joiners,  the point is what is therate of pay in the district,  and the rate of payought to be the criterion.        That is the difficulty,Mr. Prime Minister.    V/e are not questioning yourhonesty at all,  only having a straight-forwardtalk.    We want to be absolutely straight with you.We do not tell you we accept the Report.     We tell younow,   if   you ask us,  we think we are too low, but
when we have things put before us we have to give consideration to them and give a reason if we oannot accept them, why we oannot accept them.     We are getting to a desperate position because we are dependent - it is no good saying we are not - we are dependent at the present time upon the Government making a movement which, will assist industry over this stage;.    it Is no good saying we are not.    There are any amount of reforms talked about.    I went down the pit in 1072 and I want to say to you people seriously, unless there Is legislation put forward to compel reorganisation and show what re-organisation it going to be,  if I read this Report properly we ought not to be   called upon.to make sacrifices until we know what we are going to get in return to improve our positionl     I could improve it if it were left to meo    You say, but you people are mining engineers. If a man has been so many years in the pit and has not learned anything it is time he stayed at the top, that is all I have to say.    I went to a pit a few weeks sinoe in Yorkshire, a little pit, a good s^am, twelve tubs to fit twelve men and when they filled them up they went up top.    I went to the Manager and said &quot;This is wrong,  isn5t it?&apos;.     He said &quot;My father did it and his father did it and we have got on all right&apos;.      I said &quot;Come with me to Bradford1 and I showed him the engine that pulls the trams up and down.    He said  &quot;Will they run on those rails?1.    I said  &quot;Uo,  you will have to put some better rails in,  or strengthen the sleepers&apos;.    &quot;How much do you think it will oost?
I said. &apos;When we consider the first cost we ought to recllpn/llwhat tho results are going to ba, it will cost you  100to adapt yourself in that little pit and  50 for an enginelike this to do it&apos;.     he says &apos;When shall I get my moneyback&apos;.      That is the sort of idea.    That old chap] he hashis little engine running now and he invited me next time come that way to call because I was always useful.      the workman wants&quot; to see this time what reorganisation means.The employer has not done a single thing for us.      They sayTWe will give it due consideration&apos;.      Ever since 1872 theyhave been giving it &quot;due consideration&quot;.      We want to gutactual propositions now, what is going to be done. agreewith the resolution of the federation that we ought not to becalled upon to make a single sacrifice.     Thestaad&amp;rd ofliving is too low at the present time.    We ought not to becalled, upon to make a single sacrifice until there has beena thorough investigation as to what this reorganisation is.havegoing to be and until the men/appreciated. -uhe benefitof it from that standpoint.      We are still open to receive from the owners their statements and to discuss it with them.MR VARIBY:&apos;   Did you understand from tham yesterday that their decision to give notice to cover their legal obligation was Irrevocable,  that they were going on with it willy-nillyoMINISTER Of LABOUR:    I think they have asked their lawyers and were advised they had to.MR VARLEY:    So that it is no good discussing that further ?MINISTER Of MBQUli:    I do not think so, but on the other hand I honestly do not think - I can only give you my own impression for what it Is worth ---MR 000K;-    If you read, as our President has said, this Report,  it is not fair.      They issued a statement and at
the end of the Report if? their considered view and you wonder how they could arrive at those decisions in view pf the discussion.    Surely,  sir, it is a plain thing to ask and beg, what are the terms upon which you want us. to work. Negotiations,  collective bargaining has to take    place    and you discuss the terms of that collective bargaining.     You have been in industry, sir, and. in any industry whatever it is those terms.      tie can only see they keep repeating 1 Wages must be based upon the economic capacity of the industry to Pay&apos;.    Then, they go round and invite.      You will find they invite in the Eastern Area.      Further than that what did they do ?    They were prepared even to break   up the form of the thirteen wage districts by writing to Yorkshire separately and saying 1 i/i/111 you meet&apos;   ,      To think at this time of day when even in the Report there is that principle of the national agreement even discussing the breaking up and then they assume we are so divided or so simple or something that by writing a letter behind the back of the National Federation to the seme people who compose It they will get a meeting.      Well,  sir, it is the most absurd thing ever suggested in a national crisis and national negotiations.      If the position is such that they cannot carry on they are going to give notice.      Surely beforo giving; that notice they should say the terms upon which we are prepared to discuss with you an agreement to deal with A-B.C.  or D. district.      That they have refused to do.PRIME MINISTER:    I have the point quite clearly now.    I am much obliged to you for this meeting.      Of course it is my job to listen to all the complaints that each side makes either about the conduct of the other side or about the whole thing.      I am quite clear in my mind and my next duty, of course, will be to see the owners which I will do without

You may think they are spoiling for a fight and they think you are.   Mr Cook,  if you have any further meetings I should like to have copies,MR COOK:    I will keep you posted with copies of the interviews hetvvaen us,(Tho proceedings then terminated).
