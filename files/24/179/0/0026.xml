UK I VARSITY COLLEGE, 3 3 jjLONDON.19th Maroh,  1926,Dear Lord Peel,In pursuance of the suggestion made during our conversation this afternoon,  I write this letter dealing with some of the points connected with the question of the retention of the Bloomsbury Site for the purpose of the University of London,In the first place,  I understand that consider -able importance is attached, to the question whether the Site isj or is nots at the present time, effectively occupied by the University.      I would adduce    the evidence of facts accomplished,  despite the uncertainty which Ms hung over the Site question &apos;4 an uncertainty which has prohibited the raising of funds for its development and has prevented the erection thereon of anything but temporary buildings.There ere, on the Site, the following University, buildings:(a) The Institute of historical Research,(b) The Students&apos; University Unions ( c )    T he Arc hi toctural Atelier.Of these, fuller particulars are given in the appended note. Two houses in Torrington Square are already in use as residences for students 4Immediately adjoining the Site 2f acres have been acquired in Ma let Street for the &amp;ew School of hygiene    and Tropical Medicine.      This acquisition is the first realisation of extending the Site held out in the GovernmentVs original offerIncluding those and the 7 - acres already owned by theUniversity in fee simple, being the    area occupied byUniversity College,  the possible University quarter inBloomsburv already amounts to over 21 seres.-I-
This being so,  I venture to urge that, having regard to all the circui.stances, the Site, or as much of it as has been made available for University purposes is already effectively occupied *I desire further to add that the loss of the Site would be a great blow to the prospects and needs of development that are already facing the University,The task with which we were confronted in 1900,  of transforming the University &quot;from a mere Examining Board into a Teaching University, has been accomplished, in spite of very great difficulties, with remarkable success.The University is made up of a number of Colleges and Institutions that, prior to 1900, were entirely autonomous, each living its own life.These are being gradually brought together and are becoming conscious of membership of one great University,,      The truth of this is manifest among the Teachers as well as among the Students,Finally/ the University of London meets needs that no other University can, and requires most urgently some centre for the corporate activities and personal associations that are essential for the training of University men and women.      In the Faculties of Arts and Science,  in particular,  cur students are drawn in the main from the County and Municipal Schools that have come into  existence since the Balfour-Lorant Acts of 1901-20O ^ *- c*
The Bl.com sbury Site offers an opportunity for the developments that are urgently necessary and can he achieved especially if the Report of the Departmental Committee enables the University to modify its constitu-tion on an evolutionary plan.I will send you, as soon as possible, a copy of the report cf the Site and Developments Committee, that will come before the Senate next Wednesday,      I have every reason to believe that it will be adopted by the Senate ,Yours sincerely,(Signed)    GREGORY FOSTER, Provost,The Rt.Hon,  Lord Peel,  G.B.EB,c/o Mr, Tom Jones,Cabinet Offices,2, Whitehall Gardens,London, SeW,l.
9^9 (J 3 oUNIVERSITY COLLMGS,  LONDON.NOTE ON TEE BLOOMSBURY. SITS.The following fast3 are adduced as to the use of the Bloomsbury Site for University Purposes and as to its development(a) THE INSTITUTE OP HISTORICAL RESEARCH owes its existence to the Site and its value as a contra for its purposes is shown by the fact that within tho last two year3, fifteen Universities and University Colleges In Great Britain andin countries so distant as Poland and the United States have associated themselves with the University of London, in order to share in the advantages of the Institute, and to assist in its maintenance and development.The Institute is unique and is accomplishing work of vary great value.Union(b) The Students1 University/was enabled^ owing to the Site, to come into existence, find a home and provide a growing and vigorous organisation which is indispensable to any esprit de corps in a University,(c ) The Arch.it Qctural Atelier for post-graduate students. This provides a centre for post-graduate! students who are entering for competitions like tha prix de Rome to work out their designs. It has proved inva.hw.ble and has enabled the students of the Bartlett School of Architecture to take their place effectively with students of the other foremost Schools of Architecture(d)     Two Houses in Torrington Square are already in use as students^esidences.      They are worked as annexes to College Hall, Byng Place.     They are always full and there is a long waiting list of studonts desiring admission.
(e) The acquisition of the two and a half acres in Mai at Street, on which the now school of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine is being built,  is the first realisation of the possibility of extending the eleven and a half acres ofthe Bloomsbury Site which was held out as one of its advantages in the Government&apos;s original offer.      The Bloomsbury Sits is in effect not eleven and a half acres, but fourteen acres,  and,  inducing the University&apos;s land in G-ower Street, amounts to over twenty-one *(f) Other University organisations,  such as the offices of the O.T.O. , the University&apos;s Bureau of Commerce ana Appointments Board, and the University Club, have gravita-ted to the neighbourhood of this site without being ableto find accommodation on its empty spaces,  and, the question once settled, the difficulty will consist not in finding University uses for the site, but in-determining the priority of claims to share in its advantages.(Sgd)    GHEGOHY FOSTER.Brovost *80th March,  1926.-5-
