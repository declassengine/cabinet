The Cabinet were then informed that the Committee were unable to proceed with their terms of reference until the Imperial Institute Bill had become law.      That Act has now become lav/ and vests the Imperial Institute building, so far as occupied by the Imperial Institute, in a reconstituted Board of Governors.      Further consideration of the question has satisfied the Committee that the new Board of Governors will not surrender their present accommodation at the Institute for at least five years, and that even if they could be persuaded to clo so they would demand large new galleries  elsewhere&apos;.Inasmuch as no scheme  for  utilising the Bloomsbury site has matured in the course of the past five years it is incumbent on the Government to decide whether they will offer the site to the vendor, the Duke of Bedford,  in terms of the conveyance of 23rd March, 1921i      Under these terms the Duke has a six months&apos;  option to re-purchase the site at the price given.      If he does not exercise the option it will be open to the Crown to develop the property for residential purposes.      If the Government makes no offer  on or before the 1st Aoril the Government will be deemed to hold, the site forthe nurposes of London University.-1-y--.--^-     y&apos;v
The Treasury hold the view that the Treasury Minute of February,  1399 imposed upon the Government of the day-no legal obligation to find free quarters to any extent required by the University.      The Treasury admitted a moral obligation to provide London University ^ith suitable accommodation.     At the time of the Bloomsbury purchase it was made quite clear to the University that the offer was limited to the site alone and that provision for new buildings,  both of the University and of King&apos;s College, would not be found by the Treasury,  subject to King&apos;s College being compensated for the loss of their existing buildings in the Strand.The Committee recommend the Cabinet to authorisethe Treasury: -(s.) To write a letter before the 1st April next offering the Duke of Bedford the Bloomsbury site in terms of the conveyance of the 23rd March,  1921;(b) To address at the same time a communication to -London University intimating that the foregoing letter.had been set to the Duke of Bedford;(c) To conduct any subsequent negotiations that may be required,(Signed on behalf of the Committee.)PEEL,Chairman.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. March 16th,   1926.
