(n^lTS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)Copy No. Jlsecret.n.P. No. 151 (26). CABINET.MALTING    BARLEY.Memorandum by the Minister- of; Agriculture andr Fisheries.The Conservative Agricultural Committee of the House of Commons some time ago set up a Sub-Committee on Arable Cultiva-tioh, which recently reported in favour of:-1,     Malting Barley;a duty of 10/- per quarter on Imported malting barley. 2*     Wheat Insurance Scheme;that some form of wheat insurance scheme should form part of the arable policy.    [This would involve a Government subsidy of about  3,000,000 a year.] 3.     Potato Licences:that there should be a regulation on the importation of potatoes under licences so that the interests both of the home producer and of the consumer should be -safeguarded. 4.     Power Alcohol:that the subsidy to the sugar beet industry should be extended to cover&apos; the production of power alcohol. 5,     Home Grown Chicory:that the Government should be requested to take off the duty on home grown chicory. 6.     Government Contracts:that all Government Departments which Issue contracts should.be encouraged to ask for a proportion of British grown grain and meat in respect of such contracts.    &apos;&apos;*$piI explained the objections to these proposals in a discussion with the full Unionist Agricultural Committee on the^ 24th March, and in consequence no decision was taken by the full Committee on the Report.        At a subsequent meeting, however, at
which 1 was not present, the following Report of the Sub-Cor?3tittee on Arable Cultivation was presented:-&quot;Your Arable Sub-Committee beg to reportthat they have carefully considered the statementof the Minister of Agriculture in reply to theArable Policy submitted by your Sub-committee, andthat they regard the Minister&apos;a statement withprofound disappointment.     Apart from the entirelynegative attitude of the Minister towards theproposals, and in the absence of adequate reasons forthis attitude, your Sub-Committee further feel deepdissatisfaction at the complete absence of any alternative proposals on behalf of the Governmentfor dealing with the arable position, and notewith alarm the complete alteration of policy asindicated In. the White Paper,Your- Sue-Committee have passed thefollowing Resolution, -which they recommended to themain Committee for adoption, viz&quot;That this Committee view with considerable..disappointment the absence of any proposals upon the part of the Government for dealing with the grave plight of agriculture In the arable districts.This Committee are of opinion that the position of the Party in the arable counties is gravely compromised., The Committee consider that the Party will no longer be able to rely upon the support of the agricultural community in such areas.The Committee urge the Government to take immediate action to relieve the situation, and they suggest as a first step in^that direction the inclusion in the fortlfcorcing budget of the -proposed customs duty on imported maltins: barley used for brewing and distilling,^   .&quot;TheeJ &apos;X w
-    543The Resolution -was adopted by the main Committee. &apos; Although the Committee in this Resolution only mention the malting barley duty proposal, it is certain that the Members of Parliament for the arable areas would not be satisfied with this concession alone, seeing that it would only help a restricted section of arable farmers who, as it happens, already enjoy the greater part of the benefit of the beet sugar subsidy, and it would naturally strengthen the demand for some corresponding direct advantages from the districts which cannot grow barley.As it has been suggested in certain quarters that I am financially interested in opposing the malting barley duty, and also la view of the Resolution of the Conservative Agricultural Committee,  I feel that it is desirable that the Cabinet should come to a definite decision in the matter. I append a note giving the history of this question and the difficulties which would be involved in the imposition of a duty.The matter is urgent as if the Cabinet were, to decide in favour of a duty It would have to be included in the forthcoming Budget alv t G .12, 4, 26.
KAIfflNQ BARLEY.1, The proposal for a duty on imported malting barley was originally submitted by Sir Robert Sanders to the Cabinet early in 1923 and the same proposal was made by the Agricultural. Tribunal In their first report.     The original suggestion was that an excise duty of 10s. a quarter, with the usual preference to the Dominions, should be imposed on imported malting barley to bo collected at the brewery, distillery or malthouss, but on investigation it was found that any such excise duty would be contrary to the provisions of. a number of commercial treaties with foreign countries in which we had undertaken not to impose any internal taxation on foreign produce which did not equally affect home produce.2. It was then decided to appoint a committee re pre sent a.-tive of all the interests concerned to consider the machinery by which a customs duty could be imposed upon imported malting barley.     That committee, which was presided over by Capt. Falcon and included representatives of maltsters, brewers, distillers, corn and agricultural merchants, the National Farmers&apos; Union, Customs, Board of Trade and the Ministry of Agriculture, made a report in November 1923 containing a scheme for the imposition of a customs duty to be charged on all Imported barley which was declared on importation as intended for malting.     It was pro-posed that all imported malting barley having paid duty at the port should be accompanied by certificates at every stage during its progress from the port to the malthouse, brewery, or dist 111-ery, and that brewers and distillers should be prohibited from using duty-free barley.   Accordingly records woul% have to be kept by Importers, dealers, malsters, brewers and distillers showing
receipts and sales of imported duty-paid &quot;barley and similar records would have to be kept by all persons handling British malting barley except the original grower.   Maltsters would have to keep records of their malting operations and all records and. books would be open to inspection by officers of the Customs and Excise Department.3.      It was estimated that if one-third of the total Imports of barley were declared as malting barley a duty of 10s. a quarter would yield  500,000 a year gross, but the representatives of the trade on the committee were of opinion that the imports of malting barley only amounted to one-sixth of the total imports and In that case the      yield of the duty would be  250,000 gross.4.     It was not proposed that the duty should fall on malt extracts used for food or medicinal purposes or on malt used for vinegar or any other food purposes, and It was proposed therefore that manufacturers of such articles should be able to obtain repayment of the duty though it was recognised that the scheme would have the effect of inducing malt extract manufacturers to use foreign rather than British barley,5.     The report of the committee was accepted by the Government but almost Immediately afterwards the general election took place and the Government was defeated.6.      It would no doubt be possible to reintroduce the scheme prepared by the Committee but the arguments against such a; course are substantial.   &apos;In the first place the original recommendation was made on the ground that the level of prices for malting barley was unremunerative and consequently that considerable areas in the eastern counties were seriously affected.    Since then, however, prices have fluctuated
considerably.   ?,/hereas in 1922 and 1923 the average price of British malting barley was low, in 1924 many growers of malting barley did very well.    In 1925 prices were not so good, and this year there has been a further fall.    These fluctuations in price are due largely to fActuations in quality.    Maltsters must have barley of a certain quality for their malt, and when, owing to a bad season, British barley is of poor quality, maltsters are compelled to buy more foreign, even if they have to pay a higher price.   Quality, not price,  is the determining factor.7.     At the time the duty was proposed it was estimated that a d.xctj of 10s. a quarter might raise the price of British malting barley by not more than 2s. or 3s. a quarter.    The assistance to barley growers which such increase in price would give would be negligible.    The duty is, therefore, a protective duty which does not protect.8.      In the second place, a duty on malting barley would not be welcomed by all sections of the agricultural community. The users of feeding barley fear that it might raise the price of their requirements and the National Farmers1 Union made it clear at the time that in their vie?/ the duty would not be of much use unless corresponding duties were placed on malt substitutes, such as sugar, glucose, flaked rice and flaked maize.    The Customs take the view that brewers and distillers would not find it possible to increase substantially the use of substitutes without affecting the q\xality of their goods, but the Brewing trade were unquestionably of opinion that the duty would lead to an Increased, use of substitutes.   Any additional duties on substitutes,some of which, such as sugar, are already heavily taxed, would probably be Impracticable. The brewers say that it would raise the whole question of the freedom of the mash tun, and would arouse a  (*4zkJf4-$--*^Vsi &apos;^uX^X^Ju    fv-v-wv   feawv .........-jC^,vv ^u^A-, ^
9.        The duty and the necessity of keeping elaborate records right be expected to be unpopular not only with the brewers and distillers but also with the general body of the corn trade.   The representatives of these Industries on the committee Phioh drew up the scheme expressly stated that they did not agree to the policy of the duty.10.        From the Customs point of view the duty has little to commend it.   It would be cumbersome to work, it would mean placing under control a number of traders who are not at present under Customs supervision. It would raise awkward questions in regard to allowances on export, it would have to be accompanied by alterations of the Customs duties on imported beer and imported spirits and the yield of the duty would be negligible in comparison to the v/ork involved.11.        Finally, if special assistance is given to the growers of malting barley, who form a comparatively small proportion of the total number of farmers, it would be very difficult to resist a demand for some corresponding assistance to the growers of wheat, a much more important agricultural crop and one for which a stronger case can be mada out on the ground that It Is on the average less remunerative than malting barley.    Farmers In Scotland and Wales vould press the claims of oats and the potato growers vould also become vocal.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 12th April, 1926.
