nOOUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.I submit herewith for the consideration of my colleagues the conclusions arrived at by the recent conference of   &apos; . Ministers of Labour on the international regulation of hours of work in industry.The document signed by the representatives of the Governments concerned is attached as an Appendix. 1,     It will he observed that the conclusion on Article XIV of the Washington Convention, which deals with the circumstances in which the operation of the Convention may be suspended, was accepted by me provisionally, l.e., subject to the concurrence of my colleagues.This conclusion has been further considered by my Department in conjunction with representatives of the Foreign Office and the Treasury, and all three Departments are agreed that it is not necessary on merits to press for any further precision.     It could only be discussed further in conjunction with all the other members of the Conference. Failure to agree on this point would nullify the rest of the agreement.I hope, therefore, that I may be authorised to announce to the other Governments concerned my acceptance of this conclusion on the same basis as I have accepted the others, 2.     With regard to the remainder of the conclusions I consider that the specific points to which I drew attention in my previous memorandum (C,P,100(26)) have been sufficiently safeguarded, and we are in a position, therefore, to consider the acceptance of the conclusions as a whole.CABINET.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.RET..137(26).INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF HOURS    OF   WORK.
3.     In addition to the published conclusions, agreement was also reached with regard to Article IV (continuous processes), to the effect that the various powers should exchange within two months lists of what they regard as continuous processes.     If It is impossible to harmonise the lists, a committee of experts would be set up to prepare a definitive list.     As the publication of this decision would be embarrassing to certain Governments, It was agreed to keep it secret for the present.     It is not necessary on this account to delay acceptance of the conclusions as a whole.4.     The British Government, having taken the initiative in convening the conference (to see whether differences of interpretation could be reconciled and to ensure uniform hours regulation to the principal Industrial states) and provisional agreement having been reached, we should, in my opinion, announce promptly that the British Government accepts the agreement reached by the conference.     This is very desirable        from the point of view of its effect on foreign countries, if we wish them to adopt the further course of aotion which is most conducive to our interests.     Moreover any favourable effect upon labour opinion generally at home, (which is of importance In connection with the coal crisis) will be seriously prejudiced by delay.
She hours question has loomed largely In the minds of the British trade unions during the last few years and tho hesitation whloh has been shown by the British Government in ratifying the Convention has enhanced other ca\ises of unreBt.     A pronouncement now that the Government accepts the agreement reached provisionally pt the international Conference would undoubtedly have a steadying effect upon labour opinion end would, as stated above, be of value in connectIon with the Coal discussions.5.     If the British Government acoept tho conclusions, and if the conclusions are similarly accepted by the other Governments concernedt It will be necessary for the Government to proceed to the introduction of Hours Legislation to give offcot to the agreement.     The Bill might be prepared and possibly introduced in the oourse of the summer, but I realise that it will be impossible to find time for its disoussion  itils year.     It will be made quite clear that the Act would come into force only if and when corresponding legislative action has been taken in the other countries conoerned to implement the Agreement.I propose to take action through the Governing Body of the International Labour organisat-ion and through the International Labour Conference, to link the agreement reached at the London conference with the Washington Convention (in such form as may be found legally practicable) and to endeavour to secure the adhesion to both documents of as nany as possible of the Continental   States, 6,     I suggest, therefore, that I should make en early announcement, on the lines of the preceding paragraph.
Government*s decisions, it will be advisable that I should see privately the committees of employers and trade unionswith whom I was in consultation before the Conference. IThe employers&quot; representatives        have never disguised their view that the Washington Convention was a mistake and that there should be no statutory regulation of hours of labour.     up to the present their expressions of disapproval have not been very strong but they will no doubt be disappointed that an Agreement was reached, and very likely will now give expression to their views.     on the other hand, there is a considerable body of opinion amongst employers that they stand to gain by the establish-ment of more uniform hours of labour amongst their foreign competitors, especially under the safeguards obtained at the London Conference.8.     Apart from the question of legislation, there still remains the question of the ratification of the Convention. This raises the problem of the relation between the conclusions of the London Conference and the Convention, i.e. whether the various agreements reached at the Conference are within the four corners of the Convention itself.     I propose to consult with the Foreign Office as to the steps that can be taken in regard to this point, but I woiild at the same time draw the attention of my colleagues to the importance of ratification of the Convention plus the London rannexe&apos; as affording the only means by which we oa.n secure the right to challenge the action of other countries who may subsequently be found not to be giving effect to the obligations they have assumed.     I do not think, however, that there is any objection to leaving this point over for further and separate consideration at a later stage.
9.     20 sum up, I submit to my colleagues the following proposals(1)   That my provisional acceptance of theconclusion on Article XIV should he confirmed.(2)    That the Government should accept theconclusions of the Conference as a whole.(3)   That I should be authorised to announce this and to say that, if and when assurances have been received thet the other Governments ooncerned accept the conclusions, His Majesty&quot;s Government will introduce a Bill to give effect to those conclusions, whioh will come into operation when other Governments neve taken corresponding legislative action to implement the agreement.(4)    That the relation between the conclusions and the Convention find its bearing on ratification should he studied by my Depart-ment in conjunction with the Foreign office, and that the results of this examination should be submitted to the Cabinet at a later stage.(intd.) km 3.- M.Ministry of Labour. March 29th, 1926.
APPENDIX.CONFERENCE OF THE MINISTERS OF LABOUR OF BELGIUM, FRANCE, GERMANY, GREAS BRITAIN AND ITALY.The Chairman made the following statement which was approved by the members of the Conference :-On the invitation of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government a Conference of the Ministers of Labour of Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain and Italy, on the subject of hours in industry was held in London on March 15th.     The Director of the International Labour Office was invited to attend the Conference in order to supply information and advice on the practices adopted in the different States or on interpretations which might have been already formulated.      The invitation was issued by Great Britain because of her ardent wish to see effect given to one of the main objects enshrined in Part 13 of the Peace Treaty, and to consider in that connection the difficulties which had hitherto prevented the ratification of the Washington Convention on Hours.     As a preliminary step, His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, after learning that the Powers concerned, animated by the same motives, were willing to attend such a Conference, issued a letter and memorandum to the other Powers raising certain points of major importance which appeared to them to emerge in the consideration of the Convention.      To this memorandum full replies conceived in the most loyal spirit were received from all the Powers as an indication of their views and without prejudice.Although these replies revealed divergences of Interpretation, they indicated equally a common wish to secvire a settlement G&quot; this long outstanding question, and it seemed in these/circumstances
circumstances to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government that it could not but serve the all important object under contem-contemplation to attempt to conciliate these divergences by dlsciission.      The Conference was accordingly convoked upon this basis and met on the 15th March,     It was constituted as follows(The list of names has   been omitted to save space).In the discussions which continued till March 19th the Washington Convention was considered article by article.The Ministers of Labour in undertaking this examination did not arrogate to themselves the right to give definitive interpretations of the Conventions.      They were fully alive to the fact that, in accordance with the regularly constituted procedure, it lies with the International Court of Justice in the last instance to decide all disputed points which may arise upon the interpretation or the application of the Convention.     Recognising that one of the objects of the Conference has been to remove any doubts that may have existed as to the possibility of applying the detailed provisions of the Convention to the circumstances of particular occupations and recognising further that the agreements arrived at provide for the cases concerned, the Conference agrees to the following conclusions.
njjNOLjgflQgS Off THE CONFERENCE. AB3M0EB. I.It is o.greed that the Convention applies to all industrial undertakings, whatever the number of persons employed, except those in which only members of the same family are employed.It is agreed that the ordinary postal, telegraph and telephone service is outside the scope of the Convention, but that constructional, maintenance and repair work in connection with the postal, telegraph and telephone service is covered by it.AH32IOLB 11* ;It is agreed that working hours are the time during which the persons employed are at the disposal of the employer;    they do not inolude rest periods posted in accordance with Article VIII, during which the persons employed are not at the disposal of the employer^ ABBIOLB V.It is agreed that the provisions of Article v may be applied to the building trade. AHCIOLB Vl(a) .The expression &quot;essentially intermittent work&quot; used in Article VI should be interpreted in a restrictive sense.It applies only to occupations such as those of doorkeepers, watchmen, works firemen and other workers, which are not concerned with production properly so-called; and which, by their nature, are interrupted by long periods of inaction during which these workers h:,,ve to display neither phyeioal activity nor sustained attention, and remain at their post only to reply to possible calls.  JglOLB 71(b).It is agreed that the maximum limit to the number of additional hours that may be worked under Article VI(b)  is within the competence of national law a/It
It is agreed that tho obligation as to the rate of pay for overtime imposed by the Convention applies only to the additional hours contemplated by xArticle VI (b).It is agreed that the minimum additional rate of -15 per cent for overtime provided for in Article VI is obligatory. 5 Day-Week.A table fixing hours of work over a longer period than the week may be drawn up in a manner similar to that provided for in Article V in order to distribute the hours of work in each week over five days, or in two weeks over eleven days, ft being under-stood that the average working hours may in no case exceed 48 per week -Weekly Rest Day.It is agreed that any hours over and above tho weekly limit of 48 which are required by the nature of tho services rendered to be worked on the weekly rest day other than hours covered by Article 11(c), III. IV and V, shall bo treated either as hours to be dealt with under the &quot;provisions of national legislation relating to the weekly rest day or as hours to be dealt with under the provisions of Article VI. RaiIway s.It is agreed that railways are covered by the Convention. In so far as Article V and Article VI(a) are not sufficient for the needs of the railways, the necessary overtime is permissible under Article VI(b). Time Lost by Roll days.It is agreed that in cases where a state allows hours to be worked in excess of 48 per week in order to make up time lost by reason of holidays (other than national holidays or holidays with pay), such hours must bo included in tho maximum number of hours&apos; overtime fixed In virtuo of Article VI, and must be paid for at the overtime rates laid down in the said Article.Article. XIV..
A 9 0ARTICLE XIV.(l)     It is agreed that each Government will insert Article XIV in their legislation to carry out the Convention.(2)     It is agreed&quot;&quot;&quot; that use can only be made of Article XIV in case of a crisis which affects the national economy to such an extent that it threatens the existence of the life of the people.      An economic or commercial crisis, however,  which concerns only special branches of industry cannot be regarded as endangering the national safety within the meaning of Article XIV,   so that in this case the suspension of the Convention would not be  justified.It is agreed that the English, French and German texts shall be oqually authoritative.It is further agreed by the representatives of the Governments participating in the Conference that they will report to their respective Governments the conclusions,  as set out above, which the Conference has been able to reach,  so that those Governments who f     have not ratified the convention may, taking account of the agreements reached, be in a position to proceed with their consideration of the question of the ratification of the Washington convention.The conclusions of tho Conference will also be reported formally to the International Labour Office by the British Government, which took the initiative in summoning the conference.The representatives of tho Governments sign the foregoing asextracts from the Minutes of the Conference held at London on 15th,16th, 17th, 18th and 19th March,  1986.(Signed)    J. L. WAUTERS.A.  DURAFOUR. Dr. BRAUNS.ARTHUR S TEEL-MAITLAND. GUISEPPE DE   MIOHELIS.MARCH 19th 1956;ft Provisionally on the part of Great Britain1a representative.
