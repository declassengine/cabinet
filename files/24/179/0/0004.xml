-CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] SECRET. Copy No.    30CP. 104 (26).CABINET.SITUATION IN HONG KONG.Memorandum by the Secretary oe State eor the Colonies.I DESIRE to draw the attention of my colleagues to the accompanying paraphrased telegrams, dated the 26th January and the 6th February, from the Governor of Hong Kong, and to the paraphrase of a reply which I have now returned to him after consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Cabinet is already aware of the grave dangers threatening Hong Kong and of the disastrous losses which have been incurred by British trade and by the Colony since the commencement of the Canton boycott in June last.   A financial crisis was only averted at the end of September by my approving immediate arrangements for ) funds up to  3,000,000 to be made available as and when required by the Hong Kong / Government for use as a trade loan, the contributors being the West African Currency Board ( 1,500,000), the Straits Settlements Government ( 1,000,000) and i the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank ( 500,000).    I have now learned from the &apos; Governor that the advances made to the commercial community from this loan amounted on the 22nd February to rather more than  1,350,000.    The available balance is thus nearly  1,650,000, and the Governor states that there is no immediate probability of the whole of this sum being required.On the other hand, a settlement of the boycott is not yet in sight, and I feel it my duty to point out that should the continuance of the present conditions be prolonged, and should the balance of the trade loan be exhausted, it will be essential for His Majesty&apos;s Government to come to the assistance both of the Government and of the commercial community of Hong Kong. The Canton Strike Committee have so far failed in their endeavours to instigate a second general strike in Hong Kong,, but they have shown no signs of relaxing their efforts, and in a recent despatch the Governor alludes to the possibility of Chinese merchants in Hong Kong being induced to participate in the boycott by closing down their businesses. Prompt measures have been taken to counteract this tendency in its early stages, but I need hardly say that should any such development take place it would be fraught with the most serious consequences.L. S. A.Colonial Office, March 5, 1926.IParaphrase Telegram from the Governor of Hong Kong to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.   Dated January 26, 1926.(Received Colonial Office, 12-20 p.m., January 26, 1926.)I HAVE repeated this telegram (which refers to yours of the 16th of January) to Peking; and Jamieson (who is here) asks that a copy may also be sent to the Foreign Office as a reply to Foreign Office telegram to Peking, No. 15 of the 12th of January. The discussion between Admiral Sinclair, General Luard, Sir J. Jamieson, 0&apos;Malley and me was held on the 25th of January.Our suggestion is that steps should be taken by the British Government to find&apos; out (1.) Whether it would be possible to induce the League of Nations (including the representative of China) unanimously to pass censure on the existing Government of Canton,   for  its  defiance of  the Treaties  (in this, connection I would refer you to my telegram of the 14th of January); [14290] * b9Q
aIT.Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Hong Kong to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.   Dated February 6, 1926.(Received Colonial Office, 9-20 a.m., February 6, 1926.) I AM repeating this telegram to Peking and Canton.I have received from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Peking, copies of telegram No. 35 from the Foreign Office and of his reply, dated the 1st February (No. 10). A copy of a telegram, dated the 2nd of February (No. 5), from His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General, Canton, to the Foreign Office has also been sent to me. Barton.is in the Colony (on a visit from Shanghai) ; I have taken counsel with him and 0&apos;MaIley. On the 6th of February they both depart for Shanghai. In addition, I have discussed with Hallifax, Kemp and Tratman. What follows represents our unanimous opinion.(A.) It would be correct to look upon the Government of Canton as a rebel Government in insurrection against Peking and other parts of China. We under-stand from His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Swatow that it is at present engaged in offensive operations against Fukien. In our opinion, actual hostilities in Kuang Tung would not constitute recognition of an Independent Government in Canton. We consider, however, that such hostilities in Kuang Tung are not at present to be recommended. In our opinion, the time has gone by for warlike action to be undertaken in Kuang(2.) Whether (in the event of the Canton Government ignoring such a censure) all the Powers would be willing to institute a boycott of Canton pending the removal of the anti-British boycott. His Majesty&apos;s Government might put to the Powers the point that it is an unfriendly act for non-British shipping to avoid Hong Kong at the dictation of the Strike Committee at Canton.In order to render the suggested action effective, special measures would have to be taken to prevent Russian and Chinese ships from trading with Canton. Steps should be taken to find out whether this task would be undertaken by the Chinese Naval forces.It is our unanimous opinion that (1.) The Anti-British boycott is mainly attributable to the Red Russians at Canton.(2.) If the existing situation is to be relieved, it is essential that they should be removed.We are very strongly of opinion that the British Government should take action at Moscow with a view to obtaining the removal from Kwangtung of all Bolsheviks.If these suggestions are not practical politics, we cannot think of any other line of action than war with Canton. Unless, however, America, France and Japan would co-operate (and preferably other maritime Powers, too), warlike action would jeopardise future commercial relations between Great Britain and China (and particularly between this Colony and Canton).It is our unanimous opinion that, if it is not considered practicable to adopt any of the suggestions which we have put forward, there is no method by which the boycott can be ended except by holding out until the existing Government of Canton either falls by disruption from within or is overthrown by some hostile Chinese General. In this connection I would refer you to my telegram of the 13th of January.At present, therefore, the trade loan is our only weapon. Even at the risk of some eventual loss of money by the Government, it is necessary for the loan to be used generously, for the benefit of the merchants (both British and Chinese) in the Colony.Sir J. Jamieson and I are in close liaison, and there is free exchange of information between the Colony and Canton and between Canton and Peking. There will no doubt be a similar exchange of information between the Colonial Office and Foreign Office.The existing Government at Peking has no authority or influence over affairs in Kwangtung.
Tung by Great Britain alone except at the risk of jeopardising our future economic relations with China. We are, however, of the opinion that it would be advantageous if very strong pressure could be brought to bear on the representatives in London of the Chief Maritime Powers with a view to joint action being taken at this juncture. The action which we suggest was outlined in my telegram of the 26th of January.(B.) Treatjr rights have, in fact, been violated in a flagrant manner, and the open door has, in fact, been closed against the British by Canton. The Government of Canton has definitely stated that they do not regard as valid what they call the &quot; Unequal Treaties.&quot; Until they were expelled by British troops, pickets of the Canton strikers invaded and occupied a district near Shataukuk, in the New Terri-tories. A police launch of the Colony has again and again been fired on in British water (the Shamchun river) by such pickets. a company of the Punjabi Regiment has also been fired on while patrolling the frontier near Takuling. In contravention of the joint working agreement, trains of the Kowloon-Canton Railway have been prevented from crossing the frontier in either direction. Villagers crossing the frontier have been waylaid by the pickets, who have levied toll on them. The importation of food-stuffs has also been prevented. On the 16th of July eight Chinese women bringing fruit into British territory from China were also fired on by pickets of strikers. Two of the women were killed and two were drowned. The pickets seized three a,nd sent them to Canton. The importation of British goods into Canton is entirely prevented by the Strike Committee, who enforce their prohibition by con-fiscating the goods. Cadman (a British subject), of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, was seized and thrown into prison by the Strike Committee. At the same time two Indian firemen were also seized, imprisoned for a considerable period and treated very brutally. At present an Indian Steamer guard is detained by the Committee in custody. Pickets are maintained round Shameen. Any articles carried to the British or French Concessions from the native City by any nationals are confiscated. Rules for Coastal Shipping (vide the 4th enclosure in the Governors Confidential despatch (3) of the 21st of August) are still vigorously maintained. Chinese are prevented (at Canton and Swatow) from intercourse with British subjects (not excluding the Consul-General or Consul) in any capacity. This is enforced by torture and death.   The following are the Treaties violated : Nanking Treaty (Articles 2, 5 and 10). Tientsin Treaty (Articles 11, 13, 14 and 18).The Government of Canton has neither prevented these contraventions of Treaties nor punished the parties guilty of contravention, in spite of the fact that not only has it been called upon to do so, but has at its disposal military forces adequate for the purpose. The. Strike Committee, on the contrary, is publicly recognised by the Canton Government as practically constituting a Government Department. More-over, assistance in picketing operations has been given by the Government to Canton Gunboats. The Canton Government is fully responsible for infractions of the law committed, by the Strike Committee. We consider emphatically that, having regard to the following facts, action should be taken under Article 7 of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty : 1. Trade with Canton is forbidden to British merchants.2. Other nationals are not so prevented, provided they do not deal with British goods.3. No facilities at Canton are allowed to British shipping.4. Facilities are not denied to the shipping of other nations, provided Hong Kong is avoided and British goods are not carried.(C.) Provided Admiral Li (who has 4 cruisers at his disposal) will undertake (1) to patrol the mouth of the West River and the Hainan Strait and (2) to take action against Chinese pirates, we favour the grant of assistance to the Chinese Navy. This subject is dealt with in my telegrams of the 6th of December and 19th of January and in my despatch of the 20th of January (Secret) and your telegram of the 30th of January.(D.) The suggestion that pressure should be brought to bear at Moscow. In our opinion the expulsion of the Bolsheviks from Canton is an essential preliminary to a permanent settlement. The possibility of the effective steps taken in 1923 (m regard to trawlers, &amp;c.) being repeated should be considered. If this were possible it might provide the solution of the Kuang Tung troubles without the use of force and without antagonising the Chinese.[14290] B 2
(E.) The question of conciliation. See enclosure 7 in Governor&apos;s Confidential despatch of the 2nd October, for the demands of Canton.The only body in Canton with which my Government can negotiate is the Government of Canton. Apart from Canton workmen (with whom the Colonial Government has no concern) the Strike Committee consists of former Hong Kong workmen (whose return we do not desire, since the Colony is better off without them). The advisers of the Committee are Red Russians. The Colonial Government cannot possibly conduct negotiations with such a body. If such negotiations were begun our prestige would suffer to such an extent that the future good Government of the Colony would be imperilled. Furthermore, a very detrimental effect would be produced on British interests in Shanghai if the Kuang Tung anti-British boycott were to end in the humiliation of the Colony or in any way (e.g., by the payment of blackmail in the guise of strike pay, by the reinstatement of strikers, or the payment of compensation for loss) which would enable the Government of Canton, the Strike Committee or the Red Russians to proclaim the settlement as a success. Moreover, such an ending would constitute a direct incitement to the renewal of anti-British agitation at Shanghai and in other places.Canton grievances. . In a communique to the Press (copy sent home with my secret despatch of the 28th of January) the (?) Commissary of Foreign Affairs has recently declared that the strike was begun by workers in the Colony, primarily as a protest against the British Government for the shooting which occurred on the 23rd of June at Canton, and not for economic reasons.Neither the strike nor the boycott which has followed it have been caused by any actions or neglect by the Colonial Government or the inhabitants of the Colony. Hong Kong is in advance of China in legislation for the benefit of labourers. Economically, workmen in the Colony are better off than in China It is decidedly my intention to exert my personal influence to induce the Government of Canton to turn for help to Britain rather than to Russia. In this connection I would refer you to my despatch of the 24th of December (Secret), paragraph 3, my despatch of the 8th of January (Secret), paragraph 2, and my despatch of the 20th of January (Secret), paragraph 10. We are, however, decidedly against an annual payment to Canton from Boxer funds. In the allocation of Boxer funds, in our opinion, no regard should be had to the Canton situation, and Kuang Tung should not receive any payment while the boycott lasts. Delegation should not, in our opinion, proceed to Canton, so long as relations between the Government of that place and Great Britain continue to be abnormal. We fear that there is no real desire for concilia-tion on the part of the Government of Canton, which is only inclined to put an end to the boycott on terms which would be humiliating to the Colony and Great Britain.A settlement would probably be welcomed by the bulk of. the population of Canton, but they are terrorised by the Strike Committee and are incapable of giving expression to their wishes. In Central and Northern China anti-British feeling has subsided, but as the result of Bolshevik influence over the Government of Canton, there has been no improvement in this respect in Kuang Tung. The suppression by the local Chinese Authorities of the extremist elements in Central and Northern China, has rendered possible there the realisation of the policy of conciliation.The Government in Kuang Tung, on the other hand, actually consists of the extremists.On the 4th of February I stated in the Legislative Council that the Government of Canton is expected and required by my Government to stop the illegal activities of the Strike Committee; that we consider that the responsibility rests on that Government, and that we are still willing to negotiate an honourable and permanent settlement with the Government of Canton. So far the Canton Government has declined to enter into negotiations. If they maintain this attitude in spite of my last offer, and should no success attend the action under the Washington Treaty which I have suggested, we shall have to consider whether the risk, involved in separate warlike action in Kuang Tung should not be taken. In the event of war becoming unavoidable I invite reference to my despatch of the 19th of January (Secret). We hope that in any statement which may be made in Parliament the suggestion in the last sentence of the telegram of the 1st of February from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking wall be emphasised.**       the patience of Ilis Majesty&apos;s Government, may at leng-tli be exhausted.
Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to theGovernor of Hong Kong.(Sent 45 p.m., March 4, 1926.)YOUR telegrams of the 26th J anuary and the 6th February have been carefully considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government, who have reached the following conclusions : (1.) Question of actual hostilities with Canton has not yet arisen. It is highly problematical whether on balance British interests would profit from hostilities, and in the circumstances and in view of attitude of other Powers it is clearly desirable that the question should not arise.(2.) Pressure on Moscow. I am sending you a despatch dealing generally with the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the Bolsheviks (see your secret telegram of the 13th January). Here I need only say that the general policy is to leave them alone and let&apos; them discredit themselves. Our. view is that us&quot;e of force would tend to prolong their influence and would merely aggravate position, and that the right course is to content ourselves with showing them up in their true colours whenever possible.(3.) League of Nations. It could hardly be expected that League would unanimously condemn the Canton Government without giving the latter a chance to be heard, and they would no doubt jump at the chance of entering into a public discussion about their grievances before representatives of all the nations of the world. Moreover, such discussion could hardly be confined to Canton question; the introduction of extraneous Chinese matters would be almost a certainty, and the situation would not be likely to be eased by the resulting publicity. It would in any case seem a hazardous course to bring so involved a question before an Assembly which is unfamiliar with the special conditions obtaining in China and the Far East, and it might well be that both His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Hong Kong Government would be highly embarrassed by the consequences. It must not be forgotten also that any such action would be tantamount to according the Canton Government some measure of international recognition, a proceeding which strikes us as undesirable at present. For these and other reasons His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that an appeal to the League would be inexpedient.(4.) Conciliation. So far as our information serves us, it would not appear that further efforts in this direction are likely to serve any useful purpose in existing circumstances.(5.) Assistance to anti-Communist leader. His Majesty&apos;s Government can see no element either in Kuang Tung or elsewhere the support of which would hold out any prospect of success. Moreover, the considered opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Governments advisers in China is to maintain policy of neutrality, and to reverse our policy in the face of this advice might entail gravest consequences.(6.) It would appear, therefore, that there is only one active policy remaining which merits further examination, namely, the question of organising an international counter-boycott against Canton. It is very doubtful, however, how far the various Powers, even if genuinely desirous of restraining their nationals, possess legal rights to do so, and apart from further reasons referred to below, it is clear that the proposal is open to serious difficulties,&quot; both practical and theoretical.His Majesty&apos;s Government fear, therefore, that they are forced to the conclusion that there is no alternative at present to a policy of peace and moderation. His Majesty&apos;s Government fully realise the grave difficulty and loss to which Hong Kong has been exposed, and will continue to investigate every possible line of action. I take this opportunity of assuring you that the tact and discretion which you have displayed are highly appreciated by His Majesty&apos;s Government and of conveying to you an expression of our satisfaction at the manner in which you, and, up to his departure, Fletcher have coped with a situation that is baffling in the extreme. Should any further courses of action suggest themselves to you I look to you to bring them to my notice the suggestion made in your telegram of the 26th February has been receiving consideration, but owing to divided attitude of Powers and to delicacy of Customs situation generally, I fear that there is little likelihood of its adoption.
