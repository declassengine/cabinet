[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]THE TAXATION OF MOTOR VEHICLES.Memorandum prepared by the Treasury and the Customs.Part I. The Previous Proposals.1. Proposals have already been approved by the Standing Committee on Expenditure, and in part also by the Cabinet, whereby the taxation of motor vehicles, instead of being fixed as at present on an arbitrary basis and paid wholly into the Road Fund, would in future be assessed and divided on two definite principles : (a.) That all classes of motor traffic should contribute to the Road Fund in accordance with the demands they make upon the roads.(b.) That, in addition, the Exchequer should be free to levy a luxury tax on the owners of pleasure cars and motor cycles.2. On this basis it was considered that the taxation of heavy motor vehicles might reasonably be increased by at least  2 millions, while approximately this amount of the proceeds of the taxation of cars and motor cycles might be transferred to the Treasury as a luxury tax and be supplemented by an additional  1-1 millions in taxation on the luxury basis.3. In the normal course the present basis of taxation was estimated to produce about  20 millions gross in 1926-27. The foregoing proposals would have raised the total to about  23^ millions, of which  3-1 millions would have gone to the Exchequer and the balance to the Road Fund. A further relief of  800,000 was to be obtained by charging against the Road Fund in future grants for unemployment road schemes on unclassified roads hitherto aided by the St. David&apos;s Committee.4. In addition to these proposals, it was agreed that, in view of the large balance accumulated in the Road Fund and the straitened condition of the national exchequer, a sum of  8 millions should be transferred to the Exchequer.  Apart from the change in the relative financial position of14430s
the Exchequer and the Road Fund, such a transfer may be defended on the following grounds : (i.) That in 1919 the State had made a grant of  8^ millions for theimprovement of roads, (ii.) That since the introduction of the new duties the State has made no reduction in the payments to local authorities through the Assigned Revenues System, although part of these revenues not earmarked to any particular service (now representing about  1,450,000 per annum) was given in substitution for the grant of half the cost of mam roads discontinued in 1888. (iii.) That, on the contrary, while leaving the field of motor taxation untouched for purposes of general revenue, the Treasury has provided additional subsidies for road purposes.Last Autumn the balance on the Road Fund at the 31st March, 1926, was expected to be  15J millions; it has proved to be  18f millions.5. Under these various proposals the total relief to the Exchequer in 1926-27 would have been about  12 millions, and in subsequent years about  4^ millions, rising with the growth of pleasure motor traffic.Part TL.-The Re-introduction of a Duty on Motor Spirit.6. The present system of taxation of motor vehicles by. registration licences was introduced in 1920 in place of the pre-war system of taxation of motor spirit. By that time the pre-war system had become utterly discredited owing to the uncontrollable system of rebates and the absence of any real definition of motor spirit, but its entire abandonment has alway been regarded by the private motorists as unjustifiable. A system of taxation irrespective of the amount of user is obviously open to grave objection from the point of view of equity, although every effort has been made to reduce the injustice by the introduction of quarterly and part year licences. The system is also open to criticism as tending to restrict the number of motor vehicles available for use and thereby to depress the market for second-hand cars.7. It has, however, proved so effective as a means of raising revenue, and the motor industry has expanded so rapidly under it, that these criticisms, weighty as they are, might well have been regarded as insufficient alone to justify an attempt to revert to the fuel duty basis, were it not for the importance of taking all possible steps to stimulate the production of liquid fuel from the coal supplies of this country. This development is urgently needed, both to reduce our&apos; growing dependence, economically and strategically, on supplies of imported fuel and also to re-establish the prosperity of our coal-mining industry.
8. Since the war considerable research has been carried out in this direction, but, although no process has as yet been proved to be commercially practicable, there can be no doubt that a duty on imported motor spirit, unaccompanied by any corresponding excise on spirit produced from home sources, would provide a powerful stimulus to further development. It should also tend to give a new lease of life to the Scottish shale oil industry, the one considerable home supply of heavy oil suitable for the Navy.9. The various administrative difficulties in the introduction of a duty on imported motor spirit are examined in Part III of this memorandum. In order to secure the necessary revenue, it is considered that.the duty should, be at the rate of 8d. a gallon and be introduced as from the 1st May, 1926, being applied by Budget resolution to stocks in the hands of importers, &amp;o, on that date, as well as to all subsequent imports. The necessary adjustments in the scales of registration licence duties and the incidence of the proposed taxation on the various classes of motorists are set out in Part IV of this Memorandum, while the effect of the new proposals on the finances of the Road Fund and the Exchequer respectively in 1926-27 is summarised in the concluding section.Part III. Duty on Motor Spirit.10. The proposed scheme of taxation includes a permanent Customs duty on motor spirit imported on and after the 1st May, 1926, and on motor spirit made from materials imported on and after the same date, and a non-recurrent Excise duty on stocks of motor spirit and crude oil, &amp;c, in the country on the 1st May, 1926, the amount of duty payable on the crude oil, &amp;c, being ultimately restricted to the quantity of motor spirit derived therefrom.Specification.11. The main difficulty in connection with schemes of this kind has been to find a satisfactory definition of the commodity to be taxed. This arises from the fact that crude petroleum is a mixture of a large number of hydrocarbons and is distilled into a number of different products, mainly distinguishable by the ranges of temperature within which they boil. But these ranges largely overlap, and, in particular, the boiling range of motor spirit overlaps to a large extent that of lamp oil. This leads to difficulty in attempting to frame a specification for taxation purposes aimed at isolating one or more of the petroleum products from the others, and, in particular, motor spirit from lamp oil. Another result which flows from the nature of petroleum products is the difficulty of framing a specification which the oil interests both here and abroad could not avoid by introducing mixtures outside the specification which would serve the purpose of motor spirit.
12. In the case of the motor-spirit duty in force from 1909 to 1920, the statutory definition of motor spirit for purposes of the duty was &quot; any inflammable hydrocarbon (including any mixture of hydrocarbons and any liquid containing hydrocarbon) which is capable of being used for pro-viding reasonably efficient motive power for a motor car,&quot; and the Customs were empowered to prescribe by regulations tests for the purpose of determining whether any inflammable hydrocarbon, or mixture of hydro-carbons, or liquid containing . hydrocarbon, was motor spirit within the meaning of this definition. In the event it proved impossible to devise any adequate test to apply to such a loose definition, and as time went on the position became more and more unsatisfactory. There is no doubt that much spirit capable of being used and actually used for the propulsion of motor cars escaped taxation.13. In connection with the Departmental Committee on the Taxation and Regulation of Road Vehicles, which considered, inter alia, the question of reviving a duty on motor spirit, various chemists attempted to devise a satisfactory specification without achieving success. In these circum-stances it was considered desirable, in connection with the recent enquiries, to appoint a Committee, presided over by the Government Chemist and including eminent scientists, to advise as to the practicability of devising a specification which would cover hydrocarbon oils normally used in the pro-pulsion of road vehicles in internal combustion engines whilst excluding lamp oil.14.   The specification proposed by this Committee is as follows : Duty shall be charged on distilled hydrocarbon oils and liquid containing distilled hydrocarbon oils (a) having 50 per cent, or more than 50 per cent, by volume distilling at a temperature not exceeding 185 degrees Centigrade, or (b) having 95 per cent, or more than 95 per cent, by volume distilling at a temperature not exceeding 240 degrees Centigrade, or (c) giving off. an inflammable vapour at a temperature of less than 22-8 degrees Centigrade (73 degrees Fahrenheit) when tested in the manner set forth in the Petroleum Acts. Turpentine to be excluded from duty.15. The Committee advise that this specification, whilst excluding lamp oil, would include all ordinary motor spirit, benzol, toluol, solvent naptha, white spirit, Admiralty vapourising oils, and certain power kerosenes, all of which it is practicable to use in road motors. The specification would also catch mixtures which might be imported in order to defeat the duty. It would be capable of interpretation both by Revenue Officers and traders with certainty and by means of a simple distillation test.
Form of the Duty.16. The precise forms of the Customs and Excise duties respectively are conditioned by the provisions of our Commercial Treaties. Under these Treaty obligations we are debarred from levying Excise duties on manufactures in this country from foreign materials, e.g., motor spirit made from imported crude petroleum, whilst allowing similar manufac-tures from British materials, e.g., motor spirit made from home-produced shale oil, to go free.17. In order to overcome Treaty difficulties, the permanent duty would be, in fact, a Customs duty on imported motor spirit and, in theory, a Customs duty at the same rate on imported hydro-carbon oils other than motor spirit.. The charge on the hydro-carbon oils would be adjusted by providing : (a.) That where the Customs were satisfied that such imported oils would not be treated for the purpose of the production of motor spirit, a rebate equal to the full amount of the duty should be allowed; and(&amp;.) That where such oils were removed to a bonded factory for the purpose of being so treated, a rebate should be allowed equal to the amount of duty payable on the difference between the quantity of hydro-carbon oils treated and the quantity of motor spirit produced therefrom.Thus heavy oils from which it was not intended to produce motor spirit would leave the ports free of duty and the remainder would pass to bonded factories and there pay duty only by reference to the quantity of motor spirit produced.18. The non-recurrent duty on stocks in this country on the 1st May, 1926, would be an Excise duty, since these stocks, having already been imported, could not be the subject of a Customs duty. Motor spirit made here from British shale oil and home-produced benzol and shale oil would be excluded from its scope, and in order not to contravene Treaty obligations the imported as well as the home-made article would be freed from duty in these cases. Stocks of imported benzol would be small in amount, and there are no imports of shale oil or spirit. It is also proposed to exempt white spirit, a turpentine substitute in the manufacture of paint, the stocks of which would in part be in the hands of builders&apos; merchants and would be entitled to rebate if shown to have been used for non-road purposes. This spirit, being fully capable of use in internal combustion engines, must be brought within the scope of the permanent duty, but stocks on the 1st May, 1926, would be comparatively small and the administrative difficulties of tracing and dealing with them would be out of all proportion to the slight risk run in ignoring them.14430 c
19. The question arises of how far down the chain of distribution the non-recurrent duty on stocks on the 1st May, 1926, would apply. The object would be to tax in any case stocks in the Oil Companies&apos; ocean and coastwise installations and at refineries, which represent about four-fifths of the total stocks held for sale in the country. It is doubtful if it would be possible to go further than this; users&apos; stocks would certainly require to be exempted.Rebates.20. Rebates of duty would be allowed to persons who use motor spirit for non-road purposes to the extent of not less than 80 gallons a year, repre-senting  1 in duty. In view of the fact that a considerable period would elapse between the date from which the duty took effect and the date of passing of the Finance Bill conferring the necessary powers to deal with it, the administration of rebates would necessarily be of a loose and provisional kind in the first few months of the duty. The proposal contemplated if it is found to be practicable is to introduce a permanent system on (say) the 1st October, 1926, under which all users of motor spirit for non-dutiable purposes would be required to apply to the Customs before that date stating the quantities required annually and the purposes for which it would be used. The Customs, if satisfied, would authorise the largest users to obtain duty-free supplies from a bonded installation, in which cases no question of repayment would arise, and would&apos; issue to the smaller users books of requisitions enabling them to purchase duty-paid motor-spirit from a dealer at a duty-free price up to the authorised quantity. In the latter cases the rebates would be paid periodically to the dealer on the basis of the requisitions handed to him by users.21. In the meantime, i.e., in the period up to the 30th September, 1926, arrangements would be made as far as possible to enable the largest users to obtain duty-free supplies. Where such arrangements were not made, consumers would have to obtain duty-paid supplies from dealers and subsequently claim rebate themselves, supporting their claims by receipts for purchases at a duty-paid price, and the Customs would have to check non-dutiable use of the motor spirit as best they could.Preference.22. As at present advised, it is not proposed to apply a preferential rebate to the Customs duty. Previous experience shows that rebates for non-dutiable use would in any case have to be paid at the full rate of duty. Moreover, when the motor spirit duty was previously in force, the Oil Companies preferred to pay at the full rate rather than be put to the inconvenience of keeping the necessary records, as it is impossible to have separate stocks of Empire and non-Empire spirit. The amount of Empire spirit is comparatively small. Empire imports in 1925 amounted to 25 million gallons out of a total importation of 404 million gallons of motor spirit, and to li million gallons out of a total importation of 563 million gallons of crude oil.
Part IV. The Adjustment of the Existing Scales of RegistrationLicence Duties.In a full year, on the basis of estimated consumption in 1926-7, a tax of Sd. a gallon on motor spirit woulcTproduce a revenue of nearly  16 millions. To raise the balance of the desired total revenue of  23! millions, rather more than  7^ has to be found from registration duties. Of this amount  3-1 millions to be allocated to the Exchequer would be levied as a luxury tax, while the  4 millions for the Eoad Fund should have reference to road user. The following scales have been prepared on this basis : Motor Cycles and Cars. Cycles.	Present Duty:&quot;	Proposed Duti		es.		To Eoad Fund.	To Exchequer.

In each case the price of petrol is assumed to be raised by %d. a gallon to the consumer : Miles.Heavy motor-cvcle with side-car ... 4,000Morris-Cowley, 11-9 h.p.          ... ... 5,600Talbot Darracq, 17-9 h.p..... ... 5,300Ford, 22-4 h.p.           ...         ... ... 6,500Rolls-Royce, 49 h.p.     ...         ... ... 3,4001 ton Ford van          ...          ... ... 4,7003-4 ton lorry ...          ...          ... ... 3,700London omnibus         ...          ... ... 10,000London taxicab          ...         ... ... 4,700
A rough estimate of the distribution of the present total petrol consumption indicates a probable average annual mileage of about 4,000 for cycles and cars, 8,000 for commercial goods vehicles, and 10,000 for hackney vehicles. It should, however, be emphasised that these are only average figures and very rough estimates. In each class wide ranges of mileage will be found. Probably the highest mileages are reached by the omnibuses; the London General Omnibus Company averaging roughly 35.000 miles for each vehicle per annum. On this basis the total taxation for one of the largest types of omnibus would amount to about  206 per annum at the new rates as compared with the present  84 per annum. Such an increase, though entirely justified by the enormous use made of the roads, would probably lead to some readjustment of fares, but as the increase in taxation would still be only about 3 per cent, of running expenses, the increases in fares ought not to be general or considerable, particularly in view of the tendency to reduce the number of vehicles on the streets by regulation, thereby increasing the earning capacity of those remaining.The total taxation payable by each class of vehicle in a full year under the new scales of registration licence duties and the petrol duty respectively is estimated on the basis of 1926-27 roughly as follows : To Road I    Fund.

Estimated Financial Effect of the New Scheme in 1926-27.The yield in 1926-27 of the petrol duty operating from the 1st May next is estimated at  13 millions. In view of the stocks of duty-free petrol still available on that date it is proposed that the reduced scale of registration licence duties should not come into operation until the 1st July next and that the licences granted thereafter should expire at the end of February 1927, or at the end of any three-monthly period before that (i.e., the 31st August and the 30th November). It would be necessary after the 1st July to repay to persons then holding licences on the old basis valid for the remainder of the calendar year, the difference between the unexpired value of the old licence to the 31st December, 1926, and the cost of a new licence to the 28th February, 1927. This is estimated to cost  3 millions and is balanced by the receipts in the quarter to the 30th June, 1926, under the existing basis of taxation.
The financial statement for the year 1926-27 would thus work out as follows : Revenue. ^Yield of petrol duty ...      .:.      ...      .........      13-0Yield of old licence duties for quarter to 30.6.1926, lessnet repayment for remainder of the year    ...       ...        0- new duties taken out in March 1927      ...       ...       .....4-5Miscellaneous receipts        ...      ...      ... ...        1-0Total Revenue ......       ......      18-7Amount payable to Exchequer in respect of luxury duties        5-2 .Net payment into Road Fund ...       ...       ...       ...      13-5Estimated expenditure of Road Fund, 1926-27     ...      22-0Deficit .........      ......        8-5This deficit is mainly the result of the change over of system from one in which about two-thirds of revenue due in respect of a calendar year is received in the first quarter of the year, i.e., in the last quarter of a financial year, to one in which the bulk of the revenue is spread over the year according to consumption. The present basis leads to balances at the 31st March being inflated by about  7 millions and on the change of system it is considered that they may be properly drawn upon to finance the change This would reduce the free balance as at 1st instant to  10-2 millions.As the Treasury would be receiving about  6 millions from the new luxury duties and the relief from the St. David&apos;s Committee grants combined, it is proposed only to draw  6 millions instead of  8 millions from the balances, thus making the aggregate relief in 1926-27  12 millions as previously contemplated.
