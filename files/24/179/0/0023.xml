3x3supposing that future improvements in mining practice will improve the competitive position of the British coal industry,  since progress is  the monopo.lv of no one country,(5) It is necessary to emphasise this view,  since It closely affects the economic position upon which the Commission ask the exporting districts to rest when the subvention ceases on the 1st May.(6) Briefly stated the suggestion of the Commission Is that in these districts a reduction in wages of the order of 10 per cent,  on the one hand and increase in the existing average sailing price of about 2/- per ton (or about 15 per cent.) on the other,  should enable the proceeds from the sale of coal to balance the costs of production,  and that the  districts must rely f*r any profits on the fixture effects of their re-organlsa-tion proposals,,(?)  Such a position is one which it is quite impossible to contemplate without the gravest apprehension, having regard to the following considerations  &quot;.-(a) In the first place an increase in prices of the kind suggested would undoubtegll^ghave a disastrous effect on the volume of exports/and result in colliery stoppages on a large scale.(b) In the second place it must be realised that all of the exporting districts have been bearing the burden of losses on working over the whole period from the 1st May,  1924, to the 31st December,  1925,  even when the amounts received as Government subvention are taken int&apos;u account.(c) In the third place,  as already indicated,   the benefits to be obtained from the re-organisation proposal are,  in the opinion of the owners,  largely illusory.(8) Bearing in mind the financial straits to which twoyears af unprofitable working have Already reduced the collier-lea,it is impossible to regard these proposals as furnishing thebasis of a practicable solution of the problem facing theindustry at the 1st May,
3x3supposing that future improvements in mining practice will improve the competitive position of the British coal industry,  since progress is  the monopolv of no one country,(5) It is necessary to emphasise this view,  since it closely affects the economic position upon which the Commission ask the exporting districts to rest when the subvention ceases on the 1st May.(6) Briefly stated the suggestion of the Commission is that in these districts a reduction in wages of the order of 10 per cent,  -m the one hand and Increase in the existing average sailing price of about 2/- per ton (or about 15 per cent.) on the other,  should enable the proceeds from the sale of coal te balance the costs of production,  and that the districts must rely far any profits on the fixture effects of their re-organlsa-tion proposals.(?)  Such a position is one which it is quite impossible to . contemplate without the gravest apprehension, having regard to the following considerations   :-(a) In the first place an increase in prices of the kind suggested would undoubtedd^ghave a disastrous effect on the volume of export /and result in collier;&apos;&apos; stoppages on a large scale.(b) In the second place it must be realised that all of the exporting districts have been bearing the burden of losses on working over the whole period from the 1st May,  1924, to the 31st December,  1925,  even when the amounts received as Government subvention are takenint^ account.(c) In the third place,  as already Indicated,   the benefits to be obtained from the re-organisation proposal are,  in the opinion of the owners,  largely illusory.(8) Bearing in mind the financial straits to which twoyears af unprofitable working have Already reduced the collieries,it is impossible to regard, these proposals as furnishing, thebasis of a practicable solution of the problem facing theindustry at the  1st May,
(9) The only two alternatives, Indeed, would be nage reductions greater than it would be possible to suggest to the workmen, or a volume of unemployment greater than the Industry has yet experienced.(10) The members of the Commission, reluctant though they were to recommend an extension of hours, recognisedthat in the last resort this was the onlv escape from the dilemma, and on page 178 they remark&quot;It is at least possible, though we hope not probable that the amount of wage reduction or the alternative of unemployment that will be imposed upon the industry if it Is to continue with the present hours, may be such as to lead the miners to consider whether they should not escape from these troubles by some extension of working hours.     If the Miners&apos; Federation flame forward with such a request,,, it would be difficult to argue that the State should refuse it,&quot;(11) The Associatien feel  hat the ohapter in which the Commission deal with the question of hours is the least convincing section of the Report.(12) The fear of increased output which thev express is obviously an argument which could be adduced against any proposal for Increasing productivity, e.g. by the Increased use of machinery, and does not take account of the fact that even if it were conceded that the whole of the Increased output could not be at once disposed of, reduction of costs of production is in any event the pre-requisite to recovery.(13) Again in dealing with possible repercussions abroad, the Commission appear to treat the matter as if it were necessarily a case of proposing longer hours than those worked abroad, and they further emit to discuss in relation to the question of hours the fact that the rates
of wages paid in the ooal industry, in European competing countries, fall below those in this country by amounts much, greater than before the war,(14)    The significance of these two points Is brought out prominently in the case cf the Ruhr district of Germany, our principal competitor, where the wages cost of production is lower by 5/- per ton than in this country..(15)      It appears from the Report that in considering how far an adjustment of hours of working might be regarded as a possible direction in. which relief might be sought the Commission were to some extent influenced by the knowledge that opposition to an extension of hours was part of the official policy of the Miners.&apos;  Organisations..(16)    The Association freely recogni.se that this was a consideration which was bound to have weight with them... On the other hand, the Association would urge the members of H.M.Government to b*3ar carefully in mind that there is a large body of opinion among the mining population, which&apos;fully realises that an extension of hours is. a less evil than the more severe reductions in wages.which are inevitable under the existing hours of working..(17).   In this connection the Association would point out that the first  sentence of the passage quoted above from page 1Y8 cf the Report hardly conveys with accuracy the nature of the action which it would fall to the Government to unuertake.      It is not a question of the State making any change of working hours or endeavouring
to force upon the miners a longer working day. All that is implied in the action which the Association would urge upon H..M. Government to take is that the further restriction upon working hours imposed by the Act of 1919 should be removed so as to leave the parties free within the limits imposed by the Act of 1908 to negotiate     among themselves adjustments of the present conditions to meet the requirements of the various Districta.      Such adjustments are contemplated by the Commission themselves on page 175 of the lie port.(18)    The Association have felt it necessary to refer at length to tho quest ion of hours of work, as the findings of the Report serve if anything to strengthen rather than weaken their conviction that no practicable solution of the coal problem can be i-reached without dealing with this aspect of it.(19)    It is proposed that representatives of the coal owners should invite representatives of the miners2 national organisation to meet them forthwith to consider the situation in the light of the Report of the Commission,      The efforts of the owners will be directed towards securing working arrangements which will enable the industry in each district to operator on an economic basis after the 1st May,-5-
and towards establishing machinery which would permit of the local autonomy which is necessary to provide for the variations in conditions arising from time to time in the ^ififrent districts.(20)     Bearing in mind the sis Suggestions which the Commission mate on pages 229/30 of the Report, the owners have decided that in order to remove any possible obstacles to the progress of negotiations for an immediate settlement they will make an intimation to the miners1  representatives in the sense of the third paragraph of this memorandum.      They have, however, felt it necessary at the. outset to make    it clear to the    Government their general- position and in particular to avoid coxiveying, the false impression that their remarks on the proposals relating to the future of the industry are to be understood as indicating that &apos; they regard these as materially affecting the position,-6-
While, as i 1 ready indicated, a final pronouncement upon the Commission-Ts   ropcsals generally is not possible at the moment3  the owners desire to bring before the Government at the earliest possible moment their views upon certain (5f the prcpasals in respect of which legislative action is recommended,,The owners- view with the gravest apprehension the proposal that the State should acquire the minerals and should he endowed with powers ox interference with the structure and the conduct of the    industry by virtue of its position a s mine ral c emer BThey would urge that in the short ohapter of the Report dealing with royalties there is n^ effective answer to the ease against nationalisation which was presented in the evidence of the Mineral Owners and of the Mining iissoeiation, or to the submission that an extension of the previsions of The Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act,, 1923. provides a simple and adequate method of dealing with such difficulties as occur under the system of private ownership cIt would,  indeed, appear that the main consideration by which the commission were influenced in arriving at their decision was the alleged, &quot;resentment among the miners at a charge being levied upon the fruits of their labour for the advantage of individuals in return for which in their capacity as owners neither work nor enterprise has usually been given on their part&quot;.Even if such resentment - did in fact exist among the mining population - it may be pointed out that in not proposing confiscation without compensation in accordance with the policy
of the Miners&apos; federation but virtually placing the State in the position of an intermediary receiving the royalty charge with the one hand and making payment to ,the late royalty owners with the other,  the Commission do not materially alter the position in this respect *It may further be pointed cut that in so far as mining properties would fall into, the hauls of the State on the expiration of leases the State itself would become tfro owner of mines and that to  this extent  the proposal for the national!-sation of minerals is in conflict with the Commission&apos;s condemnation of nationalisation of the industry.The Association would add  that they think it unfortunate that the Commission quote views expressed on the subject by the signatories of one  of the reports of the Coal Industry Commission in 1919 without at the same time referring  to the evidence given before them as to the changing view of certain of the gentlemen and the reasons therefor.The Association trust that the Government will realise that the subject is ene of such far-reaching importance as to merit Itself a special inquiry in much greater detail than was possible for the Royal Commission on the Coal industry, having regard to the limited time at their disposal and the wide ground which they had to cover, before the country is committed to such a drastic proposal gravely affsoting the basal industry -of o oal production, PIT COMMITTEESaThe owners welcome the reference which the Commission make to the undesirability of substituting compulsory arrange-ments for  the long-established machinery which&apos; exists in the coal industry for discussions between representatives of the employers1  and the miners1  organisations.
As regards the suggestion that statutory provision should he made for the constitution of pit committees the owners feel that the Commission may not have fully appreciated the extent to which provision is already made,  formally or informally, for discussions between, the management and representatives of the workers at the pit, though it is observed that  they were impressed during their visits to the coal fields by the good relationship which existed between management and workers..The ewners would strongly urge that if, as recommended by the Commission, it is considered desirable to give a more definite form to the arrangements for consultation between the management and the men by the constitution of formal pit. committees this should be left to the industry itself as they are convinced that it will be possible to make the necessary arrangements on a voluntary basis and to produce much more satisfactory results than would be possible under any attempt to secure the same results by compulsory methods,, GCMPULSORY PEPffIT-SHOEING- SCHEMES,,The owners have already indicated in evidence before the-Commission that they are entirely In sympathy with the principle of bringing the individual worker into close relationship with the success of his own concern and they are prepared to give the matter their close attention with a view te the encouragement of the adoption of schemes suited to the particular circumstances of individual undertakings and having for their object  the interesting of the workers in tho success of the undertaking in which they are employed-.Apart altogether j however, from the question whether legis-lation of the kind suggested by the Commission with a view to the compulsory establishment of profit-sharing schemes would be acceptable to the workers,  the Association are convinced
that it is impossible to lay down any lines for the establishment  of  schemes which-would be of general application and they would urge that this is essentially a matter for voluntary action. COMPULSORY AMALGAMATION OP UILDEkTAICEEGS.The owners agree with the opiUioh expressed by the Commission that any general measure of compulsory amalgamation on arbitrary lines would be mischievous, -and that, each case must be treated individuallyo    They would urge, indeed,  that good results can only be secured from voluntary amalgamation. The matter is one which will receive their careful attention, and although the legislation which the Commission propose is limited in scope and not cf immediate application they would represent strongly that no action of this kind should be taken at the present time, since it will only increase the uncertainty as to the future which is one of the most serious difficulties of colliery operation without conferring any corresponding benefit.sj Whit eha11 Cardens,  S.W.I.
