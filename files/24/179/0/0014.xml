TO^DOQUMINT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITA1TI-TIC majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET,.CAMHBTvc.p. 114(26). gigpORT^Fjiffi royal^commision^oj&quot; OH TILE Ca^IHQUIHY.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Transport.As the Secretary for Mines points out in his&apos; Memorandum, CP.106(26), Chapter IX of the Report advocates improvements in railway transport, e.g. by a greater measure of standardisation of wagons, an increased provision of wagons of larger capacity, and an extension of the principle of common user. In order to secure progress on these lines the Commission make three specific suggest ions:-(a)    That a Standing Joint Committee of the Ministry of Transport and the Mines Department, including representatives of the railway companies, mine owners and merchants,  should be set up with the detailed functions mentioned in the Report,  and should report to Parliament annually,I see no reason why this recommendation should notbe accepted, so far a3 the Government is concerned, butit appears to me that it would   be more in accordance withpractice that the Reports of any such Standing JointCommittee should he made not to Parliament but to theMinister of Transport, who should lay the Report beforeParliament., (b)    That the appropriate Department should be given power to make regulations fox the standardisation of wagons, on the recommendations of the Standing Joint Committee,The Commission appears to have been unaware orimperfectly informed of my powers under Section 16 of theRailways Act, 1921, to make Orders on the railway companies,subject to certain limitations, with a view to the gradualstandardisation of equipment, and also of the powers ofthe railway companies under Sections 117 and llS of theRailways Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, to make
17tlwMaroh. 1926regulations as to the construct ion of wagons used, on railways,      Theae powers are of wide scope, legislation to amend them might &quot;be controversial, and I am not convincedth&amp;t it is necessary.     If it should prove desirable, I see no objection to its introduction.(c)   That if legislation is necessary to enable railway companies to give effect to the Commission&apos;s recommenda-tions for preferential rates on large capacity and common user wagons, it should be passed.Railway Companies are at present able, subject tothe Hates Tribunal, to give exceptional rates in circumstances where they are economically justified andI see no necessity for legislation.(intd.)
