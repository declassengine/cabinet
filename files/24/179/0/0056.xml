Paper No. 676-B.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report by the Principal Supply Officers&apos; Committee containing recommendations for the support of the Optical Glass and Optical Instrument Industries (C.I.D. Paper No. 676-B).SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER said that a Board of Trade Committee had had under consideration the industries concerned with the manufacture of the goods comprised within the. Schedule to the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921, with a view to determining if it was desirable that the protection afforded by Part I of the Act in respect of those industries should be continued after the expiry of the Act in August next. The Report of this Committee was now ready, and the recommendations would shortly be considered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and himself, and circulated to the Cabinet in due course. In point of fact, the Committee had recommended that the whole of the provisions of Part I of the Safeguarding of Industries Act should be retained, and that, as regards optical instruments, the duty should be raised to 50 per cent., but he suggested that the detailed consideration of the Principal Supply Officers&apos; Report should be postponed until the Report of the Board of Trade Committee had been circulated.SIR NOEL BIRCH said he had nothing to add to the Report beyond emphasising the gravity of the present situation of the industries from the point of view of national preparedness for defence.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the Report was outside the scope of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and suggested that it should be accepted in principle and submitted to the Cabinet.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed To recommend the Principal Supply Officers&apos; Report on the Optical Glass and Optical Instrument Industries (C.I.D. Paper No. 676-B) for the consideration of the Cabinet, who would be advised by the Departments concerned.*****2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, March 29, 1926.[14369-4]

March 1926.SECRET.Copy No.C.I.D. 676-B.(Also P.S.O. 98.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.OPTICAL GLASS AND OPTICAL INSTRUMENT INDUSTRIES. (Previous C.I.D. Papers Nos. 531-B and 60S-B.)REPORT OF PRINCIPAL SUPPLY OFFICERS&apos; COMMITTEE.THE Principal Supply Officers&apos; Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Prime Minister, have considered a letter from the Admiralty to the Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence, in which it was requested that the serious position of the British optical industry as regards the production both of optical glass and of instruments required for national defence purposes might be brought to the notice of the Committee of Imperial Defence (C.T.D. Paper No. 608-B, also P.S.O. Paper2. After a preliminary survey of the situation in its more general aspects, we agreed to refer the detailed examination of the question to a small ad hoc Sub-Committee composed of representatives of the three Services and of the Board of3. It will be remembered that in our Second Annual Report (C.I.D. Paper No. b&apos;33-B, paragraph 6, also P.S.O. Paper No. 65) we referred to an Interim report-t which we had received from our Sub-Committee, in which it had been suggested that it would be helpful if a statement, signed by the Director of Scientific Research and approved by the Admiralty, were to be issued to the Press, to the pffect that the Admiralty had found from experience that optical glass and instruments supplied by British firms were as good as, and often better than similar articles manufactured abroad. We mentioned that, we had agreed with this proposal, that we had asked the Admiralty to act upon it, and that we intended to invite the War Office and Air Ministry to issue statements on similar lines at later, and appropriate intervals. We are glad to be able to report that statements have now been issued to the Press by all three Services.4. In our Second Annual Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 633-B, also P.S.O. Paper No. 65) we also referred to the fact that we had instructed our Sub-Committee to invite representatives of the leading optical glass and optical instniment firms to meet them, in order to discuss the causes of the depression of the industry and its possible remedies. The meeting duly took place, and it enabled our Sub-Committee to obtain an inside knowledge, not only of present trade conditions, but also of the measures which the representatives of the trade advocate for the amelioration of those conditions. Armed with this knowledge, our Sub-Committee furnished us with a comprehensive report.5. We have examined this report, which we attach herewith, and we desire to make the following observations in regard to it. The bulk of the recommendations put forward by our Sub-Committee raise issues which are clearly outside the scope of our Committee. At the same time we are impressed with the gravity of the present position. We consider it essential, from the point of view of national preparedness for defence, that the maintenance of the Optical Glass and Optical Instrument Industries should be ensured. -We are satisfied that this cannot be effected by the Service Departments alone, and that it is a question of general Government policy. In these circumstances, we have come to the conclusion that a report confined to mattersNo. 56).Trade.-[14313]b
strictly within the scope of our Committee would be of little worth; and we agree with the course adopted by our Sub-Committee of going further afield in the search for possible remedies. We consider that some measures, not less far-reaching than those advocated by our Sub-Committee, are essential to the preservation of the industries, and we therefore forward the Report as it stands for the consideration of the Committee of Imperial Defence. In doing so, we desire to make it clear that the variouB Government Departments, such as the Treasury, the Board of Education, &amp;c, which are cloaely concerned, have not yet been consulted as to the feasibility of the recommendations contained in the Report.(Signed on behalf of the Committee),(Signed) NOEL BIRCH, Chairman,Principal Supply Officers&apos; Committee.

3. Early in our deliberations it became apparent that neither could we satisfactorily determine the nature, the extent, nor the causes of the depression, unless we obtained inside knowledge of present trade conditions; nor could we formulate definite recommendations for remedial measures, unless we were assured that those recommendations would not be received with hostility by the trade. We therefore suggested that representatives of the leading firms might be invited to meet us informally, in order that we might ascertain their point of view. This suggestion was approved by the Principal Supply Officers&apos; Committee at their 17th Meeting, on the understanding that we should in no way commit ourselves, or any Department, to any form of assistance.4. Invitations to attend an informal conference were sent to the following firms : Messrs. Chance Bros., Ltd.Messrs. Adam Hilger, Ltd.Messrs. Barr and Stroud, Ltd.Messrs. Taylor, Taylor and Hobson, Ltd.Messrs. Aldis Bros.Messrs. R. and J. Beck, Ltd.Parsons Optical Glass Company.5. The following representatives attended a Meeting which was held on the .10th July, 1925 :-Sir Charles Parsons, representing Parsons Optical Glass Company.Sir Howard Grubb, Parsons and Company.Messrs. Ross, Ltd.Dr. Barr, representing Messrs. Barr and Stroud.Mr. Stobart, representing Messrs. Chance Bros.Mr. Taylor, representing Messrs. Taylor, Taylor and Hobson.Mr. Beck, representing Messrs. R. and J. Beck.Mr. Twyman, of Messrs. Adam Hilger, Ltd., was unable to attend, butsubmitted his views in writing. Sir Herbert Jackson (representing the British Scientific Industrial ResearchAssociation) was also present.6. This meeting served to throw considerable fresh light on the condition of the industry and the causes of the depression, but it revealed to us the fact that the trade representatives were by no means unanimous in their views as to the methods of support which would be of most value to the industry as a whole. We therefore suggested that they should further discuss this aspect of the subject among them-selves, with a view to arriving at some definite and unanimous proposals, and that they should then advise us of those proposals.7. Our suggestion was acted upon, and we eventually received a comprehensive memorandum, signed by all the representatives except Mr. Beck, whose minority report does not materially Affect the principles at issue. This memorandum is attached as an Appendix to this Report. We examined the proposals contained therein, in conjunction with various other proposals which had come to our notice in the course of our official and unofficial enquiries, and we formulated our -conclusions.8. Before setting forth our definite recommendations,&apos; however, it appears desirable to direct attention to those points wnich seem to us to throw the clearest light on the extent and nature of the present depression, and on the causes of that depression, in order that its relation to national defence may be apparent, and that the motif of those measures which we recommend for its revival may be the more readily understood. We have therefore drawn up a summary of the present position, based on (i.) The memorandum submitted by the trade representatives, (ii.) The memorandum entitled &quot;Position of the Optical Industry&quot; (OLD. Paper No. 608-B) (P.S.O. Paper No. 56). (iii.) Information which has come to our notice in the course of this enquiry.Summary of Present Position.9.  (i.) The Optical Industry is a relatively small industry, whose profits cannot, even under the best conditions, be large.   It has exhausted its reserves of
capital, and is at present going through a period of great depression. Three firms have already gone into liquidation, and unless help is given others must follow. The position is therefore critical.(ii.) The three important branches of the industry that it is essential to keep going are &quot;Photographic apparatus, Microscopes and Binoculars.&quot; These are branches which normally might be regarded as not essential to the Services, but they form the bulk of peace-time production and would form the reserves in time of war, of plant, equipment and skilled men.(iii.) There is practically no manufacture of optical instruments anywhere within the Empire except in Great Britain.(iv.) The Industry has only a part of its Home market, and a relatively small Empire trade. This is partly attributable to the generally held, though erroneous, belief in the inferiority of British to foreign products, and partly to the fact that in many lines of work it is underbidden by foreign manufacturers. In this latter connection it may here be noted how profitable it is for many foreign manufacturers to supply optical instruments to this country. The reason lies in the fact that the overhead charges of the industry, including as they do large expenditures on com-putation and optical design, skilled testing, assembly and adjustment, and, in a few cases, on research and experiment, are extraordinarily heavy. In normal times these overhead charges entail an addition of 100 per cent, to the total cost of wages and material, and at the present time they entail an addition of approximately 200 per cent. In addition, the discounts given to merchants are exceptional. The retail dealer takes from one-third to one-half of the retail price; the wholesale dealer up to 60 per cent, of the retail price.The foreign manufacturer has a large home market. It therefore pays him to expand his output, to spread his overhead charges over such larger output, and to sell in this country what he cannot sell elsewhere, especially as he can employ for his larger output economical methods of quantity production which are impossible for the British manufacturer, whose market is more restricted.(v.) At the present time the demand for British goods is particularly small, for the following reasons : (a.) The stocks held by the Service Departments at the end of the war so greatly exceeded their reduced requirements on a peace basis that those Depart-ments are unable to place large orders with the trade.(b.) Similarly, the requirements of private purchasers are still being largely met by articles which have been sold as surplus war stores.(c.) The amount of imports has, in recent years, been very considerable, and especially so in the first years after the passing of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, when the German exchange was very low.(vi.) Owing to lack of orders, the number of sufficiently highly skilled men at present employed in optical work is already quite inadequate to ensure the rapid expansion of production which a national war would necessitate, and this number is being still further reduced. In this connection it is desirable to stress the fact that expansion of production by the optical instrument trade is, relative to other trades, exceedingly slow. This is due to the fact that, owing to the exceptional degree of accuracy which is essential, mechanical methods of production are too inaccurate for a large portion of the work, and this has to be done by very highly skilled men. The case of &quot;flat workers &quot; may be quoted as illustrative of the present position and its bearing on potential expansion of production. It is estimated that, in the event of war, at least 100 &quot;flat workers &quot; would be necessary. The number of such men at present employed is 40, and this number is being still further reduced. It takes about 3 years for a suitable man to develop sufficient skill for this work, and, even if men who have been skilled as &quot;flat workers &quot; could be recovered from other occupa-tions, some time must elapse before &quot; touch &quot; for such work returns to them. To sum lip under this head, expansion of production was very slow in 1914. The position to-day is considerably worse than it was then.(vii.) The orders of the Service Departments alone are insufficient to secure the maintenance of the Industry. It is therefore necessary that in normal times the Industry should be employed on civil work on such a scale that the requisite expansion of production of war work is assured. In this connection attention is invited to sub-paragraph (ii) above.(viii.) The Germans are making a determined effort to capture the British market, and bankrupt the British industry by underselling, by propaganda and by various insidious methods.[14100] b 3
Conclusions.10. In view of the facts set forth in the foregoing summary of the position, we consider that the first essential towards the revival of the British industry is increase of sales; and we suggest that this can, in some measure, be secured by checking the import of foreign goods into this country and the Dominions. To this end we consider that the rate of duty should be raised to a figure not less than the largest rate at which such duty is levied by any other country. We have learned that this is 45 per cent. by America.We therefore recommend &quot; (i.) That, on the expiry of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, future legislation should provide for the import duty on optical glass and optical instruments to be increased to 45 per cent.&quot; (ii.) That it should be stipulated in such legislation that funds required to subsidise the Optical Glass and Optical Instrument Industries (see para-graphs 16 and 17) should be the first charge against money obtained from this duty.&quot;11. We consider that a serious effort should be made to secure the protection of the Optical Industry by all Governments in the Empire; and we therefore recommend &quot; That the Dominions Office should be asked to approach the Dominion Governments with a view to their imposing an enhanced duty on imports of optical goods of foreign manufacture.&quot;12. It has come to our notice that foreign-made optical goods can be shipped to one of the Colonies, and then, with the expenses of boxing, shipping and selling added, can be counted as Colonial products and admitted into this country without restriction; and this, despite the fact that only 25 per cent, of the total cost is expended in the Colony. We consider that steps should be taken to restrict the admission as Imperial products of goods which are, in fact, made in substantial part in foreign countries. In this matter Australia has adopted a limiting percentage of 75 per cent., and New Zealand is about to adopt a limiting percentage of 50 per cent.  We recommend &quot; That the &apos; limiting percentage &apos; for the classification of goods as Imperial products should be 75 per cent, of factory cost.&quot;13. In connection with the recommendations contained in paragraphs 10, 11 and 12, the trade representatives have stated that the Industry has exhausted its reserves of capital; that fresh capital will have to be found for development; and that such capital will not be forthcoming except on the specific assurance that any special protection that may be granted will be continued for a least five years. We are in sympathy with this condition, but we realise that no definite assurance on these lines is possible. We desire, however, to place on record our recommendation  &quot; That every reasonable expectation of continuity for at least five years ofthe protection afforded, by the legislation recommended in paragraphs 10, 11and 12 should be given to the Industry.&quot;14. It was suggested to us that it might be expedient to recommend an export bounty as a means of fostering the trade. We discussed this proposition with the trade representatives, and came to the conclusion that it was preferable that Govern-ment support should take the form of an increased duty on import rather than of a bounty on export.15. The trade representatives have urged that the Service Departments should expedite the placing of their orders, and that they should considerably augment those orders. This laying in of reserves, including Optical Glass, would afford a measure of immediate support to the industry, and would ensure a proportion of the requisite quantities of material being immediately available to the Services in the event of war, but we are not in a position to say whether this is a practicable solution of the problem.  In these circumstances we can only record a recommendation &quot; That it should be brought to the notice of the Service Departments thatthe expedition of placing of their orders, and the augmentation of those orders,would be a valuable step towards the revival of an industry which is vital totheir efficiency in war.&quot;
16. We had under consideration a suggestion that grants should be made for the jDurchase of optical instruments for educational work on the condition that the instruments so purchased should be wholly of British manufacture. We warmly support this suggestion, both from the point of view of the support which its adoption would afford to the Optical Industry, and from the point of view of the educational benefits that would accrue.We accordingly recommend &quot; (i.) That for the first year a grant of  20,000 should be made for the purchase of optical instruments for educational work; and that grants for subsequent years should be considered in one year&apos;s time.(ii.) That it should be a stipulation of this grant that the whole of the instruments purchased therewith should be wholly of British manufacture.&quot; (iii.) That the grant should be administered by the Board of Education.&quot; (iv.) That the expenditure involved should, in conjunction with the expenditure involved by a grant for development work (see paragraph 17) be: the   first   charge   against   money   obtained   from   the   import   duty   (see paragraph 10).&quot;17.   We have already directed attention to the following facts :  (i.) The overhead charges of the industry are exceptionally heavy, (ii.) The Industry is relatively a small one. (iii.) The Industry has exhausted its reserves of capital.We consider it essential that development of the industry should be encouraged, and we consider that encouragement should take-the form of an annual subsidy. Accordingly we recommend &quot; (i.) That, for the first year, a grant of  10,000 should be provided for the encouragement of development of the Optical Glass and Optical Instruments industries; and that grants for subsequent years should be considered in one year&apos;s time.&quot; (ii.) That the expenditure involved should, in conjunction with expendi-ture involved in the recommendation contained in paragraph 16 above, be the first charge against money obtained from the import duty (see paragraph 10).&quot;18. The trade representatives have submitted that, in order to uphold the reputation of British optical instruments, the National Physical Laboratory should issue certificates regarding them at greatly reduced fees. We desire to support this proposal.   We therefore recommend &quot; That, in order to uphold the&apos; reputation of British Optical Glass and Instruments, and at the same time afford to these Industries a much-needed measure of financial relief, the National Physical Laboratory should issue certificates regarding British products at greatly reduced fees.&quot;19. Our examination of the general position and activities of the British industry has led us to the conclusion that British firms are, generally speaking, lacking in enterprise in the sphere of business management. We attribute this state of affairs partly to lack of capital, and partly to lack of combination. We consider that a combined Sales Agency would fend to eliminate jealousy and &quot; cut-throat &quot; competition amongst the smaller firms, and to stimulate business enterprise. We therefore recommend &quot;That the advantages of a Combined Sales Agency should be brought to the notice of those Government Departments which are entrusted with the administration of any grants which may be given to the Industry.&quot;20. In connection with the above we had under consideration a proposal for the amalgamation of firms; but the objections urged by the trade representatives were of such a nature, and raised such wide and controversial issues, that we do not feel competent to advise on this proposal.Summary of Recommendations.21. (1.) (a.) That, on the expiry of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, future legislation should provide for the import duty on Optical Glass and Optical Instruments to be increased to 45 per cent.

APPENDIX. [P.S.O. (Sub. Op.) 2.] -Memorandum by Members of the British Optical Industry, November 1925.Memorandum agreed by the following members of the British Optical Industry: Messrs. Barr and Stroud, Ltd.,Messrs. Chance Brothers and Co., Ltd.,Messrs. Adam Hilger, Ltd.,Messrs. The Parsons Optical Glass Company!Messrs. Ross, Ltd. &apos;  [-Sir Charles Parsons,Sir Howard Grubb, Parsons and Co jMessrs. Taylor, Taylor and Hobson, Ltd.Preamble.(A.) It is postulated that the safety of this country and the Empire demands the continuance of an efficient British Optical Industry.(B.) There is practically no manufacture of optical instruments anywhere within the Empire, except in Great Britain.(C.) The British Optical Instrument Industry is a relatively small industry, employing before the War approximately 2,000 persons and having approximately  500,000 capital invested in it.(D.) Prior to the War the British Industry maintained itself, in spite of foreign competition, and originated and produced a great variety of novel and high-class instruments.(E.) During the War it was compelled to abandon its civil trade and to expand, so that it employed as many as 10,000 persons making the large numbers and great variety of optical instruments and instruments of precision required by the Naval, Military and Air Porces of Britain and many of her Allies, and at the close of the War its capital investment had greatly extended.(P.) In normal times it supplies the Services with the great variety of optical instruments and instruments of precision required by them, but it depends also upon civil work, and it is obviously of national importance that the Industry should be occupied in normal times on civil work on such a scale that its resources may be adequate and available for war work at any time of emergency.(G.) With this in view, it is also important that its work should include (a.) A variety of high-class instrument work providing occupation and training for the exceptionally skilled designers and workmen needed therefor; and(&amp;.) A number of manufactures of optical appliances in wide demand and pro-viding that kind of equipment and experience in mass or quantity production which must be available in war time.(H.) The industry has only a part of its home market, while it has a relatively small Empire trade and is in many lines of work (and particularly in the production on a large scale of articles in general demand) under-bidden by foreign manufacturers.(I.) It should here be explained how very profitable it is for many foreign manu-facturers to supply optical instruments to this country. The reason lies in the fact-that the overhead charges oi the Industry, including as they do large expenditures on research, experiment and design, are extraordinarily heavy. In normal times they entail the addition of 100 per cent, to the total cost of wages and material, and at the present time approximately 200 per cent. Also, the discounts given to merchants are extraordinarily heavy, the retail dealer taking from one-third to one-half of the retail selling price and the wholesaler up to 60 per cent, of the retail price.(J.) In a trade in which the cost of direct labour and material is only about one-fourth to one-sixth of the retail price, and the overhead charges commonly amount to more than one-half of the wholesale price, it pays the foreign manufacturer, who has a large home market, to expand his output, to spread his overhead charges over such larger output, and to sell in this country what he cannot sell elsewhere, especially as he can employ for his larger output economical methods of quantity pro-duction which are impossible to those whose market is more restricted. He could do this with advantage to himself, even though he had to pay the whole of the Duty at present levied here under the Safeguarding of Industries Act (but this he does not,
have to do). No such course is open to a British manufacturer having no large market and being subject to foreign competition.(K.) Under present circumstances the Industry has difficulty m carrying on, three firms have already gone into liquidation, and unless suitable help is givenj others are likely to follow.        v(L.) What the Industry needs is orders, and these could be had in a short time very largely by checking the imports into this country and the Dominions of foreign-made Telescopes and Binoculars, Photographic Apparatus (including Lenses), Cinema Projection Apparatus (including Lenses), Microscopes and Surveying Instruments. The larger part of these articles (especially those first named) are luxuries. The total wholesale value of such imports into Great Britain during the last year was approximately  300,000. But the immediate help which the Industry needs can be given only by expediting the placing orders for Service instruments, and directing that optical instruments purchased with State funds should be of British manufacture.-Recommendations.1. That, having regard to the facts stated in Paragraphs (I) and (J), the rate of Duty levied in this country under the Safeguarding of Industries Act, or otherwise, upon all optical instruments and optical glass should not be less than the largest rate at which such Duty is levied by any other country.2. That if recommendation No. 1 should fail, there should be a Bounty on exports sufficient to maintain the Industry in the condition necessary for national safety.3. That a serious effort should be made to secure the protection by all Govern-ments in the Empire of this vital industry, and that, while there should be free trade within the Empire, a Duty equal to that recommended in No. 1 hereof should be levied in all countries of the Empire on optical instruments not made within the Empire.4. That instruments made in substantial part in a foreign country should not under any circumstances be admitted as Empire products. (It is generally quite easy for anyone familiar with the Industry to indicate the true origin of any optical instrument). To this end, steps might be taken, in concert with the various Dominion Governments, to check the importation into the Empire as Imperial Products of instruments made to any large extent in foreign countries. At present such goods can be shipped to one of the Colonies, and then, with the expenses of boxing, shipping and selling added, are counted as Colonial products and admitted to this country without restriction, when only 25 per cent, of the total cost is expended in the Colony. This limiting percentage should not be less than 75 per cent, of the factory cost.5. In endeavouring to carry on since the War the Industry has exhausted its reserves of capital, and fresh capital will have to be found for any further develop-ments. Such capital is unlikely to be found except on the complete assurance that any special protection granted will be continued for at least five years to enable the Industry to re-establish itself.6. That the Services should expedite the placing of orders for optical instruments, and considerably augment them in order to give immediate support to the Industry.7. That grants by the Board of Education, or other Departments, for the purchase of optical instruments for educational or other work should be made on the condition that the major part of such instruments should be wholly of British manufacture.8. That a sum of, say,  10,000 should be provided in the Estimates, to be applied in encouraging the invention and development of optical instruments of all kinds by firms in the British Industry.9. That, in order to uphold the reputation of British Optical Instruments, the National Physical Laboratory should be prepared to issue certificates regarding them at greatly reduced (and merely nominal) fees.(Signed) ARCHIBALD BARR.(Signed) W.
