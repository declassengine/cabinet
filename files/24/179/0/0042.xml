[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]    ^ ^Printed for the Cabinet.CONFIDENTIAL.42^ Pit. TForeign Office,. March    , 1926.Sir,HIS Ma,jesty&apos;s Government have had under con-sideration your Excellency&apos;s reports on your recent conversations with&apos; the Turkish Government at Angora Avith a view to arriving at a final and friendly settlement of the Irak frontier dispute; and the question has further been discussed with you, during your visit to London for consultation regarding the&apos;        &apos; -  &apos; i.      in i......1.1----j.- ____.1.,. t-r.The attached draft of instructions to Sir Ronald Lindsay regarding negotiations with Turkey is circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs for the approval of the Cabinet. ^C^^o-t-r-a-zJ.March 30, 1926.(14366 a)Will        UUDIUIUIO        kJKj      UU       wuuiuuv      ^^aj.      -^^^^^________Treaty laying down a frontier which, while involving substantial concessions to Turkey to the south of the eastern section of the &quot; Brussels&quot; line, shall not involve such considerable transfer of population as would create serious unrest throughout Irak, increase the administrative difficulties and military expenditure of His Majesty&apos;s Government in. that country, and be out of harmony with the principles of the League of Nations. The limits within which you are authorised to offer territorial concessions to Turkey will be communicated to you separately.4. In view of the responsibilities assumed by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the League of Nations in respect of Irak, as set forth in the League councils decision of the 27th September, 1924, in the Anglo-Irak Treaty of 1922 annexed thereto, and in the new7 Anglo-Irak Treaty of the 13th January, 1926, which was approved by the League Council on the 11th March, 1926, the sanction of the Council will have to be obtained before any territory now included in Irak is transferred to Turkey. Article 8 of the. 1922 Treaty provides that no territory in Irak shall be ceded or leased or in any way placed under the-control of any foreign Power; paragraph IV of the British undertakings accepted by the League Council on the 27th September, 1924, provides that no modifi-cations of the 1922 Treaty will be agreed to by His Majesty&apos;s Government without the Councils consent; and the Council on the 11th March, 1926, pronounced 3361 [14366]
the &quot; Brussels &quot; line, as described in their decision of the 16th December, 1925, to be the definitive frontier between Turkey and Irak, while postponing to a later date consideration of the steps required to ensure its demarcation. The sanction of the Council will there-fore be required .for the transfer to Turkey of any territory south of the &quot;Brussels&quot; line; the most convenient time for obtaining such sanction will probably be after the signature of the treaty and before the exchange of ratifications.5. As regards the general form of the treaty, it should be concluded, in view of the international status already acquired by Irak as a State capable of making Treaties, between Great Britain and Irak of the one part and Turkey of the other part; but you are to act as the sole negotiator and signatory on behalf of both Great Britain and Irak, and will be provided with the necessary full powers by His Majesty the King and also by King Feisal.6. It appears preferable that the treaty shall be drawn up in the French language only, provided that the Turkish Government agree to a single authentic French text. - If they insist on an authentic Turkish text also, you will explain that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the Irak Government must in that event claim authentic texts in English and Arabic.7. In accordance with the usual practice as regards treaties laying down frontiers, the treaty shall not contain any clause limiting its duration to a particular period. It will, however, be necessary to include in it a provision releasing His Majesty&apos;s Government, on the termination of the special Anglo-Irak relations created by the existing Anglo-Irak treaties, and the League&apos;s decisions in regard thereto, from any obligations under the new Anglo-Turco-Irak Treaty except those mentioned in paragraph 9 below.8. No full and accurate geographical survey has yet been made of the country through which the frontier line to be agreed upon must pass : and it will therefore be necessary, in defining the frontier in the treaty, to indicate as far as possible the physical features, villages, &amp;c, which are to be assigned to Turkey and Irak respectively. This description must cover the whole line from Syria to Persia, including the portion of the &quot;Brussels&quot; line which it is not proposed to alter. The actual demarcation of the frontier line should, in accordance with the usual procedure, be effected by a commission composed of representatives appointed by the contracting parties, with a neutral president chosen by the Council of the League of Nations.9. His Majesty&apos;s Government regard it as im-portant that the treaty shall provide that the contracting parties accept as final and definitive the Turco-Irak frontier laid down therein, and will make no attempt to alter it.10. Apart from the territorial clauses indicated above, the treaty should comprise articles designed to promote good-neighbourly relations between Turkey .and Irak, by means of provisions dealing with matters such as tribal disputes, migrations, brigandage, and in general all matters usually regulated by a treaty of bon voisinage. It should provide, in particular, for the establishment of a standing joint commission, meeting periodically, to discuss questions arising out
of matters of this kind and to settle them in an amicable manner.11. The treaty should contain provisions on the lines of those in the Treaty of Lausanne regarding the nationality of residents in transferred territories and their right to opt within a certain period for Irak nationality.12. It should, if possible, be laid down in the treaty that the Council of the Ottoman Public Debt shall decide what portion of the debt attributable to the former Mosul Vilayet shall be borne by Turkey and Irak respectively in consequence of the new determination of the frontier. This arrangement should be proposed to the Turkish Government as a reasonable and equitable solution; but you are authorised to drop the proposal if they make serious difficulty regarding its acceptance.13. The treaty should provide for the application, as between Turkey and Irak, of (a) the convention respecting conditions of residence and business and jurisdiction and (&amp;) the Commercial Convention, both signed at Lausanne in 1923.14. His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome the conclusion of a Turco-Irak extradition treaty in accordance with the usages prevailing among friendly States ; and the agreement of Turkey and Irak to enter into negotiations for this purpose as soon as possible might well be embodied in an article of the new Anglo-Turco-Irak treaty.
