i   &apos; Board of Trade,Great George Street, S.W.I. 29th March, 1926.SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES ACT. 1921.Informal Committee.Dear President,I am sending you herewith the Report of the above Committee on the questions into which they were asked by you to inquire.In paragraph 161 of the report it Is indicated that the Committee have had before them a number of applications for inclusion of articles and substances within the scope of the Schedule to the Act in respect of which it .was not considered that a case had been made out.   The applications related to miners&apos; lamp glasses and heat-resisting glass for lighting purposes, electric incandescent lamps, calcium carbide, milk sugar and small arms. -As regards small arms the Cemmittee were of opinion that the quality of the imported arms is so Inferior to that of the British production as to make them hardly a competitive product,, and that in any event the difference in price is such that no duty in any degree comparable to existing or proposed rates on other manufactures would be of any appreciable help to the British Industry,   It is possible that some action might be taken on the lines of tightening up the existing prohibition on the importation of small arms imposed by Order in Council dated 24th karch, 1921, made under Section 45 of the Customs (Consolidation) Act, 1876.   At present the import prohibition is used as a means for regulating rather than restricting the
importation of small arms.   This suggestion raises, however, questions which were not within the competence of the Committee.The Committee have also had under consideration the question of the reduction of the degree of Empire preference given in respect of all the industries covered by the above Act.    They were of opinion, however, that as a question of high policy was involved they could not usefully express any opinion on the matter.   They have, however, recommended that serious consideration should be given to the possibility -which would not require legislation - of raising the percentage of Empire labour which would entitle Optical Glass and Optical Instruments to the Preferential Treatment given by the Act and in view of the vital importance of these particular products as munitions, and the fact that the preference accorded amounts to 100%, they trust that It may be found possible to give effect to that recommendation.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) Burton Chadwick.

SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES ACT, 1921: PART I. INFORMAL COMMITTEE. REPORTTO THE RIGHT HONOORABLE SIR PHILIP C UN LIFFE-LISTER, K.B.E., M.C., M.P.,PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.INTRODUCTION.Sir,We were requested by you to inquire into and report upon (a) the effect of Part I of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921, on the development of the industries manufacturing the goods Covered by the Schedule to that Act, (b) the question of the desirability or otherwise of an extension of Part I of the Act after its expiry on the 19th August, 1926, and (c) the question of the desirability of inclusion within the ambit of the Schedule of any articles- or substances not now covered, and we have the honour to present our Report herewith.2. The Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921, was passed on the 19th August, 1921, and Part I came into operation on the 1st October of that year, with a provision that it was to remain in force until the expiration of five years from the passing of the Act, 1.e., until the 19th August, 1926.    Part I of the Act provides for the imposition of a duty of Customs, equal to one-third of the value of the goods imported, on the commodities included In the schedule to the Act when not consigned from and grown, produced or manufactured in the British Empire.3. The purpose of that Part of the Act now in question was to enable certain industries, which the experience of the War had shown to be mainly or solely in the hands of foreign manufacturers, to develop In this country, and establish them selves on a basis which it was hoped would, in the long run, be firm enough to enable them to stand alone.    These industries-1-
IixTuODUCTION (C ON TP. ) .-.-w-,-,----- ----are concerned with the production of articles and substances of vital importance to the national saf ety in time of war and which are at all time of fundamental importance to the manufacturing and scientific interests of the community, and, in respect of some of the commodities, to the public health.4. In the main the industries concerned are comparatively small judged by the number of men employed.    They are, nevertheless, the source of supply of materials required by the staple industries of this country, of the scientific instruments required for the control of the output of important industries, and of the instruments, apparatus and materials required for that research which is essential to industrial,, scientific and medical progress.   The research and control departments of the firms engaged in the industries offer extensive opportunities of employment for students who havereceived scientific training at the universities..-5. The goods covered by the Schedule to the Act are as follows :.-&quot;Optical glass and optical elements, whether finished or not, microscopes, field and opera glasses, theodolites, sextants, spectroscopes    and other optical instruments.Beakers, flasks, burettes, measuring cylinders, thermo-meters, tubing and other scientific glassware and lamp-blown ware, evaporating dishes, crucibles, combustion boats, and other laboratory porcelain.Galvanometers, pyrometers, electroscopes, barometers, analytical and other precision balances, and other scientific instruments, gauges and measuring instruments of precision of the types used in engineering machine shops and viewing rooms, whether for use in such shops or rooms or not.wireless valves and similar rectifiers, and vacuum tubes.Ignition magnetos and permanent magnets.
INTnODUGTl^,,(CONTD. ) .441Arc-lamp carbons. Hosiery latch, needles.Metallic tungsten, ferro-tungsten and manufactured produots of metallic tungsten, and compounds (not including ores or minerals) of thorium, cerium and the other rare earth metals .All synthetic organic chemicals (other than synthetic organic dyestuffs, colours, and colouring matters imported for use as such, and organic intermediate products imported for their manufacture), analytical re-agenta, all other fine chemicals $except sulphate of quinine of vegetable origin) and chemicals manufactured by fermentation processes&quot;.6, As already indicated the substances in question were originally included in the Schedule for safeguarding consequent on the experience gained during the period of national emergency which was then of very recent date.    It is inevitable that lapse of time should turn attention from their war-time applications to their industrial uses, and it would not be surprising to find that industries which became of prime importance in this country during the war period   had since found new and increased outlets for their products for peace purposes.    Our review of the industries concerned proves that in most cases this has undoubtedly taken place.    Products which were not manufactured in this country, or which were made here on a large scale for the first time during the period of national emergency, and which were .initially safeguarded owing, in large measure,, to their use in such a crisis, have since proved to be of fundamental importance in British industries and in scientific research of all kinds.   VJhllst their key value in war should not therefore altogether be lost sight of, the key value of the industries for peace time requirements is we think, in general, itself adequate reason for taking special steps to ensure their healthy development in the United Kingdom.
IMTRODUCTI PIT ( CONTD.)7.     Ths industries concerned with the production of the foregoing articles fall into two broad divisions,(a) industries engaged in the manufacture of individual articles such as arc-lamp carbons, hosiery latch needles and magnetos, the use of which is restricted to a narrow field, and (b) industries engaged in the manufacture of wide ranges of articles having many individual members.8.     Although articles which are the products of the industries falling within the former division may at some future date be displaced from their present applications and importance, nevertheless there is no evidence before us which suggests that such displacement is likely to take place during the course of the next few years.     With regard to the s second group of industries, such as the chemical and optical instrument industries, though their various products may change in importance from time to time, and may even be entirely displaced by other new articles or substances, the individual industries as a whole will undoubtedly continue to be of great national importance.     The progress of science and its increasing appllca-tion to Industry will make ever-growing demands upon them.9.     We have received a considerable body of evidence from manufacturers of the goods covered by the Schedule as to the difficulties with which they have had to contend in their endeavour to establish the industries in this country, and with regard to the progress which has been made.    Evidence as to the supplies, quality- and price of the commodities in question has also been received from individual users, from associations of users, from university and other laboratories, and from the Services, and we have also had under our consideration representations made by the British Chemical and Byestuffs Traders&apos; Association,Limited.   We. also received valuable help from the Government Chemist.
INTRODUCTION (CONTD .)10,     We have had the  advantage also of the continuous presence at all our Meetings of Mr. Percy Ashley,C,B., the Principal Assistant Secretary in charge of the Industries and Manufactures Department of the Board of Trade, and Mr. H.T.Tizard, Acting Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research; and at our earlier meetings of Mr. A.J.Dyke,C.B,, C.B.E., now Deputy-Chairman of the Board of Customs and Excise, and   subsequent-ly of Mr. C.J.T.B. Grylls,  C.B.E., Secretary to that Board. Their knowledge of the industries affected by the Act, and of its  administration , have been of great help to us throughout our deliberations.Our conclusions with regard to each Industry are recorded below.OPTICAL GLASS AND OPTICAL ELEMENTS, Y;HETH R FINISHED OR NOT, WOROSCu?ES,FIELD&quot; AND 0PERfl?CT5BaS ,THEODOLITES, EEXPim^,m SPECTROSCOPES AND OTHER OPTICAL INSTOlfoiiNTS.(a) Optical glass.11.     Optical glass of a wide range of types is of vital importance for the manufacture of the innumerable varieties of optical instruments required by t he Fighting Services, and it is indispensable in the manufacture of a very large variet&apos; of optical instruments which are required for medical, physical, chemical, astronomical and other research, for the regulation of industrial processes, for nautical and aerial navigation, surveying   purposes,  and for general laboratory and educational requirements.12. Prior to the war the optical glass required by the manufacturers of optical instruments in this country was imported to the extent of approximately 90 per cent, from Germany and France.     The remainder was the output of the ono British maker, who manvifactured only 26 varieties of glass, some of which, however, were at least equal in their essential features to the corresponding /srieties made abroad
OPTICAL GLASS (CONTD.) In the year 1915, and also at a subsequent period, the works were considerably enlarged for war production, and during the years 1916-1917 an additional factory was built by a second firm to supplement the war requirements of the Fighting Services and of our Allies.     At a late period in the war a third firm also commenced to manufacture optical glass for use in its own output of optical munitions.13.     The large stocks of optical glass accumulated during hositlities both by makers and users were a serious bai to progress   after the war,  and as these were in many cases quite unsuitable for peace requirements very heavy financial losses resulted to the manufacturers.     Despite these losses, however, every endeavour has been made, by further experiment and research, to improve the quality and range of manufacture, and t o of the three firms now making optical glass offer respectively 95 and 80 varieties    of glass.     Evidence from consumers indicates the high standard of quality of the present production, a standard higher than that of pre-war days and unsurpassed in respect of many of the varieties by any other makers in the uorld.14.     Notwithstanding the increasing range and quality of the output of the British optical glass industry, solas at home are now but little in excess of those in 1931, end exports have fallen to almost negligible dimensions.15.     Accumulated stocks of optical glass and instruments at the time of tho armistice, subsequent trad:, depression and scarcity of Service orders, and the entry of optical instruments from the continent where depreciated exchanges and cheeper labour made production costs in sterling vary lor:, have been responsible   for lack of growth in home orders for optical glass.     The causes uhich favoured the entry of optical instruments, together with the tariffs
OPTICAL^GLASS (0OICTL . ) imposed by foreign countries, combined to reduce orders for abroad.     Every effort to meet competition has been made by way of improved methods of manufacture and quality of production, and prices have perforce been reduced to a level which has re - ax It e d in heavy losses.     For some types of optical glass the prices during 1925 were approximately 50 per cant, under those of 1921,  and still further reductions have been made during the current year in respect of certain kinds, bringing the prices down to figures less than 50 per cent   in excess of the pre-war level, (b) Optical elements and optical instruments,16,     The term &quot;optical elements&quot; refers to such articles as lenses, reflectors, and prisms made of optical glass or mineral substances.     Various combinations of these elements, when assembled in suitable mounts and furnished with the necessary carrying, adjusting and other devices peculiar to each case, constitute the complete optical instrument.     As with optical glass, so in the case of optical elements and instruments, the pre-war British Industry, though small, was efficient, and in respect of some articles, such a3 range-finders, it occupied the premier world position,     British photographic lenses hold a high place .;.n comparison with thopp-of the best Gorman makers, tho best astronomical telescopes were unsurpassed by the corresponding foreign makes,  and In the manufacture of special instruments required for particular scientific researches there existed a British firm for ahead of any foreign competitor.     Between the best binoculars of British and foreign make there was little to choose, although hore the advantage was on the side of the foreign article.    In respect of microscopes the British position was not so strong, although even here the best British microscope   objectives were only surpassed in quality in some of the highest powers.     The
boat foreign microscope elements were, however, of more uniform quality than were those of home manufacture. The weakness of the pre-war British industry lay primarily, therefore, not in the quality of its output taut in its small scale of production of each class of optical element and instrument.17. The German industry was in pre-war days ahead of that in this country largely owing to an assured market for its products consequent on the existence of a large standing army, av.d also upon the much wider degree of application of science to industry In Germany.    Mass production methods were in operation and the resulting lower costs gave that country the advantage in export markets.    The German home market is still very much \larger than the home market in this country, with tho consequence that overhead charges in manufacture are reduced, and cheaper methods of production can be employed than aro available to our manufacturers whilst their markot is small. The German makers can thereby undersell British instruments both in foreign markets and also, at least apart from the duty, in the British market as well. This advantage promises to bo greater in the &apos;future owing to a recent agreement between the leading Gorman optical firms aiming at reducing costs of production at practically all stages of manufacture from the raw material to the finished optical instrument.18. In the French industry, on the other hand, instrument parts were made in the homes of the workers and assembled at a central factory, and, this method, is still in large measure employed.19. Mass production became inevitable in the British ;industry during the war. The reduced market for optical instruments of recent years has, however, militated against theapplication of such methods for peace requirements, and the! ! -! jfinancial po-sition of the industry makes further extension of jjmass methods of treatment and production difficult to initiate,       !J.,!;i   ; &quot; ;&quot; .&apos; I i ;-ft-- ; i.........................______..........___________________........-v.&quot;......- r *        &apos;        .......4........w -...... ...............1 ........&apos;.............................-......................

SO. In the post-war years every reasonable effort-   appears to have beon made by the optioal instrument industry to reduce costs of production to a level at which progress might be possible, or at least its position bo maintained. Plant, machinery and tools have been designed to reduce labour costs and improve the quality of the output.    Nevertheless, as in the case of the optical glass industry very heavy losses have been experienced and three of the firms out of the total   of approximately twenty comprising the industry have gone into liquidation.    Large stocks of instruments produced for war purposes, which are still being retailed, decreased-orders from the Fighting Services, depreciated exchanges and low wages on the continent loading to large imports of cheap foreign instruments, and foreign tariffs against British exporters have combined to handicap the industry very severely.21. In an endeavour to meot foreign competition prices have been reduced very considerably since the Safeguarding of Industries Act,  1921, came into force.   Prices of one of the foremost firms in the industry which in the year 1921 were 100 ognt* above the pre-war level were reducod by1923 to from 50 to 60 per pent. above the pre-war figure, and at present are from 30 to 60 pgr^cent, above that level, the lower limit referring more particularly to the various types of lenses.    The present dogree of depreciation of the French franc has resulted in a roduction of import values to little more than one-half of the corresponding pre-war figures, and although to-day tho mark is relatively stable, prices of the better known German optical instruments are still somewhat below the pre-war values.    In addition large importa-tions of French and German optical instruments by lesser known makers are arriving at nominal prices with which it is impossible to compete.    It will be evident from these
OFTIOAI. STO:. (OOffTD.).figures that, in respect of many elements and instruments, the present rate of duty gives inadequate protection in the home market.    The degree of advantage which continental manufacturers have in foreign markets is also apparent.22. The decrease in labour employed throughout tho optical glass and instrument industries is very material compared with the pre-war volume of employment, and the present number of operatives employed, approximately, 1,200, is estimated as being about 60 por cent., of those employed in 1913.    This compares with the 78 per cent., of the pre-war numbers who were employed in 1921.    The decrease is doubtless due in a small measure to the installation of labour-saving plant, but mainly it reflects the depressed state of the industries under consideration.    The number of highly skilled operatives, in the industry is understood to be already quite inadequate to enable that rapid expansion in output to take place which a serious national emergency would entail, and&apos;the number is still decreasing.     The period required in the optical industry in which to train men for the exceedingly exact work in question is so very long that expansion of output is very much slower than in other industries.23. Under the adverse conditions described, continued research is only possible in an industry of considerable inherent vitality, and the advances which have been made during the post-war years appear to us to prove conclusively that the effect of the safeguarding tariff has ^een in no way detrimental to progress.    It has on the contrary been at least helpful in placing the British optical industry ahead of all competitors as regards the quality of many of its productions, although not unfortunately in respect of the price at which these can, in general, be marketed.
24. Considerable sums of money have been ^exp^ST^^^-n^-the improvement of photographic lenses and cameras, and lenses of extra large aperture, many times as rapid as any proviously known, have been designed.       New apochromatio lenses for process and three-colour work, special types of lenses for sports and natural history photography and telephotography, lenses for taking, and projecting cinematograph photographs,   lenses for aerial photography, and many   other new types have been produced, and the quality and range of lenses made by the British industry for all branches of photography appear to be superior to the beet offered by foreign firms.    Such high class lenses are, however, ueed only by the few, and by far the larger number of lenses sold in this country are of the cheaper and poorer quality, such as are made under conditions of cheap labour and depreciated ourrency.   For this reason, whilst British manufacturers have installed the most modern labour-saving machinery, and would under equal conditions of wages and v.;ith normal exchanges be able to hold their own, heavy losses have resulted.25. So far as spectacle lenses are concerned the large home market available would appear to offor the requisite condition for satisfactory development.       The market in these articles, however, was formerly almost entirely in German, French and American hands, less than 10 per cent, of the home consumption being made here, and every effort has recently been made to stop the growth of and cripple this section of the British industry.     British costs of production are in excess of those of foreign competitors, very considerably higher indeed than those in France, Low labour costs and the depreciated exchange in that country make competition with French product&quot; extremely difficult. The
OPTICAL iHLbiMEETS. ISTO.   (COffTD.)market obtained by the British manufacturer of spectacle lenses both at home and abroad   has been gained entirely on the quality of his output, and whilst exports appear to have been maintained it is manifest that any great extension is improbable unless the British manufacturer is placed in a position to compete with foreign makers in price as well.26. With regard to microscopes, new apochromatic objectives superior to any made abroad have been put on the market by British makers and are found to be essential for the most exacting type of microscopic work.    Accuracy of focussing and rigidity have been secured on British micro-scope stands to a degree unequalled elsewhere.    The high order of efficiency of the industry is further illustrated by the fact that when Gye and Barnard, in the investigation of filter-passing bacteria, required microscopes of a character not hitherto made in any country in the world for the further prosecution of their research,  their demands were, within a comparatively brief time, met by a British maker.27. So far as binoculars are concerned,  the slight pre-war advantage of the German manufacturer has been reversed, and in addition at least one field glass has been manu-factured with a larger angle of field than any made elsewhere, ilanufacturers appear to have made a real effort to meet modern requirements and foreign competition.28. The market in surveying instruments was seriously disturbed by the large Government stocks sold at very low prices after the war. Nevertheless the standard instruments have been re-designated and a number of new surveying instru-menzB have been evolved,    one firm \vho have devoted consider-able expense to devising a more accurate method of dividing, are now producing divided circles of remarkable accuracy.
OPTICAL ELEMENTS ... ETC;   (QQKTD* )29.    With regard to the very varied types of optical instruments os3untial in researohes in modern physics. British instruments are of very high reputation, and instru-ments for dealing with special branches of research have been ordered from all parts of the -world Including various German universities and even the German State testing laboratory.    A special new type of apparatus has been evolved by one firm for testing lenses in a manner which promises to revolutionise this branch of the industry. A&apos;new refractometer for testing optical glass has also been devised which is ahead of anything produced outside this country.30.    The private research work done by the firms in the industry is supplemented by that done for the industry as a whole by the British Scientific Instrument Research Association, which is aided by Government grant, and many problems of considerable Importance to the industry have thus been successfully solved.    The result of the private and co-ordinated research which has been effected in the post-war years has served to place the products of the British optical industry on a very high plane, and the Admiralty, War Off ice and Air Ministry, who are the largest users of optical instruments in the country, are satisfied that British instruments are capable of meeting their most exacting demands.31.    Prom the survey which we have made we are satisfied that under comparable conditions of manufacture as regards wages, hours of labour and other factors, and with normal exchanges, the British optical glass and instrument industries would be well able not only to maintain their position but to show that financial prosperity which their efficiency appears to us to merit.
32.    In addition, however, to the oauBee already referred to which have militated against success, there are two others which have prevented the realisation of that measure of security which was contemplated by the Act of 1921.33.   Although optical instruments as a whole are liable to duty, the component parts of these instruments are not all dutiable.    Consequently, by importation of such non-dutiable parts in separate consignments, and assembly of them in this country, payment of the duty may be evaded.    A&apos;e understand that this fact has been very detrimental to the interests of the British manufacturers, and we are of opinion that a provision should be inserted in any new legislation dealing with the subject to render liable to duty all component parts of instruments which are themselves dutiable.    In view of the fact that parts of optical instruments are as a rule applicable only to the assembling of such instruments or of other scientific instruments likewise liable to duty, we consider that little or no difficulty is likely to arise in the administration of such provision by H.M. Customs.34.    It has been represented to us that the Imports of duty-free cameras from Canada since Part I of the Act of 1921 became operative have also been very harmful to the British optical instrument industry. : The duties levied by the Act are not, as already pointed out, applicable in respect of imports which have been consigned from and manufactured within the British Empire.    Section 8 (1) of the Finance Act, 1919, empowers the Board of Trade to issue regulations prescribing the proportion of the value of Empire goods which is to be the result of Empire labour in order to obtain the Imperial preference resulting from that Act.    That proportion was fixed by the Board, by Order dated August 6r,h, 1919, as a minimum of 25 per cent.of
OPTICAL ELEMENTS&apos;. ETC  (OONTD *) - AZOthe total value of the goods.    By virtue of Section 1(3) ofthe Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921, goods which wouldbe deemed to be manufactured within the British Empire forthe purposes of Section (8) of the Finance Act, 1319, aredeemed to be so manufactured for the purposes of the act of 1921.    If, therefore, 25 per cent, of- the value of camerasimported from Canada is the result of Canadian labour, such goods enter this country free of duty.35. The following figures of importations of cameras fromthe United States and from Canada during 1921 and in later years, suggest that the representations are well justified,and that advantage has been taken of the 25 per cent, basisto import through Canada, American goods upon which only thenecessary minimum of Canadian labour has been expended topermit of duty-free entry.Imports of Cameras into the United Kingdom from the United States and Canada.Period.	From U.S.A.	From Canada.	Number.	Number.1921.	124,817 100,844 67,431 7,269	2,103	300,361	2,103	5,107 37,007 44,180 65,395	240,754 322,053 358,690 387,87036. The remarkable decrease since 1921 in the importations of cameras from the United States and the equally strikingincrease in the imports from Canada, commencing as they do in the very quarter in which Part I of the Act of 1921 came into operation, appear to indicate that the avoidance of the safe-guarding duty in the manner suggested has been of serious magnitude.
57. This might in the future he prevented we think,  both in the case of cameras and other optical instruments, by raising the proportion of the value of the goods within the Schedule which is required to be the result of Empire labour from 25 to 75 per pent.    This latter figure is operative in Australia for Empire preference purposes in the case of imports of optical instruments of the kinds which are made in that Dominion.   Under a 75 per cent, basis it might still be possible when oameras or other optical instruments are fitted with the cheaper kinds of American lenses, for the lenses to escape payment of duty,     Fe are informed that large numbers of American lenses are fitted to cameras imported from Canada,  and that thereby the beneficial effeot of the safeguarding duty on oamera lenses is very seriously diminished.     We, accordingly, recommend that in addition to raising the qualification for freedom from duty from 25 to 75 per cent.,  lenses should be treated as separate artioles from the rest of the camera or other optical instrument for duty purposes,38.   V-&apos;e have carefully considered the question of the sufficiency of the present rate of duty, and having regard to the inadequate protection given by the present rate of duty in respect of many of the articles in question we are of opinion that there is much to be said for an increase from 3373 per cent, to 50 per cent.    This would increase the sales of the British products,  and a decrease in costs of production and a reduotion in price may reasonably be expected to follow the greater proportion of factory capacity thus utilised, At present, restricted demand renders overhead charges disproportionately high.     Should the market available justify mass methods of production,  costs would fall still further,
OPTICAL ELEMENTS.  ETO:   (CONTD.)39. To sum up, we are satisfied as to the great importance of the optical glass and optical instrument industries, not only from the point of view of national defence,  but also from that of the desirability of maintaining industries which are themselves of the highest scientific value, and which contribute to the efficiency of many other important industries of this country.   Owing to causes beyond their control such as accumulation of war stocks, reduction in Servioe orders, the remarkable depreciation of continental currencies,  low continental wage rates,  and &quot;the loss of the export markets by high tariffs abroad and undercutting by continental competitors,  the industries have failed to obtain the full benefit which had been originally contemplated by the present Act.     The duty has in general prevented complete disaster to the industries, but it has not given them that financial stability whioh is necessary to enable them to embark on new methods of manufacture and new research to the full extent which is desirable. Nevertheless very substantial progress has been made- both in range and quality of products.     We are,  therefore,  of opinion that protection in these industries should be continued, and should,  moreover, be strengthened in the four directions we have indicated, namely, by raising the rate of duty, by raising the proportion of the value of goods which is to be the result of Empire labour in the case of imports from w ithin the Empire, by treating lenses contained in optical instruments as separate articles for duty purposes, and by   including for duty all component parts of dutiable instruments.

CRUCIBLES,   OOMBUSTlOK BOATS AND OTHER LABORATORY PORCELAIN^(a) Scientific glassware and lamp-blown ware.40.   Scientifio glassware consists in general of furnace-blown ware and of lamp-blown ware.   In the former class the glass tubing or other article to be manufactured is blown and otherwise fashioned by a highly skilled operative from molten glass taken direct from the furnace.    The majority of the articles falling within the latter olass are made from glass tubing, but all of them are the product of the labour of a skilled operator yrorking at the bench with the aid of a blow-lamp.   Many of the articles falling within both types are subsequently calibrated for volumetric purposes,41.   Scientific glassware, both furnace-made and lamp-blown, is used in the chemical, biological and other laboratories of educational and research institutions and industrial concerns, and prior to 1914 was in the main imported from Germany and Austria,     High grade thermometer tubing and a small quantity of medium and higher grade lamp-blown ware were made here. Competition with the imported lower grade lamp-blown ware, largely the product of cottage Industry, rendered its production in this country almost out of the question,42.   The outbreak of hostilities rendered large supplies immediately necessary for the medical services, explosives manufacture,  analytical operations in steel works and in re-searOhes undertaken for war purposes.   Manufacturers of table
SCIENTIFIC GLASSWARE,  ETC.   (COflTD.)and illuminating glassware commenced manufacture,  and additional factories, of which two are still in operation, were erected for the production of scientific glassware.43.    Large importations of foreign glassware followed the removal of restructions on importation at the end of the year 1919, and continued whilst the Safeguarding of Industries Bill, 1921, was passing through Parliament,   In the case of the more common types,  quantities estimated at two years&apos; consumption were imported during the few months immediately prior to the commencement of the operation of part I of the Act. The industry was thus faced with a very serious reduction in demand, furnaces had to be closed down,  the cost of expensive idle plant had to be carried, and the firms concerned have only been able to continue manufacture with an annual loss. These difficulties,  combined with the collapse of the mark, served to nullify any immediate benefit which might have been expected from the passing of the Act.44.    The production in quantity of hand-made ware required large numbers of highly skilled workers, such as have been available in Germany for generations owing to the virtual monopoly enjoyed by that country.     In the United iiingdom men had to be specially trained for this type of ware.   Further, as regards moulded glassware labour costs are a very high proportion of the whole,  and the lower wages and longer hours worked abroad prevented the duty imposed by the Act being an adequate protection.45*   The heavy ware portion of the furnace-blown section of the trade has suffered even more than the other sections and the largest British maker, whilst having available all the necessary moulds, has   ound it necessary to transfer most of the blowers to other work.
46. The light furnace-blown ware has also had considerable difficulty In meeting the very fierce competition from Germany and Czecho-s-Lovakia.    The wages in sterling in these countries are much below those In the United Kingdom.    In addition, owing to longer working hours, the fuel consumption and overhead charges for a given output of glassware abroad are lower than In this country.    In the case of Germany, moreover, a large home market is assured,   and by manu-facturing in excess of their home requirements the German manufacturers are enabled to reduce costs of production and sell   in this country and elsewhere much below the prices at which British makers can profitably produce. British manufacturers have been able to make sales only by reducing prices to the utmost limit.    In the case of heat resistance tubing, for example, sales shew a small upward tendency, users having realised that it is better in the long run to buy the higher, quality article, even if somewhat dearer, rather than the cheaper foreign one.47. That section of the Industry which manufactures lamp-blown ware has also had considerable difficulty in meeting competition from Germany In the types of ware more particularly which are the products of the Thuringian cottage industry, such as ampoules for medical work, test tubes, and tubes for clinical and other thermometers;   nevertheless this section is just able to hold its own with the aid of the existing duty, and employers in most cases are now able to maintain their workers on full time.48.  In general it may be stated that the existing duty has enabled British manufacturers to maintain and even increase their output.    To do this it has been necessary for them to
SCIENTIFIC GLASS BARS ETC :  (CONTD. ).improve the efficiency of their methods of manufacture- and. the quality of their production.    In some Instances also new types of glass have he en evolved.49. Evidence made available to the Committee from large users of scientific glassware indicates that the British ware is of high quality and is unsurpassed by and Indeed surpasses the best foreign makes.   No difficulty is experienced in meeting the tests of the National Physical Laboratory for volumetric glassware.50. As already indicated foreign competition has. rendered considerable price reductions inevitable since the passing^ of the Act, and every effort has been made by British manu-facturers to improve the efficiency of their &quot;operations -so as to enable these reductions to be made with the minimum of financial loss.   With regard, for example, to general laboratory glassware of the light furnace type, prices., in 1925 had fallen to about two-thirds of those ruling in 1&amp;21.:. and the price of laboratory glass tubing and teat tubes had fallen to approximately half the 1921 figure.    The rising cost of production In Germany has improved the market of late for the British manufacturers, and it appears that the price to British buyers of certain types of chemical glassware of good quality manufactured by the best German firms, when the duty and freight, are added, is now very close to the price of the corresponding British product.   When the margin in favour of the foreign manufacturer is small, orders are given to the British maker which would otherwise go abroad, as the high quality of the British article and the quick delivery possible more than outweigh a slightly higher price.    If the duty were removed it appears to us that the price of the foreign article
RCJENTIFIC OLASTlTATJITM-Cr.   (UOKTlT.&apos; H would be so much below that at which sales of British manufacture are possible, that the industry would be placed at a very grave disadvantage.51. The industry is of the highest importance to this country both in times of peace and war, and we are of opinion that it is extremely undesirable that the United Kingdom should ever again be dependent upon foreign makers for articles of such wide and general application.     The evidence available to us suggests that a further period of safeguarding should enable the industry to consolidate itself on a firmer basis than has been possible hitherto and ultimately enable it to stand alone.(b) Laboratory porcelain.52. Under the term &quot;laboratory porcelain&quot; are included a number of porcelain articles specially manufactured for use in chemical operations.    The porcelain requires to possess very special characteristics, of which ability to withstand sudden changes of temperature, resistance of the glaze to the action of acids, alkalies and other chemical substances with which it may come in contact, constancy of weight on heating to high temperatures and freedom from cracks in the glaze are among the most important.   During war laboratory porcelain is essential in connection with the manufacture of explosives and in the testing of steel and other materials .S3, In pre-war days Germany was virtually the sole source of supply of the porcelain used in British research laboratories and educational institutions.    The shortage consequent on the outbreak of war resulted in a serious effort to manufacture in this country.   Of the five firms who commenced production, only two succeeded in manufacturing
LABORATORY PCRCBiAlM  (COM TP.) .laboratory porcelain comparable with the best pre-war German ware, although at least one of the other firms is still making.54. The factors which have operated in the case of optical Instruments and scientific glassware have in this instance also In a large measure enhanced the difficulty which has been experienced in establishing the Industry in this country.    The importation of cheap porcelain from Japan and of inferior lesser known German   makes has still further harassed the British manufacturer.    The difficulties inherent in the manufacture of satisfactory ware have also proved to be very considerable, a fact which Is emphasized by the reflection that German laboratory porcelain required some thirty years to attain its pre-war standard of quality.55. Sales of British porcelain have declined since 1921, and during the greater part of 1925 very considerably so. A number of the trained operatives have been disbanded and it has been with the utmost difficulty that the Industry has been maintained.   An improvement in sales has been manifested however, in the last quarter of the year 1925 and still continues.56. Evidence ifaich has been made available to us as to the quality of the British ware appears at , first sight to be somewhat conflicting.   On the one hand the laboratories of one of our large universities find British laboratory-porcelain at its best to be of excellent quality and equal to the best pre-war imported ware, although liable to vary in quality from time to time.    The experience of another large user indicates that British porcelain fails under certain sever conditions, but is other?;ise satisfactory, Ko fault Is found by this user with the quality of the glaze.
LABORATORY PORCELAIN  (OONTO.)of the best British make and there appears to be no question of loss of weight on heating.      The clay body, however, it has been stated, is less- durable than is that of the best foreign ware.    This is a defect which has been receiving attention from the manufacturers.57.    It would appear that a large measure of the criticism which has been levelled against laboratory porcelain of British make ie based on experiences dating back two or three years ago, when even the best makers had not achieved the same measure of success as they have to-day, and also on trials of one or two inferior British makes which cannot claim to be equal to the best imported ware.58.    It appears, nevertheless, to be clear that British porcelain has not yet in general attained the standard reached by the best foreign ware, although the best British makes show, for most ordinary purposes, little inferiority. Impartial tests which have been made for us on the quality of British laboratory porcelain indicate that there are still at times certain defects which only time and continued research can overcome,    other defects - occasionally appear which seem to suggest inadequate inspection prior to sending out the finished article from the works.    We are of opinion that it would be to the advantage of the British firms engaged in manufacture to co-ordinate their research on this matter under the control of one of the research associations of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.59.    The manufacture of laboratory porcelain is closely allied with that of certain other porcelain articles made by. the same makers and required for special industrial purposes. The
LABORATORY PORCELAIN ( COM TP .)transmission of high tension electric currents will require the supply of porcelain insulators made of the high grade porcelain now in question.    There is no doubt that the experience already gained by British firms in the manufacture of laboratory procelain will be of considerable service in the production of such insulators and other articles as may in the future have wide industrial applications.   In all these cases the materials used and the type of heat treatment required are understood to be very similar.60.   Not only are the manufacturing considerations of the same nature but the financial aspects of the manufacture of laboratory porcelain and of the other high grade porcelain articles referred to are also closely interlinked, and ability to manufacture any of the articles on a commercially sound basis is dependent in large measure on the successful manufacture of the others which should bear their   due proportion of the total overhead charges,61.   It appears to us that if the laboratory porcelainIndustry is to be established in this country,  continuedsafeguarding for a further period of years is essential.   Unlessreasonable financial stability is secured by a satisfactorymarket for the British ware, adequate expenditure on researchdirected towards the manufacture of perfect laboratoryporcelain would be impossible,GALVANOMETERS,   PYROMETERS,  ELECTROSCOPES.

GAUGES AM) MEASURING INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION p^1 THE TYPES USED IN ENGINEERING MACHINE SHOPS AND VIEWING ROOMSj FHETHER FOR USE IN SUCH SHOPS OR ROOMS OR NOT7(a) Scientific instruments.62.   Under the heading &quot;scientific instruments&quot; are inoluded a large number of non-optical instruments essential for naval
military and air force needs in time of war, and of prime importance in every branoh of physical,  chemical and medical research, tooth in times of peace and war.   Although a limited range and quantity of such instruments were manufactured in this country prior to the year 1914 we were largely dependent on foreign supplies.63.    The degree of safeguarding afforded by the Act of 1921 has enabled manufacturers in this country to extend the production of instruments previously made, and very considerably to increase the range of their products.   Evidence available to us indicates that such improvement has been effected, for example, in respect of electro-dynamometers, voltmeters,  ammeters, wattmeters, wheatstone bridges, ohmmeters,  photometers,  insulation testing sets,  eleotrostatic voltmeters, frequency recorders and pyrometers.    The increase In output of the varioxis makers concerned over that in 1921 varies between 20 and 80 per cent., and there appears to be little doubt that but for the trade depression during the years since the passing of the Act,  this increase would have been still greater.64.   In respect of mathematical drawing instruments a much larger expansion of output has taken place.    Methods of mass production have been initiated and one large firm of- manu-faoturers has produced in the year 1925 approximately four times the number of Instruments manufactured in. 1921.65.    Considerable price reductions have taken place in attempts to encourage sales and meet the competition from America and tho continent,   pyrometers, for example, have been reduced by 15 to 20 per cent.,  other measuring instru-ments by 33^3 per cent.,reoording instruments by 35 per cent.-2 6-
and insulation testing sets by as much as 50 per cant. Mathematical drawing Instruments also show considerable reductions varying up to 40 per cent, compared with the price in   1921.66.   The reductions in price which have taken place appear to have been accompanied by improvements in quality and accuracy, and a standard specification for certain electrical instruments issued In 1919 is now being revised owing to. the greater accuracy which can be given by British raamifacturers *67.   Evidence of the quality of British instruments has been furnished to us by the National physical Laboratory and by certain large users of scientific instruments, and it appears olear that in general the British article is of very satisfactory quality.   Certain patterns of electrical instruments used as standards are still imported from the United States.     Their quality is very high, but the number sold is not large.   The financial outlay involved and the research required for their specialised manufacture has hitherto debarred British makers from competing.   So far as mathematical drawing instruments are concerned the high quality of the British instruments appears to be now admitted not only in this oountry but also by users in the Dominions, with the consequence that foreign instruments are being rapidly displaced in those markets.68.   The general effect of the existing duty on the scientific instrument industry has been, in our opinion,undoubtedly beneficial, although save in respect of mathematical drawing instruments we have no evidence of such keen attempts at undercutting as have been exjjerlenoed by some other industries which we have reviewed.    The duty s.ppears to have turned the scale in favour of the British instrument when the price of the
foreign article together with the duty has&quot; been only slightly below the British price.    The few standard instruments just referred to form an exception to this statement.69.   We should consider it disastrous If the highly skilled workmen who have been trained in this infant British industry were dispersed in the manner which would almost inevitably follow any general removal at this stage of the safeguarding duty.    It is, we consider, in the best interests of both pure and applied science that the home industry should be assisted to attain even greater skill and accuracy in its products than has been possible in the comparatively brief period that it has been established here on its present scale, and thereby ultimately to equal or surpass its competitors.70.   As in the case of optical instruments, so with the other scientific instruments now under consideration, the importation of parts of instruments free of duty goes far to counteract the beneficial effect of safeguarding the finished instruments, and ve recommend that component parts of non-optical scientific instruments shall also be liable to duty.(b) Gauges and measuring instruments of precision of the types used m engineering machine shops and viewing rooms.71.    Gauges are essential in modern engineering works, particularly where mass production of interchangeable parts Is carried on.    Nevertheless in 1914 the quantity manufactured here was very small, and reliance was placed on imports from Switzerland, Germany and the United States.72.    Gauges during the War were supplied, but only after a dangerous loss of time by intensive production by the most diverse organisations supplemented by importations from
-    4&apos;67friendly and neutral oountries.   At the close of hostilities large stocks of gauges had been accumulated, and these, together with large imports, oaused the demand for new gauges of ordinary types of home manufacture to be small.    Some of the makers were in consequence compelled to close down their works.   After the passing of the Act of 1931 the position appears to have gradually improved, works were re-opened, and from the year 1922 onwards the trade has steadily grown, with an increasing share also in export orders.    One large manufacturer of gauges reports an increase in sales in 1925, of some 30 per cent., over the previous year and yet another an increase in sales of more than 50 per pent., over the 1924 figure.    Although the market is gradually increasing there appears to be considerable foreign competition to supply the demand, and the imports, principally from America, have continued to grow.73. The very large home market available in the United States makes production possible at a cheaper rate than in this country and cheaper labour on the continent has a similar effect. It has only been by means of the duty that British manufacturers have been enabled to obtain orders. In some cases the British makers are thereby enabled to quote even lower in the British market than their foreign competitors.74. The range of variety in gauges made by the British industry now comprises almost all the types normally required, although so far as micrometer gauges are concerned the manufacture does not as yet appear to cover every variety, and reliance has still to be placed on America and Switzerland in certain cases.    Steps are, however, being taken to increase the output of micrometer gauges in order to reduce our dependence on foreign imports.    To enable this to be done continued support to the industry will be essential.
GAUGES (oontd.)75. The methods of manufacture devised during the \&apos;var have been modified and improved, and the degree of accuracy required has been considerably raised.    British gauges appear, in general, to be of very high quality, and no difficulty is experienced in satisfying the exacting tests of the National Physical Laboratory.76. An increasing use of gauges will necessarily follow an increase In mass production methods, especially of standardised machine parts, in the engineering and allied trades, and it appears to us to be of the greatest importance that this country should not be again dependent on foreign manufacturers for supplies of such fundamental requisites,WIRELESS VALVES AND SIMILAR RECTIFIERS, AND VACUUM TUBES, (a) Wireless valves and similar rectifiers.77. During the late war and prior to the year 1921 valves for wireless receiving purposes, both in this country and abroad, v;ere of the bright emitter type.   Subsequent to that year receiving valves of the dull emitter variety came into use, involving considerable saving of electrical energy and having a longer life.   Valves of the dull emitter type are also well adapted for use on telephone repeater stations for the improve--ment of long-distance telephony, and are now being manufactured to a special specification for that purpose.   During the last year or tvro valves have tended to become more specialised In their application, and instead of a demand for valves which are suitable for any position in a receiving set, valves particularly fitted for specific purposes have come more and more to the fore.   Research has also led to the production of new types of valves and oo the production of valves having very special properties for particular work,    Speed of manufacture has also been increased by inauguration of new or improved processes.
4 n q-.1ikeless VALVES (opntd.) 078. Considerable progrees has also been made in the manufacture of transmitting valves since 1921.    Valves of the glass envelope, type were then employed having a nickel anode. Experiments were made directed to the discovery of a less volatile metal, as nickel placed a limit on the power that could be dissipated at the anode.   Molybdenum was finally proved to be superior to any other metals tried.    The advent of the molybdenum electrode was followed by the substitution of silica for glass in the envelope of the valve, and it is understood that valves of the silica envelope type, which are said to possess a number of advantages over other kinds, are made by British manufacturers alone *79. A still later development in transmitting valves consisted in the introduction of cooled anodes, constructed of copper, iron, or nickel iron alloy, and cooled by circulating water or oil.    The filament power oi* such valves is greater than in any other cype and ensures an electron emission so high as to be measurable in amperes.    Valves of this type are now being used in the large transmitting station at Rugby,80, The demand for transmitting valves of long life has led to research on the possibility of adapting dull emitter valves for transmitting purpoees, with the result that several types are now on the market.81. The development in recent years of extra high tension rectifiers suitable for cable testing and similar operations has created a demand for valves of very special characteristics, and these have been successfully developed.82. Considerable sums have been expended by the British valve industry on research Work, and these have grown year by year,   Unless a continuation of this policy is
ft IPIILE5S VALVES (contd. ) possible the British industry will soon be left behind.83. The importation of foreign valves has increased between the years 1924 and 1925 by some 250 per cent., and it appears to us that foreign competition may in the future be a much more serious factor in the valve industry than hitherto.84. Prices of British valves have fallen to from 35 to 60 per; cent, of the prices in 1922, according to the type of valve and other factors, but in spite of such considerable reductions, valves of continental manufacture are, we understand, on sale in this country at prices from 30 per cent, to 70 per cent lower than those charged for similar types of British valves.85. Under these circumstances we consider that failure to renew the safeguarding duty for a further period of years would very seriously prejudice the continuation of the research work in the Industry which we consider so essential. Having in mind the numerous and important applications of wireless valves, especially of the transmitting type, in normal times, such as for long distance communication with ships at sea and for transmission of messages by ships in distress, and their indispensability in time of war, we are of opinion that no steps should be taken which would militate against the continued progress of this important industry, (b) Vacuum tubes.86. Vacuum tubes include, primarily, X-ray tubes, which ar(* of considerable value in scientific research, in medical diagnosis, in surgery and in metallurgical analysis.    They have also a large potential field of employ-ment in dentistry and in the research and control depart-m-.nts of numerous industries.    The manufacture of suoh tubes
VACUUM TUBES (contd.)in this country, carried on to a small degree prior to the year 1914, received considerable Impetus during the war, but has declined since the cessation of hostilities.   At the present time there are not more than four or five makers in this country, all of whom, it is understood, have a restricted output,87. There are two main types of X-ray tubes in use, the gas tube and the hot cathode or Coolidge tube, the latter of which is the subject of a patent which would normally expire in June, 1929.   There appears to have been very little development in the manufacture of gas tubes since 1921, and the total output has much diminished. This is in part due, we understand, to the longer life of modern tubes, to the competition of the patented tube, and to the, as yet, restricted market for X-ray tubes of any kind in this country,    we understand, however, that a new type of gas tube is about to be placed on the market by British manufacturers.88. Prices have been reduced somewhat since the Safeguarding of Industries Act came into force and it appears that continental X-ray tubes of the gas variety of high quality are sold here at prices which, duty paid, approximate to the British price.89. As already pointed out, a large potential market for X-ray tubes exists, and we consider that it is very desirable that British requirements for such an
VACUUM TUBES (contd.)important adjunct to medical and surgical practice, and to scientific and industrial research and control, should be met by manufacture in this country.    Having in view the fact that the non-patented British tubes can only be sold here in competition with imported tubes when the existing duty is added, we recommend that the safeguarding duty be continued for a further period of years, during which the probable ultimate applications of X-ray tubes will become more apparent.IGNITION MAGNETOS AND PERMANENT MAGNETS.(a) Ignltion magnetos.90. Ignition magnetos are used primarily on motor vehicles and aircraft, and to a minor extent&quot;on stationary internal combustion engines.    Prior to 1914 only very few magnetos were made in this country, and the demand was met almost exclusively by Importation from Germany.    The huge Tfar demand necessitated manufacture in this country on a large scale.    By the Finance (No.2) Act, 1915, an ad valorem duty of 33^/3 per cent., was imposed on magnetos for motor cycles and motor cars other than commercial cars and certain other limited exceptions.    The duty imposed by the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921, was not additional to the former duty, and the effect of the Act of 1921 was therefore to place magnetos for all cars and for all types of engine on an equality as regards the rate of duty.
IGNITION MAGNETOS  (CONTD.)91.   The British industry has increased at a rapid rate since the year 1921, and returns of sales from the leading manufacturers of magnetos indicate an output in the year 1925 several times as large as in the former year.     Of a total of thirty-seven motor manufacturers whose reports were made available to us, all but three use exclusively British magnetos except in the case of special orders.92.   Prices have fallen as output has increased and as internal competition has developed among the British makers, and the average price over the total sales effected in the year 1925 Is barely one-half of the corresponding figure in 1921.     Information obtained from the motor manufacturers already referred to indicated that the cost to them as con-sumers of magnetos has decreased by a less percentage than the makers1 total sales suggest.     The reduction varies in the case of the different users, up to 51 per cent, since October 1921, but the average of the percentage reductions reported by makers of private cars is 33-^ per, cent,    and by makers of commercial vehicles 16 per cent.93.   The number of employees in the industry, so far as the firms in question are concerned, has also almost doubled since 1921, and is now we understand in excess of 4,500,94.   Strong efforts are being made by the industry to capture the export market, and exports are increasing.   Their total value is still, however, a very small proportion of the total sales of magnetos, and has been up to the present off-set by an importation of foreign magnetos to a very similar f figure.95.   The development of the magneto industry in this country to an extent which now enables it to supply all requirements
IGNITION MAGNETOS  ( CONTD . )has only been made possible by a large expenditure in research, conducted separately and also jointly by the chief manufacturers.     The evidence available to us points to the design of British magnetos being at least equal if not superior to that of any manufactured abroad, and to the general..Quality being quite as high as that of the best imported ma gne t os .96.   The foreign manufacturers of magnetos had, as already pointed out, almost a monopoly of the British market prior to the year 1914, and we have received evidence which indicates the danger of a serious and concerted effort being made to recover that market should any opportunity, such as removal of the existing duty arise.      So long as the duty on non-commercial motor cars and their accessories imposed by the Finance  (No. 2) Act, 1915, and re-Imposed by the Finance Act 1925, remains in operation,  ignition magnetos which are imported for use on such cars will continue to be liable to the existing duty.     Unless, however, that duty is extended at some future date to include all motor vehicles and their accessories, magnetos for use on commercial cars will be free from duty if the Safeguarding of Industries Act 1921 is allowed to lapse.     Even should magnetos for all motor cars become liable to duty apart from that Act, certain magnetos such for example as those required for stationary and aircraft engines, would still presumably be duty-free on its exp iry-.97.   Although large scale production of magnetos has been developed in this country, such mass production also exists in certain foreign countries and we consider that a removal of the safeguarding duty at this stage would open the way
IGNITION I1A.GMETOS  ( GONTD . )to a severe blow at the British industry.      Although ignition coils are used in place of magnetos to a small extent in Great Britain, the overwhelming proportion of motor engines are provided with magnetos, and the magneto industry is accordingly still of vital importance to this country. We are consequently of the opinion that the protection should be continued until the manufacture of magnetos has established itself still more securely as a permanent British industry, (b) Permanent magnets.98.   Permanent magnets are used in the manufacture of ma/rhetos, telephone receivers, wireless head-phones and loud speakers, and electric ity meters and other electrical instruments such as ammeters and voltmeters.99.   Prior to 1914 British supplies were obtained mainly from Germany and Prance.     The requirements of the war, however, and the subsequent safeguarding duty have, it is understood, enabled the British magnet industry to arrive at a condition when it is capable   of supplying the whole of the home demand for magnets of the various forms and sizes required.     There is, moreover, no reason to think that the quality is inferior to that of any foreign make.     Prices also have fallen very materially, some 35 per cent., since 1921, not only on account of reductions in price of the raw materials, but also owing to the keen competition between the various British makers.100.   Whilst the export trade in permanent magnets is very small, owing to the collapsed exchanges ir certain continental countries, and to the tariff in other foreign markets, the imports are by comparison considerable, and in some branches seriously affect the output of the British makers,
PERMANENT MAGNETS  (OONTD.).In the case of one of the largest manufacturers, the removal on the 1st January, 1925, of the embargo on the use of imported apparatus by holders of wireless receiving licences speedily reduced the monthly output of magnets, we were informed, to less than the daily output for many months previously, and it is only during the latter months of the year that the monthly production has somewhat recovered, and even then to less than twice the daily output prior to 1925.101. The operation of the duty has enabled British manufacturers to meet competition in the home market in most branches of the magnet industry.    Tho manufacturers now appear to be fully occupied, apart from that soction of their factories which provides magnets for wireless head-phones. The latter, at least in the case of some firms, has not recovered from the setback received in January of 1925 to which reference has been made.102. The magnet industry has helped very materially in keeping in operation the crucible melting furnaces supplying the necessary tungsten steel and other alloy steels used. We feel that not only for this reason but also because of the desirability of producing in this country an article essential in the manufacture of magnetos and important electrical Instruments, the magnet industry should be protected for a still further period.     Foreign competition would probably cripple or overwhelm it if the duty were now removed.ARC-LAMP CARBONS. 103.    Until the year 1902 the United Kingdom was entirely dependent on foreign sources of supply of arc-lamp carbons.
ARO-LAMP OARBONS  (CONTD.).In that year however, a factory was erected by a private firm which after many years of effort and research was finally able to meet all the requirements of the Fighting Services for this commodity.     The knowledge and experience thus gained proved of great value at the outbreak of the late war, when the demands of the Services for searchlight carbons increased to such an extent that the size of the existing factory had to be at once doubled.     Other factories sprang up for the production of arc-lamp oarbons to supply war requirements, and at the termination of hostilities it was decided after very careful consideration that at least one of the works must be retained in operation.104.   The consumption of carbons for street lighting has considerably diminished of recent years, and the   chief commercial demand is now for cinematograph purposes.    The whole peace-time requirements of this country for arc-lamp carbons could be supplied by the existing works, but owing to foreign imports, which have been steadily increasing, the home output has diminished, and the financial loss has become so serious that part of tho manufacturing plant has been closed down.105.   The foreign competition has been the more severe ow to the introduction into the cinematograph industry during the last year or two of a new type of projection lamp known as the mirror lamp.      The varieties of this sold in the home market are understood to be either of foreign make or to have been developed for the consumption of foreign carbons.    In some of these varieties of lamp British oarbons appear to burn quite satisfactorily.    In other types fully satisfactory results have not yet been attained, although research work is
ARC-LAMP CARBONS (CONTD.).continually being pursued at groat expense to render British arc-lamp carbons efficient in all types of mirror lamps.loi&apos;. A further cause contributory to the foreign competition is the introduction of high current density lamps in the larger cinematograph theatres.     Such lamps consume carbons of exactly the same type as the high current density carbons consumed by the Services, and which are regarded as at least equal to foreign carbons provided the search-light lamp is designed to meet the characteristics of the carbons.    It has been represented to us that British carbons give better results in British search-light lamps than foreign carbons give in foreign lamps, although British carbons may give results in foreign lamps inferior to those given by foreign carbons.   As high current density lamps designed to take foreign carbons are understood to be on the market, the difficulties of the British maker   of arc-lamp carbonB are increased.107. We regard it as of great importance that some effective means should be found to safeguard this industry.    Should the production of arc-lamp carbons cease in this country the extensive and well-organised research work which has been proceeding for some time past with very satisfactory results would come to an abrupt end.     Heavy State expenditure would be required if it should prove necessary again to manufacture for national defence purposes, and the disbanding of the highly skilled personnel would involve considerable delay in obtaining any output at all in a time of emergency.108. The Safeguarding of Industries Act appears to have hitherto afforded little help to the arc-lamp carbon industry. The foreign manufacturers sell carbons in this country through sole agents, and it is in consequence not easy to decide &quot;the
ARC-LAMP CARBONS  (CONTD.)price which an importer would give for the ^cods&apos;1 in accordance with the provisions of section 10 (l) of the Safeguarding of Industries Act.     The average price at which they are imported appears to be considerably below the figure at which they are sold wholesale to large consumers.     To such an extent is this the case that the addition of the 53^/^ per cent, ad valorem duty a-pears to make little difference in the ability of the importer of foreign carbons very seriously to undersell the British maker.109.   We have in consequence given careful consideration to a number of proposals which have been placed before us for givinr satisfactory help to the industry, and we are of opinion that the metbod most likely to be effective is the imposition of a specific -uty based on weight in place of the ad valorem duty now in existence.       The arc-lamp carbon industry is one  in which such a duty could be levied with ease and convenience to all concerned.     We consider that a duty of l/-- per pound weight, which would represent approximately 33% per cent, of the average list price of arc-lamp carbons, would probably be effective in enabling the home industry to be continued, possibly not at a profit, but at least without loss.     Even this figure might well, under certain circumstances, prove insufficient to keep the industry alive, and we are of opinion that there is much to be said for imposing a higher rate of duty.HOSIERY LATCH NEEDLES. 110.   Hosiery latch needles form an essential part of the knitting machines used for the large scale production of knitted hose, knitted underwear and other knitted goods, and are consumed in this country to the extent of approximately
HOSIERY LATCH NEEDLES  (CONTD. )50 millions per annum.     Although the latch needle was originally a British invention, the United Kingdom was, prior to the year 1914, dependent for the most part on latch needles imported Jfrom Germany.     A small proportion only of the total home consumption was of British manufacture, and consisted in the main of coarse gauge needles.     The outbreak of war resulted in a large demand for the production of knitted goods for the army, and medium and coarse gauge needles were the main requirement.111.   Since the war considerable expense has been incurred in the endeavour to Increase the output, range and quality of British latch needles.     New plant, however, was required, and for some two or three years subsequent to the passing of the Act of 1921 the supply of fine gauge latch needles of British manufacture was inadequate.     Between the end of September 1921, when the act came into operation, and September 1922, the output of latch needles by the six principal makers increased from I8V3 millions to over 28 millions, and of these the output of fine gauge needles down to 36 gauge had increased from less than 11 millions to over 19 millions.     The plant laid down by the end of September 1922 had a potential output of 35 million needles per annum, whereas at the present time it is considerably In excess of the total requirements of this country for latch needles.      It would appear that all the requirements of British users of latch needles can now be satisfied by the British makers.     We are informed,  indeed, that the six largest makers have ready for immediate delivery stocks of the finest gauge needles, down to 48 Badge, equal to many months&apos; output, and are in a position
HQSISRY LATCH NS3DJLES^(CONTD . )to accept many more orders than they are ahle to obtain. Large users of fine r^auge latch needles who during the past year have considerably increased their consumption have informed us that they have had no difficulty in securing all they required from the British Manufacturers. Of a total of over 800 patterns of latch needles which are in use, over 6 00 patterns are made by one firm alone.112.   During the period since the passing of the Act of 1921, automatic machinery has been installed to an increasing extent, and devices have been introduced aimed at obtaining the maximum degree of perfection in the British product.   We have been assured by large users of latch needles that the quality of British latch needles is all that can be desired.113.    Unfortunately foreign competition has been responsible for a diminution in the output of latch needless since 1922, notwithstanding that the capacity of the British machines has been considerably increased since that date.     The output by the same six firms which was  in excess of 28 millions in the year ending September 1922 fell in the year ending September 1924 to 27 millions, and in the year ending September 1925, to less than 21 million latch needles of all gauges.      In the case of two of these factories specially equipped to manufacture fine gauge needles of 48 gauge and finer, sales steadily increased up to the year ending September 1924.     For the year ending September 1925, however, foreign competition reduced their output by more than 50 per cent. In the calendar year 1924 the total imports of latch needles were 22.2 millions of which 15.8 millions came from Germany. In the year 1925 the total imports rose to 29.6 millions of which 19.4 millions were imported from Germany.
HOSIERY LATCH NEEDLES. (CONTD.)114.    Prices of latch needles have fallen since the safeguarding duty was imposed, for example, from 130/- per thousand in September 1921, to 110/- per thousand In September 1925, for a needle of 48 gauge.     The price of the British product is, however, still so far above the figure at which latch needles are imported into this country from Germany that competition from that country is very seriously threatening the existence of the home latch needle industry.     The average of a number of recent quotations of German needles of the same 48 gauge pattern already referred to is 63/4fd., or 84/6d.  inclusive of duty.     The rates of wages paid in this industry in Germany appear to be very much less than in this country, and, so long as wages form such a high proportion of the cost of production of latch needles -approximately, we understand, 80 per cent. - it appears to be inevitable that the output of British needles must continue to decline unless a rate of duty is imposed which v/ill more nearly compensate for the labour advantage possessed by the foreign manufacturers.     During the period that the home production of fine gauge latch needles was inadequate the German price of this class of needle was kept at a high level? but later the competition was extended to all gauges, and the effect is to be seen in the steadily increasing imports of latch needles from Germany during the last four years accompanied by a steadily falling average import price&apos; per thousand.     The German manufacturers appear to he making every effort to regain the virtual monopoly formerly enjoyed by them,115.    Competition is also being felt on a less scale from the United States of America and from Canada, hut the
HOSIERY LATCH NEEDLES  (CONTD.) .British price is somewhat below that of imports from either country.   These imports are, we understand, in some degree the result of requirements by American hosiery machine makers that American latch needles should be used in the machines sold In this country.116. Our review of this industry leads us to the conclusion that the duty has had the effect for which it was designed, namely to keep this key Industry in being&apos; after the War.   We consider that there is a good case for renewing the duty so as to assist   the industry to consolidate itself.We  are of opinion, further, that the question of the desirability of increasing the rate of duty so as more nearly to- counterbalance the labour advantage possessed by the continental manufacturers should be eonsidered,METALLIC TUNGSTEN. FERRO-TUNGSTEN AND MANUFACTURED products of METALLIC TUNGSTEN. AND COMPOUNDS  (NOT INCLUDING ORES ORMINERALS) OF THORIUMf CERIUM. AND THE OTHER RARE EARTH METALS.(&amp;) Metallic tungsten, ferro-tungsten and manufactured products of metallic tungsten.117. Tungsten is one of the comparatively rare metals,which has up to the present found somewhat limited but never-theless extremely important applications.   The chief ore *f the metal is wolfram, large supplies of which are available withinthe British Empire.   It is consumed either In the form oftungsten powder or of its all*y with iron, ferro-tungstenmainly in the manufacture of high speed steel used for theconstruction of machine tools. Tungsten steel has the propertyof enabling cutting tools constructed from it to retain theircutting edge even at the high temperature which high speedmaohine tools at tain.This use makes tungsten of great Importance in
TUNGSTEN ETC.   (CONTD.)the manufacture of munitions for war purposes and of considerable value in engineering work in normal times.   Tungsten steels are also used for the manufacture of permanent magnets and for some other purposes in whioh specially hard steel is required.     Other uses of tungsten which, though very important consume much less of the metal, are in the manufacture of metallic tungsten filaments for use in electric incandescent lamps and wireless valves,  and for the manufacture of electrodes for X-ray tubes.    The manufacture of tungsten filaments for electric lamps has become an established industry in this country,  and the use of electric metal filament lamps for such &apos; war purposes as transport, naval and military signalling, factory lighting and flashlight torches for troops, and for normal peace requirements is very extensive and is ever growing,118,   Although the use of tungsten for the manufacture of high speed steel came gradually into use towards the end of the last century the whole of the world&apos;s consumption prior to the year 1914 was obtained from Germany, where alone the ore imported from countries within the British Empire and elsewhere was smelted.   Attempts had been made to initiate tungsten manufacture in this oountry but had failed in face of severe competition from the country having the monopoly of supply.    The outbreak of war necessitated manufacture on an extensive scale in this country, and also in others such as the United States,  Prance, Italy and Japan.   New sources of supply of ore were sought for, and discovered on a large scale in China.119.   During 1919 prices of tungsten fell considerably owing to the large stocks existing at the close of hostilities,
TUBGS TEN ETC,   (OONTD.)and following a short boom period in the following year again slumped at the end of the year 1921 and early in 1922 to about one-third of the pre-war level.     During the year 1922 existing stocks of tungsten in this country were for the most part disposed of to the United States consequent on an impending tariff in that country.120.   At the commencement of the year 1923 the low cost of wolfram made the cost o^ manufacture of metal from the ore a relatively high proportion   of the total cost of the metal, and even with the safeguarding duty it was with difficulty that foreign competition In tungsten could be mot.     However, in preference to obtaining supplies of tungsten from the continent as had been necessary prior to 1914, It was decided to re-open the largest or? the factories which had manufactured tungsten during the war, and which had ceased to manufacture during the year 1922.     Since that time the total annual production of tungsten and ferro-tungsten by the several firms now engaged in manufacture has increased year by year. It has thereby proved possible to manufacture other ferro-alloys also on a commercial basis, and owing to the high quality of the British products even to make sales of these and of ferro-tungsten to the continent in competition with foreign makers,121.   Ilth regard to the quality of the British article the evidence of large users indicates that British tungsten and ferro-tungsten is inferior to that of no foreign makers. Most of the foreign makers of ferro-tungsten manufacture the alloy in electric furnaces which results in a less pure product than that manufactured in England by another method. The superior quality of the high speed steel produced by means of the British alloy or tungsten powder enables it to compete
TURGSTEN 3TC.  ( OONTD ,) -in some degree with foreign tungsten steel produced at a lower cost.122.    Prices of tungsten and ferro-tungsten have advanced somewhat on the slump prices in operation at the end of the year 1921,  conseqxient on the Improved demand for those substances, but are still well below the pre-war level, and internal competition between the several British makers of ferro-tungsten prevents the price of the alloy to steel makers rising to any serious extent.     In spite of the increased demand since the year 1921, the current prioe to home users is still much less than 35^3 per icent. in advance of the price at the end of September 1921, when the Safeguarding of Industries Act became operative.123.   We have no reason to believe that tungsten is not to the same extent as ever an essential ingredient in the manufacture c-f high speed steel,     The growing use of tungsten filament lamps has already been referred to.   ice regard it as essential that such important industries should not be dependent for their material on foreign manufacturers.124,   As already explained the actual cost of smelting tungsten from its ore is when low prices rule for ore, a large proportion of the total cost of the metal,     Continental methods of production are cheaper and labour is less expensive. These factors, among others, would have prevented the British makers of tungsten and ferro-tungsten initiating and continuing manufacture in the absence of the protecting duty.     The comparatively small normal demand serves to increase unduly overhead charges in the industry unless the manufacture of other ferro-alloys can be also conducted at the same works.. Any measure consequently which militated against production of
ferro-tungsten would likewise prevent the manufacture of the other ferro-alloys,125,   ?vre are of opinion, having regard to what has been already said of the great importance of the industry,  that the manufacture of tungsten and ferro-tungsten and of products of metallic tungsten should continue to be safe-guarded for a further period of years until conditions are more normal and the British industry has become firmly established.(b) Compounds of Thorium,  Cerium and the other rare earth metals.126.   The only extensive commercial source of these corn-pounds within the British Empire is in Travancore, where the raw material, Monazite Sand, is mined by a British Company and Imported into this country to be worked up by them into the rare   earth compounds.    Chief among these are thorium and cerium nitrates employed in the manufacture of incandescent gas mantles,  cerium fluoride essential for flame arcs required for searchlight purposes in time of war, and mesothorium used as a radium substitute in the manufacture of luminous compounds for use on gun-sights, recording apparatus on aeroplanes,  compasses, and other instruments.   Thorium compounds are also used in the manufacture of certain types of wireless reoelving and transmitting valves.   Cerium compounds also find application as catalysts and oxidising agents In organic chemical reactions,  and have some use in medicine,127,   Before the war Germany had almost a monopoly of the thorium nitrate market, and the Industry established in this country during the war had to meet severe German competition at the close of hostilities.    That competition was intensified by the depreciation of the mark and the possession of
COMPOUNDS OF THORIUM, ETC.  (oontd.)accumulated stocks of thorium residues from war manufactures, which the German manufacturers were able to write down to a merely nominal value and use as their raw material.   The passing of the Act 1921 gave some assistance to the Industry, but competition was so severe as to reduce very seriously the manufacture in this country.   Experiments directed towards improvement in the efficiency of the British industry yielded results which enabled works shut down in the year 1922 to be re-opened at the end of 1923.    German competition, however, forced the price of Thorium Nitrate to even below its pre-war figure.    The British industry has, nevertheless, owing to the duty of SS-^/S per cent, been able to continue manufacture despite all the efforts of foreign competitors to prevent it. The output has considerably increased over that in 1921 and the price at the end of 1925 had fallen to 13/3d. per kilo, compared with a figure of 22/6d. in 1921,128. At the present time foreign competition Is most severely felt from France with Its very depreciated franc, low labour costs and cheaper raw materials, and the position of the British manufacturer of thorium nitrate is thereby rendered very precarious.129. The prosperity of the Thorium nitrate and rare earth Industry in this country ie dependent on an adequate home production of gas mantles, and It is possible that some degree of Improvement in the thorium industry may be effected in the future from that source,130. The industry in this country has, it would appear, now arrived at a stage of efficiency which would enable it under equal conditions to compete successfully against any foreign makers without assistance.   Until such time, however,
COMPOUNDS, OF THORIUM, ETC.  (Contd.)   ...        jgg as the present abnormal conditions on the continent are removed, the safeguarding already afforded will require, we consider, to be renewed.ALL SYNTHETIC ORGANIC CHEMICALS (OTHER THAN SYNTHETIC ORGANIC DYESTUFPS,,. COLOURS,  AND COLOURING MATTERS IMPORTED FOR USE AS SUCH, AND ORGANIC INTERMEDIATE PRODUCTS IMPORTED FOR THEIR MANUFACTURE) ANALYTICAL RE-AGENTS, ALL OTHER FINE CHEMICALS . (EXCEPT SULPHATE OF QUININE OF VEGETABLE ORIGIN) AND CHEMICALS MANUFACTURED BY FSRMEHTATIO.N PROCESSES.131, For a long period of years prior to 1914, the British chemical industry had primarily devoted itself to the manufacture-ture of the heavy chemicals, used. In general, In large quantities for industrial processes, and as a rule   not of the highest degree of purity.   In this branch of manufacture the United Kingdom was probably, on the whole, ahead, of any other nation.   With regard, however, to the so-called &apos;fine&apos; chemicals a very limited number were manufactured in this country and mostly In small quantities.   When chemical substances for use In analytical or research work, or for pharmaceutical, photo-graphic or certain less common industrial purposes were required it was in the main to continental manufacturers that the orders went.   The range of products was very limited and such fine &apos; chemicals and other analytical re-agents as were made in this country were not held in such high repute as those of foreign makers.132. With regard to synthetic organic chemical compounds pother than dyestuffs and intermediate products which are covered by the Dyestuffs (import Regulation) Act, 1920/ this country was also far behind the foremost continental manufacturers and&apos;the wide range of synthetic products which came so largely into use In medical and surgical science during the early part of the present century was&apos; almost exclusively the output of the continental chemical industry.
CHEMICALS (contd. )135.    The outbreak of the late war made the development In this country of these branches of the chemical industry essential.    British chemical manufacturers were called upon to supply in large quantities and in ever increasing variety rubs tances not previously manufactured here, for example import-ant drugs such as aspirin, local anaesthetics such as novocalne, photographic developers and sensitisers indispensable for aerial photography and X-ray work in hospitals, and many others for use in the national crisis.    This was accomplished with a very considerable degree of success, but not without serious delay which would have been avoided if a fins chemical industry comparable in magnitude with that on the continent had existed in this country.134. The chemical portion of the Schedule to the Safeguarding of Industries Act was consequently drafted with the object of securing, if possible, that the United Kingdom should In the future bo independent of foreign manufacturers for those chemical substances on which the very existence of the nation depends.    By this means also an outlet would be made available for the trained chemists of the milversities to a degree more In keeping tham formerly with the importance of the United Kingdom among coimtries of scientific repute.135. Cur review of the sections of the chemical industry now in question proves conclusively that very considerable advances towards the desired goal have been made.    In this as in the other branches of manufacture to which we have referred earlier in this Report,, the safeguarding duty has not had the effect of inclining British manufacturers to be content with the progress made during the period of emergency.    The impetus given during the war has continued since, and the protection afforded by the Act of 1921 has had the effect of placing the
CHEMICALS (oontd. )British synthetic organic and fine chemical industry on a basis more nearly comparable with that of its keenest competitors than ever before.136. Compounds never previously manufactured in this country can now be produced in quantities sufficient not only for all home requirements but also for a considerable export trade.    The case of the class of cyanine dyes used In the preparation of panchromatic plates may be quoted.    Before the war the cyanines were made In Germany alone.A British firm is now manufacturing the old cyanines and certain new ones discovered as a result of British research work, and has indeed now built up an export trade.137. Existing conditions abroad however in many cases seriously reduce the output which would otherwise be possible, raetol for example, formerly a product of the continental chemical industry, can now be made here in ample quantity. When the mark was at its lowest the corresponding German product could be sold here, duty paid, below British costs of production/- and at present a similar condition of things obtains with regard to French products.    When German manufacturers had a monopoly of metol manufacture in 1913, the price, even to professional photographers, was 21/-per lb.   Now that the monopoly Is broken the British market price has fallen to 9/- per lb.138. The new industrial research laboratories which have been built since the passing of the Act of 1921, and the investigations which have been pursued, have led to a very large number of similar instances in which a foreign monopoly has been broken and fine chemicals produced in this country which the considerable number of consumers1
CHEMICALS (CONTD. ) -        &amp;Q9opinions made available to us indicate to be in most instances quite equal in quality to the best foreign produots. In one or two instances it has been represented to us, however,  that it would be advantageous if British analytical reagents and chemical substances used for research purposes were more generally accompanied by a statement of the nature and percentage of the impurities present.139. One firm which now produces approximately 1,500 different substances, is understood to be adding to its output about 100 new producto per annum.    In 1913 the number of substances comprised in List H,- the list issued by the Board of Trade of the substances within the scope of the chemical portion of the Schedule to the Act, - which were made by 16 British manufacturers was approximately 1,330 out of a total of nearly 5,000.    In 1922 about 1,500 such substances appear to have been made in this country, whilst at the end of 1925 the same 16 firms with 6 others who have since commenced the manufacture of this class of chemical compounds, were responsible for some 2,400 products included in List H.    These are being added to year by year.140.    We are further informed that several of the British manufacturers now habitually undertake the preparation of chemical substances not in their lists but which are required for research purposes by the universities and Government Departments.141.    The research prosecuted in the industry has also been directed towards methods of mass production of substances hitherto made in small quantities^ towards the economically very important problem of profitable utilisation of the by-products obtained in the manufacture of important chemical compounds, and also In the direction of discovering alternative commercial processes for making the same product which avoid dependence on the same raw material.     Nor should reference be omitted to the very important branch of research which has
CHEMICALS (CONTD.)been continually requisite in order to discover the cheaper methods or manufacture necessary to enable our manufacturers to sell their products against foreign competition which is the result of labour and other economic conditions not paralleled in this country.14S. The research facilities which the Act of 1921 has made possible have had many valuable applications in the manufacture of products on a commercial basis. Acetoacetic and oxalacetic esters valuable in the synthetio drug, dyestuff and other Industries and hitherto made only on a small scale, have been manufactured by mass production methods.    Isopropyl alcohol is now being produced catalytioally from aoetone on a comparatively large scale. Cyclohexanol and cyolohexanone are being produced on a commercial scale as the outcome of research work which but for the Act would probably not have been practicable, and the same is true of synthetio thymol and synthetic menthol. When hexylresorcinol, a valuable internal disinfectant, was first discovered abroad considerable research was necessary to enable the large scale manufacture to be carried out in this country.    This, was, however, successfully accomplished, and the product placed on the market.    Diphenylguanidine, an important rubber accelerator, was also successfully manufactured in this country.    In the case of insulin very careful research was required to make practicable its manufacture on a large scale.    As research facilities were, however, owing to the operation of the Act of 1921 at once available, extensive and cheap production was possible in a comparatively brief space of time, and as a consequence a large proportion of the insulin market of the world has been gained by British manufacturers.
chemicals (OONTD.) ^$4143.    The conditions already enumerated in connection with other industries which have militated against the full benefit of the Act of 1921 being obtained are applicable here also, and as already indicated depreciated exchanges on the continent have been the cause of or contributory to the fact of foreign fine chemicals being offered in this country at prices, even when the duty is added, below home costs of production.      Pine chemicals are used in some connection in most important industries, and the general trade depression in this oountry in the post-war years has served to render mass production of such substances, and consequent successful competition with foreign products, more difficult to realise.    In general every effort appears to have been made to reduce prices, and Indeed competition has rendered such reductions inevitable.    Over a range of between 500 and 600 chemical compounds of the kind now under consideration, an average reduction in prioe between 1920 and 1925 of 47 per cent. appears to have taken place.    In the case of some 240 oompounds Information was made available to us showing the fall in price between the years 1921 and 1925.    This disclosed an average reduction of 42.5 per cent. Individual eubstances show even greater reductions e.g. phenylethyl alcohol which was 100/- per lb.  in May 1920 is at present 12/- per lb; benzyl acetate, which cost 12/6d. per lb. in May 1920, was sold in November 1925 at about 2/3d. per lb.144.    Although great reductions in price have been effected evidence was produced which indicated that in respeot of some fine chemicals it has not yet been possible for British manufacturers&apos; to reduce their prices to a level which will enable them to compete with imported products even when the duty has been added.    Apart from the duty British products would in general still be undersold.    The combination of interests recently formed between the large
G  Bill PALS    (CON TP. ) German chemical firms will no doubt lead to still further reductions in the cost of manufacture of synthetic organic and fine chemicals in Germany.    In respect of the products already manufactured and the additional fine chemicals which are being from time to time added to the lists of British manufacturers the degree of safeguarding afforded by the present Act is in our opinion essential to their manufacture in this country. Whilst the synthetic organic and fine chemical industry has made great advances since that Act was passed, it has not yet reached the stage at which it can stand by itself.    It is evident that unless the industry is kept in the position of being able to compete successfully with foreign manufacturers, expenditure on new research, that . essential to progress, will necessarily be reduced.145.    A subsidiary industry of vital importance to the British synthetic and fine chemical industry, and which has arisen out of it, is that of the manufacture of the specialised types of plant required for the production of the innumerable varieties of chemical compounds made. Before the war certain types of plant, such as high pressure autoclaves, were necessarily obtained from Messrs. Krupp*s factory at Essen. This has now been in part remedied, and research is in progress directed towards improvements in the efficiency of the plant employed.    Only by the continued manufacture of chemical engineering plant in this country can the full fruits of such research be available to the British fine chemical industry.    Dependence on foreign plant manufacturers Involves the absence, in any future time of national emergency, of plant in ample quantity and variety for the manufacture of chemical substances required for national defence. The British fine chemical Industry has not yet progressed to a stage at which sufficient inducement is held out to manufacturers of chemical engineering plant to supply many of the highly
CHEMICALS (CON TP. ) . specialised types of plant required .   Such types are in a number of instances still obtainable only from continental firms.   Nevertheless many kinds of plant such as high pressure autoclaves, are now made by several British engineering firms and as the fine chemical industry grows and establishes itself on a firmer basis,  so also will that of chemical engineering.146. Employment in the industry has more than doubled since 1913, and at the present time the number of actual chemical workers engaged appears to be about 3,100.   A still greater rate of increase has taken place in the number of trained chemists employed.   The degree of increase in employment resulting from the growth of the chemical engineering industry in this country is not known.147. If the synthetic organic and fine chemicals industry is not safeguarded against the foreign competition which it is, as yet, unable to meet unaided, the training ground which is being gradually developed for the skilled scientific workers who would be required in any future national emergency would be taken away.148. It has been represented to us that, in addition to the reasons already indicated which have prevented the full benefit of the present Act being obtained there is the fact that the list of dutiable chemical substances issued by the Board of Trade omits a lar-e number of synthetic organic an fine chemicals which have been placed on the market since it was originally Issued.    Further it has been pointed out that any satisfactory method of safeguarding this industry should provide for new compounds becoming dutiable automatically without the necessity for any delay consequent on an application for its addition to the existing list.149.    vie are fully in sympathy with these ropresentations and with a view to meeting the objections raised to the existing method, we have carefully considered the possibility
CHEMICALS  (COM TP.) . of amendment of the headings in the Schedule, in so far as they relate to chemical substances,  on the lines of specifying for duty all chemical substances with certain specified exceptions, such as the heavy chemicals and others which it was considered!, unnecessary or undesirable to make liable to duty.    A Sub-Committee was constituted by us tc work out such a scheme in detail and whilst it was snown tnat such a method was quite practicable from a scientific standpoint, it still appeared that somewhat extensive lists of the substances liable to duty and free from duty respectively would be necessary for the guidance of Customs officers and the members of the public concerned. Moreover, it was considered by the Board of Customs that the method would entail such serious delays at the ports if adequate means were to be taken to prevent evasion of the duty, that it was very undesirable to adopt it unless absolutely necessary.150.    It is evident that a method which specifies all chemical compounds with certain specified exceptions as liable to duty would automatically include all new substances which were manufactured in this country, and from that point of view the method has much to commend it. The present Act, however, gives the Board of Trade power to issue additional lists from time to time as may be required and we think it essential, in order to carry out the intention of the Act, that the Board of Trade should make full use of this power and issue from time to time additional lists covering all such substances as may appear to be properly comprised within the terms of the Schedule. If this were done the outstanding reason for a modification of the terms of the Schedule disappears, and, having regard to the administrative difficulties inherent   in the method examined by the Sub-Committee, we, with sane reluctance, recommend that the headings in the Schedule
CHEMICALS (CONTD.) . in so far as they relate to chemical substances remain in the same form as at present^151. It has been brought to our notice that some difficulty has arisen in the administration of the present List H in respect of those chemical substances which are specified in the list as dutiable only when of &quot;R&quot; grade. List H defines &quot;R&quot; as signifying that the chemical substance in question is included only when it is &quot;pure&quot;, &quot;puriss&quot;, &quot;extra pure&quot;, &quot;B.P.&quot;, &quot;Ph.G.&quot;, &quot;A.R.&quot;, &quot;for analysis&quot;, &quot;re-agent&quot; or when it is of special quality for meeting special tests for purity, and not when it is the crude product.    In practice difficulty and uncertainty has been experienced in deciding whether certain compounds in a high state of purity, although imported in bulk for Industrial purposes, fall within the definition of &quot;R&quot; grade.152. We have been furnished with lists of some fifty chemical substances of &quot;R&quot; grade In respect of which It is alleged that importers are uncertain as to whether parcels imported for industrial purposes will be liable to duty, owing to the high degree of purity of particular consignments of the commercial quality.    It. has also been represented that in respect of products of &quot;R&quot; grade a clear definition of what constitutes that grade should be given in each case.153. We have given careful consideration to the lists and representations, fend recommend, that so far as concerns all the substances in respect of which the difficulty in question exists the Board of Trade should prescribe in each case the actual qualities liable to duty, or, alternatively, the highest standard of the ordinary industrial quality which Is not dutiable.
15 4. It has also been represented to as by the Importing Interests that in respect of imports of the commercial quality of all substances dutiable only when of &quot;R&quot; quality, serious expense for demurrage is liable to be incurred owing to the necessity for analysis of samples of consignments.   Similar difficulty is said to arise in respect of substances which are dutiable when manufactured by one process, for example by synthesis, or by fermentation, but not when made by other methods.    We understand, with regard to these representations, that the Board of Customs and Excise, are, in all cases where it is offered, prepared to accept satisfactory security for the whole amount of the possible duty against delivery of the consignment, without awaiting the result of an analysis.155.    It has also been represented to us by both manu-facturers and importers that the system of ad va lor em duties has operated unfairly In respect of the chemical industry, in as much as foreign firms having branches or sole agents in this country are in a position to invoice imported goods at a figure much below their true value estimated in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 (l) of the Act of 1921.   We are informed that a number of instances have occurred where the declared value was considerably below that at which the goods could be purchased in the open market in bond by a bona fide buyer.   We understand that it is the practice of the Customs in such cases always to endeavour to fix a proper value to the best of their ability,    but in view of the difficulty of doing this it has been represented to us that in respect of the most important substances enumerated in the list of dutiable chemicals specific duties should be -substituted agreed upon in the case of each chemical substance by the various trade interests concerned, and revised from time to time.
CHEMICALS  (CONTD . )156.   Serious difficulties with regard to such a suggestion appear to us to render Its adoption undesirable.   We consider that an alternative method by which the present ad valorem, duties should continue,   but be based, in respect cf the most Important chemical sxibstances, on wholesale values supplied to the Board of Customs from time to time, whilst preferable in some respects, would still be far from satisfactory.      On the whole, after careful consideration of the question, we incline to the opinion that cases in which the duty is evaded are probably so comparatively few, and the difficulties inherent in any alternative method are so considerable as to render any change in the method of levying the duty undesirable. GENERAL C ONSIDERATIONS .157.    In connection with the power of the Board of Trade to issue lists from time to time defining the articles which are to be taken as falling within the general descriptions in the Schedule to the present Act, we have given consideration to the desirability of modifying the nature of the tribunal now prescribed by Part I Of the Act.     Disputes that any articles have been improperly included in, or excluded from, any such list are referred to the arbitration of a referee appointed by the Lord Chancellor.    It appears to us desirable,having regard &quot;to the very varied and complex scientific questions involved in respect of many of the articles and substances Included within such lists, that the present tribunal should be strengthened.     With this object, a panel of persons cf special scientific attainments should be constituted by, and for each reference to arbitration two members thereof appointed by, the authority who appoints the remaining member of the tribunal or by the Treasury or by the Board of Trade,   We
GENERAL C reparations IDE PAT IONS  (CONTD.)consider that such tribunal should give one decision even if it be only that of the majority.158.   We understand that complaints have at times reached the Board of Trade from manufacturers that articles not made in this country and required for use In their manufacture have been included in the lists of articles falling within the general terms of the Schedule,      It has been urged that in these circumstances the consumer is required&apos; to pay more than would be otherwise necessary for an article required by him, whilst the protection afforded by the safeguarding duty has not served to foster production of the article in this country.     We accordingly recommend that Parliament be asked to empower the Treasury, if the Board of Trade on representations made to them by consumers of an article or substance are satisfied that the article or substance is not made in the United Kingdom in quantities v;hlch are substantial having regard to the current consumption in this country of that article or substance, and that there is no reasonable probability of its being made in this country within a reasonable period from the date of the representations in such substantial quantities, to make an Order excluding that article or substance from liability to duty for such period as may be prescribed by the Order.159.    It is provided by section 10 of the Finance Act, 1922, that where the Treasury after consultation with the Board of Trade are satisfied in respect to an article which is liable to duty under the Safeguarding of Industries-Act 1921 by reason only that some ingredient or part of the article is liable to duty under that Act, that it is
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  ( CONTD , )inexpedient having regard to the nature of that ingredient or part and to the smallness of its value in comparison with the total value of the article that duty should he charged under that Act, the Treasury may by order exempt that article from duty under the Act of 1921.     tinder the powers thereby conferred orders have been made by the Treasury and it&apos; is desirable that their powers in this respect be renewed.     We accordingly recommend that section 10 of the Finance Act 1922 should be re-enacted for such period as the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921, may be renewed and that there should be power to modify from time to time Orders made under the Section as thus re-enacted which power we understand does not exist at present.     Fe recommend further that the Treasury should be empowered to exempt from duty articles of small value falling within the scope of the Schedule which are not ingredients of or parts of other articles,160.   We have already drawn attention earlier in this Report to the large volume of imports which came into this country in the months prior to the date at which Part I of the Act of 1921 came into operation.     In the event of a renewal of the safeguarding duties before those imposed by the present Act expire, a recurrence of the flood of imports would not take place In respect of those articles on which the rate of duty remains the same.     So far, however, as concerns those industries where a duty is imposed for the first time, or is extended to parts of dutiable instruments,  or where the rate of duty is increased, or where the proportion of the value of the imported goods which is the outftome of Empire labour Is increased, a repetition of the undesirable rush of imports
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  (CONTD . )at the present rate of duty is to be anticipated, and would in large measure serve to nullify the beneficial effects expected from the higher duty.     The same effect is to be anticipated by treatment of the lenses of optical instruments as separatearticles for duty purposes.     We are of opinion, therefore, that steps should be taken to render operative all impositions, increases or extensions of duty recommended as soon as possible after the recommendations are first made public. PROPOSED ADDITIONS TO THE SCHEDULE.161.   We have given careful consideration to the desirability of including in the Schedule certain additional articles which might be considered as the products of key industries.     Only in respect of those mentioned below, however, are we of opinion that a case exists for inclusion in the Schedule.(a ) Dioptric lenses, unworked,162.    It has been represented to us by the Admiralty that the only firms in this country who supply the dioptric lenses re-quired by them will shortly find it necessary to close down that section of their manufacture owing to Admiralty requirements being insufficient to continue production on a commercial basis. Submarine bow lenses, the type mainly in question, are produced by highly skilled operatives and cannot be made with sufficient accuracy by men skilled only in the manufacture of ordinary pressed, glassware.      If it were possible to ensure that the market for the dioptric lenses for ships&apos; lights required by the mercantile marine were reserved to the home manufacturer it would be possible to continue also the production of the Admiralty requirements.     The list of goods comprised in &quot;List A&quot; issued by the Board of Trade as defining those falling within the portion of the Schedule &quot;Optical glass
PROPOSED ADDITIONS (CONTD.) and optical elements, whether finished or not&quot; includes a number of lenses of the dioptric type, which at present are only dutiable when &quot;worked&quot;, i.e. when the moulded or pressed lens has been ground so as to constitute the finished optical element.     As a consequence pressed dioptric lenses in an unworked condition are free to enter the country with-out payment of duty, and this.has actually taken place to a serious extent and at prices with which British pressed lens makers cannot compete.     The imported unworked lenses are merely finished off in this country, and the object of the Schedule and list is thereby defeated.163.     We are in agreement with the views expressed to us by the Admiralty as to the vital importance of the mainten-ance of this   manufacture in the United Kingdom and are of opinion that no amendment of the Schedule to this end is required.     The list issued by the Board of Trade known as &quot;List A&quot; merely requires to be amplified so as to be more -nearly co-extensive with the existing Schedule heading as regards the several types of dioptric lenses.     The heading covers optical elements whether finished or not, and un-worked dioptric lenses appear clearly to fall within this definition.     It may be added that such an amendment would include the dioptric type of lens which is coming to the fore in connection with daylight signalling on the railways, and as satisfactory lenses of this type can be produced here it should be possible for a considerable proportion of the requirements of the railways for dioptric lenses to be secured by British ,lens makers.     In that event a supply of dioptric lenses for Admiralty needs would be made still more secure.
(b) Amorphous carbon electrodes,164,     It has been represented to us that the manu-facture in this country of the amorphous carbon electrodes required for the production of special steels in the electric furnace is being menaced with foreign competition to an extent which seriously endangers the continuance of the British output.     The requirements of the Navy for special steels for the construction of ships and their, machinery, and of the Air Force for special aircraft steels, are understood -to be such that the provision of the necessary electrodes is regarded as a matter of prime importance.     We accordingly recommend that amorphous carbon electrodes should be added to the Schedule of articles liable, as the products of a key industry, to a safeguarding duty of..53V^ per cent ad valorem.(c) Molybdenum and ferro-molybdenum; molybdenum com-&quot; pounds ; vanadium and f erro-vanadium.165,     Reference has been already made in this Report to the great importance of tungsten and ferro-tungsten as additions to steel for the manufacture of high speed tools, : and to other very important commercial uses of tungsten. Since the Act of 1921 was passed, other metals and ferro-alloys have also come to the fore as additions to steel required to fulfil special requirements.166. Molybdenum has a similar effect to tungsten when added to steel for the manufacture of high speed machine tools, and is in faot in some instances used along with tungsten for the manufacture of steel for this purpose.    Molybdenum is of great value as an addition to steel which is required to wlth-stand very high pressures at high temperatures, and molybdenur steel has much greater tensile strength than the niokel steel -^dtherto used in gun construction.    This steel is also superior
to other steels in the manufacture of permanent magnets, the application and importance of which has already been pointed out, and It has many other important applications. Molybdenum has also proved of considerable value in the manufacture of certain types of wireless transmitting valves.167.     Molybdenum ore occurs in large quantities within the British Empire, but the metal or ferro-molybdenum has not hitherto been made in this country, save to a small extent. Most of our requirements are imported.     We understand that molybdenum, ferro-molybdenum and a certain chemical compound of the metal are all suitable raw materials for the manufac-ture of molybdenum steel.     V/g are informed that at least one maker in this country is contemplating an extension of his output of ferro-molybdenum, and we recommend that a safe-guarding duty of 33per cent, be imposed on molybdenum, ferro-molybdenum and compounds of molybdenum other than ores or minerals,168.     Vanadium has considerable advantages as an addition to steel for purposes requiring great toughness and torsional strength, such as gun barrels, automobile parts, and propeller shafts.      It is also employed   as an addition to tungsten steels used for high speed tool manufacture, the introduction of a small proportion of vanadium serving to reduce the proportion of tungsten needed to give the steel the desired hardness and toughness.     The addition of the element is made in the form of ferro-vanadium, but there appears to be no reason why pure   vanadium should not be substitutedif financial considerations demanded it.
169.   Vanadium ores occur in important quantities within the Empire and ferro-vanadium is already manufactured. In this country from the ore.   As already pointed out in connection with tungsten the successful manufacture of one ferro alloy is very dependent on that of others which can be made by similar processes, and we are of opinion that the manufacture of vanadium and ferro-vanadium should also be safeguarded.PERIOD OP SAFEGUARDING.170.   We have given careful consideration to the period during which,  in our opinion, it is neoessary that the safeguarding duties should be continued in order that the industries comprised within the Schedule to the Act may subsequently stand alone.     Manufacture of new articles and substances, and the change from small scale to mass production,  involve considerable financial outlay for new plant and machinery.   Moreover, in the case of new lines of production extended research work is in many cases required before the manufacturing scale of operations becomes possible.   Unless there appears to be a reasojoable prospect of establishing the new manufacture, or obtaining a large market for articles made by mass production methods manufacturers are loath to embark upon such new ventures. They need to be assured that a market for their goods shall be secured to them, so far as may be practicable, for such a period that the fruits of research may be translated into manufacturing practice,  and that a reasonable proportion of the expense of the research and new plant may be paid off without prolonged delay.     To continue a safeguarding duty merely from year to year without any certainty of renewal at the end of each year would,  in our opinion,  in large measure defeat expansion along new lines of the industries in question.
ti U 0PERIOD OP SAFEGUARDING (OONTD.)171, So far at least as some industries are concerned evidence is available of definite and determined attempts by foreign manufacturers to cripple the British output.     In these cases also it appears to us that a period of years during which a safeguarding duty shall be assured is essential to the survival of the British Industry.172.   Prom these considerations we recommend that in the oase of all the industries affected the period of any further safeguarding should be for a minimum of five years, and preferably for ten years.SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.173.   We recommend(I) That in the case of optical glass,  optical elements and optical instruments (a)  the duty should be continued, (b)  the rate of duty should be increased from 33/5 to 50 per cent, ad valorem,   (o) the proportion of the value of goods manufactured in and consigned from within the Empire which is the result of Empire laboxir should be raised from 25 to 75 per cent.,   (d)  lenses forming parts of optical instruments should be regarded as separate articles for duty purposes,  and (e) component parts of dutiable optical instruments should be also dutiable.(ii) That in the case of(a) scientific glassware, lampblown ware andlaboratory porcelain,(b) scientific instruments, gauges and measuringinstruments of precision of the types used in engineering machines, shops and viewing rooms,(c) wireless valves and similar rectifiers andvacuum tubes,(d) ignition magnetos and permanent magnets,

in this country within a reasonable period in such substantial quantities *(vii) That Section 10 of the Finance Act 1922, should be re-enacted for such period as the safeguarding duties are renewed,  that the Treasury be empowered to modify from timeto time Orders made under that Section as re-enacted, and that the Treasury be empowered to exempt from duty articles of small value falling within the scope of the Schedule which are not ingredients of or parts of other articles.(viii) That in the case of those chemical substances dutiable when of MR&quot; grade,  In respect of which uncertainty may exist as to whether consignments imported for industrial purposes will be dutiable, the Board of Trade should prescribe for eaoh substance the quality which constitutes &quot;R&quot; grade,or alternatively the highest grade of the commercial quality which is not dutiable.(Ix) That the power possessed by the Board of Tradj under the Safeguarding of Industries Act,  1921,  to Issue from time to time lists defining the articles falling within the general descriptions in the Schedule should be renewed and that the Board of Trade should make full use of this power.(x) That the list of optical elements issued by the Board of Trade as defining the articles covered by the Schedule heading &quot;optical elements&quot; should be amplified so as to cover all dioptric lenses in an unworked condition as well as in a worked condition,(xl) That amorphous carbon electrodes should be added to the Schedule.(xii) That molybdenum, ferro-molybdenum, molybdenum compounds other than ores and minerals, vanadium and ferro-vanadium should be added to the Schedule,(xiii) That steps should be taken to render operative all impositions,  increases or extensions of duty recommended as
