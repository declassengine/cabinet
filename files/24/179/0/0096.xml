Koto^by^Secreter^ef^Stato for Dominion Affairs.The encloses memorandum, written by Mr. P.L. MaDougall, the Australian representative on the Imperial iSconomic Committee, appears to me sufficiently interesting and suggestive to justify my circulating it to my oolleagues*L.S. ameey.Colonial Office,  S.W.1, 13th May, 1926,
f\ 9LOST OPPORTUglTiaS.At the conclusion of the war,  it appeared that thenation had realised the necessity for the general reconstruction-reconstruotion of Industry.    A very considerable amount ofwork was undertaken by the Reconstruction Commission.Owing to a series of circumstances, of which the followingmay perhaps have been the most important, no real progress has been made with reconstruction(n)    in 1919 industrial troubles occupied the attention of the Government,  employers and trade unions.(b)    in 1920 a temporary boom gave a false sense of security to those engaged in industry.(o)    in 1921 the slump oaught the nation unawares and further industrial trouble occurred.Whatever the reasons so little progress has beenmade on ideas of reconstruction that it may be said  thatthe opportunity, which appeared to exist at the end of thewar,  has been lost.    The blame must rest upon foursuccessive Governments.    It must also rest in a largedegree upon the employers and no small degree of blameattaches to the Trade Unions.themsolves.Ill SH. 0 PP OR TUNITY.Tho present is not a time for considering wherethe onus of blame chiefly rests.      The grave nationalemprgenoy. in to \ bioh the nation has suddenly beenplunged, must make everyone, who has the welfare of thenation at heart,  take stock of the position iii much thesame way as in the early days of the Armistice.    once again when this strike is over,  the opportunity will booffered to the nation of undertaking a reconstruction.
CJUSE..OE UNREST.A very small minority of Trade Union Leaders and an even smaller proportion of the rank and file may have entered this strike with the definite Idea of using it asan occasion for an attack upon the democratic form ofGovernmento    It would be absurd to suggest that this is thereal underlying cause why three or four million Britishworkmen are holding up the life of the nation^    Thefundamental causes of tha strike are two :-fa)    a desire to demonstrate the solidarity of labour.fb )    a desire to demonstrate the necessity of maintaining a decent standard of livingsTHE STANDARD QE LIVING.The ideal of maintaining for the whole of the peoplea deoent standard of living is more 3eeply held in GreatBritain and in the two predominantly British   Dominions -Australia and New Zealand - than in any other part of theworld.      3o strongly is this ideal held that  these throecountries have shown that they are prepared to sacrificefor this cause at least in a certain degree what theclassical economist would describe as national economicefficienoy.It would seam that the present crisis could well be used with most impressive effect by the Government and by tha party at present in power, if a declaration wero made by the Government and the party to the effect that they intend to do everything that is possible in order to ensure to the people of this country a progressively improving &quot;standard of living.In order to give any such declaration real weight it would be neoessary for the Government to go much further than a more declaration.    It would have to state what action would in its opinion be necessary if the nation was tp be in a position to improve the standard of living of its workers.
Q fi %m o &apos;jsNEC5SSARY ST:tPS.It Is saggested that there are three esay&amp;tial:(a) Industrial peace and industrial goodwill *The Prime Minister has devoted so much time and enthusiasm to these two points that it is unnecessary to elaborate them here&apos;.(b) Reconstruction.Although the Government  can fairly claim that the Electricity Bill represents the largest move in the direction of reconstruction, undertaken since the war, vet this is only a small beginning.      The Government might state that it was prepared to call upon the very best brains of the nation to advise as to vhat measures of reconstruction were necessary In the chief industries in order to ensure efficisncy.     It could be indicated that although owing to the crisis in the mining Industry, the reconstruction of the coal industry would take precedence yet there are many other industries that need immediate and full consideration.     There is the cotton industry-, which has been working short time for a long period.     There is the iron and steel Industry in which, overseas markets are being lost to our competitors.      There is the heavy engineering industry.     Even in the prosperous Industries, such as the motor car trade., there is enormous scope for Improvement in exports provided a satisfactory reconstruction is undertaken.The Government might therefore declare its Intention of setting up, as soon as the strike is over, special committees for each trade in which immediate  efforts towards reconstruction are considered necessary.      On these Committees both the empbyer and the employed would serve and the Government would be represented by the most able men available.      In order to give the nation the most
definite assurance that the reconstruction ideas would be carried into effect, the Government might give pledges to introduce legislation wherever necessary for carrying into effect reconstruction recommendations. MARKETS(c)    Given peace and goodwill in industry and a definite reconstruction policy, there is a third essential,  if the standard of living is to be maintained and improved.      This essential Is markets for fully manufactured goods.Britain attained great prosperity through becoming the world1s workshop and if she is to maintain in comfort her large population,  she must re-establish her historic industrial tradition.      In other words she must recapture the position of being the leading nation In the world, for the production of highly manufactured goods.It has become obvious that Great Britain cannot rely upon the export of coal and of semi-manufactured goods in the same way as she has in the past.      Sheltered markets for manufactured goods will thus obviously be of the greatest advantage in the re-establishment of Great Britain&apos;s position. The Government might give pledges, as unequivocal as those suggested in the case of reconstruction of industry,  of its intention to inaugurate a definite,   sustained, and determined policy of Empire development.      In other words it  should aim at developing the purchasing po?.&apos;er and utilising the standard of living of the British Dominions overseas.      It should, also adopt on a mere general scale in the Crown Colonies the policwhich has been so successful in West Africa and which has prove-1 so beneficial both to the native farmer and to British export trade.
fi A &amp;conclusion.It is probably inevitable that the financial strain and the wastage of the general strike will endanger the standard of living of the worker.      The Government cannot use purely artificial methods, such as subsidies,  to maintain these standards.In a declaration of policy such as has been suggested above, it could make clear to the  whole nation that the Government Intends to utilise the brains and energy of the nation to place national industries on a secure footing.It is frankly recognised that industrial goodwill is essential if standards of living are to be maintained and improved.      It is, however,  felt that  the Government in pleading for Industrial goodwill would, enormously strengthen its case if the outline of a definitely constructive policy were presented to the nation.
