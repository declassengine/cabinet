This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET. Copy No. Q qcp. 173(26).THE CABINET.pay of   service   personnel employed   during  an industrial emergency.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a Note which has been prepared in the War Office relating to the pay of      30 personnel of the Fighting Services who may be employed on civilian work during an   General industrial disturbance, and ask for a decision on the question of principle involved.L. W.-E.The War Office,27th April 1926.1. The existing Admiralty regulation provides that naval personnel employed on emergency duty during industrial disturbances shall receive extra pay at double rates in addition to their ordinary emoluments (i.e., an addition of Is. 6d. a day to an ordinary seaman&apos;s pay, 2s. to an A.B.&apos;s pay, &amp;c, up to 6s. to officers of the rank of lieutenant and above).Extra pay at corresponding rates was given to personnel of the Army who did duty in the railway strike in 1919, but the Defence Force in 1921, and officers and men employed on civilian work during the emergency of that year, were paid at ordinary Army rates. The War Office consider the 1921 course is the right one. Whatever is decided should be the same for all the Services, and the War Office have accordingly asked the Admiralty to withdraw their concession of special rates.2. The Admiralty view is that (1) the Government should not be open to the charge of supplying cheap labour, and (2) the Departments should not make a profit out of the transaction. There are difficulties in the way of paying trade union rates to the men employed and recovering from the industrial undertakings assisted (Naval pay is sometimes higher than trade union rates) ; and the Admiralty think their principles are satisfied by their existing rules, viz., Naval personnel receive Navy pay plus double extra pay and the industrial undertakings pay the Admiralty the civil pay they would have had to find if the work had been done by civilians.The Admiralty intend to issue extra pay not only whilst their men are actually employed but whilst they are held in readiness away from their ports or ships, the extra charge in this case falling against Navy funds without any contribution in compensation. They justify this by pointing out the unpleasant nature of the duty, the risk of obloquy, &amp;c, and the fact that duty of this kind is not contemplated on enlistment.3. The War Office do not think that personnel of the three Services should receive any remuneration other than the Service rate of pay for the work performed. The firms, &amp;c, benefited would be called upon to pay the Services full trade union rates, but as the cost of a soldier includes other factors than his pay, it is difficult to say whether the firm or the State would make a profit from the transaction.With regard to the argument that the duty is unpleasant and extraneous to the ordinary duty for which Service personnel enlist, the War Office consider that members of the Services can properly be expected to do their duty in times of emergency without extra pay.   In any case, all three Services must be treated alike.The Air Ministry support the War Office.(b2.6/17)   100   4/26   w.o.p.   2646Printed for the Cabinet, April, 1926.832
