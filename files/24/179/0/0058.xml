In view, however, of the completion of the report of the Committee appointed by the Prime Minister last summer, it becomes necessary for me to ask my colleagues to give further consideration to this question.consider and report upon any schemes which may be submitted to them for,special assistance from the Exchequer to local authorities in urban and quasi-urban areas&quot;.terms of reference and have come to the conclusion as regards each of them that it cannot be accepted, the main grounds of objection to the schemes which might otherwise with modifications have been regarded as practicable being that they would make the amount of any grant variable not according to the necessities of the different area but according to the policy adopted by the Boards of Guardians in those areas.The terms of reference to the Committee were &quot;toThe Committee have considered five schemes within theirThis point is of great importance for itcannot be doubted that the policy of a Board of Guardians, not only in the fixing of the soale on which relief is given, but in giving relief in accordance with that scale as a matter of course on application and without discrimination as to the merits of1-the applicants, and
in requiring or abstaining from conditions of relief such as the performance of a labour test, influences to a very-large extent the number of persons to whom assistance is afforded.The Committee accordingly report against the adoption of any of tho suggestions made to them, but they have included in their report statements which indicate that some of their members think that some scheme which is free from these objections could be devised.    These statements will no doubt be seized upon by the more energetic advooates of necessitous areas as a ground for urging the Government to devise its own scheme of distribution, and will make it impossible for the Government, even if suoh a course were otherwise desirable, to refuse the grant which is sought solely on the ground that no equitable means of distribution can be devised.I am clear myself that to make a grant to necessitous areas involves not only the payment to authorities whose incompetence or deliberate policy has made, or largely contributed to, their difficulties, but also the encouragement of those authorities and of others to adopt the same policy in their future administration.   Of these oonseqtiences the latter would be the more serious especially at a time when the revival of trade requires every possible encouragement.Moreover, it has to be realised that to give any satisfaction at all to the claims of necessitous areas, any Government grant would have to be of substantial amount. The sums involved by th^ several schemes submitted range up to over  5,000,000 and nothing less than an annual grant of
at least half this figure would be regarded as satisfactory by the necessitous areas.       It cannot be foreseen when such a grant, once instituted^ would be brought to a close, but it would certainly continue for a number of years and would tend to prolong the period over which pauperism in necessitous arose may be expected to continueiI wish, however, to make it clear to my colleagues that the advocates&apos; of the necessitous areas are able to present quite a plausible case.      They will cay that unemployment is a national problem and that it is unfair that the industrial areas which have felt the burden of abnormal conditions most sevei-ely should be saddled with so large a part of the expenditure vdalch ought in their view to be spread evenly over the country as a whole.,Since tho Armistice much has been done through insurance, and unemployment grants, and in other ways to&apos; &quot;spread the charge for unemployment over the oountry as a whole and considerable relief has been given to local rates by national expenditure on grants and pensions.     The total amount of assistance provided in this way is equivalent to many times the total amount expended by Boards of Guardians in poor relief and while precise calculations for particular areas are impracticable it is clear that this Government assistance must have been largely directed towards tho areas which claim to be necessitous.    The Government has more than done its share, and, even if the difficulties of poor law policy, to whloh reference has been Biade, did not arise, it would be very difficult to justify such a new additional expenditure as is proposed.,Moreover, the extreme steps which the Government have had to take to secure savings in other directions is an indication of the difficulty of making provision for this purpose.
There Is, of course, much to he said for a readjustment of the relation between national and local taxation and any consideration of this matter must provide for a distinction between poor and rich areas, but the problem must be looked at as a whole and the difficulties would be rather enhanced thrn mitigated by a distribution of money to areas which are at present necessitous on account of unemployment.In view of these considerations I recommend that the Cabinet, should decide on the question of principle that no specific Exchequer assistance should be given to local authorities of necessitous areas towards expenditure on. poor law relief and that I should be authorised when the matter Is raised in Parliament to make an announcement ta this effect.(Intd.)

report.To the Prime Minister.Sib,     : .      . -1. We were appointed-in November, 1925, with the following terms of reference : -To consider and report on any scheme which may be submitted to them for special assistance from the Exchequer to Local Authorities in necessitous urban and quasi-urban areas.&quot;2. These terms of reference do not call upon us as a Corn-mittee to deal in any way with the principles which should govern the grant of State assistance of whatever nature to Local Authorities. We understand that, without entering into any question of policy, we are asked to advise whether any scheme submitted to us can be regarded as providing a fair and equitable basis of distribution in the event of His Majesty&apos;s Government deciding to grant special Exchequer assistance to necessitous areas. The limited nature of the terms of our reference precludes us from attempting the formulation of a scheme of assistance independently of proposals submitted to us. We have, however, regarded the direction to consider and report on schemes as enabling us to suggest, if we were able to do so, means of remedying defects in the provisions of any scheme as submitted, so far as this may be consistent with the main structure of the scheme.3. Our terms of reference do not specifically indicate that we are to have regard either to any particular class of Local Authority (except that purely rural areas are excluded from our purview) or to any particular category of expenditure in our examination of schemes. They are conditioned, however, to the extent that they refer to special assistance; we assume the intention to be that we should consider proposals for the alleviation of any excessive burden which, under the existing abnormal conditions, may fall upon an area as the result of all its activities. Many local services are, of course, already in receipt of State assistance and we conceive that it is no part of our duty to consider the adequacy or otherwise of such grants in relation to the burden remaining on an area in respect of assisted services. The claim for additional State assistance has, we understand, arisen in the main from the increased burden thrown on local rates through the serious unemployment which
has existed since 1921. . Indeed all the schemes submitted to us (excluding certain proposals not falling within our reference) have been confined to the grant of assistance to Poor Law Authorities. We feel justified, therefore, in regarding the main object of any special assistance which might be given from the Exchequer to be the alleviation of the burden resulting from the obligations which have been thrown on Poor Law Authori-ties by the exceptionally heavy unemployment.4. We have not taken the view, however, that we should pay no regard to the total burden upon an area for all purposes. The extent of any special assistance, even if primarily measured by reference to the burden of poor relief, should in our view still be.conditioned by the ability of the area to bear that charge, having regard to the whole burden resulting from its total expenditure. In other words we should not feel entirely justified in regarding the schemes submitted to us confined as they are to poor relief as covering the whole ground. . If a heavy burden of poor relief is accompanied by a light burden for other purposes, we cannot conclude from a consideration of the former item alone that an area is necessitous in comparison with its neighbour.5. We think it desirable to make our views in this respect clear at this early stage in our report since none of the schemes submitted take account of this aspect of ability to pay. At the same time we do not wish it to be inferred that we hold the view that the schemes are hremediable in this respect. In view of the conclusions at which we have arrived on each of the schemes we have considered, we have not, in fact, thought it necessary to carry our inquiry to the stage of exploring in detail the means of adjusting differences of this kind.6. We have had submitted to us for consideration the following main schemes, all of which are, as already indicated, concerned only with assistance to Poor Law Authorities :(a) Scheme prepared by Mr. B. J. Johnson, O.B.E., Borough Treasurer of West Ham, and supported by various witnesses.(b) Scheme submitted by the Guardians of the West Bromwich Union.(c) Scheme prepared by the Guardians of the City of London Union.(d) Scheme furnished to the Minister of Health by Mr. Cecil Wilson, M.P., prior to the setting up of the Committee.(e) Scheme submitted on behalf of Parish Councils in Scotland.7. We refer at the. end of our report to certain other proposals which have been placed before us. In addition we have had submitted to us suggestions for the alteration and extension of
the grants &quot;made in&apos; respect of unemployment relief works, and the &quot;increase of other existing grants. These are definite!&quot; outside the .scope of our inquiry. &apos;        118. We turn now to our detailed examination of the schemes submitted for our consideration. We propose to concentrate our attention in the main upon those features of the schemes which appear to us to be pivotal, while noticing briefly other points of varying degrees of importance.1. SCHEME PREPARED BY Me. E. J. JOHNSON, O.B.E.9. We deal first with a scheme for assistance to necessitous areas prepared and submitted by Mr. E. J. Johnson, O.B.E., Borough Treasurer of West Ham. The scheme was most ably explained to us by Mr. Johnson in oral evidence, and we also heard the following witnesses appointed by a Conference of Necessitous Areas to appear in its support, viz., Mr. Will Thome, M.P., Mr. Trevelyan Thompson, M.P., Mr. William Preston, M.P., Mr. Arthur Neal (Chairman of the Sheffield Board of G-uardians),- the Reverend Walter Emery (Chairman of the Birmingham Board of Guardians), Alderman T. Hamblett (Mayor of St. Helens and Member and ex-Chairman of the Prescot Board of Guardians), and Mr. Ivor William Thomas (Member and ex-Chairman of the Pontypridd Board of Guardians).10. In addition we took evidence from Mr. Tudor Davies (Chairman of the Merthyr Board of Guardians) and Mr. Harry Evans (Member of the same Board), who generally supported this scheme. We have also been informed that a Conference of ^the Local Authorities of Glamorganshire appointed a representa-tive to give evidence in favour of the scheme, but, having regard to the evidence already received from that area, we considered it unnecessary to call the witness before us.Particulars of the Scheme.11. In a memorandum furnished by Mr. Johnson the basis of the scheme is set out as follows :- (1) To the Guardians of each Poor Law Area in which &apos;,&apos; the average number of persons relieved during the year &quot; is in excess of &quot; the number appropriate to the area &quot; there shall (subject to the limitations herein provided) be paid a grant as follows : (2) In respect of every excess case relieved 75 per cent, of either of the following amounts, whichever is the less: (a) &apos;&apos; The average expenditure per person relieved &apos;&apos; in the Union area; or(b) &quot; The average expenditure per person relieved in England and Wales.
57203(3) Provided that-- &apos;    -(a) *In no case shall the amount of grant exceed 50 per cent, of the &quot; net expenditure &quot; of the Poor Law Authority during the year ; and(b) If the grant as calculated is of an amount which would reduce the &apos;&apos; local rate &quot; to an amount lower than the &apos;&apos; standard rate &apos;&apos; the grant shall be reduced so- that the &quot; local rate &quot; is equal to the &quot; standard rate &quot; ; and(c) No grant shall be&apos; payable to the Poor Law Authority of any area in which the &quot;local rate &quot; is lower than the&quot;&quot; standard&apos; rate!&quot;&apos;(4) For  the  purposes  of   this   scheme  the  following definitions shall be applicable    -(a) ,.&quot; The average number of persons relieved during the year &quot; shall be the average of: the four quarterly returns of the Ministry of Health, issued during the year ended the 31st March.&quot;(b) &quot; The number appropriate to the area &quot; shall be calculated as follows :  Average number of persons relieved &apos;&quot; Populationduring   the   year&apos;   per   1,000&apos;  of of Unionpopulation in England and Wales Area.----- &apos;            x - -- 1 1,000(c) &quot; Net Expenditure shall be the net expendi-ture charged to.&quot; Common Fund as apportioned amongst the parishes during the , year, less . grants received under the Agricultural Eates, Acts.(d) &quot; The average expenditure per person relieved shall be the het expenditure divided by the average number of persons relieved&apos; during the year.(e) Tlie &quot;local rate &quot; shall be! , based on net expenditure for the year and rateable&apos; value&apos;of the areas as at 1st April.(/) The &apos;&apos; standard rate &apos;&apos; shall be the average rate in..the   required for Poor Law.purposes for the year-based on the total rateable value of England, and Wales and the total net expenditure in the same, year, excluding, any grant received under these regulations.* In his proof of evidence, Mr. Johnson says : &quot; The financial effect shown in this column (i.e., the limitation of grant to 50 per cent, of expendi-ture) is merely an alternative for the purpose - of illustration, and1 obviously, if the principle of the suggested scheme is accepted as -a basis for a necessitous areas grant, the same should be ignored, inasmuch as. it. is quite the common practice particularly since the war period for the Government to make a grant to all Authorities, regardless of their rite burden, of 50 per cent, upon new services.&quot; .-/;&apos;&apos;
12. In amplification of these notes, it was explained that the net expenditure of the Union for the purposes of the scheme represents the whole expenditure for Poor Law purposes in the area., including any current expenditure met out of temporary loans or overdraft, but deducting grants received from the State in respect&apos;of lunatics, etc., together with income received from other sources. Repayments of principal in respect of temporary loans are excluded.13. Following this basis, the local rate is the rate which would have been required to be levied to meet the whole of the ex-penditure so calculated, whether or not such rate was in fact levied, and the average rate for England and Wales is determined in tho same way.14. The average expenditure per person relieved represents the total net expenditure, calculated as set out in paragraph 12, divided by the number of persons in receipt of indoor and outdoor relief, together with the number of lunatics maintained in County and Borough Asylums who were chargeable to Boards of Guardians.15. Expressed more shortly, the scheme provides that a grant shall be paid from&apos; the Exchequer to the Guardians of each Poor Law area, having a rate in excess of the average for the country, in which the number of persons actually relieved in the year (including lunatics) exceeds the number which the area would have relieved on the assumption that all persons in receipt of relief throughout the country were distributed proportionately to population. The grant proposed is equivalent to 75 per cent, -of the product of the excess number, so determined, multiplied by the lower of the following costs, viz., (a) the average ex-penditure per person relieved in the area, or (b) the average expenditure per person relieved throughout England and Wales. The grant is further subject to reduction, if necessary, so as not to exceed the sum which will reduce the Poor Rate (calculated as in paragraph 13) in the area to the average Poor Bate for England and Wales in that year.Financial Effect of the Scheme.16. We. were furnished iby Mr. Johnson with a series of tables illustrating - the financial effect of the scheme as applied to the expenditure and statistics of Poor Law Authorities for the year to^ 31st March, 1925. It should be added that, in these tables, the excess number of persons relieved is based upon the average number relieved on the first Saturday in each quarter; in oral evidence it was suggested that daily or weekly numbers should be used. We do not anticipate that any very substantial difference in the total figures would arise from substituting the weekly figures (which are in fact available), since the average for the ^-ountry would also be affected, but it might rule out certain
. y)areas shown as eligible for the grant and possibly bring in fresh areas, while varying the grant to some extent in, other cases. For the purpose of our inquiry we have not thought it necessary to carry out this revision.17. The tables show that there are 90 areas in England and Wales (excluding London) in which the Poor Bate, calculated as already set out, was above the average Poor Rate for the country of 2s. 7fd. Of these areas, 34 did not in 1924-25 relieve a number of persons in excess of the quota for the area and are therefore ineligible for grant under the scheme. The 56 areas remaining were eligible for grant, but in the case of 15 areas the grant, calculated on the basis of excess numbers alone, would suffer reduction so as not to reduce the local rate below the average for England and Wales. The figures show that a limitation of the. grant to 50 per cent, of the net expenditure, if adopted, would not actually reduce the grant in any.area.18. On the basis of - a grant of 75 per cent, of the proportion of expenditure allocated to excess numbers (subject to the reduction mentioned in the preceding paragraph) the total grant proposed for the 90&apos; areas was  2,926,022. If London were included in the scheme as a single area, it would become eligible, for a grant of  1,258,594, thus making the total grant for England and Wales  4,184,616. Mr. Johnson, however, proposed that the London Unions should be treated as separate areas. In that case the grant for London would be increased to  1,608,151 and the total for England and Wales to  4,534,173. It should be noted that these figures take no account&apos;of Poor Law Authorities in Scotland.19. We append to our report the main table handed in by Mr. Johnson showing the areas which would benefit under the scheme and the figures on&apos;which the grant is&apos; based.Basic Factors of the Scheme.20. Mr. Johnson pointed out that the scheme makes no attempt actually to define the factors constituting a necessitous area, although much attention had been given to the question by the Conference of Necessitous Areas. It implies, however, as he indicates, that for an area to be necessitous two general con-ditions must apply, viz. :-(a.) Expenditure for Poor Law purposes in the .area must be in excess of the average rate in the   throughout England and Wales; and ,(b) The number of persons relieved must be in excess of the number appropriate to the area according to population.21. These are the basic tests which we propose to consider in the first instance. The second condition is, it will be observed, a limiting factor on areas which would be admitted under the first test.   We agree with Mr. Johnson in regarding it as the5720HA 4
central feature&apos;&apos; of - the scheme, and for that reason we shall examine it in some detail. Since, however, the excess number has to be related to the factor of expenditure per person relieved, it is necessary to some extent to take these two items together.Excess Numbers.22. We. are primarily concerned to see whether the basis of excess numbers, in conjunction with the average expenditure per head, is one affording a relative measure as between one area and another of the necessity of the area. The first determinant of the excess number in an area is obviously the number of persons relieved in the area. That number is, as is generally admitted, affected not only by the state of employment in the area, but by the scale of relief given and by the general adminis-tration&apos;of the Guardians. Any scheme of Government assistance must admittedly be accompanied by safeguards against mal-administration, and it is important, therefore, to examine with some, care the effect of varying standards of administration upon the number of persons relieved.23. We appreciate the fact that scales of relief are used in different ways by different Boards of Guardians, and are more ordinarily guides to a maximum within which relief may be given on individual applications. But, for the purpose of an analysis of the present proposals-, it is necessary to treat in isolation the effect of.a scale as such, and to assume for this purpose that, where.a scale of relief is in force, relief is uniformly and auto-matically given at the figure indicated by the. scale. The inferences which we draw as to the tendencies resulting from, the existence of scales will not be invalidated by the various qualify-ing factors to be found in the practice of individual Boards of Guardians. We have, however, excluded from consideration the effect on the number of persons relieved which may follow the payment of relief upon a scale equal, or almost equal, to the lower rates of wages in the district.24. It will be most convenient to consider by stages the variations in numbers and cost which arise from differing practices in regard to relief. In the first place, we will take the case where the scales of relief in two areas are similar, except that the maximum amount given to a family is, in one area, say, 38,9. a week, and in the other, say, 50s. Wherever the maximum is operative, and there is no family income to be taken into account, a difference of 12s. a week per family will be paid. In general, the maximum will only be payable when the family represents from six to eight or more persons. The increased cost per person would therefore be small.     . .25. Where family income is taken into account on a uniform basis, there will only be a difference in numbers and cost when the family exceeds the numbers which on scale justify the lower maximum ; i.e., if the scale in each case gives 38s. to six persons
1 country for 1924-25 as 2s. 7frf: We may link with this test the limitation imposed on the amount of the grant in. order to secure that the local rate, after crediting grant, shall be not less than the average rate for the country, a provision naturally following the adoption of that average as a test of eligibility.49. Mr. Johnson thus argues that: a prima facie case exists for regarding an area as necessitous if the Poor Rate for that area exceeds the average for the country. The limiting factors for admission to grant must, of course, depend largely upon the total sum which might be made available for distribution. If it were possible to give 75 per cent, of the basic figure for grant to all areas with a high datum line of admission, it might only&apos; be possible to give 50 per cent, were the datum line fixed at a lower figure. The fixing of the actual amount of the rate at which areas should, under such a suggestion, be admitted to other tests under the scheme, depends, therefore., upon a balancing of the advantages of giving greater assistance to each of a limited number of areas, or smaller assistance to a wide range of areas. We should, consequently, regard this feature of the scheme as being to some extent elastic and we do not think it necessary to discuss the particular basis selected.50. The question whether such a test, at whatever point the datum line is fixed, can work equitably and fairly as between Authorities has been considered on several occasions. We may instance the Minority Report of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws issued in 1909, which, in dealing with a scheme before them for grants-in-aid, included the following statement of their views :  It must, however, be borne in mind that any scheme of grants-in-aid depending wholly or partially upon the factor of rateable value can be fairly or properly administered only if steps are taken to bring to a common standard the various methods of assessment now prevailing in different parts of the country, otherwise equity in distribution will be impossible. The necessity of this reform as a condition precedent is insisted on by all the members of the.Royal Commission on Local Taxation in their first Report on Valuation.&apos;&apos;51. The difficulty in this respect was, we think, fully realised by the witnesses supporting the scheme, although it. was urged that the Eating and Valuation Act recently passed would, when in operation, tend to make it less important. Concerned as we are with the immediate future that legislation, whatever advantages it may have when in full operation, does not meet the objection to this test. We can only endorse the views which we have quoted above as to its unsatisfactory nature, but we must admit the impossibility of finding a substitute for this test.
Accordingly we would not think it right to reject a scheme on this ground alone provided -it does -not depend. wholly- on rateable value^ - . .&apos;..,-... .. .\ ,The Metropolitan Common Pooh Fund.52. As already stated in- paragraph 18 the tables furnished by Mr. Johnson were based on -two different methods of dealing with the London Unions, the first treating the London area as one unit for. the purpose of arriving at. the excess number of persons relieved, the second calculating the excess numbers for each of the twenty-eight Unions separately. In oral evidence, Mr. Johnson emphasised his view that under a system of State-grants the second basis would - require to be adopted, with the result that fifteen London Unions would receive, on the 1924-25 figures, a total grant of  1,608,151 as compared with the contribution of  2,118,751 payable to those areas in that year, through the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund. Two Unions which in that year received  94,1S1 from the Fund would cease to receive assistance as they did not relieve an excess number of persons. Mr. Johnson&apos;s proposal involved the abolition of that Fund with a consequent relief to eleven con-tributing Unions of sums amounting to  2,196,474.53. Mr. Neal did not share the view that the scheme would involve the abolition of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and considered that it would be no violation of principle to leave that Fund in being alongside a national scheme.54. We think it- right to draw attention to these views. The matter is, however, a subsidiary feature of the scheme before us, and we do not propose to consider it in detail. We gather that, in the main, Mr. Johnson&apos;s proposal is based on the view that unemployment relief -should be a national rather than a local burden, and that the maintenance of the present arrange-ments in any form would be inconsistent with that view. The discussion of this point would take us into a range of argument bearing upon the principle of State assistance towards the cost of poor relief with which ,we are not asked to deal. We content ourselves, therefore, with pointing out that a consequence of Mr. Johnson&apos;s scheme, fully carried out, would be to relieve those Metropolitan Unions at present contributing to the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and, if the grant were assessed on the same basis as is proposed for the rest of the country, to reduce the amount of assistance at present received by the areas benefiting under the operation of that Fund.Central Control.55. Up to this point we have examined the scheme purely from the point of view of its,more or less automatic working. In the course of Mr. Johnson&apos;s oral evidence, however, an
in the family the higher maximum will not affect that family. Above that point the higher maximum will operate in.two ways ; it will increase the cost of cases admissible under either scale, and it will bring in a certain number of cases ruled out under the lower maximum. In both cases the increased cost per head will be represented by the steps in the scale for more than six persons divided by the number in the family; again a small cost per head. -26. It follows that a higher maximum, taken alone, will cause an actual increase in the numbers of persons relieved only in such cases as are brought in. by reason of the family income being at least equivalent to the lower maximum, subject to qualification so far as it may be the practice of authorities not to give relief when the family income approaches to, but does not quite reach, the relief which might be given under the scale. While the number of such cases is likely to be small in relation to the total relieved, the addition to the numbers relieved is clearly disproportionate to the additional cost involved.27. A difference in the graduation of two.scales of relief with identical maxima will, given similar conditions of administration, in itself have no effect on the numbers except where other income has to be taken into account. The effect on cost cannot be gauged with any accuracy since it depends first of all upon the point at which differences in the graduation of ,the scales arise, and, secondly, upon the distribution of the persons relieved as between men, women, and children. There.will, however, naturally tend to be an increased cost per head under the more liberal scale. Where family income has to be taken into account the number of persons relieved may be affected, even though that income is calculated on a uniform basis.. A higher allow-ance for man and wife, even if accompanied by lower allowances to children, would bring in a certain number of cases where the family income equals or almost equals the relief receivable under the lower scale.28. When,  however,  we remove the hypothesis that the assessment of the family income is uniform between authorities, the position is obviously different. It is in this direction that the greatest possibility of a large variation in the number of persons relieved will arise. The administration of Board of Guardians in this respect varies widely, and such differences must be directly and heavily reflected in the number of persons relieved. .   ,29. A further factor of a kindred nature is the difference in practice regarding the payment of very small sums of relief to applicants possessing income to an amount very nearly equivalent to the relief they would receive under the scale adopted by ,,the Union ; an example brougjut to our notice was the payment of Is. a week to an insured man, wife, and child to bi-ing up the
insurance benefit of 25s. to the relief scale of 26s. In cases of this kind it is clear that there can arise a considerable inflation of numbers at very little cost to the Union.30. It was urged by Mr. Neal in his oral evidence that the Authorities which attempted to inflate their numbers through administration would have to be either fraudulent or foolish, or both. He submitted that to load their lists for the purpose of getting a grant would correspondingly load their local rate. In addition, they would be reducing the average cost for each person relieved, and this, being one of the factors proposed for the calculation of grant, would reduce the amount of the grant. Mr. Hamblett argued in addition that, as it would be impossible for Authorities to anticipate the average number per 1,000 of population who would be relieved, it would be a risky procedure to attempt to inflate numbers, and thereby cost, since the burden might, in the end, fall on the area itself;31. We will assume the case of an Authority taking account of family income on an unreasonably low basis. Where relief would be given under any normal scale in force, the result is to increase the amount of the relief without affecting numbers; (hereby the average cost is increased, perhaps heavily. To the extent, however, that entirely new cases are brought on relief, in general (though not essentially) the amount&apos; given will be comparatively small and the average cost per head, as argued by Mr. Neal, will be reduced. But since every family brought in in this way will count each dependant member as a unit for the purpose of numbers in the scheme, while the additional cost will be spread over the whole number relieved in the district in assessing the new cost per head, it is clear that the two factors do not counterbalance one another.32. For illustration we may suppose that an Authority relieves 6,000 persons at an average cost of  26 a head per annum, and receives grant in respect of an excess number of 1,000 persons. If, by a different calculation of the family income to be brought into account, it is found that that Authority relieves 7,000 cases, it may be that the additional 1,000 cases each cost only half the former cost, or  13 per annum. The total expenditure is then  169,000, or  2414 per head, while the excess number is 2,000. Thus the basis of the grant becomes  48,280 against  26,000. If grant were paid at 75 per cent, of&apos;the basis, the Authority would receive approximately  19,500 in the one and  36,200 in the other case. In other words, an account of an additional expenditure of  13,000 on marginal cases, the grant is increased by  16,700.33. This is merely an illustration of what is, in fact, a general process. Whenever numbers of persons relieved are increased by cases in receipt of amounts less than the original average cost per head, the reduced average cost can never be
&apos;such as to neutralise the effect of the increased numbers. We are concerned in this direction not only with the aspect con-sidered by Mr. Neal that of a deliberate attempt to swell numbers for the purpose of obtaining grant but with the working of the scheme in relation to the differences in administration at present existing. The particulars of scales of relief and general administration which we have obtained show wide variations. These differences cannot show clearly in the average cost per person relieved, because, as we have already pointed out, the policy which in certain cases reduces cost per head while inflating numbers, in other cases tends to swell the cost per head without increasing the numbers relieved. In the result, it is conceivable that m the example we have assumed above this counterbalancing tendency might maintain the average cost per head at  26 while adding 1,000 excess cases in respect of which grant would be assessed. Thus the position would be even more anomalous than in our illustration.34. With regard to the point urged by Mr. Hamblett, it may be conceded that for&apos; Authorities on the border-line of grant, it would be a risky proceeding to attempt a deliberate inflation of numbers by administrative action. In general, however, it is clear that, under the formula proposed, a large number of the areas concerned would be assured of participating in any grant given, and no restrictive influence of the kind he suggests would operate.35. This examination of the variations in numbers is by no means exhaustive; it takes no account of other limitations which are imposed by some Boards of Guardians in the administration of relief, such as the total gross income entering the household. We think, however, that it gives a fair indication of the ways in which a difference in administration can and does affect both the numbers of persons in receipt of relief and the average cost per person relieved. We would, however, emphasise at this point that the greatest divergencies in numbers and cost appear to arise from differences in the methods of assessing family income, rather than from differences in the maximum amount of relief given; in the nature of things the maximum can only affect a relatively limited number of cases.36. We turn now to the safeguards in this respect contained in Mr. Johnson&apos;s scheme. In the memorandum submitted to us it was stated that the scheme was designed automatically to overcome any objections that might be raised on grounds of the grant of extravagant relief through the provision that, the per capita rate applicable to excess numbers in each case should be the average cost per person relieved either throughout England and Wales, or in the particular area, whichever is
the less, and then only in respect of 75 per cent, of the resultant cost of :th&quot;e&apos;* excess number relieved.-.37..These safeguards are in our view illusory. We have already shown that a heavy increase in,numbers through a less stringent administration of relief may have the result of brinpiuo-down the average cost per head. While it is impossible to say categorically that those Authorities whose administration is most economical and efficient- have a higher cost per head than their less economical neighbours there, are indeed notable exceptions in , an opposite direction -in general, since the effect of too generous administration is to give small amounts of relief to a large number of people, the tendency is in that direction. In our view, therefore, the first safeguard of applying an alternative cost per head is not by any means certain to work uniformly in the1 direction, intended, and more particularly so when account is taken of the further causes of variations in the average expenditure per head to which we refer in paragraphs 42 to 44.38. As regards the second safeguard mentioned, we needi only say that, if the present burden on local funds of the whole cost of relief is insufficient to eliminate extravagance, we can attach no importance to the suggestion that the proposed limitation of the Exchequer grant to 75 per cent, of the basic figure calculated on the formula of the scheme will afford an incentive to economy.&apos;. 39. One further aspect of excess numbers remains for notice. The excess number of persons relieved in an area is obtained by deducting from the actual number relieved the proportion of the total number relieved throughout the country applicable to that area on a population basis. The effect of a direct increase in numbers in one area, from any of the causes considered in this section, is to swell the total number relieved throughout the country, and hence to&apos; raise the quota which each area must relieve before ranking for grant. But since such a local increase is spread over the whole population of the country in determining the quota, the result is to penalise those areas in which the numbers have remained constant much more heavily than the areas in which numbers have been inflated.Average, Expenditure per Head.40. In dealing with the variable nature of excess numbers, we have necessarily had to refer at several points to: corresponding variations in the cost for each&apos; person relieved. In the form in which the scheme is submitted there are, however, other important determinants of the cost per head which we will now consider.41. The scheme treats each person relieved as one unit. It is, of course, obvious that the varying distribution of persons relieved as between.,men,, worn en and children must directly affect the
$ average cost per head. The published figures of persons relieved show considerable differences in this distribution. This source of variation was fully realised by Mr. Johnson,- but since the data for allocation is lacking, he had no ready alternative open to him. &apos;,42. Up to this point we have referred to the average cost per head, in its particular relation to outdoor relief, that is the dis-bursements in that respect divided by the number of persons relieved; from paragraph 14 it will be seen, however, that the cost figure actually operative in the scheme is the average expen-diture per head as determined by dividing the total net expendi-ture of the area by the total number of persons relieved, including lunatics chargeable to the. Guardians. This net expenditure includes, therefore, the cost of institutional relief and of main-taining lunatics chargeable to Guardians (less the grant in that respect). Since, in general, the cost per head of these two classes is much above the cost per head for out-relief, it follows that, subject to the existence of an excess number of persons relieved, the formula is more advantageous to those Authorities who have a high proportion, of people&quot;receiving relief in institu-tions, than to those providing, in the main, out-relief.48. For example, taking Mr. Johnson&apos;s figures, in the Bed-wellty Union the number of people in receipt of institutional relief was 740 against 10,866 on out-relief, and the cost per head on the basis of total expenditure was, for the purpose of the scheme,  19 15s. Id., against ah actual cost per head for out-relief only of  15 16s. 8d. In Birmingham, on the other hand, where there were 9,147 in receipt of institutional relief against 24,872 on out-relief, the cost per head for the scheme was primarily  32 2s. 10d., against an actual cost for out-relief only of  15 12s. 9d. The total figure for Birmingham being in excess of the average for the country has, however, to be reduced to the average of  27 0s. lOd. for the calculation of grant.44. Every addition to the list of outdoor relief in Birmingham thus counts under the scheme for grant at 75 per cent, of (approximately)  27 0s. Wd., against 75 per cent, of  19 15s. Id. in the case of Bedwellty, notwithstanding that the actual cost of an additional out-relief case appears to be very nearly the same in both cases. While we recognise that weight has to be given in some way for a relatively heavier burden of indoor relief, it seems to us illogical and anomalous that the assistance in this respect should continue to increase as the number of outdoor cases increases.. ., .45. The varying effects on different areas which may arise in this way are emphasised when regard is had to the fall in the total numbers of persons1 in receipt of indoor relief which has occurred since 1914. For the whole&apos;of England and Wales this amounted, on, the 1st January, 1925, to- 18-1 per cent. This fall has been by no means uniform, and in a few areas an increase
in. the numbers ;in receipt-.of institutional relief is recorded.&apos; Broadly,., we think it; fair to-assume that the fall in tot,al cost (ignoring the-change.in the price-level) is not fully proportionate to the fall in. numbers, because of the standing; charges which must be met. Thus, the general tendency is likely to be a. fall in cost per. head. (again ignoring price changes) where the numbers in institutions have Increased, or a rise where they have been reduced. We observe that there has in fact been an increase in numbers of 13 per cent, in Pontypridd Union and a fall of 29 per cent, in Sheffield Union. -If our assumption be granted,&apos;it would follow that, under the formula of this scheme, Sheffield would tend to benefit in greater proportion than Ponty-pridd. Of the extent to&apos; which a fall may represent a direct transfer of persons from institutional relief to out-relief we have no definite information, but there are indications that this cause has operated in certain areas. So far,as this is the case, there is a clear benefit under&apos; the formula to an area which reduces the numbers in institutions in this way.46. Arising out of the considerable differences in average expen-diture per head is to be noted also the result that an area which does not actually relieve sufficient persons to produce an excess number within the meaning of the scheme may, in fact, be bearing.a higher money burden than an area which an excess number (combined with a lower average expenditure per head), makes eligible, for grant. Having regard to the many causes of differences in the average expenditure per head, we think it cer-tain that manj- disparities in treatment would arise under the scheme in this way.47. The only remaining point to which we wish to draw atten-tion in regard to the method of determining assistance to areas by excess numbers and average expenditure is that it takes no account of the differing burdens which fell upon Poor Law Authorities prior to the abnormal conditions from which the claim for assistance arises. We take it to be no part of our inquiry to seek to eliminate what may be regarded more or less as permanent differences existing between one area and another in the charge for poor relief.The Test of Rateable Value.48. We have dealt so far with the effects as we see them of the basic test under the scheme of excess numbers in con-junction with average expenditure. As indicated in paragraph 20 there is, however, a primary test, in that no Authority is eligible to come under the scheme at all unless the net expenditure in the area would require a Poor Bate to be levied in excess of the average Poor Rate for the country based on the total rateable value of England and Wales and the total net expenditure in the. year...    Mr. Johnson calculates this average rate for the
% entirely - new aspect was presented by a submission which he made in- reply to questions respecting the variations of excess numbers that there should be a measure of central control over the administration of Boards of Guardians. Taking the view that, other than through the District Auditors, there was at present no effective central check upon the expenditure of the respective areas on each case, Mr. Johnson thought it would be almost a necessity for a Government Department to fix scales of relief, varying with the class of area, and he agreed that such a step should be a condition precedent to the bringing into operation of any scheme of assistance. It is only fair to add in this connection that he emphasised the urgency of the need for interim assistance if the fixing of scales was likely to lead to delay in the adoption of a definite scheme.56. Mr. Neal, who gave evidence at a date later than Mr. Johnson and who was fully conversant with the views he had expressed, personally dissented from the view that, as a safe-guard to the Exchequer, the fixing of scales of relief was neces-sary. Indeed he considered . that to be a hopeless task. He argued that, for the protection of the Treasury, it was necessary to lay down that no expenditure above a certain point should count towards, earning a Government grant. Any expenditure above a datum line should be borne by the local ratepayer and he was not greatly concerned at what, point the datum line was fixed. In effect he advocated the fixing of a maximum amount of relief for the family. Eor the prevention of extravagance in other directions, he contemplated that sufficient safeguard could he assured through reports by the Auditor, and the deprivation of the Authority of grant if, upon inquiry following such reports, the administration was proved to be extravagant.57. The fact that the scheme, despite the various safeguards introduced, does not ensure the allocation of the assistance proposed upon a basis equitable to all Authorities appears, therefore, to be frankly recognised by these witnesses, although they do not agree as to the extent of the remedy necessary. The suggestions made are really . three-fold, though inter-connected1 the fixing of scales of relief; the fixing only of a maximum amount of relief for the family, any excess over which would fall upon the local area; and the carrying out of special inquiries into administration if reports by the Auditor disclose prima facie evidence of extravagant administration.58. With the second of these rthe fixing of a maximum -taken by itself we may deal at once. The whole tenor of our investigation of the working of excess numbers shows that the widest scope for extravagance arises, not by reason of an excessive maximum, but from differences of administration within the. relief scale itself,, and particularly in the varying assessments of the. family income to be taken into account in
determining the amount of relief to be given.   We cannot,1 therefore, accept this&apos;suggestion as at all adequate to ensure a fair basis of distribution.59. To be in any way. effective the fixing of scales of relief would require to be accompanied by rules regarding the extent to which account must he taken of any income which may be available in particular cases. Even apart from the almost insuperable difficulties of assessing suitable scales for areas of differing circumstances, we see objection to this course. In the first place, scales of relief, would govern only a part, though admittedly a. large part, of the expenditure taken into account in Mr. Johnson&apos;s scheme; they would clearly not affect expenditure other than on outdoor relief. Secondly, a scale of relief should ordinarily be regarded only as a statement of the weekly amounts thought appropriate as a maximum for the needs of single men and women and of families of varying sizes. The inevitable result of prescribing scales would, however, be to standardise the relief given without the exercise of that discretion which is incumbent upon the Guardians; their business is to consider the precise needs of each of a large number of individual cases, the circumstances of which vary in every conceivable respect. We regard the prescription of scales for the governance throughout the country of the relief actually to be given not only as impracticable, in which view we are supported by Mr. Neal, but as incompatible with the whole system of administration of poor relief.60. If we regard the scale, on the other hand, as delimiting not the relief actually given, but the portion of that relief which should be regarded as ranking for Exchequer assistance, we are faced with the impossibility of determining the actual amount of any excess expenditure to be disallowed for grant. A difference in scales affects not only the amount of relief, but also the number of persons relieved. Only in general terms would it be possible to say that the relief given by any Authority was excessive; the measurement of the actual amount of the excess would be impracticable since it would involve a certification of the reasonable exercise of the Guardians&apos; discretion in each individual case.61. These considerations apply with almost the same force to the suggestion that an ex post facto measurement of extravagance can be secured through the instrumentality of the District Audit which is applied to all Poor Law Authorities. Even if it be assumed that complete written records of the facts of each case on each occasion on which it came before the Guardians were available, it seems to us to be out of the question that the District Auditor could review so large a proportion of cases as would justify him in declaring the pro-portion  of the expenditure  of  the  Union which should be
 regarded as unnecessary and properly excluded from any calculation of grant.62. We have deferred up to this point the mention of an additional safeguard proposed in oral evidence by -Mr. Johnson and Mr. Neal because, in our view, it is intimately connected with the question of central control. In order to overcome some of the disparities arising from the test of excess numbers, the witnesses suggested that, where relief was given at a rate less than that directly indicated by the working of the scale of relief, such sums should be equated to a unit figure of cost. If, for example, the scale calculation of relief to a man, wife and four children is 40s. and the actual payment made is only 20s., we gather that that family would count only as three persons for the purpose of calculating excess number;;.63. We presume that this suggestion is intended only to apply&apos; to cases in which other income is being taken into account in assessing the relief given, since the adjustment of all items to a standard unit would yield precisely the same proportions as the expenditure itself. Whether or not it would be practicable to obtain the necessary data is doubtful. It is to be noted that the plan so far as it affects the local numbers would also alter the average number of persons relieved for the country, and consequently the basis upon which excess numbers are to be calculated.64. But the proposal goes no way to meet the fundamental objections to the scheme unless it is linked up with prescribed scales of relief and rules for the assessment of the other income of applicants. The cases in which the actual amount of relief given would require to be equated to a unit figure might arise at any point in the scale; if there were a difference in scales of 5s. at any point the figure for equation would obviously be 5s. more under the higher scale. Similarly the figure would be higher, and would thus the sooner complete a unit, where the practice in regard to the assessment of family income was least severe. We are not able to see in the suggestion any &quot;real safe-guard against the differences in treatment under the formula to which we have already drawn attention.Conclusion.65. We have now completed our survey of the material points arising on this scheme. We have examined the main tests applied by the scheme to see whether, in conjunction with the safeguards proposed, they can be regarded as affording a fair and equitable means of distribution of any assistance which it might be decided to give to necessitous areas. In our analysis of the working of the system of excess numbers in conjunction with the average expenditure for each person relieved, we have demonstrated some of the disparities which the scheme would
in our view produce as between different areas. Leaving out of consideration the question of the acceptability to Poor Law Authorities generally of the measures for safeguarding the interests of the Exchequer which have been proposed by the witnesses, we have reached the conclusion that no practicable measure of central control can adequately secure the end in view. ., .66. We harve, therefore, to report that, in our opinion, this scheme cannot be recommended as a basis for the distribution of Exchequer assistance to necessitous authorities. We would only add that we have throughout our deliberations paid special attention to the possibility of introducing into the scheme any amendments that might render it acceptable. Regarding, as we must, the System of excess numbers as the essential feature of the scheme, we see no possibility of meeting by amendments or safeguards the objections to which we have called attention in this report.II. SCHEME SUBMITTED BY THE GUARDIANS OF THE WEST BROMWICH UNION.67. This scheme was forwarded to us with the intimation that the West Bromwich Union had adopted unanimously a report of the General Purposes. Committee to the effect- that &quot; Government grants should be given in respect of the unprecedented burden placed upon the ratepayers owing to the necessarily large expenditure of Boards of Guardians in relieving destitution owing to the abnormal unemployment, and that such grants in aid should be made upon the basis outlined in the memorandum submitted.&apos;&apos;68. The memorandum, which was prepared by the Clerk to the Guardians, states that . the scheme proposed by Mr. Johnson would operate most unfairly and unjustly in many areas in which unemployment and the financial burden have been as serious as in the areas which it is suggested should receive Government aid, and adds that any scheme of Government aid based upon rates in the   should have regard, not only to the number relieved and the expenditure in connection therewith, but(a) as to adequacy or otherwise of the arrangements made to cope with the unprecedented demand upon the local rates;(b) the effect of the financial arrangements made to meet the exceptional expenditure upon not only the now past but future rates; and(c) the extent to which expenditure justifiable under normal economic conditions was either not incurred or deferred.69. The memorandum then urges that in the first instance the parish should be the unit of any scheme of assistance. on the ground  that &apos; adequate relief . in : one -parish may. be  totally
25644&quot;main tests to provide a satisfactory basis for the allocation of any measure of State assistance.III. SCHEME  PREPARED&apos; BY  THE GUARDIANS OP ;&quot; &quot;   THE CITY OF LONDON UNION.79. We took evidence upon this scheme from Mr. A. P. Griffiths, Chairman of the Board; Mr. F. H. Wagstaff, Vice-Chairman; the Reverend J. F. Marr, Deputy-Chairman; and Mr. Edward R. Woodward, Clerk and Superintendent-Registrar to the Board. We were informed that the Guardians had pro-ceeded upon the assumption &apos;&apos; that the financial difficulties in certain areas have arisen largely from the giving of outdoor relief ,to unemployed persons and their families, thus creating an abnormal expenditure from local funds to provide for what is, in fact, a national emergency.&quot; We quote also the following statement of their. position :  &quot; It is felt that any grant-in-aid given to necessitous areas need not be a charge in its entirety upon the Exchequer, as Poor Law expenditure from the days of Queen Elizabeth has always been a ratepayers&apos; responsibility, and further, that all sums from whatever source, provided in aid of such areas should be directly received and distributed by the Minister of Health, who should be furnished with full&apos;statu-tory powers to make regulations and conditions for the proper handling and disbursement of such monies.&quot;80. The witnesses emphasised the point that this scheme brought within its purview only outdoor relief, since they con-sidered that the maintenance of indoor poor had not given rise to the same financial difficulties as the outdoor problem and its cost was well within the capacity of the Boards of Guardians concerned. Holding that the total cost of outdoor relief in pre-war days was not considered to be an excessive charge upon the Poor Rates, the Guardians maintained that the Poor Rate to-day should, as a minimum, bear a charge equal to twice the cost of the 1913-14 outdoor relief, plus 75 per cent., and that only Authorities whose expenditure was in excess of this figure should be considered eligible for a grant-in-aid.81. Tables were furnished by the witnesses showing the results of this test based on the expenditure on outdoor relief. in England and Wales in the years 1913-14 and 1922-23 (except in London, where the figures are to 31st December, 1924). Out of 640 Unions in England and Wales, 187 would be primarily classified as eligible for grant, but this number would be reduced to 163 if excess sums below  1,000 a year were omitted. For the 187 Unions, the sum spent in excess of the standard amounted to  10,132,887.82. The definite proposal of the Guardians was that grants-in-aid not exceeding two-thirds of the excess sum of  10,132,887,.
should be provided,.partly by an equalisation rate in every Poor&apos;; Law area in England and Wales and partly from the Exchequer.. They pointed out, however, that the scheme was flexible and adaptable to amendment in regard to the amount of grant. On the basis of the figure quoted they indicated that an equalisation rate of 3d. in the   throughout England and Wales would pro-duce  3,085,323, leaving  3,669,935 to be met from the Exchequer; this was subject to an)&apos; other proportions which might be determined. All areas would contribute to the equalisation-tion rate and only those regarded as necessitous under the test mentioned above would participate in the proceeds of the rate and the Exchequer contribution.83. On the questions of safeguards to the Exchequer we quote from the memorandum submitted to us : &quot; The Minister of Health should be charged with adequate powers to determine whether or not any area is to be admitted to the list, and if admitted, as to the extent it shall participate in the Fund.It is not. necessary to enlarge upon this aspect of the posi-tion, excepting to state that central control is an essential element in these proposals.It is, however, suggested that adequate machinery exists in the department of the Statutory Receiver of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund and the Audit Department of the Ministry of Health to handle the administrative work of the scheme.- The Fund need not be inoperative until full audit reports are available, as facilities should be arranged for payments on account to be made during each half-year.Further consideration should be given to provide for cases of emergency or special distress in any particular area, where-by the Minister in his discretion should be able to add to the relief afforded, by means of a reserve fund which should be provided from the equalisation rate arid the Exchequer contribution.&apos;&apos;84. We deal first with the limitation of this scheme to expendi-ture on outdoor relief. In the course of.our examination of Mr. Johnson&apos;s scheme (paragraph 45) we have referred to the considerable fall since 1914 throughout England and Wales in the aggregate numbers in receipt of institutional relief. While in the particular form of Mr. Jobnson&apos;s scheme, the total expendi-ture basis without some correcting factor, tended, perhaps, to aggravate disparities, the exclusion of indoor relief in a straight comparison of loaded pre-war expenditure and present expendi-ture such as is proposed here is inequitable. It is obvious that ha the cases of Pontypridd and Sheffield, which we have instanced in paragraph 45, a considerable difference in treatment would arise. Moreover, it would, leave open an avenue of abuse in. a deliberate transfer of car:e? frcm. indcor-to outdoor relief.
85. The quotations which we make in paragraph 83 make it -abundantly clear that the whole onus of administering the grant is proposed to be thrown upon the Minister of- Health. We examined the witnesses at some length on this point. There appeared to be an impression that some indication of the quality of administration could be obtained from figures of average cost per head. This figure we have already shown, in our report to be variable in many ways; it could by no means be safely assumed that a high average cost was a sign of mal-administra-tion. In any event the measure of the excess would still remain to be ascertained. We are left then with the suggestion that the amount of grant which should properly be given can be ascertained through the statutory audit of the expenditure of Poor Law Authorities. This point we have already discussed in connection with Mr. Johnson&apos;s scheme and we need not traverse the ground again.86. In conclusion we would only point out that the scheme makes no attempt to estimate the ability of an area to bear the present burden of poor relief. We are unable to regard it as at all adequate for the purpose of distributing assistance to neces-sitous areas, and in these circumstances we do not propose to enter into any discussion of the proposal to levy an equalisation rate. That is indeed a matter which scarcely falls within our terms of reference.IV. SCHEME SUBMITTED BY ME. CECIL WILSON, M.P.87. We now turn toi a suggestion which was submitted by Mr. Cecil Wilson, M.P., to the Minister of Health in August, 1925, and which was referred to us upon our appointment. In a covering letter Mr. Wilson pointed out that his proposal, which he emphasises is only in rough outline, does not in any way depend upon rateable value, rates, or the action of local Guardians. &apos;88. Mr. Wilson suggested that figures should be obtained from the Ministry of Labour showing the number of insured persons registered as unemployed in each area., and that a necessitous area should then be regarded as one in which unemployment is in excess of the average percentage of unemployment for the whole country as notified from time to time in the &quot; Labour Gazette.&quot; For example, in an area where the total number of insured persons is, say, 20,000, and where the percentage of unemployed is 10 per cent, in excess of the average for the country, the total-excess of unemployment would be taken as 2,000. Mr. Wilson, proposed that there should be a Government grant,: per capita, for this excess number. .89. He suggested the allocation of the grant, at the discretion of the Minister of Health, in part to Poor Law Authorities, in part towards the cost of relief work, but to be so regulated that, as between-two areas with the same excess of unemployment,
that area which undertook little relief work should not benefit to the same extent as an area carrying out extensive works; The part not going to the Poor Law Authority should be divided between the Municipal, County Council and Urban District Authorities. Cases would arise where such areas were not co-terminous with those of the Ministry of Labour, and Mr. Wilson considered that it should be left to&apos; the Ministiy to say that, supposing there, is in the area of the Ministry of Labour an excess of 2,000, the allocation to the respective Authorities should be, say: Municipal area, 1,500; County Council area, 400; Urban District area, 100.90. It is not quite clear whether Mr.. Wilson intended that the area for which unemployment figures should be obtained was to be a Poor Law area, or a.wider unit. The areas of the Labour Exchanges are not in fact necessarily co-terminous with any Local Government areas and it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain the requisite data.91. Our criticism of the proposal rests, also, on other grounds. It will be observed that the determination of the excess of unemployed in an area, depends upon, the percentage of insured unemployed related to the number of insured persons in that area. Any insured person is free to exchange his unemployment book or to register himself as unemployed at any Employment Exchange he may choose. In the main the figures of insured persons at any Exchange represent the number of insured workers employed in that Exchange area. On the other hand, claims for unemployment benefit are usually made at the Exchange nearest the residence of the insured person. It is clear, therefore, that the percentage of unemployed to insured in any particular area must be accepted with caution. Broadly speaking, we may infer that wherever the domiciliary area is at all distinct from the working area, the percentage relation is upset. Many other factors may, and do, enter into the relation, but we need not pursue this point in detail; we have, we think, sufficiently indicated the unreliability of this percentage test for the purpose of allocating grant.92. It might be argued that this difficulty could be avoided by relating the number of insured unemployed to some other factor such as the population of the area; that is to argue that there is between the numbers of insured unemployed and the burden of relief falling upon the Poor Law Authority a sufficiently sympathetic relation to provide a basis for the allocation of grant. Such figures as we have compared indicate, however, that no general sympathy exists between the two factors, and indeed the views expressed by some witnesses tend to emphasise a contrary rather than a sympathetic movement.93. Although we realise the great advantages to be gained by any scheme based on data independent of the Poor Law admmis-tration itself, we are unable to see any possibility of founding an equitable scheme upon the basis proposed by Mr. Wilson.
V. SCHEME   SUBMITTED   ON   BEHALF   OF PARISH COUNCILS IN SCOTLAND.94. This scheme was submitted to us by the Adjustment Committee of the Parish Councils of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Goyan. We were informed that it had also been adopted by the Association of Parish Councils of Scotland.* We received oral evidence thereon from the following witnesses representing the Parish Councils indicated : Mr. John Kerr (Govan), Mr. J. Cunningham-(Glasgow), Colonel Young and Mr. Goodall (Edin-burgh), Mr. Crofts (Cambuslang), and from the Clerks to those Councils and the Clerk to the Adjustment Committee.95. Under this scheme it is proposed that any. Parish Council which disburses in relief (including administration) to the destitute able-bodied unemployed a sum exceeding the produce of a 4d. rate upon the gross rental of the parish should receive assistance from the Exchequer to the extent of 75 per cent, of the expenditure in excess of that rate. In addition it is asked that a similar grant should be paid in respect of past expendi-ture (from the 15th May, 1921) on able-bodied relief. In the form in which the scheme was submitted in oral evidence, the grant in respect of the expenditure of previous years was to be calculated, in the manner already indicated, upon the basis of the expenditure for the current year with the addition of the interest on, and capital repayments of, loans raised to meet expenditure upon able-bodied relief since 1921.96. A similar basis for the calculation of an annual grant was incorporated in a memorial submitted to us by the Gova-n Com-bination Parish Council. The memorial -further suggested that the Exchequer should assume responsibility for 75 per cent, of the debt, as at May, 1926, incurred by that Parish for the relief of the able-bodied unemployed. Mr. Kerr, however, stated in his evidence that the Council had decided to adhere to the proposals made by the Adjustment Committee.97. We were informed by the witnesses that in the calendar year 1924, 17 parishes would have required to raise a rate in excess of 4a\ upon the gross rental of the parish to meet their current expenditure upon the able-bodied poor. Complete details for the year to 15th May, 1925, had not been obtained, but a table showing particulars for certain Parish Councils was handed in, from which it appeared that the total Government grant on the basis of current expenditure alone would be  192,000 for 12 Councils, or, including loan charges,  477,000 for 13 Councils. The corresponding grant on the basis of the estimated expenditure for 1925-26 was shown as  316,000, excluding loan charges, and  638,000 including loan charges,* Wa were subsequently informed by the Clerk to the greenock Parish Council that that Council dissented from the statement that the scheme had been adopted by the Association of Parish Councils of Scotland.
one Council again being brought within the scheme only when loan charges were taken into account. &apos; 198. As already mentioned, these figures are not complete, but so far as grant in respect-of current expenditure is concerned, the addition to be made in respect of other Councils would probably not be more than  30,000 to  40,000 hr 1924-25. It is possible, however, that the inclusion of loan charges might bring in some Councils whose current expenditure on able-bodied relief does not reach the equivalent of a 4d. rate.99. It was emphasised by the witnesses in oral evidence that they were making no claim for assistance in respect of expendi-ture other than that, incurred on the relief of the able-bodied unemployed. In the main, this attitude appeared to be based upon the contention that relief to the able-bodied, which, prior to legislation in 1921, the Scottish Poor Law Authorities were precluded from granting, was national in character and con-stituted a charge which should not fall upon local rates. The witnesses stated indeed that they recognised the parochial nature of the charge for the ordinary poor. Their argument appeared to be that, while the. parishes had adjusted themselves to the normal burdens of poor relief, they were unable to carry the additional burden of the able-bodied unemployed ; that expendi-ture alone could, therefore, be taken as a measure of their necessity. At the same time, it was admitted that unemploy-ment, in addition to causing the new charge for able-bodied relief, had led to a large increase in the expenditure upon the relief of the ordinary poor. We are not prepared to accept the contention that an area becomes necessitous merely because the rate for able-bodied unemployed is above a certain figure without having regard to other considerations. We have already indi-cated some results which follow the adoption of a limited range of expenditure as the basis of a scheme, and we do not see how any scheme which takes no account of comparative changes in the total burden, but has regard only to the amount of a particular charge imposed since the War. can assess equitably the real necessity of an area, or measure the assistance appropriate to different areas.100. According to the figures supplied to us by the witnesses, for the year 1924-25 the Parish Council of Glasgow would, taking account only of current expenditure on the relief of the destitute able-bodied, receive a grant of  93,811, equal to a rate of 3-4d. on the gross valuation; Edinburgh would receive  2,589 or 0-ld. on the gross valuation ; and New Monkland would receive  1,041 or 1-ld. on the gross valuation. Taking into account all expenditure on poor relief in 1924-25, with the ex-ception of the charges&apos; on loans raised to meet able-bodied relief, the rates on gross valuation required to meet that expenditure would,&apos; so far as we can ascertain, have been 2s. 9-5d., Is. 3&apos;5rf. and 2s. 11-7(7. respectively.   We think these figures tend to bear
647-inadequate or excessive in another because of the varying retail cost of the necessaries of life, the difference in the average working-class budget, &amp;c. It is pointed out that under the Regulations made by the Minister of Health in January, 1922, fixing the relief chargeable upon the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, the maximum amount payable to the average family of man, wife and three children was 41s., and that the then standard rate of wages for workpeople of Grade A under the agreement of the London District Industrial Council for Local Authorities Non-trading Service (Manual Labour) was 71s., a figure, since revised.70. Basing themselves upon the argument that a scale which was considered equitable for distributing the burden as between the ratepayers of a large area like London would also be eqnit-able for distributing the burden as between ratepayers and tax-payers, and assuming that the rate of wages for workpeople of G-rade A can be ascertained for any year for every parish in the41country, the Guax-guardians suggest that &quot;TtJ&quot;^5 Qf the Grade A ratefor the Parish could be used to arrive at the amount of relief which should be granted to the average family of five persons for the years 1922 and 1923, a similar formula with the necessary revisions of wages rates being used for subsequent years.71. The Guardians then state that the difference between the cost of the maximum relief in every case and the total of amounts given to relieve destitution after the circumstances of individual cases have been considered may be taken to be 40 per cent. Combining both the factors mentioned they deduce the following formula, viz. : Average weeklyPm^ergLEE!&quot;^ x  Reljelfor m^wife  x   52 weeks - 40 7 5 and three children 10as giving what may be termed the &quot; standard relief &quot; for the parish for the year, over which any excess in the actual amount of relief given should be a local charge.72. The memorandum then suggests that when the actual amount oL,relief exceeds the &quot; standard relief,&quot; the number relieved must also be proportionately greater than it should have been as between one area and another. To meet this con-contingency &quot; standard relief &quot; should be reduced by a percentage equivalent to the percentage excess of the actual amount of relief. This final &quot; standard relief &quot; having been ascertained for each parish it is.proposed that the total for the Union, plus the amount of administration charges in respect of out-relief for each year, should then rank for Government grant. -173. The application of such a formula as is proposed in this scheme would yield a series of factors, ranging all Unions in the order of the amount of relief, that, in the opinion of the framer
of the scheme, they might reasonably disburse. A factor is obtained for every Union in which relief is given, however small. If the suggestion is that any grant should be divided amongst the whole of these areas and there is nothing to show a con-trary intention the scheme does not fall within our terms of reference, since it makes no provision for distinguishing neces-sitous areas from others. At the same time some qualifying factor might conceivably be introduced, and we think if desirable, therefore, to comment briefly on the main features of the scheme.74. The application of the proposed formula requires the use of rates of wages for workpeople of Grade A for each Parish in the country, and it is assumed by the Guardians that this information is available. The rates in question are presumably those fixed for their respective areas by the agreements of the Provincial Joint Industrial Councils for Local Authorities non-trading services. - We understand from the Ministry of Labour that, in fact, such rates are not available throughout the country, and that the following areas are not covered by the Provincial Joint Industrial Councils, namely: Cumberland and Westmorland; North and East Ridings of Yorkshire; Norfolk, Cambridge, Huntingdonshire. Bedfordshire, Suffolk and&apos; Isle of Ely ; Essex ; and the whole of Wales. The scheme, therefore, breaks down at this point. We are aware of no test available for the whole country which could be substituted for the Grade A rates of wages proposed.75. Apart from this practical objection, it seems to us that the proposed division of the numbers relieved into families of five persons would work very unfairly as between Authorities. The constitution of the number relieved is by no means uniform throughout the country, as is shown by the returns published by the Ministry of Health.76. We are not aware of the basis upon which the proposed deduction of 40 per cent, has been calculated. Even if it be granted that it might, on average, fairly give weight to the difference between the standard scale for relief and the sum which is required to relieve destitution, after taking into account the circumstances and resources of the household, it seems to us obvious that it cannot possibly work equitably in each individual Union.77. The assumption that when the actual amount of relief exceeds the &quot; standard relief &quot; the number relieved must also be proportionately increased is, in our view, fallacious. We have shown in our examination of Mr. Johnson&apos;s scheme that excess-sive numbers are not necessarily accompanied by a high cost per head, but rather the contrary; it follows that this test could not work fairly.78. In our view, therefoie, this scheme, apart from the-impossibility of obtaining the basic data necessary, fails in its
out our contention that the basis proposed does, not indicate at all adequately the relative necessity of Poor Law areas.101. Within the limited range of expenditure- taken into account, the scheme imposes a test of necessity through the fixing of a rate of 4d. upon the gross rental as the datum line above which grant should become payable. We have in paragraphs 50 and 51 referred to the lack of uniformity&apos; in valua-tions in England and Wales, and the unsatisfactory nature of the rating assessment as a test of necessity. Even admitting that the objections on .the ground of lack of uniformity in valua-tions apply to England and Wales rather than to Scotland, we have to consider the scheme in its application to the Poor Law Authorities of the whole of Great Britain, subject to such modifi-cations as may be necessary in England and Wales. The objection on the ground of lack of uniformity in the latter countries would apply with special force to a scheme! which depends almost entirely upon the amount of the rate.102. Even if the general basis of the scheme were to be regarded as satisfactory, a considerable practical difficulty would arise in its extension to England and Wales since Poor Law Authorities would bei required to draw a clearer distinction than at present between the able-bodied unemployed (and their dependants) and other classes relieved. This distinction is not readily established except by a close consideration of individual circumstances. Even in Scotland, where relief to the able-bodied was illegal until 1921 (though this prohibition was not always possible, strictly to observe in practice), discrimination in this respect raises difficult problems. Its introduction in England and Wales, concurrently with a scheme of Exchequer assistance applicable to able-bodied relief alone, might induce a tendency to regard as able-bodied unemployed certain cases which should more properly fall under other categories. The scheme would, of course, require the accounts of Poor Law Authorities in England and Wales to show expenditure on the able-bodied separately; this would, however, present no- great difficulty if the basis of separation could be readily defined and its observance seemed.103. Although the scheme, was put forward in two sections, one dealing only with current expenditure and the other taking into account the charges falling due; on loans raised to meet expenditure on relief to the able-bodied in earlier years, emphasis was laid by the witnesses on thei need for taking the latter basis if adequate assistance was to be given.104. To include in the expenditure for the calculation of grant the amounts applied in redemption of loans incurred in earlier years would, in our view, give rise to many inequities in the treatment of Authorities. As between two Authorities, one of which had borrowed to meet its obligations, and tho other of which had levied rates to the full extent necessary,
the former would receive grant in respect of past expenditure, although the necessity of the latter at the time the expenditure was incurred may have been just as great. In less degree, disparities would arise as between two Authorities, both of which had borrowed, according as the proportion of expenditure met by borrowing was large or small. Moreover, the periods of repayment of loans vary considerably, and in some cases repayment is actually deferred for a term of years. It thus becomes a matter of chance, depending upon the current burden of expenditure at the time loan instalments fall due, whether or not past expenditure will rank for assistance. With the question whether grant should be in any way retrospective we are not directly concerned, but we do not regard the method of giving such assistance, proposed in this scheme, as fair and equitable.105. After careful consideration of this scheme as a whole we are unable to recommend it as providing an adequate basis for the distribution of Exchequer assistance to necessitous areas. Generally it seems to- us that the scheme is one designed to transfer to the Exchequer on an arbitrary basis a considerable part of the obligations thrown upon Parish Councils by Parlia-ment in 1921, rather than to give special Exchequer assistance to necessitous areas.VI. OTHER PROPOSALS.106. It remains only to mention two schemes submitted by a conference of representatives of the Monmouthshire County Council and the Urban and Rural District Councils and Boards of Guardians in the administrative County. The first, submitted by the Urban District Councils, proposed that the charge on rates in respect of unemployment relief works should be limited to a rate not exceeding one penny in the pound, any excess being met by the Exchequer. This we regard as outside our terms of reference. The second, submitted by the Board of Guardians, proposed&apos; that the Guardians should be relieved of the burden of the relief of the unemployed by the provision from the Unemployment Insurance Fund of an allowance to the unemployed in lieu of relief of the amount of rent and rates actually paid by them over and above 3s. 6d. per week, and that expenses incurred in relieving unemployed persons in necessitous areas should be defrayed by Boards of Guardians up to a sum not exceeding a penny in the pound on the several parishes within the Union, any expenses in excess of that amount being regarded as a national charge to be met from the Exchequer.107. For reasons which will be obvious from the earlier sectionsof this report, we are unable to accept this suggestion as pro-viding any practicable basis for a scheme of Exchequer assistance.
VII. CONCLUSION.108. We have now completed the task entrusted to us. Throughout our inquiry we have endeavoured to divest our minds of any personal views we may hold on the merits of the case for special assistance to heavily burdened areas, the existence of which we recognise, and to confine ourselves strictly to the examination of schemes in their practical working aspects. We have to report that none of the schemes placed before us can be regarded as providing a fair and equitable basis of distribution of special assistance from the Exchequer. The terms of our reference have necessarily restricted us to/ an examination and report upon schemes submitted. Certain members of the Committee wish, however, to record their opinion that it is not impossible to adapt some of the principles embodied in those schemes, so as to give a basis of assistance to areas which are suffering severely from the heavy burdens due to post-war conditions. We would only add that if our detailed report inclines to stress the defects of the schemes to the exclusion of their merits, this arises from the scope of our inquiry. We acknowledge the ability with which the schemes have been presented, and, in particular, our indebtedness to the witnesses for their assistance and patience throughout our cross-examination.109. We desire to express our sincere appreciation of the services our Secretary, Mr. G. Ismay, has rendered the Com-mittee during the inquiry, and the ability and resource which he has shown in the preparation of this report.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants,W. H. N.
