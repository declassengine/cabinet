PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET. -     -iQJ^&apos;&quot;1       ^^^ItejigZ N^e about Established Strikers JC.P.    2^0      (26j)*J at DeptfordcThe cause of the participation of the employees of Deptford Victualling Yard in the General Strike has now been invest 1 gated oRepresentatives of the two Trade Unions concerned. The Transport and General Workers  TUnion and The Workers&apos; Union, have informed the Admiralty that there was no official order given from the Headquarters of either Union that the men at Deptford were to come cut *    In fact, it was contrary to the policy of both Unions that work at the Royal Victualling Yard should be interfered with.It seems, however-., that a minor official named Sargood, of the Yforkers&apos; Union, sent a telegram on Tuesday afternoon, the 4th May, that all the men of the Union were called out to He had no authority for this from Headquarterso    On Tuesday evening, as the men were leaving the Yard at the  closing time, a man met them at the gate and said:  &quot;All back to the Dining Room&quot;i    The men returned and when they were assembled an Established Storehouseman named Lubbock assumed the Chair and ordered all the men to go out,  stating that at all other Government Establishments the workers were out.    In reply to a question.^ he stated that at Chatham, Sheemess and all other Yards the whole of the men were outc      The man who had received Sargood&apos; s telegram then, said he had received an Intimation to the effect that all the men were called out.The Headquarters officials of the two Unions seem to have done nothing to enlighten the men as to the true position, though they succeeded in persuading the men at Woolwich Arsenal, who had also gone out without Headquarters instructions, to return last Wednesday morning, the I2th May;.These facts seem to put the conduct of the Established Men In a still worse light:  one of them took the lead in direct-ing the strike and none of them took any steps to assure them-selves that they were definitely ordered by their Unions to cease work and break the solemn undertaking which they had given on establishments    The statement made by the Established Store-houseman Lubbock, that the men in the other Yards were out, was of course entirely falsec(Intd 0        -13.
