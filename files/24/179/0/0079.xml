CABINET. )SECRET.P. 178(26). Government hands &amp; Buildings.Memorandum by the postmaster General.The Post Office assents in principle to the proposal to transfer to the Inland Revenue Valuation Department all the business involved in the sale and purchase of land and buildings for Government Departments generally.The practical   effect of such a transfer,  so far as the Post Office is  concerned, would be that the work of negotiating sales and purchases,  and in some cases of searching for sites and buildings,  at present performed by the Office of Works Directorate of Lands and Accommodation, would in future be performed by the Valuation Department. The Valuation Department is already consulted in every case; and in many cases,   in addition to furnishing Valuations of properties already under consideration,  the Valuers are able to give assistance in indicating alternative properties, which although not  &apos;on the market&apos;  are known or believed to be obtainable.The continued cooperation of the Office of Works Architects and of the Post Office Surveyor and Engineer in the search for sites and premises for Post Office purposes is essential.    This is a detail of organisation the satisfactory settlsment of which should present no difficulties.At first sight the introduction of a third Department into the relations between the buying Department and the property owner might seem to threaten a danger of delay On the other hand,  however,  the present method involves inevery(This Document is the property of Hia Britannic Jiaj esty&apos; s Government).
General post Office,  h.C.1. 29th April 1926.every provincial case of any importance the mission of an Officer from the Headquarters Staff of the Directorate of Lands and Accommodation, whereas the Inland Revenue Valuation Department already has responsible Valuers in all provincial centres,  in most cases Officers of v/ide local knowledge and in close touch with local property owners.  On balance therefore,  the proposed re-allocation of functions is more likely to save than to waste time.The case of hiring and letting is very different.    The Post Office has a vast number (over 5000) of short term hirings (21 years and under),  and has built up a very efficient and economical organisation for dealing with such hirings.    The transfer of such work,  which is spread over some hundreds of Officers scattered all over the country - the whole of the Surveying Staff,  with the minor cooperation of Postmasters -would effect no saving in Post Office Staff Costs,  and would involve ah unavoidable overlapping, and in numerous instances a disastrous delay.    The Post Office also holds a comparatively small number oifi hirings for longer terms,  extending in the case of a few buildings specially erected or adapted to Post Office specifications to as much as 42 years. The work in such cases is performed by the Post Office Surveyors with the advice and assistance of the Architectural Assistant to the Secretary, subject to financial scrutiny by the Secretary and the Comptroller and Accountant General. It is essential in the interests of efficiency and economy that this work should remain with the Post Office,  subject if necessary in the more important cases to the advice of the Valuation Department as to rental values.(Intld) WoM-To
