[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1 Printed for the Cabinet.   April 192.6.SECRET. Copy No.    31CP. 149 (26).CABINET.RUBBER RESTRICTION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE  or the consideration of my colleagues the accompanying memorandum containing proposals for the future regulation of the export of raw rubber from Ceylon and Malaya.L. S. A.Colonial Office, Downing Street, April 10, 1926.IT is necessary to decide and to announce on or before the 30th April what percentage of rubber shall be allowed to be exported from Ceylon and Malaya during the three months beginning on the 1st May next. It is also important, if possible, to announce at the same time by what principles the Governments concerned will be guided after the expiration of that period. I have received strong representations as to the undesirability of prolonging the present state of uncertainty, and I agree that it is essential that we should return as soon as possible to some system which will work automatically, and enable both producers and consumers to make their own calculations as to the future and shape their conduct accordingly.The views of the interests represented on my Advisory Committee do not coincide as to the percentage for the 1st May. Some&apos; favour 105, treating the additional 5 per cent, granted on the 1st February last as an instalment under the Stevenson scheme of a 10 per cent, release on the 1st May next. Others prefer not to increase the exportable percentage above 100. After&apos;having ascertained the views of the Colonial Governments concerned, I myself favour keeping the percentage at 100, where it has stood since the 1st February last. At this figure there is no restriction on the export of the produce of a normal estate which is prudently managed and does not recklessly overlap its trees. Under existing conditions restriction only operates to prevent the immediate export of accumulated stocks produced when the percentage was fixed at a lower figure. In the case of exceptionally favoured estates, which I believe are not numerous, there is, however, some restriction involved in that the assessment of the possible output of any estate of more than 25 acres is subject to a maximum of 500 lbs. per acre, even though the estate may be capable of producing more than this amount per acre. I propose that, as from the 1st May next, this maximum limit shall be removed, so that in future the assessed output of each estate will be its actual output under prudent management. At the same time any corre-sponding adjustment that might be necessary would be made for small estates of less than 25 acres.At the same time that I announce the exportable percentage for the 1st May next, I ought to indicate the general principles on which we shall proceed in future. The present position is unfair to all concerned. The Stevenson scheme was not only upset by the &quot; additional relief&quot; granted on the 1st February, but further there is a serious &quot;difference of opinion as to what it was intended should happen when the percentage of 100 was reached, and it could only be restored now if amended to meet the altered situation. What now confronts us is the danger of a slump in rubber [14414]
that would revive all the difficulties of the industry, and what we have to do is to provide some simple and efficient measure for checking any rapid or disastrous fall in price. It is desirable that our measures should be as simple as is compatible with efficiency, and, above all, that they should be automatic in working and preclude arbitrary interference in any direction.I have pointed out that there is at present no restriction on the export of the produce of normal estates and I have proposed the removal of the one remainino&apos; element of restriction in the case of the abnormal estates which can produce over 500 lbs. to the acre. Restriction would then exist in name only, except in so far as stocks may be concerned. I do not attach much importance to the question of stocks in future. By the 1st August next there will have been six months in which to work off stocks, while the estates have been prevented by labour difficulties from increasing their current output to 100 per cent. Also London stocks are under the normal figures. Although in actual fact the restriction scheme will in these circumstances be in abeyance, it would not, in my opinion, be expedient to announce its suspension; it is necessary to keep the machinery in working order as we shall have to resume restriction if the price falls below Is. 9d.It is obvious that to reimpose restriction at 100 per cent, in the event of a serious fall in price would not produce any appreciable effect. Something more drastic is required than the small cuts of 5 per cent, provided under the Stevenson scheme. I propose therefore that if for any quarter the average price of spot rubber on the London market falls below Is. 9d., restriction shall be reimposed and the percentage exportable at the minimum rate of duty during the ensuing quarter shall be 80. Supposing the average price for that quarter did not fall below Is. 9d., the restrictions would again be suspended until in any quarter the price fell below Is. 9d., in which case an export of 80 per cent, onlv would be allowed during the ensuing quarter.If. after the price had fallen to Is. 9d. and the percentage had in consequence been reduced to 80, the price continued to fall, the restriction would be made more severe on the following scale : Percentage for the ensuing; quarter.Price below Is. Qd., but not below Is. Qd.   ... ... 80Price below Is. Qd., but not below Is. 3d.   ... ... 70Price below Is. 3d. ....... ... ...     ,60If in any quarter the price remained at or above Is. 9d. and restriction was accordingly suspended for the ensuing quarter, and then during that quarter the price fell, not only below Is. 9d., but also below Is. Qd. or Is. 3d., the percentage allowed for the next quarter would not be 80 but 70 or 60 as the case might be. It would be desirable to make this plain in any announcement in order to check any market manoeuvres on the part of American users to produce a slump in rubber, but I do not think it necessary or desirable at present to go further in the direction of restriction than 60 per cent. Restriction below that figure would involve practical difficulties.I should like, if possible, to make a complete announcement of the above proposals at the same time as the percentage for the quarter is announced. I must, however, give the Governments concerned an opportunity of offering observations, and it may not be possible to set out the proposals in detail before the 1st May. If so, I propose to announce in general terms that proposals for dealing with the question of restriction in future are under consideration and will be made public as soon as possible, and that they will include measures to deal with any considerable fall in price. I should then follow this up by announcing the complete scheme as soon as I had considered any observations the local Governments might offer.The chief objection to the proposed scale is that it involves the adoption of a new pivotal price, and it will no doubt be criticised from that point of view, seeing that the avowed intention of the Stevenson scheme was to stabilise the price of rubber round about Is. 3d., which it was represented would be a remunerative price. I think, however, that the developments which have occurred since the adoption of the scheme justify us in selecting a new pivotal price. Users of rubber who have contracted for forward rubber at prices round about or over 2s. would not welcome a market price of Is. 3d. in the near future.
