HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY;OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. E C R E T. COPY NO:   J%JpTT 6&quot;7g6).-------C A B I N E ToRE-ORGAN ISA TION OF THE LEAGUE COUNCIL. Memorandum by Lord Cecil.I venture to p\it forward the following observations as a contribution to the formation of a policy in connection with the position of the Council of the League of Nations.There are two quite distinct problems in connection with the Council of the League of Nations.      The first is whether the permanent members of the Council shall be increased and,  if so, on what principle.      This ia mainly a problem of Spain and Brazil.      Both these Powers have been members of the Council since its foundation: both are Powers of considerable importance, though not in the first rank.      Each may claim a special position in the world.      Spain by reason of her his tory and the wide extension of the Spanish language:    Brazil because she has a vast extent of territory and is the only portuguese-gese speaking country in South America.      Spain may further claim that she has deserved well of the League both because she was the first of the neutral Powers to ask to join it,  and her adhesion at that moment was of considerable value in establishing the idea of the League, and secondly because she has been represented: from the outset by an individual of great diplomatic attainments which he has used in the interest not so much of his own country as of the League at large.      It is also true that Spain on many occasions,  and particularly on the Mosul question, .has shewn herself friendly to British
views on the Council,  though this is a consideration which should not have too much weight attached to it, On the other hand,  if Spain and Brazil were admitted it would be very difficult to draw the line against Poland, Yugo-Slavia,  Roumania and so through a des-cending scale of Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland etc. At present the category of Great Powers is clear and defined.      No one has ever doubted that the four exist-ing permanent members, together with Germany, Russia and the United States, are in a class by themselves, who may truly be said to have such world-wide interests that their presence on the Council for almost every question is clearly desirable.   - Unless therefore some equally defined principle can be discovered which would justify the admission of other Powers to be permanent members,  It Is to be hoped that no extension of the per-manent members will take place.The second problem concerns the non-permanent members At present there Is a tendency to re-elect the same six non-permanent members, not because it Is thought that they are pre-eminently qualified to sit on the Council, but because there is no principle or rule by which their successors should be chosen.      On the other hand there is the gravest discontent amongst the great bulk of the States which are not members of the Council on the ground that they have no share in what Is,  in many ways,  the most important part of the work of the League. This indignation has al?^ays existed, and it has steadily grown year by year.      Last September it was very marked, and sheired itself not only in a demand for a new form of election, but In a distrust of the Council and its
leadership, which might become serious.      The suggestion which has most usually been made to meet this demand is that there should be a rotation amongst the non-permanent members under which they should not hold office for more than three years, and two should go out every year,      I cannot think that this would be a satisfactory solution. There are some forty-eight members of the League, apart from the permanent members of the Council,,      Under the proposed regulation, and assuming that it applied to the whole forty-eight, each Power would only have an opportunity of serving on the Council once in twenty-four years, though its term of office would then last for three years. In other words, it would be most unlikely that any individual would ever serve on the Council more than once. That might be a quite adequate arrangement for some of the very small Powers:    indeed it might be excessive. There is no reason in the world why Luxembourg or Panama or Slam should ever sit upon the Council.      On the other hand it would be fantastic that Poland or Spain should sit there only every twenty-four years.     Nor would it be satisfactory that countries like Switzerland or Sweden should be so long absent from the Council table0     A proposal,  which has found a great&apos;deal of favour,  to mitigate this difficulty is that seats should be allotted to definite groups, but it is very doubtful if the groups are sufficiently well formed for such a purpose at present. The Little Entente is a group of the kind,  but It consists of only three States, and if it were enlarged by admitting Hungary or Greece or Bulgaria or Turkey or even Poland, It is doubtful if the members of such a group would really feel satisfied to be represented by one another.     Something might perhaps be done for this group idea by providing that the elected members of the Council should be chosen by proportional representation, but even that would go
very little way to meet the difficulties I have tried to describe.      The truth is that an attempt to provide representation on the basis of the equality of all States outside the Great Powers Is based on a disregard of realltieso      It is absurd to treat Spain and Luxembourg as equal,  or even Poland and Denmark^      There are, in fact, three categories of States outside the Great Powers, though the boundaries between the categories are not clearly defined.      There are the States like Spain and Poland which, without being Great Powers, are of great importance in the worlds      Then there are at the other end the tiny States like Luxembourg and Siam and several of the central American Republics, not to speak of Abyssinia, which have no claim in reason to a seat on the Council.     And then there are the large class of Intermediate States which ought to be on the Council from time to time, but need not be there very often or very long.     Unfortunately it would be quite impossible to draw up categories of these States,.      Indeed the attempt to do so would almost certainly destroy the League.      But it might perhaps be possible to allow the Assembly Itself at the time of election to make a distinction between those States which It thought ought to have prolonged representation on the Council, those which ought to be there for a briefer period, and those which should not be there at all0      I suggest therefore that the non-permanent members of the Council should he enlarged to nine,      Of this number,  three might be regarded as semi-permanent seats.      States occupying them would retain.their seats for three or five years, and be re-el&amp;gible at the end of their term of office.      The remaining six would be tenable for only one year, and would not be re-eligible for five years after that.      Candidates for the three semi-permanent seats might be recommended by a majority vote of the Council and accepted by a majority cote of the Assembly, on the same
lines as the Judges of the Hague Court.      The six non-permanent seats would be filled by proportional representa-tion.      No doubt this would tend to the formation of groups for the purposes of selecting the non-permanent members, but I do not know that that would be in all respects a bad thing It might be claimed that if all the Balkan States had to combine every year in order to settle who their representa-tive should be on the Council,  it might perhaps help them to combine for other purposes.    So, too, proportional representation would tend to give geographical areas proper representation, a matter which has often been pressed on the Assembly by China, and fee which the Assembly has in pj?lnoiple assented on more than one occasion,.      On the other hand it would probably be necessary to have a gentlemen&apos;s agreement limiting the number of representa-tives of particular districts.     For Instance it would have to be understood that no more than three of the nine elective seats should be occupied by South American States, It would be a question also whether the British Empire should seek an elective, as well as a permanent,  seat, at any rate for the present.If Spain were given a semi-permanent seat that ought to satisfy her.      It would no doubt mean that she would continue to sit on the Council so long as she had her present representative.,      Similarly, Poland would be enabled to have a seat on the Council,  so long as her relations with Germany rendered that desirable. The third seat would be available for a South American State if that was desired,  or possibly China - now, or in the future *Again, if the Assembly so wished,  it could prevent very small States sitting on the Council,  since a five year rotation would give plenty of candidates even ex-cluding such State si.Finally,  there may be a demand for giving the Assembly
a right to displace a State wlthh-an elective seat from the Council if it abuses Its po-;er there,  as Brazil has done. It seems to me that the words of the Covenant already give such power since the Assembly is authorised to select the non-permanent States &quot;from time to time at their discretion&quot;,. It might be well to ask the legal advisers of the Govern-ment what they think about this.      If it be so,  some regulation of this right of dismissal should be made by providing that it should only be exercised by,  say, a three-quarter vote of the Assembly, concurred In by a three-quarter vote of the CouncilsIt would be desirable to ascertain whether changes such as are here proposed could be made by regulation,  or whether they would require amendments to the Covenent,       I cannot see why they should require such amendments, but If they do it might be necessary to modify them to avoid this.Co2, Whitehall Gardens, 6th0 April,  1926.
