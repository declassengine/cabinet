Increased activity in the principal seasonal trades was maintained and again accounted for a substantial proportion of the total reduction in unemployment.

to which was made in the last Report, was maintained. The Cotton Industry-received a further set-back.The Table given above indicates that in most Industries the employment position towards the end of the month is considerably better than it was a year ago. In Shipbuilding, however, a slight increase in unemployment is evident, while the Cotton Trade is also in a rather more unsatisfactory position.(D.) Latest Figures.The latest figures of unemployment published are those for the 12th April, giving the total number on the registers as 1,024,400. There is an increase over the position at the 29th March amounting to 10,791, largely due to extended Easter stoppages.   Compared with a year ago there is a decrease of 180,370.A.
