Its position is extremely unfavourable.      Besides the general sales crisis at home, the subsidy granted by the British Government to the coal mining industry in England is, in particular,  affecting the Ruhr industry.      If, the Minister said,  the subsidy should be continued, beyond the 1st May, he could say already now on behalf of the Reich Minister of Finance that funds for the support of the German pit coal Industry would be forthcoming&quot;.This means that if we continue the subsidy, the Germans will have to do the same,  thus increasing their competition with our coal exports.W. S. c,Treasury Chambers. 6th April,   1926.
