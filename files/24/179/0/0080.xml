Memorandum by the Home  Secretary.This Bill is the Second Order for Friday, 7th May, and it is possible that it will be reached.Under the Bill, an officer appointed under seal by a mercantile corporation or company would become registered as an elector for premises occupied by the corporation or company and be entitled to vote at local elections^1 have received very strong representations in favour of the Bill from the City of London Corporation, the London Chamber of Commerce,  the London Municipal Society, and other bodies. It is pointed out that in many areas the greater portion of the rates is paid by companies who have no representation, and that there is no check upon the extravagance of the local authority. With the extension of the company system the position becomes more serious each year.On the other hand the Bill will be opposed on the general principle that the franchise ought only to be exercised by the individual citizen and not by or on behalf of a corporation. It will also be urged that it is illogical to give a company greater voting power than a private occupier of business premises who lives in the area.    He could vote once only, but the company would have one vote for their property, and each member of the company a vote for his own residence.Considerations of this kind were referred to by Mr. J.H. Thomas and others in a Debate on 5th May,  1922, on a proposal in a Private Member&apos;s Bill to give both the parliamentary and local government franchise to companies (see Official Report Vol.  153,This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.CABINET.SECRET. _LOCAL GOVERNMENT FRANCHISE CP. 179(26) . % i  ll(EXTENSION TO COMPANIES)  BILL,  1926. 3. m
W25-6columns 1734 and 1751) *    But I do net think that objections which oan be raised to the grant of the parliamentary franchise have the same force where the local franchise only is concerned.Personally I am in favour of the principle of the Bill, though considerable amendments would be required in Committee.I should propose, if my colleagues agree, to say that the Government are sympathetic to the principle of the Bill, but no promise oan be given that time will be found for its further progress.    In fact it is not likeljr that a division on the Bill will be taken,  since the First Order, which is the Sale of Food and Drugs Aot  (1875) Amendment Bill, will no doubt take some time and the time left for discussion of this Bill will probably be insufficient to justify the grant of the closure.There may also be a technical objection to the Bill on the ground that the title refers only to &quot;mercantile corporations and companies&quot; and that its provisions, which are not limited to mercantile corporations or companies,  go beyond its title.29th April, 1926.
