fTHIS DOCUME1MT is the PR OPERTY UF HIS BRITANNIC MaJESTY&apos;S GOVERhhfeNT J .SiHCRET. Copy No.CJ?. No. 152 (26).cabinet.Training of Townspeople for Land Work. femorandum by the iyjjiuster of agriculture.1.      I desire the authority of the Cabinet for the appointment of an Inter-departmental Committee to consider and advise as to schemes and methods of training which could advantageously be adopted in Great Britain with a view to fitting (a) adults and (b) juveniles from the urban areas for employment In agriculture either in this country or within the Empire overseas.2.     The appointment of such a Committee is supported by the Secretary of State for dominion Affairs, the ifinister of Labour and the Secretary for Scotland, but the Treasury see certain objections, and I submit the question therefore for the consideration of the Cabinet.3,     There are three main purposes which I have in view in proposing the appointment of this Committee,(a) To assist agriculture in this country by providing an additional source of labour by means of some system of rural apprenticeship for town boys,(b) To assist Empire Settlement by Increasing the number of prospective settlers of a kind acceptable to the Dominions, and(c) To provide fresh opportunities of work for some of the unemployed in industrial areas.4.     i believe that there are great political advantages in linking together these three purposes.   The farmers are intensely suspicious of the whole policy of Empire Settlement, ana they are particularly apprehensive of the probable result of the recent
Canadian Passage Agreement,  under which Canada requires four agriculturists out of every five settlers accepted.    If we can show the farmers that we are supplying part of the agricultural quota by training townspeople in lana work instead of denuding them of their skilled labour, and if at the same time we can add to their supply of labour by providing facilities whereby they can train town boys on their farms, it should do something to abate their criticism of the existing arrangement.5.     The training schemes which are being carried out at Claydon and Brandon by the Ministry of Labour and the Overseas Settlement Committee have proved that a short course not exceeding six months can turn town unemployed Into workers who will be accepted by the Dominions as agriculturists.    This experiment has completely converted the Dominion Immigration authorities who at one time were sceptical of the value of training in this country, and its extension would be a real contribution to the relief of unemployment among the younger men in many industrial areas.    It would also be of considerable political value in its bearings on the possibility of Increased unemployment in the coal industry.6. I have reason to believe that the appointment of the Committee would be warmly welcomed by the Labour Party as well as by our own supporters in the House of Commons.7.     I propose that Lord Bledisloe should act as Chairman of the Committee, which would Include representatives of the Ministry of Labour, the Overseas Settlement department, the Scottish Office, the Farmers&apos;  Unions and the Trades Union Council as well as some Members of Parliament.S.      I hope therefore that the  Cabinet will approve of the appoint-iant of the Committee on the lines suggested.W.0.nistry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 13th April, 1926.
