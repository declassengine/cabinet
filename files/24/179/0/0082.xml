8ofroITHIS DOCUMENT 15 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC ^JBSTV&apos;3 ^OVBRWMSNT.CA B II K T.SECRET &quot;Revised Programme of Legislation CP.182(26). (Ministry of Health).Copy No . A fMemorandum by the Minister of Health.On the   22nd of December, 1925, I submitted a programme of Ministry of Health legislation for the present session of Parliament (CP 536(25)).On the 9th of February last I submitted a Memorandum (CP 50(26)) dealing at greater length with one of the bills mentioned in the earlier Memorandum (the &quot;Guardians Supersession BILL&quot;) and In this connection I may also refer to the Memorandum of the Home Secretary of the 17th of February, (CP 76(26)) dealing with the question of dlsenfranchisement for Guardians1 elections of persons who have received poor relief.The first of the Memoranda above-mentioned enumerated four bills which I placed in the category of necessary bills, and referred also to a slum improvement and rural housing bill, and to a public health amendment bill prior to consolidation. Later developments have rendered it possible to postpone the bill on railway rating, and the public health amendment bill cannot now be ready this session.     As regards sltim improvement and rural housing, the consideration of the latter question Is sufficiently advanced for the preparation of draft clauses. Slum improvement is presenting difficulties and it Is at present uncertain whether they can be surmounted In time for legislation this year.The Guardians Supersession Bill (for which specificauthority was given in Cabinet Minute-4(26) of the 10th ofFebruary) included as one of its most important elements aproposal to disfranchise for Guardians&apos; elections on the around- 1 -
of receipt of poor relief.     I find that there is among our own supporters in Parliament bo strong a body of opinion opposed to this step on political grounds that I have come to the con-clualon, and the Home Secretary authorises me to say that he concurs in my view, that it would be unwise to proceed any further, weighty as the arguments for It seem to me to be on the merits. ., If this provision is not included in the bill, I think it Is probably not worth while proceeding with the rest of it.     I hope next year to introduce and pass the bill for poor law reform and I should, in the interim, avoid any overt dispute with Boards of Guardians calculated to lead to such difficulties as arose last year in West Ham.I desire, however, to substitute two other measures for those proposed to be given up this year -(1) a short bill to amend the Mental Deficiency Acts which would be introduced In the House of Lords.     During this year there have been sad cases in the courts, much public disoussion and many references in Parliament to the serious mental and moral after-affects of the disease called encephalitis lethargica.     These cases should be dealt with in institutions under the Mental Deficiency Acts but cannot be so dealt with as the law stands,     I proposed to make the required amendment and a few other amendments found to be necessary in administration - none of them at all controversial;(2) a bill to consolidate the poor law, which would go to the Joint Committee In the ordinary course and take practically no parliamentary time.     The principle of the poor law reform scheme Is to transfer the functions of the Guardians as they stand to the local authorities.     The statutes on the subject are numbered by scores and consolidation* ***      2       mi^western^-i-s;-^ ......______.1 .\ -........ &apos;
before the actual transfer has bean promised.     Consolidation before the poor law reform scheme is Introduced will be of the utmost Importance in saving: parliamentary time on that scheme, as the National Health Insurance Consolidation Act was last year in connection with the Widows1 and Orphans&apos; Contributory Pensions Act, but to an even greater extent by reason of the much greater   complexity of the legislation.One bill introduced by a private member at the request of the Whips f Office has now passed the Committee stage In the House of Conmons viz:- the Births and Deaths Registration Bill.     It la a very useful measure, prepared in my Department, and I should be very glad If Government facilities can now be given to it.(INTLD.)     N.C.Ministry of Health,30tb April, 1926.
