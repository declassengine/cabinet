(THIS POOy^IT IS TIISj PROPERTY OF. HIS britannic MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERgjgEMT) .fcBCIlET -i   x^Tp;i33/26. Copy Ho. .Jj UGABIKBTcUNIVERSITY OP LONDON,IffiblORAlKDmi. Toy, the PRESIDENT of the BOARD of education on the 23rd January last I circulated a Memorandum on University of London reform.     The Departmental Committee has now reported and its Report has been published^     I have consulted the Treasury, who are of opinion that legislation on the lines of the Report should be introduoed at once and I will submit a draft Bill to the Home Affairs Committee as soon as possible.While I cannot, of course, ask the Cabinet to comtnit themselves to the details of proposed legislation at the present moment, it is, I think, important that there should be some early declaration of the Governments general intention in order to forestall the growth of e-n agitation against the Committee&apos;s proposals.     Opposition will probably come only from a small minority and if a Government decision could be announced, this minority would probably not be able to make much headway, but if the attitude of the Government is left vague they may be more successful,I suggest, therefore, that I should be authorised to say that the Government are in general agreement with the Committee&apos;s recommendations and pro3?ose to introduce legislation to set up a Statutory Commission on the lines of the Oxford and Cambridge Commissions.     The Oxford and Cambridge Commissionswere aet up to &quot;make statutes and regulations..................&quot;in general accordance with the recommendations contained in the &quot;Report of the Royal Commission but with such raodif icationa....&quot;..........., as may, after the consideration of any representations&quot;made to them, appear to them expedient&quot;.     An announcement of this kind would, therefore, not commit the Government to an1.-ta^man&apos;] )................______ _-__,.1,,.^,!
acceptance of all the Committee^ recommendations as they stand.     If legislation is promptly introduced, it will not so much matter whether it is passed this Session,I append a summary of the Committee^ main reoommendationso25th March, 1926,
SmMAM. Of MAIN RBGtMfflHDATIQWS,.To establish a new Body - tho Council of the University-consisting of 16 members, a bare majority being members of the Senate, which shall control the finance of the University, and in particular shall have final authority in the allocation of University funds.The Senate to consist of 48 members in place of 56, so selected as to secure a hotter representation of the constituent Institutions of the University.    The Senate to control the educational work of the University, subject to the financial decisions of the Council.To establish a further new Body - the Collegiate Council - consisting of the members of the Senate representing the large Colleges and the two members of the Senate representing the Medical Schools, together with such other representatives of Schools of the University as the Senate may determine.This Council, will have the same general relation to the Senate on matters affecting Schools and Colleges of the University as the Academic Council (representing the Teachers) now has on questions of curriculum affecting Internal Students or the Council for External Students has on matters affecting such students.To remove the organisation and supervision of Secondary School Examinations from the purview of the Board which deals with University Extension and Tutorial Classes and to place them, together with the arrangements of the Matriculation Examination, under one Board - the Matricula-tion and Schools Examination Board.To lay down revised conditions governing the admission or re-admission of an Institution as a School of the University.
i5j .(6)        To secure greater weight to the position of Principal of the University.P 0 T g.The most important recommendations are those referred to in (1) and (3) above and if the Council of the University is established as recommended, the University Grants Committee will, no doubt, be prepared to entrust to it the allocation of the grants (flaunting for 1925-26 to over  400,000), which are now allocated by the Committee direct to 22 different Institutions.
