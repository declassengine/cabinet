(Secretary). &quot; &apos;The Chairman : I observe that Mr. Thomas&apos; Richards is not here this afternoon, and I happen to know that he is laid up, to the great regret, I think, of all of us, and I think-we might, perhaps, send him a resolution of sympathy, with our best wishes&apos; for his early recovery.   (Hear, hear.)(Agreed.)We are glad to see that Mr. McKenna is sufficiently recovered to be here this afternon with us. &apos;Well, Mr. Smith, we have had from you two documents Mr. Cook&apos;s letter of April 9th and the statement which you sent us about half an hour ago. Perhaps you would like to make some remarks upon the documents by way of explanation or amplification. &apos;   : - ;Mr. Herbert Smith : I was wondering whether we should, take our reply page by page; because we have tried to make it as clear as we possibly could, and if you want to ask any questions we shall be prepared to try and answer them.   We have tried in our humble way to answer theMINERS&apos; FEDERATION OF GREAT BRITAINMINUTES OF PROCEEDINGSOf a Meeting between  the Central Committee of the Mining Association of Great Britain and the Executive Committee of the Miners&apos;Federation, held at General Buildings,  &apos;. Aldwych, W.C., on Tuesday, April 13, 1926
points which you people submitted, and have answered them as we interpret they ought to be answered as far as we are concerned.The Chairman : We have the two documents which you have seat to us and we have gone through both of them. I think you will agree that they must both be taken together. We have got a position- to deal with which does not depend entirely upon the recommendations of the Commission in any respectsi. There are recommendations for the futm-e of the industry which we have interpreted in one way and which you have interpreted in another way. To a greater or less degree there: is1 unanimity on some points and there is difference of opinion upon others. I think we would feel that many of these cannot have any effect upon the position of the industry for ai considerable time, and that the details in regard to them are not the immediate questions which call for consideration by us here.We have got a very definite and stern position which we have to face at the end of this month, and our view is that we should not take up very much - time in discussing shades of meaning or differences in regard to the interpretation of those things which really remain to be dealt with in the future when we get the industry going, but that we should concentrate, rather, upon those points which are essential to the determination of the vital question of what is going to happen to the industry when the Govern-in en t&apos;s assistance by way of subvention of wages comes to an end.Mr. Herbert Smith: I do not know that we very much object to that, except that we have to remember that when we met you last time you put before us certain proposals; we then suggested to you we should wait while we put our proposals, and then discuss them together. You people said: &quot; No, we shall give ours to the world &quot; ; and, as a matter of fact, I think i am. right in saying you had arranged to give them and they were all in transit under a certain command that they were to appear at a certain time. You do not suppose we are as simple as we look. We intend this going out to the world like yours went out.The Chairman : We have not the slightest objection.Mr. Herbert Smith : I do not want to be charged with any underhand business. We intend this to go out. We say to you that if you have any questions to ask we shall be glad to answer them. It has to appear in the Press; we have not given it to the newspapers yet; we have waited while we delivered the goods to you first.Mr. Lee : So did we.The Chairman : I think you are under a misapprehension, Mr. Smith, if you think that anything went out from this office before we submitted the proposals to you. If you remember, we had to keep you waiting some time while our document was being typed and roneoed to distribute to you, and it was not till some time after the meeting and after you had been informed that it was our intention to send our replies upon these points to the Government and sending them to the Govern-ment meant sending them to the public it was only after that, and late in the afternoon, that we sent the communication to the Government and to the Press. I think you are right when you say that we asked the Press not to publish them until the Saturday morning, so that there might be no suggestion that they were being hurried into the Preses before you your-selves had had full time to consider them.Mr. Herbert Smith: I do not know that I shall quarrel with you, except to say that if it had not been Good Friday it would have appeared
son Good Friday morning; the next day being Good Friday, they appeared on Saturday, because no newspapers came out on Good Friday.The Chairman : I think you are entirely wrong there. We did not want them to appear until you had had them in your possession and taken them back and given to them such consideration as you wanted to give.I might, perhaps, mention that you on your side did print the verbatim notes of the last two meetings that we had and issued them to the Press and to your members before we had any opportunity at all of correcting the transcript of the notes. Whilst we must all agree that our shorthand-writer is most expert and careful, and that the mistakes he makes are surprisingly few, it does happen that a word may have been missed by him, not through his own fault very likely, but through lack of clearness on the part of myself, perhaps, more than you; and we should have liked to have had an opportunity of correcting those transcripts before you issued them to the Press and to your own members.Mr. Herbert Smith : I do not think that you intend deliberately to mis-quote, but I want to say seriously that nothing was issued to the Press and has not been issued to the Press as fa,r as we are concerned. Issued to our own members, yes; because we had a conference called together, and it is quite true that I do not know about anyone else, but I spent Easter Sunday at it to get it revised and to send back a, little correction ere and there very few-The Chairman : We did not have the opportunity; I am not suggesting that it mattered what the Press got, but your own people did get a print of the proceedings which had noft been corrected and verified by us. I have not seen it yet; I have only seen a few extracts in the Press, and I do not know to what extent there may be mistakes in them; but I want to point out that it is very desirable when a document of. that kind is issued by cither side that the other side should have an opportunity of reading it through and making such corrections as may be necessary.Mr. Herbert Smith : I do not know that I shall quarrel with you at all on that. I think that each side ought to have equal opportunity. But there ought to be a limit. If a thing is necessary to be done it should be done as expeditiously as possible. I want to put it to you seriously that we had 150 or more delegates here, and tho more concrete we could put our case as happening between you and us the better they would be enabled to judge of the position.The Chairman : I am in entire agreement that it is very necessary that those whom we represent here should know all that transpires; but it is equally necessary that they should not get any version which may be incorrect in the slightest degree.Now, Mr. Smith, I do not know that we have any questions, to ask you on a great many of these points to which you have replied. There are points upon which we disagree with you in the interpretation at which you have arrived, and I think those differences are such as would not be reconciled in any way at all if we spent a good deal of time in discussing them here to-day.Mr. Herbert Smth : There are one or two corrections I would like to make in our replies. The first is on page 7 in the reply to No. 11, which should read, &quot; Such co-operative selling agencies will be established,&apos;&quot; instead of &quot; should be established.&quot;Then on page 9, the reply to No. 17, line 5: &quot;In respect of Pit Com. mittees &quot; should be &quot; In respect to Pit Committees.&quot;
The Chairman : As I was saying, the replies on a number of these questions from your side differ in interpretation from the interpretation which we put upon them; but, as I have said, we do not think that we should bo wise in spending- time in trying to reconcile what may be irreconcilable on points of that kind as applying to those questions which, to our mind, are not fundamental to deal with at the present moment.-.- We have, as we all know, a very serious situation confronting us. &quot;we have had the industry carried on by State aid for the last eight and a-half months, and the Government have intimated that that aid is coming to an end on April 30th, and. that, with such qualifications as the Prime Minister made at his meeting with us the other day, the industry has got to find its own footing and to carry an upon its own basis from that time onward. The serious situation with which the industry is faced must be as well jknown to you as- it is to us. It is a situation which in some districts is one which presents an aspect which is far from being what any of us would like. ,The economic position of the industry in the export districts in particular is a deplorable one. There are other districts which are not so badly hit. But it is perfectly obvious that a reconsideration of the whole position in regard to costs of production in the industry is the subject which calls for our immediate and our very serious consideration.We have no agreement of any kind in existence at the present moment, We recognise with you that if the industry is to bo carried on there must be agreements between the two sides determining the conditions upon which the industry is to be carried on as between you and us. It is essential that the industry should be placed in a position of knowing where it Stands; that each district should know what its own position is going to be in the future, and no amount of discussion upon what can be done by way of reorganising the production or on the commercial side can have any material effect at all upon the situation at the 1st of May.We put to you at our last meeting and&apos; in the communication which we handed to you at the end of the last meeting our view as to the practical way in which the situation should be dealt with at the present moment. We have said that we are prepared to discuss and arrange with you a National Agreement. We are prepared to do that, and to determine the principles upon which the ascertainments of wages should be made in the different districts, and that all that is necessary to enable those ascertain-ments to be made should be determined on a national basis as between you and us on lines similar to those which have been in operation in the past, with the one qualification which we have put to you and which is, I think you must agree, inevitable, that a national minimum is no longer possible. There ace such differences of conditions in the various, districts as would necessitate the dealing with those conditions &apos;in the districts themselves within the principles that may be laid down by us for general application. It is&quot; only those who know the conditions in the districts, those who are in the districts themselves, who can properly deal with the situation in those districts, and we have put to you quite definitely our view that these questions should at once be referred to the districts for their consideration, so that they may examine together on both sides the situation in the particular districts and try to arrive at some agreements in regard to them which will - enable those districts to be carried on. We think we should concentrate upon that practical means, which we should adopt at once with-out delay, to deal with the whole situation oil those lines.We see that both in your letter of April 9th, which gives the decisions of your conference, and also in different parts of the statement which you
put to us to-day, you express views which are in complete divergence from ours as to the-position. These are the questions which we think ought to be dealt with, and&apos;dealt with straightaway. I do not. think there can be any denying on your part that unless the costs of production are,: brought down it will not be possible to carry.on the industry except upon a very meagre and a very scanty scale.I do not want to dwell upon the effects which such a result would have upon the economic position of the country asi a whole; but it is quite clear that until we can get in each district such terms and conditions of employ-ment as are within the economic capacity of the industry, not only the livelihood of those who are engaged in the industry will be menaced but even the life of the nation itself; and we do most strongly appeal to you that we should set aside all that is not essential and fundamental at the moment, that we should recognise that the position has to be met and has to be met to a varying degree district by district varying according to the ;iosition in those districts and we feel very strongly that the only course which we can on both, sides take at the present moment which is likely to lead to a solution of this difficulty is for us here to agree that in the districts there should be meetings held without delay to consider the positions in the districts and to determine such matters as can only be dealt with in the districts, and that such of them as are necessary to refer to the national body afterwards should, after the districts have dealt with them, be brought up here for such discussion upon them as may be necessary.That, I think, Mr. Smith, is the view that we take on the position; and we feel that the seriousness of the situation is so acute that we should be doing injustice to ourselves, and we should be failing in our duty to those whom we represent on both sides, if we do not set aside all other considera-tions at the moment and sit down to tackle the fundamental problems which face us. Whatever happens we and you have got to come to an agreement at some time or other, and I should think it must be obvious that we lose not only time but lose very valuable substance indeed if we allow these discussions to be delayed, and if we allow anything to intervene which would be certain to affect the ability of the industry and the ability of the country to maintain the position of both owners, and workmen in this industry.Me. Herbert Smith : Are not we back exactly where we left you on April 1st? Because we want to suggest to you people that these questions that we have put here in reply to yours are fundamental. The Commission realised that they were fundamental. If we turn to page 229 of the Eeport we see there: &quot; It is necessary, finally, to emphasise the fact that, in our view, revision of the minimum percentage should depend upon acceptance by all parties of such measures of reorganisation as will secure to the industry a new lease of prosperity leading to higher wages.&quot; Then it goes on: &quot; Before any sacrifices are asked from those engaged in the industry it shall be definitely agreed between them that all practicable means for improving its organisation and increasing its efficiency should be adopted as speedily as the circumstances in each case allow. The measures to these ends which we consider practicable are stated in the preceding chapters of this Report, and will be-summarised in the chapter that follows.&quot;I want to put it to you and to your colleagues that those two paragraphs are most fundamental as far as negotiations go generally. Now you tell us at- this date that State aid looks like ceasing at April 30th. You people have asked for it to cease. It is no&apos;new thing; you have asked far it to cease.. - And when we ventured to offer any opinion so as to get to know
from the Government what were their further intentions you people did not help at all. The consequence is that if you people now regret what you have done you ought to make your confession at once and say so; because we realise this equally as much as you do, that if the industry has got to go it has got to go with everyone pulling his weight.We have been told by this Commission that nationalisation is not recommended. The consequence is that we have to find other factors. You say (that the economic position of the industry is serious; we have been saying that for some considerable time and trying to impress it upon you. You say that the export districts are worse than other districts. I agree that with the outlook it seems like that.Then you say there is no agreement in existence at the present time. Why? Because you people refused to enter into an agreement. We had to enter into one with the Government because you people refused to do it; consequently that agreement is in existence, signed by the Government and us, as long as its operation is continued.Then you tell us what you told us not only at the last meeting, but what you have been telling us since 1925, that each district knows its own position and that other people do not know it. I want to put it to you people that this Executive Committee, with the information that it gets and its rubbing shoulder to shoulder with the people in the various coal-fields like you do in investing your money in various coalfields is capable of discussing with you a National Agreement, and it proved that in 1921 and in 1924 by doing it.If what you say amounts to this, that you are not prepared to discuss with us or to tell us anything because we tried to press you at the last meeting to know what was really in your minds as to the suggested minima you intended adopting if you say to us to-day: &quot; All we can say is, go back to your individual districts; do that, and you can come back to us and see whether we approve of it,&quot; that, I submit to you, is trying to stop ?nd to frustrate the intention of the Commission. Because the Commission is very definite on this thing. If we look at page 149 -I need not argue it over again, because it was dealt with fully at the last meeting; that may be one of the fundamental principles on which you say we agree.Mr. Frank Hall: It is page 152.Mr. Cook : It starts at page 149.Mr. Herbert Smith : On page 149 of the Beport you will see this: &quot; Because the Forest of Dean cannot guarantee a standard of living abso-lutely up to the minimum thought necessary in Yorkshire, it does not follow that mining in the Forest of Dean should cease to exist. It is, however, essential, as we point out below, to secure, either by national negotiation or national approval of district negotiations, that the various district minima do not diverge too widely, and that there is no possibility of that cut-throat competition at the expense of wages which the Miners&apos; Federation fear.&apos;&apos; I put it to you people that that is put in there intention-ally, that we should discuss general principles, and we should discuss the minimum wage which it to be operated, from our point of view, nationally. You say it is impossible. If that is the position you take up and you say, &quot; It is impossible to do anything in this direction unless you people accept &quot; that is what it means &quot; the construction we put on this Beport, we are not prepared &quot; that is what you are saying all the time-&quot; to discuss with you nationally the various minima from a national aspect, all I have to say to you is this, that Mr. Cook forwarded to you as early as
it was possible to do so resolutions considered by the districts brought to a national conference as to what our position is. Not only did that con7 ference agree to these resolutions to recommend them to the districts, but this Executive approved of them and believed they were right in doing it, and we say so yet. If we are anxious (as you say you are) to get settled, I suggest to you as kindly as I possibly can that you ought to tell us now what is really in your minds as to what minima you intend applying to the various districts. This is the first thing we ought to get here. Because we have made up our minds that the present position we are in and that the wages our people are earning I know there are figures in that book; they are ex parte figures as far as I am concerned -are not the wages they ought to earn; they ought to have more money than they are getting to-day; and to ask them to submit to a lower standard of living is simply asking that production be reduced, because the men would not be in as efficient a position to produce as they would be even with the wages as at present, which are too low. If we want to get this industry going the first thing we have to do is to appreciate the man who is producing material; and if the country wants it, then it is up to the country to see that the man who does produce it gets a wage he can live on respectably to produce it. That is the first consideration.The next consideration is this, as long as we have private enterprise, that the people who invest their money in the industry are due to some consideration for the money they invest in it. I do not mean those people who spend their time at Monte Carlo and get profits out of the industry but do nothing in return for them; I am speaking of the people who render some service to the industry.I want to suggest to you and to your people kindly that we ought, if we feel it is as serious as we say we do, on each side to sit down now and say : This is the minimum we suggest that is, from your point of view district by district. Our reply at the present time is that it must be a national minimumi regulated nationally, and with the present standard of wages there is no room for reduction, because people could not carry on with a less wage than they have at the present time.The Chairman : Well, Mr. Smith, I think that really brings us up to a consideration of what I alluded to, after all, as being the fundamentals of the situation. The Commission suggests a good many things that we ought to do in regard to the matter, and we have accepted that position and expressed our willingness to do what we can what it is possible to do, what it is practicable to do in these directions. The Commission made certain suggestions in regard to things which affect ,you directly, and iti seems to us that in the resolutions of your Conference, which you submitted to us last week, in effect you say that you are not prepared to do any of them. You say : That no assent be given to any proposal for increasing the length of the working day. You do not refer there in that paragraph to any variation by way of redistribution of the present working hours over five or over six days at all, and in, your statement to-day you say, &quot; The miners do not think that the suggestion of redistributing the present total weekly hours over a week of five days is practical owing to the irregular time worked in . the industry.&quot;The question of the length of the working day-the distribution of the hours is one which, of course, requires legislation,: and it is perfectly clear, I think, up to the present at any rate, that it would be only upon an agree-ment between you and us that Parliament would intervene upon a question
of that kind.. So that we can leave that matter out of our immediate con-sideration.   If the, attitude you indicate- is in effect that you are not pre-pared to consider either the increasing of the length of the working day-_.Mr. Cook : Hear, hear.The Chairman :-- or of the working week, or of any redistribution of the hours, with the object of giving greater flexibility for workino more hours on one day or less on another, or in any way that mi(Tht be agreed between us if that is your,view, that you say you are not prepared to consider any variation of any kind, in the present position in regard to working hours, then I do. not think it would be wise for us to take up anv time in discussing that matter. i take it from what you indicate now that that is the position you take up ?Mr. Cook : That is so.The Chairman: Mr. Cook says: &quot; That is so.&quot; Then you proceed to say: &quot;That the principles of a National Wage Agreement with a national minimum percentage be firmly adhered to.&quot; That brings us up against the main question, after, all, and makes the position one whiieh has got to be faced and upon which there can- be no equivocation or ambiguity in any-thing we say to each other about it.Mr. Prank Varley : Hear, hear.The Chairman : Your view of the matter, as we interpret that sentence, is that you adhere firmly to the establishment of a National Agreement which will prescribe one uniform national minimum applicable to every district in the country. I do not think those words are capable of any other interpretation than. that.Well, I think we have indicated to you pretty clearly that in our view that is an absolutely impossible situation for the industry to continue to work under. The Commission in its Eeport is as definite upon the point that there must be variations between the minimum rates in. the different districts as it is upon any point in the whole of its recommendations. We have no hesitation at all in saying that in our view there is no possibility of a uniform national minimum in the industry; that the minimum for each district must be decided upon the position in the district itself, subject to approval by the National Board when, the districts have arrived at (call them what you like) settlements, agreements, or proposals, to submit to the national body.Mr. Cook : The national body cannot vary.The Chairman : We have not said so. I just want to make our position perfectly clear to you. This body is not competent to deal with the variety of the circumstances which exist in the different districts; they can only be dealt with by the people who live in those circumstances in those districts.Mr. Frank Varley : Is it not just as well that we should make it plain? - You said just now we ought to have no ambiguity.   You said to Mr. Cool; a few moments ago you had not said that they would have no power to vary or veto; but you did say so the other day, did youi not, in terms? Mr. Cook : Hear, hear-.The Chairman: No, I did not. . What i-said-was. this- -- Mr.&apos; Erank Varley :. Birt listen,    What form, or what nature-&quot;(,7, The Chairman&apos;: What is that document?Mr. 1&apos;rank Varley : The minutes of our last meeting.
The Chairman : We have not got that.Mr. Frank Varley :, Will you take, it that I, am reading from it ? .The Chairman : I will accept the correctness of your reading it.Mr. Frank Varley : It is at page 37 of the printed minutes, and what you said was this: &quot; What form., or what nature, the approval of the National Board who do it afterwards may take to our mind is not a question of very great importance, because I think you will agree with us that when in a particular district the two sides have agreed upon a minimum percentage to be, applicable for that district,, it is inconceivable that the National Board would proceed to investigate, for the purpose of varying, or vetoing, that decision.&quot;   You say that it is inconceivable.The Chairman : Is this the first day ?Mr. Frank Varley : I think it is. the second day.Mr. Lee : The first of the two days in that week ?Mr. Frank Varley : Yes.Mr. Lee : You were told definitely on the second day that the wording of that had been altered, and there was a discussion on the third day which altered that.Mr. Herbert Smith : It was the 31st March.Mr. Cook : But your correction only was if you look it up to the extent that we should refer those questions to the National Board. I asked you the question: Can they veto what has been decided? And you said &quot; No,&quot; and I asked, &quot; What is the use? &quot;Mr. Lee: Will you read the discussion? It was perfectly plain, and I have it well in my mind. Mr. Varley put some questions to Mr. Evan Williams.Mr. Frank Varley : If you say you have departed from thalij position we shall have to accept that.The Chairman : I said this: &quot; We said yesterday that we would agree to a reference to ensure that national principles had not been infringed. We qualified our acceptance of reference to ithe National Board yesterday, and we now make the reference to the National Board for approval unqualified.&quot;   You will find that at page 88 of the Notes.Mr. Cook: Yes, I know; but prior to that, on page 85, you make it quite clear as to the power of the Central Committee.The Chairman : I do not think there is anything on page 85 which deals with that particular question. Those were the last words I used upon, that matter.Mr. Herbert Smith : If you read lower down you will see Mr. Varley says: &apos;&apos; Buft you say that the quantum forms no part of the national principle,&apos;&apos; and you say: &apos;&apos; We say the quantum forms no part of the national principle.&quot;The Chairman : I say that still. But that does not affect thei power of the National Board to deal in any way tbait it likes with any agreements or proposals that may come up from the districts to it for approval.Mr. Lee : The national principles were the things to be settled by the. National Board in the first place; we say i^he quantum of the minimum is no part of that; it should be dealt with in the districts and then referred to the National Board.The Chairman : Quantum is not a principle.
Mr. Frank Varley: No; and because iftis outside the purview of the functions of this Board the Board deals with general principles, and the quantum is not a principle, therefore we cannot deal with it firstly or secondly.Mr. Cook : Do you now say that the Board can veir^y tho minimum--can change it or veto a decision arrived aft by the districts?The Chairman : We make the reference for approval to the National Board unqualified. The National Board can take any action it likes if it agrees on any matter of that kind which, is referred to it by the districts.Mr. Cook : It cannot be referred unless the two parties agree.The Chairman : You have to get something concrete from the districik before the National Board can deal with it.Mr. Cook : Therefore the districts themselves must decide the minimum that is Sjo be paid?The Chairman : The district must formulate a proposal to be submitted to the National Board for approval.   That is what it comes to.Mr. Prank Varley:  What do you mean by &quot; approval &quot;?    Does&quot; approval &quot; include disapproval, alteration, variation,  veto., rejection_what ?The Chairman : It means either approval or disapproval surely, does it not?Mr. Frank Varley: But you could not leave it there, could you? We want to know your intention; that is all. Supposing it came up here and we disapproved ; what is the procedure then?The Chairman : Then if the whole of the National Board disapproved of a proposal which had come up to it from a district it could refer it back to the district for reconsideration,.   That is the only thing it could do.Mr. Frank Varley : We had a bit of that with our good friend Lord Ashdown in Scotland, did we not?The Chairman : That is really all I can slay. But it brings us back to this, after all, that in our view, without any question at all about) it, the discussions and the formulation of proposals with regard to district minima, must be dealt with in the districts themselves. They are the people who know the circumstances, and this body as a whole is not competent to deal with the questions of minima for 13 or more districts (as the cas&apos;e may be) throughout the country. They must be dealt with in the districts them-selves.In regard to the question Mr. Smith put again to-day as to whether we were in a position to tell you what the owners! were proposing as minima in the districts, I say, no we are not in a position; we do not know what any district) is prepared to do, and the view of us all is that we should meet together, if you will meet us, in each district; we will discuss the whole situation in the districts with you and try to arrive at and evolve out of those discussions proposals&apos; to submit to the National Board. We hope we are not going to be again in the position that we have been in on, at any rate, one previous occasion when you have asked for proposals from the owners and they have submitted them to you and then you have asked for their withdrawal before . any discussion could take place. We want pro-posals from the districts in regard to minima to evolve out of discussions between the two sides in the districts; and we hope that you will agree at once to meet us in the districts in order that the situations in the districts
may be considered and discussed and that proposals may be arrived at for submission to the National Board.Mr. Herbert Smith : I do not want you, Mr. Chairman, to misunder-stand us at all. We do not accept your statement that you do not know the facts of each district.   You are playing for safety. &quot;The Chairman : Mr. Smith-Mr. Herbert Smith : Allow me; I have listened very patiently to you. You are playing for safety entirely, because you know what is in your own districts at the present time. I want to put it to you ii you know what is in the minds of all districts you ought to be able to give us an estimate, if you are so anxious to negotiate as to what are going to be the minima which are going to be put before those districts. If not, we have figures to guide us; those are the figures you put last year which have been approved by the Mines Department as figures with which you supplied them, and we have to rest on them. If you have something different from; that in your minds you ought to tell us here at once and let us know what it is; because we can read in this Commission^ Report that probably the reduction may be less than 10 per cent, in some districts, and it may be more in others. That is very indefinite. You people know the definition as far as you are concerned, and you ought to be open and square with us and tell us what you have in your minds.If I take your own words on the third day, you say in reply to me, &quot; No. I am not suggesting in the very least that our attitude towards the subsidy will be changed at all. We have the declaration of the Prime Minister that if a settlement is arrived at there will be certain districts where the reductions in wages will be heavy, and that the Government will con-sider coming to the assistance of those districts in some form or other. We shall raise no objection to that at all.&quot; I suggest to you that the districts that you have got in your minds as districts know what their attitude is at the present time as to what suggested minima you are prepared to offer in those districts. When you suggest meetings on certain things and certain eventualities you also have certain evidence that you are prepared to sub-mit there. I want you to be open with us here to-day and tell us. what really these reductions amount to in these various districts that you suggest.The Chairman : I want to be perfectly open and frank with you and to tell you all that we know with regard to that. Not only do we not know here what any district considers it can offer as a minimum, but I think I am right in saying that there is no district that yet knows what it can offer, and it is waiting to see whether you will meet in the districts to consider with them what they can offer before they formulate any proposals of any kind at all. That is the actual position to-day. I say that you are not entitled to make any assumptions from figures that have been published, either official or otherwise, as to what may be the wages that the districts may be able to offer when you can, by meeting in the districts and dis-cussing the matter with the owners, get at some exact information as a result of the discussion.Mr. Herbert Smith:. Are not you playing with words?The Chairman : No, I am not playing with words at all. I am telling you definitely and categorically that not only do we not know, but the dis-triets themselves do not know. ; - -.Mr. Cook : What is the use of meeting, then ?
The Chairman : They are not going to make up their minds as to what I they can offer until they have given you full1 opportunity of meeting ana^ I; discussing in the  districts with  them   and trying to arrive at some conclusion. . ,Mr. Herbert Smith: So that the proposition&apos;you are laying down, Mr. Chairman, is this: &quot; Before we are going to tell you people anything you have got to break up your national aspect.&quot; We are not going to do it; let that be perfectly clearly understood from this side. If you people have any-thing in your minds, as to the variation of minima, tell us here and let us see what it is; let our people know, and let our people have an opportunity of voting and saying whether they will accept it or not.The Chairman : I have told you definitely, and I should be only repeat-ing myself if I went over it again, that the position is that we do not know, nor do. the districts themselves know yet, what proposals they can make to you in those districts, but you can find out by meeting in the districts and discussing and exploring the whole situation, and they will meet you with open minds.Mr. Prank Varley : Are we to infer from that supposing we were to discuss the general principles for the governance of the districts now, you cannot tell us what is the general principle which will apply in the district to govern the quantum in that particular district?The Chairman : It is perfectly clear that the general principle that is laid down is that wages are to be determined in accordance with the ability of the industry, subject to a minimum percentage.Mr. Prank Varley : If that is the formula-The Chairman : That is the only formula, which has always existed. The difference now is that the minimum percentage must very from district to district, must be decided in the light of all the circumstances that can be taken into consideration between the two sides in those districts, and cannot be laid down as a flat minimum rate for the country as a whole. It would be idle for me to lead you to think and if there were any question of that at all I do not think there should be from what we have said before, that the 1924 minimum, or anything approaching it: is not entirely out of the question as a minimum. The Commission^ Report itself has spoken very definitely in regard to the 1924 minimum, that there must be reductions in wages, and substantial reductions in wages, too, in many districts as an absolute fact if the industry in those districts is going to be carried on at all.Mr. Cook: What do you mean by &quot; substantial reductions &quot;? You say &quot; There must be reductions in wages and substantial reductions in wages.&quot;.&apos; The Chairman: It seems to me that is a question which is somewhat absurd, when I tell you that I do not know, nor do the districts know, what they will offer.Mr. Cook : You seem to know there will be substantial reductions That seems an absurdity, too.The Chairman : The Commission says it is inevitable that there, must be reductions in wages in districts.Mr. Prank Varley : You do not know how much, but you use the word &quot;  substantial &quot; just to encourage us to go there!The Chairman: You will have to go there.some day.
Mr. Herbert Smith : I think you ought to withdraw that once; because if you talk like that we shall say something else. If you say:.. &quot; We will make you people dp what we like,&quot; we have got past that, and you ought to withdraw it.The Chairman : I am not prepared to withdraw at all. I am making a prophecy, if you like, that to consider the situation in the industry as a whole and not in detail as far as the districts are concerned is unthinkable, and the Beport of the Commission is definite on that.Mr. Herbert Smith: You say, &quot; You have to do so-and-so.&quot; I say you will not make us that is the other side to it.The Chairman: I say that some day or other.we shall have to meet in the districts. District questions will have to be dealt with in the districts, there is not the.slightest doubt about that.Mr. W. P. Richardson : I suggest to you that as a National Board you are in a better position now to know the full position of the districts than ever the districts were in a position to know before there was a National Board. I suggest to you that there has been collected under the National Board methods of ascertaining costs of wages and labour costs and various other things that have put you as a National Board in possession of data which was never put in the hands of a District Committee when the districts operated. So that in comparison with the districts you are a better informed people, and we are to a degree than we ever were before. I put it to you that even under the operation of the National Agreement with the subsidy that you know now to the minutest penny what is happening in the districts. You do not suggest if we go back to the districts and discuss the individual collieries we should not have to discuss the very data you have before you now. Therefore Mr. Smith was correct in saying you are trying to evade this question particularly with a view of getting us away from the National Board. The facts are against you. The data is supplied by the Joint Chartered Accountants, and the fact that so much is being said about the coal trade shows that you have the evidence, but you will not tell us what will operate. I think you will have to give something much more substantial as a reason to convince anyone that you are not in a position to deal with this question nationally.The Chairman : I am very sorry, but it seems impossible to convince you. Perhaps you are not anxious to be convinced. But that just exempli-satisfactory the absolute necessity of going back to districts and not dealing with these questions on the. bare figures, which we should have to do if we dealt with them here, but when all the considerations and all the risks that may have to be allowed on both sides will have to be taken into consideration.Mr. Feank Varley : But Mr. Evan Williams could be just as candid in London as in Cardiff if he so required.The Chairman : I should be prepared. to discuss the South Wales posi-tion in Cardiff, but I should not be prepared to discuss it in London, and I am not prepared to discuss from this chair the conditions in Scotland or Northumberland or Durham, or anywhere else.Mr. Herbert Smith : I do not know that that kind of expression will help us at this meeting at all, because we shall get to know later. When you people start to take the necessary steps to break service of contract, we shall know under what conditions we can continue working. You people will not try to tell me you do not know what are likely to be the reductions in the districts. I know you do know, and I know some people who are amongst you who have expressed it, too.
The Chairman : If you say frankly you do not believe me, I am hot going to trouble to make any more assertions of that kind; I simply say once more we do not know here nor do the districts themselv.es know. They are waiting for you to see whether you will meet them in the districts to discuss the matter.Mr. Cook : You are emphatic that you will not discuss wages nationally.The Chairman : We are quite emphatic upon this, that the question of the minimum for each district must be dealt with in the district, and when in the districts they have arrived at proposals which they can submit to the National Board, then is the time for the National Board to give its con-sideration, and not before. It is quite idle to talk of our wanting to break the national aspect. We should not be prepared to set up a National Board if we wanted to break the national aspect of this matter. We admit at once it is against our views as previously expressed to the Commission. We accept the position to examine as laid down, and are prepared to negotiate a National Agreement on principles, but that these are questions which are purely district questions and we put the minimum rate quite as much as we do the subsistence wage in that category of questions which are purely district questions and as regards the minimum rate we are prepared to accept the recommendation of the Commission that it should be brought up to the National Board for approval when the district is in a position do so.We have got to consider in dealing with this question also the position that you have taken up in regard to this mallter. You have said quite definitely, it seems to me, that wages are already too low, and you cannot assent to any proposal for reducing wages. Quite frankly, the proposals that we should have io make in the districts to you will certainly be to a very large extent proposals for reducing wages.Mr. Davies : How do you know ?The Chairman : The position is so obvious. It was obvious even to the Commission where they say that the wages will have to be reduced in every district.Mr. Davies : Why I put the question is because you plead such profound ignorance of the position.The Chairman : The Commission, which had all these figures before it, refrained from making any suggestion as to the minimum rates; they say the minimum rates must vary; they must be settled in the districts, but that there must be reductions is inevitable.Mr. W. P. Richardson : Is it the fact that you are not examining the data that is at your disposal so that you might be in a position to say that you do not know ?The Chairman : No, it is not.Mr. W. P. Richardson : Is it a fact that before the Commission you submitted a bundle of evidence touching every district in this country that is represented in the mining industry from the standpoint of wages, from the standpoint of output, from the standpoint of costs, in fact from every conceivable standpoint? Did you put a single man in from the districts to back up that evidence ? Is it not the fact that you put them in from a national standpoint; you kept them absolutely within your own sphere, and you did not even go to the trouble of putting an outside person in the witness box to contribute &apos;&quot;to the case that you had. You now say the Commission say there must be reductions.     You tried to convince the
general public and the Commission that the trade was in a bad way and there ought to be some sacrifice, yet you come and tell us that before these things can be put before us what you think the revelations justify and what you asked for it is difficult to believe that the same body which went along those lines cannot tell us what in their opinion are the reductions the men must suffer.The Chairman : The figures we submitted to the Commission were figures which had been ascertained by joint accountants; they were in a concrete form in our possession and we submitted them as they were. The suggestion that you now make that we confront you suddenly with a decision that minimum rates must be settled in the districts will not stand examina-tion, you know. It has been our view for a very long time. We have made no disguise at all in the position we took up of the strength of the view that we hold that these questions must be dealt with in the districts and that this body is not competent to deal with them.Mr. Herbert Smith : We do not agree with that. We are entirely at variance on that. We are satisfied we can deal with them if we have the opportunity to deal with them. While you have argued that side we have argued the contrary; and the evidence has been given, as Mr. Richardson has said, which has made us more qualified to do it than ever. If you knew when you were before the Commission, telling them what rates would be, you know equally well to-day from what has been ascertained by the same joint accountants as were working on this business at that time. The evidence is, as I put it to you again, that it is simply an attempt to get us away from this national body to discuss agreements, and that we do not intend going to at this time.The Chairman : It is a remarkable thing that though the figures, as Mr. Eichardson has said, were presented in one lot for the country as a whole, the Commission definitely came to the conclusion that the minimum rates would have to vary district by district and would have to be discussed and arranged as far as possible in the district themselves.Mr. W. P. Richardson : No.The Chairman : We are at variance evidently. We say definitely that we are not prepared to discuss the minimum rates for any district here in London. We are open to discuss them with you immediately in the districts, and to explore the whole position and try and arrive at some figure which may be acceptable to both sides.Mr. Frank Varley : If you say will not, we must accept that; but up to now you have been saying this body is not competent, which implies cannot. Mr. Richardson says this Board can. You have the data; you have what you call the concrete data,; you have it up to date. If you have agreed on the general principle it means the application of that general principle to such data as you have in your possession, and you can tell us what is likely to happen in the big districts in the kingdom.The Chairman : Do you say the bare figures are the only things to be taken into consideration ?Mr. Frank Varley: I do not know what your general principle is.The Chairman : Each district will have to decide for itself what risk it will have to run, what sacrifice it is prepared to make. Those are things which can be dealt&quot; with in the district only. Our view is quite definite upon this point. We are not prepared to discuss here with you, as a joint body of our Central Committee and your Executive, the minimum rates for the different districts.   We say they have to be dealt with in the
districts, and we are prepared to deal with them in the districts at. once. We have to recognise at once that that cuts-right across the decision of your conference.Mr. Cook : And it cuts right across the statement made by the Corn-mission on page 152 of the Report, and it is on page 4 of our replies, in the reply to No. 6 : &quot; We do not see how such a wage in a community so small and so closely united as Great Britain can ultimately be fixed by other than national authorities.&quot;. .&apos; Mr. Lee : Why not read the end of the paragraph ?Mr. Cook: You can go to the end; but the beginning lays it down that the National Board can discuss that wage. Mr. Varley has put it very emphatically, there is no denying the fact that it can. It has. It did in 1921; and I think you endorsed the statement of the Prime Minister that it started a new era in the mining industry. It was an agreement welcomed by your side, the principle of fixing a national minimum. It operated until 1924 and after 1924. Now you say it is impossible to operate. The fact of the matter is, as Mr. Varley has said, you do not desire it to operate.The Chairman : I think it is clear that the Commission came to the conclusion that the 1924 agreement was disastrous in its operation; and whatever they may have said in different parts of the Beport, in their final Beport they say: &quot; It appears to us a reasonable course for the national conference to refer the question of minimum percentage and such other matters as they think appropriate to district associations to frame pro-posals.&quot; We say we accept that, and evidently you say you do you accept it, because you are not prepared to do it.Mr. Cook : You do not accept the question there is no sacrifice to take place until reorganisation. Those things possibly are not important. The only important thing to you is a reduction in wages.The Chairman : You are not entitled to say that at all.Mr. Cook: You say those are the questions of moment; those are the questions you are concerned with on the 1st of May.The Chairman : They certainly are the questions we are concerned with on the 1st of May. But whatever reorganisation comes about on the pro-ductive side or on the commercial side will not have any effect on the 1st of May, and whatever it may amount to it will not make reductions of wages unnecessary that is perfectly clear.It is quite clear that we are at variance upon this question of the district settlements, of district discussions in the first place, or for the formulation of proposals on the minimum wage. It seems to me we seem to be equally at variance on the other questions. You say you are not prepared to accept any reductions of wages at all; that there must be cne national minimum; and that minimum must be practically the same as it is at the present time. There, again, we are at variance on fundamental points, and I do not see how that is going to be got over. The Commission^ Report says definitely that reductions in wages must be made if the industry is not going to meet with disaster. It says quite as definitely that these reductions that have to be made will have to be dealt with in the districts themselves.Mr. Herbert Smith: We are quite willing to discuss with you the national minimum here and now this week if it is wanted, because we ere anxious to get to know what really is the position.
I have a paper before me here which tells me certain things. It tells me that Scotland without the subvention would have 2s. 7d. a shift reduc-tioh; that Northumberland without the subvention would have 3s. 2d. a shift reduction; that Durham without the subvention would have 3s. 8d. a shift reduction; that the Eastern Area would have 7d. reduction; that; South Wales would have 3s. 5d. reduction; that Lancashire and Cheshire and North Staffordshire would have Is. 6d. a day reduction; that South Staffordshire and Salop would have Is. 9d. a day reduction; that Cumber-land would have 3s. 6d. a day reduction; that the Forest of Dean would have Is. 8d. a day reduction, and that the reduction per day in North Wales would be 2s. 7d. If there is anything like that in store for us, as far as we are concerned we are not prepared to accept it. We want to get to know from you people what is really in your minds, where you intend taking us to, in regard to the reduction in wages if those figures are not correct.The Chairman : I have, told you as plainly as I can what is in our minds, and I say that you are not entitled to make any assumptions at all such as you make. Where you have got the means of getting the information from the people who are prepared to discuss it with you, you should go and get the information there, and I say it is not right that you should publish assumptions which you make without any authority of any kind at all. &apos; &quot;You see, it brings us back to this point. You speak of these reduc-tions based upon these figures as being very heavy; on the. other hand, you say that you recommend to the districts that they should decide that in effect no reductions at all shall be made. We want to know definitely where you stand in regard to that matter. I think that is a question which each district would want to know.Mr. Herbert Smith : I think we have told you as clearly as language can tell you where we stand.1 Tlie Chairman : Are we to assume then, Mr. Smith-Mr. Herbert Smith : If these figures are wrong it is you people who ought to give us the correct figures. The responsibility is with you people if these figures are wrong.The Chairman : No. You are misinterpreting what I am saying. Those figures are not wrong, but you are wrong to base on those figures assumptions which you are not entitled to make, because you have not been in discussion with the people who can tell you, after discussion with you, what they would be prepared to do with regard to the minimum wages. 1 think the position must be cleared up. We have put our position quite clearly. We say that reductions in wages are inevitable. The amounts of those reductions can be ascertained only by discussion between the two parties in the districts themselves; and we suggest, in the interests of everyone concerned, that you should proceed at once to deal with these questions in the districts, because, as I have said, we are not competent and are not going to deal with them here. I do not want you to have any doubt at all about our attitude on that point.Mr. W. P. Richardson : I think you should put the latter first.The Chairman : Take them in any order you like.Mr. Herbert Smith : I do not think that we need take up any further time. If you have said the last word we had better take it. It want.to say to you people here that you have not attempted to forecast to us any pro-position on reorganisation or anything else that is part of this business, but you ask us to take a leap in the dark, and we are not prepared to do it.
We have been dealing with you long enough to know how far you will go until you are; compelled. If that is your last word we. cannot go any further, because we are not going back to the districts to discuss this thing until we get further information as to where we are.The Chairman : I do not think we can leave out of account your very definite statement here that the principles of a National Wage agreement with a national minimum percentage be firmly adhered to. That is in direct opposition to the Report of the Commission. Do not put it upon us that we are arrived at a deadlock; the deadlock is being arrived at because you in that sentence are refusing to accept the recommendation of the Com-mission in regard to the point. The next sentence is &quot; Inasmuch as wages are already too low, we cannot assent to any proposals for reducing wages.&quot; There, again, you are in direct opposition to the Eeport of the Commission and in absolute contradiction to the necessities of the case.Mr. W. P. Richardson : Do not you agree that they are too low? You have said before that the miners&apos; wages are too low.The Chairman : If the industry could afford it we should be only too glad to give you higher wages than you are getting. The higher the wages the better it is for all concerned.Mr. Herbert Smith: You say, &quot; We are not going to do it,&quot; and I end it there.   I am compelled to take your words.The Chairman : Eates of wages do not determine earnings. You may have high rates of wages and very poor earnings, whereas with lower rates you might get higher earnings.Mr. Gilliland : On page 151 of the Eeport of the Commission, speak-ing of district percentages, you will see this: &quot; But the delimitation of districts must obviously itself be a matter of national agreement, and it is hard to see why the principles on which the economic ability of each dis-trict is to be determined from time to time should not be uniform, or at least prescribed by national authorities.&quot;The Chairman : We are prepared to do that, applying the principles on which the ascertainments of the ability are to be made.Then, Mr.Smith, I take it that the position we have arrived at is this: That you say that there must be a national minimum uniform for all dis-tricts; that there must be no reduction in wages ; and that there must be no increase in hours and no variation of hours. Whereas we on our side say that we are prepared to discuss with you what can be done in the way of variation of hours, or if ait any time you feel mclined to modify your attitude with regard to an increase of hours we shall discuss that with you. We say that we are prepared to discuss with you the principles of a National Agree-ment, and such machinery as is necessary to be determined nationally to carry out district arrangements; but that the rates of wages, both as to minimum and subsistence wage, must be dealt with in the districts, and when dealt with they are to be subject to approval by the National Board afterwards. That seems to me to sum up the position we have arrived at to-day.Mr. Herbert Smith : We are met here and we are still prepared to discuss with you the national wage question as we define it, and we are prepared to spend all this week if necessary to try and arrive at a settlement. We have been there all the time, we are still there. If you people have any desire to settle wages now we ought to sit down now and stant to discuss that national minimum.
The Chairman : It does not seem to me to be quite consistent with ihe recommendation of your Conference to the districts that there should be no reduction in wages and thai there must be a uniform national minimum.Sir Adam Nimmo : Will not Mr. Smith say frankly that that is not a fundamental condition with him that there must be no reduction in wages ? He is always asking for assurances on our side ; we think we are entitled to a definite answer on the point whether he is standing on this, that in no circumstances must there be a reduction in wages. Can we have a reply to that.Mr. Herbert Smith : Sir Adam Nimmo is a fine prompter, but I am not prepared to answer this as he wants it answered. I am prepared to discuss a National Wage Agreement here and now as far as the Federation is concerned.The Chairman : We have had no denial from you of the position as put in these three resolutions. You have recommended your districts to say that there shall be no reduction in wages; there must be a uniform national minimum; and the only conclusion one can come to is that you stand on a national minimum of the amount which was included in the 1924 agreement, and which the Government have maintained for you during the past nine months.Mr. Cook : On the other hand, you are not prepared to inform us what reductions you desire. You have only told us that reductions must take place in every district.The Chairman : Each district will be prepared to discuss with you, and it need not mean very long discussions ; two days in each district might clear the air, and put you in possession of the whole of the facts and of all the risks and sacrifices the owners will be prepared to make to meet the position to the best of their ability.Mr. W. P. Richardson : Do I understand you to say that the Govern-nient help has been given for us ? Do you infer by that that what has been given has been of no advantage to the owners 1The Chairman : All I said was that the wage had been maintained at the level the 1924 agreement put it at by the subsidy the Government granted.Mr. W. P. Richardson : Some of the owners have got substantial profits upon that; therefore, is it fair to say that the wages have got it all ?The Chairman : I think you will find when the whole period is taken into consideration that the owners have had profits which are very far indeed from being in relation to the wages that the men have had ?Mr. W. P. Richardson : What do you say the profits have been ?The Chatrman : I do not know. I am not prepared to discuss that phase of the question at the present moment.Mr. W. P. Richardson : You have had the figures supplied to you to inform you.The Chairman : Yon have equal access as I have.Mr. W. P. Richardson : It must not go out unchallenged that the money the Government has provided has found its way to tne miners&apos; pockets, and that no substantial amount has gone into other quarters.Mr. Cook : The quarterly statement proves that.The Chairman : I do not think that is pertinent to the issue we are discussing at the moment.
Mr. Herbert Smith : I think we understand the position clearly now, that you people are not prepared to discuss with us a National Wage Agreement.The Chairman : You are wrong there. We are prepared to discuss with you a national wage agreement, but we are not prepared to discuss with you either a national minimum for the country as a whole or the various minima for the different districts until those come up to the National Board after discussion in the districts themselves.Mr. Herbert Smith : Very ingeniously put.The Chairman : I am adopting the words of the Keport- Mr. Herbert Smith : Allow me; I sat very patient while you were talking. Just let me say, very ingeniously put. You say to us : &quot; Go to the districts and fix the minima, and then come back and we will fix up a national agreement.&quot;   If that is not the wrong road home I do not know what is.Mr. McKenna : It is putting the cart before the horse.The Chairman : You are reversing the order. I said we were prepared to discuss a national agreement with you forthwith, in so far as the national principles are concerned that are necessary to enable the industry to be carried on, but the district minima shall beconsidered in the districts.Mr. Frank Varley : If that is so, why did you seize upon what you call the fundamentals and invite this deadlock ? Why did not you tell us your general principles ? Have you got them now ? Will you tell them to us now ? -The Chairman : I think you are approaching this question in an entirely different way from what has been always the case in the industry. You are asking us to dictate to you, in effect, what shall be done, instead of sitting down together and considering.Mr. Frank Vabley : If we are reverting to the pre-subvention period, we have received from you a notice to end the Agreement of 1924, and we are entitled to say to you : What are you going to substitute for it ?Mr. Cook : Hear hear.   You are seeking the change and not us.The Chairman: I do not regard it as our.substituting. We would be bound to substitute something for what we arrived at in 1924. In 1924 did make proposals to you which you said you would not discuss and withdrew them ; we sat down together and arrived at an agreement after discussion. JMr. Cook : We put proposals before you. When, we gave you notice in 1924 we put proposals before you, all of which we did not get. You gave us notice last year. Presumably you will give us notice again to end at the end of April contractural notice. Assuming this, it is you now who desire a change, just as we desired a change in 1924. What facts do you desire ? Mr. Varley has asked you what are the general principles what reductions ? You have been emphatic in declaring that there must be substantial reductions in every district..     ..The&apos; Chairman : I said the Commission has, definitely, said that the minimum percentages in each district must be substantially reduced, and we accept that. , . .        -   - ...Mr. Cook : You accept that they must?    ... -The Chairman: Yes. . .--......- &apos;&apos;
Mr. Cook : And you are prepared to carry out that part of the Com-uiission&apos;s report with regard to having substantial reductions in wages ?The Chaisman : We agree with the Commission that they are essential. But when you talk about the changes, what we suggest to you is that we should sit down together and see what these changes should be.Mr. Frank Varley : This is where we were at 3 o&apos;cIock. Why have we gone away from there ?The Chairman : Because you are not prepared to sit down with us to discuss a National Agreement, as I understand it, which does not contain a national mhiimum.Mr. Frank Varley : We want some general principles even before we get to a national minimum, do not we ?The Chairman : It is no good playing with this, Mr. Varlcy. We are up against a position--Mr. Frank Varley : That is what I say, but you are throwing the onus on to us. I agree it is no use playing with it, and I want to say that you intended this meeting should be a deadlock because our Conference had passed a certain resolution.The Chairman : No. You must remember this, that this meeting was called to receive your reply to the position we put to you.Mr. Frank Varley : Which we gave to you; and as soon as we gave it to you, you said it is only trimmings, the fundamentals are so-and-so.The Chairman : The fundamentals at the 1st of May are those points on which you gave us the views of your Conference contained in your letter of the 9th of April.Mr. Herbert Smith : It seems we cannot get any further. We shall be glad to hear what proposals you have to make as to the district minima.The Chairman: We said definitely: &quot;So far as the recommendations of the Commission which call for action by the owners are concerned, the following statement of their attitude in regard to the various recommendations will show that whatever may be their views on a number of expressions of opinion in the Beport, they have approached the matter with open minds and that it is their sincere desire to do their utmost to give effect to the objects aimed at in the recommendations if a settlement by agreement can thereby be effected.&quot;   That is our position.Mr. Cook : With your interpretations ?The Chairman : Not at all. There can be no question about interpreta-tion on the fundamental points -varying district minima and reductions of wages.Mr. Herbert Smith : Our reply to that statement would be: &quot; In con-el conclusion, the miners desire to emphasise the statement of the Commission that the settlement, not merely of the principles on which wages are to be deter-mined, but of minimum percentage, is a matter for national authorities on the ground that, in the words of the Commission, &apos; to give a free hand to each district to settle its own standard of living is to expose the standard of the more efficient and prosperous areas .... to undermining by the weaker areas, and open the door to cut-throat competition between different districts at the expense of wages.1 In the miners&apos; opinion, therefore, the two sides should as early as possible formulate a national agreement by means of which such a minimum percentage may be determined.&quot;
The Chairman : There is no such minimum percentage applicable nation-ally in any part of the Report. I think, Mr. Smith, the position is really much too serious to trifle with, or to stand upon any ambiguity or equivocation of any kind. We think that the only way to save the industry is for us to get down to a consideration of the questions in each district that call for attention, and to deal with those questions upon such principles as may be agreed on nationally. It is perfectly obvious that a national minimum percentage is entirely out of the question, and that the minimum percentages must be dealt with district by district, and must vary district by district, because the conditions in the districts vary to such an extent ; and, as I have said before, the maintenance of the present wages is a matter of absolute impossibility except upon an output of coal which will be insignificant, and upon which the country is bound to rush to doom there is no other choice before it.Mr. Herbert Smith : We do not want telling that. We are not dealing with this matter lightly or we should not have been here to-day. We have come to-day with the intention of doing business from a national aspect, and are prepared and willing to do it, and will be all the time. So that we are not trifling with this business. Any man who foolishly goes into a crisis like we are heading to on both sides would not be fit for his position as a responsible official in the movement. We have tried to face this position honestly and fairly, and we say to you people : Sit down here with us and tell us what you say the national conditions are and what your national minimum will be in your estimation in each district; then we will reply.The Chairman : You see, the fundamentals, after all, are the questions of the wages that are to be paid in each district. Those are the questions that have to be dealt with as from the 1st of May; and if you maintain your position that there must be a national minimum settled nationally it is only playing with the thing to sit down and pretend to discuss anything of a national character if that is a condition which is to be attached to it.Mr. Prank Varley : Our statement is. that inasmuch as you have just said the fundamentals are wages, and previously you said you contemplate substantial reductions of wages, all that emerges from this Report in your view is a reduction of wages.Mr. Cook : On the 1st of May.The Chairman : On the 1st of May. We stand by what we said with regard to the recommendations of the Commission on the production and on the commercial sides absolutely.Mr. Herbert Smith : What you have said is non-committal. If we had gone through these replies point by point we should have shown that you were playing with it.The Chairman : I do not think you are entitled to say that, because we have a very sincere desire to do everything that is possible and practicable to make the industry as successful as it can be made.Mi&apos;. Herbert Smith : Can we get to know from you people what is your next step 1   Will you issue notices ?The Chairman : That we have not definitely decided. In some districts  yes, certainly.Mr. Herbert Smith : We are on varying notices. Some districts are a fortnight, some are a week, some are day to day.The Chairman : These notices are not notices to terminate contracts as such. The position that we are in now is that we pay a certain amount of the wage and the Government pay the remainder of the wage ; the Government
say, &quot;We are not going to pay our part of it after the 30th April.&quot; Then we have to say at once that there will be no obligation upon us after the 30th of April to pay the wage that is now being paid with the Governments assistance.Mr. W. P. Richardson : You are coming down to the 2s. 7d. and the 3s. 9d. a day reduction which Mr. Smith has mentioned.The Chairman : No ; those figures have no foundation.Mr. Herbert Smith : I do not profess to be a lawyer, because I should then be charged with blacklegging ; but all I say to you is that when you give over paying wages that is the finish of the contracts. As soon as you put mo into a different position from that in which I am now, that is the ending of my contract.The Chairman : I think it really rests upon the workman to say whether he will continue or whether he will not.Mr. Herbert Smith : No, it does not. When he knows he will have a less wage that will be the finish of it.The Chairman : I have not the slightest doubt that unless some other arrangement is arrived at that may be the position.Mr. Herbert Smith : Well, if you re-consider your position at all and let us know we shall be glad to meet you at any time.The Chairman : We can say the same to you. If you are prepared to re-consider your position we are waiting to meet you within the districts to deal with the urgent questions there. The time is passing, and we ought to get at them. Or, we will meet, you in London to discuss the national principles which can be embodied in a National Agreement, bat not to discuss ,i national minimum.
