[This Document is the Property of Flis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]SECRET. Copy No.  3!CP. 138 (28).CABINET.EAST AFRICAN AND PALESTINE LOANS.(Circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.)IT will be recalled that at the meeting held on the 24th February (Cabinet 7 (26), Conclusion 6) the Cabinet discussed the question of the proposed guarantee by His Majesty&apos;s Government of a loan for Palestine, and decided that the question of making the guarantee conditional on spending all the money raised either in the United Kingdom or the territory itself should be considered.Some difficulty was apprehended that the attachment of such a condition might be represented as inconsistent with the terms of the Mandate.As the same difficulty appeared likely to arise in the case of the proposed East African Loan, of which a substantial proportion is to be allocated to Tanganyika Territory, I thought it best to refer both cases to the Law Officers of the Crown.I now circulate for my colleagues&apos;- information copies of the cases submitted to the Law Officers, and of their opinions.It is satisfactory that in neither instance the terms of the Mandate are, in their opinion, likely to be prejudiced by the condition which it is wished to impose.L. S. A.Colonial Office, March 25, 1926.I.The Law Officers of the Crown.Gentlemen, . Downing Street, March 5, 1926.I am directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to state that it is proposed that the Government of Palestine should raise a loan in London at an early date for the sum of  4,000,000, and that a question on which he would be glad to be favoured with your advice has arisen in connection with the terms on which this loan should be floated.2. On account of the peculiar position which Palestine occupies as a Mandated territory, it is proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Treasury should guarantee the payment of the principal and interest of this loan. A copy is enclosed of the Draft Bill which it is proposed to present to Parliament for this purposed3. In anticipation of the Loan the Palestine Government has spent over  2,000,000 on works of a Capital nature. It is proposed to charge the whole or at any rate the greater part of this expenditure, to the funds raised by the loan. It will also be necessary to provide out of the proceeds of the loan for the expense of raising the loan, and the sum of  500,000 is to be paid to His Majesty&apos;s Treasury as the first half of a payment due to His Majesty&apos;s Government in respect of the fixed Capital Assets transferred to the Palestine Government in 1920. The balance of the proceeds of the loan will be spent on works of development in Palestine, and it will probably be more economical, in certain cases, to have the works carried out by contractors under the supervision of Consulting Engineers.4. In this connection the question has arisen whether it would be consistent with the terms of the Mandate for Palestine that there should be attached to the British guarantee of the proposed loan a formal condition that any contracts for works of development to be paid for out of the loan should be given to British and not to foreign firms.* Draft Palestine Loan Bill (not printed).[14359]
/II.The Law Officers of the Crown.Gentlemen, Downing Street, March 5, 1926.WITH reference to the letter from this Department of even date concerning the Palestine Loan I am directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to state that a similar question has arisen with regard to a proposed Loan for East Africa,2. It has been decided that a Bill shall be drafted and introduced to guarantee Loans for railway extensions and other communications and for scientific research in East Africa up to the sum of  10,000,000. A considerable portion of this Loan will be spent by the Government of the Tanganyika Territory.3. The exact allocation of the money will not be settled until the Committee which has been set up to advise on the subject has reported.4. It is expected that about half of the expenditure will be in this country, chiefly on railway material, and the question has arisen whether it would be con-sistent with the terms of the Mandate for the Tanganyika Territory that there should be attached to the British guarantee of the proposed Loan a formal condition that all non-local expenditure shall be in the United Kingdom.5. A copy is enclosed of the Mandate for the Tanganyika Territory.t The question appears to be governed by the interpretation to be placed on Article 7 of the Mandate which provides (inter alia) that &quot; The Mandatory shall ensure to all nationals of States members of the League of Nations, on the same footing as to his own nationals, freedom of transit and navigation, and complete economic, commercial and industrial equality; provided that the Mandatory shall be free to organise essential public works and services on such terms and conditions as he thinks just.&quot;6. I am to request, therefore, that the Secretary of State may be favoured with your advice on the point whether the attachment to the British guarantee of the proposed Loan of a formal condition that all non-local expenditure shall be in the United Kingdom would be in any way inconsistent with the terms of the Article of the Mandate quoted above.I am, .&amp;c.J. E. SHUCKBURGH.III.Law Officers7 Department, Sir, Royal Courts of Justice, March 16, 1926.WE were honoured with your commands, signified to us in Sir J. E.

A copy of the Mandate for Palestine is enclosed.* The question appears to be governed by the interpretation to be placed on Article 18 of the Mandate, which provides that there shall be &apos;&apos; no discrimination in Palestine against the nationals of any State Member of the League of Nations (including companies incorporated under its laws) as compared with those of the Mandatory or of any foreign State in matters concerning taxation, commerce or navigation, the exercise of industries or professions, or in the treatment of merchant vessels or civil aircraft. Similarly, there shall be no discrimination in Palestine against goods originating in or destined for any of the said States, and there shall be freedom of transit under equitable conditions across the mandated area.&quot;6. I am to request therefore that the Secretary of State may be favoured with your advice on the point whether the attachment to the British guarantee of the proposed loan of a formal condition that contracts for expenditure incurred out of the loan should be given to British and not to foreign firms would be in any way inconsistent with the terms of the Article of the Palestine Mandate quoted above.7. As it is proposed that the Palestine Loan Bill should be brought before the House of Commons at an early date, it would be convenient if Mr. Amery could be furnished with your opinion on the above question at the earliest possible date.I am, &amp;cJ.

attached to the proposed Loan to the Government of that country a formal condition that any contracts for works of development to be paid for out of the Loan should be given to British, and not to foreign, firms.We have taken the matter into our consideration, and in obedience to your commands have the honour to report That we answer this question in the same way as that propounded with regard to Tanganyika. The language of the Article in question is not quite the same; and it might be stated that the effect of the condition is to create a discrimination in Palestine against the nationals of all States as compared with British nationals in a matter concerning commerce, namely, the execution of public works. But we have come to the conclusion that on its true construction the Article has the same meaning as Article 7 in the Tanganyika Mandate; and that it does not apply to the attach-ment of a condition to a guarantee of the character suggested in the question.We have, &amp;c.DOUGLAS McGAREL HOGG.

INSKIP.IV.The Secretary of State,Colonial Office, S.W. 1.Law Officers&apos; Department, Sir, Royal Courts of Justice, March 16, 1926.WE were honoured with your commands, signified to us in Sir J. E. Shuckburgh&apos;s letter of the 5th instant, requesting us to favour you with our opinion on the question whether the attachment to the proposed British Guaranteed Loan to East Africa of a formal condition that all non-local expenditure shall be in the United Kingdom would be in any way inconsistent with the terms of Article 7 of the Mandate for the Tanganyika Territory.We have taken the matter into our consideration, and in obedience to your commands have the honour to report That in our opinion the attachment to the British guarantee of the proposed Loan of a formal condition that all non-local expenditure should be in the United Kingdom would not be inconsistent with the terms of the Mandate. We regard the provision of Article 7 as a stipulation that the Mandatory should insist that all nationals should be equally treated in the territory; but we do not think that this prevents the attachment of a condition to the granting of a guarantee that the money raised on that guarantee should be spent in the country of the guarantor.We have, &amp;c.DOUGLAS McGAREL HOGG.T. W. H. INSKIP.
