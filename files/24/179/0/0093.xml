Our first Report (CP, 189 (26 ) ) was approved by the Civil Constabulary Reserve Committee of the Cabinet on the 8th May,  1926 (0.1. 191 (26));    ana all consequential action was initial 3d forthwith,,      vve now desire to put forward certain further recommendations.2.      The instructions received from the Cabinet Committee in regard to the formation of the Reserve included the following:-uTho Secretary of State for War will,  for the&apos;next few days at any rate, not rooruit for the Civil Constabulary Reserve any outsider,  except ex:-Military Men known and trusted at the Territorial Headquarters.11 (CP.  187 (26) Conclusion 4), In accordance with the above instructions the following clause was inserted in the schomo for the formation of the Civil Constabulary Reserve&quot;Paragraph 3.    The following are eligible:-(a) Officers and other ranks of the Territorial Army and Senior Contingents of the Officers Training Corps.(b)    Sx-Military men who can be vouched for atTerritorial Army Units Headquarters.&quot;We consider that there are certain classes of men,  such as underUniversity/graduates, who may not fall into either ox the
above categories but who would, nevertheless.; be eminently-suitable for the Force.We therefore roc omul end that enrolment should be thrown open to any reputable person,  irrespective of whether he falls into either of the above categories, at the discretion of District Administrator.-3,      In our first Report  (0.1&apos;. 189 (26 )) we stated that, so far as London was ooncerned -(a)    The schome was to be confined in the first instance to tha County of London Area; lb)    That,   in the first instance, provision would be made for a force of 10^000 men, 4.      In regard to (a) we recommend that the scheme should now be extended to include the whole Metropolitan Area* In this connection we consider it desirable that the detailed arrangements for tho Units whioh aro to be formed outside the London Area, should be somewhat different to those which obtain for the Units being formed within that Area.    We reoornmend that the personnel., of the former should live in their own houses, concentrate at certain selected Drill Rhlls when required for dutyP and be transported to and from the soeno of their employment - whioh will, generally speaking, be the vital centres such as the London Dock Area - under arrangements which will be made by the Chief Commissioner of Police in conjunction with tho Ministry of Transport.5,-      In regard to (b) the Chief Commissioner of Police has informed us that he considers 20,000 mon to be the maximum number which he is likely to require.    Wo therefore ask for the authority of the Cabinet Committee to make provision for enrolment up to a maximum of 20,000 in the Metropolitan Area *
