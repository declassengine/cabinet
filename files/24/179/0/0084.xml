&amp; fi QTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OB1 HIS BR1TTANNICMAJESTS&apos;S 00V3RNMENT. . .11. .1.1,. 11,. i   i i in iC P   184  (26) pABINET Copy NoProposed circular to Boards of Guardians respecting scales of relief during the strike.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.In view of the General Strike it Is to be anticipated that a great strain will be thrown on the administration of Guardians In many parts of the country, and I have come to the conclusion that it is desirable to give some guidance to Boards of Guardians by means of &amp; circular.An important question arises as to the advice that should be given as to the scale of relief to be adopted.     There Is no - standard scale of poor relief, and the amount of relief granted varies in different Unions.     Where a scale is adopted it Is an income rather than a relief scalei the practice of Guardians being to give suoh amount of relief as will bring the income of the household applying for relief up to a definite figure.In present circumstances it is to be anticipated that there may be very large numbers &apos;of applications for relief arising directly or Indirectly out of the dispute and it will probably be necessary for Guardians to adopt some defined scale Of relief or to review their existing scales.     It will be of great, importanoe that Guardians should take all possible steps to conserve their financial resources in face of the demands that will be made upon them-. -
In 1921 a rule vi&amp;s adopted, with the concurrence of the Cabinet, that where a loan was sanctioned to enable a Board of Guardians to meet the exceptional expenditure occasioned by the dispute, such loan should be subjeot to a condition that the scale of relief (the scale being an Income scale) to be adopted by the Guardians should not exceed -20/- for man and wife (where both could properly begranted relief) 15/- for a woman (e.g. the wife of a miner to wham inview of the Merthyr Tydfil judgment relief maynot properly be granted) 5/- for each child.Under this scale the income for man, wife and 2 children would be a week. In the case of the miner&apos;swife with 2 children the income would be 25/- a week.The scale en which unemployment benefit is paid is 18/- weekly for a man, 5/- for a wife, 2/- for each child -I,e. 27/- a week for family with 2 children.     The rate of Unemployment benefit payable to an Insured women is 12/-per week.     If this were applied to the case of the minerfs. wife the family with two children would receive 16/*- a week.In some industrial unions the unemployment benefit scale is adopted and there is much to be said for requiring that this should be observed as a maximum;    In many urban unions a much higher scale Is In force.I think that the best solution on the present occasion will be to direct the attention of Guardians to the rates of unemployment benefit as being appropriate to the ordinary case, where the award of relief covers the man as well as the wife and children and where no conditions of exceptional need are present.     Where, however, the man is debarred from relief by reason of the Merthyr Tydfil judgment, the ordinary unemployment
benefit of 5/- per week for the woman and 2/- per week for each child will be quite inadequate.      In these ossea I should-propose to say tnat where no conditions of exceptions! need exist the woman and each child may receive a maximum of 12/- and 4/- per week respectively and to defend those figures (1) by reference to the allowance of 12/- per week ordinarily paid to an insured woman and (2) as representing a rather more liberal payment than what was found reasonable in 1921, when allowance is made for the fall in the oost of living figures since then,I should be glad if the Cabinet will concur in the course proposed.N.C9
