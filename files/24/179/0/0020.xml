IMF!DENT!AL LIBRARY [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]        &apos;Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1926.SECRET.Copy No. 30CP. 120 (26).CABINET.Irak Policy Committee.SECOND REPORT.THE First Report of the Committee (CP. 89 (26) (Revise)) was approved by the Cabinet on the 3rd March, 1926.   (Reference Cabinet 9 (26) 3.)2. The Committee reassembled on the 18th March in order to hear the views of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Constantinople, Sir Ronald Lindsay, in regard to the general instructions which should be given to him for his guidance in negotiations with Turkey.3. The Committee reviewed the recommendations contained in their First Report in the light of the opinions expressed by Sir Ronald Lindsay and the Chief of the Air Staff, and also considered certain new proposals. The conclusions at which they arrived are summarised in the following paragraphs: Territorial Concessions.4. It cannot be expected that mere rectifications of the Brussels line, such as ceding to Turkey the two salients at its eastern end, will offer any sufficient attraction to the Turkish Government, whose prestige in Turkey was severely shaken by the League Council&apos;s decision of the 16th December. Sir R. Lindsay should be authorised, if it be practicable, to offer some more substantial concessions which would look well on the map; but we must avoid the transfer of any considerable population such as would create serious unrest throughout Irak, increase our administrative difficulties and our military expenditure, and be impossible to defend before Parliament and the League of Nations. The possible limits of such further concessions south of the central and eastern sections of the Brussels line are being examined by the Colonial Office in detail, with special reference to tribal conditions and the distribution of population. Territorial concessions, in Sir R. Lindsay&apos;s opinion, are the only effective form which, our offers to Turkey can take. If the present Brussels line remains unaltered, there will be no real peace with Turkey and no consequent reduction of British commitments in Irak; and the Angora Government will enter into still closer political, and possibly also into military, co-operation with Soviet Russia.It must, however, be noted that before any Irak territory can be ceded to the Turks the prior sanction of the Council of the League will have to be obtained. Article 8 of the Treaty with Irak definitely precludes the cession or lease of Irak territory to any foreign Power.Reduction of Forces in Irak and Turkey.5. It is suggested that in order to convince the Turks of our pacific intentions, and   to demonstrate that we do not suspect them of aggressive designs, we should offer to reduce the Imperial garrison in Irak by one or two squadrons, and/or battalions as soon as climatic conditions allow, obtaining&quot; if possible some quid pro quo in terms of security, such as the withdrawal of a Turkish division from the vilayets north of the Irak frontier. In the last resort we need not even insist on such a quid pro quo, for our forces in Irak are in any case not sufficient to meet airy serious Turkish aggression, and we cannot really control the Turks whether they withdraw their troops or not. The agreement to be reached on this subject should not be embodied in a hard and fast written and signed document, but  should be a &quot; gentleman&apos;s agreement&quot; exchanged[14337]
verbally between Sir R. Lindsay and the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs in agreed terms, and recorded by Sir R. Lindsay in an official despatch to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The reduction of British forces must of course be contingent on the continuance of a settled state of affairs in Irak.Mutual  Anglo-Turkish   Engagement  to  respect the Turco-lrak Frontier eventually agreed upon.6. This was recommended in the Coiumittee&apos;s first x&quot;epoi&apos;t (paragraph 13, heading (1)), and the recommendation still stands.A Turco-lrah Frontier Commission for Tribal Affairs.7. The institution of a commission of this kind would be of great advantage from the military and administrative points of view; it would provide a convenient means of settling minor frontier incidents (which are often due to local Turkish officials getting out of hand) and preventing them developing into serious disputes. The Turco-Syrian agreement recently signed by M. de Jouvenel at Angora ad referendum is known to include arrangements for the suppression of bands, and His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Paris have been asked to obtain further details about it, which will be useful for Sir R. Lindsay&apos;s guidance.A Turco-lrah Extradition Treaty.8. The Turks are known to set store by this, and His Majesty&apos;s Government should use their good offices to bring it about. It will, however, require to be framed with care so as to distinguish between criminal and political offenders.Status of Irak, Subjects in Turkey.9. An agreement on this subject is desirable, since Turkey has not yet formally recognised the existence of Irak. The recent Turco-Syrian agreement includes arrangements regarding the status of Syrians in Turkey, which may prove useful as a model.Duration of Agreements eventually reached.10. The agreements should remain in force as between Great Britain and Turkey for the period during which the present British connexion with Irak lasts, and should provide that on the expiration of that period the obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be taken over by the Irak Government.Prospects of Turkey accepting the Offers indicated above.11. Nothing definite can be said on this point in view of the abnormal conditions prevailing at Angora, where everything depends on the whim of one man (Mustafa Kemal). Sir R. Lindsay must be given the widest discretion as regards tactics in putting forward the various proposals, and must feel his way hi the light of the answers returned to each of them.Other Proposals contained in the First Report. -12. Sir R. Lindsay is strongly of opinion that no use can be made in negotiation with the Turks of three other offers previously contemplated, viz., (a) extension of the Bagdad Railway to Mosul ; (6) reassurances regarding British policy towards the Kurds ; (c) Turkish participation in oil concessions. As regards id), the Turks already have on hand a vast programme of railway construction in Turkey proper, in which they are far more interested than in the extension of the Bagdad Railway; they could not put up any money for the purpose; and if the extension were built with English money, the Turks would suspect that Great Britain had territorial designs westwards towards Diarbekir. As regards (b), j to reassurances will carry any weight at Angora so long as we have bo admit that the Kurds in Irak enjoy such privileges as the teaching of Kurdish in the schools, &amp;c. As regards (c), the Turks would probably regard the grant of royalties to them as some sort of shadowy recognition of Turkish sovereignty over the Mosul vilayet.Signed on behalf of the Committee :SALISBURY,Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1.
