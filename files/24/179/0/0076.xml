0.3.4.P.175(26)THIS DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GCYER.:  iTSEC RET . CABINET.PAY OP SERVICE PERSONNEL EMPLOYED DURING  . AN  INDUSTRIAL EMERGENCY \Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.With reference to C.P.173(26), I should like to state at somewhat greater length the reasons for the Admiralty view on this subject.It seems clear to the Admiralty that, if criticism is to be avoided,  it is necessary, In dealing with the question of Government intervention in Industrial disputes., to observe the following principles :-(a) That the Government should not be open to the charge of supplying cheap labour, and(b) that the Department supplying the labour should not make a profit out of the transaction.In framing the Admiralty arrangements for the paymentof Naval personnel employed In connection with Industrialemergencies the-seAtprinciples have been borne in mind.     Thepresent system dates from February 1919, when, on the occasion of a threatened strike.of electricians, it was decided, withthe sanction of the Treasury, to pay double rates of extra pay to Naval personnel brought to London in connection with theemergency.      It was originally considered that Naval personnelactually employed ,on industrial work should receive paymentat the Trade Union rates appertaining to the grades of civilian labour for whom they were substituted, but there were found to be administrative difficulties, in effecting thisproposal, not the least of which was the fact that the Navalpay of the more senior Naval ratings together with theirMarriage .
Allowances amounted to more than the Trade Union rates then payable to their civilian equivalents.      The need for the actual employment of the Naval personnel in the Power Stations did not arise on the occasion referred to above, but in the light of the information then gleaned in anticipation of such a contingency, it was decided to abandon the Idea of paying Trade Union rates during employment, the conclusion reached being that all essential requirements would be met and simplicity In administration secured by the following financial arrangements(a) The Naval Officers and men employed during an emergency to be paid their Naval empluments plus double extra pay, both whilst &quot;standing by&quot; and whilst actually employed on industrial work.(b) The Industrial undertakings benefiting from the loan of the Naval personnel topay over to the Admiralty a sum representing the civil pay for which they would have been liable had their works, etc., been manned by civilians instead of by Naval personnel, calculated on the number of hours worked by the latter.If the arrangements contemplated by the war Office were adopted and Service personnel loaned to industrial undertakings were paid bare Service rates of pay, if these only were reclaimed from the undertakings concerned, an opportunity would at once arise for the Government to be charged with supplying cheap labour.     On the other hand, if trade union rates are reclaimed, It seems possible that a profit would.result to the Department concerned,.and the personnel employed would be dissatisfied.Cn the few occasions on which it has been necessary actually to employ Naval personnel on the maintenance of industrial services, (e.g. strike in the Yorkshire Coalfield, 1919:  strike of electricians at Greenwich Power Station,1921) , Admiralty claims on the above basis have been met by the undertakings concerned.T 4*JL it   t * * * *
It will be observed that in addition to receiving double extra pay whilst actually employed, Naval personnel also receive this emolument whilst they are held in readiness for such work, away from their Ports or Shipsa     This payment which remains a charge to Navy Votes.,, is considered to be amply justified by the unpleasant nature of the duty, and the risk of obloquy, etc., run by the personnel engaged in it, particularly when regard is load to the fact that such duties are extraneous to those for which the Officers and men engage when entering the Royal Navy.As regards the allusion to the Defence B&apos;orce raised in connection with the emergency of 1923., when II aval personnel Is employed on duties analogous to those for which the Defence Force was presumably raised (loQ-i protection duties, defence of vulnerable points, etc j,) no extra remuneration is paid, such employment being regarded as part of the ordinary duties of the armed forces of the Crown *
