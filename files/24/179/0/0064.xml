Copy No.COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from, the Minutes of the 211th Meeting, held on March 29, 1926.(1.)-SITUATION IN CHINA WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO CANTON.(OLD. Papers Nos. 677-B and 681-B.)(Previous References : C.I.D. Minutes of 202nd Meeting, Minute 3, and210th Meeting, Minute 3.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report by the Chiefs of Staff on the situation in China, with special reference to Canton (C.I.D. Paper No. 677-B), and a Report by the Advisory Committee on Trading and Blockade on the subject of the Blockade of the Approaches to Canton (OLD. Paper No. 681-B).LORD BEATTY AND HIS COLLEAGUES had nothing to add to their Report.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, in reply to the Prime Minister, said that the chances of obtaining international agreement on any measures which might be taken with regard to the boycott of Hong Kong were not good. On a recent occasion the International Delegations in Peking had been approached with discouraging results. Methods of patience and caution appeared to offer the only hopes of a solution. Although the situation looked better momentarily, it changed too often for him to say at present whether the outlook was definitely brighter.LORD CECIL remarked that from a Colonial Office telegram which had recently been circulated, it appeared that there was already a shortage of rice in Canton. If this were so, the chances of success of a blockade were improved.* He drew attention to the fact that one condition for a successful blockade was the blocking of the West River by a gun-boat stationed between Wu-Chou and Canton. No doubt the Naval Staff would examine the possibilities of taking such a step.Mr. AMERY said that the situation was an extremely anxious one for Hong Kong. He had hoped that more could have been done in the way of blockade than had transpired from the Report of the Advisory Committee, and suggested that the Naval and Military Staffs should study carefully the question of what methods were the most likely to ensure international agreement.Conclusion.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (a.) To take note of the Report of the Chiefs of Staff on the Situation in China (C.I.D. Paper No. 677-B) and the Report of the Advisory Committee on Trading and Blockade on the subject of a Blockade of the Approaches to Canton (OLD. Paper No. 681-B).(b.) That the Secretary should circulate these Reports to the Cabinet for information.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, March 29, 1926.* Note by the Secretary.-Subsequent to the meeting&apos;, however, a telegram has been received from Canton to the effect chat &apos;tlie last crop was the best for many years, having&apos; exceeded the previous crop by 60 per cent.[14369-1]

Copy No.    61677-B.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.SITUATION  IN CHINA, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO CANTON.(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 617-B.)Report by the Chiefs of Staff.1. The Committee of Imperial Defence at its 210th Meeting agreed &quot; That the Chiefs of Staff should be asked to review the situation and plans for dealing with any emergency which might arise at Hong Kong or elsewhere as the result of the disturbed conditions at Canton.&quot;2. In June 1925 we examined the situation in China and submitted a Report (OLD. Paper No. 617-B), in which we reviewed all our interests in the various parts of that country.3. Since that date there has been no change of any appreciable significance in the military situation, while, as regards political affairs, the forecast which was then made by the Foreign Office of the probable trend of events has been fulfilled in a remarkable manner. The views expressed and the recommendations contained in our last Report (OLD. Paper No. 617-B) may therefore be accepted as applicable to the situation as it exists to-day, and we invite attention to its provisions.4. We have had the application of our earlier Report to the particular case of Canton examined by a Joint Staff Conference of the three Services, and we concur in their Report, which is as follows : &quot; It was unanimously agreed that the only practical measure that can be taken is to institutes blockade of the approaches to Canton. It was further agreed that (a.) The blockade of Canton presupposes and necessitates prior inter-national agreement. (A statement is attached (Appendix I) showing the international character of the shipping using the port of Canton in 1924, from which it is evident that a large number of nations are affected.)(b.) The evacuation of Shameen would be an essential preliminary to the institution of a blockade, as otherwise the necessity for protecting the Shameen would involve us in military commitments on a large scale for the protection and maintenance of its non-Chinese inhabitants.(c.) Subject to the evacuation of Shameen having been effected, the bombardment of selected objectives, such as Bocca Tigris and Whampoa Forts, or the Whampoa Military College, would be of little or no military value, and is not recommended.It  was decided to  draw attention to Telegram No.  83,   dated  the 1st January, 1926, from Sir R. Macleay (copy attached, Appendix II).   Should[14319]
the events foreshadowed by Sir R. Macleay materialise, a good opportunity to invite and obtain the co-operation of other Powers in the institution of a blockade would be presented, with the added advantage that the coercion of Canton would then be carried out on behalf of and in the interests of the Peking Government.(Signed) E. T. Humphreys,Colonel, D/D., M.O. &amp; I. C. L. N. Newall,Air Commodore, Director of Operations and Intelligence, Air Ministry.W. A. Egerton,Captain, R.N., Director of Plans, Admiralty.&quot;5. It will be seen that in regard to Canton the only practicable measure of coercion which can be applied is the institution of a blockade of the approaches to that port. The extent to which such a blockade is likely to prove really effective is a matter which a.ppears to require further investigation, and we recommend that an opinion as to its value should be sought from the Advisory Committee on Trading and Blockade.6. If from the enquiries of the Advisory Committee on Trading and Blockade it is established that the application of economic pressure on Canton is likely to prove an effective measure of coercion, and a situation arises in which the Cabinet decides that such a blockade should be instituted, we recommend that the Foreign Office should consider the advisability of issuing a warning to the Cantonese Authorities to the effect that a stringent blockade will be enforced unless normal relations are resumed and Treaty obligations are observed by a certain date. It will of course be for the Foreign Office to decide the psychological moment at which such a warning, if desirable, should be issued, but it is essential that the Commander-in-Chief on the China Station should be advised at an early date of the intention to make a pronouncement of this nature, so that he may be ready to put the requisite measures into force immediately should the necessity arise.7. Lastly, in the event of the Authorities at Canton proving obdurate and refusing to submit to such coercive treatment as can be imposed by means of blockade, we think it right to emphasise once again the following passage from our earlier Report: &quot; Offensive action in China can only be international, and even on that basis it would probably be unprofitable, except possibly for Japan, who must be the predominant partner.&quot;(Signed) BEATTY.GEO.

Macleay, Peking, to the Foreign Office, dated march 1, 1926.(No. 83.)FOLLOWING is continuation of my immediately preceding telegram : &quot; Should struggle now proceeding between Wu Pei-fu and his adherents against Kuo Min-chun and present Radical Government in Peking, and in victory for former and formation of more Conservative coalition Government, it is more than probable that Canton Government will at once proclaim their complete independence and launch an attack on coalition from the south. In such an event a formal protest by us to Central Government against continued boycott of Hong Kong and breach of treaties by Cantonese would probably elicit a repudiation of their action towards Great Britain which should strengthen the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government in any discussion in regard to situation in the south, on which they may think fit to embark with other Powers.&quot;Addressed to Foreign Office, No. 83, repeated to Hong Kong.
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;&amp; Government.,]   726Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  March 1926.SECRET. Copy No.681-B.COMMITTEE  OF   IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.BLOCKADE OF THE APPROACHES TO CANTON.Report of the Advisory Committee on Trading and Blockadein Time of War.WE were requested to consider, and report on, the extent to which a blockade of the approaches to Canton, undertaken with prior international agreement, is likely to prove effective. An attempt to answer this question, on which we have had the benefit of the opinion of Sir Reginald Stubbs, late Governor of Hong Kong, is given below, but it must be emphasised that all consideration of political reactions* arising from this step have been omitted, except in so far as they immediately concern the efficiency of the measures contemplated.Imports.2. The principal imports into Canton are shown in Appendix No. 1. Their origin cannot be stated with statistical accuracy.Of these imports, the three most important in the daily life of the Cantonese are rice, the Southern Chinaman&apos;s bread; ground nuts, his butter; and firewood, which he uses largely for culinary purposes.3. Rice. Expressed in terms of weight, Canton imports yearly by sea about 300,000 tons of rice. In 1924 about half this amount came by sea from other parts of China.Ground Nuts. About 108,000 tons are imported per annum. The statistics show that these come almost entirely from China and from the fact that they are largely of local growth and could probably in any case be replaced from inland by other native products, their importance from a blockade point of view is less than that of rice.Firewood. Supplies of firewood come entirely from Chinese sources and originate mainly from Kuang-Hsi province. They are brought to Canton by river transport.   The quantity is large, but unknown.^ 4. Of the imports enumerated in Appendix No. 1, it would seem possible, by blockade of the seaward approaches to Canton alone, to cut off all supplies of fuel except firewood, and of illuminants, except in so far as ground nut oil might be used; to diminish the common cereal supply very seriously; and to lessen slightly the amount of fatty substances available.The effect of cutting off supplies of cotton textiles is economic and could not be immediate; experience has shown that, except when dealing with a power which utilises cotton textiles for narrowly military purposes, this restriction is only useful if extended for a period of about two years.* These political reactions were discussed in Foreign Office prints Confidential, F/513/1/10, of the ^rd February, 1926, Section 1, and F/439/1/10 of the 17th February, 1926, Section 1.,[14355] a
a5. It will be seen from the above that upon rice and firewood depends the success of the whole project.1  f)&apos; Rice.6. A great part of the Chinese rice consumed in Canton comes from the Eastern district of the Kuang-Tung province and is transported to Canton in junks and launches by the creeks and small rivers which exist in this district, in addition to the Chinese rice imported by sea from other parts of China,Canton is the port of a populous sub-tropical province whose population has been long accustomed to inland water transport, the organisation of which poor though it may be is already in native hands. It is probable that, if from no loftier motives than high prices, the inhabitants will make an effort to supply whatever Canton lacks. In the Delta, too, there are numerous junk harbours which may be possible sources of difficulty, while Macao, although of no commercial importance, is already the resort of several accomplished smugglers and consummate masters of every form of maritime roguery.7. It would appear that naval measures in the estuary would be unable to stop completely supplies of rice to Canton, and that, in spite of the difficulties of land transport, which are referred to in paragraph 9 below, a certain quantity of rice might perhaps be brought in overland from the immediately surrounding districts. The crux of the matter is the nature of the latest rice crop. If there is an ample crop, a sufficient quanta will find its way through to support the population of Canton. If the crop is a poor one a not unlikely event, in view of the country having been overrun by various armies during the past four years Canton will be badly hit by naval measures in the estuary. In this connection it may be desirable to point out that, since rice cannot be stored for longer than three or four months without deteriorating, a limiting factor is placed on the food value of stocks accumulated to meet the situation we are now considering. On the other hand, however, there are at least two rice crops annually.Firewood.8. Supplies of firewood coming down the West River from Kuang-Hsi province to Canton must pass through Wu-chbu. If it were feasible to station a gunboat between the latter place and Canton, she could completely cut off supplies a measure which would cause serious hardship, but we have not examined, from a technical point of view, this question, or that of her maintenance up-river.Alternative Methods of Transport.9. &apos; The provinces of Kuang-Hsi and Kuang-Tung are conspicuous for the absence of efficient railways and roads. We are informed by Sir Reginald Stubbs that the Samshui-Canton line is out of order and that the Canton-Shao-Chou line has ceased to function. There are no roads inland, and transport of goods across country is rendered impossible by the nature both of the ground and of the brigands which infest it. Further, even the incentive of increased wages for cartage of goods would be unlikely to attract the necessary coolie labour, in view of the fact that under the conditions contemplated payment would be uncertain. For the above reasons we may safely assume that transport by water is the only practical method.Exports.10. The principal export of Canton is raw silk. The result of completely stopping what is left of this trade must be considered as a part of the general effect of the blockade.Sir Reginald Stubbs was of the opinion that a blockade would be of little effect unless the merchant class were at the time in a position to exercise influence If that were so, they might exert sufficient pressure-both political and economic-on the Government to induce them to resume normal relations with the outside world
Sir Reginald was quite clear that similar motives would not operate if the labouring classes were in power, since the effect of the blockade would not be sufficiently direct, though the reasons for his opinion were not so obvious. They seemed to be that the labouring classes would be able to get on somehow in spite of the blockade, and that the hardships inflicted might only enrage them. Indeed, he contemplated as an almost certain result that Canton would be burnt to the ground unless the labouring classes could be restrained. Further, an effective blockade would undoubtedly destroy the export profits of the merchants and probably reduce them to ruin. If this happened, since they were playing the part of milch cows to the Canton Government, it seemed not unlikely that the latter would clear out the moment they found that the source of their exactions had run dry. So that the present position of the merchants both political and financial might prove an essential factor in the problem of what would be the effect of the blockade. On this point Sir Reginald said that he was unable to give any trustworthy information, as he had been away from the country too long. He suggested that on this and other points further information might be sought from H.M. Consul-General at Canton.Financial Measures.11. A note by Mr. Hawtrey on this subject is attached as Appendix No. 2. It will be seen that even if a state of war existed, little could be done, and without a state of war, practically nothing.The Position of the Shameen in the Event of the Institution of a Blockade.12. The question arises as to whether restrictive measures could be applied without previously evacuating the long-established foreign community on the Shameen as well as missionaries throughout the Delta. Such a step would inevitably give a warning which might to some extent stultify our plans. A less obvious result of evacuation would be the difficulty in inducing the colony to return, once the ties of three generations were broken, and all real estate ravaged (as it might be), and burnt. It is certain, too, that the Chinese would oppose our former privileges, so much so that it is doubtful, whatever the result, whether we should ever win them back. Claims would also arise from injured foreign interests, not the least of which would come from the British section of the Canton-Kowloon railway.13. In the opinion of Sir Reginald Stubbs, it is impossible to forecast the attitude of the Canton Government towards the Shameen in the event of the institution of a blockade, but the foreign community could hardly be left without the protection of a force sufficiently strong to ensure its safety and the maintenance of supplies from Hong Kong. Sir Reginald put this force at half a Company of Indian troops. It is right to add that in his judgment the Shameen itself and the buildings thereon are of little value, though everything should be done to protect the lives of the foreign community.Summary of Conclusions.14. (1.) A blockade of Canton, undertaken with prior international agreement, will be sufficiently effective to cause the Canton Government to give way, if (a.) The latest rice crop has been a poor one.* .(&amp;.) In addition to the seaward approaches, the whole delta is patrolled and theWest River blocked by a gunboat stationed between Wu-Chou andCanton.(c.) The Canton merchant, as opposed to the labouring class, is in power at the time.If either of the first two conditions are not fulfilled the effectiveness of the blockade will be reduced accordingly, and if the third is not fulfilled, in the opinion of Sir Reginald Stubbs, the blockade would probably be ineffective.(2.) Such financial measures as can be taken will have an almost negligible effect.(3.) The foreign community on the delta should either be evacuated before action is taken, and the increased difficulty in carrying out our plans be accepted, or* A.telegram of enquiry on ibis subject has been despatched by the Department pf Overseas Tra.de,,,,; ;, [14355] B 2
sufficient military protection should be provided to ensure their safety if concentrated in the Shameen.(A-.) Although we have not considered the necessity or desirability from a political point of view of retaining the Shameen, we draw attention to the difficulties of re-establishing our position there, once evacuation has taken place.(Signed) CECIL (Chairman).R.

Appendix No. 1.CANTON TRADE.Memorandum prepared in the Board of Trade.The value of the direct imports into China in each of the three years 1922-1924, and the value of the imports recorded as from Hong Kong, Great Britain, Japan and the United States of America, are shown in the following table, the conversions from Haikwan taels having been made at the rates stated iu the reports of the Imperial Maritime Customs : Country whence Imported.	1922.	1923.	1924.	 &apos;000.	 &apos;000.	 &apos;.000	44,878	^13,156	44,655Great Britain	27,242	20,9-14	23,069Japan..	43,393	36,710	42,978United States of America ..	31,688	26,867	34,959All other Countries	35,018	37,346	44,570All Countries	182,819	K.5,023	190,231Imports into Shanghai amount to nearly half the total maritime imports into China. The imports into Canton, added to those into Kowloon and the railway traffic into Kowloon, represented only about one-tenth of the total imports into China. The imports into these latter Chinese Customs districts, and also into Lappa, Ivongmoon and Samshui, making up the Delta trade, were : Customs Districts.	1922.	1923.	1924.: .1&apos;:	 &apos;000.	 &apos;000.	 &apos;000.Canton	10,169	12,846	9,890Kowloon	8,993	5,559	9,378Kowloon railway traffic..	1,646	548	81Lappa	3,914	3,142	4,007Kong-moon     ...	1,683	2,613	2,442Samshui	920	1,409	1,408It will be seen that the railway traffic decreased rapidly in the period covered before it was entirely stopped.Canton has, in addition to its trade with foreign countries, a large import trade in Chinese produce from other ports in China. This amounted to  8,700,000 in 1922, to  8,700,000 in 1923 and to  11,300,000 in 1924. There was also a substantial value of treasure imported and exported.   The principal Chinese export from Canton is silk.The largest items of foreign import into Canton in 1924, with corresponding figures for each of the two preceding years, were as follows, the quantities shown being those retained after deduction of re-exports : (Quantities iu thousands.)Commodity and Unit of Quantity.		1922.	1923.	1924.Rice and paddy	lb.	421,992	993,408	365,350Wheat flour	lb.	01,220	60.624	66,220Salt fish	lb.	20,049	29,320	27,270Sugar	lb.	55,452	55,013	62,508Coal	tons	189	243	304Kerosene oil   ..	gallons	12,049	11,053	6.022Cotton yarns and tissues	 	1,790	1,481	1,025
The above-named items accounted for 60 per cent, by value of the 1922 imports for nearly 70 per cent, of the 1923 imports and about 55 per cent, of the 1924 imports. The remaining imports represented roughly the same aggregate value in each of the last two years.The imports of Chinese produce into Canton included the following principal items : (Quantities in thousands.)Commodity and Unit of Quantity.Ground nuts, kernels Ground-nut oil rice ..

Appendix No. 2.FINANCIAL PRESSURE. Note by Mr. Hawteey.[n case of a blockade of Canton it is unlikely that financial measures can play any but a subsidiary part.If there were a state of war, the non-Chinese banks might be prohibited from giving any direct assistance to banks and traders in Canton and from financing movements of goods in contravention of the blockade; but such a prohibition is likely to be difficult to enforce. European bankers are dependent on native compradores for understanding bills and documents. Communications among Chinese banks and financial houses in different parts of China work efficiently, though slowly Canton traders would find indirect outlets for their merchandise, and credits would be opened for it in favour of traders at other ports; the banks could only guard themselves against such evasions by making vexatious enquiries. The less scrupulous a European bank is, the more of this doubtful business it will do, to its own profit and the loss of its more conscientious competitors.. No doubt the native banks are in some degree dependent on the European banks and can (sometimes at any rate) be embarrassed by the withdrawal of facilities. If Canton merchants are cut off from oversea markets, they will have to receive advances, which the native banks will find difficulty in providing. The essential fact is the unsaleability of the merchandise, which makes it bad security for an advance. The difficulty may be surmounted by an advance from a Chinese bank to the merchant on his general credit, and an advance from a European bank to the Chinese bank on its general credit. It is the latter that needs to be prevented. In many cases the Chinese bank&apos;s credit will anyhow not be good enough ; but the greater the number of intermediaries, the less likely is this to be so at the last stage. Hence the difficulty about credit facilities being given by indirect routes.If there is no state of war, there may be difficulty about imposing any prohibition at all. Some of the banks might agree voluntarily to abstain from certain classes of business, but this is very unsatisfactory unless all competing banks are included. Legislation could perhaps be obtained in Hong Kong, but this would only touch transactions in the colony.(InitiaUed) R. G. H.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, March 20, 1926.

Copy No.   61617-B (Revised).(Also Paper No. C.0.S.-19 (Revised).)COMMITTEE  OF   IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.CHIEFS OF STAFF SUB-COMMITTEE.Situation in China.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.THE Committee of Imperial Defence, at its 200th. Meeting, held on the 22nd June, 1925, invited the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee to examine the possibility of despatching reinforcements to China, should the necessity arise. The Sub-Committee met on Tuesday, the 23rd June, and secured the assistance of Mr. Waterlovv, of the Far Eastern Department, Foreign Office, and General Sir A. Cobbe, Secretary, Military Department, India Office. Subsequently a Joint Note was prepared by the Naval, Genera] and Air Staffs, which contains a full appreciation of the present position and is concurred, in by the Chiefs of Staffs. We circulate the Joint Note as the annexure to this Report.British Forces in the Far East.2. The British forces now in the Far East are as follows : Naval Forces. The Far Eastern Squadron, including certain river gunboatswhich have been brought forward from reserve. Military Forces. One British battalion in iSlorth China, distributed between Tientsin and the Tientsin-Pekin Railway.One British battalion and one Indian battalion at Hong Kong, together with certain batteries and other units for the local defence of that place. Singapore : one British battalion and certain coast-defence units. Air Forces. Nil[For further details see the Appendices and annexure to this Report.]3. In 1914, notwithstanding that the general political situation in China was much better than at present, there were three battalions in North China, three at Hong Kong and one in Ceylon which could have been moved to the Far East in an emergency. The reduction to the present figure was arranged in 1921-22 as a result of the Report of the Geddes Committee on National Economy, when the curtailment of expenditure on the Services was considered of paramount importance.4. In present conditions no troops can be spared either from Singapore, where there is a large Chinese population, or from Hong Kong, where the situation is menacing. In fact, it is by no means improbable that a request may be received before long from Hong Kong for a reinforcement of the garrison.5. Hence, to meet an emergency, the nearest place from which reinforcements can be drawn is India.British Interests in China.6. We are informed that, in the view of the Foreign Office, the British-interests in China, which have had to be considered, can be examined under four heads : (i.) North China. Pekin, where the Legations might be threatened :Tientsin : The Tientsin-Pekin Railway, which is protected by an international force under the 1901 Protocol ; and the property of the Kailan Mining Administration.[13268 a] * n
(ii.) Treaty Ports. Where there are foreign concessions and other interests.(iii.) Inland. Where there are British commercial interests, missionaries and other individuals whose lives and property may be threatened.(iv.) Canton. Which is now largely under Bolshevist control and might possibly develop into a serious menace to British interests and prestige in the Far East. - /North China. \7. As regards (i), the situation against which provision would have to be made is not unlike that which arose in 1899 at the time of the Boxer rebellion. It will be remembered that at that time an international relief force of some 2,000 men, under the command of Admiral Sir E. Seymour, started from Taku to relieve the Legations at Pekin, but was compelled to fall back upon Tientsin pending the assembly there of a larger international relief force.8. If similar trouble should arise at the present time, adequate protection could not be given in time by British forces. The battalion at Tientsin is required to assist in keeping open the railway. As already indicated, no troops can be spared from Hong-Kong or Singapore, and it is calculated that a force of one brigade from India could not arrive at Taku until about five weeks after the issue of the order, and this estimate corresponds closely with the time actually taken in 1899, when an Indian contingent was despatched to Taku at the time of the Boxer rebellion.9. We have considered whether any advantage would be obtained by sending a preliminary warning to the Government of India, so as to enable arrangements to be made for a rapid despatch of troops. Such a warning, however, woiild not result in a saving of more than one or, at the most, two days, since in India shipping is the limiting factor and the troops can be ready for embarkation as soon as the necessary sea transport can be rendered available.* Moreover, it would be difficult to keep secret any preliminary warning, and the Foreign Office would deprecate any leakage of information regarding preparations for the possible despatch of reinforcements to the Far East. In these circumstances we recommend that no advance warning should be given. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, however, is in touch on the subject with the Commander-in-Chief of the Army in India, who is now in this country, and has warned him in regard to the present situation.10. Consequently, in the contingency of a threat to, or an attack on, British interests in Pekin or Tientsin, we should have to rely on international action. There has been a tendency in China to isolate Great Britain and to direct public resentment mainly against this country. Nevertheless, it seems more probable that, if serious trouble arises, the interests of all the Western Eui-european Powers and of the United States of America will be equally in danger.11. We attach to this Report particulars of the international forces in North China (Appendix I). If further reinforcements were required, Japan is the only country in a position to furnish them rapidly. As already indicated, however, these could be reinforced at Taku within a period of five weeks by a brigade from India.The Treaty Ports.12. A considerable degree of protection is already being given to British and other foreign concessions and interests in the Treaty Forts (see Appendix II) by the British and other foreign naval forces in the Far East. The disposition of His Majesty&apos;s ships on the 2&apos;.ith June, 1925, is given in the annexure to this Report. No other means are available for affording protection. The Foreign Office are informed of the position of His Majesty&apos;s ships and can make suggestions as to where they would wish these to be moved, but, generally speaking, the disposition of the naval forces can best be left to the Naval Comuiander-in-Chief on the Station, who is in communication with the diplomatic and consular authorities.British Interests Inland.13. Naval forces can afford no protection except on the coast or in the navigable portions of the rivers of China. We are accordingly of opinion that the missionaries and other isolated individuals, if exposed to danger, should be withdrawn to ^ ports and other places where they can receive the benefit of naval protection, if this has not already been done.* This has been confirmed by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army in India (Field-Marshal Sir W. Birdwood), who has been in communication unofficially on this subject with the C.I.G-.S.
[13268 a]* Also C.O.S.-20.14. We desire to draw attention to the bearing of recent events on the provision of modern gun-boats for use on the rivers of China, which has been recommended by the Foreign Office and is under consideration elsewhere. It is only by means of these vessels that adequate protection can be provided.Canton.15. We are informed by the Foreign Office that the present disturbance in China is a symptom of a large-scale nationalist movement directed against the positions of foreign Powers, particularly this country, and fomented and exploited by the Soviet Government, which is making systematic use of the opportunity to injure vital British interests in a part of the world where they are most vulnerable. One of the centres of Bolshevist control in China in the future is likely to be at Canton, where there is already a military school which shows signs of considerable efficiency. This school has been financed to a large extent by Soviet agents in Canton, and has been assisted in other ways by the Soviet Government. Accordingly, in the view of the Foreign Office, the situation may develop in such a way that it may become desirable for Great Britain to take some action to counteract these Soviet activities.16. At first sight it would appear that the easiest way to strike a blow at Canton would be by means of Air forces based on Hong-Kong. The matter, however, presents considerable difficulties. There is considerable doubt as to whether the construction of an Air base at Hong-Kong is permissible under the terms of article 19 of the Washington Treaty on Limitation of Armament, a question which forms the subject of a separate report (C.I.D. 248-C).*Apart from this question, however, great difficulty and expense would be involved in the. provision of an aerodrome owing to the absence of any suitable site. In an emergency, bombing machines would have to work from carriers, and the only aircraft which could make use of Hong-Kong itself would be single-seater fighters working from the recreation ground in Happy Valley, where an aerodrome might be improvised, though not without difficulty. Until a carrier has arrived on the China station no action could be taken by air against Canton.Putting aside the question of aerial action, the question of offensive action against Canton is a part of the general question of military operations against China.Offensive Action.17. On this wider question we invite the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence to the Joint Note by the Staffs (see annexure to this Report), the Conclusions of which are stated in the following extract: &quot; From the naval and military point of view, it is essential to realise that offensive action on a large scale is not possible in China for the British Empire acting alone. China is a vast country offering no decisive military objective. Given time for preparation, the necessary troops and the acquiescence of the other foreign Powers, it might be possible to capture Pekin. Canton or one of the great towns near the coast. These could be held to ransom or destroyed, or temporarily occupied. But that is the limit of the possibilities of offensive military action, which amounts to no more than a programme of raids. No finality is to be hoped, for from it. The force required in most cases would be considerable, varying from one to two or more divisions.&quot; Offensive action in China on a large scale can only be international, and even on that basis it would probably be unprofitable, except possibly for Japan, who must be the predominant partner.&quot;Reserve for the Far East.18. From the above report it will be seen that no reserve British military force which could be made available for the protection of British interests in China exists nearer than India, and that five weeks would elapse before an Indian force could be landed at Taku. We gather that in the viewr of the Foreign Office our military strength in these regions is in no way commensurate with the importance of British prestige and interests in China. From the table in Appendix I it will be seen that both France and the United States of America maintain larger forces in North China than Great Britain. The need for an increase in the strength both of our Naval Forces on the China Station and of the garrison of Hong Kong is emphasised in the Joint Note by the Staffs (see annexure to this Report), where it is pointed out that
&quot; the military significance of the present unrest lies rather in the promise it gives of further and more serious disturbances in the future than in any present danger.&quot; We feel bound to invite the earnest attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence to this consideration, and to the extent of our dependence on foreign, and particularly on Japanese, assistance for the protection of British interests in China in case of emergency.19. We consider that our military forces in the Far East should be increased so as to provide a small reinforcement in case of emergency, such as that with which we may any day be confronted. This reinforcement, we suggest, should consist, as a minimum, of an additional British and an additional Indian battalion at Hong-Kong.20. For the additional Indian infantry battalion there will be available certain Indian huts, which could be made fit for habitation at a small cost.21. No accommodation exists for an additional British battalion. We suggest, however, that the important British companies with extensive interests in China, who rely on us for military protection, some of which, we understand, do not pay British income tax, might be expected to contribute in some way to the cost of housing an additional British battalion at Hong-Kong.Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.22. (a.) The military significance of the present unrest in China lies rather inthe promise it gives of further and more serious disturbances in thefuture than in any present danger, (o.) In the event of threats to or attacks on the Legation or other Britishinterests in Pekin or Tientsin, no British military force other thanthe one battalion at Tientsin, is available.    The first reinforcementwhich could arrive would be one brigade from India ;  this could reach Taku in about five weeks from the date of the order to mobilise.During this period of five weeks reliance would have to be placed on international action, (c.) British interests in the Treaty ports are already receiving such protectionas is possible from the naval forces in the Far East, and no protectioncan be provided other than by the naval forces, which we recommend should be increased, (d.) British interests inland can&quot; receive no protection unless they are on thenavigable rivers.   Missionaries and isolated individuals if threatenedshould be withdrawn to the ports, (e.) Modern gunboats should be provided for use on the rivers in China. (/.) An increase in our military forces in the Far East is desirable so thata small reserve may.be available to meet emergencies such as thepresent.(g.) For the reasons given in the Joint Note circulated with this Report (see annexure) offensive action in China on a large scale is not possible for the British Empire acting alone, and finality could not be hoped for from any operation within our capacity. Offensive action on a large scale can only be international, and even on that&apos; basis it would probably be unprofitable, except possibly for Japan, who&apos;must be the predominant partner.(Signed) BEATTY.cavan.H.

June 30, 1925.CCS. 25. Joint Note by the Naval, General and Air Staffs.1. Present Situation.(a.) North China.At the moment there is no disorder in Peking or Tien-tsin, but there may be a conflict between the rival Chinese leaders Chang Tso-lin, of Manchuria, and Feng Yu-hsiang, known as the &quot; Christian General.&quot;Chang Tso-lin was last reported at Tien-tsin. His total army amounts to some 200,000 men. In comparison with other Chinese forces, his troops are well armed with rifles, machine guns and trench mortars. He maintains his own arsenal at Mukden, in Manchuria, where modern machinery has been installed. He has over 200 aeroplanes, of which a large number are unserviceable ; he also appears to be short of pilots. He has about 200 field guns. The Manchurian army is an organised army, but cannot be compared in moral or fighting efficiency with Japanese or European troops.Chang Tso-lin has moved about 40,000 men, representing 3 divisions, to the vicinity of Tien-tsin. In addition to these divisions he has 10 divisions along the Peking-Mukden Railway, close to the Manchurian border.Feng Yu-hsiang has a force of 3 divisions and 2 mixed brigades in and around Peking, amounting- to some 76,000 men. These troops are well disciplined. He has no established arsenal, but is known to be improvising one in the mint at Kalgan. He is reported to have received munitions from the Soviet authorities, including 4,000 machine guns. A press report states that he has also received SO light field guns, 40 heavy guns and 20 boxed cars of ammunition. Discipline apart, Fengs forces are less formidable than, those of Chang.
The present Government in Peking consists of Chang Tso-lin&apos;s nominees, whereas Feng is in. military occupation of the city.(b.) Shanghai.The students are still maintaining the organised strike, and negotiations for a settlement have failed. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps (for strength, see enclosure No. .1), assisted by foreign naval detachments, appear to have been successful in keeping order inside the International settlement. Isolated conflicts take place, and it is reported in the press that the students are still planning further outrages against foreigners.(c.) Hong Kong.The Canton secret societies have brought about an extensive strike by threats of reprisals, and the Chinese employees have left Hong Kong in large numbers. The Hong Kong Government appear to have the situation fairly well in hand, and the organisation of civilian personnel to maintain essential services has been put into force. The Volunteer force has been mobilised.(d.) Canton.The so-called South China Government at Canton is now openly under the influence of Soviet agents. A local demonstration resulted in firing on Shameen Island, which was replied to and silenced with the assistance of French marines. European women and children have been evacuated to Hong Kong, and two platoons of Indian infantry have been sent from Hong Kong to safeguard property in the British and French concessions on Shameen Island.(e.) Other Treaty Ports. Disturbances are reported from Hainan Island, Swatow, Amoy and also in the Yangtze Valley.    Where possible, the British Admiral Commanding-in-Chief has sent gunboats to stand-by and, if necessary, assist the evacuation of foreigners.2. Possible Sources of Reinforcements and Attitude of Foreign Powers. (a.) Reinforcements.British. The nearest British garrison is at Singapore, but in view of the small size of this garrison and of the large local Chinese population, it would not be safe to count on any reinforcements nearer than India.French. Annamese troops would no doubt be available from Indo-China.American. The nearest reinforcement is from the Philippine Islands, but this would consist mostly of coloured troops. It is known that the American General Staff has worked out a scheme for reinforcing with a Brigade about 3,100 strong.Japanese.-Ample reinforcements are available in South Manchuria and Korea, where there are, in all, three Divisions. Certain units in the Liaotung peninsula are known to be earmarked for a rapid move in the event of disturbances arising in China.(b.) Attitude of Foreign Powers.The French have comparatively minor interests, but are always ready to riphold with vigour their treaty rights under the protocol of 1901. Their co-operation in North China is, therefore, assured, and in view of their concession in Shameen it is probable they would co-operate also at Canton.The American attitude is incalculable on every occasion.The Japanese are eager to co-operate in any international undertaking, but would not initiate any pressure to-day without the moral support of the other Powers.3. Future Developments.(a.) North China.The situation depends on whether Feng and Chang come to blows, and, if so, who wins. If Feng succeeds, it indicates the predominance of Soviet influence in the Peking Government, which will lead to further trouble.(b.) Shanghai.The situation is unlikely, at this stage, to develop into a dangerous outbreak, but much depends on the daily incidents, any one of which may cause a conflagration.
(c.) Hong Kong.So long as the strike continues, the present Hong Kong garrison will be rendered immobile.(d.) Canton.The Canton Government for many months has been organising anti-foreign measures by attempting to seize the customs and to levy illegal taxes on foreign goods. Therefore a repetition of such, or perhaps more drastic, measures can only be expected.(e.) Other Treaty Ports.Nothing beyond isolated rioting is considered likely to occur in the immediate future.The political trend of events shows that at no distant date the Chinese students&apos; cry of &quot;China for the Chinese&quot; will be sufficiently powerful to create, for the first time in history, a Government in China with a strong national spirit. The Bolshevik propaganda in China, as elsewhere, is being conducted on nationalist lines. Thus, this national movement is aimed largely against the foreigners in China and at the abolition of extraterritorial and other foreign treaty rights. Until that object is achieved, in and around foreign concessions, settlements and- treaty ports there is likelihood of constant, even ii only intermittent, trouble, caused by Chinese agitators or Bolshevist agents.4. The British interests in China, ior the protection of which Naval or Military action might become necessary, are,: (a.) The security of the Island and leased territory of Hong Kong, and of the concession at Wei-hai-wei. (6.) Participation in any action by the international force in North China to whichwe are committed by treaty, and the security of our contingent there, (c.) Safeguarding, so far as possible, the lives, property and interests of british nationals in China.5. In view of the extremely difficult country&apos; between the Island of Hong Kong and the northern frontier of the leased territory, the. existing regular garrison of Hong Kong (1 British battalion, 1 Indian battalion and certain R.A. and R.E. units), -together with the Volunteer forces, is considered sufficient to protect Hong Kong against any probable Chinese aggression from the north, at any rate until the arrival of reinforcements. It should, alternatively, be sufficient, together with the existing police forces, supplemented by the voluntary efforts of the European community, to secure internal order. But it could not deal with serious internal disorder and external aggression simultaneously without a reinforcement of at least two battalions.If the anticipated possibility of Canton coming permanently under Bolshevik influence materialises, the danger of simultaneous internal disturbances and external threats will increase, and will necessitate a permanent increase of the garrison.6. Our participation in the international force in North China is at present limited to one British battalion, the responsibilities of which include : (a.) Provision of Legation guard at Peking.(b.) Guarding a section of the railway from Peking to near Tientsin, (c.) Provision of detachment at Wei-hai-Wei.(d.) In time of trouble to play their part in keeping open communications between Peking and the sea.For the above duties a battalion is barely sufficient in normal times, and quite inadequate in case of serious trouble (see Appendix I to the Report by the Chiefs of Staff, C.0.8.-19 (RevisedThere are serious objections to a permanent increase of our force in North China, but some reinforcements should be available at short notice in case of emergency. Our onlv other garrison in the Far East Hong Kong-is, as shown above, at present sufficient only for the security of Hong Kong itself.7. British communities exist at all the principal ports and trading centres of China, and may also be found, as missionaries, in any part of China. The protection of all these cannot be a military responsibility.* Also C.i.D. Paper No. 617-B (Revised).
The only treaty ports at which we might have a potential military liability are : (a.) Tientsin (discussed in paragraph 6).(6.) Canton, by reason of its proximity to Hong Kong.(c.) Shanghai, by reason of the International force there, which is under a British commandant.8. The importance of the foreign settlements at Shanghai and the size of the International Volunteer Force maintained by the Municipality make it possible that the Volunteers might become so seriously involved as to require assistance.Here again the present size of the Hong Kong garrison does not admit of any substantial reinforcement in normal times, and of no reinforcement in the event of simultaneous trouble in Hong Kong itself.9. The permanent addition of two battalions (1* British and L Indian) to the garrison of Hong Kong would relieve any anxiet3T as to the security of our principal possession in the Far East, and would also provide a small reserve on which it might be possible to draw in an emergency for the reinforcement of the North China garrison or of Shanghai. It is for many reasons preferable to increase the Hong Kong garrison rather than that at Tientsin.The fact is that the policy of reduction has brought our military forces in China to below the safety limit.It must, however, be emphasised that this reinforcement would be only sufficient to enable the tasks outlined in paragraph 4 to be more efficiently performed. It would give no possibility of any offensive operation against China. If such is ever con-templated, it must be an International commitment, and the British quota must come from India. The initiation of such action, the scope of it, and the extent of the British share in it, are matters for the Foreign Office, and the future, and are beyond the scope of this note.10. Naval Considerations.(a.) Forces available.Available Naval forces and their present disposition are shewn in Enclosure No. 2. The disposition of these vessels can be altered to suit the changing situation as desired, or in the event of Military action being determined upon they could be utilised for convoying troops, covering landing operations or for bombarding strong points. As an essential preliminary to any offensive action it would be necessary to withdraw H.M. Ships now employed protecting British interests at certain settlements. It would he necessary, therefore, to evacuate European personnel from these places.(b.) Inadequacy of Present Forces. At the present moment all ships are employed, and there is no margin for reliefs. This cannot continue indefinitely.   Personnel and materiel will not stand it.   At the same time it is unlikely that we shall be able to strengthen our naval forces commensurate with possible developments.(c.) Reinforcements.No naval reinforcements can be depended upon at Hong Kong from other stations in less than three or four weeks from the time of orders being issued.11. summary the situation in China is a political and evolutionary puzzle which it is for the Foreign Office to appreciate.The military significance of the present unrest lies rather in the promise it gives of further and more serious disturbances in the future than in any present danger.There have been many examples of the plans of the Soviet Government going off at &quot;half-cock,&quot; but that does not mean that their policy of penetration and disintegrate-tion is more than temporarily checked, and in China there are stronger forces at work below the surface than Bolshevism. It is these stronger forces which must be considered in making plans for the future.This note deals only with the military and naval aspect of recent events.* N.B. This implies the employment on garrison duty iu the Mediterranean of a Guards&apos; Battalion, in order to make another Line Battalion available for service in China ; and the borrowing of an Indian Battalion from India, which would come on Army Votes.
From the naval and military point of view, it is essential to realise that offensive action on a large scale is not possible in China for the British Empire acting alone. China is a vast country offering no decisive military objective. Given time for preparation, the necessary troops, and the acquiescence of the other foreign Powers, it might be possible to capture Pekin, Canton, or one of the great towns near the coast. These could be held to ransom or destroyed, or temporarily occupied. But that is the limit of the possibilities of offensive military action, which amounts to no more than a programme of raids. No finality is to be hoped for from it. The force required in most cases would be considerable, varying from one to two or more divisions.Offensive action in China on a large scale can only be international, and even on that basis it would probably be unprofitable, except possibly for Japan, who must he the predominant partner.The military problem of the moment is the safety of our possessions, concessions, interests and nationals in China.Even protective military action is limited to localities where direct naval support can be brought into play, and to the security of the legations in Pekin and their communications to the coast.As stated above, it is the opinion of the combined Staffs that our present naval forces and garrisons in China are, in view of possible developments, inadequate. Temporary military reinforcement at short notice is impossible, for the simple reason that no reinforcements are available nearer than India, and these would take at least a month to organise and convey to Hong Kong. Thus the only way to provide against an emergency is to increase the garrison of Hong Kong.General Staff, June 30, 1925.Enclosure No. 1 to Annexure.Strength of Volunteer Forces in China.	Strength.
