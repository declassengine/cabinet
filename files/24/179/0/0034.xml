Note &quot;by the Secretary^On the Prime Ministers instructions the following letter addressed to him &quot;by the President of the Board of Education Is circulated for consideration at the next meeting of the Cabinet.fSgd.) M.p.Ao hankey secretary, Cabinet. , Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. 25th March, 1926.Board of Education,Whitehall,    S.W.1. 11th March, 1926.My dear Prime Minister,You will remember that you discussed with me the question of appointing a Cabinet Committee after the Easter Recess to consider the whole Education Question.    I am sure this is necessary, but there is one aspect of the question on which I may need advice during the next week or two and which could, I think, for the moment at any rate, be dealt with apart from the main question.      I am discussing, in a preliminary i&quot;ay, with Authorities on the subject of the best method of substit-uting Block Grants for Expenditure Grants and these discussions are &apos; reaching a point where I may have to formulate tentative proposals as to the method without, however, committing myself as to th.e amjouirt of grant.      The points which arise in connection with such proposals are closely connected with the similar problem
of Block Grants for Health Services, which v/as considered in a preliminary way last year by a Committee of the Cabinet on Bating, Valuation, -and Poor Law Reform-This Committee has not met for some time    I have spoken to the Minister of Health, who was Chairman of it, and he agrees that there will be some advantage in giving this Committee an opportunity of considering my problems.    I suggest, therefore, that you should ask the Cabinet to agree to this course..Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)      EUSTACE PERCY.The Right Hon.Stanley Baldwin, IvLP.10, Downing Street, S.W,1.
