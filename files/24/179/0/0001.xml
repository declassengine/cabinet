CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government). ^SORB. ^   L&apos;&apos;-- &quot; 0 A B I N E T.QJ?.l0l(S6) .JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS  (REGULATION OF REPORTS)  BILL. Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary.Major Kindersley has introduced a Bill  - copy attached -in the same form as the Bill which passed the House of Lords last year.      The Second Reading of this Bill is the first Order on Friday, the 16th April.     The subject has now beon before the House for several years, and the Bill commands strong support amongst--all parties.      On the other hand, some of its main provisions are opposed by a large section of the press.      It is important to settle at an early date what the Government attitude with regard to this Bill shall be.The provisions of the Bill are based on the Report of a Select Committee of 1923, the members being Lord Apsley, Sir Thomas Bennett, Mr. Oassels, Sir Evelyn Cecil, Mr.. Dunnico, Mr. Hardie, Mr. William Jowitt, Mr, McCurdy,  Sir Herbert Nield, Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland, and Mr. Warne.Major Kinderiiley&apos; s Bill is backed by Sir Evelyn Cecil, Mr. Fisher, Mr. Clynes, Sir John Simon, Sir Leslie Scott, Mr. J.H. Thomas, Sir Herbert Nield, Mr. Runciman, Lord Apsley, Major Birchall and Captain Bourne.As ry colleagues are aware, I had several conferences last year with representatives of the newspaper interests.      The group, of newspapers controllod by the United Newspapers, Limited, of which Mr. McOurdy is Chairman,  including the &quot;Daily Chronicle, and the &quot;Sunday News&quot;, are in favour of the Bill, but the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association, which represents most of the London papers other than the &quot;Chronicle&quot; group, and the News-paper Society, which represents most of the provincial papers, regard the Bill in its present form as unworkable.     My first attompts to get any alternative suggestions from the newspaper representatives who are opposed to the Bill were not success^:/
but when they at last realised that a Bill was likely to pass, they took the line that, while in their view the whole policy of a Bill was mistaken, yet if there was a general public demand for some form of legislation, the Bill should merely contain (l)  a provision re-stating the present law to the effect that it shall not be lawful to publish in relation to any judicial proceedings any indecent matter or any indecent medical,  surgical or physiological details;   &apos;(2)  a provision prohibiting publication in connection with matrimonial proceedings of any particulars other than the name, address and description of the parties, and the  judgment of the Court.      Subsequently the Press Association wrote to me saying, &quot;We feel that the logical outcome of prohibiting reports is the exclusion of the public from the Court, as otherwise distorted accounts of the proceedings would certainly be disseminated by word of mouth&quot;, and they accordingly asked that the Bill should also contain a provision that matrimonial proceedings should be heard in camera, except that  judgment should be delivered in open Court.. There are of course strong objections to the proposal that cases should be heard in camera, and the Select Committee of 1923 definitely decided against this course. They said, &quot;Your Committee are opposed to hearing cases in camera as contrary to British sentiment, unless in very exceptional circumstances where they are now allowed.      But we do not agree with the contention that there is no via media between hearings in camera and the right to. publish full reports of the divorce class of cases according to existing law.      At any rate, a middle course should be tried, particularly as we cannot insist too strongly upon the fact that it is often the contaminating character of the whole report rather than any individual phrase in it which is mischievous&quot;.
There is no doubt    that there will be a strong majority in the House in favour of this policy of a via media, but on the detailed provisions of the Bill difficult; questions arise. jClause 1(a) reads -j&quot;It shall not be lawful to print,  circulate or publish, or cause or procure to be printed, &apos; circulated or published -(a)  in relation to any judicial proceedings any indecent matter or medical,  surgical or physiological details being matter or details the publication of which would be calculated      \ to injure public morals or otherwise be to the   i public mischief.&apos;&apos;The first objection by the newspaper representatives is that these words would render liable to prosecution all the subordinate persons in a newspaper office including        ! not only the reporters but the printers and the distributing agents.      This, I think,  is a sound objection and the Clause ought to be  so amended as to make it clear that the   j persons liable are the responsible directors or editors        / who cause or allow the inclusion in the paper of matter prohibited by the Bill,The  second suggestion of the newspaper representatives is that Clause   (a)  should be amended to read &quot;in relation to any judicial proceedings any indecent matter or any indecent medical,  surgical Or&apos; physiological details&quot; and that the remaining words should be omitted.      They maintain that the insertion of the additional words would create a new offence and that it will be impossible for any editor to tell in borderline cases what a Court would or would not hold to be matter &quot;calculated to injure public morals or otherwise to be to the public mischief&quot;.      The Select Committee regarded the present Clause as &quot;containing little more than what is law today&quot; but they thought it had the advantage of &quot;giving more or less specific instructions to a news editor what is to bo blue-pencilled out&quot;    and it is,of course, possible to answer the objection    of thefnewspaper people by pointing out that the whole clause is
-A-10     ; Igoverned by the word &quot;indecent&quot; and that the words to which they object are merely explanatory and indicate that   li the clause only applies when such indecent particulars are   y.-. published as are calculated to injure public morals.      TheyJp however, will refuse to aetep-t-/this view and will make great play with the contention that on many controversial duestions,  such, for example, as the question of birth Control, there is divergence of opinion as to what mmpublications are or are not &quot;calculated to injure public       f- mmmorals or to &quot;be to the public mischief.&quot;      On the whole, therefore, I should be inclined to suggest that theHHGovernment should support a proposal to omit these words.As regards paragraph (b), the newspaper representative! criticised Clause  (ii) which allows &quot;a concise statement of p the grounds on which the proceedings are brought and\ ; TUSHresisted&quot; and Clause  (iv) which allows the summing up of the;B Judge, etc.      They say that a crude statement of the groundel on which the proceedings are brought and resisted may be       Jwmoro indecent than anything that is at present published       ; .IPin the press.      (They quote the Raper case as an example). they also say that in the summing up of the Judge there will frequently be references to the evidenoe and that to give a report of the summing up without any report of the ovidence would be misleading and might be unfair to witnessed The first objection is partly met by the provisomwhich says that nothing in this part of this subsection shall be held to permit the publication of anything which is prohibited by paragraph (a) on the ground of its indeoeno but the second objection seems to me strong, and I think there is much to be said for the press proposal that Clause (b)  should be limited to the names, addresses and1descriptions of the parties and the  judgment of the Court.I certainly the press will be able to make a very formidable     IIattack on the Clause as it stands by pointing    to the difficulties of a journalist who has to prepare truncated1
reports of cases within the limits prescribed by the Clause and to the inconsistencies which may result,.As regards subclause  (S),  the press representatives object to summary proceedings and want the Clause limited to convictions1 on indictments      This point was argued in the House of Lords in July last and the Lord Chancellor pointed out &quot;that there may be many offences under this Bill of quite a trifling character in which the  judgment of a Stipendiary Magistrate in London or Magistrates in other large cities will be all that is required.      If a person accused of an offence desires to appeal, he has an appeal to Quarter Sessions.&quot;      It seems to me that sufficient protection is provided by Clause  (3) which says that - no prosecution can be commenced without the sanction of the Attorney General, and that on merits the,provision as to summary convictions should be retained:    but there is no doubt that the press will make a strong fight for the &quot;right to be tried by a jury&quot;, and I would be prepared to make this concession for the sake of carrying the Bill.The main question on which a Cabinet decision is required is whether it is desirable entirely to prohibit reports of matrimonial proceedings and merely to allow publication^ of the names, addresses and descriptions of the parties and the  judgment of the Court.      The only strong objection of which 1 know to this proposal is the objection put to the Select Committee by the King1s Proctor who said that a good deal of the information he receives and upon which he acts &quot;is received In consequence of the publicity which is given to reports of divorce cases not only by the London newspapers but also local newspapers in the country&quot;. I am very doubtful, however, whether this consideration outweighs the general considerations in favour of prohibiting publicity.      1 agree with the opinion expressed by the Select Committee in the following terms - &quot;If it bo
maintained that limiting publication hampers the chances of justice,  the&apos;whole matter becomes a question of balancing&quot;the advantage of unrestricted publication to secure justice  as against the disadvantage of publication in lowering the  standard of national character.      Your Committee think that if a choice has to be made, the high standard of national character must be chosen.&quot;When I met the Press Representatives in August last 1 promised that after&apos; consultation with some of my colleagues I would prepare a revised Bill and shew it to the Newspaper Societies.      As no time could be found for progress in the Commons of last session&apos;s Bill action was postponed.      It is now very dedirable that 1 should  be in a position before April to draft and to shew to the Newspaper representatives the amendments to Major Kindersley&apos;s Bill which the Government will support.W.J .H.8th March,  1926.S50-55
