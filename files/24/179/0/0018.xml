TiiISj3QCUi::isITT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOyjjiRNHEN-T.) ..11J/26. 0 A E I II 35 T.COMMITTEE ON LONDON UNIVERSITY, KING1 s COLLEGE       288REPORT BY THE CHAIRMAN.With reference to Cabinot II (C6) Conclusion 9,  I give the following short summary of the faots in order to save the timo of tho Cabinot on Monday01.    In April, 1920, hr. Lloyd George&apos;s Government offered to acquire a cite of about llj: acres in Bloomsbury and to devote it gratis and in perpetuity to tho provision of a site for tho now Headquarters of the University of London, and for Colleges and Institutions connected with it,  including King&apos;s College, but made it clear that buildings could not be provided out of public funds02.    The Senate of tho University accepted the offor on the under-standing that the removal of King1 s College from, the Strand to the Bloomsbury site should be a matter for subsequent negotiation,,S0    The Government accordingly,  in 1921, purchased the site in question from the Bedford Estate for  425,000,  subject to tho condition that ;t if before the 1st April,  1926,  the Government shall find that they are able to use no partoof the premises for the purposes of the University of London,  they shall on or beforo that day offer the entirety of tho site to tho vendor at the price of  425,000, and that such offer shall remain open till the expiration of Bix months from the 1st April next&quot;.      It is further provided that &quot;if the land is not offered back to tho Duke., no building is to be erected on it except for University purposes;    and, until the site is developed for the University,  tho buildings at present standing on the property shall only bo used as private dwelling houBos&quot;.      if the site is offered back and the Bedford Estate decide not to re-purchase it,  then it is provided that &quot;no building now or hereafter erootod on the property shall be usedexcept
except for private residential purposes&quot;.      It oould not,  therefore, be used even for University purposes without the approval of tho Bedford Estate,4.    Tho Senate have not,  I understand, taken any stops to raise the necessary funds for the new buildings, by public subscription or other;iso, and in June last, as the Government were unable to do more than contributo  370,000  (tho value of the present site and building of Kingis College) towards the cost of re-housing King&apos;s College on the Bloomsbury site, the University declined the offer of the aite,  thus leaving it open to the Government to surrender it.5.    Soni-of f Icial-..-no0otiation-s? have been carried on betweon the Treasury and the University since June last in order to ascertain the views of the University, but no definite decision has been reached, and it has now &quot;become necessary to deoide what action shall be taken, having regard to the provisions in the Conveyanoe,6.   After careful consideration, your Committee decided on the Ilth instant that the Treasury should offer the site to the Bedford Estate in accordance with tho terms of the Conveyance of  1921*  and that simultaneously a letter should be sent to the University intimating that this had been done,7.    After that decision was arrived at,  I was approached bySir Gillian Beveridge pressing me not to act until a Committee of the Senate of the University, who meet next week, have been able to consider the natter.      Sir William stated that the University would be able to uso the whole of the site, notwithstanding the faot that King&apos;s College will not be transferred thereB8.    The Cabinet Committee again considered the matter on the 18thinutant, but after full consideration decided to adhere to their original decision.      They felt that in the absence of any scheme forthe development of the site,  or of any evidence that the necessary funds would bo forthcoming,  arid in view of the onerous conditionsIin the Conveyance,  it was desirable in the public interest that the site should now be offered back to the Duke.      There is also thedanger
danger that if no action were taken, the site would remain on the hands of the Government ami that tho University authorities night, owing to the restrictive covenants of the Conveyance,  endeavour to use tho non-dovolopiaent of tho site for University purposes as a lever for obtaining more assistance than successive Governments have beon prepared to give towards the re-housing of the University, and its various colleges and institutions.20-S.
