I This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;Printed for the Cabinet.    April 1926.r-&apos; p n D 00SECRET. Copy No.    30CP. 154 (26).CABINET.THE LANE PICTURES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN April 1925 Mr. Ormsby Gore circulated to the Cabinet (CP. 203 (25)) on my behalf the Report of the Committee appointed by my predecessor to enquire into certain questions relating to the bequest by the late Sir Hugh Lane of thirty-nine pictures to the National Gallery, London. For convenience of reference a copy of this Report is annexed (Appendix I).At their meeting on the 29th April, 1925, the Cabinet decided (Conclusions 23 (25) (8)) :-(a.) That it would be desirable eventually to lay the Report of the Committee before Parliament.(b.) That in the first instance the Secretary of State for the Colonies should send a copy of the Report confidentially to Mr. Cosgrave, the President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, informing him that it was proposed to publish the Report, and asking his views as to the date of publication.(c.) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should also forward a copy of the Committee&apos;s Report confidentially to the Trustees of the National Gallery and should ascertain their attitude towards the Committee&apos;s proposals.2. In accordance with these decisions I sent a copy of the Report to Mr. Cosgrave on the 14th May, 1925, and on the same date a copy was sent to the Trustees of the National Gallery, asking for their observations on the Report and in particular on paragraph 13 thereof. (This is the paragraph which suggests that the best hope of reaching an amicable settlement lies on the lines of a favourable response by the Trustees to any request for the loan of some of the thirty-nine pictures which might reach them from the authorities of the Galleries in Dublin. The paragraph further points out that under existing legislation the Trustees have no power to lend pictures acquired by gift or bequest until fifteen, or in certain cases twenty-five, years from the date on which they came into the possession of the Gallery, and suggests a short amending Act of Parliament to deal with this point.)3. On the 10th June, 1925, the Trustees of the National Gallery replied that &quot;in vieAv of the many complicated issues which any change in their existing powers of loan must necessarily involve, and which they are still exploring, the Trustees do not think it advisable to apply for special legislation to amend the National Gallery Loan Act at the present time, but the principle of loan to Dublin, which they have favourably considered from the first, will not thereby be affected, although its operation may be a little delayed.&quot;4. Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s answer was delayed, as he explained, by the preoccupation of Dr. McNeill, the Minister particularly concerned with the work of the Boundary Commission, of which he was a member. I finally received his considered reply in November last, and a copy of it is annexed to this Memorandum (Appendix II).5. Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s reply adopts, it will be seen, a somewhat extreme standpoint and casts an unmerited reflection upon the competence and judgment of the Committee. In suggesting doubt as to the legal title of the National Gallery to the pictures under the terms of the Will, he has evidently overlooked the order of the High Court of the 25th May, 1917, which directed the executors of the Will [14431] b
to deliver over the thirty-nine pictures to the Trustees of the National Gallery. He has also made no reference to the finding of the Committee as to Lane&apos;s state of mind after the signature of the codicil of the 3rd February, 1915. But, whatever may be the defects in his presentation of the case, I think that it may be assumed with certainty that his attitude towards the Report will be that of the general public in Ireland when the Report is published. The point (and it is a strong point) which will be seized upon is the finding of the Committee that Lane in signing the codicil thought that he was making a legal disposition. This will be held to substantiate the claim of Dublin to be the place where the pictures should be shown. The other findings and the final recommendation of the Committee will be ignored and we shall be faced with an insistent demand (which will not be confined to the Irish Free State, for I understand that Lord Carson and Sir James Craig will support the Irish Free State in the matter) that the pictures shall be restored to Dublin in accordance with what the Committee found to be Lane&apos;s intention when he signed the codicil.6.   The courses open to us appear to be the following :  (a.) We can introduce legislation (with or without the consent of the Trustees of the National Gallery but presumably their consent would not be forthcoming) transferring the property in the pictures to the City of Dublin, subject to the provision of a suitable building within five years of the date of the Act.(b.) We can ask the Trustees to undertake, subject to any necessary enabling legislation being passed, that they will lend the whole or part of the thirty-nine pictures permanently or temporarily to Dublin as soon as a suitable building has been provided for them.(c.) We can do nothing, i.e., leave it to the Trustees to act as they see fit, bearing in mind (i) that they have already stated in their letter of the 10th June last, referred to in paragraph 3 above, that they have from the first favourably considered the principle of loan to Dublin, but (ii) that in a letter to Mr. Marsh of the 12th May, 1924, Lord Curzon, referring to a previous promise (in 1916) that the Trustees, if so empowered, would respond favourably to a request for the loan of some of the pictures, stated that &quot; at no time was there a question of lending the entire collection still less of alienating it permanently from the National Gallery.&quot;7. As regards (a), if the Trustees were willing to transfer their property in the pictures to Dublin and would consent to legislation empowering them to do so, this would undoubtedly be the simplest course. But I have no reason to suppose that the Trustees would be willing to transfer the property, and, in the absence of their consent, it is obvious that such legislation would be difficult to pass through Parliament, and would, on its merits, be open to strong objection. I might add, however, in this connection that Lord Carson is willing himself to introduce a Bill to that effect.8. On the other hand, I do not think we can follow course (c) and do nothing. The finding of the Committee as to Lane&apos;s intention at the moment of making the codicil, strongly qualified though it is by the view expressed as to his subsequent state of mind and by the finding that it would be improper to modify the will by Act of Parliament, justify, in my opinion, the Irish demand that the British Government should themselves take the matter in hand.9. We are, therefore, left with (&amp;). It depends upon the Trustees which of the various alternatives under this head can be adopted. Before the Committee was appointed, Mr. Cosgrave suggested that the collection should be handed over to Dublin by way of a permanent loan. All kinds of more or less satisfactory variants of a complete and permanent loan are, of course, possible, e.g., that one-half of the collection should be lent at a time, so that not less than twenty of the pictures were always on view in Dublin; or that there should always be thirty-nine pictures on loan to Dublin from the National Gallery, the first thirty-nine so to be lent being the Lane pictures, &amp;c, &amp;c. But my own view is that the most generous of the various alternatives would, if practicable, be the best, and I should therefore like to see the Trustees undertake at once that, subject to any necessary enabling legislation being-passed, they would lend permanently the whole of the thirty-nine pictures to Dublin as soon as a Gallery was provided.10. As to the necessity of enabling legislation, this would depend on the relation of the date when the Gallery in Dublin would be ready to the date when the Trustees would be in a position under the existing law to lend the pictures.
11. I would suggest that I should be authorised by my colleagues to discuss the matter with the Trustees of the National Gallery on the understanding that we feel bound to take some steps to ensure to Dublin the benefit of the pictures, but that we do not propose,- unless with the consent of the Trustees, to introduce legislation transferring the property in the pictures to the City of Dublin. Within those limits I should endeavour to persuade the Trustees to make the most generous offer possible.12. I would only say in conclusion that it is very desirable that the Government should be in a position to make a statement before the new Duveen addition to the Tate Gallery is opened by the King in June.L. S. A.Dominions Office, April 12, 1926.APPENDIX I.To the Right Hon. L. S. Amery, M.P.,Secretary of State for the Colonies.Sir,1. We were appointed by your predecessor, the Right Hon. J. H Thomas, M.P.,. in pursuance of a CabinetTdecision of the 9th July, 1924, as a Committee to consider certain questions relating to the thirty-nine pictures bequeathed under the Will of the late Sir Hugh Lane to the National Gallery in London. The terms of our reference were as follows :  To consider the arguments advanced by the Irish Free State and the Trustees of the National Gallery in London, and to report whether, in our opinion (i.) Sir Hugh Lane, when he signed the codicil of the 3rd February, 1915.thought that he was making a legal disposition, (ii.) If so, whether it is proper that, in view of the international character of the matter at issue, the legal defect in the codicil should be remedied by legislation.2. Written statements have been submitted to us by the Trustees of the London National Gallery and the Dublin Corporation, and we have had the additional advantage of oral testimony by representatives of each of those bodies, and of other parties interested. We have, indeed, received every assistance from all concerned in the dispute. After full consideration of all the evidence laid before us. we have the honour to submit our Report.3. The following chronological outline briefly summarises the main facts of the case which are beyond dispute :-The late Sir Hugh Lane, an Irishman by birth, and an expert in art matters, founded in 1907 a Gallery of Modern Painting in Dublin, some of the pictures being presented by himself, and others by those whose interest in the project he aroused.In July 1913 Lane informed the Director of the National Gallery, London, in a letter that, as the Dublin Corporation were reluctant to carry out his conditions as to building a permanent Gallery to house the Collection, he had decided to offer as a temporary loan to the National Gallery a group of thirty-nine pictures which at that time were on exhibition in Dublin. In August 1913 this offer was accepted; and at the end of September 1913 Lane, withdrew the thirty-nine pictures from Dublin and deposited them with the London National Gallery.On the 3rd October, 1913, Lane executed a Will, bequeathing the thirty-nine pictures to the London National Gallery, &quot; to found a collection of modern continental art in London.&quot; The relevant portion of the will is appended to this Report (Appendix (A))&apos;.In March 1914 Lane was appointed Director of the Dublin NationaL Gallery.Early in 1915 he contemplated making an immediate journey to the United States.  On the 3rd February, 1915, he drew up and signed a codicil to his will, bequeathing the thirty-nine&quot; pictures to the City of Dublin., The text of this codicil will be found in Appendix (B^.   His signature was not witnessed. [14431] \ b 2
Lane&apos;s departure for the United States was unexpectedly delayed, and he did not sail until the 8th April. On the 7th May he was drowned when returning on board the &quot; Lusitania.&quot;4. Of the two questions addressed to us, we have found that the former presents the greater difficulty in arriving at an unqualified and unanimous reply. To answer it has involved us in the endeavour to reconstruct the mind and thoughts of a man long since dead, on a particular occasion nearly ten years ago, with no material for our guidance beyond the imperfect and not infrequently contradictory record of his words and actions during the period immediately adjacent to the date in question.5. We have inspected the original of the Codicil, and the envelope in which it was enclosed by Lane. It is carefully written in ink on a double sheet of the official notepaper of the National Gallery of Ireland. A correction in the date at the head of the document bears the marginal authentication &quot;H. Lane.&quot; The envelope was securely fastened, and addressed (in Lane&apos;s writing) to his sister, who was his confidante in matters of personal business, and the Custodian of his Will. The document was deposited in the drawer of the desk which Lane used as Director of the Dublin National Gallery.6. The unusual care with which Lane drew up the Codicil, and the precautions he took to ensure its falling into the right hands in the event of his decease, leave little room for doubt that it was no mere draft or memorandum for his own use, but a document to which at the time of signature he attached the greatest importance. The fact that he appears to have mentioned its existence to no one disposes of the conjecture that his object in drawing it up was merely to satisfy the wishes of his Irish friends and relatives. His omission to secure witnesses to his signature is in no way inconsistent with the general impression which we have formed of his mental habits and temperament; and in this connection we would draw attention to the statement made to us by his sister that, although on the occasion of his making an earlier will she had explained to him the need for witnesses, he had proposed to sign the will of the 3rd October, 1913 (which she had written out for him), without witnesses, and had again to be reminded of the necessity.7. In the absence of any conceivable alternative purpose for which Lane might have intended the document to which he attached such importance, we are led to the conclusion that at the time of signature he thought he was making a legal disposi-tion, which should take effect in the event of his not returning alive from the dangerous voyage which he had immediately in contemplation. The reply, therefore, to the first part of our enquiry &quot;is in the affirmative; we shall discuss later the degree of relevance borne by this conclusion to our recommendation under the second head.8. The views of your Committee on this subject, however, are not unanimous. One of our number desires it to be placed on record that he feels unable to associate himself with the unqualified reply of his colleagues, as expressed in the two preceding paragraphs.9. Our observations on the second of the questions referred to us may eon-veniently be divided into three parts. We shall first consider the strictly legal aspect of the question, and formulate our view as to the relation of the problem to the law and practice regarding testamentary dispositions in general. Next, we shall discuss the extent to which legalisation of the codicil would in fact be in accordance with the spirit of Lane&apos;s intentions, in so far as we have been able to divine them. Finally, we propose to deal with the question from the more general point of view, bearing in mind that it has been referred to us as a matter of international character.10. No case has been brought to our notice, nor have our own enquiries revealed an example, in which a legal defect in a will or codicil has been removed by a public Act of Parliament in the public interest in order to give effect to. what is alleged to have been the true intention of the Testator. It is a salutary and long-recognised principle that, in giving effect to the wishes of the dead, regard should be paid only to the legal expression of those wishes, and that evidence of contrary intention, either dependent upon extraneous testimony or recorded in a manner not recognised by law should be allowed no credence. Validation by Act of Parliament of Lane&apos;s imperfect codicil would, we are advised, constitute a legal precedent of first importance; and recourse to such a step would,be justified only in the presence of an overwhelmingly strong case on grounds of general public interest. .The principle is generally admitted that it is inequitable so to redress a moral wrong as to impair a moral right. It has been represented to us that, even though it should be conceded that the Dublin Corporation has a moral claim to the pictures denied to them by a legal flaw, yet now to make good that flaw would amount to
inflicting upon the London National Gallery an injury comparable with that which it is sought to alleviate. Not only has the London Gallery the legal possession of the pictures, but on the assurance that such possession would be in perpetuity it has secured the gift of a Gallery in which the pictures are to be housed. To &quot;stultify the assurance on the strength of which the gift was offered would be a breach of&apos; faith with the donor.11. We have expressed the view, held by the majority of our number, that at the moment of signing the codicil, Lane thought he was making a legal disposition: or, in other words, that on the 3rd February, 1915, it was Lane&apos;s definite intention that, in the event of his death during his absence from Europe, the thirty-nine pictures should take their place with the rest of his collection in Dublin. We propose-now to review, briefly, our reasons for considering that to give effect to that intention by Act of Parliament would be contrary to the spirit and purport of Lane&apos;s wishes, as expressed during the last two years of his life, in regard to the ultimate destina-tion of his bequest.Nothing stands out more clearly from the record of Lane&apos;s acts and conversations during the years 1913-15 than the instability of his attitude towards the rival claims of the Dublin and the London Gallery. The friction in which he found himself unfortunately involved with the authorities of either institution in turn bent his thoughts now to London, now to Dublin, as the possible recipient of his gift. A mood of annoyance with the one or the other caused him to vacillate with a frequency and suddenness which appear remarkable, until it is realised that underlying the rapid and impulsive changes of his attitude there was one steady purpose ever present to his mind.The establishment, under worthy conditions, of a Gallery of Modern Continental Painting, ultimately perhaps to be comparable with the great modern galleries of the capitals of Europe, was the goal to which Lane&apos;s activities seem constantly to have been directed. Whether this Gallery should be in Dublin or in London was, in our view, a matter to which he was relatively indifferent; a hint that either city was in a position to provide a building commensurate with his idea seemed enough to turn his mind in its favour. In his conversations he was careful to avoid any commit -ment so definite as to hamper his future discretion; even during the period between the signature of the codicil and his departure for America we find that he expressed himself in contrary senses to the one party and the other, making it clear to the dispassionate observer that not until he was finally assured of the prospect of a Gallery did he intend to commit himself irrevocably. The thirty-nine pictures were, in fact, a makeweight which he cast first into one scale, then into the other, according as the indications pointed to London, or to Dublin, as the sphere of realisation of his cherished ideal.Turning now to consider the developments of the last ten years, we find that whereas in Dublin no practical steps have been taken to advance the fulfilment of Lane&apos;s desires, in London there exists, thanks to the munificence of a private benefactor, a Gallery, rapidly approaching completion, destined to serve the very object which Lane had in view. Had he been spared to witness the growth of the new Gallery at Millbank, no doubt can be entertained that he would have destroyed the codicil, and would have been content that the pictures to which he attached so much value would form the nucleus of a representative collection of Modern Continental Art.The plea that effect should be given, by means which we are advised are extra-ordinary and unprecedented, to the momentary wishes of a man, who, if still alive, would probably have been the first to deplore the result, is one which we cannot endorse.12. In our terms of reference we were invited to have particular regard to &quot;the international character of the matter in issue.&quot; We submit, however, that there is nothing in the circumstances attending the subject of our enquiry which justifies its being raised to the status of a bone of contention between nations. The parties directly interested in the controversy are, on the one hand, the municipal authorities of a city, and, on the other, the Board of Trustees of an institution which, though National in name, is in fact more of the nature of a semi-public corporation than of a Department of State.13. We are informed that in December 1916 the Trustees of the National Gallery intimated to the representatives of the Dublin Corporation their conditional readiness to respond favourably to any request for the loan of some of the thirty-nine pictures which might reach them from the authorities of the Galleries in Dublin. This offer was repeated in March 1918. We venture so far to depart from the strict [14431] b 3
Appendix (A).This is the Last Will and Testament of me, Hugh Percy Lane, Knt., of Lindsey House 100 Cheyne Walk Chelsea in the County of Middlesex. I hereby revoke all Wills heretofore made by me..... (Sundry personal bequests) ....I bequeath my Sargent portrait to the Dublin National Gallery. I bequeath my Sargent portrait, the modern pictures now being shown in Belfast and any modern pictures of merit (John drawings, etc.) that I possess to the Dublin Gallery of Modern Art, other than the group of pictures lent by me to the London National Gallery, which I bequeath to found a collection of Modern Continental Art in London.I bequeath the remainder of my property to the National Gallery of Ireland (instead of to the Dublin Modern Art Gallery, which I considered so important for the founding of an Irish School of painting), to be invested and the income to be spent on buying pictures of deceased painters of established merit. I hope that this alteration from the Modern Gallery to the National Gallery will be remembered by the Dublin Municipality and others as an example of its want of public spirit in the year 1913 and for the folly of such bodies assuming to decide on questions of Art instead of relying on expert opinion.In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 11th day of October, one thousand nine hundred and thirteen.Testator&apos;s signature :Hugh Percy Lane.Signed and Declared by the above-named Testator as and for his last Will in the presence of us present at the same time, who at his request and in his presence and in the presence of each other have hereunto affixed our names as witnesses.Name: Prank Loftus. Address : 100, Cheyne Walk. Occupation : Butler.Name: Cicely Loftus. Address : 100, Cheyne Walk. Occupation : Housekeeper.terms of our reference as to suggest that on lines such as these lies the best hope of reaching an amicable settlement of this long-drawn controversy.By the National Gallery (Loan) Act of 1883 the Trustees are empowered to lend pictures under their control to any public gallery authorised by the Act. We are advised that the inclusion of Section 5 of this Act in the Schedule to the Irish Free State (Consequential Adaptation of Enactments) Order in Council, 1923, preserves the right of the Municipal Gallery in Dublin to be regarded as an authorised Gallery for this purpose.It is provided, however, by another section ($ 4) of the Act that pictures acquired by gift or bequest shall not be so lent until the expiration of fifteen, or in certain cases, twenty-five, years from the date on which they came into possession of the Gallery, and this condition appears effectually to bar any proposal for an early loan of a portion of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s pictures to the Dublin Gallery. We suggest that a short Act of Parliament might be passed amending this section of the Act of 1883.14. To sum up, we find (subject to the reservation in paragraph 8)- (a) that Sir Hugh Lane, in signing the codicil of the 3rd February, 1915, thought he was making a legal disposition.(i) that nevertheless it would not be proper to modify Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s Will by public Act of Parliament. To do so would, in addition to constituting a legal precedent of the utmost gravity, not justified by the facts, have the effect of bringing about a result contrary to the real spirit of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s intentions. Our reply to the second question is therefore in the negative.15. We have been much assisted by our Secretary, Mr. L. B. Freeston (Colonial Office), in the course of our enquiry, both in keeping the records of our various meetings (without the aid of a shorthand-writer) and in the drafting of this Report, and we desire to record our high appreciation of these services.J.

The croup of pictures I have lent to Belfast I give to the Municipal Gallery in Harcourt Street. If a building is provided withm five years the whole collection will be housed together. The sole Trustee in this question is to be my Aunt, Lady Gregory. She is to appoint any additional trustees she may think fit.I also wish that the pictures now on loan at this (National Gallery of Ireland) Gallery remain as my gift.&apos; (Sd) Hugh Lane.I would like my friend Tom Bodkin to be asked to help in the obtaining of this new Gallery for Modern Art for Dublin. If within five years a Gallery is not forthcoming, then the group of pictures (at the London National Gallery) are to be sold and the proceeds go to fulfil the purpose of my Will.(Sd) Hugh Lane.February 3. 1915.APPENDIX II.The Eight Hon. L. S. Amery, M.P., Roinn an UactarainSecretary of State for the Dominions, Srdid Muirbtean VacDowning Street, London. Baile dta Cliat (Dublin),Dear Mr. Amery, November 4, 1925.1. I am very sorry for the delay which has occurred in giving you our views upon the report of the Committee set iip to consider the question of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s pictures, but the matter is of such importance that I felt bound to afford my colleagues ample opportunity of examining it in detail before replying. The pressure of Parliamentary business towards the end of the Summer and the absence of various Ministers during the past three months rendered it impossible for us to give the subject the requisite consideration until now.2.   The two questions referred to the Committee were : (a.) Whether in their opinion Sir Hugh Lane, when he signed the codicil of the 3rd February, 1915, thought that he was making a legal disposition.(b.) If so, whether in their opinion it is proper that, in view of the international character of the matter at issue, the legal defect in the codicil should be remedied by legislation.3. The first of these questions, which is a question of fact, the Committee have answered in the affirmative; and, in view of the circumstances set out in para-graphs 5, 6 and 7 of their report, it is difficult to see how they could have arrived at any other conclusion.4. The finding of the Committee on the second question is less satisfactory, and is, in our opinion, open to very grave criticism. Having found as a fact that Sir Hugh Lane, when he signed the codicil of the 3rd February, 1915, believed that he was making a legal disposition, they were asked whether it was proper, in view of the international character of the matter at issue, that the legal defect in the codicil should be remedied by legislation. The Committee have, however, taken upon themselves to disregard the instruction to consider the propriety of legislation from the point of view of the international character of the question involved, and instead to consider the propriety of legislation as if the matter at issue were one between &quot;the municipal authorities of a City &quot; and &quot; the Board of Trustees of an institution which, though National in name, is in fact more of the nature of a semi-public corporation than of a Department of State &quot; (paragraph 12 of report). The result of this has been that the Committee have, failed to consider and report on the propriety of legislation for the purpose of remedying the defect in the codicil from the only point of view from which they were asked to consider it.5. It is quite unnecessary for me to labour the international aspect of the matter at issue. This has long since been conceded. But I may perhaps point out that the Committee have allowed themselves to fall into a serious error when they observe (paragraph 10) that to make good the legal flaw in the codicil &quot;would amount to
inflicting upon the London National Gallery an injury comparable with that which it is sought to alleviate,&apos;&apos; a statement which they support by remarking that the London Gallery has the &quot; legal possession of the pictures &quot; at the moment. The will of the 11th October, 1913, does not bequeath the pictures to the London Gallery. The pictures are therein bequeathed &apos;1 to f ound a collect ion of Modern Continental Art in. London,&quot; and the reference to the London National Gallery is by way of identification of the group of pictures so disposed of. It is quite true that in the codicil Sir Hugh Lane refers to these pictures as having been bequeathed in the Will to that institution, but, as the codicil is not a valid legal instrument, this reference cannot effect the bequest.6. The Committee, in reply to the second question addressed to them, have found that &quot; it would not be proper to modify Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s Will by public Act of Parliament,&quot; but the steps by which they purport to have reached this conclusion are open to grave comment. They deal in the first place with the strictly legal aspect of the question and formulate their views as to the relation of the problem to the Law and practice regarding testamentary dispositions in general, and they state that they are advised that &quot; the validation by Act of Parliament of Lane&apos;s imperfect codicil would constitute a legal precedent of the first importance, and that recourse to such a step would be justified only in the presence of an overwhelmingly strong case on the grounds of general public interest.&quot; It may be that the validation by public Act of Parliament of an imperfect testamentary document is without actual precedent. But the alteration of the dispositions in the will of a Testator by public Act of Parliament is not without precedent and it is difficult to conceive a more overwhelmingly strong case on the ground of general public interest than the present one. No private interest is involved; and no private right is interfered with. It is purely a question between two nations; and this could not have been more clearly recognised and emphasised than in the direction to the Committee to consider the question of giving effect by legislation to the invalid codicil (i.e., of altering the dispositions of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s Will) in view of the international aspect of the question.7. The report deals next with what the Committee considered to be the moral aspect of the case, and argues that, even if the moral claim of the Corporation of Dublin to the pictures be conceded, legislation making good that claim would be a breach of faith with the donor of the Gallery of Modern Continental Painting now being erected at Millbank. This argument depends for its validity on the assumption that the donor of this Gallery was induced to make his gift by an assurance that the Lane pictures would be permanently housed there. But it is difficult to conceive how any such assurance could have been given, or if given could have been acted upon.8. Before the end of May 1915, the month in which Sir Hugh Lane died, his aunt, Lady Gregory, as I am informed, took a copy of the codicil to the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the National Gallery (Lord Curzon), who wrote to her on the 1st June, 1915, that he had brought it before the Board. There was considerable delay in proving Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s Will, but in October 1916, in answer to a letter from Lady Gregory, Lord Curzon wrote : &quot; The matter is not in my hands, nor, at this moment, even in the hands of the Board. They are waiting to be advised by their legal advisers, and, in the interim, it would not be right for any individual Trustee to intervene.&quot; It is obvious, therefore, that at that time (October 1916) no promise had been made or undertaking given by or on behalf of the Trustees of the National Gallery to Sir Joseph Duveen with reference to the pictures.9. Almost immediately after the above-mentioned letter of Lord Curzon, written in October 1916, a correspondence began in the &quot;Times,&quot; the &quot;Morning Post,&quot; the &quot; Observer,&quot; and other leading London newspapers, in which the claim of the Corporation of Dublin to&apos; the Lane pictures was formulated, and the question of its recognition by Parliament was raised. At no time since then has the claim ceased to be pressed.10. In addition to lengthy correspondence in the public press, petitions for the return of the pictures to Ireland were sent to the Trustees of the National Gallery by the Corporation of Dublin, by artists who had contributed pictures to the modern gallery (municipal) in Dublin where the pictures were originally housed, and by representatives of the Learned Societies of Dublin. In 1918 a public meeting was held in the Mansion House, Dublin, in support of the claim of the Corporation of Dublin to the pictures, which was attended by representative men from all parts of Ireland.   And in 1919 a Bill was, I understand, drafted at the instance
of Mr. Ian MaePherson, then Chief Secretary for Ireland, for the purpose of making valid the unsigned Codicil.11. It seems incredible therefore that Sir Joseph Duveen should have been ignorant of the Claim of the Corporation of Dublin to the pictures and of the constantly-pressed demand for the necessary legislation to make good that claim, or that the Trustees of the National Gallery should have given to Sir Joseph Duveen, as an inducement for the erection of the Gallery of Modern Continental Painting at Millbank, an undertaking that they would hand over the pictures to that gallery. I may add that the building of the new Gallery at Millbank was not commenced until 1923,and that it was announced in the press that it was &quot; given by Sir Joseph Duveen to the British Nation as a thanksgiving for Peace.&quot;12. I turn now to the concluding paragraphs of the report in which the Committee, having expressed the view of the majority of their number that when he signed the codicil, Lane thought he was making a legal disposition, and that it was his definite intention on the 3rd February, 1915, that, in the event of his death during his absence from Europe, the pictures should take their place with the rest of his collection in Dublin, give as their reason for not recommending legislation to give effect to that intention, that to do so would be contrary to the spirit and purport of his wishes as expressed during the last two years of his life. In dealing with this portion of the Report, it may be conceded that, during the last two years of his life and up to the date on which he signed the codicil, Lane&apos;s great desire was the establishment, under worthy conditions, of a Modern Gallery of Continental Painting, and that the likelihood of the provision of a suitable building in Dublin or London exercised a certain influence on his intention for the time being as to the destination of the pictures. But while conceding this, it must be remembered that Lane&apos;s original intention was the establishment in Dublin of this much-desired collection of Modern Painting, of which these pictures were to form the nucleus, and above all that, on the eve of his departure on a journey from which he did not expect to return, he executed a solemn document by which he believed that he had secured the pictures for Dublin in case he did not return. It would seem therefore that it is only by doing violence to the last wishes of Lane as to the destination of the pictures in the event which has happened, that legislation to validate the codicil can be refused.13. I note that in coming to the conclusion that they cannot recommend legislation, the Committee has been influenced by &quot;the developments of the last ten years,&quot; in the matter of the provision of a suitable gallery for these pictures, and that they contrast the inaction of the Corporation of Dublin with the steps taken in advance by the donor of the gallery at Millbank. This contrast, however, is a most unjust one. Until the destination of the pictures should be finally settled, the Corporation of Dublin would not have been justified in proceeding with the erection of a gallery to house them, but they indicated in the clearest possible manner their determination to provide a suitable gallery once the pictures were secured to Dublin.   On the 6th November, 1916, they passed the following resolution :  &quot;That this Corporation respectfully requests the Trustees of the National Gallery, London, to co-operate with them in taking steps to give effect to the last wishes of Sir Hugh Lane as expressed in the codicil of his Will, written out and signed by him shortly before his death, that the group of pictures lent by him to the London National Gallery should be handed over to the Dublin Municipal Gallery of Modern Art.&quot;Two years later on the 2nd September, 1918, the Corporation reaffirmed its decision to provide a new gallery for the housing of the pictures, a decision to which the present Commissioners have expressed their willingness to give effect.14. I have gone at some length into these matters, because the question of the destination of the Lane pictures is not merely one between two picture galleries, and because I feel strongly that the Committee in deciding to treat it as such have failed to realise its importance and have allowed their judgment to be based upon considerations which are not alone outside their terms of reference, but are in themselves unsound and inapplicable. I may add that the matter has aroused deep interest and feeling in Ireland, and that legislation which would secure the pictures for Dublin would be welcomed as an act of generosity as well as of justice and would have a happy effect on the relations between the two countries.Yours sincerely, (Signed) W.
