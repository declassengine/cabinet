9 * Hir^vTtnmTTTfi THE PROPERTY OP HIS 3PJ.TAHIIIC MAJESTY ? S GQ^RKMBNT )Copy No.   ^    Q: 181 (26)CAB I N S ToPROVISION OF pAXS TO CHILBRMN BY LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES. MEMORANDUM by the PRESIDENT of the BOARD OP ISPUCATION.1,     I annex a Memorandum as to the powers of local Education Authorities in regard     to the feeding of school children, and the history of the action taken by Authorities and by the Government in this matter in the periods of the coal stoppages in 1912-13 and 1921-22, and in the first few months of the War.2.     Questions are already being addressed to roe by certain Local Education Authorities as to the procedure which should be followed by them in the event of a coal stoppage next month;    and I desire to obtain the approval of the Cabinet to the course which I propose to follow.3.     At the present moment I should not propose to issue any general pronouncement restricting the operations of Local Education Authorities.   Such a pronouncement would embitter the feelings of the persons affected by the stoppage, whether they were coalminers or other persons directly or indirectly affected, and might also accentuate the difficulties of the situation by cutting off one of the agencies for providing necessitous children with food. On the other hand, the experience of 1921-22 indicates that, in the absence of any restrictions, the cost of the provision of meals by Local Education Authorities may result in a very startling increase of the charges upon the Exchequer which will have to be met out of the Board&apos;s Vote;   and
there is, of course, the risk of an abuse of the-ir powers by certain Local Authorities who may be tempted to extend the provision of meals to children whr* are not in factnecessitous, or to use such provision as one of the meansof prolonging the stoppago.4t     Igy view is that administrative action directed to individual Local Authorities and concentrated upon those Authorities who appear to be exceeding or abusingtheir powers is to be preferred to the issue of any generalCirculars,   ^Department are already receiving weeklyreturns shuwirig the areas in which feeding has taken place.the number of children fed, and the number of mealsprovided, &apos; These returns, supplemented by reports from theBoard&apos;a Inspectors on the spot, will enable me to keep inclose touch with the proceedings of all Local authorities who are undertaking the provision of meals;   and wherever Itappeared to me that such action was &quot;necessary, I should propose, as a condition of grant, to insist strictly upon -(a) the proper selection of children, with a :, view to the elimination of those who are notin fact necessitous;(b ) adequate co-operation with the Guardians, andother relief agencies, including arrangements for the recovery of the cost which should I properly be borne by such agencies;.I (c) the elimination of any excessive expenditure.5.     At present I think Authorities generally, including those under the control of the Labour Party, are administeringthis service reasonably and the increased expenditure upon it last year seems approximately what might have been expected in view of the exceptional distress in certain areas such as Durham^    In these circumstances the action
I propose will I hope bo sufficient for the moment to keep expenditure within reasonable limits, &quot;but if. the stoppage is prolonged and includes other industries I am afraid that proper discrimination will soon become almost impossible In practioe and the experienc-o of 1921 may well be repeated.13.P.30th April 1926.
1. Section 84 of the Education Act, 1921 providesthat &quot;where the Local Education Authority resolve that any of the children attending an elementary school within their area are unable by reason of lack of food to take full advantage of the education provided for them, and have ascertained that funds other than public fundB are not available or are insufficient in amount to   defray the oost of food furnished in meals under this Act, they may spend out of the rates such, sum as will meet the cost of the provision of such food&quot;.Other Sections empower the Authority to assist a voluntary committee in providing meals and require the Authority to charge to the parent in respect of every meal furnished, such an amount as may be determined by the Authority unless they are satisfied that the parent is unable by reason of circumstances other than his own default to pay the amount.The Sections referred to of the Education Act, 1921 reproduce the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts of 1905 and 1914.       It will be noted that there is no obligation on the Local Education Authority to provide meals.2e        Grant is payable by the Board at the rate of 50 per cent on the expenditure incurred by Local-Education Authorities on provision of meals as part of the general grant for elementary education.   The relevant regulations of the Board require inter alia that the ohildren admitted to the meals must be properly selected.
3, The expenditure by Local Education authorities on this service rose from  123.386 in 1909-10 to  153,433 in 1919-20, leaving  out    of account two abnormal years.     In 1912-13 when there was a ooal stoppage the expenditure rose to  184,570 and in 1914-15 when, on the outbreak of war, there was for a&quot; Bhoxt time a certain amount of panic feeding to  298,238.    In 1920-21 whioh was the beginning of the period of industrial depression the expenditure was  251,751.     Throughout this period the number of Education Authorities providing meals was about 130*4.        1921-22 was the year of the great coal strike which brought about an entirely new situation.     Acute distress was occasioned in the coal mining areas and many Authorities provided meals on an altogether unprecedented scale.    The number of Authorities providing meals increased to 190 and included all Authorities in whose areas coal mining was the predominant industry. Luring the week ended 7th May 1921, 1% million meals were supplied to 182,000 children in these areas.   The normal routine for the selection of children was inevitably abandoned and it was assumed that   all strikers&apos; children needed meals.     Probably a certain number of meals-were     -provided for children who were not in need of them;,   but substantially it may be said that decent food was provided in satisfactory ways for the children who needed it.     The total net expenditure during this year was  945, 627.5e        At the beginning of 1922-23 the scope of feeding had not returned to the normal and on the
4th April 1922 Mr. ffisher announced in reply to a question in the House of Commons that the Government had decided that it was impossible to acquiesce in a continuance of the arrangement under which in abnormal periods a considerable part of the burden of poor relief could be thrown upon the education rate and the vote of the Board of Education.     In 1921-22 expenditure had been incurred by -Education Authorities for the provision of meals on a scale which he was sure was outside the scope of the Provision of Meals Acts as Parliament intended them to operate.     While he appreciated the oare and humanity with which Education Authorities had met the emergenoy, the financial and administrative burden thrown on the system of education was much greater than it oould or ought to carry.     The Government had accordingly decided that the total expenditure of Education Authorities on this service which the Board would recognise for grant would be limited to  300,000 in 1922-23.     He assumed that every endeavour would be made to secure effective co-operation with Poor Law and other Public Authorities.6.    This pronouncement was followed by the issue to Local iilducation Authorities of Circular 1261 whioh laid down the general principles on which, in the Board&apos;b opinion, the Provision of Meals Aots should be administered and gave certain statistics which would enable Authorities to compare their own arrangements with those of other Authorities and the country as a whole.     Each Authority    was asked to submit for the Board&apos;s approval a revised scheme for the administration
of the Prevision of Meal3 Acts and a revised estimate of their expenditure on this service in 1922-23. It was stated that the Board had no doubt that if Education Authorities would in future restriot themselves to providing meals on the lines indicated, leaving to other bodies the relief of temporary or chronic destitution, the sum put at the Board&apos;s disposal by Parliament would enable them to pay a 50$ grant on all expenditure properly incurred.The ration never actually took effect as the expenditure of Education Authorities for 1922-23 foil &apos; to  254,887 and for 1923-24 to  152,432, roughly the same amount as in 1919-20.7.       Mr.Trevelyan on the 14th February, 1924, announced, in reply to a question in the House, that he did not propose to retain a specific limit on the expenditure of Local Education Authorities, stating at the same time that he relied on the Authorities to exercise due economy and care in the administration of this service. He stated in minutes that he was reluctant to make any chang of policy which would restrict the freedom of Local Education Authorities to feed in emergencies such as seriously industrial stoppages,      ,:Eor the present we had better go on encouraging and advising Local Education Authorities to make arrangements for recovering the cost of meals from Guardians but not go to the length of disallowance if they are not finally successful.  H8.     Apart from the ration, a Circular issued by the Board on the 17th May, 1922,(copy attached) stands as the latest public pronouncement of Government policy.     In accordance with this Circular the schemes of all feeding areas were reviewed and made subject to the formal approval.  4.
of the Board.     Such approval was conditional upon the Authority formulating a satisfactory Income scale for determining the admission of children to free meals, and taking measures to co-operate with the Guardians in the feeding of relief cases.     The Board had pointed out in the Circular that even in cases where the Guardians were the proper body to pay for the meals,it would generally be preferable that the meals themselves should be provided by the Education Authority in return for a payment by the Guardians.     In some areas this arrangement was in fact adopted.     Other Authorities including London decided not to feed relief oases.

Circular to Local Education. Authorities.. Ciroular 1261.&quot; ,,,,.1..      a * 17tii      1922*All communications should he addressed to -I The Secretary, . -Medical Department, Board &apos;of Eduoation, 5-6, Clement*s Inn,Strand, W.C.2.BOAR^^OE^^education I .    . EDUCATION  (PROVISION OP MEALS) ACTS,  1906-14.1.   The unprecedented expansion of the number of free meals provided by Local Education Authorities under the Provision of Heals Acta during 1921-22 has&apos; made it neoessary for the Board to consider very carefully the arrangements uaade by Authorities for the administration of these Acts,   A survey of these arrangements reveals so striking a variety both in principle and in practice that it is clear that the Board must ask Authorities as a whole for a systematic reconsideration of the methods and machinery which they have adopted.2,    It seems probable that the- absence of any coherent system of administration in the country as a whole is at least partly due to the fact that Authorities are not fully aware of the nature of the provision made in areas other than their own.   As a first step, therefore, to a more informed and orderly system, the Board think it desirable to put Authorities in possession of the faots.    They propose therefore in this Circular to lay before Authorities the general principles on which, in their opinion the Provision of Meals Acts should be administered and also ouch statistics as will enable Authorities to compare the manner and extent of their own arrangements with those both of the country as a whole and also of other individual Authorities.3.   As regards general principles, the lines which have beer-laid down&apos; for the guidance of the Board and of Authorities generally are stated in a reply which the President of the Board
gave to a question in the House of Commono on 4th April 1922in the following words&quot;The Government have decided that it is impossible to acquiesce in a continuance of the present arrangement, under which, in abnormal periods^ a;considerable part of the burden of poor relief may be thrown upon the education rate and the Vote of the Board of Education.   In the year 1921-22 expenditure has been incurred by Local Education Authorities for the provision of meals on a scale which I am sure is quite outside the soope of the Provision of Meals Aot as Parliament intended it to operate, and though I greatly appreciate the care and humanity with which Local Education Authorities have met the emergency the financial and administrative burden which has been thrown on the system of education is much greater than it can or ought to oarry.   For these reasons the Government have decided that the total expenditure of Local Education Authorities on the provision of school meals which the Board will recognise for the calculation of grant shall be limited to  300,000 in 1922-23 - a&apos;-cum which allows of sufficient margin over previous expenditure in normal years to cover such arrange-ments as may legitimately be made to meet exceptional circumstances in the current financial year.     The Board, of course, assume that every endeavour will be made to secure effective co-operation with Poor Law Authorities and other public Authorities on the lines indicated in the Circular (No.261)  issued by the Ministry of Health on the 23rd November 1921.&quot;4. As regards statistics, the Board have collected the figures which appear to be specially relevant to the present purpose and have added them as Appendices to this Circular.
In Appendix A will be found summaries of the total number of meals provided by Local Education Authorities and of their cost year by year from 1908-9 to 1922-23.   The figures for 1921-22 are only estimates, while the cost for 1922-23 is a summary of the forecasts sent by Authorities to the Board at the beginning of 1922.Appendix B contains a list of all Authorities who have at   &apos; any time put the Provision of Meals acts into operation, with columns showing the relevant facts in connexion with this Service.   The various columns practioally explain themselves, but the , following general observations may be useful.    Column 3 gives for each Authority the largest number of meals ever pro-vided in.any single year, except the three wholly abnormal years viz., 1912-13 (Coal stoppage), 1914-15 (first winter of the War) and 1921-22 (Coal stoppage):    i.e,, the column shows what may be regarded as the high-water mark for each Authority for &quot;normal&quot; years.    Column 5 gives the net expenditure of Authorities for the nine months from the 1st April 1921 to the 31st December 1921, and column 6 shows this expenditure expressed as the average cost for each unit of average attendance in the schools in the area. For convenience of comparison the various types of Authority, Counties, County Boroughs, Boroughs and Urban Districts are given separately with totals and averages for each type, in addition to the totals and averages for the country as a whole.   Special attention is called to these totals in view of the limit of  300,000 referred to in paragraph 3 above.The Board have little     doubt that a study of the figures in this Appendix will be illuminating to many Authorities, and will indicate the need of considering their schemes in the light of what is being done in other areas.   Each Authority will be in a position to select for itself the areas with which it can be most fairly and usefully compared.
Appendix C is a list of Authorities who have never provided meals at any time,5.   The Board feel sure that the striking inequalities revealed by theBe Appendices cannot be explained wholly, or even mainly, by genuine inequalities in the needs of ochool children in different areas.   It may be true that even with a uniform standard of nutrition or necessitousness applied evenly throughfci the country, there would remain areas where the Authority would be justified in providing no meals at all and other areas which would rightly show an expenditure well above the average.  But such considerations clearly do not explain the facts as a whole, When, for instanoe, no leas than 5 County Boroughs, 56 Non-County Boroughs, 30 Counties, and 7 Urban Districts, or 98 area? in all, are found never at any time to have provided any meals at all, while others are found to have provided, during normal times, the numbers shown in Appendix B, it is olear that very wide divergencies of view exist as to the intentions of the Act^ divergencies which go far beyond any legitimate differences of interpretation.    In many areas the local administration, as pointed out by the President of the Board, has had the effect of transferring a considerable part of the burden of poor relisl to the Education Rate, and expenditure has been incurred on the provision of meals on a eveale quite outside the soope of tha Ac as Parliament intended them to operate.   But, even on the assumption that the Acts might properly be used to relieve destitution, looal administration has been hy no means consist^ or uniform.   The standard of necessitousness haB varied within very wide limits, and the Board have reason to believe.-that in many areas children have been admitted to free meals whose faffi circumstances neither necessitated nor Justified suoh an arrangi ment.    In this connexion it is relevant to note that fcoth at
Whitsuntide and at Christmas 1921, there occurred a large and significant drop in the number of children who took advantage of the free provision of meals.   After making all allowances for the assistance given by voluntary funds at Christmas time, the Board are of opinion that the holiday figures at least reinforce the strong suspicion that many children receive meals at the public expense whose parents are not really in need of relief at all,6*    The Board must now ask each Authority to take into oareful consideration the suggestions and information now put at their disposal and to submit for the Board&apos;e approval a revised scheme for the administration&apos;of the Provision of Meals Acts and a revised estimate of their proposed expenditure on this Service in 1922-23,   The Board have no doubt that if Authorities&apos;will in future confine themselves strictly to provid-ing meals on the lines indicated in the Aots, leaving to other bodies the relief     of temporary or chronio destitution., the sum put at the Board&apos;s disposal by Parliament will enable them to pay a 50 per cent grant on all expenditure properly incurred by Authorities,    It must- however, be understood that this limit cannot under any circumstances be exceeded and Authorities therefore will be well advised to let the Board have at the earliest possible opportunity their revised estimate for the coming year.     As soon as the Board have received these estimates from Authorities as a whole, they will inform each Authority whether the amount of their estimate is suoh as can be accepted for purposes of Grant in view of the limit imposed by the Government. The Authority&apos;s arrangements and estimate should, of course, be submitted on Form 9 M, and should, be accompanied by the statement asked for in Section XII .A. of that Pbrm,*     The statement should^Authorities who hare already submitted Forms 9 M, are requestedto furnish the Board with revised particulars under Sections III(A),(E) and (F) of that Form,
make clear the arrangements adopted for co-operation with other local &quot;bodies concerned with measures of relief, especially with the Guardians of the Poor.   In this connection the Board wish to point out that even in cases where the Guardians are the proper &quot;body to pay for the meals, it will generally be preferable that the meals themselves shall be provided by the Authority in return for a payment by the Guardians.   Such an arrangement, which secures that the child actually receives a cheap and wholesoBje meal,  is very desirable, and is quite feasible under a wise system of co-operation.7.    In conclusion, the Board wish to make it clear that while they have been compelled to point out that many Authorities have expanded the scope of the Provision of Meals Aots to an extent which cannot be regarded as permissible, they sympathise with the motives which have led them to act as they have.   They are aware of the valuable and disinterested service given to this work by many Authorities, and by large numbers of their officers and teachers throughout the country, especially in times of national p local emergency and distress.   While taking steps to relieve them of much of the burden of this work for the future, the Board wish to take the opportunity of conveying to them their sincere appreciation of the work they have done in the past.A.
