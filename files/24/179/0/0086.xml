o i0(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPi&amp;TY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.It has occurred to me that it may be useful if I place on record for confidential purposes my recollection of what took place during the private negotiations on Saturday and Sunday between three Ministers and  three representatives of the Trades Unions.My recollection is precise and will,  I believe, not be disputed.We never were on Saturday in reach of any agreement or even of a formula upon which agreement might appear to rest. But the talk was frank and friendly and in view of the gravity of the issues,  we were all unwilling to part with an absolute admission of failureoIn these circumstances the document was produced which was circulated to the Cabinet on Sunday morning.This document was much criticised at the Cabinet on the grounds of vagueness and inoonolusiveness, and especially because it amounted neither to an assurance nor an agreement. It was not meant to do either.    It was meant to be what it purported to be, namely,  a statement of the impression left uponthe mind of the Prime Minister by the observations which fell during the course of a full discussion from the members of the Trades Unions Committee.    They were to return on Sunday,  having consulted their colleagues in order to make it plain whether the recorded impression of the Prime Minister correspondedSECRETG.i. z,.186.(a6,KCOAL NEGOTIATIONS.
with the facts as those facts emerged after consultation with other Trades Unionist leaders,      Equally the Prime Minister reserved to himself the right to consult his colleagues in order to determine whether the words used, if acceptedby the Trades Unionist leaders as a whole would be satisfactory to them.      It may in this connection be made plain that more definite words than &quot;upon the lines of the Report&quot; were neither then nor at any other time attainable. The negotiators neither then nor at any other time would consent to use the expression &quot;accept the Report&quot; simpliciter.On Sunday, after discussions both among the Trades Unionists and at the Cabinet, with which I am not at this moment concerned, the matter was resumed between the confidential negotiators; and as the matter has now been discussed publicly In some at least of its aspects, I ought to make it plain that it was throughout explicitly agreed that the whole of our conversation was non-committal and confidential,,      In fact it was explicitly stated that if our discussions proved fruitless, we should revert to the fighting ground which preceded our private discussions eThe Sunday conversation began by a statement made by Mr. Pugh to the effect that on principle his friends accepted the impressions upon the mind of the Prime Minister recorded in the document already referred to.     But they could not assent to the statement that they were confident a conclusion would be reached.      It would be more accurate to say that they had not formed such an opinion...    In the second place,  they were unable
to make the expression &quot;on the lines of the Report&quot; more definite,      They were still unable to   substitute the phrase &quot;accept the Report&quot;.      And. if the fortnight provisionally allotted to the discussions proved inadequate (and no one seriously argued on behalf of its adequacy) Mr.  Thomas frankly stated that they would expect the Government to provide a subsidy for whatever period was in fact occupied by the negotiations on reorganisation,,      It had by this time become evident that instead of drawing closer together, we were getting further apart.      I informed Mr. Thomas very plainly of the general attitude of the Cabinet as disclosed by our discussion in the morning.      I told him that further negotiations seemed to me to be useless unless the Trades Unionist leaders were prepared, to take the responsibility of  advising the Miners that either in the matter of hours or wages there must be a concession whilst the matter of reorganisation was under adjustment.      In tne conversation that followed he used expressions which indicated that he was going as far as it was In any event possible, then or thereafter, for him and his colleagues to go.      I said,  &quot;Well,  If that is as far as you feel able to go,  It would at least be useful that I should take down your exact words for the consideration of the Cabinet.      I melee it plain that In my judgment there is no chance whatever that an assurance so vague and so limited will be accepted by them;    but you are at least entitled that the words used by you should be placed before them for consideration&quot;.I then took down the words which were recorded in the second document which was explained by
me to the Cabinet on our return.      Neither in tho Saturday discussion nor in the Sunday discussion was any encouragement given cither by myself or by my colleagues to the view that we were within reach of a settlement.      This was oven more true on Sunday than on Saturday, for on Saturday wo wore more hopeful than there was any excuse for being on Sunday that tha words &quot;on the lines of the Haport&quot; might be amended to the words &quot;involving an acceptance of the Report&quot;.-This hops perished on Sunday.      The whole course of discussion on this day mad a it plain that so fax from approaching accommod&amp;tion,wo wore drifting from it. Tha only document which Mr Thomas could have been *a submitting to his colleagues at tha time whan the Cabinet broke off negotiations was the document which I had in plain terms and with tha concurrence of the Prima Minister told him I was certain would not bo satisfactory to the Cabinet.My own impression Is clear that at no moment in the discussions on Saturday or Sunday wars we within reach of any arrangement,      On the contrary I never lost my belief that the    limited authority within which tho T.U.C* was negotiating disabled them from agreeing to tha only basis which we were authorised to discuss.AH our discussions, as I have said, were confidential, but I think it right to place my clear recollection upon record in writing,as some publio discussion has already taken pise a upon the matter.India Office.  *6th May,  1926.
