[&quot;This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1926.SECRET.Copy No.   30CP. 140 (26).CABINET.IMPERIAL WAR GRAVES  ENDOWMENT  FUND BILL.THE Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum (CP. 132 (26)) appears to be based upon a misapprehension as to the nature of the Bill which is shared by the Dominions also. The Bill is not one to interfere with or control in any way the Imperial War Graves Commission or its funds. The decision of the Government was to accumulate an endowment fund by instalments; the Commission is not to touch it until the fund is complete, when the income will be handed over to the Commission free of control. Meanwhile, the funds are held in trust, and the Bill is necessary to regulate the powers of the Trustees.We are advised by Crown Counsel that it is impossible under English law to accumulate the income of a trust fund in the manner proposed. The Bill gives this power as regards all the contributions, and requires the Trustees, in accordance with the Governments decision, to accumulate the income from the United Kingdom instalments until such time as the fund is complete. It necessarily follows that Parliament voting money subject to condition must be satisfied that the condition has been fulfilled, and this is secured by the audit clause of the Bill by means of Parliaments own officer, the Comptroller and Auditor-General.It would not be right to attempt by a Charter, which is an act of the Sovereign in Council, to over-ride the provisions of the law, and the constitutional position would not be secured merely by giving the Trustees the power to accumulate and not requiring them to do so.As regards the incorporation of the Trustees, they are a permanent body intended to go on for ever, and the Government was advised that the incorporation was necessary.Finally, I would observe that there is nothing unusual, as appears to be alleged, in carrying out the conclusion of an Imperial Conference by legislation rather than by Charter. Legislation is necessary, i.e., the Appropriation Act, to carry into effect the regular arrangement as to voting the provision of money for the Commission itself, and where it is a case of Parliament voting money for an endowment fund legislation is clearly the right way of carrying into effect the intentions of Parliament.w. s. c.March 29, 1926.[14367]
