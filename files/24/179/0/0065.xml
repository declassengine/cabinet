report.[NOTE. Throughout this Report all references to Naval Forces include those main-tained by the Governments of the Dominions, while all references to Land and Air Forces include those maintained by Great Britain only.&apos;]TERMS OF REFERENCE AND COMPOSITION.1. The Cabinet on the 18th December, 1925, decided that the Sub-Committee on the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments should be reassembled to advise the Cabinet, through the Committee of Imperial Defence, as to the course to be followed as the result of the recent Meeting of the Council of the League of Nations at Geneva.2. We accordingly reassembled on the 6th January, 1926, but, before embarking on a detailed examination of the resolutions adopted by the Council of the League, we felt that it would be advisable to take further steps to secure the co-operation of the Dominion Governments in our deliberations. At that time the only Dominion Representative associated with us was Mr. J. S. Smit, the High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa. We therefore requested our Chairman to bring this question once more to the attention of the Prime Minister, and we were very glad to learn that, as a result of his representations, the Dominion of New Zealand and the Commonwealth of Australia had nominated Colonel the Hon. Sir James Allen, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., and Brigadier-General T. H. Dodds, C.M.G., C.V.O., D.S.O.. respectively to serve on our Sub-Committee.3. Owing to the importance which disarmament has assumed, and in order to provide for the rapid examination of any particular problem which might arise during the absence of the British Delegates at Geneva, the Prime Minister considered that ministerial representation on the Sub-Committee should be strengthened. He therefore invited the Most Hon. the Marquess of Salisbury and Major W. E. Elliot to serve on the Committee, and we have therefore had the advantage of their experience and advice in our work since the 22nd February, 1926.4. The question naturally arises whether, in the endeavour to fix a ratio of &quot;Armaments &quot; between individual States, the &quot;Armaments &quot; maintained by each Dominion would be considered separately from those of Great Britain and of other Dominions, or whether, as in the case of the Washington Conference, the Armaments of all the Dominions and of Great Britain would be considered collec-tively. This question, though, of course, of great importance, is not, however, one which seems likely to be directly raised during the deliberations of the Preparatory Commission, but is rather a matter which would come up at the Disarmament Conference itself after the report of the Preparatory Commission has been adopted. In any case it would be very undesirable that any discussion of this question at the Preparatory Commission should take place until the Governments of the Dominions have had an opportunity of considering it. For this reason, therefore, we refrain from making any specific recommendation on the subject at the present time.THE PRESENT SITUATION IN REGARD TO ARMAMENTS.5. Before passing to an examination of the resolutions adopted by the Council of the League, there is one other point to which we think it advisable to draw attention, namely, the present situation of the armaments maintained by this country in relation to any future schemes of reduction or limitation of armaments.(a.) Our Imperial naval forces were considerably reduced after the war  indeed, millions of tons of warships were scrapped, and then a further considerable reduction was brought about by the Washington Conference. By this agreement a definite limit was imposed on the defensive power of thedarger surface vessels, i.e., battleships, battle cruisers, cruisers and aircraft carriers, but similar restrictions were not applied either to submarines or to aircraft. If, owing to the development in the power of these two weapons, it is found impossible, within the limits of the tonnage stipulated, to make the classes of surface vessels mentioned above reasonably immune from submarine or aircraft attack, then it- may be advisable at the end of, if not within, the period fixed by the Washington Agreement, to ask for an increase in the tonnage limits at present in force. Up to date nothing has been done to limit the power of attacking the trade routes, either from the air or under the water, and as the example of Germany during the war may unfortunately be followed in another [14470] - ^ - ^ ^
war, it becomes more and more incumbent that our naval forces shall be numerous enough to defend the Mercantile Marine, on whose maintenance the Empire so largely depends. We consider, therefore, that, having regard to the circumstances set out above, before any further limitation of our naval forces could be considered, international agreement should be obtained as to the number, size and gun armament of submarines. Even if this could be effected, it must be remembered that our trade routes are very long and vulnerable. To protect them a certain number of cruisers are essential, whatever naval forces other Powers may have. The Admiralty are, therefore, of opinion that, even if a general agreement for the reduction of naval forces were secured, the British Empire must have very special treatment in regard to its number of cruisers. It would, however, in any case, be feasible for us to agree with other nations upon a lower limit to the size of cruisers, and to the calibre of guns which they were permitted to carry. It would also be feasible to limit the size of torpedoes to be carried in all ships.Very considerable economies might follow such an agreement, which would presumably also affect the gun armaments of aircraft carriers and submarines.(b.) Our Army is notoriously small, having regard to our world wide commit-ments and the length of our land frontiers throughout the Empire, and from the standpoint of disarmament its strength compares favourably with the forces main-tained by many other States. The size of our land forces is not regulated by the size of those of any other Power. It depends on quite other considerations, and, there-fore, could not be reduced in consequence of an agreement with other military Powers.(c.) Even to a greater extent than the Royal Navy our Air Forces were reduced almost to the vanishing point immediately after the war. Since then a progressive programme of development has been adopted which aims at providing us with an air force comparable to that of our nearest neighbour by 1930. Recently this date of completion has been postponed till 1935. At the present time our strength in the air is in marked inferiority to the force maintained by France, and we would welcome any scheme of reduction and limitation which would result in a measure of equality being established between the air forces maintained by ourselves and the other countries of Europe. It is for consideration, failing the adoption of a universal scheme for limitation and reduction of Air Armaments, whether resort could not be made to a specific agreement between Great Britain and France.6. Our recommendations, therefore, in regard to the reduction and limitation of our own forces may be summed up as follows : (a.) The strength of the Navy is not dependent solely on the strengths of the Naval forces of other countries, but is also governed by the length and vulnerability of the Trade Routes which we are bound to protect. In any measures for the reduction of Naval forces special consideration must be given to the Biitish commitments arising from the length and vulnera-bility of the trade routes of the Empire.(b.) Having regard to the existing Washington Agreement for the reduction and limitation in our Naval Forces, the only other directions in which further reductions and limitations can be carried out are (i) the number, size and gun armament of submarines; (ii) (a) the size of cruisers;(b) the calibre of guns mounted on board cruisers;(Note. (a) and (b) are interdependent, but (a) shoidd be &amp;u ,\-!:u;;u -s v.u  -n-f^&amp;fe:-W! ^^ffonsideratidn^ if&apos;-ihe:*ojfensive, power of &apos;-&apos; i       -l^siiv&apos;marines1 and aircraft show -any, ;marked increase.)(hi) limitation of size of torpedo tbWcafMed in&apos;ail ships.(c) T^e^size&apos; of&quot;our&apos;&apos;Army&quot;is&apos;noTdependent&apos; 6n&apos; that&apos;bf the &quot;Armies of other Powers, and, therefore, no reduction of its striehgth-inconsequence of a general agreement is possible. In fact, it barely suffices for the duties which it has to carry out.(d.) The present situation whereby the air forces maintained by us are in marked inferiority to those of France cannot safely be perpetuated, and we should welcome any measure of reduction which would bring a?out a condition of greater equality.
PROCEDURE OE THE PREPARATORY COMMISSION.7. The Resolutions of the Council of the League of Nations in regard to the work of the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference are contained in two Reports by M. Benes which were adopted by the Council on the 12th December, 1925, viz. : (a.) Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference;  and (&amp;.) List of Questions to be examined by the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference.These two reports are attached as Appendix A and Appendix B respectively to this report. *8. The first of the two reports mentioned above deals with the Title, Composition and Procedure of the Preparatory Commission, and only calls ior comment in one particular. By the terms of M. Benes&apos; report it will be seen that the Permanent Advisory Commission is the technical organ nominated by the Council to advise the Preparatory Commission on the naval, military and air aspects of the questions enumerated in. the second report. Now the Permanent Advisory Commission is a properly constituted and permanent organ of the League of Nations, and it is important to avoid any action which may have the effect of tampering with its constitution and procedure and which may be quoted as a precedent in the future. At the same time, it is essential that all the States par-participating in the work of the Preparatory Commission should have an equal Opportunity of expressing their views on any technical matter relating to the naval, military and air aspects of the questions under consideration. To meet this difficulty the Council, on the 18th March, 1926, adopted the following resolution : &quot;The Council invites the States represented on the Preparatory Commis-sion for the Disarmament Conference to appoint military, naval and air experts, who would sit on the Permanent Advisory Commission on a footing of equality with members of that Commission whenever it was convened to assist the work of the Preparatory Commission in accordance with the report approved by the Council on the 12th December, 1925.&quot;THE THREE KINDS OF ARMAMENTS TO BE considered separately.9. With regard to the second report by M. Benes, namely, that in which he submitted to the Council a list of. questions to be examined by the Preparatory Commission,&apos; there are certain points in the body of the report to which we think attention should be drawn before we pass on to an examination of the questions themselves.10. In our previous report (Committee of Imperial Defence Paper 649-B, paragraph 9) we recommended that a Conference on the subject of Naval disarma-ment, in view of the past history of the question, would best be held in Washington. The French, Italian and Japanese Governments, however, indicated through their representatives at Geneva that &quot; they could not see their way to dissociate the various kinds of armaments military, naval and air and to consider them at separate Conferences.&quot; Since this declaration was made, the United States of America has announced its intention to participate in the work of the Preparatory Commission at Geneva. Our main reason for supporting a separate Conference on the naval aspect of the problem has, therefore, fallen to the ground.11. But the declaration of the three Governments mentioned above also raises the question&apos;as-tovwhether each of the three-kinds of. armaments military, naval and air should be examined -separately\or. collectively,-.for the purpose of fixing the ratio of armaments which i&amp;$o.-be permitted to each State. We are of the opinion that it will be very difficult indeed to combine in one index figure the proportionate strength of each of the three armaments to which each State would be justifiably entitled, since the purposes f or which each of the armaments is required vary to a considerable extent. For example, as already mentioned, the strength requisite for the Navy is largely dependent on the length and nature of the trade routes which have to be guarded, while the strength of continental armies is governed by the extent of its land frontiers, the nature of its relations with coterminous States and the size of the* Sufficient copies of the appendices are not available, but will be circulated when received from Geneva.
armies maintained by those States. Moreover, it seems quite impossible to compare the armament value of a battalion, a battleship and an air squadron. To reduce these dissimilar factors to one common denominator would appear to pass the wit of man, and if attempted, to be likely to lead to the adoption of an arbitrary ratio bearing no relation to the realities of the case. We recommend, therefore, that each of the three kinds of armaments naval, military and air should be considered quite separately from one another.INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION.12. M. Benes&apos; report also contains a reference to the question of international supervision to ensure that the provisions of any agreements regarding a limitation of armaments are being observed, and suggests that this question should be examined by the Preparatory Commission. It is pointed out that &apos;&apos; the French delegate emphasised the necessity of such supervision, particularly during the period when the arbitration and conciliation proceedings provided for in the Covenant and in the various agreements recently concluded were in progress.&quot;13. We have considered this question of supervision, and are of the opinion that the adoption of any prearranged system for its imposition bristles with difficulties. For instance, it would be against the principles on which our naval, military and air attaches are at present accredited to foreign countries, for these officers to be charged with the duty of supervising and reporting on any infringements of the agreements contemplated, and we are opposed to any change being made in these principles.14. It has been suggested that international attaches, serving the League of Nations itself, might be accredited to foreign countries for the express purpose of supervising the fulfilment of provisions of any limitation agreements. Unless, however, these attaches are given wide and ample powers by mutual agreement they wdll be unable to discharge their duties; while, if these powers are accorded, their presence in the country may be resented and would probably not be agreed to.15. We are of opinion, therefore, that no system of permanent supervision is either practicable or desirable.16. Another suggestion which we have examined is that of a system of compul-sory supervision by means of a Special Commission of Investigation, where complaint is made that the terms of any Agreement for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments which may be the outcome of the present enquiry has been infringed in some particular case. We are, however, opposed to such a system, since any Commission of compulsory investigation, which was calculated to prove an effective instrument of control, would need to have access to buildings, and to have power to examine into matters, such as designs, patents, industrial plans and processes, leading perhaps to the divulgence of secret information. To grant these powers to any Commission would necessitate special legislation, and we are of opinion that in this country and others it would probably be impossible to secure its passage into law. We are of opinion, therefore, that compulsory supervision of this nature is also neither practicable nor desirable.17. It must not be forgotten in this connection that Article XI of the Covenant gives the Council power to &apos;&apos; take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations &quot; where there is any threat of war. If, therefore, there were such a breach of the Agreement for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments as to amount to a threat of war, the Council could act on this power, subject, of course, to the rights of a sovereign State.18. Finally, in this connection, we would draw attention to the very great difficulties inseparable from any system of supervision and control, as is shown by our own experience&apos; iii1 endeavouring to ensure that&apos;-the disarmament, provisions of the Peace Treaty were observed by Germany,-Austria and Hungary. In these cases, although armed with extraordinary powers, Commissions of - Control have been continuously employed for over three years. We feel; therefore, that in the endeavour&apos;tb reduce&quot; aftd -limit armaments^eliariee^rjst mainly be -placed on the good faith of the parties to any Agreement. 1 lV--&apos;19. We therefore sum up our recommendations on this aspect of the problem as follows :  Nq form of permanent or compulsory supervision is either practicable or desirable, but reliance for the observance of the provisions of any Agreement to reduce and limit armaments must mainly rest on the good faith of the parties concerned.
THE QUESTIONNAIRE.20. We now pass to an examination of the list of questions adopted by the Council on the 12th December, 1925.Question I.What is to be understood by the expression &quot; armaments &quot;f(a.) Definition of the various factors military, economic, geo-graphical, &amp;c. upon which the power of a country in time of war depends.(b.) Definition and special characteristics of the various factors which constitute the armaments of a country in time of peace; the different categories of armaments (military, naval and air), the methods of recruiting, training, organisations capable of immediate military employment, &amp;c.21. Having regard to the great difficulty inherent in any attempt to define, for purposes of disarmament, the full capacity of a country for war, we are of the opinion that, if any practical step towards a reduction of armaments is to be secured, it is essential that this very complex problem should be reduced to as simple a form as possible. We therefore recommend that the expression &quot; Armaments &quot; should be denned as :  &quot; Forces immediately available on the outbreak of war and the material maintained for their use,&quot;and we consider that this definition is sufficiently comprehensive for the present purpose, and that to attempt a definition of the various factors enumerated in the sub-heads to Question I would only serve to confuse the main issue for which the Preparatory Commission was set up.Question II.(a.) 7s it practicable to limit the ultimate war strength of a country, or must any measures of disarmament be confined to the peace strength?22. We are convinced that&apos;it is quite impossible to limit the ultimate strength of a country, and that any measures of disarmament must be confined to the peace strength only.We recommend therefore that &quot; All measures of limitation should be confined to &apos; Armaments &apos; as definedabove maintained in time of peace, and that no attempt should be made to Mmit&apos; ultimate war strength.&apos; &quot;23. In this connection it should be noted that the Admiralty who advocate, as far as the Navy is concerned, the standard for a country being based on the numbers and types of ships of war &quot;maintained in peace time,&quot; consider that this term includes all warships maintained in reserve.Question II.(b.) What is to be understood by the expression &quot; reduction and limitation of armaments &quot; fThe various forms which reduction or limitation may take in the case of land^ea md. fjir,fpr.qes; the^ela^ive. adparfiagpsjr disadvantages of each of the differwtifQrmsiormethods; for &apos;exa^l^,fijh^ reductionp,f the larger peace-time&apos;units or of, $heir&apos; establishment and Weir equipment, of of any immediately mobilisable forces; the reduction of the length of active service, the tredvc$&apos;imn&apos;ofr-th0i quantity^of military f&amp;tiPW&amp;ifrt,thfi ,Tpdnctiov of expenditure on national defence, &amp;c.24. We consider that the expression &quot; reduction and limitation of Armaments &quot; should be defined Reduction as Reduction of &quot; Armaments &quot; to a certain standard.Limitation as Restriction of &quot;Armaments &quot; within a certain strength.
question III.By what standards is it possible to measure the armaments of one country against the armaments of another, e.g., numbers, period of service equipment, expenditure, &amp;c?25. The answer to this question in regard to naval forces is comparatively-simple, as no great difficulty is encountered in defining a &quot; unit &quot; where vessels of war are concerned. We recommend therefore that for naval purposes the standard of measurement should be &quot; The number and size of ships and the calibre of the guns carried.&quot;26. With military forces the question is, however, very complex. We are of opinion that it is essential to combine in some form the numbers of men available and the nature and extent of the equipment for them.27. We consider that the abolition of the system of conscription, as understood by the chief military Powers of Europe, would of itself impose a certain measure of Disarmament. It has the advantage that no complicated formula is required for application to each individual State; we recognise, however, that it would be difficult to secure its adoption.28. We have examined various methods whereby a limitation might be imposed on the striking power of a State, such as the compilation of a schedule of military equipment or the fixing of budgetary expenditure, which must not be exceeded. The first would involve the institution of&apos; an irksome system of supervision, which might prove to be the cause of endless friction between States, and would probably be impracticable; while the latter, if applied to the whole military Budget, would be misleading as long as the difference exists between conscript and volunteer armies, and even if limited to particular classes of expenditure would be open to so many methods of evasion as to be practically valueless unless combined with other restrictions. The best that can be hoped is that a well-defined limitation of expenditure on Material might be a useful subsidiary check on any limitation of effectives, which must be the primary basis of any scheme of disarmament.29. We have been informed, however, that a restriction of the number of men automatically imposes a certain measure of limitation on the amount of material, since a given number of men cannot usefully handle more than a certain amount of material. We recommend, therefore, that the standard of measurement in regard to military &quot; armaments &quot; should be &quot; The numbers of effectives together with the amount of equipment appropriate to their use.&quot;30. We have considered the possibility of the reduction of the period of service in conscript armies. This, however, will not decrease the number of men trained. At the outbreak of war an equally large number of men could be put into the field. It is true that their efficiency would be less, though this difficulty can be met to some extent. In any case, though a reduction in the period of service may have some political and economic advantages, it can scarcely be regarded as an adequate solution of the problem of Disarmament if States resort to an intensification of the training of reservists and the introduction of civilian labour for administrative services.31. Provided that a definite limitation in the number of effectives had been adopted, a useful subsidiary check on the observance of this limitation would be obtained if the expenditure incurred on certain definite and limited classes of military equipment could be regularly ascertained. Owing to the, different methods by which Budgets are drawn up comparable information of the character required is not at present available in the National Budgets;, but it, might be arranged that each State should furnish the League regularly with a detailed statement, in a comparable form, of the estimates of expenditure on the items selected at the commencement of each financial year, and of the actual expenditure as soon as possible after the end of the financial year. If possible, statements should also be obtained of the stocks held from previous years, and of the extent to which they are drawn upon. We add therefore to our recommendation formulated above a note to the effect that &quot; Regular statements, in a comparable form, of the expenditure on such equipment might furnish a valuable indication as to the &apos; Armaments &apos; maintained.&quot;
32. The difficulty in regard to air forces lies in the fact that it is quite impossible to divest civil aircraft from very considerable potential military value. Nevertheless, although the existence of civil aircraft constitutes a grave military danger, which must at all times be taken into consideration, we are of the opinion that in order to initiate a measure of disarmament in the air, civil aviation might, in the first instance, be disregarded, although is must be emphatically stated that the question of any reduction of air armaments is in fact indissolubly allied with that of limitation of civil aircraft. A first step in the direction of reduction and limitation might be taken by means of special agreements between the British Government and some of the other Powers who maintain air forces, and that for the sake of simplicity this first step might be confined to Metropolitan Forces (i.e., all shore-based aircraft within the limits of the country whose Government is a Party to the agreement). We recommend, therefore, the standard in regard to Air :&apos; Armaments &quot; should be &quot; The personnel and aircraft on the establishment of First Line Units of Metropolitan Forces (i.e., all shore-based aircraft within the limits of the country making the agreement).&quot;Question IV.Can there be said to be &quot; offensive &quot; and &quot; defensive &quot; armaments?Is there any method of ascertaining whether a certain force is organised for purely defensive purposes (no matter what use may be made of it in time of war), or whether, on the contrary, it is established for the purposes im) the spirit of aggression?33.   We are of opinion that &quot; It is impossible to distinguish between offensive and defensive &apos; armaments,&apos; except in the case of fixed defences.&quot;Question V.(a.) 0??/ what principle will it be possible to draw up a scale of armaments permissible to the various countries, taking into account particularly Population; Resources;Geographical situation;Length and nature of maritime communications; Density and character of the railways;Vulnerability of the frontiers and of the important vital centres near the frontiers;The time required, varying with different States, to transform peacearmaments into war armaments; The degree of security which, in the event of aggression, a State couldreceive under the provisions of the Covenant or of separateengagements contracted towards that State?34. We have devoted a considerable amount of time to the consideration of this question, and are of the opinion that it is quite impracticable to devise an index figure which would represent all the factors involved. It was suggested to us that much the same result might be obtained by selecting any particular period, which would necessarily have to be before the outbreak of the Great War, and by adopting the scale of &quot; armaments &quot; then maintained as the basis on which a ratio between the various States could be fixed for the future. We were obliged, however, to reject this suggestion because of the number of complications involved owing to the various new States which have been created since the war and to the fact that air armaments did not exist to any appreciable extent in the pre-war period.35. Another suggestion which we have considered is to the effect that, in the first instance, each State should be invited by the League of Nations to fix its own standard of &quot; armaments.&quot; The standard of each State would then be examined by the League, both on its own merits and also in relation to the proposed standards of other Powers, and it would then be the duty of the League to co-ordinate all these standards and to induce Powers to accept reductions where these appeared to be necessary.   In other words, no definite principle should be adopted a priori, but[14470] c
the settlement of the problem should be left to special negotiations when the other difficulties inherent in a scheme of disarmament have been settled.36. Whether this last suggestion would prove acceptable to the Nations assembled at Geneva we are not in a position to express an opinion, but it is of course, an essential to its practical working that all States--particularly Russia-should be parties to any arrangements come to.37. In any event we are convinced that the cause of disarmament will not be furthered by embarking at present on an examination of the various factors enumerated in this part of Question V. Indeed, we consider that any premature attempt to undertake such an enquiry might well bring the whole Disarmament Conference to an abortive end, and we therefore recommend that &quot;Discussion on Question V (a) should, be avoided as long as possible as any direct solution seems to be very difficult, if not impracticable. If all other questions can be settled, the solution of this question may probably emerge naturally as a result.of the &quot; atmosphere &quot; created by the settlement of the other questions.&quot;Question V.(b.) Can the reduction of armaments be promoted by examining possible means for ensuring that the mutual assistance, economic and military, contemplated in Article 16 of the Covenant, shall be brought quickly into operation as soon as an act of aggression has been committed?38. This question represents an extension of the scope of the Committee&apos;s deliberations, which was agreed to as a compromise between the views of the French and British delegates. It is understood that the object of the question is to secure an examination as to whether Article 16 of the Covenant can be regarded as effective at present and as to what steps can be taken to make it effective. It is obvious that any such examination may reopen the political difficulties raised by the Geneva Protocol and the introduction of this question may be intended to afford a convenient excuse for a refusal to undertake any substantial measure of disarmament. The policy of the British representative should be directed to press for the reduction and limitation of armaments as being in itself an element of security. But we cannot refuse to explore the actual possibility of carrying Article 16 into effect.39. It would appear that Article 16 of the Covenant, when originally drafted, contemplated economic pressure being applied primarily by measures taken within their own jurisdiction by Members of the League without necessarily being accom-panied by a Declaration of War.40. To be effective it is necessary that these measures should be taken simultaneously and uniformly by all the principal nations of the world-a condition which in present circumstances cannot be fulfilled. There is, therefore, a grave danger that those States which acted at once would merely be strangling their own trade for the benefit of those who delayed or refused to take action, and, would thus inflict more damage on themselves than on the Covenant-breaking State.41. The amendments to Article 16 and the principal resolutions adopted by the Second Assembly &quot; as rules for guidance &quot; are designed with the object of securing so far as possible unanimity and uniformity of action on the part of members applying economic measures against the,aggressor. They propose that action should be taken inter alia in the following progressive stages : (a.) The Council should, at the request of any Member, deliver an opinion as to whether a breach of the Covenant has taken place or not, and, in case of the former, should notify to all Members the date on which it is proposed that the application of economic pressure should commence.(b.) The Council should recommend a plan of joint action, which in the first instance should involve the severance of diplomatic relations. Other steps would follow when it was seen which of the Members of the League were prepared to carry out their obligations, such as the severance of com-munications and direct commercial relations with the aggressor&apos;s territory. If these failed, the cutting off of food supplies should be adopted and it was recognised that in special circumstances, the imposition-tion of an effective blockade may be advisable involving the declaration of a state of war between the Covenant-breaking State and the other members of the League.
42. In some cases it might well be that the gradual application of pressure involved would weaken the probable effect of the sanctions. But in so far as these proposals would tend to secure uniformity of action, and also to indicate the extent to which States are willing to proceed against the aggressor, they are of value.43. If any further examination of the Article is to be undertaken, it should be directed to ensuring that the obligations under this Article should be made more precise, and should at the same time be such as can and will be carried out, bearing in mind that the United States of America is not a Member of the League, and having regard to the fact (a) that the action which each State is to take must, in the first instance, be within its own jurisdiction, and (b) that the economic pressure must be enforced uniformly by all save in the most exceptional circumstances.44. For this purpose it would be desirable that a definite list of measures should be drawn up which all Members would undertake to apply uniformly against Covenant-breaking States on a decision by the Council, and that these should include in the first stages (a.) A severance of diplomatic, and subsequently of consular, relations;(b.) Prohibitions of exports of war material, or enlistment and transport of reservists or recruits from the territory of each State Member to theterritory of the Covenant-breaking State.45. It would be desirable to secure a stipulation by which each State agreed (a) not to claim damages from any other State member of the League or Signatory to the Disarmament Agreement in respect of action taken by that State, in conformity with any decision or recommendation of the Council, to give effect to Article 16 of the Covenant, and (b) that in proceedings for damage between nationals of any of these States it should be a good defence that the damage complained of was caused by the aforesaid action. When under Article 17 the Council invites a non-Member to accept the obligations of membership for the purposes of a particular dispute &quot; upon such conditions as the Council may deem just,&quot; it could presumably apply the above stipulation to the outside State. It would, however, be impossible to impose it on a State which refused the invitation, and there seems no way of overcoming this difficulty.46. The above measures can, in the case of Great Britain, probably be taken by executive act. Indeed, the Secretariat of the League was informed in 1921 that under the Treaty of Peace Act, the British Government could take any action required to enforce Article 16 without legislation. But although this is the legal position, it appears very doubtful whether any British Government could in fact impose wholesale restrictions which might cause serious losses to British traders without reference to Parliament. It is desirable that each State should obtain any powers necessary to enable it to enforce immediately such measures as may be agreed upon so that uniformity of action cannot at the last moment be evaded by reason of constitutional objections.47. Should limited measures of this kind fail to secure submission, measures of increasing stringency may require to be taken. As a final stage the Council will presumably recommend that war measures be taken and States Members deciding to declare war against the Covenant-breaking State will exercise full belligerent rights. This, as stated, would be the final stage, and neither this country nor, it may be anticipated, any other country will pledge itself in advance to go to war on a recommendation of the Council. By Article 16 it is left to each State to decide whether a resort to war by a Covenant-breaking State has actually occurred, and whether, in consequence, the obligation undertaken by Article 16 has become effective.48. In view of the grave difficulties and dangers of the enforcement of financial as opposed to economic sanctions, we recommend that no attempt should be made to enforce any financial restrictions except (a.) Indirectly viz., by the inconvenience caused through a stoppage of communications; or(b.) After a declaration of war.49. There is an entirely different course which might be adopted, viz., the granting of positive financial assistance to the aggrieved, rather than the imposition of restrictions on the aggressor. It might, for example, be considered whether the British representative should be authorised to suggest that a plan might be elaborated, whereby the more important and more solvent States would agree to[14470] u
facilitate the flotation of loans in their markets by any State which had to resist aggression, and even, if necessary, to give separate guarantees for varying proportions of such a loan as was done in the case of the Austrian Reconstruction Loan. Strict safeguards would, of course, be essential, covering the amount of the loan, and the purposes on which it could be used, as well as the security which the borrowing State would have to assign to the service of the loan. If a plan of this kind could be elaborated and the many difficulties inherent therein overcome, it would immediately add to the sense of security of States who fear aggression, and, when the time came, afford an impressive demonstration of solidarity.50. His Majesty&apos;s Government would no doubt find it difficult, in the present state of the national finances, to ask Parliament for power to give any guarantee of the kind indicated above. In so far as the financial position of the country was strengthened by a general reduction of armaments, this objection might be diminished. A successful scheme for the limitation of armaments would, it may be hoped, enable a reduction to be effected in British expenditure on armaments, and in any case, should contribute materially to the restoration of economic prosperity in Europe and thus directly assist British trade. If, therefore, such a scheme can be secured at the cost of the participation of His Majesty&apos;s Government in a guarantee of financial assistance to an aggrieved State, the consequent financial commitment would, we feel, be economically justifiable and could be reasonably recommended to Parliament.51. In regard to all the above proposals, we wish to point out, however, that the real menace to security in many areas is the competition which exists between neighbouring Powers in the maintenance of excessive armaments, and that measures such as are contemplated by Article 16 for dealing with acts of aggression after they have taken place do little towards the removal of this menace, which can only be brought about by an effective agreement for a Reduction of Armaments and their subsequent Limitation. We recommend, therefore, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should only contemplate contributing to additional or more precise guarantees of security in exchange for definite and substantial guarantees that a genuine scheme of Disarmament will be enforced, and that the degree to which this country would assist an attacked State should be made dependent on the extent of the policy of Disarmament agreed upon by the Conference and on the measure in which that policy is put into effect.Question VI.(a.) Is there any device by which civil and military aircraft can be distinguished for purposes of disarmament? If this is not practicable, how can the value of civil aircraft be computed in estimating the air strength of any country?(b.) Is it possible or desirable to apply the conclusions arrived at in (a) above to parts of aircraft and aircraft engines?52. As we have already pointed out, it is not possible to distinguish between civil and military aircraft for disarmament purposes, but an arbitrary distinction might with advantage be drawn in the first instance in order to make an advance towards disarmament in the air possible. Should this course be adopted, however, it is essential that all &quot; military &quot; air armaments should be considered as a whole, and separately from land and naval &quot; Armaments,&quot; since aircraft normally destined to co-operate with armies and navies can, without either any difficulty or delay, be diverted from their normal functions to operate independently as air forces pure and simple.   We recommend therefore that &quot; Although civil aircraft cannot be distinguished from military aircraft for disarmament purposes, an arbitrary distinction might be drawn between them in the first instance in order to initiate a measure of air disarmament, but that if this course is adopted, Metropolitan air &apos; Armaments &apos; should be considered  IS ci whole.Question VI.(c.) Is it possible to attach military value to commercial fleets in estimating the naval armaments of a country?53. Though undoubtedly commercial fleets do possess a potential military value, the answer to this question depends on the circumstances in which these commercial fleets are employed.   To a country dependent for its existence on seaborne supplies,
the safeguarding of its Mercantile Marine is one of its main war commitments and although it may employ certain mercantile ships for military purposes, the military-value of such support is completely overshadowed by the commitment; in fact a commercial fleet becomes a military weakness. But&apos; in the case of a Country not dependent on overseas supplies, a Mercantile Marine may become a distinct military asset, though not of first-rate importance.Question VII.Admitting that disarmament depends on security, to what extent is regional disarmament possible in return for regional security? Or is any scheme of disarmament impracticable unless it is general f If regional disarmament is practicable, would it promote or lead up to general disarmament ?54. In so far as the Locarno Treaty is concerned, it might be argued that Great Britain&apos;s commitments as guarantor had been increased. On the other hand, in so far as Agreements, such as the Locarno Treaty, make wars less likely, our eommit-ments have in effect been diminished. As a generalisation, we are therefore of the opinion that -&apos;&apos; Regional security does make a measure of regional disarmament possible.(Signed)CECIL -(Chairman).A. C. TEMPERLEY. C. L. N.

Paper No. 682-B.)(Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of 206th Meeting, Minute 1.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the Report of the Sub-Committee on the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments (C.I.D. Paper No. 682-B).LORD CECIL stated that he had little to add to the Report, the constructive suggestions of which he was aware were not very considerable. In a matter of this nature, however, it was necessary to proceed slowly if any positive results were to be achieved. He had not been entirely in agreement with the Members of his Committee on the subject of international supervision, and he thought that, in order to meet the wishes of the other States represented at Geneva, we might be forced to acquiesce in a measure of supervision in certain cases. In his view there could be little objection to accepting the principle that, in certain special cases where a State was willing to accept investigation in order to clear itself of a charge of infringing international agreements on disarmament, a Commission of Enquiry should be established under the auspices of the League to visit the State concerned. The Service Members of his Committee were, however, strongly opposed to any such suggestion, and the Report had, therefore, been confined to a recommendation in paragraph 17, which amounted merely to a reference to the action which could be taken under Article 11 of the Covenant. He was very doubtful whether supervision restricted in this manner would prove satisfactory to the other States at Geneva.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN stated that, generally, he was prepared to accept the Report. He could not say that he was wholly in agreement with its provisions, as it would not be possible to express such an opinion without having gone through all the discussions which had taken place on the Sub-Committee previous to its drafting. There were, however, two points with which he was not in agreement, namely (a.) The suggestion in paragraph 35 that the present state of a disarmed Germany should be taken as the datum level from which the land armaments permissible to other countries should be measured. During one of the conversations which had taken place outside the actual Conference at Locarno, when the possible reactions of the proposed Agreement were under discussion, Herr Stresemann had stated that the Germans would look to the disarmament adopted by other States being proportionate to that which had been imposed upon Germany. To this statement he (Sir Austen Chamberlain) had taken exception at once, and had pointed out that, though the Allies would disarm, the extent of that disarmament would not be proportionate to the present state of a disarmed Germany. It was not reasonable to expect that the victors in the recent struggle should accept the same standard of disarmament as had been imposed upon the vanquished by the terms of the Treaty of Peace; indeed, it had never been intended that France, for example, should be disarmed to the same level as Germany had been. The suggestion in paragraph 35 appeared to indicate that the German plea in this connection was not unreasonable.   He thought it should be made clear that the fact that Germany[14463] [14475 a] n
had been disarmed diminished the dangers to which other nations were exposed and therefore warranted a larger measure of disarmament on their part than would have otherwise been possible, but did not justify any claim that other States should be reduced to the same state of military impotency as had been imposed upon Germany.LORD CECIL said that the object of Question V was to arrive at the scale of armaments which would be permissible to other countries, and, undoubtedly, the fact that Germany was disarmed made it less necessary for France to maintain large forces in order to secure her own protection. He was,&apos;himself, doubtful of the value of the suggestion contained in the paragraph under discussion, and was alive to the risk of a possible retort on the part of France that, if land forces could be measured against the standard of a disarmed Germany, a similar scale of measurement should also be applied to naval and air forces. He thought the proposal might be borne in mind, as the fact of German disarmament had gone to show what small forces were really necessary to maintain internal order and to watch external frontiers. The employment of this argument, however, in an international gathering might prove very dangerous, and should only be resorted to with extreme caution. He had no objection to the whole paragraph being struck out of the Report.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said that he would prefer that the whole paragraph should be omitted from the Report rather than that any attempt should be made to moderate its provisions.(&amp;.) The second point he wished to raise on the Report was in connection with paragraphs 50 and 51, which advocated the granting of positive financial assistance to the aggrieved rather than the imposition of restrictions on the aggressor. This suggestion involved a question of British policy, and though he was alive to the value of some scheme of positive financial assistance as an alternative to the imposition of economic sanctions, he would not like any such proposal to be put forward without a Cabinet decision following on a close and detailed examination by experts on the subject. In fact, he disliked the inclusion of the whole of Question V in the questionnaire. Lord Cecil had resisted its inclusion at the Committee of the Council, and he (Sir Austen Chamberlain) had been asked to state his objections to it at the time. He had then pointed out that the inclusion of this Question amounted to an effort to draw into the discussions on disarmament an intimation of the measure of assistance which a country would be prepared to accord under Article 16 of the Covenant. Any attempt to define in advance, and without reference to any particular state of conditions, what a country would do under Article 16, could only result in very guarded replies from the States concerned, for their answers would inevitably be measured by the case in which they were inclined to do the least. He had asked the French Representatives whether they would be prepared to do, in regard to any dispute which arose, say, in South America, as much as they would be prepared to do in the event of a conflict between Germany and Poland. In fact, the answers would go to show that Article 16 was really of no value whatever, whereas, of course, in certain cases it might prove to be of considerable value. He was anxious to avoid, as far as possible, any discussion of the manner of application of Article 16, and pointed out that the facilities to float loans amounted to nothing unless they were followed by a guarantee on the part of the States concerned, which guarantee it was not possible for us to give.SIR WARREN FISHER explained that the&apos; proposal for positive assistance was the less of two evils. The negative method of economic restrictions was so involved and likely to lead to one-sided results that the Treasury preferred the former alternative. It should not, however, be inferred that the Treasury accepted the proposal willingly. It had only been put forward in case we were obliged, by pressure from other countries, to undertake some action under Article 16.LORD CECIL pointed out that the suggestion of granting facilities to float loans was confined to &quot;the more important and more solvent States,&quot; and that the whole proposal was governed by paragraph 52, which recommended that we &quot;should only contemplate contributing to additional or more precise guarantees of security in exchange for definite and substantial guarantees that a genuine scheme of disarma-ment would be enforced.&quot; From conversations which he had had with M. Boncourt and the Polish representative he had learnt that the smaller Continental States would prefer proposals for,the granting of positive financial help to any promises of military assistance.
SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN remarked that he was doubtful whether the Treasury had in mind any practical scheme for &apos; the granting of the suggested facilities and in his view it was dangerous to put forward any proposal in this connection without being quite certain of the implications involved.SIR WARREN FISHER stated that if the Committee agreed with the principle of according positive assistance, details of the scheme could be worked out by the Treasury.Mr. BRIDGEMAN drew attention to paragraph 27 of the Report, and enquired what was the significance of the words &quot;as understood.&quot; Would the system of conscription adopted by Japan be included under the heading as &quot;understood by the chief Military Powers of Europe &quot; ?LORD CECIL pointed out that the words were intended to exclude the system of conscription adopted by Switzerland as opposed to the German and French systems.   The Japanese system would, therefore, be included.Mr. BRIDGEMAN drew attention to the difference in wording in regard to air armaments employed in paragraphs 32 and 53. In the first instance, &quot; Metro -politan (i:e., all shore-based aircraft within the limits of the country making the agreement,&quot; were mentioned; &quot;while in the second, air armaments were referred to &quot;as a whole, and separately from the naval and land armaments).&quot; He preferred the use of the expression &quot;Metropolitan Air Forces&quot; in both cases.SIR SAMUEL HOARE stated that the Air Ministry were anxious to restrict all agreements in the first instance to Metropolitan Air Forces. If this restriction did not prove acceptable to the other Powers and we were forced to adopt a wider reference, then he thought that it would be essential to draw a comparison between all aircraft, including those normally destined to work with the Navy and the Army, since these aircraft could, at any time, be diverted to c&amp;TTy out independent air operations. If we urged that aircraft normally working in the Fleet Air Arm should, be excluded, then the French might logically argue that all aircraft normally working with the land forces should also be excluded, and we should thereby, owing to the discrepancy in the size of our Army as compared with the French, be forced to accept conditions in which the preponderating strength of the French Air Forces, as compared with ours, would be perpetuated.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said he was prepared to accept the restric-tion to Metropolitan Air Forces, but it might lead to anomalous results, since France would thus be enabled to place any number of air squadrons in her African Colonies.LORD CECIL stated that it was impossible to distinguish between civil aircraft and military aircraft as a potential weapon of offence, but that, for purposes of a reduction of armaments, it might be possible to arrive at an agreement whereby a. purely arbitrary distinction was drawn between them. In this case it was necessary to be careful to include all military aircraft in the agreement, as it was no use merely to diminish the purely air squadrons if the land forces were to be allowed to maintain army aircraft. His Committee had realised and expressly stated that in the endeavour to reduce and limit armaments reliance must mainly be placed on the good faith of the parties to any agreement. If any particular country was going to try and avoid its obligations in this respect, no document would suffice to bind it, and the only course would be to withdraw formally from any arrangements to which we had subscribed. He suggested that Mr. Bridgeman&apos;s objections might be met by inserting the word &quot;Metropolitan&quot; before &quot;Air Armaments&quot; in the last line but one of Article 53 and deleting the words &apos;&apos; and separately from Naval and Land Armaments.&apos;&apos;Mr. BRIDGEMAN referred to Article 54, and stated that he assumed that no discussion would arise at the meetings of the Preparatory Commission on Inter-national Maritime Law.LORD CECIL stated that he did not anticipate that any such discussion would take place, and, in any event, should it do so, he would not participate in it.SIR&apos; LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS drew attention to the question raised in paragraph 4 of the Report as to whether the armaments maintained by each Dominion would be considered separately from, or collectively with, those of Great Britain, and expressed the opinion that, before participating in any discussion at [14463] b 2
Geneva on this subject, we should know exactly what our views were in this matter He understood that the Admiralty was anxious that all Naval Forces should be included in one Imperial Unit; on the other hand, it was essential, so far as Land Forces were concerned, that those maintained by the Dominions should be considered separately. If one single Unit was allotted to the British Empire, the situation might be extremely difficult, since, unless the limitation allowed a large margin, any increase by the Dominions in their forces would result in a decrease in our own Army. He enquired whether Lord Cecil would represent the Empire as a whole in the discussion at Geneva.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN stated that the British Representatives sat on the Council as representatives of the British Empire, while six other Members sat in the Assembly to represent their own Dominions. In the recent discussions at Geneva he had had to refer for further instructions to the Cabinet at home, and he was given authority to adopt a certain course provided that he was able to secure the assent of the Empire Delegates. He called them together for this purpose and eventually they decided that it would be proper for him to give a ruling on the Council while they would be free to give, if they so desired, a contrary ruling in the Assembly. The Canadian Representative had said that he (Sir Austen Chamberlain) did not represent Canada on the Council; on the other hand, the Australian Repre-sentative held that he did represent the Dominions on the Council. Canada&apos;s view was that the British Empire on the Council meant Great Britain and her Colonies and Protectorates, and that the self-governing portions of the British Empire were represented by all the elected Members on the Council. The question was, therefore, still under dispute.Mk. AMERY stated that Lord Cecil represented the Self-Governing Dominions provided that they wished him to do so. The whole question raised a constitutional issue, since it was difficult to reconcile the conception that the British Empire was one so far as Foreign Policy was concerned, and seven so far as the fighting forces were concerned. He did not anticipate, however, that there would be any difficulty in assessing the Dominions&apos; requirements in this particular instance. The quota allotted to the Dominions would almost certainly be far in.excess of the strength of the Forces which they maintained at the present time.LORD CECIL stated that the Dominion Representatives on his Committee were very anxious that no opinion should be expressed on the subject of Dominion quotas at the present time. He proposed to say that it was quite impossible for him to discuss this matter as the whole of the British Empire was affected and their representatives would be meeting in conference in October next when a decision would, in all probability, be reached. He hoped he would be given instructions to refuse to participate in any discussion on this question.SIR SAMUEL HOARE referred to the definition of the standard in regard to air armaments quoted at the end of paragraph 32 of the Report, and stated that what was required was a definition to include the numbers of aeroplanes and their crews which would be ready to go into the air at the commencement of hostilities. It was, therefore, necessary to exclude all reference to reserves, the method of maintenance of which differed in various countries. Any attempt to include reserves and personnel other than crews would, he feared, lead to so vague a definition as to be practically valueless. He pointed out that in this country the Air Force was organised in units, whereas in France a great deal of the work was carried out in depots. If any attempt was made to compare strengths on a unit basis, the result would be to our disadvantage, both as regards personnel and as regards reserves.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN considered that any attempt at a definition of strengths which excluded reserves would destroy all possibility of a reasonable comparison, and that it was essential to take into consideration aeroplanes in being.SIR SAMUEL HOARE pointed out that as soon as any attempt was made to define aeroplanes in reserve, it was almost impossible to draw a line of demarcation between aeroplanes immediately available and those which would take some time tor put into commission, since there were innumerable stages of readiness between an aeroplane completely assembled and the aeroplane,,existing,only in its component parts.
S lord CECIL pointed out that his Committee had tried to arrive, in regard to all armaments, at a definition of forces which could be put into action within a short space of time, in fact, what might be described as the immediate striking force. He would like to have a certain number of the reserves included in this definition, and also some reference to the numbers of personnel maintained.LORD BIRKENHEAD suggested that France would have equal difficulties in regard to formulating an accurate definition, and suggested that, for purposes of comparison, it might be possible to start on the basis which Sir Samuel Hoare suggested without prejudice to any further extension which might be arrived at by agreement.SIR SAMUEL HOARE considered that it would be impossible to arrive at agreement if the definition was extended to include reserves. It was quite clear that what was desired was a definition of the fighting strength which could be put into action in the first stages of hostilities, but once an attempt was made to include reserves and personnel in this definition, the problem became immpdlately very complex and the experts would be unable to agree.LORD CECIL suggested that he and Sir Samuel Hoare should consult together with a view to arriving at an agreed form of words.SIR PHILIP. CUNLIFFE-LISTER drew attention to paragraph 45 of the Report, which referred to the list of measures which members of the League would undertake to apply against covenant-breaking States, and said that the application of &quot; (a) the severance of diplomatic and subsequently consular relations, and (b) prohibitions of exports of war material or enlistment and transport of reserves or recruits from the territory of each State member to the territory of the covenant-breaking State &apos;&apos; were easy to apply, but that &quot; (c) the suspension of direct postal, telegraphic and telephonic communications &quot; meant that all export and import trade would have to be stopped, since trade could not be carried on if all communi-cations were suspended. In the circumstances, therefore, all the issues which had been considered in regard to the Geneva Protocol would be raised again, and it would be impossible to take action without the participation of the United States of America. He thought, therefore, that both in our own interests and on grounds of practicability (c) could not be applied without a previous declaration of war. Further, he considered that paragraph 46 did not go far enough, and that there should be an undertaking that the courts would not operate to entertain claims either by the State or the nationals of that State in the event of contracts being broken. Even then, this provision would not be valid except as regards States which were parties to the Covenant.With regard to paragraph 47, he suggested that powers were required by Order in Council to enforce a complete blockade. In this connection he drew attention to the intimation which had been sent to the Secretariat of the League in 1921 that under the Treaty of Peace Act the British Government could take any action required to enforce article 16 without legislation, but he was not clear whether this ruling had been given before the Sankey decision which illegalised any such action.LORD CECIL stated that though we could take action under (a) and (6) in the Report, the President of the Board of Trade had made a very strong case against our taking any action under (c). In the circumstances he thought that the proposal under (c) went too far, and suggested that it should be deleted from the Report. He asked that the President of the Board of Trade should intimate to the Secretary the words which he would like to have inserted to strengthen the wording of paragraph 46. ...SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER stated that if it was agreed to delete sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 45, there would be no necessity to alter the wording of paragraph 47, and that he would communicate the suggested amendment to paragraph 46 to the Secretary.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN stated that though he was doubtful whether it would be advisable to publish any instructions which were given to the British representative at the present time, he thought that these instructions should be drawn up in the form of a document which could be published when considered advisable. He suggested that Lord Cecil should go through the Report and see how much.of746
it should be included in a letter of instructions which would be given to him by the Foreign Office with a view to the possible publication of this letter at a later date. He added that Mr. Houghton, the American Ambassador, had recently made enquiries from him as to the amount of business which would be transacted at Geneva during the first few days. The French representative had also approached him and expressed his anxiety lest any serious differences should be apparent between the French and British delegates in the early stages of the enquiry at Geneva. He suggested, therefore, that it would be desirable that Lord Cecil should be authorised to see Mr. Houghton, and also to have conversations with M. Fleuriau and Colonel Requin, with the object of securing some sort of harmony between the British and French points of view.LORD CECIL intimated his willingness to fall in with Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s suggestion.Mr. AMERY suggested that the alterations in the Report as agreed by the Committee of Imperial Defence should be communicated to Lord Cecils Sub-Committee with a view to securing the acquiescence of the Dominion representatives who had participated in its compilation.Conclusions. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed *(i.) That paragraph 35 of the Report, containing a suggestion that the present state of a disarmed Germany should be accepted as the datum level from which the land armaments permissible to all other countries should be measured, should be deleted, and such consequential alterations as were necessary should be made in the Report, (ii.) That the Treasury should be asked to work out in greater detail the proposal outlined in paragraphs 50 and 51 of the Report, for granting financial assistance to the aggrieved rather than imposing restrictions on the aggressor.(iii.) That the recommendation at the end of paragraph 53 of the Report should be altered to read : &apos;&apos; Although civil aircraft cannot be distinguished from military aircraft for disarmament purposes, an arbitrary distinction, might be drawn between them in the first instance, in order to initiate a measure of air disarmament, but that if this course is adopted, Metropolitan Air Armaments should be considered        whole.&quot;(iv.) That the British representative should refuse to participate in any discussion on international maritime law which might arise in connection with question 6 (c) (paragraph 54 of the Report), (v.) That in the event of any discussion on the quota of armaments to be allotted to each State, the British representative should refuse to participate in any discussion on the quotas to be allotted to the British Empire on the grounds that this was a matter which affected the self-Governing Dominions, and could not be discussed until after the Imperial Conference in October next.(vi.) That the standard in regard to air armaments formulated in paragraph 32 of the Report should be discussed by Lord Cecil and Sir Samuel Hoare, with a view to arriving at a more satisfactory definition.(vii.) That the words &apos;&apos; With the possible extension to &quot; (c.) The suspension of direct postal, telegraphic and telephonic communications between the territory of each State member and the territory of the covenant-breaking State,&quot;should be deleted from paragraph 45 of the Report, (viii.) That the wording of paragraph 46 should be altered to read :-&quot; It would be desirable to secure a stipulation by which each State agreed (a) not to claim damages from anv other State Member of the League or Signatory to the Disarmament agreement in respect of action taken by that State, in conformity with any decision or recommendation of tne
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, April 19, 1926.Council, to give effect to Article 16 of the Covenant, and (6) that in pro-ceedings for damage between nationals of any of these States it should be a good defence that the damage complained of was caused by the afore-said action. When under Article 17 the Council invites a non-member to accept the obligations of membership for the purposes of a particular dispute &apos; upon such conditions as the Council may deem just,&apos; it could presumably apply the above stipulation to the outside State. It would, however, be impossible to impose it on a State which refused the invita-. tion, and there seems no way of overcoming this difficulty.&quot;(ix.)
