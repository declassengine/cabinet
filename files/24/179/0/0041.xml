Copy no cp. 141 (26).CABINET.. 31The Royal Commission on the Coal Industry.APPOINTMENT OF NATIONAL FUEL AND POWER COMMITTEE ANDDEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH.REPORT BY THE  COMMITTEE  OP  CIVIL  RESEARCH.1. INTRODUCTORY.1. AT their Meeting, held on Wednesday, the 17th March, 1926 (Cabinet 11 (26), Conclusion 2 (b)), the Cabinet decided that the recommendation of the Royal Commission on the coal industry in favour of the establishment of a National Fuel and Power Committee, with advisory powers (Report, Chapter XXII, Recommenda-tion 3 on Reorganisation, pp. 233, 234), should be examined by the following Committee to be established in connection with the Committee of Civil Research : The  Right Hon.  Sir  Arthur  Steel-Maitland,   Bt.   (Minister  of  Labour) (Chairman).Lieutenant-Colonel J. T.  C. Moore-Brabazon, M.C., M.P. (parliamentary secretary, Ministry of Transport) (Vice-Chairman). The Right Hon. Viscount Haldane of Cloan, K.T., O.M. The Right Hon. Sir Alfred Mond, Bt., M.P. Sir Arthur Duckham, K.C.B. Mr. C. H. Merz.Mr. E. A. Cowers, C.B., Permanent Under-Secretary, Mines Department. Mr. J. R. Brooke, C.B., Secretary, Ministry of Transport.Mr. H. T. Tizard, Principal Assistant Secretary, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.Mr&apos; A^ Hemming, C.B.E., ) Joint Secretaries to the Committee.2. At their Meeting, held on Tuesday, the 16th March, 1926 (R.C.C. (26), 1st Conclusions), the Committee on the Report of the Coal Commission agreed : (a.) That the enquiry to be undertaken by the Committee of Civil Research should be extended to cover the recommendations of the Royal Commis-sion in favour of the extension of the existing provision for research in the industry (Report, Chapter XXIT, recommendation 4), as well as their recommendation for the establishment of closer connection between the mining and allied industries (id., recommendation 4s).(b.) That Sir George Barstow, K.C.B., Controller of Supply Services, Treasury, should be added to the Committee of Civil Research for the purpose of this industry..3. At their Meeting, held on Friday, the 19th March, 1926 (R.C.C. (26),. 2nd Conclusions), the Committee on the Royal Commission on the Coal Industry agreed that Mr. David Milne Watson should be added to the Committee of Civil Research for the purpose of the enquiry into the recommendations by the Royal Commission [14364a]
on the reorganisation of the coal industry referred to the Committee by the Cabinet at their meeting, held on Wednesday, the 17th March, 1926 (Cabinet 11 (26), Conclusion 2 (&amp;)).4. ,Mr. Merz was unfortunately unable to attend the Meetings of the Committee owing to his absence on business in America.2. PROPOSED ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL FUEL AND power committee.(a.) Functions.5. We addressed ourselves in the first instance to the recommendations by the Royal Commission in favour of the establishment of a National Fuel and Power Committee.. 6. The precise purpose which the Commission intended this body should serve is not very closely defined in their Report, but we consider that their intention was that it should fulfil a double object, advising the Government on the one hand, and industry on the other, on Fuel and Power problems in their widest economic aspects. Such a Committee would constitute a centre : (a) to which the industries concerned could submit matters of interest; (b) which could obtain and correlate information from those industries; (c) which could give out information in return; and (d) which could advise the Government in regard to fuel problems which, in its opinion, require investigation.7. The Royal Commission clearly contemplated that the body they propose should be advisory in character. We agree with this recommendation in the sense that it should not itself undertake technical research, but that it should carry out economic investigations, and to that end have the right to suggest subjects for research needed for those investigations alike to the Government and to the Research institutions of individual industries. For this purpose the Committee should maintain close contact with the various Fuel Committees and similar bodies maintained by the industries concerned. The work of technical research so far as undertaken by the Government should continue to be conducted as at present by the appropriate Departments. If adequate steps are thus taken to avoid overlapping and consequent friction with existing departments, we think that a Committee such as that proposed by the Royal Commission would be of value both to the Government and to industry.(b.) Terms of Reference.8. We recommend that the terms of reference to the Committee should be as follows :-&quot; To consider and advise upon broad questions affecting the economic use of fuels, their conversion into other forms of energy and cognate problems, having regard to the needs of industry as a whole and in the light of technical developments.&quot;-(a) Character of Committee.9. We consider that the Committee should be a Standing Sub-Committee of the Committee of Civil Research.(d.) Chairman.10. We have been unable to reach agreement in regard to the most suitable form of Chairman for such a Sub-Committee, and are unable, therefore, to submit a recommendation on this point. Mr. Milne Watson and some members of the Committee consider that the best arrangement would be for the Government to invite a business man of high standing, not directly interested in any branch of the fuel industry, to undertake this duty; but other members of the Committee think that such a Chairman, being without ministerial or parliamentary responsibility, would not have sufficient influence on the Government to secure the acceptance by it of recommendations by the Committee. The members who hold this view consider therefore that it is advisable that the Chairman of the Committee should be a Minister of the Crown.(e.) Vice-Chairman.11.. Those members of the Committee who recommend the appointment of a Minister as Chairman favour the appointment of a business man as Vice-Chairman of the Committee.   They do not contemplate that it will be necessary for such a Vice-
Chairman to give whole-time service, but they hope that it will be possible to secure the services of someone who would be willing to take a continuing interest in the work of the Committee and to attend all its meetings. If the Cabinet decide in favour of appointing a business man as Chairman of the Committee these duties-would be undertaken by him, and the necessity for a Vice-Chairman would not arise.(f.) Composition of Committee.12. As regards the membership of the Committee, we recommend that it should be composed of representatives of the principal industries concerned, and of the chief Government departments interested, in the problem of fuel and power. With regard to the former class, we recommend that they should be appointed by the Government after consultation with the representative Associations of the industries in question. We attach importance to the membership of the Committee being kept as small as possible. We recommend that the Committee should be constituted on the following lines and that the Committee of Civil Research should add additional members as required for special purposes.Industrial Members- Two representatives of the Coal Industry. One representative of the Electrical Industry.,, ,,     Gas Industry.,, ,,      Oil Industry.,, ,,      Iron and Steel Industry.,, ,,     Chemical Industry.Official Members A representative of the Treasury.,, ,,     Board of Trade.,, ,,     Ministry of Transport.,, ,,     Mines Department.,, ,,     Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.3. UTILISATION OF COAL.13. The Royal Commission recommend that the Government should give sympathetic consideration to any proposals of the Fuel Research Board supported by the Depart-ment of Scientific and Industrial Research, for the further investigation on a commercial scale of processes for the manufacture of smokeless fuel. We concur in this view and recommend that support should be given for the trying out of experiments on a semi-industrial scale.14. The Royal Commission further recommend that in order to encourage producers to proceed with experiments, an announcement should be made that Government Departments will be instructed to purchase smokeless fuel if and when the Fuel Research Board of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research is able to report that a fuel of this kind is available, which is suitable as regards price and heating value, as raw coal. The majority of the Committee concur in this recom-mendation, but Sir Alfred Mond asks that his dissent therefrom may be recorded.4. RESEARCH.15. The Royal Commission recommend that steps should at once be taken to expand the British Colliery Owners&apos; Research Association, and that funds for this purpose should be provided partly by the industry and partly by the Government.16. We are of opinion that while this recommendation should be accepted in principle, the onus for research should in the main continue to rest upon the shoulders of the industry itself. We believe that industry is fully alive to the importance of research, and we consider that direct assistance from public funds at the expense of the taxpayer would only be justified to a very limited extent. There is, however, still an unallocated balance of the Imperial Trust moneys voted in the year 1917-18 as a grant-in-aid to Imperial research, and we recommend that the question whether a suitable grant could be made from that fund should be considered by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, who should be asked to communicate with the British Colliery Owners&apos; Research Association.
17. The Royal Commission has recommended that the responsibility for co ordinating research work and preserving the proper balance between its various parts should be entrusted to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research We understand that this recommendation can be carried into effect quite simply by a slight extension of existing machinery for the co-ordination of Government research.18. The Royal Commission also recommends that the physical and chemical survey of the national resources by the Fuel Research Division of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research should be pushed on as rapidly as possible, and that local Committees should be established without delay in mining areas. We understand that the Department is taking all possible steps to accelerate this survey.5. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS. 19. We recommend (1.) That the Government should constitute an advisory National Fuel and power Committee on the lines suggested by the Royal Commission. (2.) That this Committee should be a Standing Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Civil Research. (3.) That its terms of reference should be &quot; To consider and advise upon broad questions affecting the economic use of fuels, their conversion into other forms of energy and cognate problems, having regard to the needs of industry as a whole and in the light of technical developments.&quot;(4.) That it should consist of representatives of the principal industries concerned, and the chief Government Departments interested, in the fuel and power problem, the former being appointed by the Government after consultation with the representative Associations of the industries in question, and that the Committee of Civil Research should add additional members as required for special purposes. (5.) That it should be constituted as follows : &apos; Industrial Members  Two representatives of the Coal Industry. One representative of the Electrical Industry. ,, ,,     Gas Industry.,,     Oil Industry.Iron and Steel Industry. ,, Chemical Industry.Official Members A representative of the Treasury.,, ,,     Board of Trade.Ministry of Transport. Mines Department.Department  of  Scientific  and  Industrial Research. &apos;(6.) That as regards the remaining proposals of the Royal Commission dealt with in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Report in regard to the utilisation of coal and the development of research, the action which we recommend in those paragraphs should be taken by the Government.(Signed on behalf of the Committee)ARTHUR STEEL-MAITLAND,Chairman.2,, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, April 14, 1926.o
