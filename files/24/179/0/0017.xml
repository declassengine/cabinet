es DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)si17 (26)CABINET. \COMMITTEE OF HOME AFFAIRS. VPOST OFFICE SITES BILL    (1926). (Memorandum by the Postmaster General).This Bill is in common form and will go forward     as a hybrid Bill.The last Post Office Sites Act was passed in 1908. The object of the proposed Bill is to give the Postmaster&apos; General compulsory powers to acquire land and property adjoining the Head Post Offices at Blackpool, Doncaster and Swansea for the purpose of extending those buildings-.At Blackpool there are a large number of separate ownersj and tenants protected by the Rents Restriction Act.     Host of the property proposed to be acquired Is separated from the Head Post Office by a bye-road, a portion of which it is proposed to acquire and close, as its use will cease when the premises which it&apos; serves are incorporated in the Post Office.At Doncaster there are three different owners, one of whOm is an unwilling seller and another a3ked an exorbitant i , price.     There is also a - small part of the site, the owner - of which cannot be discovered and the title to which will be secured by a Sites Bill.At Swansea the title of part of the property which lies between the Head Post Office and other Post Office property recently acquired, is not clear, and for purposes of planning it is desired to &quot;take two snail parts of adjacent properties; the owners of which are unwilling sellers.As far as possible, the sites in question are being acquired by voluntary negotiations and the compulsory powers sought in the Bill will only be used in the last resort.W. M-T.-eneral Post Office, 19th March, 192C.
