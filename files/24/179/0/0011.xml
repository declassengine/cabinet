. CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,     248THIS DOOUJ-i.&apos;-NT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAITHIQ MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .0 A E- I M E T E T. BROADCASTING.(26). (Memorandum by the Postmaster General).1. I submit for the consideration of the Cabinet the Report of Lord Crawford1a Committee upon the future organisation of the Broadcasting Service, with the following nemorandum on the points requiring decision.The controlling authority.2. The Report recommends (paragraphs 5 and 8) that broadcasting should be controlled by a single authority, composed of not less than five and not more than seven paid Commissioners, not committed to or representative of particular interests, to be appointed by the Crown for a period of 5 years.     The Committee advocate that the Commission should be &quot;Invested with the maximum of freedom which Parliament is prepared to concede&quot;, and that it should not be .:hampered by too rigid rules and too constant supervision by the State.I hope the Cabinet will aooept the principle of a single authority so constituted.   The State must continue to exercise control over oertain matters,   rauoh aB hours of working, wave lengths, power and location of stations, in order to prevent interference with Government and other wirelesa services, but with these exceptions I think it iB important to emphasise that the authority will be free to work out its own policy and, in particular, will have unfettered control of its programme a.Finance*3.   The Report recommends that the revenue required for the broadcasting service should be provided, aa at present,from the annual fee of 10/- charged for a wireleas receiving1, licence
licence.    The Commission propose that the first charge upon the Licence Revenue should be the cost of collection by the Post Officej after that the Commission are to be provided with a revenue &quot;thoroughly adequate&quot; for the maintenance of an efficient service, and the surplus, if any, is to go to the Exchequer.This recommendation appears to me to entail an annual duel between the Commission, the Post Office and the Treasury, as to the income to be provided and would require a critical examination of the policy, estimates and administration of the Commission each year.    The independence which the Committee desire the Commission to enjoy would be impaired and the Government would be saddled with a share of responsibility for the Commission&apos;a management and policy.Furthermore, having regard to the possible ramifications of broadcasting, there is practically no limit to the expendi-ture which might be lavished upon it.   Either there would be no surplus for the Exchequer or the Government would have to accept the unpopularity of clipping the Commission&apos;s estimates.4. There are several grounds upon which the State might reasonably claim a proportion of the licence fees over and above the cost of collection.   Firstly, wireless is by statute a State monopoly, secondly, it is through the regulative powers and control of the State that systematic and effective broad-casting is rendered possible,  thirdly, broadcasting is mainly a luxury, fourthly, although in the nature of an entertainment, it contributes nothing towards the Entertainment Tax.There appears to me much to be said for a definite and permanent apportionment of the licence revenue   between the Commission and the State, preferably according to a sliding scale, moving with the number of licences annually issued. If this proposal commends itself in principle to the Cabinet, a suitable scale might be as follows.    After deducting 12-j$ from the gross licence revenue, to represent the cost of collection,  the balance to be divided as follows:-2. On
first million licences the Commission to receive 90^ the Exchequer \0e/0second       &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;        75^    &quot; &quot; S5^third &quot; &quot; &apos;&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;        60i   &quot; &quot; for. x-u. II II 1 II &quot; II cnf&apos;      II II RAO?fourth ou/o oU/oThe payment for each financial year to be based upon the number of licences issued in the preceding financial year.On this basis broadcasting would receive in 1926-27  708.000  (divided between the present Company and the new Commission) as compared with a payment of  500,000 in 1925-26 (exclusive of  73,000 of arrears).    If the licences rose to 2.200,000 by the end of 1926-27, the authority would receive in 1927-28  774,000.    The Treasury have been consulted and concur in this arrangement,I believe this scheme oould be  justified in principle and would secure a substantial -contribution to the Exchequer, probably  250,000 in 1926-27 and  300,000 in 1927-28 over and above the cost of collection, while providing the Commission with an income sufficient for their requirements and indeed 40fo above their income for the- current year.But I cannot disguise the fact that it would be extremely unpopular both in the country and in the House of Commons,    The Press will organise an agitation for the whole of the licence fees after providing for the cost of collection being devoted to the improvement of the service, and great pressure will be brought to bear upon individual Members of Parliament by the large body of licence holders.5.    If any scheme on these lines is accepted,  it would be some&apos;advantage to have the scale fixed by statute with a view to avoiding periodical demands by the Commission or otherwise for its -revision.    And I suggest that statutory power be obtained to make the payment out of Post Office Revenue  (to which the licence fees are credited) on the analogy of an agency payment.    Among other advantages this would prevent the3. inflation
inflation of the Post Office Vote and hence of  the general total of national expenditure tr   the growing share of the Broadcasting Commission in the Licence Revenue. -The establishment of the Commission.6. The Committee suggest that the Commission should be either (a) set up by statute or (b) incorporated under the Companies&apos; Acts.    There is a third alternative which deserves consideration, viz.,  incorporation by Royal Charter.The House of Commons will no doubt demand some opportunity for Parliamentary discussion, v/hich,  if incor-poration under the Companies&apos; Acts or by Charter is decided upon, could presumably take place either on the Post Office Estimates or possibly on a specific Motion for the purpose.    But there will probably be pressure for a Bill which would admit of debate upon and amendment of detail.7.    If the fin.anci.al proposals outlined above are agreed to,  statutory authority will certainly be required to authorise the Commission being financed direct from Post Office revenue  instead of,  as at present,   through the annual Votes.    The sliding scale or other formula governing the payments to the Commission could be inserted in the fill and would then have the advantage  of permanence.    On the other hand,  it would invite discussion and amendment and there would probably be great difficulty in inducing the House to accept it.    If the Cabinet desire the legislation to be confined to the financial arrangements,  possibly ,a clause in the Finance Bill might suffice.8. If the Commission were incorporated under the Companies.&apos;  Acts,  I am advised that the formula determining its income would not be a matter which would be suitable for inclusion in the Company&apos;s Articles of Association, nor could any legal right to that income be thereby secured to it. The same applies to a Charter;  even if it were4. technically
technically possible, which is open to doubt,  to include the formula in the Charter,  I should anticipate considerable opposition if the House of Commons were invited to authorise by Act the annual payment from public funds of a sum pre-soribed in the Charter in the determination of which the House had had no voice.9. Apart from questions of finance,  the Commission could be invested with all the powers which it requires either by sta,tute or by incorporation under the Companies&apos; Acts or by Charter,  and there is little difference In substance between them.    If the Cabinet consider a Bill can be avoided, I think a Charter would give some additional status and prestige.10. The Report contemplates that the Commission would hold a licence from the Postmaster General under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts with a currency of ten years.    If the body is created by statute a Post Office licence would be superfluous;    the statute would authorise the Commission to carry . on the broadcasting service and would, empower the Postmaster General to make regulations upon the matters of detail which would, otherwise be included in the licence.11.    The remuneration of the Commissioners will have to be provided in the Dill and I recommend that the Chairman should be paid  3,000 per annum and the - remaining Commissioners  1,000 each.    I anticipate that it will be necessary to appoint at least six Commissioners and possibly the maximum of seven recommended in the Committee&apos;s Report.Re1a11ons wi th the Press. 12. At present the broadcasting of news is subject to two restrictions:-(a) The news to be broadcasted must be obtained from one of the recognised news agencies, e.g.,  Press Association, Reuters,  etc.(b) No news may be broadcasted before 7 p.m.; -  &apos;-- The
Tiie first restriction is contained in the agreement between the Broadcasting Company and the Postmaster General, the second in an agreement  between the Press and the Company in which the Post Office acquiesced, though it is not formally a party to it.13. The recommendation of the Crawford Committee (paragraph 9) is as follows:-&quot;We can see no adequate reason for withholding from the Commissioners all ordinary rights as regards the use of copyright material, whether in news or otherwise.    On the other hand, we do not think it necessary to invest them with any special privilege or preference&quot;.The existing restrictions have unquestionably fettered the broadcasting of news in an attractive form.    The Broadcasting Company cannot give out such things as the results of the Derby or the Boat Race or Election results, because they take place before 7 p.m.,  and they are barred from broadcasting descriptive narrative from their own observers or reporters in situ.14.    I recommend that any attempt on the part of the Press to secure the insertion of restrictive clauses should be resisted, and that they should be left to make their own terms with the Commission when constituted.    It may be that the Commission will have to accept some form of restriction, as they are dependent upon the Press for the daily publication of the programmes and for a general news service.    Put it is not, in my opinion, a matter in which the Government ought, or need,  interfere and a policy of non-intervention would be consistent with the spirit of the Crawford recommendation.The broadcasting of matters of controversy. 15. The Report  (paragraph 15)  contemplates the broad-casting of a limited amount of controversial matter within the discretion and under the control of the Commission which6 alone
alone would be responsible for securing impartiality.    I &apos;desire to call special attention to this point becaxise under theexisting regime matters of controversy have been barred, withthe single exception that at the last General Election arrange-ments were mutually agreed whereby the leader of each of thethree political parties broadcasted a 3ingle speech.    Theexercise of any form of censorship is an extremely difficult and invidious task, and I think there is much to- be said for relieving the Government of this responsibility.   But attackswill be made upon the impartiality or-discretion of theCommission, the broadcasting of a partizan speech, whether ona political or industrial controversy, will certainly provokecriticism from some section of the public; and the PostmasterGeneral will be pressed to exercise a veto.    I should be glad toknow if the Cabinet agree with me that -1&quot;(a) controversy should not be entirely: barred:(b) that it, should be within the. control or. the -Commission;and    (c) the Postmaster General should decline to accept responsibility for or to review the Commission&apos;s decisions or arrangements,..16,       Title of new authority.There remains one small, but possibly important, point. The Committee suggest that the new authority be called the &quot;British Broadcasting   Commission&apos;?-. It seems to me that&apos; the word &quot;Commission&quot;,may connote in. the public mind the idea of Government status, which is precisely what I-wish to avoid. I should prefer therefore .that its title should-be&quot;&quot;the- &apos;:-&quot;I&quot;ritish Froadcasting Corporation&quot; and that the &quot;Commissioners&quot; should be styled    &quot;Governors&quot; &quot;or &quot;Directors&quot;.-Summary.17,    To sum up,  a decision is required on the following points:-(a) That a single authority, composed of .not less than five and not more than seven Crown nominees, be set up, to .   .7. control
9KKcontrol and manage the broadcasting ser v :ice.(b) Whether the authority should be styled a &quot;Commission&quot; or &quot;Corporation&quot;.(c) That the Authority be financed by share of the licence-revenue as proposed in paragraph -!,(d) That statutory authority be obtained for payment to be made out of Post Office revenue and not through annual Votes.(e) Whether the authority should be net up  (a) by Statute, or (b) by incorporation under the. Companies&apos;  Acts or  (c) by Charter.(f) That the Chairman be paid  &quot;,000 per annum and the other Commissioners  1,000 each.I(g) That no special protection be given to the Press interests,  but that the new authority should be free to make such arrangements with the Presh as it  thinks fit.(h) That the existing bar on the broadcasting of controversial matters should be removed,  and that the broad-casting of controversy should be within the unfettered discretion of the authority.W.

THE  BROADCASTING  COMMITTEE,  1925.Report.The Right Hon. Sir William Mitchell-Thomson, Bart., K.B.E., M.P., His Majesty&apos;s Postmaster-General.Sib,1. In accordance with your desire, we have given careful attention to the problems outlined in the following terms of reference as submitted to us : &quot; To advise as to the proper scope of the Broadcasting service and as to the management, control and finance thereof after the expiry of the existing licence on 31st December, 1926. The Committee will indicate what changes in the law, if any, are desirable in the interests of the Broadcasting service.&quot;We have held 16 meetings. We have received evidence from 22 individuals or groups and we have considered various memoranda dealing with the subject (Appendix I.).2. We are deeply conscious of the magnitude of the issues involved, not merely as regards their scientific or mechanical aspects, but still more in relation to their ultimate impact on the education and temperament of the country. We have made full use of a valuable report (Cmd. 1951) issued by a committee appointed by the Postmaster-General on the 24th April, 1923, which, under the chairmanship of Major-General Sir P. Sykes, surveyed the situation. If some of our conclusions differ from theirs, it will be understood that the remarkable developments achieved since then, have thrown the whole field into a wider perspective. Progress has been rapid and noteworthy. And at the outset of our remarks we wish to record our admiration for the work accomplished by the British Broadcasting Company. Formed at a moment when Broadcasting was still embryonic regarded by many as a toy, as a fantasy, even as a joke,-the Company by strenuous application to its duties, aided by the loyalty of its staff, has raised the service to a degree which reflects high credit on British efficiency and enterprise.3. Broadcasting has become so widespread, concerns so many people, and is fraught with such far-reaching possibilities, that the organisation laid down for the British Broadcasting Company no longer corresponds to national requirements or responsibility. Notwithstanding the progress which we readily acknowledge, and to the credit of which the Company is largely entitled, we are impelled to the conclusion that no company
or body constituted on trade lines for the profit, direct or indirect, of those composing it can be regarded as adequate in view, of the broader considerations now beginning to emerge.4. It is agreed that the United States system of free and uncontrolled transmission and reception, is unstated to this country, and that Broadcasting must accordingly remain a monopoly,--in other words that the whole organisation must be controlled by a single authority.Four methods seem available, namely : (a.) that the State as such should be responsible;(b) that the licence of the British Broadcasting Company should be renewed;(c) that a new company should be formed on the analogy of the British Broadcasting Company;(d) or else that a public corporation should be set up to act as a Trustee for the national interest in Broadcasting. -;5. British Broadcasting Commission. As already indicated, we do not recommend a prolongation of the licence of the British Broadcasting Company, or the establishment of any similar body composed of persons who represent particular interests. We think a public corporation the most appropriate organisa-tion. Such an authority would enjoy a freedom and flexibility which a Minister of State himself could scarcely exercise in arranging for performers and programmes, and in studying the variable demands of public taste and necessity. The authority can be set up by Statute or under the Companies Acts. However established, it would hold the licence of the Postmaster-General, and in view of the scale,, significance and potentialities of Broad-casting, the proposed corporation should be invested with full authority. Its status and duties should correspond with those of a public service, and its directorate should be appointed with the sole object of promoting the utmost utility and development of the enterprise. We think the &quot; British Broadcasting Corn-mission   would be a suitable title for the new authority.6. Method of Establishing Commission. Should the Corn-mission be set up by Act of Parliament, the Pacific Cable Act (1901) might, with necessary modifications, supply an appropriate model. This Act j^provided for the working and control of the submarine cable between Canada and Australia. Its clauses lay down the conditions of finance, and the schedule incorporates the board, sets forth its constitution and personnel, and also provides for the regulation of procedure, control of property, and due execution of duties.Alternatively the procedure of the Companies Acts might be invoked, and the Commission could be incorporated as a company, limited by guarantee, the sanction of the Board of Trade to dispense with the use of the word. &quot; limited &quot; as part of
its name being obtained, and it will be technically neoessary that the subscribers of the Memorandum of Association shall be the nominees of the Postmaster-General. Many bodies so incorporated, engaged in public or charitable work, and not distributing profits among members, exist.7. Transfer of Undertaking to the Commission. It is clear that the Commission must be an incorporated body invested with all necessary powers. However constituted, certain essential factors must be taken into account : -(a) On the 31st December, 1926, the British Broad-casting Company&apos;s licence expires, and the new authority must be constituted by that date, and the entire property and undertaking of the Company as a going concern be vested in the Commission.(6) Contracts must be taken over, and arrangements for future programmes and the like must be implemented  in short as from that date the Broadcasting service becomes the property and concern of the Commissioners.(c) The repayment of their subscribed capital to the shareholders in the British Broadcasting Company, provi-sion for its debts and liabilities, costs of liquidation, and the fulfilment of pending contracts, &amp;c.. can, we believe, be made without serious difficulty under the terms of the licence and existing arrangements with the Postmaster-General.(d) We attach the greatest importance to maintaining continuity between the old authority and the new. Arrangements must be completed in good time, as it would be most unfortunate were there to be any dislocation of the service, or any withdrawal (even temporary) of the programmes to which listeners have become attached, and for which they have paid. The injury caused by any such interruption might be lasting.(e) We therefore recommend that the Commissioners shall be under obligation to take over the existing staff of the British Broadcasting Company. Where in view of changed conditions it may later on prove necessary to dispense with the service of individuals who would otherwise have been retained, compensation should be paid from revenues of the Commissioners, on a scale to be approved by the Treasury.8. Personnel of the Commission. However the new Commission be constituted, the problem of organising the Board or Governing Body and its Committees seems to us identical. It has been suggested in evidence that the Board should be composed of persons representing various interests, such -as music, science, drama, education, finance, manufacturing and so forth.   We cannot accept this view, since compromise and even
conflict might ensue owing to division of allegiance. On the contrary, we hold that the actual Commissioners should be persons of judgment and independence, free of commitments, and that they will inspire confidence by having no other interests to promote than those of the public service. We hope they will be men and women of business acumen and experienced in affairs. In numbers they should not exceed seven or be less than five, and we recommend that they should be nominated by the Crown. It may be desirable, in order to assist in preserving continuity, that a member of the existing Board of the British Broadcasting Company should be one of the new Commissioners, who would, of course, be empowered, should they think fit, to appoint an Executive Commissioner with a seat on the Board of Management. In the interests alike of continuity and indepen-dence, the Commissioners first appointed should hold office for live years. Thereafter, one should in every year retire by rotation, being, however, eligible for re-appointment. All vacancies on the Commission, casual or otherwise, should be filled by the Crown.The Commissioners will require Advisory Committees, of which a considerable number can be appointed; these may frankly comprise advocates, as their duty will be to ensure due consideration for particular phases of Broadcasting, in relation both to programmes and to scientific progress and research. These important bodies should meet regularly and have ready access to the Commissioners, upon whom would devolve the task of laying down general lines of policy and initiating experiment and research. The Commissioners should appoint these Committees, and in doing so will doubtless consult societies and organisations which are qualified to advise on questions of personnel. We refrain from suggesting any elaborate organi-sation for the Commission at its inception. With the staff of the British Broadcasting Company taken over, we are confident that Broadcasting will continue effectively while the new authority is feeling its way.9. Finance of Commission. We may assume that an annual receivers licence will continue, the Postmaster-General being responsible for the issue and for collecting the fee, and that increasing outlay on plant will be necessary. Moreover, the Commission must be self-supporting and can expect no grant from public funds.(a) We anticipate that the overhead and administrative charges of the new authority will rise. Its Committees will in effect be continuing responsibilities, and the control of programmes will be more onerous than hitherto. The Commissioners will not consist of manufacturers whose remuneration depends less on their fees than on the sale of equipment, and we contemplate that the duties pertaining to the Chairmanship will absorb the greater part of anyB 2
&apos;man&apos;.s time, and should be remunerated accordingly. We think that the remuneration of the other Commissioners should likewise be adequate : only thus can it be reasonably expected that the time, energy, and enthusiasm necessary for the efficient discharge of their onerous duties will constantly be forthcoming. We cannot too strongly press on the Government the vital necessity of appointing Commissioners who will devote earnest attention to their duties. It would be most unfortunate if the programmes came to be treated as matters of routine. Broad and far-reaching issues underlie the whole problem, and even if the cost is considerable it will prove a wise investment to pay such fees as will secure the best available service.(6) Expenditure will govern progress and must be closely watched by the Commissioners. Outlay on bold experiment should not be meagre. Research should be constant, both official and unofficial. The Commission should be em-powered to raise Capital on the security of its income from licence-fees, and the Treasury might also be authorised to advance Capital for approved purposes. All witnesses seem to agree that improvement of the service will increase the number of licensees.(c) (1) The present licence fee is 10s., which we do not consider excessive, as it provides the licensee with long and excellent programmes at the rate of Id. for three days. We think calculations for the future may well be based on the assumption that this licence fee shall be maintained. It is, of course, essential that the Postmaster-General should be completely indemnified against the cost of collecting these fees, and against all other expenditure incurred by him in relation to the broadcasting service.(2) Subject thereto, it will be the duty of the Postmaster-General to pay to the Commissioners from the licence fees an income thoroughly adequate to enable them to ensure the full and efficient maintenance and development of the service.(3) On these conditions, and when the adequate service has been assured, but not until then, it is expedient that the surplus should be retained by the State. It must be remembered that the State is authorising individuals at their free will to use a monopoly vested by Statute in the whole Community. Moreover, the State safeguards the listener against exploitation; takes steps to maintain the efficiency of the service, and also exercises its regulative powers without which broadcasting would be thrown into chaos.id) We hope the Postmaster-General will continue vigorously to detect and prosecute those who conceal their equipment, and thus defraud the public.
(e) We suggest that the Commission&apos;s accounts should be reviewed&apos;by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.10. Duration of Licence. It being impossible to predict the ultimate extent and development of Broadcasting, we cannot devise, an organisation which may not be shown by experience to need revision. On the one hand it is conceivable that Broadcasting might have to become a department of State like the telephone service : on the other it is possible that its character as a monopoly might have to disappear, and that the rights of transmitting should be distributed. While, therefore, it is essential that the new Commission should be so constituted as to command public confidence, it is equally clear that should circumstances change, the Government shall be able to supersede or modify the Commission.We suggest that the Licence should in its general frame-work resemble the existing Licence, and should run for not less than ten years, and be renewable. It will contain a variety of technical provisions which we need not specify, relating to finance, procedure and appointments, together with general powers entrusted to the Commission, and specific restrictions imposed in the interests of the State. It must also be laid down that so soon as the Licence expires or is withdrawn, the Commission, on due provision being made for the discharge of all debts and liabilities, shall be bound to transfer or dispose of its whole undertaking in such manner as the Postmaster-General may direct.11. Patent Rights, &amp;c. The British Broadcasting Company has enjoyed certain advantages which may not appertain to its successor. It has been permitted, without royalty, to use some transmission patents, the property, as we understand, of constituent members of the Company.We have no information as to the value, duration or validity of these patents; but even if their continued user is essential to Broadcasting, we cannot think that their existence will impose any impossible burden on the new authority. It will not be to the commercial interests of the patentees to hamper that authority by making such user unnecessarily burdensome; and while we do not suppose for a moment that the patentees would desire so to do, it may be noted in this connection that Section 29 of the Patent and Designs Act, 1907, may not be without its relevance.12. Copyright, &amp;c. We have received a good deal of evidence, sometimes vague, sometimes specific, showing that Broadcasting-is viewed with alarm by various interests of importance. Such representations have reached us from the press, concert-givers, proprietors of theatres and music-halls, as well as from owners of dramatic, musical and literary copyright. Apprehension is generally felt lest Broadcasting should supplant existing agencies,
professions or pursuits. We heard, for instance, that the musical programmes offered to listeners are so varied and so easily enjoyed, that the private performer will be discouraged from learning the piano, and that the sale of these instruments will accordingly decrease. It was also urged that the concert-givers will be faced by overwhelming competition that the concert as such will suffer, and with its decadence singers, solo-players, and performers generally will be displaced, since the Broadcasting studio can provide but meagre alternative employment. The standard of performance would consequently fall. On the other hand we were assured that the growing-appreciation of music diffused amongst homes where it has never yet penetrated, will arouse latent interests, perhaps even stimulate a wholly new range of ambitions, and thus benefit music both professionally and in its purely artistic sphere.Again, we received interesting evidence from the press, which desires that news shall not be issued earlier than the present hour (7 p.m.), and that what is sent out should only be supplied through News Agencies that the Broadcasting Authority ought not to provide its own material as it pleases. This view was contested on broad grounds. We were told that although Broadcasting may exercise a strong influence upon newspapers (as indeed upon many other circumstances of our daily life), they will adapt themselves to new conditions, perhaps depending more upon narrative and criticism than upon the mere schedule of facts. It was also said that Broadcasting might actually tend to promote circulation. Broadcasting of football news is stated to have increased the sale of American newspapers, which describe in detail the bald facts of victory or defeat as announced from the studio. Similarly, the result of some sporting event, be it a boat-race or tennis-match, will lead interested people to study the longer and more vivid descriptions recorded in the press. On these grounds it was argued that a broadcast announcement, necessarily brief and presented in a fugitive form, acts like a newspaper poster or heading in other words, suggests further study in the fuller, more permanent, and far more convenient form supplied in the press, and often supplemented by pictures.We are not surprised that the evidence should be conflicting, for speculative elements abound, and neither we nor others can predict the reactions of a new and incalculable cycle of scientific resource. But, though we do not claim to foretell the ultimate influence of Broadcasting on literature, the press, the concert platform, or the stage, we are far from convinced that these forebodings are just in that one all-important factor is omitted therefrom. The fears of those who have expressed them are based upon the effect on their existing clientele, whereas there are multitudes to whom these things are a closed book to-day, whose appreciation may well be brought into being, and formulated in such a manner by broadcasting as to create
a new and extensive audience with its fresh demands and requirements. People will realise that secondhand versions, even when reception is more perfect than now, are not a full substitute for the original performance, where the presence and personality of an artist can alone be fully realised. Broad-casting will become the handmaiden rather than the usurping rival of literature and the arts in fact we feel justified in our opinion that in the long run art will not be injured by science, and that the printed page will not be displaced by the spoken word. Nor indeed can scientific ingenuity, which satisfies a laudable demand for recreation and study, be permanently withheld from the Public, for Broadcasting is not only an institution, but has become a necessity throughout the civilized world. This country cannot withhold privileges so widely enjoyed without restriction elsewhere.At the same time we should deprecate any cause for grievance amongst those who supply the raw material of Broadcasting, and we feel that services rendered to the Commissioners should be adequately rewarded. We hope the Commissioners will maintain and improve their service by allocating ample funds for meeting copyright royalties and for the adequate payment of performers. We can, however, see no adequate reason for withholding from the Commissioners all ordinary rights as regards the use of copyright material, whether in news or other-wise. On the other hand, we do not think it necessary to invest them with any special privilege or preference. Should claims or conditions considered by the Commissioners to be excessive, be made by owners of copyright, it is always open to them to refrain from using the material in question, and in some cases to establish alternative services for themselves. We expect these problems will accordingly solve themselves, and that experience will prove that apprehensions, though natural enough at present, will in the future be allayed.13. The Claims of Education. We are much impressed by-evidence reaching us from authoritative witnesses who advocated the vigorous and extended employment of broadcast for education in its widest and most liberal sense. Not only can listeners in general gather much knowledge from the intelligent study of broadcast matter, but broadcasting itself is an agency by which the teacher in the central studio can obtain direct access to the school itself. This has been achieved with notable success in the case of musical education, and we doubt not that in many other directions similar advantages will accrue. In addition to evidence of a general nature, the British Institute of Adult Education, and the representative of the National Federation of Women&apos;s Institutes, speaking for no less than 3,500 purely rural societies, have shown that a demand exists which deserves every encourage-ment. Although the number of listeners concerned may be relatively small compared with the total number of licensees, they deserve special assistance;   and we note that witnesses
have refrained from pressing their claim at the expense of the more popular types of programme. It is clear, however, that educational transmission may in existing circumstances have to give place to other items, and would suffer from such irregularity. A solution may possibly be found in the allocation of a special wave-length for a special subject, perhaps for several subjects, or again for a particular standard of a particular subject, such as music. Scientific and financial problems of magnitude are involved, upon which we offer no opinion; but, if circumstances permit, we should hope that the Commissioners will give early attention to this aspect of broadcasting, which will respond to better facilities and inure to public welfare. Meanwhile, we recommend the Postmaster-General to continue negotiations which we understand have recently been initiated in connection with a scheme for new high-power stations. It is to be hoped that there will be no hiatus or interruption during the transitional period, and that searching investigations will be continued, irrespective of the approaching end of the British Broadcasting Company&apos;s licence.14. High Standards Required. We are, of course, familiar with the inevitable criticism of the current programmes. Classical music depresses one section of listeners; the Jazz band exasperates a second; and a third desires greater immunity from each. In our opinion the British Broadcasting Company has held the balance between conflicting tastes with discretion. The listener is entitled to latitude. He must not be pressed to assimilate too much of what he calls &quot; highbrow &quot; broadcast, and the Commissioners would not be wise in transmitting more educational matter than licensees are prepared to accept. At the same time every effort must be made to raise the standard of style and performatice. Light music can be first-rate in quality and serious music can be extremely popular. We are assured by musicians, eminent in their art and versed in this very problem, that the gradual infusion of improved standards will be welcomed by listeners unconsciously at first, but with growing appreciation amongst those who will instinctively learn to desire better performances.Special wave-lengths or alternative services may provide an escape from the programme dilemma, but we trust they will never be used to cater for groups of listeners, however large, who press for trite and commonplace performances. The new authority, steadily, but with great patience, must try to improve the standard in each sphere of its activity, especially in music. We are confident that the fine record of Religious Services, to which a high tribute has been paid, will be jealously upheld in the future.15. Broadcasting Controversial Matter. We are unable to lay down a precise line of policy or to assess the degree to which argument   can   be   safely   transmitted.   In  the   absence   of
authoritative evidence such advice would be premature. but speaking generally, we believe that if the material be of high quality, not too lengthy or insistent, and distributed with scrupulous fairness, licensees will desire a moderate amount of controversy. But the discretion of the new authority must be upheld. Provided the Commission is strong and impartial, it will gradually assess the nature and extent of the demand: in this and in other problems to be solved the Commissioners will do well at the outset to act with firm and consistent circumspection.Broadcasting Parliamentary speeches, though parallel, raises a different group of issues on which we do not feel authorised to offer an opinion.16. Status of the Commission. We feel that the prestige and status of the Commission should be freely acknowledged and their sense of responsibility emphasised. We have framed our report with this object constantly in our minds, and we have done so with the knowledge that the State, through Parliament, must retain the right of ultimate control. We assume that the Postmaster-General would be the Parliamentary spokesman on broad questions of policy, though we think it essential that the Commission should not be subject to the continuing Ministerial guidance and direction which apply to Government Offices. The progress of science and the harmonies of art will be hampered by too rigid rules and too constant a supervision by the State. Within well-defined limits the Commission should enjoy the fullest liberty, wide enough to mark the serious duties laid upon it, and elastic enough to permit variation according to technical developments and changes in public taste. It would discourage enterprise and imtiative, both as regards experiments and the intricate problem of programmes, were the authority subjected to too much control. The aspirations and the public obligations of Broadcasting can best be studied by a body appointed ad hoc, endowed with adequate tenure, and concentrating on this particular duty. The Commissioners should therefore be invested with the maximum of freedom which Parliament is prepared to concede.17. We suggest that the Commission should present an annual report to Parliament.18. We endorse the clause relating to free licences for blind persons which the Government expressed its intention of accepting in connection with the Wireless Telegraphy and Signalling-Em, 1925.19. General Observations. Various suggestions have been made by witnesses, interesting and in some cases important, but they relate to subjects which the Commissioners will doubtless
consider in due course and in the normal fulfilment of their duties.   Among these matters are : (a) The proposal to allocate surplus funds to the promotion of British Opera.(6) The fact that for 10s. a year what are in effect large public concerts can be given daily, which is considered a grievance amongst those providing concerts which pay Entertainment Tax.(c) Oscillation and jamming.(d) International Broadcasting.(e) The question of advertising.(/) Journalism in relation to the Broadcasting service. (g) Education in the use of Receiving Sets. (A) Re-orchestration of music.(i) Reservation of certain periods for unofficial experimenters.Summary of Recommendations.20. Our principal recommendations are as follows : (a) That the broadcasting service should be conducted by a public corporation acting as Trustee for the national interest, and that its status and duties should correspond with those of a public service;(b) That the corporation should either be set up by Act of Parliament or be incorporated under the Companies Acts, limited by Guarantee, and dispensing with the word &quot; Limited&quot;; that in either case the corporation should hold the licence of the Postmaster-General for a period of not less than ten years;(c) That the corporation should be known as the &quot;British Broadcasting Commission&quot;; that it should consist of not more than seven or less than five Commis-sioners, all nominated by the Crown, the first Commissioners to hold office for five years ; that the Commissioners should be persons of judgment and independence, free of commit-ments, with business acumen and experienced in affairs; that one of the Commissioners might, if thought desirable, be one of the existing members of the British Broadcasting Company; that the Commissioners should have the power to appoint an Executive Commissioner with a seat on the Board; that all Commissioners should be adequately remunerated ;(d) That the Commissioners should appoint, in con-sultation with appropriate Societies and Organisations, a.s many Advisory Committees as are necessary to ensure due consideration of all phases of broadcasting;
(e) That the entire property and undertaking of the British Broadcasting Company as a going concern should be vested in the Commission on the 1st January, 1927 ; that all existing contracts and staff of the British Broad-easting Company should be taken over by the new Corn-mission ;(/) That the Postmaster-General should remain the licensing authority and be responsible for collecting the licence fees; that the detection and prosecution of those who conceal their equipment should be vigorously pursued ;(g) That the provision for experiment and research should be generous;(h) That the Commission should be empowered to raise capital;(i) That the fee of ten shilhngs for a receivers licence should be maintained; that the first charge on the Revenue from licence fees should be the expenditure incurred by the Postmaster-General in connection with the Broad-casting service; that after paying the Commissioners an income thoroughly adequate to enable them to ensure the full and efficient maintenance and development of the service, any surplus should be retained by the State ;(j) That the Commission^ accounts should be reviewed by the Comptroller and Auditor General;(k) That so soon as the licence expires or is withdrawn the Commission, on due provision being made for the discharge of all debts and liabilities, should be bound to transfer or dispose of its whole undertaking in such manner as the Postmaster-General may direct;(I) That the Commissioners should be entitled to all the ordinary rights as regards the use of copyright material  whether in news or otherwise and that it is unnecessary to invest them with any special privilege or preference;(to) That the claims of those listeners who desire a larger proportion of educational matter, though relatively few in number, should, if possible, be met;(n) That every effort should be made to raise the standard of style and performance in every phase of broad-casting and particularly in music ;(o) That a moderate amount of controversial matter should be broadcast, provided the material is of high quality and distributed with scrupulous fairness, and that the discretion of the Commissioners in this connection should be upheld;(p) That licences should be granted to blind persons free of charge;
(q) That the prestige and status of the Commission should be freely acknowledged and their sense of responsi-bility emphasised; that, although Parliament must retain the right of ultimate control and the Postmaster-General must be the Parliamentary Spokesman on broad questions of policy, the Commissioners should be invested with the maximum of freedom which Parliament is prepared to concede;(r) That the Commissioners should present an annual report to Parliament.21. We regret that owing to a severe illness our colleague. Mr. Rudyard Kipling, was obliged to resign his membership of the Committee at an early period of our enquiry. We likewise regret that Mr. Ian Macpherson, who had attended regularly, is also debarred by illness from helping us to prepare our report.22. We conclude by informing you that we are much indebted to the good offices of our Secretary, Mr. W. E. Weston.

The genesis of Broadcasting in Great Britain dates back to the summer of 1922 when, inspired by the popularity which it had attained in the United St;tse, some of the principal British, manufacturers of wireless apparatus approached the Post Office for permission to open a service in Great Britain.It was evident, not only on a priori grounds but from the reports of American experience, that to avoid mutual interference the number of transmitting stations would have to be strictly limited and subject to effective safeguards against abuse; and a monopoly in efficient hands seemed likely to provide the most successful service. The manufacturers were willing to subscribe the capital required, which might not have been forthcoming from other sources, they were prepared to conduct the service without cost to the taxpayer, and they had at their disposal technicians of the highest order; moreover, as their profits would depend on the sale of receiving apparatus, it would be in their interests to stimulate the demand by providing attractive programmes and catering for all classes of the community.
2. i?or these reasons it was decided to enter into negotiations with the manufacturers, and after considerable discussion an agreement was reached, the more important provisions of which may be summarised as follows : (a) The manufacturers to form a Company (named the British Broadcasting Company) to provide the necessary capital, to establish and operate eight Broadcasting stations in Great Britain and to transmit daily from each station programmes to the satisfaction of the Postmaster-General.(5) Any manufacturer of wireless apparatus in Great Britain to be eligible for membership of the Company on acquiring one or more  1 shares and subscribing to an agreement approved, by the Postmaster-General.(c) The agreement to bind the member to sell only apparatus manufactured in Great Britain of a type approved by the Postmaster-General and bearing the B.B.C. mark, and to pay the Company royalty on apparatus sold by him according to a scale scheduled in the agreement.(d) The Company&apos;s dividends to be limited to 1\ per cent, per annum (cumulative) on the paid-up capital.(e) The Postmaster-General to issue Broadcast Licences at a fee of not less than 10s. and to pay the Company half the proceeds ; the licence to include a condition that the apparatus authorised for use under it should bear the B.B.C. mark.(/) The agreement with the Company to extend to December 31st, 1924, i.e., for approximately two years.The agreement was finally executed on January 18th, 1923, but Broadcasting was actually opened, on provisional permission from the Postmaster-General, in November 1922.3. The scheme had the advantage that it tided over the initial period when the finance of Broadcasting was highly speculative and established a. system under the best technical auspices with a guarantee of adequate -financial, backing by responsible firms and a strict limitation of the operating Companys profits. It was not intended to be more than a temporary arrangement, and. the currency of the licence was deliberately limited to two years, in order that the organisation might be open to review when sufficient practical experience had been acquired.4. As a quid pro quo for shouldering the financial risks the manufacturers claimed some measure of protection against foreign imported apparatus, particularly on the ground that it was by their own efforts and their own capital that the demand was created. It was known that the Broadcasting boom in the United States had resulted in over-production and it was reported that large quantities of apparatus manufactured both in the United States and in Europe for the American market were awaiting the inauguration of the Broadcasting service to be dumped in Great Britain. On these grounds the Government agreed to the protective provisions in the Licence as a temporary expedient to be terminated when the industry bad become established.5. It was recognised that provision would have to be included in the scheme for persons desiring to construct their own apparatus, and it was thought that anyone who was competent to make his own set would possess technical knowledge to justify the issue of an experimental licence, which was granted at the same fee (10s.) as the broadcast licence, but was free from any condition as to origin or B.B.C. marking. But difficulties soon appeared owing to the market being flooded with com-ponent parts, which could be assembled in complete sets by persons without any technical knowledge or experience whatever. The component parts were frequently imported from abroad, were free from the B.B.C, royalty and were much cheaper than the complete apparatus sold by
the British trader. The purchasers intended merely to receive the broadcast programmes and had neither the wish nor the qualifications to conduct experiments. To treat such persons as experimenters would obviously have been an absurdity and would have made the Post Office a party to what was simply an attempt to evade the conditions of the B.B.C. agreement. On the other hand, numbers of persons refused or omitted to take out licences because they were not qualified for an experimental licence, while the apparatus which they used would not. comply with the conditions of a broadcast licence.6. In view of these difficulties the Postmaster-General appointed a Committee, under the Chairmanship of Sir Frederick Sykes in April 1923 to consider the position. The Committee recommended, inter alia, that the licensing scheme should be altered in the following directions : (a) A single form of receiving licence to be issued at 10s. per annum, of which 7s. (id. should be paid to the B.B.C.(6) The conditions as to British origin and marking of apparatus to be withdrawn and the system of royalties to be abandoned.(c) The B.B.C.&apos;s licence to be extended for a. period of two years, i.e. until 31st December, 1926.7. It was recognised that the agreement between the Post Office and the B.B.C. could only be modified with the assent of the latter, and the Committee apparently hoped that the extension of their licence for two years, combined with an increase from 5s. to 7s. Gd. in the Company&apos;s proportion of the licence fee, would suffice to induce them to waive their protective rights as to foreign apparatus.8. The Company, however, refused to waive their rights on these terms, and after negotiation the following compromise was accepted : (1) The Company&apos;s licence to be extended to the 31st December, 1926.(2) During the period up to 31st December, 1924, licences in two forms to be issued (a) a broadcast licence at 10s., of which 7s. Gd. was to be paidto the Company, covering only the use of apparatus bearing the B.B.C. mark, and(b) a constructor^ licence at 15s. of which the Company wereto receive 12s. Gd., the licensee giving an undertaking that in constructing his apparatus he would not knowingly use apparatus manufactured, elsewhere than in Great Britain.(3) The scale of royalty payable to the Company by its members to be reduced.(4) As from the 1st January, 1925 (a) A single form of broadcast licence to be issued at 10s.(6) The proportion of the licence fee payable to the Company to be reduced, if the Company&quot;s finances permitted, according to a sliding scale based upon the Company&apos;s expenditure and the number of licences issued.(c) The royalty system, the protection against foreign apparatus and the stipulation as to B.B.C. marking to be discontinued.This compromise was embodied in a Supplementary Agreement with the B.B.C. and took effect as from the 1st October, 1923.9. The growth in the number of licences enabled the constructor^ licence to be dropped and the uniform 10s. licence to be introduced, with the concurrence and, indeed, at the suggestion of the Company, on July 1st, 1924, i.e. six months earlier than the Agreement provided for.
II. The Development of Broadcasting.10. The following summary indicates the principal developments of Broadcasting since the service was opened in 1922.The original licence to the B.B.C. contemplated the construction of eight broadcasting stations, to which the Company have since added (a) A new main station (1  kilowatts) at Belfast. (&amp;) 11 relay stations (each of 200 watts).(c) A new high power station at Daventry of 25 kilowatts, working on a wave-length of 1600 metres. These additional stations have enormously increased the proportion of the population who can receive the broadcast programmes by means of a simple crystal set.   A list of the authorised Broadcasting stations with dates of opening is given below.11. The policy of simultaneous broadcasting by means of trunk telephone lines has been adopted and gradually extended so that selected items of the programmes emitted from any station can now be relayed to any other station in Great Britain.&quot; Outside broadcasts,&quot; i.e., the direct transmission of such items as speeches, plays, concerts, &amp;c, as distinct from performances at the studios, have been instituted.At the same time the B.B.C. have carried out a wide range of experimental work with technical apparatus.12. A statement showing the number of receiving licences issued at various dates is attached. At the end of January 1926 licences current numbered slightly over 1,840,000, although, owing to legal difficulties, the Post Office have only recently been in a position to prosecute defaulters.British Broadcastzng Company&apos;s Stations.Town.
