Percentage of unemployment (Great Britain) in the insured industries at the end of February 1924.    .... .... .... ....   10*5.1925     .... .... .-.   H&apos;l1926    .................   10-2The number of persons on the registers on the 22nd February, 1926, as will be seen from Table (A) above, shows a decrease of 75,067 over the position on the 25th January, 1926. This reduction is most marked amongst men and may be attributed chiefly to an increase in activity in the principal seasonal trades.A comparison of the analysis of the position on the 25th February as given in Table (B) above, with that on the 25th January, 1926, shows that there has been a decrease of 66,527 in the number of persons described as wholly unemployed and that this accounts for almost nine-tenths of the reduction in the total figures. It is noteworthy also that a net increase of 7,456 in the number of casual workers unemployed has taken place during the month.(C.) Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 22nd February, 1926, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 10&apos;5, as compared with 11*1 at the 25th January, 1926, with 1P3 at the 23rd February, 1925, and with 10&apos;6 at the 25th February, 1924.The figures at the 22nd February, 1926, in respect of industries showing appreciable variations in unemployment during the period, together with the increase or decrease as compared with the previous month and with a year ago, are given in the table below: Industry.Building-Tailoring Coal-miningPublic Works Contracting, &amp;c.

(D.)-Latest Figures.The latest figures of unemployment published are those for the 15th March, giving the total number on the registers as 1,070,800. The decrease over the position at the 8th March amounts to 23,282, and over a year ago to 148,406. A comparison of the latest figures with the position on the 21st December, 1925, shows that the whole of the ground lost since that date has been recovered.A. STEEL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,March 24, 1926.The only important Industry in which a marked decrease in employment was evident is the Cotton Industry, where short-time working has been very prevalent. The position among Dock Labourers also showed signs of some decline.Compared with a year ago the industrial position is decidedly better. Coal-mining, Engineering, the Iron and Steel Trades are industries which show the most marked signs of improvement, whilst in the Textile Trades in general, Building, Marine Engineering and the Shipbuilding Industries the unemployment position is somewhat less satisfactory.
