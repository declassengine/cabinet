3 DCCUMENT IS THE PRCFERTY CF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3  GOVERNMENT)COPYJNoi^CABINET REPORT OF THE COAL COMMISSION. PossibTo methods of applying a^digdnIshiixg aubsidy. Memorandum by the Sec; net any for Mines .With wages at their present level, there is in each of the principal districts an adverse gap between proceeds and costs of production, If with the latter is included provision for a reasonable profit.    In all except one there is an adverse gap even if no provision is made at all for profits. The gap is now being filled by subsidy.    If wagos were to   . remain at their present level, and subsidy were tn be with-drawn or diminished, the whole of the burden thus created would obviously fall upon the owners,    The Commission recommended that it should fall, in part at any rate,  on tho men,    The crucial question is for the owners and men to determine,  in each district, the extent  (as measured in reduction of wages) to which it is to fall on the men. Until that Is done there can be no question of tapering the . subsidy,  since the owners would refuse to continue the present wages on such conditions.    To contemplate  (as certain newspapers seem to do) tapering the subsidy while negotiations are going on is completely to misconceive the .position.If it comes eventually to giving a tapering subsidy, all sorts of questions of detail will have to be considered into- which It would be a waste of time to enter now.    WhatSee table annexed.
-    - g -is to be considered the gap?    Is it to include provision for profit  (as the subsidy does at present)  or to exclude it? On what period is it ta bo calculated?    Is the owners&apos; sacrifice to be eased or only the men&apos;s?    For hor long Is the tapering process to last?YJhatever may be the answers to these questions, the main principles ^hat must in any case govern a tapering subsidy can be illustrated very simply by the following examples, in which It i.-i assumed that the present adverse gap in a particular district is equivalent  (in terms of wages) to 2/- a shift and that the subsidy is to last for three months and taper by uniform monthly stages.    It is assumed,  too, that the present- system of treating all collieries within each district alike would be continued, for, as the Commission point out,  &quot;it would be impossible to frame any scheme drawing a line between collieries that should receive a subsidy and those that should not,, which would not be open to insuperable objections.&quot; Case I.  Owners and men agree to make equal sacrifice..    The friges are to come down 1/- a shift; the rest of tho loss is to be born3 by the owners as best they mayu    The Government decide to taper the sacrifice of both.    Then the course of the subsidy will be as follows:	Rate per shift below the present guaranteed rate at which		Rate por shift of subsidy	The men will receive Yirages	The owners will pay wages	May	3d.
