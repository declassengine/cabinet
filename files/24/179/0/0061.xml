E C R E T.CABINET..P.  161(26).INTERNATIONAL HOURS OF WORK.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I have very carefully read and considered the Minister of Labour&apos;s memorandum of the 29th March (C.p. 137 (56)).I have always been of the opinion that sooner or later we should have to lead the world in the ratification of the Washington Convention, and I have assented to the proposal of my colleague the Minister of Labour to discuss with his colleagues of some of the principal nations the interpretations to be placed upon certain doubtful terms of the Washington Convention.    What, however,  is now the position?   Five nations have agreed upon what they think to be the interpretation of certain hitherto uncertain clauses of the Washington Convention and it is suggested that we amongst others should introduce legislation to give effect to the provisions - so interpreted -of a Convention which is not yet ratified.What, moreover, is the position of the League of Nations? There are some 50 nations who belong to the League and who may possibly be assenting parties to the Washington Convention. At all events there were some forty nations at the Conference which adopted the Convention.    What right have five nations to interpret this Convention?    It will be noted that the United States, all the South American States,  Spain and all the Eastern States of Europe, are not parties to this latest interpretation conference.    I suggest to my colleagi es that the proper course is that the Minister of Labour should announce to the four other Governments with whom he conferred that we accept the interpretations arrived at for the purpose of submitting them to the League of Nations for embodiment in an addendum to the Washington Convention.
-2-700i notice that the Minister of Labour appears to desire to link up the London agreement with the Washington Convention in some way through the International Labour Office, but as a matter of fact the Convention arose out of the Peace Treaty before the International Labour Office was founded and it would be most undesirable to give the latter body any power in regard to the interpretation of the Washington Convention.The suggestion that legislation should be at once introduced to carry out these interpretations containing a clause that they are not to be put into operation until other nations do so would I fear cause grave anxiety in the industrial world here.    Nobody, neither the employer nor employed, would know when the new hours were to be effected and I think the Trades Union would very soon say &quot;Here is an Act of Parliament. The Conservative Government passed it and. therefore agrees with it;    we won&apos;t wait for Italy to carry out these terms,  still less will we bother about the other nations who were not parties to this conference.    Let us have our 48 hours immediately&quot;A further point appears to be an impression that some people think that the carrying out of the terms of this conference by&quot;, law would obviate some of my troubles in the Factory Bill but I am afraid this is not so.    The Factory Bill deals with female and child labour and in no case with the hours of adult male labour.    That has never been the policy of Factory Acts since they were first passed.    if,  however,  an Act of Parliament passes a 48 hour Bill for adults I will still have to pass a Factory Bill modifying those decisions so far as they relate to women and young people.    For instance, my protegees cannot begin before certain hours in the morning and must finish at certain hours at night, whereas the adult male may apparently be permitted to work his eight hours at any time during the twenty-four,  and in fact he does at the present time.W.J.H.20th April,   1926.V35-6
