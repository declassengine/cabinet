(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government).SECRET. 748JTT CABINET.0.P1166   (26). &quot;jADVERTISEMENT REGULATION BYELAWS.Memorandum by tho Home Secretary.In view of the attack which was made in the House of Lords on the 24th March on the Home Office administration of the Advertisements Regulation Act of last Session, and which was taken up in a Leader in the &quot;Times&quot;  on Monday, the 29th March, I wish to let my colleagues know exactly what the position is.The gist of tho attack was, in Lord Newton&apos;s words, that &quot;The Home Office by its instruction has completely nullified the operation of the Act&quot; and in Lord Crawford&apos;s words that &quot;Since the Act was passed last year county after county has found itself not merely discouraged but estopped from putting what they consider to be the plain meaning of the law into effect&quot; .   &quot; Lord Crawford also remarked that &quot;The County Councils and their Association have been in communication with the -Home Office and have failed to get any satisfaction&quot;. Those  statements are misleading and unfair.The facts are these - The Act of last Session gave power to local authorities to make byelaws &quot;for regulating, restricting, or preventing within their.district or any part thereof the exhibition of advertisements so as to disfigure br injuriously affect(a) the view of rural  scenery from a highway or railwayor from any public place or water, or(b) the amenities cf any village within the district ofa rural district council, or(c) the amenities of any historic or public building ormonument or any place frequented by the public solely or chiefly on account of its beauty or historic interest.&quot;
-2- 749Three county councils, Norfolki Kent and Westmorland, submitted for my approval draft byelaws in the following form &apos; (which I will refer to in this memorandum as the Norfolk form) i-&quot;No person shall erect or exhibit or permit or cause to be erected or exhibited any advertisement if such advertisement(a) disfigures or injuriously affects the view of ruralscenery from a highway or railway or from any public place or water,(b) disfigures the natural beauty of any landscape,(c) affects injuriously the amenities of any villagewithin the district of a rural district council,(d) disfigures or injuriously affects the amenities ofany historic or public building,   o.&quot; The byelaws were to apply generally throughout the county. Exceptions were made for certain classes of advertisements, such as advertisements relating to a business carried on on the premises, local entertainments, auctions, &amp;c.It will be observed that these byelaws in substance merely incorporated the general words of the Act.      For reasons which I will go into presently, I came to the conclusion that they were not byelaws which could properly be made under the Act, and that apart from technical objections, they would work unfairly and would be extremely difficult to enforce.On the passing of the Act my Department most carefully examined the question of the lines on which byelaws could be framed with the anxious desire to give the fullest possible effect to the intentions of Parliament, and to assist the local authorities in framing proposals for my consideration. It is the usual procedure of the Home Office, when an Act is passed giving new powers of making byelaws, to issue a circular explaining the Act and suggesting model forms for the use of local authorities, and this procedure was followed in the present case.     A copy of the Home Office circular and model form of byelaws which accompanied it is attached.The allegation made by Lord Newton in his speech in the
House of Lords that &quot;the Home Office was unfriendly to the Bill&quot; was an unjustifiable statement to make.     A comparison of the model byelaws issued &quot;by the Home Office with the Norfolk form of &quot;byelaws which have the  support of Lord Newton and &quot;Scapa&quot; will show in my opinion that so far from preventing effect being given to the provisions of the Act the Home Office forms of byelaw will operate for the prevention of unsightly advertise-ments more effectively and rapidly than the other forms.      I will take first, as this is the most important part of the question, the protection of the rural areas.     Compare No. 1 of the Home Office forms which deals with purely rural areas with the first part of the Norfolk byelaw.      The Home Offico form absolutely prohibits the exhibition of advertisements in specified areas by the side or within view of highways, railways and public places, the areas specified being selected on the ground of their being areas of rural scenery which should be protected from unsightly advertisements.     All that is required of the local authority is that it should make a selection of the rural districts or areas which deserve a complete measure of protection.      The areas selected may be large or small according to the character of the county.      The Norfolk form of byelaw on the other hand contains no absolute prohibition at all.      It only operates to prohibit the exhibition of an advertisement which disfigures the view of the rural scenery from a highway, &amp;c.      The question whether the exhibition of a particular advertisement in a particular district will disfigure the views in that district is not determined by the byelaw as under the Home Office forms, but is left an open question on which a decision can only be obtained by taking the matter before a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. It seems obvious, quite apart from other objections to this form of byelaw,  that it leaves the door open to endless disputes, for a great expenditure of timo and money if the local authority is energetic and for the more or less extensive disregard of the byelaw if the local authority is not energetic and for a great
-4- 751diversity of practice in different parts of the country. The Home Office form on the other hand itself determines the question whether advertisements may or may not be erected in a particular district and is capable of immediate and effective application;      If there is any ground on which objection could be taken to the Home Office form,  it would rather be that the byelaw is too effective, too drastic, but I think the country Is prepared for a big forward step in this direction.Objections were taken in the House of Lords and in the &quot;Times&quot; Article to the Home Office forms on several grounds. One was that they excluded semi-rural areas from protection. This is a complete mistake and shows that those who have taken the objection have not read the Home Office circular with any attention.     Views of rural scenery in districts of mixed urban and rural character are of course entitled to be protected, but they cannot be protected in the manner indicated in No. 1 of the Home Office model forms, which are only applicable to districts or areas which are wholly rural throughout.      They would require to be dealt with in a different way.     No. 3 of the Home Office models has been framed for this purpose,and could be used in many cases and there are also the powers in the earlier Act of 1907 for the protection of parks,&apos; particular views and the like.      Another objection was that the County Councils would be put to the trouble of making a survey of their whole county in order to decide what districts could properly be scheduled and it has been suggested that a county council might have great difficulty in discriminating between one district and another.      I think it was the intention of Parliament that the county councils should exercise their discretion in the matter, otherwise there  is little or no point in giving them the power to make byelaws, but a council is at liberty to schedule all the rural areas within its boundaries,  if it thinks fit, and if their action appears to be prima facie
reasonable and no objections are raised by other parties, the Home Office would certainly not take any objection to their doing so.      I have so informed the Norfolk County authorities and Westmorland is in fact proposing to do so. Of course if objections are taken, it will be my duty under the provisions of the Act to inquire into them and I should propose to appoint a Commissioner to hold a local inquiry on the spot.Admittedly, the task of eliminating disfiguring advertisements from our country-side is not an easy matter. A local authority which desires to bring this about within its boundaries cannot expect to do so without taking some little trouble about it.      The question of disfigurement would in many cases be a question of taste, about which different persons and, I may say, different Benches of Magistrates would take different views.     It is claimed for the Norfolk form of bye law that it enables a county council to make a scheme for the whole of its county at once and to bring the Act into operation without delay, but as I have shown above, this result may be very largely illusory. Nothing is finally determined by the Norfolk form of byelaw.The protection of the amenities of rural villages, buildings or places of historic interest, monuments, public buildings and beauty spots is the second part of the question. Here again it seems to me the Home Office forms, besides being in accord with what I believe to have been the intention of the Act, present a decided advantage.     Under them the local authority will specify the villages, buildings and places to be protected and the byelaws will operate tc prevent absolutely the exhibition of advertisements in their vicinity (subject to certain recognised exceptions).      This may seem a cumbersome method so far as rural villages are concerned,  in view of the number which deserve protection, and this is one of the objections taken to the Home Office forms.      I anticipate, however, that villages will to a
great extent be protected, without specific mention, by the byelawe (in model form No. l) for the protection of rural areas *      So far as historic buildings or places, public buildings &amp;c. are concerned, I think that no method other than that of specifying them is possible.      The Norfolk form leaves the whole matter entirely vague.     Who will be able to tell what are the public buildings to which the byelaw applies?     Is an isolation hospital or a poor law institution or a primary school a public building whose amenities require that no advertisement shall be erected near them?     I could never have advised the Cabinet to have accepted the Bill of last year if I had understood that it would have been interpreted as allowing the vague prohibition appearing in the Norfolk form of byelaw.&apos;I have sc far considered the Norfolk forms of byelaw which Lord Newton and Lord Crawford and &quot;scapa&quot; are upholding and the Home Office forms from the point of view of their practical working.      I must now refer to the very serious objections which can be taken to the Norfolk form of byelaw on legal grounds.      No rule of law is better established as regards the making of byelaws than this - that a byelaw must be certain, that is, that it must indicate definitely to those who are affected by it what they must or must not do.      This is just what the Norfolk form of byelaw does net do..    It does not tell the would-be advertiser where he must not place his advertisement.      It gives him no guidance in the matter at all.      If he puts the advertisement in a position where the local authority, or any private individual for that matter, considers that it is disfiguring to or injuriously affects the view of some rural scenery or the amenities of some village or some public building, he is liable to be summoned before a Court of Summary Jurisdiction to have the question determined.      The uncertainty will be specially acute  in areas of a mixed character, partly rural and partly urban.      There is another important consideration,
a Court of Summary Jurisdiction appears to me to be a quite unsuitable body   for determining the question which would be left to it to determine under the Norfolk form of byelaw.    The Courts would have no definite standard of any kind to guide them, their decisions would be largely based on the individual prepossessions and possibly interests of the persons who compose the Court for the time being, and quite different views are likely to be taken by Courts in different parts of the country.      Of course, in certain instances, such as that of the huge advertisements on the Sussex Downs near Brighton, which was the subject of a recent case, there is not likely to be any difficulty, but these are the exceptional oases.      It is in the numberless cases of an ordinary kind where difficulties would arise.      I cannot think that this is a proper duty to place upon the Courts.Lastly, under the Norfolk form the discretion of the Secretary of State as the confirming authority is, for all practical purposes, eliminated.I would only add that under the interpretation given by Lord Newton and &quot;scapa&quot; to the Act, there is no obvious reason why Parliament should have introduced a byelaw making power at all, as the byelaws they wish to see made merely repeat the words of the Act and only add to them certain exceptions of a well recognised character.      The obvious course to take,  if that was the intention of Parliament, and one which would have saved everyone a great deal of trouble, would have been to have made the Act a substantive enactment prohibiting the exhibition of advertisements on the lines indicated.      Certainly neither I, nor my Department, had any idea that this was in the minds of the promoters, with whom the subject-has been frequently discussed.I do not think the protests of Lord Newton and Lord Crawford need be taken too seriously.      The matter has beon absurdly exaggerated by them.     The protests from the counties
.4.26.. I       jl -8- !to which Lord Crawford refers have so far not reached me. The position at the present moment is that three counties submitted byelaws in the Norfolk form before the Home Office circular and models were issued, and that six local authorities have since submitted byelaws in tho Home Office forms.      I see from the press that the County Councils Association at their meeting adopted a resolution on the subject and appointed a deputation to wait upon me.      I shall, of course, be prepared to see the deputation and discuss the matter with them - and if any alterations or improvements can. be suggested^ in the Home Office forms whioh are not opon to the same objections as the Norfolk forms, I shall be ready to accept them.W.J.H.
Any communication on the subject of this letter should be addressed to The Under Secretary of State, Home Office,London, S.w. i. and the following number quoted : 482&quot;, 642/32HOME OFFICE,WHITEHALL.18th December, 1925,Sir,Advertisements Regulation Act, 1925..As numerous local authorities desire to avail themselves of the new-powers of making byelaws under the Advertisements Regulation Act, 1925, for the prevention and restriction of disfiguring advertisements, the Secretary of State has caused model forms of byelaws to be prepared, and he directs me to enclose a copy   for the guidance of your Council in the event of your Council seeking to avail themselves of the powers given by the Act.The Act gives power to protect from disfiguring advertisements(l) the view of rural scenery from a highway or railway or from any public place or water;(2) the amenities of any village within the district of a rural districtoounoil;(3) the amenities of historic or public buildings,  etc.The Secretary of State has given careful consideration to the question what forms of byelawa he can properly allow under these powers.     So far as byelaws under headings (2) and (3) are concerned he does not foresee any special difficulty.      The particular villages, buildings, etc. to be protected must be specified in the byelaws,  and subject to certain necessary exceptions, he thinks it will be proper and in accordance with the intention of the Act to allow the prohibition of all advertisements in or in the immediate vicinity of these selected places.Byelaws- under heading (l) present greater difficulty.     The words &quot;view of rural scenery&quot;  are much wider than the words which appear in the Act of 1907 - &quot;natural beauty of a landscape&quot;.     On the one hand any byelaws made must be definite in character,  so that persons who may be affected by them may be left in no doubt as to the places to which the byelaws apply and how far the exhibition of advertisements in those places is prohibited.      On the othor hand, it will be practically impossible at any rate extremely oumbrous and inconvenient to all parties, to schedule long lists of views of rural scenery which it is desirable to protect.        The Secretary of State is prepared to act on the view that Parliament intended that a wide measure of protection from advortise-ments should be given to country scenery,  and that it would be a proper procedure for the local authority to schedule areas (whether by rnral districts,  parishes or otherwise) which they regard and can defend as genuinelyThe Clerk of the County Council.
rural and suitable for protection in accordance with the intentions of the Act.In such areas the exhibition of any advertisement by the side or within view ofany highway, railways public place or public water would be prohibited, subjectto certain exceptions.     The model byelaws which are enclosed with this circularare framed on these lines.      It will be necessary,  of course, that the localauthority should exercise a reasonable discretion in selecting the areas forgeneral protection and the Secretary of State will have to consider carefullyany objections that may be taken to the local authorities proposals.     Areas ofa semi-rural character should not be included and if they contain views of ruralscenery which it is desired to protect it will be necessary to schedule the viewsspecifically or b3&apos; reference to particular roads, parts of roads &amp;o. - seeByelaw 3.    As such areas are of less importance than purely rural areas the Secretaryof State recommends that in the first instance attention should be confined toscheduling the latter.The suggestion has been made that byelaws might be made which would simply omtody the terms of section l(l) of the Act and apply them to the whole of the area of the local authority subject to exemptions for certain olasses of advertisements. This would, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, be contrary to the intention cf Parliament, and it would be open to the serious objection that persons affected would not know where or where not they might exhibit an advertisement,  as the decision in each case whether a view of rural sDenery was disfigured would, under byelaws framed in this way, rest with the courts and could only be determined by actual proceedings,      Byelaws framed in this way would also be difficult to enforce and might give rise to numerous disputes.Byelaws should, in accordance with the usual practice be submitted to the Secretary of State in draft for provisional approval before being formally adopted by the Council.      It will not,  however,  bo possible for the Department to undertake any detailed examination of the proposals so far as regards the areas, views, buildings &amp;c to he scheduled.      If after the byelaws have been formally adopted and published in th manner prescribed by the Order of the Seoretary of State,  objections to the byelaws which seem to be of importance are received by the Secretary cf State, the course he vrculd propose to adopt would be to cause a local inquiry to be held in pursuance of section 3(3) of the Act cf 1907 by a Commissioner appointed by him.for the purpose. It will be very desirable, therefore, that in order to avoid as much as possible the need for a local inquiry and -the consequent expense, the proposals submitted should have boon very oarefully considered.The Secretary of State desires me also to draw attention to Section 2 cf the Act which authorises a county council to arrange with any rural distriot oounoil for tho delegation to that council of the power of enforcing any byelaws made by the county council.      In this connection the Secretary of State desires mo to state that when the Act was under consideration in Standing Committee in the House of Commons, an amendment was moved on behalf of the Rural District Councils Association, which would have required a County Council to comply with any request from a rural district council for tho delegation of such powers, but the amendment was withdrawn on an undertaking being given on behalf of the Secretary of State that he would consider the question of placing before County Councils the desirability of acceding to such a demand in the absence of very grave reasons to the contrary.
The Secretary of State does not anticipate that any difficulty will ordinarily arise, in the matter-, and he feels sure that., if a request in pursuance of Section 2 of the Act is made to them by any Rural District council, the County Council will not refuse to accede to it without very careful consideration of all the circumstances.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant
