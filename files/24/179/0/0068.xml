LORD WEIR:      Mr. Prime Minister, my first duty is      P to say to you and your colleagues how much we appreciate your readiness to receive us and at the same time I wish to say how much I regret that our Chairman, llr. Evan Williams, has been unable to lead the deputation because of the claims made on him by the mining negotiations.     Ho one regrets his absence more than I do having to take his place at very short notice and the fact that the deputation is larger than usual from the Confederation is perhaps some evidence of the strong support I am held to require.      In these matters I am going to try and be as brief as possible but it will take a little timecOur objective tonight is to indicate in the first place our ever increasing anxiety in regard to the extent and the duration of the depression in the export trade; next the continued lack of any general national effort of policy leading to better conditions and in view of these grave questions the positive alarm that the Confederation feel at the conclusions and the implications of the recent Conference on Hours held in London.     At all our meetings with you and your colleagues and in all our evidence before the Royal and other &quot;Commissions recently we have consistently drawn attention to tho grave position of the staple export industries and to their inability to carry the burdens resting on therru    Now recently the Government have made it clear that the annual budget of 800 millions must be faced for some time to come and to keep within that the Economy Bill has been introduced.      The Confederation does not object to that Bill but it would point out that the Bill appropriates money which we think available for reduction In contribution and. it anticipates as far as the State is concerned the solvency of the Unemployment Insurance Fund and it thereby post-
pones the dote when industry car obtain the further relief in that direction which it wra led to expect so that apparently we cannot look forward with any great hope to relief in these burdensome directions0     How when I speak of depressed industry i want to avoid any exaggeration or under-estimation.      In many directions the oerformance of the country has been very wonderful.      We have paid our war debts and we bear the burdens of the debts of others.      That is a severe strain.    So has been the return to the gold standard, but in spite of that  strain we have provided for the work-people earnings representing in the main a higher purchasing power than in pre-war days and you have provided the most complete system of social service that has ever been seen. Now as I say those are great performances, taut it is the other  side of the picture we think of ard we think of  it in terms of national waste, human misery and demoralisation, and that is the unemployment figures,      how I do not require to go over these figures because you know them very well. I am only going to use one and that is, the average unemploy-ment figure    from the beginning of this year to date despite the incidence of the coal subsidy is fully as great  as the average figure for the whole of 1924.      Now to complete that human side of the picture.      In December last in England and Wales alone there were more than a million men, women and children drawing outdoor Poor Law relief and that number which ha d/incr eased from month to month is higher than at any time since July 1923.     Now when you come to thematerial sides I will only give what we think is the gravest manifestation of all and that is that the total productivity of the country measured by any available test appears to be from ten to twenty per cent less than it was twelve years ago notwithstanding the fact that possibly there are as many as 400,000 more people working today
than in pre-war days.      Mow that  is a picture very brief of the facts which cause us anxiety and concern, ever increas-ing anxiety and in our view the only useful remedial policy which may be very hard to find will be one which aims at achieving through a concentration of national effort increased production of our goods at such a cost as will enable these depressed industries to regain and to maintain their foreign markets,      Wow in any effort of that nature one of the essentials for success must in our opinion be the minimum interference by the State with the details of industrial conditions and it is with the broad picture that I have sketched and with this latter point in view that I come to our main objective today and that is to submit to you the considered view of the Confederation on the conclusions of the London Conference on Hours,,      Now on the eve of this Conference the Confederation was assured by the Minister of Labour that his sole object was to assist British industry and it  is by that test and by that test only that we must judge the conclusions,      Now I rgret to say that applying that test It is the deliberate and considered view of the Confederation that the Conclusions of the Conference will not only fail to bring any assistance to British industrial conditions,  but that these conclusions if given effect to will definitely further handicap the Industries and the former  status quo in the form of competing countries will more or less remain unaltered.      Now let me give you some reasons why we hold that strong view - I am trying to avoid details because it is a very complicated subject - but there are quite a number of points of importance.      First of all the Confederation clearly understood from the Minister1s letter to it of January 1926 that it was not the Washington Convention which he had in view,  but some
agreement which would introduce uniformity 0f actual practice in competing countries.      However,, in February we received a copy of the Minister&apos;^ letter of the previous June convening the Conference and we then realised the Conference must revolve round Washington and Washington alone and we did not fail to bring to the notice of the Minister the danger of that situation.     Now in his memoran-dum to us in March the Minister&apos; detailed various points which would arise for agreement and I want to deal with the more important of these,      The first one which Sir Arthur described as necessary was the fixing of a maximum number of hours which might be worked for any reason other than breakdowns in addition to the 48 per week-  in short, an international maximum of overtime hours.     Now the conclusions of the Conference have left that question exactly where the vvashington Convention left it with each country free to fix what maximum it pleases so long as it is fixed by the State.     Any object.,- therefore, which the Minister had of securing a uniform maximum of actual working hours has not matured.      Now the next point, agree-ment upon which was described by the Minister as indispensable-sable was the defining of the exceptional cases of pressure of work which would justify the working of additional hours beyond the 48,      The Conference again leaves this vital matter where the Washington Convention left it, each country free to do as it pleases so long as the State regulates.      In regard to that point the Minister pointed out if foreign countries were permitted to continue to interpret these words  Exceptional cases of pressure of work&apos;  as  justifying ordinary commercial overtime the object  of the Washington Convention would be defeated. There is nothing in the conclusions of the Conference to prohibit foreign countries from continuing their present
practice, but if the v,-eshIngto&apos;h Corn-exit ion were ratified by Great Britain British Trades Unions are quite strong enough to see to it that the strictest possible interpretation of these words is secured in Greet Britain end that the object of the Washington Convention would not be defeated in this country.      flow a further point which the Minister considered as essential was the scheduling in advance of the various continuous processes in which 06 hours could be worked instead of 48o      The Conference makes no reference to continuous processes and once again the various countries are free to make their own arrangements.      How I come to one of the most important points of all.      It is  quite clear and has been clear to every  one who had studied the hours problem that quite apart from a common.interpretation that any international arrangement aiming at uniform practice must envisage and provide for effective enforcement of that uniform law.      Now this vital point was placed by Sir Arthur in the very forefront of his programme from the beginning and it was repeatedly emphasised by him to the Confederation. The conclusions of the Conference make no reference whatever to enforcing it.      How prime Minister these pointsjare not exhaustive, but I think they serve to illustrate how far the conclusions of the Conference are in accord with what the Minister of Labour set out to dc      In the House of Commons on the 9th Apr.il the Minister of Labour made this statement:&quot;Neither the present nor any preceding Government has found it possible to frame a Bill which will conform to the terms of the Washington Convention in its present  form and which will not involve the abrogation of existing agreements in important industries and gravely impair if not Destroy tnat elasticitv of reasonable freedom of self-government which both employers and employed in British industries should rightly prise&quot;.In this country when new legislation is needed we carry
that legislation first of all and we ratify afterwards. That is not the universal practice elsewhere.     you cannot put the existing life of the country into the strait-jacket which that particular Convent ion would provide. &apos;   The conclusions of the London Conference have in our considered opinion not only failed to secure even the basis of a uniform practice in competing countries,  but they have left unsolved all the domestic difficulties which as the Minister explained beset the question and its application in this country.      Now the Confederation has consistently pointed out that in an exporting country like ours where collective agreements operate and where the workers actually enjoy shorter hours of work than in any country in the world the agitation for the ratification of the Washington Convention is purely political.      The  Labour Government Bill of 1924 never reached its second reading. It seems almost incredible that industry which was paved from that Bill and its consequences through the defeat of the Labour Government should now be seeking this interview with you,  Sir,  ana your colleagues to protect it from the possibility of a similar Bill by the present Government the members of which when in opposition were prepared to protect industry against. We fully realise that the conclusions of the Conference do not commit this country or any other country to ratify the Washington Convention,  but the conclusions must presumably cause each of the five participating countries to reconsider the Washington Convention in the light of the conclusions. The Minister stated that he would submit those conclusions to the British  Government and when we take that fact in conjunction with your own speech in February last the possibilities of these implications are a source of real alarm.      In that speech- 6 -
you said this is an extreaely aifilcu.lt task.      i uo not know whether we shall be successful;    we shall do our utmost to secure complete agreement end understanding.      If that . agreement is reached then the ratification of the V/aahlngton Convent ion by the participating countries will then be possible and we shall proceed to  ratify, tut we are not going to ratify until we are all convinced that vie all mean the same thing.      Now to those of us responsible  for a large . share of the practical  conduct of British industry and in this I speak for the Confederation as a whole covering sheltered, unsheltered,  domestic as well as export trades, the question of safeguarding these interests and by that I mean the interests of the men  just as much as of the employers, these interests must transcend all other considerations and it is only with the deepest sense of responsibility that I wish to say on behalf of the Confederation that if the Government should decide to accept the conclusions of the London Conference as definite and sufficient and proceed to  legislation and ratification of the Washington Hours Convention then we would consider it our duty nationally to oppose that policy by every means in our power.      Now, Prime Minister, when I say that please believe me there is no spirit of reaction in that conclusion and peace and goodwill bulks very largely in all our minds in regard to all cur industrial conditions today.      You are responsible in a measure  for that,  but peace and goodwillcannot be secured by defective industrial conditions snoh as would be the case if we agree to a course of action *hxcn would lead our industries and our men further down the hillthan they are today.      We do not believe that  our industriescan be restored by statute, rather by spirit, and that is what- 7 -
we would like to work for first,  an improvement in the spirit.Not; in conclusion, I come to  one implication which I have left to the last.      if State control is to be imposed irrespective of the welfare of industry and merely as an international gesture realising the socialistic ideal we can understand it,  but not on any other basis and if from whatever cause the decision be to subject hours of work to State control it must introduce a new factor into the traditional principle of collective bargaining in industrial matters.      The Washington Convention introduced the State as the controlling agent in this vital matter of hours and it makes it possible for the Trades Unions in this country and their political leaders to use it as a weapon for hampering production and to advance their policy of discouraging private enterprise.      This is a new source of discord and it must have far reaching consequences and its result may well he the complete substitution of State control for collective agreements in industry and industrial experience particularly in the last few years we feel all goes to shew that when the State Is the third party with the final say-negotiation between the other two parties who are really immediately responsible becomes unreal and very largely ineffective.      Now when I say that I remember when the House of Commons rejected the Washington Convention in 1921 that the then Leader of the House,  Sir Austin Chamberlain, referred very definitely to that aspect of the matter.     Whet he said was this.      &quot;When employers and employed have come together in these difficult times let us thank heaven lor the reason that is shown on both sides and let us be grateful- 8 -
to them for having saved, t; e country- much dislocation suffering and misery.      Let us be grateful now that that result has been obtained lost we disturb it and throw the whole thing into the melting pot.Now I have taken a long time Prime Minister to cover that ground and I think it would be perhaps, with your permission,  best that Sir Ralph Wedgewood might elaborate very slightly what J have said,SIR RALPH WEDG.EW00D:      Sir,  I have very little to add to what Lord Weir has said,      I appear here as representative of the railway industry and the railway industry  is of course interested in this [matter not only directly as an industry, but also Indirectly and perhaps even more vitally as dependent upon the prosperity of other industries of the country, not only the export industry but also the home industries.      If I might first touch on the matter as it affects the railways qua railways,  I would say this:  that hitherto in discussions of the Washington Convention it has always been understood that the railways would be exempt.      fie now see as a result of the International Conference -which, took place in London that they are point blank included, reference being merely made to some clauses which it is thought will mitigate the position,      I am bound, to say there that the opinion of the railway companies is unaltered and in our opinion it is impossible to app.l.y the Washington Convention to the railway companies no matter how the question may be qualified by various clauses and provisoes that stand in the Washington Convention.      That, however, I merely mention in order to passion to the great general question.      We understood along with other industries that the purpose of the recent  International Conference in London was not
to remove a reproach under which the Government or the employers of this country laboured/in respect of the labour convention,      We are definitely assured that there was no obligation, there was no reproach and that that aspect of the matter was not what concerned the Ministry of Labour or the Government in calling the Conference,     We were assured that the object of calling the Conference was to assist British industry to secure on understood and&apos; definitely enforceable lines the application of the eight hours day in other countries as it was already enforced, although, not by statute ,. In the industries as a whole in this country.      It seems, if one may say so, a doubtful way of undertaking to assist British Industry to embark on a Conference of that kind without the fullest understanding and agreement before hand with the industries concerned, and I think one may say that the result of the Conference has so far., from appearing to us to help British industry in any way, appears to us on the contrary, quite definitely if it is ratified to impose further and very serious handicaps on. British industry in comparison with foreign countries.      I need not dwell on the fact that what appears in a. statute in this country is generally speaking     rried out;    that, the State has the fullest possible means of obtaining statistics from the different industries of what they do and through their inspectors they have means of seeing that the regulations that the law imposes are duly carried out      We were assured that before the Conference concluded or came to any conclusion there would be assurances that in foreign countries the necessary statistics and the necessary means of enforcement would be provided and that that was one of the purposes which the Conference had in view.      We see in fact that there is no-10-?
provision of that sort and from our experience in the past it seems to us perfectly clear that there is no means of securing a greater adherence to statutory or other regulations in regard to the hours of labour in the future than in the past.      In the same way there is a reference I think under the conclusions of the Conference to scheduling all agreements to Acts of Parliament, agreements contemplated between the Trades Unions and -the employers. Granting the desirability/ which of course we do not grant, of regulating labour In that way by agreements scheduled to Acts,  the only consequence can be this;    that in the country where trades unions are strongest the agreements will be least favourable to the employers;    in countries where trades unions are weak or do not exist the agreements will be more favourable and it would appear in that respect that the conclusions of the Conference contemplate that so long as the agreement is one accepted on both sides between employers and men it can be scheduled to an Act of Parliament and is a compliance of the Act without regard - perhaps I had better say, without excessive regard to what is actually contained in the agreement. There too.. It appears to us the position of the industries in the country if the Government should follow up the policy indicated in the conclusions of the Washington Convention, can only be very seriously to the disadvantage of industries in this country.     Apart from that I would like to urge that it is not a satisfactory or a desirable line to follow in attempting to help the industries of this country to do it by seeking more or less, may I say surreptitiously to Impose handicaps on the Industries of other countries.      If that be the object in view I venture to think it is not a sound line for the Government to take in their desire to assist the industries of the
country and it is one which is almost sure to recoil upon our heads if we attempt it.I would only urge in conclusion that we are all very much concerned, as no doubt you are,  Sir, In securing the restoration of the industries in this country to prosperity.-.      We are convinced that can only be done by two things,&apos;    by an Improved spirit betwean employers and employed and by harder work.      Now I venture to submit that State interference such as is Involved In the statutory regulation of hours of labour cannot help that spirit to develop*      It can only lead in the first place to an ever increasing tendency to go back to the Government for assistance In a difficulty,  and secondly,  it throws an apple of discord between employers and employed which can only have the effect of rendering less satisfactory and less friendly and also less responsive to the requirements of the industry the relations between employers and the employedoSIR ERNEST MOIR;      Sir,  a great deal of -sense has been talked it must be admitted and it leaves rne fortunate in having little to say0      Broadly I should like to tackle this business on   International and democratic lines if I may0      The ratification of the Washington Convention means that w e are bound for ten years to a principle which we may find very difficult to upholds With the balance of trade going as it is at the moment why should we, a country which can alter Its laws from day to day,  be bound by any international agreement to do something which is certainly not evident, however good the intention may be,  will improve the conditions of our labour and of our trade.      The other point I would like to stress of this matter is this;    the balance of trade for the past three years has been seriously falling,,      Three
years ago it approximated in our favour 150 millions; 1925 it was down to something like 29 millions.      Now suppose it goes a little further.      Having worked myself as an apprentice among the workers of this country and controlled labour In a combined capacity for nearly fifty years I think I know enough of the British working man to be assured that if he finds, as is very possible as things are going, that the balance of trade should be against us and therefore his conditions of living and that of his family are worsening, he will not only be prepared to work harder but longer hotirs, and all the evidence points in the consideration of the coal difficulty at the moment that the colliers realise that longer hours are essential.      Therefore I submit,  Sir,  if you go and bind yourselves for ten years to a 48 hour week and an eight hour day that you will not be able to reverse that should agreements be entered Into or possibly entered into as between the employers and the employed so that our manufactures on which w e alone can live and get wiiat we want,  Sir, five days&apos; feeding a week, can be forced over tariff walls and into countries wMch, due to the war and other conditions, have learned to fend for themselves or put up with things they would have to export.      Our export has fallen some 24 per cento      Our population in spite of the war and everything else has gone up.      There are more mouths to feedo      The only way  we can feed them is by export.      The only way we can get the exports is by cheaper productions      It was said when hours were shortened by legislation that we should get a greater efficiency that would make up inversely as the hours were reduced from ten to eights      That has not materialised in indastry.      We do not propose this after-noon to go into details of how this legislation would
affect different industries, but there are many outstanding reasons why the combination of forty-eight hours and eigjkt hours would be fatal and would resolve itself Into not a forty-eight hours week but something considerably less. The other possibility of it being an indictable offence to work on in meal hours otherwise fixed without permission would make It impossible to do a great many things that have to be done, but the whole matter of legislation in hours is a very difficult proposition and In a northern climate such as ours I am particularly interested In the open air.     Fortunately agriculture is not even threatened by this arrangement, but there are several industries quite akin to agriculture, civil engineering In which I am particularly interested being one.     With our short winter light and our long summer evenings, with such an arrangement as the Washington Convention foreshadowed we cannot make up in the summer for what we have lost In the winter.     Then there Is our extreme wetness which again cuts down our out-of-door labour and the consequence would be we should not get a.48-hour week at all, we should be reduced to something very much less.      I do not think there is much else I have to say but just this.      It is rather remarkable that America, the origin of this Convention, will have nothing whatever to do with it, and that I think it very important.     Vfe hear every day of the astuteness of the Americans;    in this instance I would endorse every word that is said about lto . I trust,  Sir,  I have not bored you with what I have had to say, but I feel this combination of a 48-hours week and an eight hour day and any statutory limitations that prevent us arranging as we have done in the past with our Unions the conditions and hours of labour and remunera-tion for labour without hindrance would be a very grave and disastrous thing for our industry.
LORD WKIH:May  Icall.on oir Alfred Mend?SIR ALVS&amp; D mond:Prime Minister,  the casehas been so fully covered that I have vary little  to add to it,  but I vvould say this.      We were both members of the Government in 19 1 which fully considered the question of the Washington Convention and we then decided not to ratify * The  speeches which have been referred to which were then made on behalf of the Government by Sir Austen Chamberlain seem to me as conclusive today as they were at that time,,The reasons seem clear and obvious..      To try and legislate on the question of hours is a difficult matter.      I think the legislation in the Coal Mining Industry is already causing a complication, a complication which is obvious, but even if both parties to the industry wish to alter an arrangement come  to you have  the. additional complication of Parliamentary proceedings before they can aohieve their object and when you add to the complications of legislation, with all the exceptions and exemptions which are bound to be made if it is to work at all,   the complication of international pledges, international pledges which lay ycu open either to continual attacks on the. ground that you are not carrying out your work or to the remarkable procedure in Clause 19 of the Washington Convention under which apparently a Minister of Labour in Geneva can appoint a Commission of three gentlemen who can come to this country and lay down what we have  to do to carry out the  Convention, force  the Government of this country who have no remedy except to go to the Permanent Tribunal of International Justice at The Hague,     Under that Clause they&apos; can actually compel the Government and people of this country to manage their labour on lines to which the whole nation may be opposed.      I must confess i
look with more than apprehension at any procedure of that kind even as a remote possibility.Sir Ernest Moir has raised one point which I would like  to stress.      After all, we are all of us a We. re that the real serious industrial competitor of Great Britain is going to be the United States of America.    The United St;.: tes of America is no party to this Convention. It is not bound&apos;by it and will not be bound by it in any way.      Is it really conceivably reasonable that we should bind ourselves to other Powers who may or may not carry out the  terms of the Convention and leave outside the most serious and most virile and most active of our competitors?     Another reason which I think weighed a good deal with us in lyEl was this.      There were certain doubts as to how far this Convention would really be put into practice by other countries.      With international agreements we have more than once been in the position that we carry out our bargains and the other people do not. If I may say so the settlement of the American Debt which you carried out at the  time on behalf of the Government was one of the many instances.      Other Governments may pass Acts.      They may even issue Administrative Decrees, but I doubt whether they will ever be quite so particular in the execution of those Decrees,  if they are unpopular with their people, as our Government would feel itself compelled to be.      In that connection I notice a rather interesting point which has arisen since the London Conference.    The Minister of Labour in the House of Commons on the 1st May last in exposing the practices operating in France under the Might Hour Day Act said that the
practice of accumulating lost time and so distributing it as to permit of a nine or ten hours normal day would be perfectly impossible under tho British interpretation of a similar Act.      The French Minister of labour&apos; on his return to France after the London Conference in an interview is reported to have said that the conclusions of that Conference involved no alteration in the French law,  so even before we start doing anything at all ourselves you have this kind of difference of view and opinion expressed by people who have only just left a mutual Conference.      How why should we do this?     The only conceivable reason I can imagine is the idea that if by means of a Convention we can get the hours of labour,  overtime and similar regulations, established in Continental oountries it will help us who have to work on that line in this country whether we like it or not, in competition with them      I would gladly give up any advantage of that kind in a bargain of this sort.      I think it is too dangerous and personally speaking, for an industry in which we were the pioneers of the eight hours dayf we have no fear of the eight hours day as such.      I would say this,  I think the Government would be well advised to maintain the attitude of previous Governments, namely,  to refuse to tie the hands of the British people in a thing which is,  after all, a purely domestic matter.        (Hear Hear)PRIMS MINISTER; I think perhaps now itwould be convenient if Sir Arthur Steel --Maitland would tell us what he did at the London Conference and what his aim was at that Conference.    perhaps, Sir Arthur, you would do that?
HlulIoQliJK Cls1 iu*J30l)iv:      Lord vveir and Gentlemen, I have listened with very great attention to all that has been said.      This is an explanation, an account,  of what has happened.      I agree entirely with what Lord Weir has quoted from my  speech in the House of Commons last year with reference  to the Washington Convention.      With that I still absolutely and wholly agree, every word of it. I consider that the Washington Convention, as taken by itself,  is quite inapplicable to this country and for two quite definite reasons which I then gave; because, first of all, of the reason of interpretation and enforcemento      Insofar as there might be differences of interpretation perfectly easily possible under what seemed to me  the loose language of the Convention I came to the conclusion, and I believe others too,  that it would not really be wise for this country  to assent to any Convention which could be -(Division called - short interval)When the Division was called I was saying I still adhered to the views I expressed on the Washington Convention.    I said I thought it was inapplicable for two reasons,  first of all,  the looseness of its phraseology might enable other countries, through having more elastic standards of interpretation and more lax ideas of enforcement to place on their nationals lighter obligations than we, with stricter ideas under the Convention, would place upon our nationals,,    I think that is clear and I still adhere to it absolutely.    Best I thought it was inapplicable to us for another reason, that we work certain practices in our industry in this country,  some of which, probably most of which, were inIS.
7 O 9harmony with the spirit of the Convention and yet at the same time would be ruled out by  the wording of the Convention itself.      There was,  first of all,   the difficulty as regards tho Hallway agreement in this country and secondly there was the  type of difficulty that a number of our industries which work forty-eight hours or less do so in a week of five days which, under the Convention taken by itself and strictly construed a s w e should construe it,  if it was not modified,  would not be permissible.    That was the situation.      At the same time I think no-one has ever forgotten that in Part XIII of the Peace Treaty it is definitely laid upon the countries who are parties to the ieace Treaty that they should explore the possibility of the regulation of hours of work, including the establishment of a maximum working day or week a      That obligation still exists and tt the same time other constituent bodies representing employers In this country have expressed their own opinion of the desirability of trying to arrive at some international agreement as regards hoursu      I believe the Shipbuilders had a sentence in their Joint report to that effect,  but the most important was that cf the xsingineering Federation which brought a deputation to me to ask whether action could be taken and to press upon me the fact that action should be taken in this respect,      Now it was under those circumstf. noes that I asked the other Labour Ministers of the other four principal European countries to meet me to discuss the situation.    From the point of view of assistance to British industry and to interests in this country we wished to see whether the Washington Convention, or some other Convention of the kind could be made which^
should not have the drawbacks which seemed, to mo to he inherent in the Washington Convention taken by itself, as I said, in the House of Commons.    Might I then further ask the deputation to bear in mind, this is what actually happened at tho Conference.      we considered what I call the loopholes due to the loose language of the Convention, by the interpretation of which and by looser enforcement of which other countries, as I say, could place upon their nationals lighter obligations than we, interpreting it strictlys would place upon ours,    Mow those loopholes are several in number and in a moment or two, as I think there has been some misconception with regard to it,  from the speeches I have heard,  I will deal with one or two of the points that arise from them.      The biggest loophole was the question of how tc define hours of work.      It might mean that in some other country under a loose interpretation of hours of work, a man who worked in a signal box,  or any other occupation where he was not,  strictly speaking, at it the whole time, he might be there for twelve hours,  but under that type of loose interpretation,  as the  Convention stood, he might be only rated as a seven or eight hour day.      Obviously in a case of that kind we,  interpreting the existing Convention strictly, might be put at a disadvantage as compared with people who adopted a loose interpretation and loose enforcement.    Well, we got that loophole shut up.    They agreed quite definitely to the interpretation which we wished to place upon it,,     A similar type of leak consisted in the possible definition of intermittent work.      It would be possible for some countries to claim that certain kinds of work were intermittent which we should not dream of classing as.0.
intermittent in this country.      Everybody would admit that a person who was a lock-keeper or something of that kind was really doing intermittent work.      On the other hand if it were extended,  as 0110 had reason to believe it would be extended,  as the Washington Ccnvention stood,   it might cover a lot of occupations which in this country we should not dream of classing as intermittent.     Again we got an agreement upon that, defining it so closely and strictly that that danger was removed,,      Another possible difficulty arose as regards continuous processes,,      In anticipation of some criticisms which Lord Weir passed I ought to add that the agreement as published does not deal with continuous processes and,  as Lord weir said,   I considered it essential that a schedule of processes properly considered as continuous should be drawn up.     As a matter of fact that was agreed to quite definitely,  but at the express request of the German Minister of Labour it was kept private for the moment because he himself was due to introduce measures in  the German Parliament and he did not wish to appear to commit himself to a particular schedule, for political reasons,  before his Bill had been introduced.      It was quite clearly understood that we should exchange lists of continuous processes and  that we should, arrive at an agreement on the schedule of the processes which ought properly to be considered continuouso Mow as regards the next point, what I call possibly the biggest leak of them all,  that was the making up of lost time *     illusion has been made  to this in the speeches that have  already been made.      I did draw attention inlo
Parliament to the danger that existed, for example in Prance, of the practice of counting hours that were lost through holidays and hours lost through slackness of trade as lost time that might be made up by spreading it over the rest of the working days and working months without such hours as were spread over being counted as overtime and paid at the overtime rate0     Again after a considerable argument we have got that quite definitely excluded,  so that leak Is also corked.      Now those are what I call the leakages which., on account, as I say, of elastic interpretation and loose enforcement made me unwilling to assent on the part of this country to the Washington Convention in its original form, but on those points we reached careful and close agreements at the London Conference.      Then there was a difficulty in the original Convention of another kind,  that It did not allow,  for example, for the practice of the English five-dajr week,  that it would have excluded the English agreement as regards railways *      Again we reached an agreement there which specifically made both those practices possible,  so  that from all those points of view I would lay before the deputation the consideration that the drawbacks which I saw last year in the Washington Convention,  taken by itself, were removed and if the Washington Convention is read together with what one might call the London Annexe, but not without it,  then It constitutes for us In this country and. for those engaged in industry in this country an entirely different instrument from the Washington    Convention taken by itself, i wish to lay stress upon that because the whole of what we discussed there was based on the idea that any
agreement that this country entered into afterwards would not be the Washington Convention by Itself, but the Washington Convention so enlarged and amended that it would ensure precisely the uniformity of practice to which Lord Weir has alluded and I think if you gentlemen will read it in that spirit carefully,  the Convention plus the Annexe.,  I think you will see that without question It does provide In the first place for that uniforraity- of practice and also it gives place for those English working agreements as regards the five-day week and the railways which have been a stumbling block in the Convention as originally drafted..      That I would commend to your consideration,  but may I just go on to deal math one or  two of the points.      i have dealt with some of the points which have been raised.      i would only go on to deal in this connection with one other point which Lord Weir has raised.      He quoted me as saying that an international maximum of overtime was necessary0      The only reason I did not press that was because of  the condition of Industry itself in this country.      When I considered and had a conference with regard to the engineering industry, for example,  they did not wish to have any legal maximum placed upon the engineering industry and I do not think, from the point of view of the British Engineering Industry itself, and some of the other industries of this country,  the Ship Repairing industry and others,  it would be a wise thing to try and impose a legal maximum.      There was another way of arriving at that uniformity of practice and that was to insist - it had hitherto not been entirely the practice of other countries;      I fancy even of those that had previously
thought of signing the Washington Convention - was to Insist rigorously on the minimum rate of overtime being time and a quarter.      That Is the prevailing minimum in this country.      On the other hand In foreign countries the minimum rate of overtime is In a great many cases less than time and a quarter so that from our point of view, from the point of view of competition , to get an agreement on the minimum rate of time and a quarter was to our advantage.      That again was agreed to.      I would therefore once again suggest that if you t alee the Convention plus the Annexe you get an instrument which really arrives at what in my previous letters and my previous speeches I did say would be suitable to this country.      In fact if,   as Sir Ralph Wedgewood has remarked, if I took his words down aright, what we wanted was to secure on understood and enforceable lines the eight hours in other countries,  just as it was already enforced, not by statute, but by agreement in this country.      That is really what we are likely to  reach under the Convention, taken together with  the Annexe, but not otherwise and I would say that for my own part I would never advise the Government here to ratify the Convention by Itself, but only to ratify the Convention plus the Annexe and only to ratify the Convention plus the Annexe on the understanding that the other great countries with which&apos;we were dealing should ratify also the Convention plus the annexe,  so that we get a real uniformity of practice and of obligation;    that also we should be satisfied that the laws they proposed would also carry out their obligations under the Convention plus the
Annaxe that they were prepared to ratify.      Under- those circumstances I do myself think that that course Is likely quite definitely  to &quot;be an advantage and not a hindrance to British Industry.      The sentiment was uttered this afternoon that it was not a good thing to try and help British industry by some backdoor method of increasing the costs in other countries.      If I was back again in industry I must say I should be rather glad to see the costs of some of my competitors Increased and also If I looked to the fact that it would be exceedingly difficult to increase ours in this country.      Sir Ernest Moir has,  I think,  said that In his opinion it would be desirable to try and get the existing week of forty-eight hours or less increased again in this country.SIR E. MOIR:      I did not say so.MINISTER OF LABOUR:      I only gathered that from his remarks.     He did not mean that?SIR E. MOIR:      I never said it,  sir.MINISTER OF LABOUR:      You did not say it?SIR E. MOIR:      No.MINISTER OF LABOUR:      Perhaps I am dotting the t&apos;s and crossing the i&apos;&apos;s;    but I do feel that that is a point which would be resisted most strenuously and from the point of view of British Industry itself I would ask the members of the deputation to consider most seriouslymomentwhether, if their desire,- though unexpressed at the is to try and increase the ordinary working week in this country,  whether they are really not forsaking the substance for the shadow in this respects      As regards the particular point Sir Ernest Moir mentioned about industries that have to work less than the forty-eight
hour week in Winter and who would wish it made up in Summer, that is provided for as a matter of fact under Article 5 of the Convention.      In regard to an Increase of the general forty-eight hour week,  I do aek members to ask themselves whether they think it Is an expectation they can ever reasonably expect to see carried through In this country?     Personally I do not think it is.      I have made all the enquiries I have been able.      I think the Trade Union movement would look upon the forty-eightthehour week as the Ark of/Covencnt and that their resistance to any attempt to extend beyond the forty-eight hours would be stronger probably than their resistance to any other proposal that was placed before them.      If that is so,  I do  ask members of the deputation to consider, ien&apos;t it wiser to try to get the same higher standards accepted by our principal competitors than to leave them still perfectly free and at the same time continue In our own Trade Union agreements which are not likely to be modified in this respect?      I am sorry I have taken up so much of your time.      I would just ask you to consider one more important thing,     Under the late Labour Government the Bill for enforcement of the Washington Convention was not carried through, but It Is clear that there Is every intention to get it through0 A limitation of hours for men as well as for women or boys is not in itself  !0mnes.................. 1o

It ie not like State management of industry.      There is a difference between the two, because I am as opposed to State management of industry as anybody could be, but I do foreses the danger,,, if we do not proceed with the policy of getting our great rivals on the Continent to agree with us in ratifying the Convention plus the London Annexe, taken Jointly.      If we do that I genuinely think you will find that the standards in foreign countries will gradually be raised while I doubt if any of the great British industries in this country will feel that any difference at all had been made to them because the obligations, most of them, are obligations under which they are working at the present moment and therefore, as I say, the path of safety seems to be quite distinctly on the lines of the Convention plus the Annexe,      If on the other hand that is put into the scrap heap I would ask you to consider what would be the position if you had what I may briefly call the Shaw Bill really carried into law as it stood without any of the safeguards which are found in the Annexe which will make other countries come up to our own standards of Interpretation and without any of the adjustments which fit it to British Industry In such matters as either the Railway Agreement or the five-day week.      I have tried to put the matter perfectly clearly.      I hope if there is any point I have left obscure you will please let me know what the point is.
LORD $SIR:    Perhaps It would be more convenient to deal now with the single question of the initiation referred to by Sir Arthur from certain industries, in particular Shipbuilding and Engineering, because we consider it essential that their position should be made absolutely clear.      I will ask Sir Andrew Duncan to speak?SIR ANDREW DUNCAN:    I am sorry to take up your time, but I think the Minister of Labour did have a tip and run at shipbuilding as being one of the reasons for this conference in London being called.      I describe it as a tip and run because I do not suppose the Minister of Labour would even say for a single moment that shipbuilding had the slightest thing to do with the convening of the Conference and if anything that the shipbuilders have said in their negotiations with the workmen throughout the past year has led to the belief that we are ready in the shipbuilding industry for legislation on this subject,  I would like to sa-r,  on behalf of Shipbuilding,  that as an industry we  take the gravest exception to this particular Convention with this particular Annex,  so that our opposition is as determined and  firm as that of any other trade present. There is just this further thing I would like to say, that anything we have said about hours in our negotiations with the   workmen - we have said something;    it is on record and can be appealed to - anything we have said we have said in conjunction with six other things that we said in an Interim Report&quot;.      Not one of them had to be taken as final;    not one of them had to be read separately
from the others;    all had to be read together;    there were quid pro question in abundance;    all had to be read together and if we ran enough risks in our negotiations with Labour - and you must get something down on paper sometimes even with tentative proposals - we ran enough risks with Labour in having our tentative proposals quoted against us as definite proposals,   but when we run the risk of a responsible Minister of the Crown indicating that he separates one from the other,  it makes us hesitate 1 am afraid for the future about getting down to agreements. I hope I have made it quite clear that so far as shipbuilding is concerned we stand, where the other industries stand.      We are not  looking at this thing unsympathetically at all.      We look at It quite sympathetically,  but not as it would apply to British Industries and to our Industry in particular.LORD WEIR:    Perhaps General Bayley might speak in regard to Engineering.GENERAL BAYLEY:    Sir Arthur said they approached the Foreign Ministers as a result of an application by the engineers. .MINISTER OF LABOUR:    No,  I did not say that.GENERAL BAYLEY:    I made a note of it.      I may have misunderstood it,  that it was due to a movement made by the Engineers that you approached them.MINISTER OF LABOUR:    I said - in the meantime a movement had taken place.GENERAL BAYLEY:    You asked the Foreign Ministers before you were approached by the Engineers?MINISTER OF LABOUR:      Certainly.GENERAL BAYLEY:    I only wanted that point clear. As to the reason for the Engineers approaching you, I think it is only right you should have it made clear that
owing to an application for increased, wages by the engineers throughout the country and there not being the money in the industry, we put it to them that  the only way in which they could get the extra money was by working extra hours and,  as a matter of fact, we believe in spite of what the leaders of labour will  say, that had that matter been put to the vote of the men in the shops it is more than probable that the vote of the men in the shops would have been in favour of it.      But this is by the way.      It is  true,  as Sir Ernest Moir was saying that when It came to a pinch it is very possible the men might agree to increasing their hours of labour, but the Unions - we put it to them too and we agreed  with the Unions that we would approach the Government and see whether some arrangement by which the hours in foreign countries would be reduced could be found, which would remove the claim we were making on our Unions for increased hours.      At this conference there was no question of anything on the lines of the Washington Convention,      I think you have It in writing. That was the last thing in our minds.      To say that we, as Engineers, are in any  way agreeable to the Washington Convention is not so and there are many points besides those in the Annex of which you speak which do not get over many of the difficulties of ordinarv manufacture which are covered by the words of the Washington Convention and which would make the carrying on of the industry very difficult.LORD WEIR.:      Prime Minister,  I have listened to what Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland has termed an explanation of how the Conference came about and his
individual view as to the results of that conference and without going into details I have  to  tell you that we consider his explanation entirely unconvincing and entirely unsatisfactory from the point of view of industry. He  says - hr ve we read and studied the papers?      It is far too serious a thing,sir.      The people who have read and studied it are ourselves who have to administer it finally because it affects us more than anyone else and that is why we have come  to you tcday,  because we have read and studied it.      perhaps it might have made things a great deal easier if the Government had said to us  1w&amp;uld it be a real asset to British Industry if effective uniformity of working hours were secured internationally?&apos;*      That is a reasonable question and I think we would have said to you &apos;ies,  try and do it&apos;, but the Washington Convention plus the London Conference does not secure that.      All he has done is to patch a few leaks and has left hundreds unpatched.      Tho more we investigate it among ourselves and learn the meticulous details of the different industries the more and more leaks we find that would require to be patched. How I have listened with particular interest to the way in which Sir Arthur dealt with this question.     He gave us first not what we expected, not whet we ask - we ask &apos;What good is this going to do?&apos;.      Thfct is the only question worth asking today about industry - what good is it going to do?     As ft. r as I understood him the sole good is some doubtful difference in the overtime rate that might be achieved in Germany.      We do not regard it as worth while,   that amount of good.      Our industry at the present moment does not think it is worth the risks, the dangers and the gamble which Sir Alfred iviond has referred to.      So that there arises between a Minister of
the Crown and. the representatives of every industry in this country an acute difference of opinion on a very important matter.      That is the position.      Sir Arthur referred to something air iirnest hoir said and I want to put this because  I know it is really what air iirnest wished to convey and. I hope he will allow me to do it.      At the back of his mind he feels that the country which pays high wages and which carries out the great performance which this country is carrying out,  which gives such extensive social  services may possibly in the course of the world&apos;s economics only be able to maintain those conditions by somewhat longer hours.      There is no plot to lengthen hours.      That is not at  the bacx of our minds, but if this country sets that standard above all other countries it may have to work,  it will have to work to maintain that standard. America  cannot maintain its standard today without working longer hours than we do.      What I hope is that under your Government we are going to pull industry round.      We do not think this is going to help pull it round.      We  think it is going to do harm and that is why we have come to you today and been quite frank and told you exactly what we think and if we have to go back feeling that there is any  chance of the patched-up Washington Convention being ratified I can only tell you we will do everything in our power to prevent it. (He ar He ar),
PRIiviB MI1USTER:I do not think there is muchmore to be said this evening.      I am much obliged to you for bringing the deputation and for making your views so olear and explicit.      This whole matter will have in due course to come up before the Cabinet where it has not been yet and I think the best thing I can do,  to see that your views are placed clearly before them,  is to circulate a copy of today3s proceedings,      I think that would be the most satisfactory way and they can digest it before they consider the matter.      That I will have done.      I do not think there is anything more I can say at this moment.      What about a report in the tress?     Had you better agree about that?of the Confederation I can say we accept as satisfactory the procedure which you have suggested, that is that what has happened today will be circulated to  the Cabinet.      If the Cabinet go against our views then it is the Cabinet that has gone against us,I cannot say anything more at the moment than that I will circulate the proceedings,,      There will have to be a formal notice in the tress.     Lord Weir, would you be good enough to agree with Sir Horace Wilson on the baldest statement you think will do for the tress,  otherwise they may make tip all kinds of things.      you can hardly all of you slip into the House unnoticed;    you are fairly wellknown.LORD WEIR:I think,, Prime Minister,  on behalfPRIhiS Mill ISTcIR:I have made my position clear(The deputation then withdrew).,Whitehall Gardens,  S.wol.
