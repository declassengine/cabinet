-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAIN NIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERN MBNT) .IMPERIAL WAR GRAVES ENDOWMENT FUND BILL. Memorandum by the Secretaryof state for Dominion Affairs.I have received urgent representations from several of the Dominion Governments with regard to the Imperial War Graves Endowment Fund Bill now before Parliament.     While in no way questioning the right of the United Kingdom Government to do what it likes with regard to the United Kingdom contribution to this Fund, they point out that this Bill is a departure from the precedent, established In connection with the War Graves,  of proceeding by agreement obtained at Imperial Conferences and giving effect to such agreement through Royal Charter rather than by Acts of Parliament passed by all the Legislatures concerned.   The original Charter thus granted on the advice of the Imperial War Conference In 1917 has been amended twice subsequently, in 1921 and 1923, on the advice of the Imperial Conference.The Dominion Governments draw attention in particular to the clauses of the Imperial War Graves Endowment Fund Bill dealing with the investment of capital and Income,  the accumulation of Income, and the audit of accounts in respect of the grants of the United Kingdom,     The Imperial War Graves Commission have always held that under Part VI. I. (ii) of their original Charter (see words underlined in this clause of Part VI,  a copy of which is attached)  it Is possible for any of the contributing Governments to attach such conditions as they may wish to their grants and their Legal AdvisersC R EjR -CABINET,132 (26).
3n *&quot;*maintain that it is inconceivable that a body such as the Commission should not observe these conditions.      I under-stand however,  that the Treasury fear that they could, not make these conditions a legally enforceable bargain with the Commission without an Act of Parliament.The Dominion Governments point out that if it is necessary to make these conditions so enforceable, they must pass corresponding Acts in their Parliaments and confusion is bound to arise.      They do not think it is so necessary, but to meet the United Kingdom Government they would,  I understand-,  agree to obtain the approval of the Imperial Conference to a Supplemental Charter making the accumulation of income in augmentation of the Endowment Fund,  dealt with in Clause 2,(2)   (b) of the Bill In respect of the United Kingdom contribution, compulsory in respect of all contributions :    On the other hand the Treaswry view is that this matter should be dealt with by Statute.With regard to the other two conditions, i.e. those dealt with in Clause 2(2)   (a)  and (c),  I understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is prepared to enter into an understanding with the Trustees as to the first;    but feels that  (c),  like  (b),  should be dealt with by Statute.As regards  (c)  (which deals with audit) whilst under Part VIII Clause 1 of the Charter the joint accounts of the Commission are audited by an Auditor named by the Governor of the Bank of England,  the United Kingdom grants are, under an arrangement made with Sir Austen Chamberlain when Chancellor of the Exchequer,  further open to the inspection of the Comptroller and Auditor-General,  in the same way as the accounts of the other grants are in theory open to
Inspection by the Dominion audit tors-Gene r-a 1 -     This,  I am led to understand, has enabled the Treasury to direct the form of accounts,  and the Comptroller and Auditor-General to report to the House of Commons where these accounts have been annually examined by the Public Accounts Committee.      The Dominions have never raised any objection to this additional check, nor have  they felt it necessary to insist on the extremely cumbrous procedure of submitting the accounts of their contributions to their own Auditors-General - but this, as indicated above,  local opinion would moat probably require them to do were the arrangement as regards audit of the United Kingdom grants by the Comptroller and Auditor-General once made statutory.The Commission are, I understand, prepared to make precisely the same arrangement with regard to the accounts of the Trustees of the Endowment Fund in so far as they relate to United Kingdom grants.I further understand that the War Graves Commission desire the omission of Clause 1 of the Bill for the following reason.      By the terms of the Charter there must be three Trustees of the Endowment Fund and assurances have been given (including one In the House of Commons In the course of the Debate on the second reading of the Bill) that one of these three should represent Dominion interests. If the Trustees are incorporated the incorporators can in the absence of provision to the contrary act by a majority, with the result that the Dominion Trustee eo\ild. be overruled by the two others;    this would not be the case if they remained three unincorporated Trustees.      I am also informed by the Commission that,  owing to the nature of their trust,  any practicable advantages from incorporation are negligible.
Dominions Office. 25th March,  1926.It seems to me most important that the spirit of co-operation with the Dominions  in this matter, which has had such happy results for the past eight years, si.ould.be preserved, and I would therefore ask the Cabinet to agree to the amendment of the Imperial War Graves Endowment Fund Eill by the withdrawal of all the Clauses except Clauses 2(1)   (the object of which co\ild not,  I understand by effected by amendment of the Charter in consequence of the existing law against accumulation) and Clause 3,  on the understanding that the Commission will promote a Supplemental Charter through the Imperial Conference making the accumulation of Income in augmentation! of the Endowment Fund from the grants of the United Kingdom and all the Dominions compulsory, and also making the accounts of the Trustees open to the inspection of the Comptroller and Auditor General of the United Kingdom and the Auditors-General of the Dominions in respect of their several grantsoL o S o A i
