[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1926.SECRET. Copy No.   41CP. 130 (26).CABINET.EAST AFRICAN  AND  PALESTINE LOANS.Memorandum by the Treasury. (Circulated by tlie Chancellor of the Exchequer.)THE Treasury do not regard the addition of  14^ million of guaranteed stock to their market responsibilities lightly. The effect of such an addition on the credit of the Imperial Government depends not on the ratio of the addition to the outstanding debt but on its relation to other demands which at the present moment the Treasury has to make on the money market and to the general capital programme of His Majesty&apos;s Government. These are matters with which the Colonial Office are naturally not fully acquainted. Further, the effect of a guarantee is not merely by giving the status of a trustee security to increase the area of possible lenders. The far more important result is that, by substituting the security of Great Britain for that of East Africa and Palestine, the terms on which those countries can borrow are substantially improved. Palestine, with the British mandate terminable at an uncertain future date, could not raise a long term loan in the London market at all without a guarantee, except on very onerous terms.2. The Treasury do not, however, raise objection in principle to the guarantee of these two loans; subject (a) to the necessary local ordinances being passed in a form satisfactory to the Treasury, and (b) in the case of East Africa, to agreement being reached (on the recommendations of the Colonial Office Committee of which Sir George Schuster is Chairman), as to the precise works which are to be carried out from the loan.3. The Cabinet should be aware that in the case of Palestine there is a long standing dispute between the Palestine Government and the bondholders of the Turkish debt as to the payments which Palestine should make in respect of the share of that debt assignable to her under the Lausanne Treaty. Considerable criticism may be anticipated if a guaranteed loan for Palestine is issued in the London market before a settlement has been reached with regard to the Palestine share of the Ottoman debt. The Colonial Office are understood to be negotiating with the bond-holders, but it is most desirable that these negotiations should be accelerated and brought to a conclusion before the new loan has actually to be issued.4. On the question of the channel for the issue of the guaranteed loan the Treasury dissent absolutely from the proposals of the Colonial Office.From the point of view of the market, it is quite incorrect to suppose that the guaranteed Colony is borrowing on its own revenues. The position of its revenues is important as between the Treasury and the Colony; from the point of view of the market the local revenues are entirely irrelevant. What the market looks to is the fact that the security is that of the British Government. Indeed, if this were not the effect of a British guarantee, there would be no advantage to the Colony in such a guarantee, and the Colony would not in fact seek it. A guaranteed loan is for market purposes as much a British Government loan as Consols. It is quoted in Stock Exchange lists and dealt with on the Stock Exchange as a. British Government security and not in the section which deals with Colonial stocks. The Treasury, in giving their guarantee, make the Colonial loan their own and it is for them to say how that loan should be issued and managed. [14345]
The Colonial Office quote the precedent of Mauritius 3 per cent, loan, which was issued through the Crown Agents. That was as long ago as 1892, and even then it was an exception. The loan was issued to provide relief from hurricane damage in Mauritius; a local ordinance had been hurriedly passed domiciling the loan with the Crown Agents, and, in order not to delay the relief so urgently needed, the Treasury acquiesced and did not demand an alteration in the arrangements already made. The total loan was only  600,000. This was the exception which proves the rule. Since then there has been no guaranteed loan issued in any way other than the way in which all British Government stocks are issued, i.e., through the Bank of England. Instances are the Transvaal loan of 1903 - the Austrian Guaranteed loan; the Sudan Guaranteed Loan; and all the numerous issues, many of them for overseas under -takings, under the Trade Facilities Acts. The Colonial Office suggestion would be a complete break with established practice and would certainly rouse very adverse comment in the city.The Treasury think there is no foundation for the suggestion that the general prestige of unguaranteed loans raised through the Crown Agents would be enhanced by an issue through them of a guaranteed loan.The question whether commission is paid to the Bank of England or the Crown Agents is of quite minor importance, though in fact the issue would be at least as cheap, if not cheaper, through the Bank of England ; and it must be remembered that the more there is paid out of the proceeds of the guaranteed loan in commissions, the less will be available for actual works in the Colonies affected.The Treasury regard this question as one of fundamental principle, and they cannot accept the view that stocks for which the British Government is responsible should be issued on the London market in any other way than the ordinary way to which the money market are accustomed. It is British credit and not that of the Colonies which would be affected by any unfavourable reception of the new issue, and the Treasury must maintain that in these circumstances it is for them to choose the channel of issue which they regard as the most satisfactory. They are most strongly opposed to a departure from the established method of issue for all British stocks.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,March 24, 1926.
