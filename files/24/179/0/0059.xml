Report of the Royal Commission on the Coal Industry.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Health on the housing of miners transferred to new minefields.Part I.     General Cons j. derations.1. Extent of problem.It may be assumed that in every case the transfer of labour to a new mining area will involve the building of houses for the workers.   As the vacated houses may in some cases remain vacant, the effect of the transfer may be &apos; to inorease the housing shortage,^* Housing by Local Authorities.Local Authorities (that is, Borough or Urban or Rural District Councils) have power to build houses for the working olasses with financial assistance from the Exchequer under the Housing Acts of 1323 and 1924.    The terms of suoh assistance are briefly explained in Part II of this...memorandum.   Before deoiding whether to undertake a scheme the Local Authority may, no doubt,  desire to have-authoritative information with regard to the probable life of the mines, and it 1b suggested for consideration whether such information could be supplied to them, through the Ministry of Health, by the Ministry of Mines.    Too much must not, however, be expected from building by the Local Authorities themselves.    In many cases the new minefields will be in Rural or small Urban Districts, which have not a large rateable value.    A building undertaking would involve the raising of a considerable capital sum on
mortgage of the rates, and, in most cases, an annual loss to the rates of about  4. 10. 0. per house for a period of 40 years.   It may be expected, therefore, that the smaller Local Authorities may be nervous of committing themselves to large schemes.3* Housing by private enterprise.The alternative is that building should be undertaken by the Colliery Companies themselves, or by specially constituted Societies or Companies, sponsored by the Colliery Companies,    The terms of the assistance available by way of subsidy or loan for building by private enterprise are explained in Part III of this memorandum.    It will be seen that, failing assistance from the local Authority, the necessary capital might be provided at least in part, by means of a loan from the Public Vforks Loan Commissioners, or a loan guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Acts.    Parts 17 and V contain some illustrations of housing schemes for miners, undertaken, or proposed to be undertaken by private enterprise.    It would appear that the existing machinery is sufficient to enable building to proceed.4. Procedure suggested.(a) The Colliery Company should in the first inatanc acquaint themselves with the available alternatives, and, if desired a memorandum could be supplied to them by the Ministry of Health on the lines of this memorandum.(b) The Company should then approach the Local Authority for the area and ascertain whether the Authority would be willing to build houses themselves, or, in the
alternative, to assist the Company &quot;by the grant of eubsidies and/or loans.(c)     Failing assistance from the Local Authority, the Company should then consider the formation of a special Society or Company which could obtain assistance direct from Government Departments.    They would &quot;be well advised at an early stage (i.e, &quot;before the constitution of the Society or Company) to confer with the Ministry of Health (as regards subsidies) and the Public Works Loan Commissioners or Trade Facilities Committee (as regards loans).Part II. Exchequer assistance for buil^ing^ by Local &quot; &quot;       &quot; Auff o rxxlonT &quot;       *&quot;5. Under the He using.,-, etc. Act.  10 gg.(a).     The annual Exchequer contribution is  6 per house for twenty years.(b) There is no statutory limitation on sent8,(c) The houses may be sold to the occupiers by instalments (by way of addition to the rent) or with the assistance of a loan granted by the Local Authority on mortgage.6. Under the Housing (Financial^^9J^^ ^1^A^l^2^^.&apos;(a) The annual Exchequer contribution is  R per house for 40 years, or  12. 10, 0. in an agricultural parish,(b) The maximum rents are calculated on the basis fixed by the Act.    This will usually involve a less to the rateB of  4.  10. 0. per house for 40 years.
(c)     The houses may be sold, but unless sold subject to the special conditions presoribed by the Aot, the subsidy will be reduced and curtailed.Part I IT... Assistance to^ pjrivat e ent srpri se.? * Un.de rta.kerB.A scheme for the housing of miners may be undertaken by:-(a) A colliery company.(b) A public utility society, i.e.  &quot;a Society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893 to 1913, the rules whereof prohibit the issue of any share or loan capital with interest or dividend exceeding the rate for the time being prescribed by the Treasury.M(o)     A specially constituted Housing Company, i.e.  &quot;a Company which does not trade for profit or whose constitution forbids the issue of any share or lean capital with interest or dividend exceeding the rate for the time being prescribed by the treasury.&quot;HOTS.    At the present time the rate prescribed by the Treasury for the purpose of the definitions in (b) and (c) is 6 per cent.(d)     Any other Company or Association or responsible person,8. Assistance Available  (summary), (a)     Subsidies.Any undertaker may obtain subsidies from the Local Authority under the Act of 1923 or the Act of 1924.

Subsidies from the Loo-aljjLvthcrlty.The Local Authorities may grant subsidies, either under the Aot of 1S23 or under the Act of 1924, to any of the undertakers mentioned in paragraph 7.
(a) Under the Housing., etc i Act, 1923, the Local Authority may make a capital grant per house representing the present value (approximately  75) of the Exchequer subsidy of  6 for 20 years paid to the Local Authority.     The Local Authority may also,  if they think fit, make an additional capital grant par house from the rates.     The houses must comply with the statutory and other prescribed conditions as to superficial area, provision of bathroom, density- per acre&quot;,  . construction etc.    There is no restriction on rents andthe houses may be sold to the occupiers,(b) Under the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924, the Local Authority may pass on to the private builder the annual Exchequer subsidy of  9 per house for 40 years, and may,  if they think fit, make am additional annual grant from,the rates.     This subsidy cannot be capitalised.     The maximum rent is determined by the Local Authority on the basis fixed by the Act, and will visually involve an annual loss (after allowing for the  9 subsidy) of  4*10,0. per house, which unless an additional subsidy is given from the rates, would have to be. met by the Colliery Company.   The building contract must contain a fair wages clause and the houses must comply with the conditions mentioned in paragraph (a) immediately above. See paragraph 6 (c) as to conditions affecting sale&apos;.(o)       The choice between the alternative subsidies . depends upon the rent which the miners are accustomed, or willing, to pay.
(d) The conditions of subsidy are fully explained in the Ministry of Health Circular No.520.(e) The amount of the subsidies is due for reconsideration in October, 1926.10*     Subsidies from the Ministry of Health,The Ministry of Health can pay subsidies direct to a Public Utility Soc-iety or Specially Constituted Housing Company,,     Tho subsidy under the Act.of 1923 is  6 per house for 20 years, and, under the Act of 1924,  9 per house for 40 years.     The conditions under which subsidy may be granted are,  in each case, as explained in paragraph 9, with the exceptions that:-(i)no additional subsidy can be made from the ratesj and (ii)nei,ther subsidy can be capitalised, 11.     Loans from the Local Authority.(a) The Local Authority has power to advance loans for building to any of the undertakers mentioned in paragraph 7.    The maximum advance is 90% of the &quot;Value&quot; (not cost) of the land and houses, as estimated by the Local Authority.     They have also a power (not often exercised) to make advances of the loan during construction up to 80% of the value of the work done including the site value.   The rats of interest would probably be about 8k% and the period of the loan would be 20 to 40 years.(b) Loans on the same terms may be advanced by County Councils, but little use has been made of this power by County Councils up to the present time.
(c) Local Authorities and County Councils have special powers to subscribe for share capital xc loan stock Issued by a Public Utility Society.(d) Advances to intending occupiers for the buildiig or purchase of houses may be made by Local Authorities or County Councils.     The terms of the loan are as described in paragraph (a).   There is also power to guarantee advances by Building Societies.12*     Land.A private undertaker sometimes finds difficulty in acquiring land at a reasonable price.     A Local Authority has power to acquire land compulsorily (the prioe being fixed by arbitration) and sell or lease it for development by private enterprise,     A County Council has similar powers in the case of Public Utility Societies13..     Loans from the^ Public Works Loan Commissioners.Loans may bo advanced by the Public Works Loan Commissioners to any of the undertakers mentioned in paragraph 7, but the maximum advance to a Colliery Company would be one-half of the value of the land and houses.      A specially constituted Housing Company may obtain a loan up to three-quarters of the value, but only if further acceptable stecTxrity is provided in addition to the mortgage.     The maximum advance to a Public Utility Society is two-thirds of value, or,  if collateral security is provided, three-quarters.Value is us ally assessed in advance by the District Valuer (Board of Inland Revenue).

PHILLIPS said that during March the unemployment figure fell by 112,000, and stood at 1,013,609 at the end of the month.    In the first week of April there was an Increase of 36,000, the first increase for a long time.    This was no doubt due to extended stoppages over Easter.    The increase in the number temporarily stopped was 56,000, so that even in this week there was a decrease of 20,000 In &quot;wholly unemployed&quot; and oasual classes.    This last inorease therefore, need not be taken as indicating any break in the improvement, which had now been proceeding almost continuously sinoe the end of last August.In answer to Sir A, Balfour, who pointed out that in iiarch there had been an increase of 150,000 in the number of persons receiving Poor Law relief, Mr. Phillips observed that the Poor Law figures included all the members of the household, and that to make them comparable with the Unemployment Benefit figures one had to reduce them very considerably, and, probably, divide them by 3.    Consequently the decrease in the Unemployment figures was by no means wholly neutralized by the rise in the Poor Law figures. The Ministry of Labour were, however, making inquiry to see how far the people disallowed unemployment benefit during a recent period went to the Guardians and got Poor Law relief.
The maximum period for repayment of a loanis 40 years in the case of a Company) and 50 yeai^s in the case of a Public Utility Society, but it cannot be assumed that the Commissioners will allow the maximum period.The rate of interest is at present 5 per cent,14.     Loans guaranteed under^the Trade Facillties Acts.In order to facilitate the employment of miners the Advisory Committee under the- Trade Facilities Acts, if satisfied with the security offered, can recommend the Treasury to guarantee a loan for housing.      Part V contains a note of cases where this has been done.Part iy.    Instances of Housing Schemes for Colliery; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&apos; Workers.15.     The Industrial Hc^sJ-hg^ Ltd *This is a special Housing Company registered under the Companies Acts.     It was formed in 1922 on the initiative of certain colliery companies for the purpose of constructing dwellings for the colliery workers, the shares being subscribed by the Colliery Companies.The constitution of the company satisfies the statutory conditions mentioned in paragraph 7(c) above and the Association are obtaining loans from the Public Works Loan Commissioners up to three-quarters of the value of the dwelling houses erected, and are also obtaining subsidy from the Ministry of Health under the Act of 1923 In respect of such of the houses as satisfy the subsidy conditions,,
(* fo T&quot;0 0 3Up to the present, proposals for the erection of 9,524 houses (8,116 of which rank for subsidy) have been approved by the Ministry.     6,800 houses have been completed.The houses when completed are leased to the Colliery Companies who let them to the miners and colliery officials.A statement giving details of the various schemes and the names of the Colliery Companies Interested is appended at the end of this memorandum, 16*     The Bolsover Colliery Housing, Company Ltd.This Company formed by the Bolsover Colliery Company Ltd. has undertaken the erection of 732 houses on three sites in the Rural Districts of Southwell and Skegby (Notts)  and is obtaining loans from the Public Works Loan Commissloners.     714 of the houses have been approved for subsidy under the Act of 1923.The subsidy is being paid directly by the Ministry of Health in respect of 125 house; j and in the case of the remainder the Company have applied to and obtained from the Local Authority the lump sum subsidy under the Act of 1923 as they prefer assistance in that form,-.353 houses have been completed to date.17,      Arley Coil iery^ C ompany Ltd .A scheme for the.erect ion of 250 houses at Arley in the Nuneaton (Warwickshire) Rural District has been approved by the Ministry for the purpose of a loan
from the Public Works Loan Commissioners.The Company are obtaining subsidy from the Local Authority under the Act of 1923. 18.     Chislet Colliery Housing SoQl ty,.Ljjd.A public Utility Society established for the provision of houses for employees of the Chislet Colliery &apos;Company.     A scheme for 300 houses at Chislet in the Blean (Kent)Rural District has been approved.     The Society have not proceeded With the application to the Ministry as they are obtaining subsidy from the Local Authority under the Act of 1923.20 houses have been built under this schemes 19.     New Kent Coalfield.A large number of the mines are in the Rural District of Eastry which embraces a considerable area of the South Eastern part of the County.     The Company are now sinking new pits and a large number of houses will shortly be needed.     The local Authority have been approached by the Colliery owners for assistance in making provision for housing the workers.     Realising that the proposal will involve the creation of new towns, the Council are much concerned to see that these towns are properly planned and provided with adequate drainage; and with a view to securing control over the development they are acting in co-operation with the East Kent Joint Town Planning Committee.   They have also enlisted the assistance and co-operation of the County Council.The proposal contemplated is that the District Council should acquire a site of some 500 acres and lay
it out for building by the construction of roads, sewers etc., and then lease about 100 acres   to a Development Company for 99 years at such rent as will cover the loan charges on the oost of land and works.The Development Company will be a Public Utility Society and will consist of representatives of the District Council, the County Council and the Colliery Company.     It is proposed that each of these bodies should put some money into the scheme, the remainder being borrowed from the Public Works Loan Commissioners.     A subsidy of  75 per house will be provided, under the Act of 1923, by the District Council, The Development Company will erect about 1,200 houses and lease them to the Colliery Company, who will let them to the miners at the same rents.The remainder of the area of 500 acres to be acquired will be available as sites for schools, churches^ shops, and for open spaces and allotments and for future development if necessary.Including the 1,200 houses to be provided by the Development Company it is contemplated that 3,500 houses will eventually be required.     At present the proposed arrangements for financing the balance of the houses are not known, but a loan of  200,000 is to be guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Acts,20,     Other Colliery Companies.There are no exact data of the housing activities of colliery companies other than those concerned
In the above schemes.    The Companies obtain subsidy (under the Act of 1923) through the Local Authority and their schemes are genei,ally dealt with by the Local Authorities without reference to the Ministry.It is, however, known from particulars supplied in connection with the schemes of Local Authorities for assisting private enterprise In building that considerable numbers of houses are being built by Colliery Companies under those schemes.For instance the scheme of the Easington (Co.Durham) Rural District Council, whose district includes a number of Important collieries, extends to a total of 3ome 2.300 houses, of which 1,179 have been completed,. Most of these houses are for colliery workers.    According to a statement supplied by the Council in 1925 they have undertaken to pay subsidy under the Act of 1923 in respect of inter alia the followingpropos als:-Easington Coal Company Ltd. 445 houses&apos;.-South Hetton Coal Company Ltd. 363 &quot;Londonderry Collieries Ltd. 95 &quot;Weardale Steel Coal &amp; Coke Co.Ltd. 225 &quot;&apos;Trimdon Coal Company Ltd. 60 &quot;Hcrclen Colliei&apos;-ies Ltdo 480 &quot;Scheme of private builder forerection of houses for sale toemployees of Horden CollieriesLtd.   (the Colliery Companylending part of the purchase money) 85
The District Council also are co-operating in the provision of houses for the miners.     They have a scheme for the erection by themselves of 550 houses, of which 456 have been completed.In some Colliery Districts an arrangement is made between the Local Authority and the Colliery Company under which the Company undertake to build a number of houses on condition that the Local Authority will build a like number. Under such an arrangement the R other harn Vale Colliery Ltd. , and the Dalton Main Company Ltd., are building 100 houses and 200 houses respectively with the aid of subsidy under the Act of 1923.Fart V.

An application for guarantee of a further loan of  97,500 for 250 houses is under consideration.(c) Messrs.  Pearson and Dorman Long, building in New Kent Coalfield.    A loan of  2,000,000 has been guaranteed, of which  200-000 Is for housing.    The projected number of houses is 3,500.      A further description of this scheme is contained in paragraph 19.- 1C -
