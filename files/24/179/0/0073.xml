This aecument is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos; s^GoverhmenihI desire to bring before the Cabinet the question of the Roman Catholic Relief Bill, introduced by Mr. Dennis Herbert, which obtained a Second Reading on the 15th March and was referred to a Standing Committee.      This Bill is practically identical with the Bill introduced last year by Mr. Blundell. The Prime Minister then asked the Home Affairs Committee to consider whether the Government should adopt Mr. Blundell&apos;s Bill,  and on the 6th February,  1925, I circulated a memorandum (C.P.70(25))  saying that in my opinion it would be most unwise for the Government to do so.      On the 9th February,  19S5, the Home Affairs Committee agreed to recommend to the Cabinet that &quot;in view of its controversial character the Roman Catholic Relief Bill should not be adopted by the Government&quot;..      This decision was endorsed by the Cabinet cn the 11th February. Accordingly the Bill of 1925 was blocked and I wrote a full letter to Mr. Blundell explaining that in my view a Bill such as this, whioh raises controversial questions in which large sections of the community are interested, ought not to obtain a Second Reading without a Debate in which tho general principles can be discussed.When Mr. Dennis Herbert introduced a similar Bill this Session, the Home Office instructed the Whips that the Bill should be blocked.      I understand, however,  that the block was not persisted in, as information was received from the promoter that the Prime Minister had no objection to the Bill.The Standing Committee which is to consider the Bill meets tomorrow (Wednesday, 28th April), but in view of the Cabinet decision of last year I do not propose to be present or to be represented on the&apos; Committee.      Before any Government representative takes part in the proceedings of the CommitteeP.172  (26)OUST.CABINET.ROMAN CATHOLIC RELIEF BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary
27.4.26.it is essential that the Cabinet should consider whether they do or do not adhere to their previous decision.A note is attached explaining the legal provisions which the Bill proposes to repeal.      Although many of these provisions have remained unenforced, it cannot he said that a proposal to repeal them would not arouse controversy.      I would call special attention in this connection to the provisions imposing disabilities on religious orders and to the provision rendering Roman Catholic processions illegal. As regards the latter provision, acute controversy arose in 1908 on the occasion of the Sucharistic procession in London.I would also call attention to the new Clause which is to be moved by Mr. Blundell for repealing the provision which disqualifies a Roman Catholic from holding the office of Lord Chancellor.      This is a highly controversial subject, and I personally should be strongly opposed to any proposal to alter the existing law.W.J.H.
Mote on the provisioncproposed to he repealed by the Roman Catholic Relief Bill.5 and 4 Edw. 6, c. 10.This Act forbids the keeping of books of church service other than those prescribed by the King and also the keeping of image s.1 Eliz. o. 24.(An Act to annex to the Crown certain religious houses and monasteries and to reform certain abuses in chantries).The object of this Act was mainly to confiscate and annex to the Crown certain religious houses dedicated to Roman Catholicism.I Geo.I St. 2.  0.50  (1715).An Aot for appointing Commissioners to enquire of the estates of certain traitors and of popish recusants and of estates to superstitious uses in order to raise money out of them severally for the use of the public.The main object of this Act was of a temporary character designed for the confiscation of estates of traitors and popish recusants after the 1715 Rebellion.As regards these three Acts the question arises whether a saving clause of some kind is required to cover acts done under them in order for example to prevent    claims in respect of property confiscated particularly from private individuals. The Act of 1 Eliz. c.24- also contains some special provisions  -about the Temple and the Church of St. Bartholomew, Smithfield, as to which it might be desirable to consult the Authorities concerned.
-z- 82811 Geo.2, 0.17, b.5.(An Act  ... for rendering the more effectual the Acts of Parliament made for vesting in two universities in that part of Great Britian called England the Presentations of Benefices belonging tc papists).Previous Acts passed in the reigns of James 1 (3 Jac.1.0.5) William and Mary (l Will. &amp; Mar. a.26) and Anne  (13 Ann. c.13) had provided that Roman Catholics could not present to benefices and if an advowson was in their possession the right to present should be exercised by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.They also prohibited a mortgagee or trustee for a papist from making a presentation.As will be observed from the preamble to the present Bill, it is not proposed to touch the earlier Statutes of James, William and Mary and Anne but only to repeal Section 5 of the Act of 11 Geo.2,  c.l? which is objected to because it prevents a Roman Catholic leaving an advowson by will or giving it to anybody during his lifetime.Section 5 of the Act of 11 Geo.2, c.17 does two things. One is to make a grant by a Roman Catholic of an advowson with-out consideration null and void.      The other is to prohibit a Roman Catholic from devising an advowson with intent to secure the benefit of it to his heirs or family.     The first prevision would apparently prohibit a Roman Catholic from making a free gift, however innocent, of an advowson to any other person irrespective of his belief.      The latter would prevent a Reman Catholic devising an advowson to one of his own family.      It would not apparently prevent him devising it to a Roman Catholic outside his family, nor apparently would it prevent an advowson from passing on in intestacy tc a Roman Catholic.S.17 of the Roman Catholic Relief Act, 1791.(51 Geo. Ill o.52).This Section prohibits the endowment or establishment of any religious order or Society of persons bound by monastic or religious vows or of any school, academy or college by persons professing the Roman Catholic religion &quot;within these realms or
the dominions &quot;belonging thereto&quot;;    it also declares &quot;that all &apos; uses, trusts and dispositions whether of real or personal property which immediately before the said 24th June, 1791, shall be deemed to be superstitious or unlawful shall continue to be so deemed and taken anything in this Act contained notwithstanding.&quot;As to the first of these provisions see the note below on 2 &amp;. 3 William IV. 0.115.The effect of the second provision as to trusts and dispositions    appears to have been practically nullified by the decision of the House of Lords in Bourne v. Keane  (1918) A.C.815.S.1I of the Roman Catholic Relief Aot, 1791.   (51 Geo.IIX,c.52). S.26 of the Roman Catholio Relief Aot, 1829.   (10 Geo.IV. c.7).The repeal of these Sections will remove the present prohibition of Roman Catholio processions.Section 11 of the 1791 Aot excludes from the benefits conferred by that Aot any Roman Catholic Sooxesiastio wearing the habits of his order save in a place of congregation or worship or in a private house.      section 26 of the 1829 Aot  (which appears to have taken the place of Soil of the Aot of 179i), prohibits the wearing of ecclesiastical habits and the exercising of the rites and ceremonies of the Roman Catholio religion in public *Sections 28-56 of the Roman Catholic Relief Act1829   (10 Geo.IV, c.7) 6- Section 4 of the Roman Catholio Chantries Act,  1852, 2 &amp; 3 Will IV.  q.115,   5.4) --&quot;  &apos; -   :The Sections of tho Act of 1829 provide that &quot;whereasJesuits, and members of other religious orders, communities orsocieties of the Church of Rome, bound, by monastic or religiousvows, are resident within the United Kingdom;    and it is expedient to make provisions for the gradual  suppression and final prohibi-tion of the same therein&quot;(a) every member of such order shall deliver to the Clerk   :of the Peace of the County where he resides a notice giving his name, place of birth, the name of the order to which hebelongs,, etc., and the Clerk shall transmit the same to the
Secretary of State;(b) if any member of such religious order (other than a British subject) shall after the commencement of this Act come into this realm he shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and liable on conviction to banishment for life;(c) the Secretary of State may grant a licence to any member of a religious order to oome into the United Kingdom and remain here for specified periods;(d) an account of all such licences shall be laid before Parliamentj(e) any member of such religious order admitting any person to the order shall be guilty of a misdemeanourj(f) any person who after the commencement of the Act shall be admitted to or become a member of such order shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and on conviction be liable to banishment for life;(g) any person who does not obey an order of banishment shall be liable to transportation for life;(h) none of these provisions shall apply to female religious orders.The obvious intention   of these provisions was that all monastic orders would become extinct in the United Kingdom as the then existing members died out.These provisions have never been put into force, and Sir James Stephens in his History of the Criminal Law says, &quot;These provisions ever since they have been passed have been treated as an absolutlay dead letter&quot; .In 1902 the Protestant Alliance applied to the Metropolitan Police Magistrate at Marlborough Street for summonses against three well -known Jesuits under the Act of 1829, but the Magistrate refused to grant the summonses on the ground that the Information was too scanty.     He also took into consideration the fact that the Act of 1829 had been, in practice, a dead letter.      Tho case was taken on a mandamus to the High Court  (Rex. v. Kennedy, Law Times Reports 1903; volume 18, page 557) and the High Court
upheld the Magistrate&apos;s decision on the ground that he had exercised a discretion in the matter which was given to him by law, and it was not for the Court to interfere.7 &amp; 8 Vic, c.97,  b.15.As this provision relates to Northern Ireland it must be omitted from the Bill as it concerns a matter within the jurisdiction of the Government of Northern Ireland.25 &amp; 24 Vic, c.154,  s.7.Section 7.    &quot;Nothing in this Act contained shall be taken to repeal or in any way alter any provision of the Roman Catholic Relief Act, 1829, respecting the suppression or prohibition of the religious orders or Societies of the Church of Rome bound by monastic or religious vows&quot;.Northern Ireland.As the Bill should clearly not apply to Northern Ireland an amendment should be moved to exclude Northern Ireland from its scope.
