[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the1 Cabinet.    March 1926.SECRET.1CP. 103 (26).CABINET.GOVERNMENT LANDS AND BUILDINGS.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I CIRCULATE herewith a memorandum by the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury on the subject of Government Lands and Buildings-and recommend that the Cabinet should approve the scheme proposed therein.W. S. C. .Treasury Chambers, S.W. LMarch 10, 1926. - ;v; - -Government Lands and Buildings.1. In 1922 a Committee, of which Sir Howard Frank was Chairman, reported in favour of the concentration in one Department of the business involved (1) in the purchase and sale of land and -buildings.and .(2) in estate management of Government property. The Committee recommended that all professional surveying and valuing staffs in Government Departments (with minor exceptions) should be amalgamated in a Central Lands Department; that all professional work in connection with valuation, -purchase and sale, &amp;o, of land and buildings should be undertaken by this new department acting as agent for the purchasing&quot; or selling department ; and that the new department should also be entrusted with the management of Government lands so far as it consists of estate management in the usual sense of the term.2. . These recommendations were referred to the Departments primarily concerned, ; and it became apparent at. once that there was strong departmental opposition to many of the Oommittee&apos;s proposals. The Government decided accordingly that the best plan would be to endeavour to give effect to the Frank Committee recommenda-tions .by stages, and at the outset to concentrate on a reorganisation of the present arrangements for valuation, sale and purchase the question of setting up a central organisation for: estate management being left in abeyance until experience could be gainedx-of the advantages of a central organisation for valuation, sale and purchase!.3. An Inter-departmental Committee was consequently appointed to work out. a scheme on this basis, and in due course this Committee submitted its report. ;- -4. No action has so far been taken on the Committee&apos;s recommendations, the late Government deciding that it was inopportune at that time to make the changes proposed.5. The three Departments mainly involved in this business are the Valuation Office of the Inland Revenue, which, in addition to purely revenue business, is already acting as the agent of Government Departments generally in the sphere of valuation and negotiation for sale and purchase of property ; &quot;the Lands Branch of the War Office, which, in addition to its War Office business, is acting as agent in these matters for the Air Ministry and the Surplus Stores Disposal Department; and the Office of Works. Of these three the Inland Revenue Valuation Office is much the largest, and is organised in Districts all over Great Britain. [14306JCopy No. 3Q
6. Whilst I am strongly in favour of the plan for concentrating in a single organisation the whole of the work connected with valuation, and the purchase and sale of Government land and buildings, I doubt whether it would be expedient to attempt at the same time to put into force the much more difficult and debatable plan of making the same organisation responsible for the estate management of Government properties. It was this part of the Frank Committee&apos;s scheme to which Departments took the strongest exception when the report was first published ; and the recom-mendation in the report that officers of the central organisation responsible for the management of properties held by the Service Departments should be seconded to those Departments for the time being would appear to indicate that the Committee itself foresaw serious difficulty in giving effect to any plan which might appear to transfer from the Departments primarily concerned to the new central organisation functions in the sphere of management and administration for which the Ministers in charge of those Departments could at no time disclaim responsibility. Not only so, but the duties involved in the management of the extraordinarily diverse properties held by the Government are in many respects highly specialised, requiring for their due performance departmental experience in an almost higher degree than the possession of the professional qualifications of the Valuer and Surveyor.7. The business of buying and selling properties, on the other hand, is all ejusdem generis, and, provided that the final decision as to the properties to be bought and sold and as to the price to be paid or received rests, subject to Treasury sanction, with the owner Department, there is much to be said for a central organisation to handle this side of the business.8. A scheme on these lines has already been worked out in some detail by the Inter-departmental committee referred to above. The only substantial change in that scheme that I now recommend is the substitution of the already existing Inland Revenue organisation for the new independent central organisation proposed in the original plan. Under this arrangement the valuation staff of the Inland Revenue Department would deal not only with questions of valuation for purposes of taxation, sanctioning of borrowing and advances by the State, but also, acting as agents for Government Departments generally, with the whole of the work falling under the head of valuation and negotiation for sale and p irchuse of Government properties. I make this suggestion for two reasons : (a.) Already the Inland Revenue valuation organisation has developed a long way in this direction, and now undertakes valuations and negotiations for many Departments ; the present proposal would therefore only round off and formally recognise a position which has been largely reached by a natural development;(6.) The setting-up of a new Department or Board would be likely to involve additional charges for management and secretarial work which would be avoided if the staff remains under the Inland Revenue.9. A particular difficulty arises in regard to the method of dealing with short-term hirings and lettings. Probably the most convenient arrangement in these cases would be to allow the Departments primarily concerned to deal directly instead of through the Valuation Office with hirings and lettings for periods up to seven years, and exceptionally (as in the case of the hirings and lettings dealt with by the Office of Works) for periods up to twenty-one years. The difficulty of referring short hiring and letting transactions to a central organisation arises from the fact that in these cases questions of accommodation and engineering and architectural problems are inextricably involved in the process of negotiation, and that in the majority of such cases it is clearly convenient that the same professional officer should deal with the business in all its aspects from first to last.
