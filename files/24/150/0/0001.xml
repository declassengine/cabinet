As full an account as possible is given of the constantly changing situation, as reported through official sources and Berlin Wireless. A few comments have been added to the daily diaiy, which merits attention.The present German policy seems to be to maintain constantly and. vociferously that power no longer lies with the parties responsible for the Avar. There are no signs or expressions of repentance, from those now claiming to govern, for haying-given their: whole-hearted-support to the war policy for over four years until, the Associated Powers defeated the armed forces of Germany.Special attention is drawn to the divergence between. British official and German Wireless reports of the situation, especially to Sir W. Townley&apos;s report of November 20th, given on page 9. Also to the offer of food to Germany by the Bolshevists of Russia, and the German refusal, which was made on the plea of the promise of food by the Allies and -Russian shortage.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Sinkings. The Ministry ol! Shipping reports that during the week ended November 2nd one British vessel of over 500 tons gross was sunk by enemy action. Three were lost by marine risk, making a total loss of 10,S35 gross tons.Prisoners of War and interned Civilians. (1) Germany. The captain of the camp at Rnhleben informed Sir W. Townley on November .10th that the camp was under the supervision of the Soldiers&apos; Council, who have promised to make the lot of the prisoners as light as possible. The men are well and quiet. (In November 15th Sir W. Townley forwarded a declaration issued by the Berlin Workers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Council to the effect that every opportunity would be given to prisoners to return home on the conclusion of peace, and that meanwhile they would be humanely treated. Prisoners were advised to remain at their occupations until the time of their release.On November 17th Sir W. Townley reported that arrangements had been made with an officer of the General Staff whereby British officers are to proceed to three fixed points on the Dutch frontier, where they will meet British prisoners returning from Germany.The Foreign Office learns that there is a serious epidemic of influenza in the camps at Mannheim and Cassel.On November 20th the British Government sent a wireless telegraph message to the German Government protesting against the deplorable condition in which British prisoners are being sent back to the Allied lines. Unless adequate arrangements are made to relieve this suffering, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be compelled to take the matter into account in any question of revictualling Germany.(2) Austria-Hungary. Sir If. Rumbold has been instructed to make every effort to secure the repatriation of British prisoners of war and interned civilians under the terms of the armistice. The British Commanders on the Italian and Macedonian fronts have received similar instructions.   General Diaz has been requested to help.(3) Holland. To a telegram from the Foreign Office stating that the British Government was not prepared to agree to the repatriation of German combatants and civilians in Holland, except in accordance with the Agreements in force before the armistice, Sir W. Townley replied that the Minister of Foreign Affairs had only con-sented to the release of British prisoners of war and interned civilians on condition that Germans were released likewise. Sir \V. Townley considered that it was impossible to make any alteration in these arrangements. The transport of British prisoners to England had already begun, and German prisoners were in all probability also leaving the country. Any hitch in the arrangements would produce a strong feeling of discontent among the British prisoners, many of whom already considered they had a grievance against the Government. Sir W. Townley Avas instructed not to press the matter further.On November 18th, Sir W. Townley was able to report that the last remaining civilians in Holland would sail to Hull on November 20th.Successful arrangements have been made for a daily railway service and the hire of Dutch river tonnage for the transport of prisoners to Rotterdam.(4) Switzerland. Sir IT. Rumbold has been asked to notify the Swiss Govern-ment that a]l British prisoners of war and interned civilians are to be repatriated under the terms of the armistice.If any difficulty is raised by the Swiss Government with regard to their repatriation unless German prisoners of war are also repatriated, Sir 1:1. Rumbold is authorised to agree to the Germans leaving.
(5) Denmark. The repatriation of all-British prisoners of war has been agreed to. The Minister of Foreign Affairs expressed his satisfaction that His Majesty&apos;s Government would allow the repatriation of German prisoners, as the latter had begun to form Soldiers&apos; Councils.Representatives of the Danish Red Cross have left for Germany to assist in the departure of British prisoners, and Danish surgeons and nurses have offered their services at Copenhagen.(b) Russia. The Swedish Red Cross is acting as intermediary for distributing-food to prisoners in Petrograd.Tlie. Channel Route. The Foreign Office has requested His Majesty&apos;s Representatives to inform the neutral Governments to which they are accredited that the Admiralty anticipates that the Channel route will be swept, lighted and buoyed in the near future.   Its use is to be encouraged.Allied group.BELGIUM.Internal Condition. Sir W. Townley (The Hague) learns from a reliable source that a state of anarchy prevails at Liege. German soldiers are plundering the city. German troops are conducting themselves in a similar manner in Brussels and its vicinity.Reconstruction. Lord Derby reports on November - 15th that the French government has signified its desire to facilitate the reconstruction of Belgium and is prepared to open a credit of 100,000,000 francs for the placing of Belgian orders in France.BRAZIL.Liquidation of German Banks. The Foreign Office has asked Mr. Barclay to request the Government of the United States to obtain from the Brazilian Govern-ment a categorical answer as to whether Allied organisation may be allowed to take over the business of the German Banks and whether any action is to be taken with regard to other German firms.   (Vide Report No. 94.)Sir A. Peel learns from the Manager of the London and Brazilian Bank that German banking will be resumed in some form, though business at present is at a standstill.CHINA.Duties as Go-Ballir/reference^-Slv J. Jordan reported on November .12th that the Chinese Government, in compliance with the aide-memoire handed to the President, had taken steps to liquidate German banks and intern German subjects.Internal Situation. On October 30th His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs received a communication from A7iscount Chinda expressing the Japanese Governments conviction that the Governments of Japan, Great Britain, France, Italy, and the United States should make a joint representation to the leaders of the North and South with a view to establishing peace and unity in China.
CUBA.Strikes. Mr. Leech reports that, the Federated Unions joined the stevedores&apos; strike and that a complete stoppage of the industrial and public services throughout the island became imminent. As a result the President pardoned the convicted leader which constitutes a triumph for the Union. Mr. Barclay reports on November 14th that the United States Government will not allow the situation to get out of hand.FRANCE.Congratulations on the Armistice. On November 13th, Lord Derby asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs to accept on behalf of the French Government the British Governments congratulations on the signing of the Armistice. On November 15th, Monsieur Clemenceau accompanied by leading members o  the French Government visited Lord Derby at the British Embassy. The proceedings were characterised by the utmost, cordiality and Lord Derby considers the visit a striking and unique compliment to the British Nation. In an article entitled &quot;England and Peace &quot;the Temps pays tribute to England and Franco-British solidarity, and declares that the fundamental conditions of a League of Nations must be to preserve Great Britain&apos;s maritime supremacy and the newly-won National unity of France.President Wilson and tlie United States. The Army Commission of the Chamber has decided to submit to Parliament the following resolution: &quot; President Wilson and the American nation, the Allied nations and the heads of States have deserved well of humanity.&quot; The Socialist Deputy, Marcel Sembat in the TIanse deplores the inclusion of the Allies in the above resolution. The Allies, he holds, were defending themselves against a direct menace of a German militarist Empire, while the entry of the United States into the Alliance had the character of a Crusade for the establishment of Justice and Liberty.Numerous articles have appeared in the Press warning the Allies against, being-moved by the German appeals to President Wilson.The Kaiser. Lord Derby reports that French public opinion is increasingly insistent that the Kaiser should be tried and punished. Articles to this effect have appeared in the Temps and Matin.Monsieur Clemenceau and Labour. On November 17th M. Clemenceau received a Delegation of the Confederation Generale de Travail. Lord Derby reports that the Delegation is quite satisfied with the assurances given them to the effect that workmen sent from workshops will be returned to them at once, and that, persons condemned for strikes will be released. M. Clemenceau assured the Delegation that the aspirations of labour organisations would be given every possible satisfaction.Sir J. Jordan reported on November 13th that General Hsu Shu Cheng had gone to Japan for the ostensible purpose of attending army manoeuvres. He thinks the reason of the visit is to extend the scope of the existing Chino-Japanese Military Agreement though rumour speaks of a definite alliance.The Opium Question. Sir J. Jordan reports on November 18th that he had an interview with tlie President at which he discussed the whole opium question. Since the Agreement of 1015 business had been carried on between Chinese officials and British opium merchants, who were both wholly corrupt, culminating in the present situation at Shanghai and the exorbitant prices prevailing there. Sir J. Jordan pointed out that if this state of affairs continued there would be a recrudescence of poppy cultivation throughout China. The President declared that he had ordered the stoppage of further sales at Shanghai, but that he was embarrassed by tlie huge financial obligations handed down by the previous administration. On November 19th Sir J. Jordan was able to report that at a meeting of the Cabinet it was decided to burn publicly the stocks of opium at Shanghai.
Alsace-Lorraine. Lord Derby reports that a &quot; Commissary of the Republic &quot; is to be sent to each of the administrative divisions of Basse Alsace, Haute Alsace and Lorraine.Sir H. Rurabold (Berne), learns that all the German officials of Alsace-Lorraine have been withdrawn together with the Administrative records, and that the inhabitants of Alsatian towns are demanding unconditional restoration to France.On November 17th an enthusiastic demonstration took place celebrating the return to France of Alsace-Lorraine. The President, in an eloquent speech, said that a plebiscite was unnecessary, since the people themselves had already shown that they desired restitution pure and simple. The Socialist Deputy, Marcel Sembat, takes occasion to insist that the interests of the population must not suffer from their reunion with France. Me predicts that during the period of transition Alsace-Lorraine will enjoy a kind of autonomy within the French Republic.GUATEMALA.Peace. Mr. Young reports on November 13th that the conclusion of the Armistice was celebrated with great enthusiasm.ITALY.The King. On the King&apos;s arrival in Rome on the morning of November 14th he &apos; was accorded a magnificent welcome.The Austrian Fleet. On November 10th it was reported through the wireless stations of the Italian Government that, according to the additional terms of the Armistice, the Austrian fleet was at Venice.On November 17th Sir R. Rodd reported that the Italian Government had agreed to the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government for the utilisation of the Austro-liungarian mercantile fleet.Occupation of Fiume. Sir R. Rodd reports that an Italian infantry brigade is being sent to Fiume, and points out the danger of a collision with the two Serbian battalions which had already arrived there before November lGth.The British Government has been requested by the Italian Government to despatch small contingents of British troops to participate in the occupation of Fiume and Cattaro. This request is being acceded to, and Lord Derby has been asked by the Foreign Office to urge M. Trumbitch to maintain order among the Jugo-Slavs in view of the Allied occupation. It is significant of Jugo-Slav feeling, towards the Italians that M. Pavitcliitch begged Sir C. des Graz to ask His Majesty&apos;s Goveru-rnent to land men at places on the Dalmatian coast occupied by Italians. M. Korosets and Dr. Cingua, members of the A gram National Council, spoke to Lord Derby to the same effect and avowed thei)- suspicions of Italian intentions. Lord Cavan has been instructed to send troops to Fiume if General Diaz insists upon such a course.mOccupation of Pola. It appears from a report of the British Naval Attache at Rome that the Jugo-Slav element at Pola is in a state of anarchy. Admiral Komack, the Jugo-Slav Commandant, confessed that, he had little power over his men who had formed themselves into Soviets. The Italians had occupied the forts commanding the harbour (vide Report No. 93) and the Naval Attache accompanied Admiral Cagni on board the two remaining Dreadnoughts in Jngo-Slav hands, taking possession of them in the name of the Allied Governments and the United States. Lord Derby in a telegram dated November 10th alludes to the necessity of joint action on the part of the Allies, if friction between the Jugo-Slavs and the Italians is to be avoided.Albania. Sir R. Rodd has been instructed to represent to the Italian Government that no action should be taken with regard to the future of Albania pending a decisionGS17-3b li
by the Peace Conference. It is proposed to send a British Military Representative to Albania.Supplies for Prisoners. Sir R. Rodd in a telegram dated November 18th emphasises the necessity of forwarding all available supplies to the war zone for the relief of prisoners who are returning in a desperate condition from Austria. Other-wise he fears that Bolshevism maj7 take root among them.PANAMA.Negro Aspirations. The Association of the Universal Loyal Negroes of Panama have requested Sir C. Mallet to transmit to Mr. Lloj^d George the congratulations of the negroes of the Panama Republic on the Allied victory, and to beg that, in return for the services rendered by negroes in the war, the former German possessions in Africa may be constituted the negro national home with self-government.UNITED STATES.Modification of Trade Eeslrictions.-Mi: Barclay reports on November .13th that the restrictions on non-essential industries have been modified. Precedence is to be given to the pi-oduction of cargo ships. Mr. Hurley has made a statement to the effect that, the shipbuilding programme will be carried out according to the plans formed for the war. The President, has ordered the draft of 296.000 men begun on November 11th to be cancelled.Oil Companies in Mexico. Mr. Polk has informed Mr. Barclay that the United States Government will support oil companies against confiscation when all legal remedies in the Mexican Courts have failed.British Day. December 7th has been chosen for a unique pro-British demon-stration. Mr. Barclay states that it is entirely American in its conception and organisation, and hopes that prominent members of the Government and the Army may be sent to represent Great Britain.Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s Speech. The Prime Ministers speech delivered on November 1.1th has met with the general approval of the Press and administrative circles.President Wilsou&apos;s Visit to Europe. It is officially announced that the President, will go to Europe immediately after the Regular Session of Congress which takes place on December 2nd.   It is considered probable that he will visit England later.Mr. Oompers on Labour. Mr. Gompers, who took part at a Conference at, Laredo, stated that the advantages gained by the workers of America and Allied countries during the Avar must be retained. Mr. Barclay considers this a warning to employers not to attempt a reduction in wages even in the event of a fall in prices.
ENEMY GKOUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Internal Condition. Telegrams continue to lay stress on the serious food conditions. Sir H. Rumbold has been asked to repeat a Note addressed previously to the Allied Governments by the Austrian Government, which states that famine threatens Vienna and asks permission for a number of Austro-Hungarian vessels to fetch supplies from the American continent. On November 13th Sir H. Rumbold reported that the Austrian Legation at Berne had received from Vienna the outline of a scheme for importing supplies into Austria-Hungary under Allied supervision. On the 18th he received a message from the Austrian Legation to the effect that there was only sufficient coal in Vienna to last a few days. The Austrian Authorities hoped that the Czechs might be induced to release some coal, of which there was a large quantity available for Vienna. Mr. Barclay reported on November 19th that, pending the arrival in Europe of Mr. Hoover and Mr. Hurley, Avhen the matter would be fully discussed, the Government of the United States suggested the employment of a portion of Austrian-German tonnage, under the direction of the Shipping Board, for the transport of foodstuffs to Austria.,On November 18th Sir H. Rumbold reported that His Majesty&apos;s Consul at St. Gall had visited Voralberg in order to ascertain the food situation. There are no supplies of flour left. The Swiss Government is prepared to forward supplies if the Entente Governments ensure their replacement to which the French Government has agreed. He states that absolute order reigns and that soldiers from the front are returning peaceably to their homes. On the other hand, Sir H. Rumbold learns that Russian and Italian prisoners of war have left their camps and are pillaging the country, while Austro-Hungarian soldiers returning from the front through Linz are completely uncontrolled by their officers, many of Avhom they have assaulted. The Argentine Minister at Vienna has recommended the presence of Allied troops at Vienna for the maintenance of order. A manifesto has been transmitted through the wireless stations of the Russian Government in the name of the Russian Avorkers, soldiers, and peasants, calling upon their Austrian comrades to place no hope either upon their own bourgeoisie or upon Entente capitalists.Disintegration of the Dual Monarchy. (1) German-Austria. On November loth it Avas reported through the wireless stations of the German Government that Bauer, the Under Secretary of State in Vienna, had addressed a telegram to Herr Haase in which an appeal Avas made for union between Germany and German-Austria and for German assistance in the hour of Austria&apos;s need. A campaigu with this union as its object is being conducted by the Prussian Press.It is reported through the Wireless stations of the German Government that the German-Austrians residing in Berlin held a meeting on November 17th, and passed a resolution to the effect that simultaneous elections should be held in germany and those regions of Austria Avhere German is spoken, in order finally to bring about a united great-German National Republic by means of a Constitutional National Assembly.(2) Hungary -Sir H. Rumbold has had an interview with M. Valyi, who considers that the future of Austria-Hungary lies in a Danubian Confederation without the inclusion of German Austria, which could secure its economic existence by union with Germany. He would like to see the Slovaks and the Rumanians of Transylvania included in Hungary. He suggested that such a settlement could only be brought about under British auspices.It was learnt at Copenhagen on November 18th that a Hungarian Republic had been proclaimed.   The King abdicated on November 13th.(3) Bohemia. -Professor Mararyk has been chosen as President of the Czecho--SloA^ak Republic.   The first Prime Minister is Dr. Kramarsch.(1) Jugo-Slacia. Lord Derby forwarded on November 17th a communication from Sir Arthur Evans to the effect that the position of the common Serbo-Jugo-Slav Government established by the Pact of Geneva has been consolidated.
GERMANY.General. There has been a tremendous recrudescence of German Wireless propaganda on a scale unprecedented during the past year. The week began with the predicted &quot; sympathy campaign &quot; in ifnll blast, and the chief object was evidently to obtain a modification of&apos; the Armistice terms, on the plea that they would cause a famine amongst German women and children. These appeals are dealt with-under &quot;Peace Discussions,&quot; on page 15.&apos; An anti-climax was reached in the appeal by Herr Solf to America to obtain a modification of the Turkish armistice clause providing for the repatriation of German civilians. A claim was made that, all German civilians should remain (compare lierr Dernburg&apos;s triumphant statements last summer about German economic penetration in the East), using the plea that some of them would be caring for orphans of: Armenians for whose slaughter the moral responsibility falls upon Germany. As usual German deeds marred the moral force of German words. The cruel brutality to prisoners of war, especially to the British, was maintained to the last possible moment. During the whole week much energy has been expended upon representing that a stable form of government already exists, and that there is no danger of Bolshevism the dominance of one class over all others by the slaughter of all who disagree with their tenets. Much depends upon the attitude of the demobilised soldiers. There is an acute difference between the statements in German and Russian Wireless about future prospects. The return of M. Jolfe to Berlin has been refused, and steps taken to guard the Eastern Frontier against &quot; bands of vagabonds.&quot;official Information. On account of constant changes in the situation it is proposed to continue for the present the system adopted last week of giving in diary form a precis of the information received daily.November 4ili, received lltli. Lord Acton forwarded reports that the new Government got rid of Ludendorff for fear that he. might have.supported a Pan-German coup d&apos;etat. The Pan-Germans were then working with the General Staff. An open breach between Prussia and Bavaria was considered improbable. The Kaiser was loathed in Bavaria.November 11th. The late Herr Ballin was credited with the opinion that his shipping company required substantial State aid to avoid bankruptcy. He feared an outbreak of Bolshevism (Sir H. Rumbold). The internment on parole in Holland of the military members of the ex-Kaiser&apos;s suite was reported (Sir W. Townley). The Munich revolution was reported to have been bloodless excepting that soldiers had shot some officers (Sir H. Rumbold). Violent demonstrations against Prussia had occurred in the Southern States. Agitation against the new Government had taken place in Berlin, attributable to the military disaster and shortage of food. Bolshevists and the Spartacus Group were active in propaganda, but the agitation was little connected with them. The attempts by the Conservative party to raise the National Defence issiie had failed miserably, and only increased the hostility of the people towards the military party. , Much looting and brigandage by soldiers during the retreat was reported (through Sir H. Rumbold).2\ovember T2th. Manoeuvres were reported to exploit, via Switzerland, the demooratisation of Bavaria, in order to try to tone down the terms of the Armistice. Fears were expressed about the result of the return of the &quot; undisciplined &quot; soldiers in large numbers from the front (Sir H. Rumbold).On November 13/7*. the communication appealing through the Swiss Legation to President Wilson on November 12th for food and reply were reported by Mr. Barclay (see under &quot;Peace Discussions&quot;). A report was received vid Berne that Bolshevists had got the upper hand in Berlin, and the reactionary parties (Prussian J imkers and reactionary magnates) would not be averse from such a condition of affairs, hoping that the restoration of order would be undertaken by the Allied troops in the interests of the people who brought about the war (Sir II. Rumbold, avIio warns that the information is infected at the source). The flight of the Crown Prince to Holland was reported ; his suite had been interned (Sir W. Townley).On November 15th slackness amongst German soldiers, especially in saluting officers, was reported. The railway department of the General Staff was in a disorganised state. Hindenburg was still popular. Admission of the dastardly crime towards Belgium was becoming general in Germany. The military authorities had deceived the people until the last moment about the situation.   A desire on
behalf of a Minority Socialist to explain-personally the situation in Germany to Allied representatives in Switzerland was reported (Sir IT. Rumbold).November 16th. While making appeals to the humanity of their enemies, the German Government was instructing their diplomatic representatives in Switzerland to foment disorders in France and Italy (Sir II. Rumbold). Lord Derby called attention to an article in the Temps, pointing out that, much time must elapse before a stable democratic government, can be constituted in Berlin. Germany cannot be expected to &quot; democratise herself &quot; all at once and in a moment. Immediate action is recommended to prevent the annexation of German-Austria &quot;otherwise the German revolution may found the Mittel-Europa dreamed of by William.&quot;November 17th. From information received from Sir W. Townley and said to emanate from Herr Solf, it appeared that the Berlin situation was not as publicly represented. Extremists might get the upper hand, and it was they who were trying to get M. Joffe back from Russia. (The report of Jofle&apos;s return to Berlin in last \veek&apos;s report is unconfirmed ; according to Russian Wireless he is still in Russia trying to get back. Whether he does so or not will be a definite test of the prospect of the Bolshevists getting the upper hand in Berlin.) The ex-Kaiser had used in conversation expressions that might indicate his belief that he had not lost his throne permanently. Rumours are prevalent that he carried oft&apos; 30,00(),000L with him. (Sir W. Townley.)November 18i/;.. Sehoidemann was reported on good authority to have lost all influence. It appeared that the General Staff were entering into a regular convention of a military nature with the Bolshevists (Lord Kilmarnock). Reports were received of the flight of German line of communication supply troops, upon whom the orderly retreat of the armies depends (Sir H. Rumbold). Steps are being taken to collect information from Norway and Sweden about outrages perpetrated by German U-boats (Mr. Ovey, Christiania).On November 20lli Sir W. Townley reported on good authority that,German reports about the orderly retirement of their armies are false. There is indescribable disorder and distress. Deep hatred is nourished, especially against England. &quot; Republicanism &quot; in Germany is reported to be a sham, intended to mislead.Berlin Wireless Reports. German Wireless stations are launching such heavy masses of words upon the world that it is difficult to extract definite information of value from the voluminous messages. The perpetual assertions that the revolution has been effected smoothly, and that a stable government has been established for the whole of Germany seem to indicate an undercurrent of fear of Bolshevism. So far, the abdication of the Kaiser seems only to have taken the form of a decree issued by Prince Max as Imperial Chancellor on November 9th, in which Deputy Ebert&apos;s appointment as &quot;Imperial&quot; Chancellor was also announced. On the same day the &quot; Trans-Ocean Company, Berlin,&quot; on taking over Berlin Wireless news, claimed to repudiate all propaganda service, and to depend upon no individual branch of German political and economic life. &quot; Chancellor &quot; Ebert issued a proclamation on November 10///. On November 11th the Nauen Wireless Station was reported to be in the hands of the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council. On November \ Zlh the &quot; German General Government &quot; stated that all large and medium sized towns were ruled by Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils, and appealed to the country people to form peasant councils. The &quot; People&apos;s Government. &quot; issued an appeal to the Army and the Navy. On November 1-lth the &quot; Prussian Government &quot; confiscated Crown property (not personal). The &quot; German Socialist Coalition Cabinet &quot; was referred to, also the &quot; Council of the People&apos;s Commissaries, Berlin &quot; (in a message from Russia). &apos; The Vorwarts explained that in. the German Republic the motto will lie &quot; the whole power to the whole people,&quot; not &quot; the whole power to the Soviets.&quot; On November 15th, the &quot; Executive Committee of the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council &quot; stopped the formation of Red&apos; Guards. The &quot;Prussian people&apos;s Government&quot; announced the intention of Prussia to &quot; become as speedily as possible a complete democratic part of the United People&apos;s Republic.&quot; Elections for a constituent assembly were announced &quot; on the basis of equal suffrage for all men and women with the proportional system.&quot; (On subsequent days all the States and Grand Duchies followed and hastily democratised.) The &quot;Supreme Army Administration &quot; (late Great General Staff?) issued orders to the armies about demobilisation.   TheOS 17 3!) 0

The &quot; Prussian Government &quot; was stated to have taken over the business of State &quot; at the recpiest of the Executive Committe of the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council.&quot; Hindenburg announced that now. as heretofore, he stands at the head of the Chief Army. On November LGth the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council announced to enemy countries that German workmen and soldiers freed Germany and appealed to the workmen of enemy countries. The appeal ends. &quot; Long live the International Revolutionary Socialism ! &quot; [The fact is not mentioned that the soldiers fought hard to prevent the success of the Entente armies who &quot;freed Germany,&quot; and that the workmen supported them.] The internment at Borisov of the Bolshevist Embassy was reported by Russian Wireless on this date. On November 17th the &quot; Provisional Government, of the Republic of Prussia&quot; is mentioned. Herr Ebert appealed to delegates of all the Soldiers&apos; Councils for calmness, order, and means of transport to avoid anarchy, which would cause the enemy to &quot;dictate conditions which will completely destroy German economic life.&quot; Democratisation reports are published from .Schaumburg Lippe, Puidolstadt, Coburg, and Saxon Altenbnrg. The abolition of the Prussian Upper Chamber and Second Chamber was announced, also the Reichstag elected in 1912, and the Federal Council &quot;in its character as a legislative body.&quot; On November ISth the Prussian National Government objected to the sentences of Courts of Law being submitted to Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils for approval. The abolition of the office of Chancellor &quot;for all time&quot; was announced. The formation of Provisional Democratic Governments in almost all Federal States was announced, and Berlin was called the &quot; State Capital.&quot; The flight of the lino of communication supply troops was confirmed. On November IQtlt, the German Government announced that the Soviet Government (Russian Bolshevists) had been told that it is not desirable that it should be represented in Berlin for the present. Press appeals against Bolshevism were published. Ebert &quot; who together with the Independent Social Democrat, Haase, presides over the &apos; Council of the People&apos;s Com-missaries &apos; (sic) &quot; gave an interview to the Trans-Ocean (Wireless) News Service. The formation of a &quot;Home Command in-the East&quot; is announced to protect the German population both from Polish enemies and from &quot; bands of vagabonds.&quot; A. message was sentj to NTewton 1). Baker at Washington that the Liebknecht-Rosa Luxemburg group demanded a dictatorship by the proletariat, while the members&apos; of the Government desired &quot;Government for, of, and by, the whole people. The soldiers stand by the second idea .... the severest test is to come when the returning soldiers come home.&quot; Herr Scheidemann announced that the election lists for the National Assembly will be published on January 2nd.   Objections may be* State Secretary Erzberger will conduct preliminaries of peace negotiations in conjunction with the Poreign Office.f Signed Jos. Danziger.
NEUTEAL GROUP.THE BALTIC PROVINCES.Aid against Bolshevism. Numerous appeals and suggestions have been made for Entente intervention in consequence of the departure of the German troops from the Baltic Provinces. It appears to be the general opinion that the presence of British Avarships in the Baltic would have a steadying effect.The Committee of the Libau Exchange (Courland) has appealed to the Govern-ments of the United States, Great Britain and France, through the Political Department of the Swiss Government, for protection against the Bolshevist clanger. Mr. Clive reported on November 15th that a refugee from Reval, claiming to represent the bourgeoisie of that tOAAm, stated that the new Esthonian Republic was not strong enough to withstand the Bolshevists Avithout the help of Allied forces.Mr. Clive has receiAred a manifesto from the representatives of the Esthonian Republic stating that, owing to German requisitions, the food supplies of the country are exhausted, and that the road is open to Bolshevism. It appeals to the British GoA^ernment (1) to supply Esthonia with arms, and to send Avarships to Reval; (2) to demand cessation of exports to Germany ; (3) to send supplies to Esthonia. Baron Schilling, formerly Secretary-General to M. Sazonov, who has just escaped from Russia, had an interview with Mr. Clive on November 18th. He stated that German prestige had suffered in Russia, and that the consequent ascendancy of British prestige could only be maintained, especially in the Baltic Provinces, by the appearance of a British Fleet.made up to the 11th, and decided by the 25th. The elections will take place on February 2nd. &quot;In case German-Austria wishes to be united with the German Republic, membership in the National Assembly shall be granted to its Deputies in accordance with the general regulation. A delay of election in Austria shall not take away its right of participation.&quot;On November 20th German-Austrians in Berlin met and favoured German-Austria joining the new German Republic. An official declaration Avas issued stating that the previous announcement (see November 19th above) about the dates of elections for the National Assembly Avas incorrect. The number of votes Avas estimated at 40.000,000, compared with 1-1,000,000 for the Reichstag. The German Consul-General and Vice-Consul in Zurich had been recalled. [On this day, see under &quot; Peace Discussions,&quot; appeared announcements that Cologne had established feeding stations along the roads for the retreating troops, and at other places large stations for furnishing food, and central stations for &quot; disorganised, badly clothed, and hungry soldiers &quot; in Mayence. The feeding of the passing troops in the Rhineland border toAAms fell on the municipal and provincial authorities. Press representatiAres in Cologne tell the newspapers of the Avhole world that unbearable distress has resulted to the population in the Rhinelands from the rapid AvithdraAval of the passing troops. Ebert is referred to as &quot;People&apos;s Commissary.&quot; An appeal is published from the Russian Soviet Government to German soldiers and sailors not to give up their arms ; comments are added. The German GoArernment decline an offer by the Russian Soviet Government to supply Germany continually with &quot; rich slocks of grain.&quot; The Soldiers&apos;Councils on the Eastern front take the same line. NeAvs from the German Eastern Provinces, especially Posen, is &quot; increasingly -threatening,&quot; Polish soldiers of the German Army saying openly that the Province must be taken by force, not as a gift. A Polish Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Council dominates Posen. In Berlin, police have been re-armed, and the Military Commander invites volunteers for a &quot; Republican Soldiers&apos; Guard.&quot; The Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Committee of the Navy form a &quot;Main Committee of the Navy &quot; from the Baltic Sea stations, and establish in Berlin a Central Naval Council of experienced pre-Avar Socialists. They insist that all orders of the State Ministry of Marine and of the Admiralty Stall shall be coimter-signed by a member of this Central Council.]
DENMARK.Bolshevism. The Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs told Ford Kilmarnock that he was in consultation with the Swedish and Norwegian Government in reference to taking common action against Bolshevist propaganda. Such action might consist in the withdrawal of their diplomatic representatives from Russia.   The Minister wenton to say that the Danish Banks were prepared to refuse to change rouble notes for the Bolshevists, though Swedish co-operation was necessary to render such a measure effective (vide &quot;Norway&quot;). On November 19th Lord Kilmarnock reported that the Danish Banks had decided to refuse to change roubles. He stated that the Socialists were entirely opposed to the Bolshevists. Mr. Anderson suggested to Lord Kilmarnock that a request from the British Government for the expulsion of Bolshevists would strengthen the hands of the Danish Government.The International Labour Conference. Lord Kilinarnock learns that Scandinavian Socialists are strongly in favour of the representation of British Labour at the Conference, but realise that this would be impossible if such men as Borgbjerg, who had shown pro-German sympathies, were chosen as the Danish delegates.The Schleswig Question. The Danish Press states that enthusiastic public meetings have been held at Aabenraa in North Sclileswig, at which a letter from Dr. Solf was read to the effect that the future of North Schleswig would depend on the self-determination of the population concerned. It was resolved that a request should be made to the Danish Government to take over North Schleswig if the plebiscite pronounced in favour of such a union. Lord Kilmarnock suggests that advantage might be taken of clause 25 of the Armistice to occupy Als Island and possibly Aaro Island. This, he- considers, would stimulate pro-English sentiment, and place Great Britain in a favourable position for deciding the frontier question.FINLAND.Internal Condition. Mr. Clive learns that the Finnish Government fears an immediate Bolshevist attack, but that it has not sufficient food at its disposal to meet the military needs of the Finnish army. On November 16th Mr. Barclay telegraphed that the War Trade Board of the United States was prepared to send 6,000 tons of flour to Finland if Scandinavian vessels could be supplied for its transport,MEXICO.German Espionage in Mexico. Mr. Barclay learns that the Government of the United States has asked the Swiss Minister to demand from the German Government the immediate recall of the German Minister from Mexico. This action is due to the increasingly .unfriendly attitude of Mexico towards the United States, and this is encouraged by German intrigue.NETHERLANDS.Internal Condition.  On November 13th Sir W. Townley reported that several arrests had been made and that soldiers had been placed in Government offices and buildings. He considered that the strong measures employed by the Government had a good effect. A Press Report, that the Entente Powers would stop food supplies in the event of disorder, has added to this. On November 14-th Sir W. Townley was able to report that the outlook was more favourable, though at Amsterdam au attack on the barracks had resulted in bloodshed. At The Hague the Queen drove through the streets and was heartily cheered. On November 18th Sir W. Townley reported a complete change in the situation.   Mr. Troelstra denied in tlie Chamber that he had
meditated a coup d&apos;etat and afterwards stated that he had over-estimated the power of his party.   A national demonstration has taken place in favour of the Queen.Supplies. Though the General Agreement for the importation of food into Holland has not been signed pending the approval of the Government of tlie United States, the Foreign Office has informed the Dutch Gioverninent through Mr. Colyn that, provided the restrictions as to exports to Germany arc continued, His Majesty&apos;s Government will facilitate the sailing of Dutch vessels to America for the purpose of bringing back supplies. His Majesty&apos;s Government is permitting the export of a quantity of coal to Holland.Passage of German Troops through Limburg. Sir VY. Townley reports that on November 13th the Minister for Foreign Affairs told the Representatives of five Allied Powers that, in order to preclude the necessity of defending the frontier by force at a time when the internal situation ivas critical, the Netherlands Government had been compelled to permit German troops to pass through Limburg. These troops had been disarmed on entering Dutch territory. Sir W. Townley has been requested by the Foreign Office to make a formal protest against the violation of Dutch neutrality.NORWAY.Elections. The number of seats obtained by the political parties as the final result of the General Election is as follows: Liberals, 52; Conservatives, 50; Socialists, 18 ; Labour, 3 ; Agrarian, 3.   The Socialists have lost one seat,Bolshevism. Mr. Ovey learns that, according to his suggestion (vide Report No. 94), the Norges Bank is prepared to prevent financial dealings with Bolshevists if Danish and Swedish bankers take the lead, or if the British Government formulates a request for such a course. No extraordinary rouble transactions have been observed which would indicate the transmission of funds from Russia to the Norwegian Bolshevists.Mr. Ovey reported on November JGth that the Chief of the Secret Police has complained of the lax attitude of the Norwegian Government with reference to the expulsion of foreign agitators. He did not, however, forsee the likelihood of disturbances unless the Bolshevists first obtained successes in Sweden or Denmark.Goal Imports from England. Commenting on the enquiries of an important coal merchant as to future imports of coal from England, Mr. Ovey suggests that, owing to the collapse of Germany, Norway will be dependent on England for her coal supply for some time to come. Thus a great opportunity is given to British coal exporters to supplant German coal in Scandinavia,SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLICS.The Armistice. Sir A. Young has received the congratulations of the Govern-ment; and people of San Salvador on the conclusion of a peace which means the triumph of Justice and Right. The British community in Uruguay testifies to the unswerving devotion of the Government and peopde to the cause of the Allies during the war. Great enthusiasm prevailed in the Republics of Chile and Ecuador, and large pro-Ally demonstrations took place. The President of the Argentine Republic has declared a public holiday &quot; in celebration of the conclusion of the war and the triumph of the Allied Nations.&quot;SPAIN.Bolshevism. Count. Romanones has asked Sir A. Hardinge to suggest measures for the expulsion of Russian and other Bolshevists from Barcelona, where they constitute a serious clanger.0817-36 &apos; D
Transfer of German Ships (vide Report No. 93).-The Spanish-Embassy has assured the State Department at Washington that there was a definite transfer of title in the case of the vessels taken over by the Spanish Government.SWEDEN.Internal Conditions. On November .1.5th the Social Democratic Conference at Stockholm discussed a programme containing, inter alia, the following points :  (1) reform of the franchise for the Upper Chamber and town and country councils ; (2) votes for women ; (3) adherence to the Entente and their scheme for a League of Nations ; (4) a j lister distribution of food. If a Bill embodying this programme cannot be passed in the Riksdag by ordinary means the Social Democratic Party intends to proclaim a social republic with Branting as President. Bolshevism is to be fought.Branting has signed a Proclamation to the workers of Sweden demanding similar measures and also an eight hours&apos; day and the suspension of all military training. Constitutional cpaestions such as the abolition of the Monarchy are to be reserved for the Riksdag elected on the new franchise. The Government has issued a Declaration promising to introduce a Bill for the establishment of a new franchise. Mr. Clive reported on November 14th that the general feeling of unrest was due partly to the Socialist movements in other countries and partly to the violence of the extreme Socialist Press. The Army is affected, and Mr. Branting is losing a certain amount of his influence. Mr. Wallenburg endorsed these views, though he considered that the alarm was exaggerated. lie estimated that there were some 20,000 Bolshevists in Stockholm out of a population of 400,000. It was essential, however, for the GoA^ernment to make concessions. The Governments of Great Britain and the United States might issue a Declaration to the effect that food supplies would be stopped in the event of BolsheAdst disorders. Mr. Asker, who has just returned from Moscow, in a conversation with Mr. Clive emphasised the importance of starting anti-Bolshevist propaganda in SAveden and completely isolating Russia.On November .18th the Minister for Foreign Affairs told Mr. Clive that the staffs of the Swedish Legation at Petrograd and the Consulate-General at Moscoav had been ordered to leave.The Matin draws attention to the fact that Lucius, Avho, as German Minister at Stockholm, was one of the worst agents of German Imperialism and avIio distributed funds to the Bolshevists, has been requested by the neAv German Ckwernment to retain his post.Trade with Germany. Mr. Gosling telegraphed from Gothenburg on NoArember 14th to the effect that Swedish firms in his consular district intended to supply Germany with overseas goods, Avhile the Swedish Trade Commissions were shoAving hostility to British trade interests. The Foreign Office has informed Mr. Clive that any infringement of the terms of the SAvedish Agreement will jeopardise the supply of commodities to Sweden.Mr. Branting&apos;s Visit to Holland (decide Report No. 94). His Majesty&apos;s&quot; GoA^ernment has granted Mr. Branting&apos;s recmest to proceed as far as England, Avhere he will be Aveicomed, but is doubtful as to the advisability of promoting the meeting of the Internationale. Mr. Branting may not, therefore, be able to continue his journey to Holland.THE VATICAN.Food Situation in Germany. Count de Salis reported on November 13th that the Cardinal Secretary of State had begged him on behalf of the Pope to forAvard to His Majesty&apos;s Government the Archbishop of Munich&apos;s appeal to the Allied Governments for food supplies for Germany.
peace discussions.(N.B. Countries are arranged in alphabetical order under this heading.)General. German. Wireless lias been daily flooding the world with messages, addressed to various authorities, to enlist sympathy with German women and children, who, it is alleged, cannot be fed if the rolling stock clause of the armistice is enforced, and if the army of occupation is to be fed from German resources. The plea is also used that there will be a shortage due to having to feed returning German armies from their own resources, [instead of from food taken from the population of invaded countries ?] The United States Government has requested the Germans to approach them through the proper diplomatic channels, and not by wireless.   The food shortage appears to be much exaggerated.His Majesty&apos;s Government on November I6th sent enquiries to Holland and Scandinavian countries about notifications sent there by the German Government in accordance with Clause 32 of the armistice, removing all German restrictions for trading of neutral merchant ships with the Associated Powers.Denmark. May intend to put forward demands on the Peace Settlement (Mr. Ovey, November 19th).France. On November IGth-lTth (received 18th-20th) Lord Derby reported that M. Barres stated to a meeting of the League of Patriots that the Alsace-Lorraine which France required was that of IS 1.4, with Landau, Sarre-Louis, and the mining valley of the Saare. The Matin, in a leading article, states that, whatever the United States may . do, the French are bound to claim damages for destruction committed by the Germans in France. The bill is estimated at 3-40 milliards of francs, and includes the amount of the French war indemnity of 1870 with interest for 47 years (60 milliards), French war expenses (140 milliards), pensions (40 milliards), reparation for damage (100 milliards). The Debuts publishes an article by Gauviii recommending the Allies to decide on the principal conditions to be presented to Germany before the expiration of the armistice, demanding their acceptance within a short period, with the resumption of hostilities as the alternative.Germany. Sir W. Townley, on November 11th, reported that he had not pressed for the strict internment of the ex-Kaiser. Military members of his suite had been interned and placed on parole.Lord Kilmarnock, on reliable authority, reports a good deal of food in Germany, provided that the army supplies are used (November 18th).German Wireless for the current week shows that the &quot; sympathy campaign,&quot; predicted two years ago, is now in full blast in connection with the alleged severity of the armistice terms. On November 12th lierr Solf made a special appeal to President Wilson to arrange for immediate conclusion of a &quot; preliminary peace,&quot; on account of a &quot; pressing danger of famine.&quot;On November 13th German Wireless is full of quotations from inspired articles in the German and neutral Press, condemning the armistice conditions, especially surrender of rolling stock In reply to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;, lierr Sche idem aim. tries to make out that the German nation did not support the war polity. The National Council of the Women in Germany appeal to Mrs. Woodrow Wilson against the armistice conditions affecting surrender of rolling stock, on the plea that Germany &quot; has to feed the troops of her former enemies in the occupied provinces &quot; ; and that German women and children will die from hunger by the million. A similar appeal is made to the &quot; National Council of Women of Great Britain and Ireland,&quot; and of France, and to the Marchioness of Aberdeen. Admiral von Hipper is referred to as &quot; Chief of the High Seas Forces and &quot;expert adviser&quot; to the &quot;Plenipotentiaries of the Workmen^ and Soldiers&apos; Council of the German Fleet.&quot;On November 15th another appeal is sent to Washington on similar lines, asking that a German Commission may go to Washington, and that plenipotentiaries of Germany and the United States may meet at The Hague. Mr. HooveFs aid is specially invited.   On the same date a similar appeal is made to the Pope, and, by tli&apos;e
&quot; Independent Social Democratic Party &quot; to the &quot; luteniational Workers and Party Comrades.&quot;   The signatories state that they opposed the Brest Treaty.On November 16th- Prince Lichno\vsky&apos;s appeal to the British nation for a modification of the armistice conditions is published. On the same date the British guarantee of the safety of the surrendered U-boats is announced. Soli: again appeals to President Wilson to &quot;save women and children from starvation &quot; by an immediate conference at The Hague.On November 17th Herr Scheidemann takes the same line.On November 18th an appeal is made for alleviating various imaginary conditions of the armistice affecting the economic resources of the llhinehmds, and another attempt is made to get out of the agreement to hand over rolling stock. The U-boat crews at Wilhelmshaven promise to go where they are sent.Subsecpicnt wireless reports show that the German armies retiring through the Rhinelands have been fed from the food resources of their own population, who at once appealed to the &quot; whole world &quot; to save them from starvation.Great Britain. The Ministry of Labour reported on November Gth-13th distinct symptoms of rapprochement between the proletariat, both in England and in France, and the proletariat in Germany. Most Labour papers criticise the absence of Labour representation at the preliminary negotiations.Montenegro. Hopes to be represented at the Conference to discuss peace preliminaries (Mr. Phipps, November 15th).Norway. Will probably ask to be represented at the Peace Conference (Mr. Ovey, November 10th).Russia. Russian Wireless of November 15th claims, on behalf of the &quot; All-Russian Executive Committee,&quot; that the Brest-Litovsk Treaty Avas annulled by German and Russian revolutionaries. [The fact is not stated that the Brest Treaty Avas annulled in the terms of armistice granted to Germany, and that armistice resulted from naval and military operations undertaken against. Germany and&quot; -her&apos; allies, who were deserted by Russia at a most critical period in the war. No mention is made of the endeavours made by the Bolshevist Government to preArent the success of the Allied arms by revolutionary propaganda in the countries which&apos; supplied the forces that forced Germany to sue for an armistice.]Spain. Sir A. Hardinge Avas informed on November 14th about the conditions of the German armistice involving the internment of surface Avar vessels. As affecting the question of internment in Spanish harbours, it Avas made clear to Sir A. &apos; Hardinge that these vessels, when interned, would have to be under the control of an Allied naA^al force, the commander of which force could be subjected to no restrictions in carrying out his delicate duties. According to a report from Sir A. Hardinge of November 18th, there appears to be no prospect of the Spanish GoA^ernment agreeing to internment in their waters.Su-eden. May put forward demands at the Peace Settlement (Mr. Ovey, November 19th).Turkey.-On November 15th, Herr Soil&apos; made a nauseous appeal by wireless to President Wilson against the expulsion of German civilians from Turkey under Article 19 of the Turkish armistice. Herr Solf asks that German civilians may be left in charge of hospitals and asjdums for-orphans on the plea that these orphans are chiefly Armenians. [Comment is needless.] Armenians in Egypt protest against the omission in the Turkish armistice terms of the evacuation by Turkish troops of Cilicia and the Armenian vilayets, and their occupation by Allied troops (Sir R. Win gate, November 18th).United States. In an important telegram dated November .13th Mr. Barclay reported the probability of use being made of the German &quot;Freedom of the Seas &quot; catclnvord to try and accentuate the difference between the British and American points of vieAV. [As far as can be judged from Press reports, an international agree-ment defining contraband of Avar would meet the American vieAv.   The question of
othe right oil search is not raised. This question was dealt with in Appendices to Western Reports Nos. 52, Part I., and 5C, Part I.] On the same day Mr. Barclay quoted Press reports that President Wilson would probably come to Europe for the Peace Conference, accompanied by Mr. Lansing, Mr. Root, and Justice Brandeis. The reports are not officially confirmed, and the inclusion of the two last mentioned is considered improbable on good authority (November loth). Whether the President comes would depend chiefly upon the time he would have to be away from the United States.   Latest Press reports state that lie has decided to come.The Secretary of State on November 13th addressed a Note to the Swiss Minister about the numerous appeals being made through German Wireless to President Wilson about the armistice terms with Germany and Turkey.   The Note ends as follows : &quot; Government of United States takes this opportunity to suggest to German Government that communications of this nature which pertain to terms of armistice or to matters in which all Associated Governments are interested should be sent to all Governments, and not addressed alone to President or Government of United States. Government of United States also desires to call attention of German Govern-meiit. to fact that those communications should be presented through established diplomatic channels rather than by direct radio communication.&quot;
