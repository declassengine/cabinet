SECRET.APPIiEOl ATION  OF  the ATTACHKD  \VE8TEItiN   AND GENERALREPORT  No. 121.General.The balance of opinion supports the view that the German Delegates will sign the Peace Terms. Private reports to the contrary have been received from Switzerland.   Credentials have been exchanged with the Austrian Peace Delegation.Allied Countries.China (page 2). The Shanghai Conference between North and South has definitely broken down.France (page 2). Details given about French Socialism are of interest; the notable point mentioned is [that 80 per cent, of the soldiers are peasants, not the class to which Bolshevik theories and methods appeal.Lord Derbj&apos;s report of French policy towards Italy deserves special attention.Italy (page 3). Signor Salanclra and Marchese Salvage Raggi have resigned from the Peace Delegation ; a list of the present Delegates is given.Enemy Countries.Austria-Hungary (page 4). Details are given of the establishment of the counter-revolutionary Government in Hungary. The Hungarians have gained military successes against the Czechs.In German-Austria the movement towards union with Germany seems to be weakening.   The relative economic Peace Terms will doubtless affect this cmestion.Reports&apos; of negotiations between Czecho-Slovakia and the Hungarian Soviet Government are discredited.Germany (page 5). It is interesting to note that the violent excitement of the Press about the Peace Terms is not reflected in the attitude of the people of Berlin.Financial difficulties are arising over the purchase of imported food-stuffs.The Workmens&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Councils of Gireater Berlin have approved of the signature of the Peace Terms, but herr llaase&apos;s attitude, as representing the Independent Socialists, deserves attention.Soldiers&apos; Councils are being reduced with the demobilisation of the Army.Neutral Countries.Baltic Provinces (page 8). The outstanding features of this week&apos;s news are the increase in strength of the German troops at Libau, successes by the Esthonians and Russians against the Bolsheviks, and the fall of Riga.Finland (page 8). The Government has taken care to explain that the operations of volunteers against the Bolsheviks are not designed to jump Finnish claims to part of Karelia. [p.t.o.
Norway (page 9) is likely to join the League of Nations.Spain. There are indications that German influence over the Spanish Press is weakening. The Peace Terms are not considered to be excessive or vindicative excepting in a few papers notoriously under German control.Peace Discussions (page 10).The diary of procedure in Paris is continued from former Reports. Points of immediate interest are the attitude of Poland to the Ukraine and the Admiralty Memorandum on the League of Nations Covenant.G. G. A.May 29th, 1919.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Relaxation of Trade Restrictions. The Blockade Council has passed the following resolution : &quot; The several Associated Governments shall be requested to instruct their representatives in Christiania to deliver on May 28th an identical note to the Norwegian Foreign Office, stating that the guarantee against re-exportation to Germany offered by Norway is. accepted by the Associated Governments, and that in consideration of this guarantee, all restrictions and regulations heretofore imposed by the Associated Governments on exports to Norway will be suspended forthwith, subject only to the right of any Associated Government to adopt such regulation of exports as is considered advisable.&quot;ALLIED  GROUP.CHINA.North and South. The negotiations between the North and South at the Shanghai Conference appear to have broken down with the resignation of the delegates.of both parties. The Northern delegat.es were prepared to agree to most of the demands of the South, which included i&apos;l) the establishment of a legal parliament for the whole of, China, (2) the recognition, of Hsu Shih Chang as provisionall President, (3) refusal to recognise the Shantung settlement, (4) cancellation of all secret treaties, (5) the disbandment of the National Defence Army, and ((5) the removal of high officials whose administration has been contrary to the wishes of the people. Negotiations broke down on the question of the cancellation of the presidential mandate of June 13th, 1917, dissolving Parliament. Sir J. Jordan is of opinion that the decision of the Paris Conference to hand over German rights in China to Japan is responsible for a general feeling of despair on both- sides. Japanese goods are already boycotted in Shanghai, and an outburst of anti-foreign feeling would- not come as a surprise (Sir, J. Jordan, May 17th).CUBA.Strike. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Havana reports that a serious situation has arisen owing to a strike at the Electric Power Station.FRANCE.Socialism. Attention is directed to a Memorandum (G.T. 7317) issued by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office on Socialism in France.The meeting of the Socialist Federation of the Seine, which preceded the Socialist Party Congress, is first dealt with. The extremists, indignant at the recent acquittal of Villain, showed great voting strength but they failed to defeat Longuet, the leader of the new majority, himself a semi-Bolshevist, who secured 17 delegates to the Congress as against 12 secured by Loriot, the Bolshevist leader, and six by the old majority with the Centre.At the Congress Longuet, whose policy is to maintain his position between the Left and the Right, was able to carry through a programme acceptable to Thomas in face of the Opposition of the Extremists, who were easily defeated. The power of the latter, however, is to be seen in the programme which defeated them. It includes the abolition of the Senate, universal suffrage for both sexes, the conscription of capital, the giving a share to the State in all businesses sufficiently concentrated to allow of it, a Constituent Assembly for the reform, of the Constitution and a referendum
giving the initiative to the public ; and finally alludes to the dictatorship of the proletariat and condemns the war as the result of capitalism. Two other divisions of opinion were prominent. There was cleavage on the questions of responsibility for the war and participation in the International. Longuet&apos;s motion, for adherence to-the Second International was carried (vide Report No. 110, page 3).The avowed Bolshevists were in. each case very badly defeated, and the Debats considers that the approximation between Longuet and the Right which led to their defeat proved &quot; the relatively moderate tendencies of the Congress and its preference of evolution to revolution.&quot; The movement of such a man as Mayeras from the Extreme Left, the defeat of the Bolshevists without the aid of.the Forty Deputies of the Extreme Right, who did not attend the Congress, and; the respectful&apos; treatment accorded to Thomas have a similar significance.But the writei&apos; of the Memorandum states that the most important point is the relation between the Socialist Party and&apos; the General Federation of Trades Unions. The former only numbers 57,000, and its voting power, as shown by the last election, is-only a million and a half. The General Federation declared recently that it was a professional not a political organisation. The question is whether the workmen, peasants and soldiers, of whom 801 per cent, are peasants- will support a semi-Bolshevist Socialist party.The writer comes to the following- conclusion: On the whole, if a prophecy must be-made and&apos;it is made with great diffidence the probability seems to be that the Socialist Party will move more to the Left, but return fewer Deputies, and very possibly split up into quarrelling sections. The &quot; Forty &quot; Deputies can hardly retain their places in a semi-Bolshevist party, though; they still remain more or less under the- party discipline, as maybe seen by Compere MorePs resignation after May 1st of the minor office he still held. They are often said to have no following in the rank and file of the party, and&apos; though they assert the contrary even in private, this is probably true. But a more important question is what following have they outside the party ? It seems likely that many of the same sort of people voted for them who voted for the Majority Socialists in Germany. Most of such people will-probably shrink from a semi-Bolshevist Socialism, and will either vote no more for Socialists or will vote for-such Socialists as Longuet and his friends will find an embarrassment rather than a support. Thomas always remains on the fence, and Renaudel has for two years been crying unity when unity in fact there was none. They will have ultimately either to oppose Longuet or to sink into insignificance as his followers. Their weakness of political character and their fondness for the abstract theories of their party makes it quite likely that they will do the latter. But if so they will simply have been swallowed- up and will disappear. And a party which crushes or sheds- all: the men who, like Branting; Vandervelde, and Thomas, and even Varenne- and Compere Morel, have had some actual experience of great affairs will, to say the least; run; the risk of becoming a mere quarrelsome and-verbose debating society of rhetoricians.Italian Relations. Lord Derby reports that officially no effort is being, spared&apos; in France to conciliate Italian opinion and to emphasise the solidarity of the Latin races by means of public declarations by the President and other prominent men. To celebrate the fourth anniversary of&apos; Italy/s entry into the war,.a resolution supported by the Government is being brought forward by-a number of Deputies in honour of Franco-Italian fri en clship.There, lias appeared a tendency in the French Press to accuse Italian newspapers-of publishing., misleading statements and of misinterpreting the views of their own Government. Socialist papers especially champion Jugo-Slavia and condemn Im-perialism, but Mi Herve in the Victoire deplores their anti-French sentiments and urges the importance of a Latin Union.to counter-balance the great American, British and Slav &quot;blocs.&quot;ITALY.The Peace Delegation. Signor Salandra and Marchese Salvago Raggi have resigned their posts as Italian delegates to the Peace Conference. On May 20th ten members of the Ministry left Rome to meet Signor Orlando on the frontier. An. official communication subsequently announced that at this meeting, which took place at Oulx, the President of the Council reported on the work of the Italian delegates  in Paris which had  been in conformity with the declarations of the
Gpvemmeut as approved by Parliament, lie explained tlie great diHiculties wbicdi the realisation of the programme encountered in view of the complex problems and manifold international interests. These difficulties they had done their best to overcome and they required the disciplined co-operation of the country to support them.The Italian delegation now consists of Signor Orlando, baron Sonnino, Signor Orespi, the Machese lmperiali, and Signor Barzilai (Sir R. Rodd, May 21st to 24th).UNITED STATES.The Peace Terms. Gerniany&apos;s attitude at the Peace Conference has received but little support from the Press. Her Government is regarded as bluffing the Allies and the terms are considered as a just retribution for her crimes. Armed intervention is favoured in the event of it being necessary to compel the German Government to accept the terms.The Assembly of Congress on May 19th has opened the way to a freer discussion of the Treaty. The Republican Party, through its Press aiid in the Senate, has expressed its determination to separate the League of Nations from the Treaty in order to qualify the former, and to this end has appointed a majority of anti-League Senators to the Foreign Relations Committee. The Democrats argue that dissection would mean the rejection of the whole Treaty. It is doubtful whether the Republicans will actually run the risk of delaying its passage (Mr. Barclay, May 27th).The Eastern Question. The proposed American mandate over Turkey and Armenia is not favourably received. The majority of the Press see only entangle-ments and obligations in it, and Pan-American sentiment is frankly hostile. EnglancFs proposal to keep the Sultan in Constantinople out of deference to Mohammedan feelings is unpopular, and is even regarded by Extremists as a continuation of her immemorial policy of bolstering up the &quot; sick man of Europe &quot; (Mr. Barclay, May 27th).ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNG AR YHungary. According to a wireless message from Budapest (May 25th) the counter-revolutionary &quot; bourgeois &quot; Government in Szeged under the protection of the French troops of occupation has founded an anti-Bolshevist committee and has set up a White Guard and a court-martial. The latter condemned to death or imprisonment several workers&apos; leaders who had been taken prisoner with the assistance of the French.The following details are given in the Soviet Oiovernmcnt of the composition of the counter-revolutionary Government.The President is Count Julius Karolyi, son of the notorious Count Tivor Karolyi, ex-President of the House of &quot; Magnates,&quot; who died in a lunatic asylum. Julius Karolyi, who already shows symptoms of paralysis, possessed up to the time of the proclamation of the Soviet Republic large estates in the county of Arad, of which at the time of the Wekerle Coalition Government he was appointed Lord Lieutenant,A second &quot; pillar &quot; of the counter-revolution is the ex-Deputy Bela Barabas, who -up to the 31st October 1918, the day of the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution, was Lord Lieutenant in Arad under the Wekerle Government. Ludwig Palmay, the Minister for Justice, was Tisza&apos;s most faithful henchman, and the sworn enemy of Barabas until the proclamation of the Soviet Republic, but apparently they have now been reconciled.Ludwig Yarjassy, who has taken .over the portfolio of Minister of Commerce, was Government Commissary in the Karolyi Government and a bank director.Johann Hintzig is Tisza&apos;s most notorious Lord Lieutenant whose rule denoted the suppression of every political movement on the part of the workers.Baron Ludwig Solyiuossy, the Finance Minister, is a large landowner, who amassed over 40 millions with the sweat of the working people, but was driven out of his estates at the outbreak of the first revolution.
Mr. Gosling (Prague) learns that agents of the Arad Government are attempting to gain Czech support against the Hungarian Bolshevists. Numerous protests have appeared in the wireless reports from Budapest against any proposals for the union of West Hungary with German Austria.The Hungarians appear to have achieved considerable success in their military operations. In the north they have captured Miskolcz and Fulek from the Czechs, while in the east the Rumanians have been unable to cross the Theiss.German-Austria. According to a telegram received from Lord Acton (Berne), Professor Lammasch considers the choice of Rentier as head of the Austrian Delegation to the Peace Congress to be a good one; the latter was not particularly intelligent, but he was better able than any of the other Socialist politicians to persuade his party to relinquish the idea of union with Germany. Both the other two plenipotentiaries, Herr Schonbauer and Professor Gurtler, are regarded by Professor Lanunascb. as opposed to the union. Professor Lammasch called attention to the fact that the Delegation comprised a representative of each of the three important Austrian parties, viz., the Socialists, the Christian Socialists and the German Nationalists ; after all the agitation which had been made in favour of the union with Germany no one party could have taken the initiative in dropping that policy but the present triumvirate, representing as it did all the various par-ties in the National Assembly, would be able to carry through the abandonment of a policy, to the failure of which even Bauer is now reconciled.Czecho-Slooak la. Mr. Gosling does not believe that there is any truth in the statement (referred to in Report No. 120, page 4) that the Czech Government is entering into negotiations with Hungarian Soviet Government, and thinks that the report has been circulated by Bolshevist agents in order to prejudice the Czech Government.Demonstrations, resulting in looting, have been made in Prague against Jewish shopkeepers. The Government shows weakness in dealing with the situation (Mr. Gosling, May 23rd).GERMANY.Conditions in Berlin. In his report referred to below Mr. Guillebaud gives an account of the general conditions prevailing in Berlin. The most remarkable feature is the general depression and listlessness of the people who wander aimlessly about, the streets apparently content to do nothing. The excitement and violent language of the Press with regard to the Peace terms was nowhere reflected among the people. The impression was gained that Germany would sign the Peace terms for the following reasons: (1) the Government, the wealthy, and the bourgeois classes are exceedingly afraid of the outbreak of internal anarchy and Bolshevism, (2) the blockade would be reimposed, (3) there is a strong desire to get back German prisoners, (A) the national pride of the Germans is broken and they would accept almost any humiliation if they could secure peace and the reopening of communication with the rest of the world. There are divergent views on the stability of the Government, but the bulk of the old Government officials are carrying on the routine administration with success, and the writer concludes that if peace is signed, and the present Government can maintain itself until the food situation improves, there is a reasonable hope that internal anarchy may be avoided.Food Situation. Mr. C. W. Guillebaud has drawn up a report on a visit to Berlin between May 2nd and May Sth (W.C.P. 845), made for the- purpose of obtaining wider publication of details connected with the delivery of foodstuffs by the Allies. Considerable space is devoted to a description of his efforts in this direction. The public men whom he interviewed were practically unanimous in raising the question of the difficulty in financing the purchase of foodstuffs.Herr Biittner, the chief permanent official in the Food Ministry, said : &quot; We cannot pay for the food, and we must have food before payment is made.&quot; He explained that the German worker was too under-nourished to do a proper day&apos;s work. On the other hand, Plerr Theodore Wolff stated that apart from the great cities and -industrial districts the position was not intolerable. Mr. Guillebaud draws the following conclusions. The bulk of the middle and upper classes looked in quite normal health, and their faces did not appear sunken or pinched. The poor certainly * showed the influence of privation to a greater- extent, but although lack of food and799-1- oh B
the depressing influence or defeat have taken the desire and the capacity to work hard from the majority of the people, the bulk of the adults are, in appearance at least, a long way from actual starvation. The food of tbe poor is monotonous and unpalatable to a high degree, but it is at least sufficient to maintain life for the normal healthy adidt who is neither old nor constitutionally liable to disease. On the other hand, consumption and many other diseases have increased enormously during the last three years, and the mortality among the young and the old is far above the pre-war rate. The shortage of milk is mainly responsible for the very high mortality among children.Prussia. In Konigsberg a strike movement of considerable extent lias broken out which is affecting all important branches of activity. Officials, higher employees, doctors, chemists, banks, &amp;c, have stopped work. -The Prussian Government have proclaimed a state of siege throughout West Prussia and no public meeting can be held without a preliminary -IS hours&apos; notice to the authorities (Nauen, May 21st).Upper Silesia and Poland. According to a German Wireless Report (May 23rd), the State Commissary for the district of Oppeln has sent to Scheidemann a telegram signed by a million and a half inhabitants of Upper Silesia, recpiesting that the following protest may be made to the Entente Governments : Upper Silesia, which many hundred years ago belonged for a short time to Poland, jnotests energetically against incorporation in that State. The Upper Silesian labouring and official classes know that in Poland they would immediately lose all the advantages, including the eight-hour day, conferred upon them by the exemplarv social political regime which they possess as Germans. They know too that the disabled, widows and orphans would immediately lose all State support, and would be handed over to misery and ultimate destruction. They also know that from a state based on the loftiest democratic principles they would pass to a capitalistic class state, in which oppression already reigns.The Peace Terms.- -Lord Acton has received information from various sources to the effect that Germany will not sign the peace terms. Both political leaders and professional men are stated to be against such a course. In view of an early harvest the German delegates will seek to gain time by repeated applications for a prolongation of the period in which to sign. It is further asserted that hopes are entertained that military action by the Allies will arouse such opposition in labour circles in the Entente countries as to make a resumption of hostilities impossible. The replacement of Scheidemann by Haase is said to be favoured by the Government. Our informant states that, if the terms are refused, a political, and, in any case, an economic treaty with Russia is contemplated.The first plenary meeting of the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils of Greater Berlin since the terms of the Peace Treaty became known, Avas held yesterday. After a debate, which at times was Arery heated, the proposal of the Independent Socialists that peace should be signed was adopted.In reality the Independents, says the message, are in the sharpest opposition to the conclusion of a genuine peace that can be kept. In contradiction to Scheide-rnann&apos;s speech, Haase stated at the demonstration of the Independent Socialists that he only wished for the signature of the Peace Treaty by the present Government, in order subsequently to treat the document as a scrap of paper.In an interview with the Morgenposb (May 17th), Herr Leinert, the President of the Prussian National Assembly, dealing with the Labour clauses in the Treaty, declared : &quot; With a good conscience we can leave it to the judgment of the working classes of the world to decide Avhether they will accept Clemenceau&apos;s hypocritical opinion that this simulacrum of a Labour Code, full of clauses and back doors and trap-stairs, is better than the German draft, which aims solely at the realisation of the actual and justifiable wishes of the worlds workers, as expressed by their own elected representatives in Berne.&quot;The Berliner Tageblatt (May 15th), protesting against the peace terms, states that the two proA&apos;inces of Posen and West Prussia supply Germany with 7&quot;3 per cent, of her wheat, I6&apos;5 per cent, of her rye, 13*3 per cent, of her barley, 7*7 per cent, of her oats, 1516 percent, of her potatoes, 19 per cent, of her sugar beet, 20&quot;2 per cent, of her pulse, 9*3 per cent, of her summer straw, 13*7 per cent, of her winter straw, and 7*1 per cent, of her hay.
East Prussia provides 5&apos;69 per cent, of the bread grain produced in Germany. In addition, Upper Silesia and Alsace-Lorraine, and possibly Schleswig, will have to be handed over with their surplus food supplies. The total loss, according to the estimate of the German Agricultural Council, will amount to not less than -]- of the German total production of bread grain and potatoes, whilst the loss of population will be but 10 per cent, of the whole population. Posen and West Prussia own 12 6 per cent, of the total stocks of German horses, 8 per cent, of the milch cows, G&quot;6 per cent, of the calves under three months, 9&apos;3 per cent, of the pigs, 11*7 per cent, of the sheep, and ST per cent, of the poultry. East Prussia and Schleswig also produce surplus meat and milk. Posen and West Prussia can supply 5&apos;4 million persons with a daily meat and milk ration of 2,550 calories, which woidd correspond to a pre-war consumption, whilst the population of the two provinces amounts to only 4&apos;06 millioirs. For the 1&apos;4 million people which remain foodstuffs (bread grain, potatoes, sugar, butter and milk) must be bought in foreign countries.Abolition of Soldiers&apos; CounciZs.-The following orders have been issued in connection with the disbandment of the peace army : &quot; With every disbandment staff and every liquidating depot of the units to be disbanded, one representative is to remain, to be elected by the remaining N.C.O.&apos;s and men. The S.C.&apos;s of units and other formations must be disbanded simultaneously, at latest when the total strength of N.C.O.&apos;s and men is less than 300.&quot; In accordance with the reduced number of troops, the strength of the S.C.&apos;s belonging to the General Commands will be fixed at three members.&quot; In garrison towns, in which the total of the different formations, &amp;c, of the former peace army numbers more than 1,500 N.C.O.&apos;s and men, the garrison S.C.&apos;s will remain in existence, their number, not exceeding three members, to be fixed by the General Commands. The sphere of operations of the garrison S.C.&apos;s does not extend to the Reichswehr formations of the garrisons.&quot;The Leipzig Fair. The following notes are extracted from a Report on the Leipzig Fair (M.I. 9E, 15607) :-&quot;Among the 8,200 exhibitors, a number which marks a large advance on any previous figure, were many agents as well as actual manufacturers. The same articles might thus be seen four or five times over, the agents in many cases offering them at cheaper prices than the original manufacturers.&quot; The war has not led to standardised types. There were at least 30 different models of water-taps, &amp;c. In many cases, however, the stocks were small. Time of delivery varied, but was not as a rule excessive in comparison with pre-war conditions.&quot; Prices are going up and goods are offered at the price that may obtain at the date of delivery, with numerous reservations in case of strikes, civil war, and transport and other difficulties.&quot; Very little copper is to be seen in either the engineering or building depart-ments. There is very little tin.or tin-plate; the former is replaced by lead in alloys, solders, &amp;c, the latter by varnished sheet-iron. There is no more good enamel. There is a great deal of very expensive synthetic rubber, which serves as a substitute for real rubber in numerous cases (e.g., insulating joints) &quot;History of the Soviet Movement in Munich. Attention is directed to an interesting Memorandum (G.T. 7322) issued by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office on the Soviet Governments in Munich and their suppression.The movement appears likely to have the following results : (1) It will strengthen the cause of law and order throughout Germany, and discredit Bolshevism and Spartacism with the masses. (2) The unity of the- new German Empire will be con-siderably promoted. (3) The Berlin Government will probably insist upon the abolition of all separate Bavarian military organisation, and upon the unreserved incorporation of the Bavarian units in the Imperial Militia.
sNEUTRAL GROUP.BALTIC PROVINCES.Situation at Libau. Mr. Grant Watson reports that General von der Goltz lias returned to Libau. The German troops have been increased by the arrival of reinforcements amounting to 3,300 men. They have taken over control of the harbour, which they are reported to be putting into a state of defence. Training of troops is being carried out energetically.Sir C. Marling (Copenhagen) has received information to the effect that it is the intention of the German Government to send 2,000 Tartar prisoners of war to reinforce Prince Lieven&apos;s Corps. Fear is expressed that they will be used to terrorise the Lettish peasantry. General Gough, who has interviewed Mr. IThnanis, recom-mends that the Germans should be compelled to permit a Lettish Government to take over the administration of the country and to organise the national forces, and that they should be ordered to withdraw their troops from Latvia by a certain date. He considers the present position of the Allied representatives at Libau derogatory to the prestige of the Allies (Mr. Grant Watson, May 23rd).On May 24th German soldiers arrested five British naval officers, in spite of the fact that they carried passes, on the pretext that they crossed the ground near an old ammunition dump in the harbour. They were subjected to insulting remarks by German officers and only released after two and a half hours&apos; detention. The only explanation of this incident offered by the German Governor is that the soldiers thought they were dealing with persons disguised as naval officers and that the latter bribed the sentry to allow them to take away German fuses and cartridges (Mr. Grant Watson, May 20th).Military Situation. (1) General. The Russian forces in Esthonia are reported to be short of food, clothing and arms. It is suggested that the Esthonian Govern-ment should hand over to them a portion of the arms and equipment supplied by the British Government (Foreign Office, May 22nd).(2) Advance on Petrograd. A telegram from Reval (May 23rd) announces the capture of Kikerino by the Russian Northern Corps. The Chief of the Staff reports that only small Bolshevik forces at present oppose the Russian and Esthonian advance, but that serious resistance is expected on the Peterhof-Gratchina line. Considerable numbers of the Red Russian Army are reported to have deserted to the Russian forces (Mr. Clive, May 24th). Provisions are urgently required both for the Army and for the poprdation of Petrograd in the event of its capture (Mr. Bosanquet, May 21st).(3) Estlionian Front.--According to the Esthonian military report of May 24th the Esthonians have broken through the enemy positions along the whole of the Pskov front, and have reached Izborsk.In the Volmar and Marienburg regions the Bolsheviks have retreated (Moscow, May 25th).(4) Lettish Front. Mr. Grant Watson reports that Riga fell on May 22nd before a force composed of Germans, Baits and Letts. Lettish forces have reached the River Aa.FINLAND.Karelia. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Helsingfors has been informed that a com-: munication to the following effect has been presented to the French Government:   &quot; The sole object of the presence in Olonetz of Finnish volunteers is to support the populace in their struggle against Bolshevism. The Finnish Government has no wish to create a fait accompli in the Karelian question without the consent of Great Powers.&quot;MEXICO.Revolutionist Activity. Activity is reported in the States of Chihuahua, Duraugo, Tamaulipas, Vera Cruz, Mexico, and Oaxaca, Rio Blanco in Vera Cruz and Cananca in Sonora&apos; have been occupied by the Revolutionists. An account is given in the Mexican Press of a great meeting held by revolutionary armed forces on the
borders of Tamavdipas and San Luis Potosi, at which it was decided to support Robles Dominguez as the provisional President.The Press is endeavouring to prove that the Americans are financing the revolution against Carranza.The appointment of Calles as Minister of Industry has made a bad impression owing to his brutal and corrupt methods as Governor of the State of Sonora (Mr. Cummins, May 21st, 22nd and 26th).NORWAY.The League of Nations. There are indications that the Norwegian Government is in favour of eventually entering the League of Nations (Sir M. Findlay, May 23rd).SPAIN.il/o?&apos;occo. The Spanish Government takes exception to the wording.of the clause in the Peace Treaty abolishing German rights &quot; in the Shereefian Empire &quot; as implying a power vested in France to interfere with Spanish control of foreign relations within the Spanish zone. The&apos; standpoint is taken that either it should he clearly stated that the Spanish zone is not included in the Shereefian Empire or Spain must, under the conditions of the Treaty of 1912, have a decisive or equal voice in its relations with the outer world (Sir A. Hardinge, May 24th).Poland. Sir A. Hardinge reported on May 23rd that Spain has recognised the independence of Poland.The Spanish Press and the Peace Terms. The bulk of the Spanish Press finds the peace terms severe but not excessive or vindictive. The Diario Universal (May 15th) criticises Germany&apos;s conduct of the war and does not blame the Allies for requiring guarantees. The JSpoca enquires whether the Allies have not good cause to show themselves exacting and suspicious. The Pais considers the terms severe but not unjust. In the event of victory the German terms would have been much harsher. The Publicidad declares that those who talk of reconciliation overlook the fact that the feelings of the Germans have not changed. It would be suicidal for the Entente to neglect to disarm Germany.The pro-German newspapers are strong in their abuse. The Imparciud (May 9th) says : &quot; The struggle was to the death ; the peace corresponds to the struggle. If Germany had won, her sword would have put an end to her adversary ; she fell, and her enemy deals the coup de grace. The peace is savage, arrogant and implacable. Is it the prologue to other wars : the Jena precursor of another Sedan ? &quot; The Tribuna declares that the Treaty masks, more or less skilfully and in diplomatic forms, schemes of annexation and spoliation which are in conflict with Wilson&apos;s principles and with right and justice. The Dia goes to the furthest lengths : &quot; Germany&apos;s action said tacitly but clearly &apos; we surrender in &quot;the moment of victory not to Foch&apos;s strategy but to President Wilson&apos;s principles.&apos; And in order to satisfy these principles Germany carried out her revolution. But Germany ouce disarmed, the Allied diplomacy deliberately pursued its work of extermination.&quot;SWITZERLAND.Reimposilion of the Blockade.-According to the Gazette de Lausanne the Federal Council has been considering the note of the Allied and Associated Powers enquiring whether in given circumstances the Swiss Government would be prepared to enforce a stricter blockade against Germany (vide Rej)ort No. 120, page 2).
