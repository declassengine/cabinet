WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Relaxation of Trade Restrictions. The Blockade Council has resolved that Inter-Allied Trade Committee permits may now be dispensed with in respect of all classes of German exports other than those on prohibited and statutory lists, and that the Allied Blockade Committee be informed and recptested to notify Inter-Allied Trade Committees to this effect (Mr. Balfour, April 30th).Food Supplies. The Supreme Economic Council has passed the following-resolution : &quot; The import of foodstuffs into Northern Neutrals and Switzerland may for the present be permitted freely, subject only to such regulations as may be prescribed by the exporting country, and provided that the importing country will maintain the existing guarantees against re-exportation to Hungary and Bolshevik Russia &quot; (Astoria, May 5th).The Blockade Council has decided that quantitive restrictions upon the export to enemy countries of herrings and fish from Holland are to be removed (Mr. Balfour, April 30th).War Graves Commission. The Secretary of State for War has issued a memorandum-randum (G.T. 7192) on the work of the Imperial War Graves Commission in France and Belgium.ALLIED  GROUP.CHINA.Russian Relations. The Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office has issued a Memorandum (G.T. 7161) on the principal events in the relations between Russia and China.FRANCE.Politiccd Situation. Attention is directed to a Memorandum (G.T. 7183) drawn up by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office on the Political Situation in France. The writer thinks that M. Cleinenceau&apos;s position is not so strong to-day as at the time of the Armistice for the following reasons : (1) His duties at the Peace Conference have prevented him from giving his full attention to the Chamber and to domestic affairs. (2) Public opinion is disappointed that France does not dominate the Conference. (3) Members of the Cabinet possess only mediocre-ability. The financial speeches of M. Klotz, for instance, have had&quot; a very bad reception in the Chamber. At present M. Briand is thought to be the only man who could possibly fill M. Clemenceau&apos;s place, and he has given his support to such parliamentary reforms as the &quot; scrutin d&apos;arrondissement &quot; and proportional repre-sentation, which figure largely in domestic politics, and to which a big majority of the present Chamber is pledged.However, the victory of the extreme Socialist party in the next elections need not necessarily be anticipated for several reasons:-(J) France has probably a greater sense of unity and a stronger consciousness of national life than any country in the world, and this feeling must act against the left wing of the Socialist party, whose attitude has been unpatriotic both before and during the war. (2) The industrial districts, which are the seed-bed for Socialism, have suffered most from Germany, and are not likely to heed the German internationalism of Marx. (3) The peasants are above all things property owners. (4) The Army will probably resent the complete silence of the Socialist Press about Marshal Foch. (5) There is evidence that the Socialist party has not greatly increased its strength, while there is a cleavage between the extreme and moderate Socialists, and even between the extremists themselves. M. Longuet, for instance, was unable to speak at a meeting of the Federation of the Seine, and declared his opponents to be &quot; une poignee d&apos;anarchistes.&quot;
Manifesto of the Confederation Generate du Travail. IlmnanitS (April 12th) publishes a mauifesto of the C.G.T. on the peace terms, headed &quot;To Public Opinion : to the Workers.&quot;From August 1914 to November 1918 we have repeatedly been told that we are carrying on a war of Right. This assurance implied that the peace would confer on peoples the freedom of self-determination, and that this would be founded on general disarmament, the sole measure which can make possible the liquidation of the war debts.To-day the promises solemnly given have been broken. &apos;   Our diplomats offer us a scheme for a League of Nations which is not the Society of Nations of President Wilson&apos;s 14 points.The French working class, faithful to its conception of &quot; the war to end war,&quot; protests against the sabotage of the peace.On emerging from their torture, the peoples must not be condemned to have no other aim in view than the payment of taxes in order that armament budgets may be balanced.The O.G-.T. also condemns any external policy of blockade, of compulsion, of political or armed intervention.It recalls the formula of the French ReA-olntion :Each nation has alone the right to make its own laws, the inalienable right to change them; to attempt to take this right by force from a foreign nation is to become the enemy of the human race.The G.G.T. protests vigorously against the expedition to Russia, an allied country against which a formal declaration of war has never been made.Labour Day. Rejjorts of the occurrences on Labour Day have appeared in the Press. According to a Trades Union poster the objects of the strike were to demand the eight hours&apos; day, an amnesty for all prisoners, speeding up of demobilisation, a just peace, disarmament, and to protest against intervention in Russia, taxes on wages, martial law and the ceusorship (Lord Derby, April 30th).Lord Derby reports that Socialist agitation against the repressive measures taken by the Police to deal with the demonstrations continues.M. Jouhaux, the Secretary General of the Confederation Generale du Travail, has resigned his position as technical delegate to the Peace Conference on the ground that, having been appointed to represent the French labour classes, it is impossible for him to. continue his collaboration after the action of the Government in brutally preventing French working-men from expressing their desires and manifesting their -aspirations.Two other Socialists, M; Buisson and M. Compere-Morel, who held posts in the Ministries of Merchant Marine and Agriculture respectively, have resigned.Manifestoes have been issued by various leading Socialist and Labour organisa-tions protesting against the action of the Government and the &quot;organised massacre &quot; of peaceful demonstrators, and asserting the intention of continuing the action which has been begun aud of preparing for a demonstration &quot; still more imposing than that of May 1st.&quot;Treaty with Monaco. A Treaty has been signed by the plenipotentiaries of the French Republic and the Principality of Monaco &quot;confirming by a formal act of mutual confidence the protective, friendship which . . . the Principality has always encountered at the hands of the French Government &quot; (W.C.P. 705).Presidents Message to Italy. The Press (April 30th) publishes the following-message addressed by the President of the Republic to Italy through the agency of the Franco-Italic organ of the Franco-Italian Association : &quot; Italy and France, closely united in -war, will remain united in peace. Nothing will separate them. Any diminution of their friendship would be a catastrophe for Latin civilisation and humanity. France, faithful to her engagements, her sympathies and her traditions, will go hand in-hand with Italy &quot; (Lord Derby, April 30th).ITALY.The Peace Deadloch.-Slv R. Rodd states that though public opinion is calmer it is even more determined on the retention of Fiume.  Since the publication of President Wilson&apos;s message national honour is felt to be at stake.
A vast meeting was held at the tomb of Augustus under the auspices of D&apos;Annunzio who made an inflammatory speech. The right of the Allied Governments to present the preliminary peace terms to the German delegates in the abseuce of the Italian delegates was challenged and the annexation of the territories included in the Pact of London demanded (Sir R. Podd, May 5th).An unfortunate impression is likely to be created by the reproduction in the Italian Press of a letter written from Switzerland by Professor Herron alleging that compromise bas proved ineffectual through the intrigues of international financiers who seek to obtain concessions at Fiume and the Dalmatian ports and to ruin Italian trade in the Adriatic (Sir R. Rodd, May 5th).May Day. There were no disturbances in any part of Italy. Mr. Erskine takes this as evidence of the determination of every class to show an unbroken front in support of the Government and national claims.. NICARAG DA.Invasion of Costa Rica. Sir A. Young (Guatemala) reports that Costa Rica revolutionaries, under the leadership of Castro Quesado, have organised an expedition for the invasion of Costa Rica. The Nicaraguan Government is lending covert assistance.PORTUGAL.Labour Situation. Tramway and municipal employees in Lisbon are on strike. The Government seems incapable of dealing with the situation and the municipality has resigned.   No disturbance took place on May 1st (Sir L. Carnegie, May 2nd).SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Fiume. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Rome forwards a report that Italian troops are being concentrated in Fiume and its neighbourhood.One British battalion is to remain at Fiume. Otherwise British troops are to be-withdrawn from the Adriatic (Foreign Office, May 3rd).Relations with Atistria. Lord Acton has been informed by the Serbian Minister at Berne that the Serbian Government, in collaboration with the Swiss Government, intends to work for a rapprochement with Austria and to resist any scheme for the union of the latter with Germany.UNITED STATES.The League of Nations. Lord Reading reports that a Conference is being summoned by the Republican Party in order to pronounce upon the policy to be pursued by the Party with regard to the League of Nations. At present the tendency is to concentrate criticism on Article 10 and the failure to deal satisfactorily with the question of immigration. Senators Borah, Reed, and Poindexter will oppose the entry, under any conditions, of the United States into the League, but Lord Reading does not anticipate that the Senate will withhold ratification of the amended covenant.The Republican Press, supported by Hearsts Pan-American papers, criticises the revised Covenant on the following grounds : (1) Article 10 is likely to promote war since it encourages international interference in purely domestic affairs. (2) The clause binding members of the League to uphold the territorial integrity of the League as such means the maintenance of a large standing army by the United States for the benefit of European nations. (3) The Monroe Doctrine is treated as an &quot;international understanding,&quot; thereby reserving for members of the League the right of interference in the internal affairs of America. The preponderance of the British Empire&apos;s votes is also criticised. The general opinion of the Press, however, appears to be that the American nation is in favour of the League in its revised form (Mr. Barclay, May 5th).
ENEMY &amp;ROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Hungary. According to the latest reports from Budapest, on the Rumanian front the Hungarian Red Army holds the line of the Theiss and has retaken the bridgehead at Szolnok (at the junction of the Theiss and the Zagyva, 50 miles south-west of Budapest). On the northern front the Czecho-Slovak troops have reached Eger (south of Miskolcz, 70 miles north-west of Budapest). On May 5th the Korr Bureau announced that order had been re-established in the army area and in the ranks of the Red Army itself. The Soviet Government has placed all troops fighting on the different fronts under a unified Central Command. Wilhelm Boehm has been appointed to the Supreme Command (May Oth).The Government has ordered a general mobilisation of the proletariat. The People&apos;s Commissary, Joseph Haubrich, has been appointed to command the armed forces in Budapest which has been declared a military zone (Budapest, May 3rd).Bela Run has addressed a note to the Czecho-Slovak, Jugo-Slav and Rumanian Governments, in which he states that the Hungarian Soviet Government unreservedly recognises the national and territorial claims of the aforesaid Governments. In return the Hungarian Soviet Government demands the immediate suspension of hostilities, non-intervention in the internal affairs of Hungary, and the conclusion of agreements for free transit-traffic corresponding to the economic interests of both parties (Budapest, April 30th).German-Austria. Lord Acton learns that only fear of military intervention by the Allies has prevented the outbreak of a Bolshevik revolution in Vienna.GERMANY.Political Situation. (1) General. Sir W. Townley has received information through a Dutch source with regard to the views expressed by General Luttwitz. The latter asserted that both the excesses and numbers of the Spartacist Party had been greatly exaggerated in the Press, In Munich there were not more than 600 genuine members of the Red army. The reported army of 32,000 was composed of armed workmen, and the value of such &quot; troops &quot; was shown by the ease with which the Red Guards were defeated at Brunswick at the first exhibition of force. He believed that Communism was gaining ground and that propaganda was a far more effective weapon in the hands of the Spartacists than arms.(The following notes are taken from German Wireless Reports, the dates of which are given in brackets.): (2) Bavaria. After an ineffectual attempt on April 30th by the Munich authorities to conclude an armistice, Government troops entered the town on May 1st, and the Soviet Government was overthrown (May 3rd and 5th). Herren Egelhofer, Toller, Landauer, and Levien were arrested. The two first were shot. Resistance continues in a few suburbs (May 5th).(3) Ruhr District. The Ruhr miners have published a new list of demands which/includes : (1) Increase of wages ; (2) a holiday on full pay ; (3) a commission to consider the question of a six-hour shift; (4) abolition of capitalism in the mining industry; (5) allowances for district councils; (6) recognition of the four miners&apos; organisations as sole representatives of the interests of German miners (May.4th).(A)),Silesia. To avoid further losses through strikes in Silesia it has been decided to make work compulsory.7994- ah&apos; BIrish Demands. On May 4th Judge Coalan issued a statement explaining Irish demands.. Ireland protested, he asserted, against any form of government hy England, whether good or bad, and desired complete independence (Mr. Barclay, May 7th).The Press and Japan. The Tress regards the settlement of Kiao Chow and Shantung as a triumph for Japanese diplomacy. Disappointment is expressed that the Conference has not upheld China&apos;s integrity in conformity with the Presidents Fourteen Points (Mr. Barclay, May 5th).
(5) Thuringen. Imperial troops on the way to Bavaria have been concentrated in the district of Gotha and Erfurt. This has led to protests by the Extremists in these districts.In Jena a general strike has broken out as a protest against the presence of the troops.   This strike, however, only lasted one day (May 2nd).(6) Brunswick. It has been decided to establish a Coalition Government, consisting of two Majority Socialists, two Independents, and one bourgeois member (May 1st).The Reichswehr. The Germania and Berliner Tageblatt of April 4th give particulars of the formation and organisation of the Provisional &quot; Reichswehr.&quot; The latter is to be composed of already existing war formations and approved volunteer forces organised as follows : (a) (1) of groups with group troops ; (2) large (12,230) and small brigades ; (3) troops directly under the command of the Minister for War; (b) of volunteers (Volkswehre). In addition to the old partition into 24 Corps Districts, which is retained for recruiting purposes, Germany is to be divided into four groups: Gruppenkommando Norcl, Gruppenkommaudo sud, Gruppenkommando Liittwitz, Gruppenkommando Bavaria. General von Luttwitz&apos;s command has a special composition. The estimated establishment of the Reichswehr is 300,000 men.Prussian Civic Guards. According to the Lokal-Anzeiger of April 17th the Prussian Government has determined upon the establishment of local civic guards (Einwohnwehre) as a protection against the &quot; growing insecurity in town and country.&quot;The Chemical Industry. Attention is directed to a Memorandum (G.T. 7150) issued by the General Staff on the Chemical Industry in Germany as affected by military considerations. Subjoined to this Memorandum is the Report of the British Mission which visited those chemical factories in the occupied zone engaged in the production of munitions of war. The Report draws attention to the establishment of the combination known as the I.G., which to a great extent enabled Germany to continue the war in spite of the blockade, and to the remarkable expansion of factories engaged in the manufacture of munitions of war. The Report states that &quot; for military security it is essential that each country should have its chemical industry firmly established, and this must be secured as one of the conditions of peace, as otherwise &quot;we are leaving Germany in possession of a weapon which will be a permanent menace to the peace of the world. The key to Germany&apos;s war-production of explosives was the Haber process for the production of ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen. . . . During the war, owing to the extension of the Iiaber plants at Oppau and Merseburg, Germany has become independent of foreign countries for her supplies of ammonia and nitric acid, substances indispensable for the &quot;manufacture not only of high explosives but also of fertilisers for food production. ... In the event of another war, we might be cut off from supplies of saltpetre, while Germany would be independent of them. Tlie resources of the German dye industry [as affecting the manufacture of gas] are of no less military importance.&quot;   The Report concludes : &quot; Tims, at the time of the Armistice, Germany is left with a chemical industry which has a greater productive capacity than it had before the war. But in spite of this, there is no reason why she should regain her former position in the world&apos;s chemical market, provided that measures are taken to assist the chemical industry in Allied countries during the period of reconstruction. The general impression gained by the Mission was that the technical practice in the factories visited was not markedly superior to that obtaining in England at the end of the war, and in some respects it-was inferior. The main source of the strength of the German chemical industry appeared to lie in its organisation and in the large scale of its production, which had been made possible by the ample financial support it had received.&quot;Recommendations (which it is suggested should be included in the peace.terms) are made, inter alia, for the establishment of chemical industries including the Haber process on a firm basis in other countries, the supply by Germany to the Allies of chemical products at reasonable prices, the control of chemical works in the occupied zone, the destruction of existing stocks of explosives and poison gases in Germa ny Measures for the destruction of chemical factories in the event of the renewal of hostilities, and the promotion of British chemical industries.Railways. The Constitution Committee at Weimar has decided almost unani-mously in favour of a united German State railway system (Nauen, May 1st).
NEUTRAL GROUP.ARG ENTINA.Anarchistic Literature. A police edict was issued on May 5th prohibiting publications without previous permission, and forbidding the sale and distribution of anarchistic literature (Sir R. Tower, May Oth).BALTIC PROVINCES.Military Situation. (1) General.-Lettish delegates who recently visited Germany to examine into the state of Lettish prisoners of war state that there are 5,000 officers and men who could be formed into serviceable troops if transported to Libau (Sir C. Marling, April 30th). Prince Lieven is proceeding to Berlin to negotiate for the release of Russian prisoners for enrolment in his volunteer force with which he intends to advance beyond the frontier of Latvia (Mr. Grant Watson, May 2nd).(2) Esthonia. The Bolsheviks have launched violent attacks in the direction of Pskov, Marienburg, and Volmar (Reval, May 1st). They claim to have captured a number of villages 30 versts north-east of Marienburg (Moscow, May 1st), but confess to a withdrawal from Ruen to positions west of Valk (Moscow, May 2nd). According to the Esfhonian Press Agency at Copenhagen, Narva has fallen (Sir C. Marling, May 5th). -The German Coup. The situation remains unchanged. General von der Goltz has removed the guard from the private houses of the Lettish Ministers but not from the Government offices. There is at present no Government in Latvia. Mr. Grant Watson summarises the Governors anti-Lettish activity as follows: (1) Soldiers under his command arrested the Ministers. (2) German troops disarmed Lettish soldiers (and, according to later reports, continue to do so). (3) Guards under his command prevented the Ministers from resuming office. There are further indications that the Baits are endeavouring to stamp out the Lettish National movement, and are planning to form a new Baltic State under German rule. Reports from the country state that they are ill-treating the peasants who may consequently be forced into the arms of the Bolsheviks. Propaganda conducted by land-owners describes all peasants as Bolsheviks, and therefore unfit to bear arms.The British note to Germany (vide Report No. 117, page 8) is reported to have produced an excellent effect on Lettish opinion (Mr. Grant Watson, April 30th to May 4th).Sir C. Marling draws attention to the necessity for a declaration of policy by the Allied Governments.The Blockade Council has decided to allow no exports to Latvia until further notice (Astoria, April 30th).Esllionia. Negotiations regarding the formation of the new Government are still proceeding. Mr. Paets, the Prime Minister, is of opinion that the British Government should issue a declaration giviug its support to Esthonia on condition that a business Government is established with a moderate programme (Mr. Bosanquet, May 2nd and 3rd).7994-2!) CFood for Bavarian Towns. Lord Acton reports that the Bavarian Legation at Berne is most anxious for the despatch of 300 tons of foodstuffs to Augsberg and Nuremberg as the only means of preventing the working classes of those towns going over to Bolshevism. The Swiss Government is prepared to allow this quantity of foodstuffs to go without definite promises of restitution by the Allies.The Peace Terms. According to an announcement in the German Wireless Reports of May Sth, the newspapers of all parties in Germany, except the Communist Party, complain of the way the German delegates are being treated in Versailles and of the delay that is taking place. Even the Independents ai-e opposed to unconditional acceptance of the Versailles terms. The Communists alone are in favour of a peace of violence. They see in this the best chance of achieving their aims, as it would mean a general upheaval in Germany.
Mr. Poska informed Mr. Bosanquet thai; lie had received information from Helsingfors to the effect that, in view of the danger of a peace being signed between Esthonia and the Bolsheviks, the Finnish Government was prepared to furnish assistance to Esthonia. Mr. Poska thought that the country&apos;s dependence on Great Britain for supplies would militate against the conclusion of a separate peace (Mr. Bosanquct, April 30th). A Foreign Office telegram (May 2nd) draws attention to the urgent necessity for a decision with regard to Baltic policy.CHILE.Ministry. His Majesty&apos;s representative reformed as follows : Prime Minister Foreign AffairsJustice       - - -Finance  -WarPublic Worksreports   that the Ministry has been*   Sehor Hevia.- Senor Barros Borgono. Senor Bamirez.- Sehor Claro.- Seiior Bermudez.- Senor Oryan.FINLAND.Recognition. The following arguments are adduced in favour of the recognition of Finland : (1) General Mannerheim offers the best guarantee against an outbreak of Bolshevism, and therefore his position should be strengthened ; (2) Dr. Flolsti, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is pro-Entente ; (3) the Finnish Government has shown its goodwill by expelling the two chief German agents in Finland and by agreeing to a conference with representatives of the Red Finnish Legion in North Russia (Foreign Office, May 1st).According to the latest telegrams it was decided on May 3rd that Great Britain and the United States should recognise the independence of Finland (Astoria, May Oth). The news was received with the general approbation of the Diet (Mr. Bell, May 6th).Assistance against Bolsheiusm. According to the Helsingfors Press (April 30th), in reply to an interpellation, in the Diet, the Prime Minister declared that although not following any policy of annexation, the Finnish Government was not seeking to hinder Finnish Nationals from rendering active assistance to their kinsmen in Olonetz in their struggle against the Bolshevik terror. After the conclusion of Mr. CastreiFs statement, the Diet moved by 106 votes against 80 the resumption of the business of the clay (Mr. Bell, April 30th).Invasion of Russia. Mr. Lindley (Archangel) learns that the Finnish force which crossed the Russian frontier (vide Report No. 116, page 9) was composed of activists whose object was not to fight Bolshevism, but to incorporate into Finland Russian territory in the neighbourhood of Lakes Onega and Ladoga.MEXICO.Congress. Mr. Cummins reports that Carranza opened Congress on May 1st. No reference was made in his speech to foreign relations.Rebel Activity. Increased rebel activity is reported from Puerto Mexico and an attack is expected on that place and on Minatitlan (Air. Cummins, April 29th).SPAIN.Dissolution of the Cortes. Owing to the difficulty experienced by Sehor Maura in carrying out his original programme which consisted in passing the Budget without delay, and then dissolving the Cortes, he presented the resignation of the Cabinet to the King on May 2nd. The King ratified his confidence in the Government, but Sehor Maura considered it impossible to govern with the present Cortes, and a decree was signed by the King the same afternoon dissolving the Cortes. The elections will take place in the beginning of June.   His Majesty&apos;s representative at Madrid anticipates

A labour demonstration took place in Madrid on May 1st in which some 80,000 persons participated. A collision occurred with the police as the result, according to the official version, of an attempt to attack the Bank of Spain.Elsewhere in Spain the clay passed quietly (Mr. Crackauthorpe, May 2nd).SWITZERLAND.Vorai-lberg. It is reported in the Press that the National Assembly of Vorarlberg has decided to submit the question of union of Vorarlberg with Switzerland, to a referendum (Lord Acton, April 28th).Monthly Ration.
