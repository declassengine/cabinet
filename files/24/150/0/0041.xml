WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.NOTE.-In accordance with a decision of the War Cabinet (August 19th, Minutes 617. 5) the &quot; Western and General,&quot; &quot; Eastern,&quot; and the foreign portion of the &quot; British Empire and Africa &quot; weekly Reports will be combined after the 1st of October in a &quot; Foreign Countries &quot; Report, issued fortnightly.THE BALTIC STATES.German Aggression. Colonel Tallents reported on August 25th that on Von der Goltz&apos;s return to Mitau the German troops seized the opportunity to renew their demands for grants of land. Von der Goitz in reply issued an order expressing sympathy with the men&apos;s demands, but at the same time urging the necessity for the maintenance of discipline. Meanwhile, the evacuation has again been held up pending the German Governments decision on the land question- Von der Goltz is relying on Bermont for help in establishing the Baltic States as a military corridor between Germany and Russia.Colonel Tallents is convinced that the following measures are necessary :  (1) acceleration in the equipment of Lettish troops ; (2) Allied control of the German evacuation ; (3) a strict embargo on the importation of war material from Germany by means of Allied control of the frontier ; (4) the stoppage of Russian reinforcements for Bermont.On the other hand, attention may be drawn to the following announcement in the German Wireless of August 27th: &quot; The refusal by the German troops in the Baltic Provinces to obey the Governments orders finds no support in the German Press. Even the newspapers of the Right, which sympathise with the troops, do not-contradict the declaration of the Government that the refusal of the troops to evacuate the Baltic Provinces would be an infringement of the Peace Treaty. The Govern-ment is determined to do its part in complying with the decisions of the Peace Treaty, and leave no doubt that it regards the revolt of the German troops to be directed as much against the German as against the Lettish Government.&quot;Situation in Esthonia. -A telegram (August 29th) has been received from the Deputy Commissioner at Reval stating that disapprobation of the present Government is widespread and may lead to serious demonstrations on the part of the populace. Some of the troops are not considered trustworthy for use against the working classes In the event of riots. The cause of this dissatisfaction is the uneven distribution of food and the alleged corruption of the responsible Minister and his friends.A Bolshevik printing press has been seized and Bolshevik agents denounced to the General Staff.The Politiken publishes a telegram from Reval dated August 29th, asserting that owing to the fall of Pskov, which occurred on the 26th, and the rout of the Northern Russian Army, the Esthonian government has entered into peace negotiations with the Bolsheviks (Mr. Ramsay, August 30th).According to the latest reports received from the Deputy Commissioner at Reval, a popular outbreak has been avoided owing to the firm attitude of the Government, and some 90 extremists have been deported.Mr. Ramsay (Stockholm) states that the Estbonian Government has rejected the Bolshevik peace proposals, though the terms offered were very favourable. In addition to this, Esthonia has recognised the North-West Russian Government, and is prepared to negotiate terms whereon the North-West Russian Government may have access to the sea through Esthonian ports.Germany and the North-West Russian Government. The German Wireless of August 28th gives vent to the following opinions :  &quot; German bourgeois politicians approve of the attempt to overcome Bolshevism. .n Russia with the aid of the freshly formed North-West Russian Government,
supported by England. They utter a warning, however, against undue optimism so long as the Soviet Government can count on the Red troops, who, alone of the inhabitants of Russia, have enjoyed good conditions of living. It is doubtful whether there will be any radical change in.the internal situation in Russia before the winter. The loss of Retrograd woidd not necessarily mean the collapse of Bolshevism in Moscow.&quot;And again on August 27th : &quot; The proclamation of the British General Gough to the bourgeois of Petrograd, concerning their impending liberation from the tyranny of the Bolsheviks, is welcomed in the German Democratic Press. It is pointed out that, even in Russia itself, the genuine Democratic groups desire the restoration of the Constituent Assembly and the establishment of a Provisional Government, after Bolshevism has been removed.&quot; The Bolsheviks have no right to protest against foreign intervention for the liberation of Russia, after they themselves have brought Russia to a position where-foreign intervention is inevitable.&quot;The Bolshevik Offensive. According to the Soviet Military Report the Bolsheviks have reached a point 15 versts west of Pskov.At a military conference held at Riga on August 26th plans for a joint offensive against the Bolsheviks were agreed upon provided that the political situation permitted of their realisation (Colonel Tallents, August 28th).Recent Events in the Baltic Slates. Attention is drawn to a Memorandum (G.T. 8089) giving a narrative of events in the Baltic States from the time of the Armistice, November 1918, up to August 1919, with special reference to action taken by General Gough with the object of combating German influence and assisting the national Governments in their defensive organisation against the Bolsheviks.BELGIUM.Work of the British Commission. Mr. Herbert Samuel has issued a report (July 31st, 1919) on the work of the British Commission to Belgium. The main causes which led to the formation of this Commission were the unsatisfactory attitude of Belgian opinion towards Great Britain, clue in large measure to disappointment in the decisions of the Peace Conference, serious economic conditions, unemployment, lack of raw materials, and the unfavourable rate of exchange. The Commission was well received by the Press, officials, and the public. Negotiations were entered upon, and in some cases concluded, for (1) preventing the further depreciation of the franc, (2) opening credits for Belgium in India and the Dominions, (3) facilitating imports from the United Kingdom, (1) removing the restrictions on Belgian exports to the United Kingdom, (5) formulating a financial agreement, (6) reconstructing the devastated regions, (7) establishing Antwerp as a base for the Army of the Rhine, (8) improving telegraphic, communications, &amp;c.In conclusion a favourable picture is drawn of the future of Anglo-Belgian trade.CHINA.Tibet Frontier Question. Sir J. Jordan reported on August 27th that the negotiations on the Tibetan boundary, when in sight of final agreement, had come abruptly.to an end. The ostensible reason given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs was that the Government would have difficulty in carrying the proposals through Parlia-ment, but Sir J. Jordan elicited the confession that the real reason was Japanese intervention supported by the military party, which has thrown in its lot entirely with Japan.Sir J. Jordan considered the abandonment of these negotiations, against the personal convictions of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as the climax of the Press campaign engineered by the Japanese Legation and as a direct challenge to the British position in Asia.Japan and Railway Construction. Sir J. Jordan strongly protests against the granting of special privileges to Japan for railway construction in Manchuria and Mongolia and the exploitation of their countries exclusively for the benefit of one
Power. Any such action would imperil the new scheme for international co-operation in railway construction which has already met with the approval of a considerable portion of the Chinese people as opposed to the military or autocratic party. If Japan prefers to remain isolated Sir J. Jordan suggests that the other members of the consortium should proceed to develop internationally the extensive and valuable concessions which they each possess. The Chinese people would favour such a policy as strongly as they would oppose the particularist policy of Japan. Moreover, there can be no comparison between international co-operation for the unification of the entire railway system of China and the alienation of certain regions for the exclusive benefit of a single Power (Sir J&apos;. Jordan, August 26th) (see also under &quot;Japan&quot;).Partition of Asia. A dangerous Memorandum has been published in the New York Times by T. P. Millard, whose anti-British and anti-Japanese sentiments are well known, and has been widely circulated in the Pekin Press to the effect that the -whole of Asia has been divided into British, French, and Japanese spheres of action. The French Legation has published a categorical denial (Sir J. Jordan, August 30th).CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.The Faxmre of Tcschen. The following information is given in a Wireless Report from Prague (August 29th) : &quot;A message from Marschall, President of the Inter-Allied Commission at Teschen, to the Peace Conference, Paris, states that in consequence of articles in the Press, according to which the question of Teschen will soon be settled in favour of the Poles, there is great unrest and discontent in the Silcsian region occupied by the Czechs and in Moravia. The Czechish miners and railway workers of this region have struck and the train service has ceased.&quot; Representatives of 50,000 Czechish and German workmen and of the Czechish population have expressed a wish that the Peace Conference should be informed of this situation and of their national aspirations and wish to know if and how the question has been decided. They state that order cannot be re-established in the country until the workmen, know whether the question has been settled in favour of the Czechs. The workmen declare that their aims are purely national and in no way influenced by Bolshevism.&quot;Mr. Gosling (Prague) corroborates the statement that feeling is running high.FINLAND.The Fed Legion. An agreement has now been reached between the Finnish Government and the deputation of the Finnish Red Legion as to the conditions on Avhich members of the Legion may be permitted to return from Murmansk to Finland (Foreign Office, August 30th).According to a report from Sir C. Keunard considerable agitation is being worked up in the Press against the return of the Red Legion, and the Government is being seriously criticised for signing the agreement. The agitation may be considered, however, in the light of a personal attack on Dr. Holsti engineered by the pro-monarchical and pro-German elements who appear to be supporting General Mannerheim as Finland&apos;s strong man.Nev; Issue of Rouble Notes. A Press telegram from Helsingfors (August 26th) makes the following statement : &quot; The interim notes issued some time ago by the North-West Russian Govern -ment will shortly be replaced by new notes now being printed at Stockholm to an amount of 350,000,000 roubles.&quot; England has guaranteed for these roubles a rate of exchange of 40 roubles to the pound sterling. The notes will bear the signatures of General Udenitch and Lianosov.   Their circulation will be obligatory in Russian territory.&quot; Three months after the occupation of Petrograd the Bank of Russia will redeem the notes against Government credit notes to unlimited amounts, rouble for rouble. The new issue is to be secured on the entire property of the Russian Empire &quot; (Mr. Ramsay, August 27th).
GERMANY.Failure of the General Strike Movement. A meeting of the Independent Socialist and Communist &quot;Workmen&apos;s Councils in Berlin on August 25th rejected the proposal of the Communists to enter upon a general strike. The proposal of the Executive Council to organise a protest strike was likewise rejected, as was also a proposal to send an ultimatum to the German Government (Nauen, August 26th).At a meeting of representatives of the workmen&apos;s Councils of the Social Democratic Party on August 26th the proceedings taken hy the Government against the Independent-Communist Executive Council were thoroughly approved of. The resolution sharply condemned the criminal attempt of the Independents and Communists to bring about a general strike (Nauen, August 27th).Status of Workmen&apos;s Councils. In connection with the publication of the order for a new election of \Yorkmen&apos;s Councils, the Central Council states : &quot; The new elections of Workmen&apos;s Councils is not directed against the German Constitution, or against the measures taken by the German Government. The newly elected Workmen&apos;s Councils have been convened in order to bridge the gap between the present and future constitutional position as far as the Council organisation is concerned &quot; (Nauen, August 26th).Ilaase on Socialisation. Haase, tbe leader of the Independents, stated at a women&apos;s meeting in Konigsberg thai general socialisation was not so simple as some thought, and could not be carried through all at once, either in industry, banking or commerce. The Government Press points out that Haase by this declaration supports the programme for socialisation adopted by the^-Majority Socialists, and demands that an end should be put to the propaganda of the Independents for immediate socialisation (Naueu, August 26th).Tke Independents and the Soviet System. At a conference of German Workmen&apos;s Councils held at Halle, to which only partisans of the proletarian dictatorship and representatives of the revolutionary workers were admitted, an Independent Deputy of the National Assembly declared that the German proletariat was not sufficiently revolutionary in character to justify a trial, of strength on the Soviet system. In the course of the discussion the doubt was expressed whether the German workers could be induced to strike for revolutionary political ends. Unfortunately, the German worker was lacking in revolutionary driving power (Nauen, August 26th).As complimentary to this, attention may be drawn to Herr BarllPs remarks in the Voricarts. He demands the establishment of a dictatorship of the Moderate parties in order to ensure the development of Germany on republican democratic lines. The danger of a dictatorship of the Reactionaries or of the Communists is very great. The only question is which of the extremists will be more rapid in imposing their dictatorship. For this reason the Moderate parties are urged to take immediate measures against both these opponents, whose only way to power lies through blood and warfare.Tke Situation in Silesia. (1) German Wireless. August 26th. Discussions between the Broslau Government authorities and the Entente Commission began in Breslau on August 25th. After an address of welcome by the President, Philipp, the State Commissioner Horsing described the gradual transition of what was originally a Spartacist movement into a national Polish movement. He pointed out, in defence of his measures, that it was not he that first proclaimed the state of siege, but the Central Soldiers&apos; Council in agreement with the Central People&apos;s Council. Major Hesterberg, Chief of Staff of the German defence troops, established the fact that Polish legionaries and Polish regular troops had taken part in the fighting in Upper Silesia and drew the conclusion therefrom -that it was a question of a well thought out and well prepared Polish plan. Horsing appealed to the members of the Commission for the immediate recall of those Germans who had been deported from Upper Silesia. Both the leader of the Entente Commission and President Philipp expressed their regret that Polish representatives had not taken part in the discussions.August 21th. Although the general strike in Upper Silesia is practically over and work continues to be resumed, it cannot be said that the situation has been absolutely restored, since a large number of insurgents, who fled across the frontier, where they were provided with arms by the Poles, have now returned.   The majorityS8S4-lbV,
of the population, who do not sympathise with Polish &quot;liberation&quot; endure the constant danger of a Polish irruption, combined with a fresh outbreak of Spartacist terror.August 29th. Although the German military tribunal in Beuthen has placed beyond doubt the participation of regular Polish troops in the insurrection in Upper Silesia and thus acknowledged the juridical ground for a state of war between Germany and Poland, the German Government abides by the view that a state of peace, in accordance with international law, still exists between Germany and Poland. The German Government is prepared to accept the explanation that the Polish regular troops, whose presence in Upper Silesia has been proved, had broken away from their regiments without the consent of the Polish military authorities and that their participation in the rebellion in Upper Silesia was against the will of the Polish Government.August 30th. -The following message signed by Herr Midler was sent out from Berlin on August 30th : &quot; The agitation against Germany occasioned by the eArents in Upper Silesia is continuing. The Foreign Press is being mobilised to spread assertions throughout the world about German cruelty and oppression. Naturally those gentlemen, the foreign correspondents, are beyond the frontier and far from the firing lines, but near enough to give their readers the impression that they have obtained their information at first hand and thus give their exaggerations and calumnies the appearance of authentic information obtained on the spot. These methods, as even the Foreign Press rightly points out, recall the notorious atrocity propaganda carried on during the war, and are to be mistrusted on that account. Moreover, the report of the Foreign Military Mission will furnish a real exposition of the facts. These correspondents have forgotten to mention that revolutionary Spartacists in league with Polish Nationalists have appeared in Upper Silesia, murdering and pillaging, and that hundreds of innocent German citizens have been ill-treated and deported as hostages, in spite of the insistent demands of the German Government for their release.&quot; The object of the whole Polish movement is only too clear. The Polish people are to be, if possible, incited to Avar against Germany. The plebiscite provided for in the Peace Treaty is to be prevented or taken under conditions which Avill assure the Poles the determining influence. The premature occupation of Upper Silesia by Polish troops and the establishment of a Polish administration, similar to that in Posen, have failed. Noav the Entente is to be pressed into the service of the Polish cause. The German Government desires peace and the loyal fulfilment of the Peace Treaty.   It will guard its own good right Avith vigilance and determination.&quot;(2) Polish Wireless. August 28th. Desperate fighting without ceasing is continuing between the insurgents and the &quot; Grenzschutz.&quot; The Germans are violating the frontier eA^erywhere. Their patrols often cross the frontier of Galicia and Silesia at Teschen. Enemy aeroplanes bombard places situated on the territory of the Polish State.   Executions continue.August BOth. A message from Warsaw of August 30th mentions tbe presence in Upper Silesia of the Inter-Allied Commission, and expresses the hope that the German participation will not prevent the Commission from getting into touch with the Polish Avorking population.The Committee for the defence of Upper Silesia formed in Posnania denies that the Communist movement in Silesia was fomented by the Poles. On the contrary it is certain that the Polish workers are ready to assure the necessary production of coal on condition (1) That the Grenzschutz is withdrawn.(2) That Polish and Allied troops occupy the district. In view of the Prussian terror Avhich is sapping tbe vitality of the country, the Committee expresses its astonishment at the inaction of the Allies. After suiwiving centuries of Prussian oppression the country is now s\iccumbing under the lukewarm protection of the Allies.(3) Sir P. Wyndham reports (August 30th) that in an interview with the Polish Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the latter stated that there was little hope of work being resumed in the Silesian mines until the &quot; Grenzschutz &quot; Avas withdrawn, and the country occupied by Allied forces. Though the Central Government of Germany was in favour of a settlement, Prussia was encouraging the insurrection.
The Polish Government ,was determined to use every means in its power, short of military intervention, to effect a settlement.A Times correspondent, who has lately retained from Silesia, has informed Sir P. Wyndham that the crisis is temporarily passed, and that the population seems prepared to give the Allied Commission a chance to deal with the situation.Separatism. The following information is given in the German Wireless of August 27th and 29th: &quot; According to the Frankfurter Zeitung, the supporters of the notorious Dr. Dorten French civilians, officers, German Independents, &amp;c.  talk of an impending outbreak in the Palatinate. Rhenish Hesse and Nassau. The majority of the population will oppose any such outbreak with every means in their power, and deal energetically with disturbers of the peace.&quot;In connection with the union of the Independent Socialists in Cologne, Wiesbaden, and the Palatinate with the capitalistic and clerical elements in the interests of a Rhine Republic, the Vossische Zeitung learns from a well-informed source that the Independent Socialists have been accepted as members of an economic combine, which is generously financed with French capital, and pledged to a programme for the establishment of a Rhine Republic. These Independents obtain commodities of prime necessity at unusually low prices. Similar inducements are said to be held out to the Majority Socialists, in order to win them over to Frauce&apos;s scheme for a Rhine Republic. Until now, however, the Majority Socialists have declined to barter their political convictions for cheap food.At a meeting of the Wiesbaden Syndicalists, the President stated that the Syndicalists were the political adherents of the Independent Socialists, and that it. was a matter of indifference to them whether the Government was French, Spanish, English or German. They desired a free Rhenish State, with cheap food. For this reason their watchword was &quot;Freedom from Berlin.&quot;West Prussia. In order to prevent an outbreak similar to that which has occurred in Silesia the Polish Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has drawn Sir P. Wyndham&apos;s attention to the urgent necessity for sending an Allied Commission to West Prussia (Warsaw, August 30th,).Italy and Bavaria. Subject to a definite agreement between Bavaria and the German Government the Italian Government is prepared to arrange import and export trade with Bavaria (Nauen, August 2Sth).German Vieios on Events in Hungary.-Vienna reports concerning the events accompanying the temporary resignation of the Archduke and the reconstruction of the Friedrich Ministry awaken fresh suspicion among German Republicans. Entente agents in Budapest and Vienna are supporting the efforts of the Hungarian rulers to obtain a majority for the Hapsburg domination in the new National Assembly. The Conservative German Press confirms the fact that the Hungarian Monarchist Party is working for a majority in the elections for the National Assembty, especially in the essentially Magyar counties of the plain between the Danube and the Theiss. The success of these efforts would be welcomed by those French politicians who are seeking to found an Anti-German Danube League. These politicians regard the prevention of the union of German-Austria with Germany as ouly a temporary success on the road to a Danube Federation. They are in no way deterred by the possibility that a return to the monarchy in Hungary might be followed by similar new develop-ments in German-Austria and Germany. French Imperialists would rather see Germany reduced to the rank of weak monarchic organisations than the future assured by a great free German State. The oft recurring complaints expressed by French publicists and in the French Chamber that by the Versailles Treaty the French war-aim, namely, the dissolution of German federal unity, has not been attained, are criticised from this point of view in Germany (Naueu, August 29th).Coal Supply. Great satisfaction is evinced in the German Press at France&apos;s concession to Germany in the matter of the amount of coal to be delivered by Germany. Instead of the 40,000,000 tons of coal per annum, stipulated in the Peace Treaty, France has agreed to accept 20,000,000 tons. In view of this result of the negotiations at Versailles the Vossische Zeitung emphasises the urgent need of a speedy improvement in the conditions of &apos; output and transport in Germany. Failing such an improvement the reduction of Germany&apos;s obligation will, under the existing conditions neither terminate Germany&apos;s coal scarcity nor guarantee even the delivery of the obligatory amount.   According to tlie Vossische
sZeitung the result attained is an indication of the possibility of clearing the way to economic work with France by means of mutual goodwill and understanding (Nauen, August 29th).HUNGARY.Tlie New Cabinet. The following list of the members of the new Cabinet formed by M. Friedrich to succeed the Archduke Josephs Government was published in The Times of August 29th : Premier ami Minister of the Interior       -   M. Friedrich..Minister for Foreign Affairs        - -   Count Emmerich Czaky.Minister of Agriculture - -   M. Julius Rubinek.Minister of Commerce     - - -   M. Franz Heinrick.Minister of Finance - M. Johann Gruenn.Minister of War   - General Sclmetzer.Minister of Food      - M. Karl Huszar.Minister of Justice - - -   M. Georg Baloghy.Minister for National Minorities - -   M. Jacob Bleyer.Minister of Public Health        - -   M. Andreas Csillery.Minister of Propaganda   - - -   M. Stefan Haller.Minister for Small Farmers     - -   M. Stefan Szabo.Minister for Industrial Workers  - -   M. Daniel Clah.The German and part of the German-Austrian Press, in commenting on the above, express doubts as to the vitality of the new Cabinet, whose character is declared to be frankly reactionary.The Budapest correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung reports an anti-Semitic demonstration there, which originated in a mass meeting of Christian Socialists and Nationalists. The demonstrators sent a deputation to the Entente Mission demanding that no Jews should be included in the Government (German Wireless, August 28th).The new Hungarian Cabinet is viewed with disfavour by the whole Press of Vienna, with the exception of the clerical newspapers, the Reichspost and the Deutsches Volkblatt (August 29th).Wireless Reports of the Situation. The following have been intercepted : German Wireless, Nauen. According to Vienna reports from Budapest, the Hungarian crisis is further than ever from a final solution. The Prime Minister Friedrich is still in power, although the Entente Missions are unwilling to recognise him. A military dictatorship seems to be impending and an intensified state of siege has been proclaimed over the whole of Hungary. The Budapest magistrates have suspended 2s2 teachers and instituted disciplinary proceedings against them for supporting Bolshevism (August 2Sth).The fight for power in Budapest continues. Tbe Prime Minister Friedrich has issued a proclamation declaring that he will abandon his positiou only at the command of the Entente, as his retirement would mean the recrudescence of Bolshevism under a thin disguise. Further, the Prime Minister states that he is willing to retire from his post should peace and order be assured and the smooth course of the elections appear to be guaranteed, but he refuses to quit his post in order to make room for the personal ambitions of other parties, in connection with this proclamation Vorwclrts remarks that the Hapsburgs are hatching plans in Switzerland for their restoration to the throne. In the meantime the famished people of Hungary are threatened with the renewal of the blockade.According to the correspondent of the Wien Expresse 160,000 persons have acquired German-Austrian nationality. Part of these new German-Austrian citizens are German-Bohemians and Moravians, others are Galiciah refugees. Latterly many fresh refugees have poured into Vienna from Hungary.The Wiener Mittagspost states that, despite their internment, the former Communist leaders of Budapest, Bela Kun, Kunfi and handier, are still able to keep in touch with their agents in ATenna and Budapest and avail themselves for the purposes of agitation of the millions of money concealed by the discharged Communist officials of the Hungarian Legation in Vienna. Kun has sent through Rumania and the Ukrainian Bolshevik President, Rakovski, a request to Lenin for further financial support, as he hopes to recapture power in Hungary at an early date.
100,000 adherents of the Communist Government in Budapest are secretly-armed (August 31st).Hungarian Wireless, Budapest. Groups of workmen, employees and suh-ordinate State officials of Szegedin representing 35,000 men have sent a deputation to Budapest to deliver a note to the Generals of the Entente Commission informing them of their refusal to recognise any Government which does not include Garami and Varjassy.The working class of Szegedin, the second town in Hungary, was the first to rally to the side of anti-Soviet Government. &quot;Varjassy, whom the Friedrich Cabinet have appointed Minister Plenipotentiary in Paris, refused to accept the appointment on the ground that he cannot accept the mandate of a Government which is. not distinctly ententO-phil (August 31st). -The following message has been sent by M. Diamandy, the Rumanian High Commissioner in Hungary, to M. Bratiano : &quot; His Eminence, Cardinal Chesernoch, Primate of Hungary, who came to see me, expressed his thanks for the presence of the Rumanian army in Budapest, and for the manner in which the troops have behaved towards the population &quot; (August 28th).Rumanian Demands. A message has been received from Admiral Troubridge (September 1st) stating that the Rumanians demand the immediate acceptance of the following conditions by the Hungarian Government: (1) An immediate customs union with Rumania. (2) The occupation of Hungary for one year with the object of giving an opportunity for preparing the country for personal union with Rumania. (3) The cession of strategic points near Szegedin on the mouth of the Maros river. (4) No treaties to be made with the Jugo-Slavs or Great Britain. The Rumanians state that they have already formed an alliance with Italy in which the Hungarians must join in order to assume a policy of encirclement of Jugo-Slavia.JAPAN.Japanese and the Railway Consortium. In an unofficial conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr. Alston learnt that the Government and the Opposition had reached an unanimous decision that Japan could not allow international control of railways in those spheres, especially Manchuria and Mongolia, where her interests were vitally concerned.   (See also under &quot; China.&quot;)NETHERLANDS.The Negotiations with Belgium. Mr. Robertson reports (August 29th) that in an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the latter, after assuring him that the Government had every intention of continuing the negotiations, said that the Netherlands Government had cause to complain of the Belgians. If they had come to him after the armistice and frankly stated their wishes in regard to canals and waterways they would have been received with open arms. Instead of this they had appealed to the Great Powers without consulting- Holland at all, they had intrigued behind the backs of the Dutch and openly spoken of annexing Dutch territory. Even now it was not too late for the Belgian Government to approach the Netherlands Government direct instead of under the tutelage of the Great Powers. They would be received in the most friendly spirit and an agreement could be easily reached.Mr. Robertson continues that, according to information obtained from a Belgian financier of good standing, &quot; the annexation party in Belgium is led by the Comite de Politique Nationale, and includes many members of the General Staff and of the Government, but only represents about 5 per cent, of the population. Moderate elements and the vast majority of the population are against annexation. At the same time rumours which have been spread in regard to the tone and substance of Monsieur van Swinderen&apos;s curt speech at the Conference are convincing even the moderates that the Dutch attitude is absolutely uncompromising, and that nothing-can come of the Paris negotiations. The annexationists are clamouring for the occupation of Limburg (which would be an extremely easy military operation, requiring a few hours), and even of Dutch. Flanders, and are relying on the support of French, volunteers.    They would, then confront Europe with a -fail accompli as did the888-1- It C
Rumanians. The moderates feel that if the Dutch would at&apos; once consent to the internationalisation of the mouth of the Scheldt, the canalisation of. the Meuse from Liege to Venlo, and the construction of a canal from Antwerp to Duishurg, this would eliminate all danger.&quot;If the above truly represents the state of mind in Belgium, I (Mr. Robertson) can only regard the situation as grave in the extreme. I doubt if the Dutch would consent to the internationalisation of the mouth of the Scheldt or to any alienation of their sovereignty over it, but of this I am not absolutely sure. As regards canals, they are quite ready to be accommodating, though the question of cost will be difficult to settle. The occupation of Dutch territory would mean war to the last man, no matter what the odds against the Dutch. They will never consent to the alienation of Dutch territory, or to share with the Belgians sovereignty over canals and waterways in Dutch territory, or to Belgian military interference in the defence of Limburg, or indeed to anything that derogates from their full and complete sovereignty- over Dutch territory as now defined.&quot;NORWAY.Future of Spitzbergen. Mr. Ovey (Christiania) adduces several reasons for giving Norway sovereignty in preference to a mandate over Spitzbergen : (1) The proposal of a mandate as emanating from Sweden would be unpopular ; (2) the eventuality of war between Norway and Sweden is so remote that the necessity for a special measure of conciliation on the part of the former does not arise ; (3) it is to Great Britain&apos;s interest to support Nor\vay&apos;s claims for commercial and political reasons in return for services rendered during the war ; ingratitude would be a useful weapon in the hands of the German propagandist; (-1) Spitzbergen is inhabited almost entirely by Norwegians ; (5) the alternative of a mandate might be used as a lever to secure from Norway protection for British interests ; and finally (6) whatever decision is reached by the Conference will be attributed to British influence.PERU.Recognition of the Government. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Lima telegraphs as follows : &quot; My American colleague is to-day (August 30th) according de facto recognition to the Government, which has already been done by me in accordance with instructions.&quot; The election took place without enthusiasm, but without disorder, and a large majority in favour of the Government is indicated.&quot;SERBIA, AND SERB-CROAT-SLOVENE KINGDOM.The Rumanian Threat. Sir C. des Graz reports that continued anxiety is felt by Serbia as to Rumanian designs on the Banat. In accordance with the decisions of the Paris Conference the Jugo-Slavs have retired behind the line allotted to them and have thus abandoned many strategic points, but they are prepared to fight if attacked. \.M. Davidovitch, the President of the Council, has earnestly requested the Rumanian Minister to assure his Government that the Serbian Government has maintained and wishes to continue the friendliest relations between the two countries.His Majesty&apos;s representative at Bucharest has received information showing that Serbia&apos;s fears are not unwarranted.Italian Relations.

A. garbled version of tbe interview appeared in the Politiken and resulted in an official dementi by Mr. Hellner.THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Intervention in Mexico.
