SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND GENERALREPORT No. 122.General.The negotiations lor peace with Germany and German-Austria have now reached a climax which will leave its mark on world history. The Allied and Associated Powers are considering the plea of the German Delegation that some of the terms offered are in conflict with President Wilson&apos;s &quot;points.&quot; The Austrian Delegation has pleaded for the avoidance of delay on account of the danger of conflicts and bloodshed upon the undetermined frontiers.The present situation affecting trade restrictions is summarised on page 2. Neither Scandinavian countries nor Switzerland seem inclined to aid in a reiinposition of blockade measures against Germany (see pages 9 and 10).Allied Countries.China (page 2). Proposals have been submitted for the settlement of the Tibet question with His Majesty&apos;s Government.Southern Slav States (page 3).--There are indications of probable .frontier difficulties between Serbia and Rumania.The Serbian militaay occupation of Montenegro continues.Enemy Countries.Austria-Hungary (page -1). A valuable report on the internal situation in Hungary is summarised. The point is clearly brought out that there is less individual freedom under a Bolshevik dictatorship than under an absolute monarchy.The Allied and Associated Powers disapprove of the Rumanian proposal to march on Buda-Pest.Conflicts are reported between Slavs and German-Austrians in Styria and Carinthia.Germany (page 5); The German counter-proposals for a compromise on the Peace Terms have been published by German Wireless.Interesting reports are quoted about the movement in the Rhineland towards separation from Prussia, and in the Palatinate towards separation from the German Confederation.The movement in a certain section of the Press to create an anti-British Russia in sympathy with Germany is worthy of attention.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Relaxation of Trade Restrictions. A Board of Trade memorandum (G.T. 7363) summarises the facts relative to the resumption of trade with Germany and Austria. The allied and Associated Governments have decided that (1) trade should be permitted with the occupied territories of the Rhine, (2) foodstuffs within certain limits as to quantity should be allowed to be imported into unoccupied Germany from Allied and neutral countries, and &quot;approved&quot; goods (i.e., all goods except war material, gold, silver, and securities) should be allowed to be exported to Allied and neutral countries from unoccupied Germany towards payment for the&apos; foodstuffs, (3) resumption of trade should be allowed with the territories previously included within the Empire of Austria. In pursuance of these decisions the Board of Trade has issued licences to British firms authorising (1) the supply of goods in general from the United Kingdom to the occupied territories, (2) the export of foodstuffs to the whole of Germany, (3) the supply of goods in general to Austria. Imports into the United Kingdom from Germany and Austria are at present prohibited.League of Nations. It is intended to hold the first meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations at Washington in October (Astoria, May 30th).ALLIED  GROUP.CHINA.Tibet. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has handed Sir J. Jordan a note containing the Chinese proposals for the settlement of the Tibet question. The proposals include (1) the insertion in the Treaty of a statement that Tibet forms part of Chinese territory, (2) the appointment of Chinese commissioners to trade marts, (3) the recognition by an autonomous Tibet of Chinese suzerainty, (4) settlement of the boundaries. Sir J. Jordan considers the conclusion of a Treaty based on such proposals desirable and possible, though modifications should be made with regard to the Chinese suggestions as to boundaries and Great Britain should be represented at Lhassa as a counter-concession to (2).CUBA..(&quot;&quot; Strike. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Plavana reports that normal conditions once more prevail and that most of the strikers have returned to work. On May 30th Congress gave the President power to suspend constitutional guarantees in order that he might deal effectively with agitators.FRANCE.The Socialist Press and the Peace Terms. The following utterance of Populaire is characteristic of the general attitude : &quot; These tactics have already been tried with success ; the Bolsheviks signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, but never recognised that they were bound by this pact of violence. This attitude has borne the fruits that we have seen. No doubt the German people, momentarily strangled by the Allied imperialism, will be shortly delivered by the Entente proletariats.&quot;Mr. Mayeras (Verite, May 15th) deals with the same question : &quot; If the capitalistic regime is to survive the war, I do not see how France can reduce her armaments. On. the contrary. It would even be imprudent to demobilise completely, for this organisation of the Sarre is the most infernally and stupidly conceived wasp&apos;s nest
that anyone could dream of. There is in it material enough to poison the life of Europe mure than the rascality of Bismarck poisoned it in 1871.&quot;M. Sambat, in the Heure, states : &quot; We want a true Society of Nations. The capital defect that vitiates all the work of Versailles is not choosing between the work of war and the work of peace.&quot;There is a tendency to emphasise the financial side of the cpiestion and to point out the disadvantageous position of France.The Strikes. Lord Derby reports that the unions of metal workers and mechanics in the Paris district have decreed a general strike beginning on June 2nd. Their grievance appears to be that the masters have refused to raise their pay for piece work so as to prevent the decrease in wages resulting from the application of the eight hours&apos; day. Three hundred thousand men are said to be affected. The miners of the Pas de Calais are also reported to have struck.JAPAN.Corea. Mr. Alston (Tokio) continues to receive reports on the atrocities committed by Japanese gendarmerie and military authorities in Corea.SOUTITEPcN SLAV STATES.Recognition. According to a Renter message to Tlie Times (June 30th) the British Government has recognised the kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes.The Toronto!. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Bucharest reports that considerable feeling has been aroused with regard to the cession of the Torontal (Banat) to Serbia. The Serbian representative is convinced that the Rumanian Government will not accept a peace which does not give the Torontal to Rumania, and that it is intended to occupy the country with Rumanian troops in spite of the decisions of the Peace Conference. M. Bratiano has declared his intention to resign rather than sign a treaty abandoning the Torontal to Serbia. Mr. Rattigan thinks that this attitude may be considered as bluff, and that the principal cause of Rumanian resentment is to be found in the loss of a section of the Temsvar-Szeged railway.Montenegro. Count de Salis reports from Scutari (May 27th) that a Serbian division is in occupation of Montenegro. On April 20th the Montenegrin Governing-Committee was broken up, and its powers transferred to a Serbian delegate. The five Montenegrin prefects of provinces have been replaced by Serbians, and the adiniui-stration at Cettinje has been taken out of the hands of Montenegrin officials. As a result considerable difficulty is experienced in ascertaining the real wishes of the people.Count de Salis is of opinion that the majority of the population are in favour of some form of federal union with Serbia, but strongly averse to incorporation. On the eastern frontier there is necessarily attraction towards Serbia, but the King has a strong following among the peasants, especially in the neighbourhood of Cettinje.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Socialism and the Jews. According to the Weekly Report on Revolutionary Movements Abroad (G.T. 7368) issued by the Home Secretary, it is estimated that 25 per cent, of the American Socialist Party are Jews. Ninety per cent, of the Jews in America are said to be Socialist in spirit as the natural result of their treatment in Russia and Rumania, from which countries most of them come. They are to be found in the ranks of the Industrial Workers of the World and other extremist organisations, and it is a curious fact that many of the notorious &quot; Gunmen&quot; of New York are Jews. In the larger Trades Unions, where the Jews have got the control, there is a tendency towards revolution. Though the Jewish workers generally are in sympathy with the Bolsheviks, it is thought that they would never attempt any organised rising unless they were sure of the support of the American-born working man.
enemy group.AUSTRIA-H LING AR Y.Hungary. Attention is directed to a Memorandum (G.T. 73S5; circulated by the Home Secretary on the Communist Revolution in Hungary. The Memorandum states that, with the exception of the brief and partial experiment in France in 1848, this is the first time in history that the modern Communist doctrinaire has been put in a position to try his experiments on a machine in full working order. Some account is given of the Communist office-holders, of whom 25 out of 32 are Jews. Bela Kim, &quot; a clever self-advertiser,&quot; is the figurehead; Alpari,: the -Secretary of the Directorate of Five which forms the executive, the brain behind the Government. Among the important subjects dealt Avith are the Constitution, the franchise, control of land, food laws, administration of justice, housing, education, labour, finance, trade, and the Red Army. Notes on these subjects have appeared in previous Western and General Reports. The writer comes to the conclusion that the experiment will fail. The greater part of the population is cowed and submissive, but puts great hope in Allied intervention. The fugitives, workmen, peasants, and soldiers, escaping from Bela Kun&apos;s Government over the Bohemian and Austrian frontiers, seem to have caused a great revulsion of feeling against Communism in these countries. The Commissaries themselves complain that the upper classes have acquired considerable moral power over the workers. Neither universal suffrage nor free institutions form a part of their political programme, and if the proletariat exercises a dictatorship over the bourgeois, the Commissaries exercise a dictatorship over the proletariat. &quot;There is one happy class in Hungary to-day &quot; the Commissaries.According to War Office notes on the military situation (May 31st), the Red Army has concentrated four divisions on the Czech front, and has therefore a considerable superiority. Ammunition, however, is short. The following extract is taken from the Viennese Press (May 30th):  &quot; The military situation of the Red Army has&apos;improved. Army Commander Bohm is asking for eight divisions, or 60,000 men. The active officers and General Staff of the former Austro-Hungarian Army are redistributed the old discipline re-established. The title &quot; Comrade&quot; has been abolished. Budapest is defended by 20,000 men under Town Commander Haubricht. The so-called &quot; Lehin&apos;s Boys,&quot; who formerly threatened Budapest, have accepted the Governments ultimatum and disarmed. The agricultural, financial and industrial situation is so bad that, in spite of military success, the position of the Government is untenable.&quot;The Council of the Allied and Associated Powers have telegraphed to General Franchet d&apos;Esperey to the effect that they formally disapprove of the decision of the Rumanian High Command to march against Budapest (Mr. Balfour, June 2nd).Czechoslovakia.-^-The situation in Prague is again normal. Considerable resentment is expressed against Socialist agitation in general and against M. Sou coup, the Minister of Justice, in particular. The latter&apos;s speech, inciting the mob to plunder, is severely criticised in the Press (Mr. Gosling, May 30th).A Commission, consisting of nine Poles and nine Czechs, has been appointed to discuss the question of Teschen (Mr. Gosling, May 28th).Mr. Gosling has been informed by President Masaryk that the Hungarians have repeatedly crossed the demarcation line into Czech territory, and that, consequently, it is impossible for the Czech army to remain on the defensive. The Press declares that the defeat of Czech troops was caused by the failings of the Italian General hitherto in command. It is understood that he is to be replaced by a French Commander-in-chief (Vienna, June 3rd).Siyria and Carinlhia. According to recent information received from these provinces it is stated that since the occupation of their southern portions by Jugo-Slav troops numerous acts of violence have been- committed against the German population. Cases of personal intimidation, seizure of hostages, sequestration of property are frequent.A Note (W.C.P. 861) has been addressed by the Austrian delegates to the secretariat of the Peace Conference stating that the situation in Carinthia becomes daily more threatening. Fighting is reported to have been resumed between Jugo-Slav troops and the population, and Unterdrauburg has been bombarded.
The Supreme Council of the Allied and Associated Powers has requested the Government at Belgrade to issue immediately explicit instructions to local Jugo-Slav commanders to cease hostile operations and to withdraw their troops behind the frontier line laid down by the Peace Conference (Astoria, June 2nd).GERMANY.The German counter-proposals. The Nauen Service of May 30th gives the text of Germany&apos;s counter-proposals.   (1) Germany is prepared to proceed with disarmament, to abandon compulsory service, to reduce her army to 100,000 men, and to surrender her battleships.   She makes it a condition, however, that she enters immediately into the League of Nations on an equal footing with other members.   (2) She renounces sovereignty over Alsace and Lorraine, but demands a plebiscite.   She is willing to surrend to Poland the greater part of the Province of Posen, to establish Danzig, Konigsberg and Memel as free ports, to grant free navigation of the Danube and special railway conventions.   France is to he provided with coal, especially from the Sarre Valley, until the French mines are in working order.   Predominantly Danish territories of Schleswig are to be restored to Denmark on the basis of a plebiscite. Self-determination is demanded for Germans in Austria and Bohemia.   Germany is ready to hand over her Colonies to the League of Nations provided she is recognised as the mandatory Power.   (3) Germany will make payments up to a maximum of 100 milliard marks in gold 20 milliards to be paid by 1926, the remaining 80 milliards in yearly instalments provided that freedom of economic movement is accorded to her.   (4) The whole of Germany&apos;s economic resources will be placed in the service  of &quot; reconstruction.   The remaining articles provide for the formation of a &quot;world-pool&quot; of all merchant shipping space, the construction of ships for the  Allies  in   German  shipyards, restoration  of Aressels  for   river   navigation in France and Belgium, equal  rights  for all labour,  investigation  by  neutrals into the responsibility for the war.   The German Peace Delegation has issued a comprehensive   Memorandum    giving   additional  details   with  regard  to  these proposals.   This  Memorandum  deals,   inter   alia,   with  the  following points :   (1) Negotiations as to the League of Nations on the basis of the Allies&apos; scheme ; (2) gradual disarmament and the retention of a sufficient force to maintain internal order; (3) establishment of a non-military zone in the West; (4) plebiscite for disputed territories and the protection of minorities.   Eupen cannot be transferred from one sovereignty to another merely for the sake of tin or timber ; (5) the right of Austria to unite with Germany ; (6) Upper Silesia, the German portions of West Prussia, and Danzig must remain German ; (7) dismantlement of Heligoland agreed to ; (8) renunciation of rights and privileges in Riao Chow ; (9) agreements betAveen Allies and Russian States only to be recognised when they are published and no reparation to be made to Russia ; (10) confiscation of German cables, the surrender of German merchant shipping, and liquidation of private property in foreign countries unjustifi-able ; (11) compensation to Italy, Montenegro, Serbia, Rumania, and Poland refused ; (12) refusal to make good direct war costs or to pay for the Army of Occupation; (13) avoidance of unfair competition ; (14) the Kaiser not to be punished.; (15) occupation to last not longer than six months after the signature of the Treaty; (16) Discussion of labour problems by a special Labour Conference.Separatism. (1) The Palatinate. Protests have been made both officially and in the Press against the alleged attempt of the French authorities to create an independent Republic of the Palatinate in union Avith France. General Gerard is accused of arresting the German municipal authorities at Landau (Frankfurter Zeitung, Mav 23rd).(2) The Rhine Province. The German Government has issued a proclamation signed by Scheidemann and the other ministers, stating that according to trustworthy reports there exists &quot; a criminal plan &quot; to proclaim an independent republic of the Rhineland. The document points out that this territory is part of the Prussian State, and that whoever tries to bring about its severance from that State is guilty of high treason, and liable to the punishment provided for that offence.In the Prussian Assembly on May 28th, Herr Herold, speaking for the Centre Party, made a declaration in the Prussian Assembly about the Party&apos;s attitude towards the foundation of an independent Rhine State, united to Germany. In view of the necessity for unity at home and abroad, the Party, he said, is convinced that all classes of the population must Avork with the Government against, particularist efforts coming from Avithin. or from without (Nauen, May 29th).8194-lb B
A statement appears in tlie Press that the Centre Deputies, Herren Kastert and Ivuckhoff, resigned their seats in the Prussian Assembly owing to the discovery of their plans for the severance of the Rhineland from Prussia (Nauen, dune 1st).According to a wireless report from Nauen (June 2nd), semi-official news of June 1st states that on Sunday placards were posted .at Wiesbaden and Mainz announcing the establishment of a Republic of the Rhine. According to the proclamation this Republic will consist of Rhineland, Rhenish Hesse, Rhenish Palatinate and the Principality of Birkenfeld. The seat of the Provisional Govern-ment, which is said to be already in existence, is at Wiesbaden ; ultimately Coblentz is to be the capital. Permission to hold elections for the Constituent Assembly is to be obtained immediately. For the present the State and Communal authorities are to remain in office. The proclamation is signed by three Workmen&apos;s Committees the Rhenish Labour Committee, the Nassau-Rhenish Labour Committee and the Palatinate Labour Committee. No names are mentioned, however. At Coblentz and Cologne the proclamation was not distributed. Only one paper in the occupied district took notice of it and expressed approval. This was the Neuester Anzeiger of Mainz, which is thought to have been bought several weeks ago by the enemy.The whole Rhenish population declares its determination to remain united to the Empire.(3) Hanover. The Vossische Zeitung (May 27th) contains a protest by the Democratic German National and German People/s Parties against the public demonstration on behalf of an independent Hanover, conducted by the German Hanoverian Party.The Future of Mahncdy. Cardiual von Hartmann, the Archbishop of Cologne, has sent to the President of the German Armistice Commission a long letter of protest against the cession of Malmedy and Eupen. The grounds of the protest are principally of historical nature. Since the foundation of the Abbey of Malmedy in the year 650, Malmedy and district have formed part of the Archbishopric of Cologne aud of Germany ; Eupen and district are purely German and, as Tacitus states, were inhabited by Germans in the first century of our era. The present-day character of both is overwhelmingly German, the Cardinal asserts, but should any real doubt still exist as to the true sentiments of the population, he proposes that a secret vote should be taken in which the possibility of undue influence should be excluded (Nauen, May 28th).The Chemical Industry. The following information is taken from the Economic Report sent by the Berlin Foreign Office through Nauen to Madrid.No material change has taken place in the unfavourable situation of the chemical industry. The difficulties arising out of the shortage of coal and raw material continue unabated. In order to relieve&apos; the shortage of fuel, some Avorks have experimentally been adopting coal-tar oil. There are available only totally insufficient amounts of potash and calcium of soda for the use of soap factories and for the manufacture of fatless washing materials. The supply of hydrochloric acid, soda-lye and soda is extremely scanty. The shortage of glycerine prevents the production of important medicines. There is a total lack of the raw materials indispensable for dye factories and a total lack also of refined mineral oils.Russian Relations. Mr. Clive (Stockholm) states that a Press telegram from Viborg (May 27th) contains a rumour emanating from Berne to the effect that secret negotiations, conducted by Parvus, are proceeding betAveen the Germans and the Russian Bolsheviks. In the event of Germany refusing to sign the peace a big scheme is said to be contemplated for organising Bolshevism in most European countries.An article by Walter Lessing in the Vossische Zeitung (May 21st) shows the Nationalist attitude tOAvards a rapprochement Avith Russia :-&quot; From&apos; this point of view the development of our relations Avith the East must be considered, and they must not be allowed to deviate from their object, a permanent friendship Avith Russia. Our chief task, begins after the conclusion of peace. Let us learn from our chief enemy, England, that persistency in the pursuit of an object, and do not Jet us forget that England is not only our enemy, but also that of Russia. This Peace Treaty is a mockery of the biological laAV of the movement of peoples, which is at the root of the .&apos;world. A Caucasus controlled by England, a Baltic controlled by England, the Dardanelles under the control of the League of Nations, i.e., England, con be borne ten times less easily by Russia than by Germany. And, therefore, Russia, too, needs Germany&apos;s friendship.&quot;
NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.Bolshevism. The Home Office Weekly Report on Revolutionary Movements Abroad iG.T. 7308) describes the situation in Argentina as follows : &quot;Bolshevism is certainly growing, and the Government, which probably lacks the power to suppress a serious outbreak, is pandering to the working man in order to stave off the evil day. The Anarchist centre in Buenos Aires is reported to be sending Bolshevik propaganda to the United States via Mexico, and a Bolshevik publication, the Red Flag, has appeared. There is some evidence that German influence and German money are behind the strikes Throughout South America there is a tendency for all the extremists to join in a common hatred of the United States, on the ground that they exploit the South American people for their own profit.&quot;BALTIC PROVINCES.Allied Policy. The Allied Powers have handed to the German Armistice Commission at Spa a Note (vide W.C.P. 847), according to which German troops in Latvia are to remain in the country behind a given line. For the present General von der Goltz cau retain his command on condition (1) that he receives from his Government instructions such.as would lead to the establishment of a coalition Government representing all the Lettish Socialist Parties; (2) that all arms be returned to the Lettish troops ; (3) that no hindrance be put in the way of a mobility-sation of the Lettish forces ; (4) tbat full freedom be assured to the same Government in the performance of their duties.In addition, the following policy with regard to the Baltic States has been sanctioned : (1) An Allied Military Mission under General Gough is to be organised with headquarters at Libau for the purpose of advising the Governments of Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania on organisation, equipment, and the training of local and volunteer forces, and generally on the best means of defence against the Bolsheviks ; (2) volunteer forces are to be raised in Scandinavia and Finland ; (3) food supplies, clothing, arms, and munitions are to be provided by the Allies ; (4) political and economic missions are to discover what collateral securities can be obtained locally to cover credits (Admiralty Weekly Appreciation, No. 24).Military Situation.  (1) The Advance on Petrograd. According to the Esthonian Military Report of -May SOth, the Bolsheviks launched a counter-offensive, which led to violent lighting west and south-west of Gratchina. One complete Bolshevik regiment surrendered to the Northern Corps.(2) Pskov Front. Detachments of the Northern Corps entered Pskov on May 29th. The advance has continued north-west to Sprougi-Bielaia on the Pskov-Petrograd railway.(3) Southern Esthonian Front.-On May 27th&apos;Mr. Bosanquet (Reval) reported that Volmar had been captured by the Esthonians, who were advancing on Wenden. The Bolsheviks have retreated to positions south of Marienburg (Moscow, May SOth). On May 30th Mr. Bosanquet reported that Esthonian troops had established, touch with Lettish detachments advancing from Riga.(4) Livonian Front. Lettish and Bait forces have reached the line Neubad-Hinzenburg (west of Riga). Only about 4,000 Germans are at the front, and these are situated south of the Mitau-Jakobstadt railway. Of the Lettish forces 2,300 are on the River Aa, 300 in Riga, and 300 in Schlok. Of the Bait Landwehr 6,000 are at the front or in Riga (Mr. Grant W7atson, May 28th).(5) Courland. Mr. Grant Watson has been informed that there are 45,000 German troops under arms in Courland.Supplies. Continued appeals are being made for the supply of arms &quot;and equip-ment for the Northern Corps, and of food for the population of the captured districts (Mr. Bosanquet, May 27th and 28th). The Russian Minister at Stockholm has drawn Mr. Clive&apos;s attention to the necessity of preparing a scheme for the rationing of Petrograd in the event of its early capture.
sLUXEMBURG.The League of Nations. A note (W.C.P. 868), dated May 12th, has been received &quot;from the Government of the Grand Duchy requesting that Luxemburg may be included as an original member in the League of Nations.MEXICO.Revolutionary Activities. It is believed that the city of Oaxaca, with which all communication is interrupted, has been captured by the revolutionaries. The latter have occupied Misantla in the State of Veru Cruz and have caused considerable damage to railways. Increased revolutionary activity is reported from many parts of the country.A certain section of the Press unrestrainedly accuses Carranza&apos;s Government of using corrupt methods and sacrificing the interests of the people.Robles Dominguez has promised to protect British and American subjects.General Obregon, who defeated Villa in 1916, has been charged by Carranza with the task of conducting the campaign against the revolutionaries (Mr. Cummins, May 30th and 31st, and June 2nd).With regard to the request of the Mexican Government that its troops might lie allowed to pass through Onited States territory, the State Department at Washington has informed Mr. Barclay that under existing conditions the United States Government has no intention of granting such permission.Relations with Great Britain. According to information given to Mr. Cummins by Senior Covarrubias, Carranza has decided to restore diplomatic relations with Great Britain in order to preclude the necessity of dealing with British and European interests through the United States. By this policy Carranza intends to demonstrate that he refuses all recognition of the Monroe Doctrine.&apos; SPAIN.The Elections. There is widespread indignation in the Press as to the method in which the election campaign is being conducted. All scruples have gone by the board and corruption is rife (Tribwna, 16th). Election intelligence in papers of the Left, including. reports of party meetings, especially the meeting of Socialists and Republicans held in Madrid on May 18th, is riddled with blanks (Mundo, Socialista, 18th; Pais, Liberal, FLercddo de Madrid, 19th; Tribuna, 19th and 20th), and an election address by Senor Lerroux at Saragossa is mutilated (Sol, 20th). Even the modest concession prohibiting the Censors from restricting the election propaganda is only granted after the election campaign has been in progress for a week (Mundo, 19th). Political opponents are prosecuted and imprisoned by the local judges (Imparcicd, 19th), and Mayors and Town Councils have been suspended in districts Avhere the prospects of Government candidates are doubtful, despite&apos; the fact that prior to the last general elections the appointment of Mayors by the Crown was abolished (idem).Senor Maura&apos;s decision to continue the suspension of the constitutional guarantees, which places candidates and electors at the mercy of the Government, is especially condemned.SWEDEN.Socialists and Peace. The Swedish Social Democratic Party, at a meeting held on May 27th, adopted the following resolution : Swedish Socialists, though belonging to a neutral country, consider it their duty to plead for the principles proclaimed by the &quot; Internationa] &quot; as the foundation for a durable peace. These principles have scarcely received their due, and in several points have been totally disregarded in the terms of the Peace Treaty, which is marked by a spirit of Imperialism. While-it is admitted that just compensation must be made within the limits of possibility for the damage done to Belgium and Northern France, it is exceeding the bounds of justice to impose an indemnity so unlimited and so immeasurably oppressive that the vanquished are doomed to serfdom under their conquerors. It is also unjust that indisputably German territory should, against wishes of the population, be transferred. to newly established neighbouring States.   Swedish Socialists still hope
tbat..niodifieations in terms may be made at tbe last moment. Any peace which diverges from strict justice bears within it the seed of new conflicts. Seeing that the entire human race is interested in securing a durable peace, the Swedish Social democrats consider themselves entitled to address from a neutral country an earnest appeal to the Peace Conference to let the peace be marked by magnanimity and justice which, will ensure its durability.The Socialists and Russia. The Politiken (June 2nd) publishes an appeal addressed by the Swedish Extreme Socialists to the Norwegian Social Democratic Party proposing that the two parties should jointly apply to : (.1) the Communistic and Socialist Parties in France, Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, America, Italy, Austria, Bohemia and Spain ; (2) the Trades Unions, and (3) tbe Transport Workers and Seamerfs Unions in those countries, with proposals to blockade all countries (Finland, Estland, Lettland, Poland, Czecho-Slovakia, Russian Arctic Coast, Black Sea Coast, and KoltchalFs territory in Siberia) which are attacking Soviet Russia. The blockade is to comprise the transport of troops, war material, foodstuffs, industrial goods and products both by sea and land whether under war flag or not. The Politiken also publishes a reply from the Norwegian Workmen&apos;s Party which is in the affirmative (Mr. Clive, June 3rd).Meeting of Scandinavian Ministers. The Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers met at Stockholm between May 26th and 28th at the invitation of the Swedish Government. An official communique on their deliberations has been issued in the Swedish Press. Reciprocal information was given with regard to changes in the commercial and political situation in the three countries since the last meeting. The following questions were discussed : entry into the Feague of Nations, economic and commercial co-operation, compensation for losses sustained in maritime warfare, credits granted to foreign countries during the war, &amp;c. It was agreed to treat these subjects in collaboration (Mr. Clive, May 30th).Reimposilion of the Blockade. In reply to the inquiry (vide Report No. 120, page 2) as to the attitude which would be adopted by neutrals in the event of the blockade being resumed against Germany, the Swedish Government has sent Mr. Clive the following Note, Similar Notes have been presented by tbe Finish and Norwegian Governments : &quot; The Swedish Government considers that in deciding to sever all commercial relations with Germany it would be departing from the attitude adopted and maintained by Sweden towards belligerents during the whole course of the war.&quot; It would point out that the commercial arrangement concluded with the Associated Governments expressly indicates that a complete rupture of commercial relations with Germany will not, be forced upon Sweden since the arrangement-admits, on the contrary, the possibility of such relations within defined limits.&quot;The Swedish Government would further point out that both from the practical and technical standpoint such a decision would have most serious inconveniences for the economic life of the country.&quot; The associated representatives mention in their note that fresh measures may eventually have to be taken against Germany. Resumption of the blockade is under-stood to be among these measures. It is clear, however, that this can be rendered effective without the co-operation of Sweden, and it would seem therefore that the Associated Governments can attain their object independently of any measures taken by the Swedish Government.&quot; Under the circumstances the Swedish Government hopes that the Associated Governmentswillnotdeem.it necessary to insist on their demand for a declaration .as asked for, and that they will not in consequence have recourse to measures which would cause inconvenience to Swedish import trade.&quot;Bolshevism. According to the Weekly Review of the Progress of Revolutionary Movements Abroad (G.T. 7368) issued by the Home Office, the actual position of Bolshevism in Sweden may be described as follows : In some of the Northern Swedish provinces the majority of Avorkmen are Bolshevik. In Westnorrland the Bolsheviks are in an absolute majority. In Stockholm they are also very active and have some influential leaders.Both in Westnorrlancl and Stockholm they are in close touch with Moscow, probably through Finland.Sl 9-1-16 0
SWITZERLAND.Jieimposilion of the Blockade. The Swiss Government lias replied to the identic Note presented by the Allied Governments on May 19th (vide Report No. 120, page 2) to the following effect  : &quot; Export restrictions arising out of the control of the Societe Suisse de Surveillance Economique still exist almost to the same extent as before although the Federal Council has in a recent Note asked for their statutory suppression. During the whole period of hostilities the right of the Societe Suisse de Surveillance Economique to import goods from Germany has never been questioned and the engagement which Switzerland is ashed to assume would therefore go beyond any restriction imposed during the war, involving, as it would, the rupture of all economic relations with Germany. The Federal Council considers itself still bound by its declaration of neutrality of August 4th, 1914, and feels obliged to conform to the line of conduct which it has pursued during the present war. The engagement which it is asked to take aj)pears incompatible with the policy of neutrality observed up to the present ami from which the Federal Council does not wish to depart in the final phase of the war &quot; (Loixl Acton, may 30th).Economic Agreement with Germany.
