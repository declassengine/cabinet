The Buda-Pest Soviet Government seems at present to be supported onSy by a small minority, and to depend for its existence upon success in reconciling national sentiment with the creed of the Bolshevik inter-nationalists. The Government is reported to be opposed to the bloody methods which gave the Bolshevik minority their powers over the majority in Russia.Germany (page A).   There is still much conflict of opinion about whether Bolshevism is a real danger or a force used deliberately by Germany to obtain better peace terms. The balance of evidence supports the former view. Disturbances are reported in various parts of the country.   [See also under Baltic- Provinces.]The Soviet Government in Bavaria has beeu overthrown.Neutral Countries.Bcdtic Provinces (page 7). In a report to the Supreme War Council the Military Representatives arrive at the conclusion that Germany is trying to re-establish her power aud influence in the Baltic States. Much evidence has been received, from other sources in support of this view.Finland (page 7). The reported views of General Mannerheim are of special interest.Norway (page 8). There is further evidence of the forgery of British paper money in Russia for propaganda purposes.Switzerland (page 9). The Swiss Government now favours the inclusion of Vorarlberg in the Federation, subject to decision by the Peace Conference.G. G. A.April 16th, 1919.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Bolshevism. Special attention is drawn to a Memorandum (G.T. 70SG), written by General Halving, the chief British military delegate at Spa. After tracing the causes and effects of Bolshevism, the Memorandum slates that the Allies &quot; are still ranging themselves together against a danger that is past (i.e., Germany) in the effort, not only to secure a lasting peace with the enemies against whom they have been fighting, but also to reduce the political, economic and commercial stability of those enemies. The\&apos; do not appear to recognise that one war is over, and that they must at once get busy to prepare to act victoriously against the next; which means that they must rearrange their former forces and create an alliance with any people, in or out of Europe, who are prepared to join hands with them to defeat the international power of Bolshevism .... Germany is at present engaged in a great struggle against Bolshevism,&quot; which, unless the situation is relieved, &quot; will destroy any Government in Germany which can have the power of carrying out terms of peace or of maintaining order within its borders.&quot; General flaking is convinced that, &quot;in order to save not only Germany, but also France and England and later on America, from Bolshevism, the Allies must immediately relax the conditions of the armistice, and do this in no half-hearted way.&quot; While the various interests in the State are seeking safeguards, which involve lengthy conferences, &quot; the great stormclouds of Bolshevism are daily rolling closer from East to West, and protection against the menace is being neglected.&quot; The Memorandum goes on to say that &quot; if it is accepted that Bolshevism is an international force which knows no country and can thrive in any, it is surely necessary for us to create at the earliest possible moment an international force to repel it ... . Amongst the nations who have been engaged in the recent struggle there are two close friends (Great Britain and the United States) and two deadly enemies (France and Germany) . . . . Our efforts at present should be directed towards cementing the existing Anglo-American friendship, which constitutes the greatest economic and military power in the world, and not to attempt to reduce the enmity between France and Germany .... If the latter prevents the former from joining whole-heartedly in the steps that must be taken to meet this danger (Bolshevism), she must be left out of the calculation .... The first step to be taken is to strengthen Germany in every possible way so that she can fight Bolshevism in her own country and on her frontiers . . . . Germany can only be strengthened by giving her people food and work . . . . If the Anglo-Saxon race would tell Germany to-morrow that the blockade is to be completely removed in three days, she would rise from her present apathy and despair, she would at once commence far more energetic measures to defeat Bolshevism, and she would raise a great bulwark against this terrible evil to protect Western Europe and thus restore a real peace in the world.&quot;Extracts from a Report circulated by the Home Secretary (G.T. 7091) are given in an Appendix to this Report.This subject is also dealt with under &quot; Japan (Revolt in Corea),&quot; &quot; Austria-Hungary,&quot; &quot; Germanv,&quot; &quot; Baltic Provinces,&quot; &quot; Finland,&quot; &quot; Norway (Forged Notes),&quot; and &quot;Sweden.&quot;Food Supplies for Germany. Proposals are under consideration for the removal of restrictions, as imposed by separate agreements, on the exportation of foodstuffs for human consumption from Northern Neutrals into Germany (Astoria, April 10th).Relaxation of Trade Restrictions. The French military authorities have with-drawn their objection to the resumption of trade with Lettland and Lithuania. It has been agreed that a notice should be published in the Press announcing resumption as from April 14th (Astoria, April 11th).Trade with Eastern Europe. A Memorandum (G.T. 7112)has been issued by the Board of Trade on the advisability of affording credits under the support of the British Government for the purpose of facilitating trade with the countries of Eastern Europe.
ALLIED  GROUP.CHINA.Tsing-tao. The Japanese Government has informed their representative at Peking that enemy subjects in Tsing-tao are to be treated exactly the same as prisoners of war in Japan (Sir J. Jordan, April 11th).The Shantung Provincial Assembly and other influential bodies have made urgent representations that all railway privileges in the province should be restored direct to China by Germany (April 6th).Importation of Anns and Ammunition. -The Allied and United States Ministers have represented that the export of arms and ammunition into China should be stopped until there is a Chinese Government whose authority is recognised throughout the country (Sir J. Jordan, April Sth).Repatriation of Missionaries. The United States State Department have represented the desirability of deporting only those missionaries Avho have supported enemy Powers perniciously.FRANCE.Press Articles. Lord Derby on April Oth (received 12th) called attention to an article in the Matin strongly criticising the attitude of Great Britain and President Wilson towards the claims of France. On March 28th and 30th M. Geraud took the same line in the Echo (D.R. F.P.). On April. 11th Lord Derby reported that the Echo supported the Morning Post announcement that Foch, Petain and Joffre had reported to the President of the Council demanding the occupation of the left bank of the Rhine as the only way to ensure execution of the peace terms by Germany.ITALY.Press Campaign against England. Mr. Erskine on April 13th reported the substance of hostile articles against England published in various papers.Sympathetic Strike in Rome.--A 24-hour strike was proclaimed on April 10th to commemorate the deaths of Spartacists, including Liebkuecht (Mr. Erskine).Coed Situation. Sir P. Rodd was informed on April 10th of the steps taken to supplement the shipping already under Italian control in order to deal with the situation.JAPAN.Revolt in Corea. Mr. Alston on April 11th reported, the spread eastwards of the revolt in Corea, shown by evidence to be engineered by well-organised Bolsheviks, and the military measures taken by Japan for its suppression. &quot;Earl A. Paik, Acviug President of the Korean National Association,&quot; telegraphed from San Fiancisco on April 14th giving the substance of a telegram from an agent in Shanghai which contained details of events, and strongly supported the revolutionaries.SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Montenegro. Doubt has arisen whether General Franchet d&apos;Esperey&apos;s orders about evacuation by Italians and Serbs have been obeyed (Foreign Office to Lord Derby, April 13th).UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Attitude towards Great Britain. Lord Reading on April Sth and 11th called attention to a critical attitude in sections of the Press and elsewhere towards Great Britain.   The subjects referred.to are repatriation of Amercian troops in British
vessels, American troops in North Russia, and alleged use of censorship to secure secret information about trade.GoLLon Export Corporation. A decision has been come to at a conference at Memphis to form a cotton export corporation (Lord Reading, April 11 th).ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Hungary. The counter-proposals of the Hungarian Government to General Smuts&apos; draft agreement were published in the Hungarian Wireless Reports of last week. While the Government appeared willing to accept the greater part of the agreement, it demanded the withdrawal of the Rumanian troops east of the River Maros. General Smuts found himself unable to accede to this demand and negotia-tions were consequently broken off.General Smuts in his Report (W.G.P. 491) considers that the present situation was precipitated by (1) the publication of the alleged intention of the Entente Governments to hand over to the Ozecho-Slovaks the whole Danubian fleet between Pressburg&apos; and Baja, (2) the decision of the Paris Conference to allow the Rumanians to advance their line in Trans3dvania and the belief that this line represented the final political frontier.The present Government is said to be supported by some 20 per cent, of the Budapest population,\while its authority in the provinces is negligible. Though advocating a policy of complete communism, it differs from the Russian Soviet Government in that (1) it is bound to adopt at least the semblance of a Nationalist policy, (2) it is determined to refrain, if possible, from bloodshed. Unless, however, the economic situation is quickly relieved, there is every prospect of Samuelli, an avowed terrorist, gaining supreme control.According to wireless reports from Budapest, the Government has been busying itself during the past week with questions of educational &quot; reform.&quot;Crowds of volunteers, including Italians, Russians and Rumanians, are stated to be joining the Red Army (Budapest, April 10th).A Budapest report states that Serbian units are fraternising with Hungarian, revolutionaries at Szeged and that a mutinous spirit has broken out. Lord Acton has been informed by the Serbian Minister at Berne that there is no truth in these reports,, which have probably been published in consequence of the Serbian Governments refusal to receive an official emissary from Budapest.Czeclio-Slovakia.--President Masaryk has confirmed Mr. Gosling&apos;s information with regard to the excesses committed by Czecho-Slovak troops in Troppau (vide Report No 112, page 6), and has promised to remedy the situation. He anticipates that the decision of the Peace Conference to include German-Bohemia in the Republic will lead to disturbances and has instructed the Minister of Defence to take measures accordingly (Mr. Gosling, April 12th).GERMANY.Political Situation, (.1) General. Sir W. Townley has received two divergent views of the present situation in Germany. One informant, who has recently travelled through Germany, believes that Bolshevism is being used to gain mor^ favourable terms from the Allies. On the other hand, the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs states that the situation is daily growing worse and anticipates that the present Government will be superseded by Herr Haase and the Independent Socialists.Lord Acton learns from a member of the Bavarian Legation at Berne that the opinion prevails in Germany that the Entente will support the Scheidemann Govern-meut as one of the contracting parties to the peace settlement and that therefore all the elements of opposition to that Government are united to procure its fall before the
commencement of peace negotiations. Public opinion in Bavaria, Wurtemburg, and Baden is stated to be in favour of separate peace negotiations with a view to a uuion of South Germany and German Austria to the exclusion of Prussia.[The following notes are derived from German Wireless Reports, the dates of -which are given in brackets.](2) Bavaria. The Soviet Government was proclaimed at Wiirzburg, Regensburg, Anspach, Passau, Augsburg, Hof, and Schweinfurth. On the other hand, it was opposed by the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils in Nuremburg, and by the Peasants&apos; council of Central Franconin, which supported Herr Hoffmaim&apos;s Government at Bamberg. Opposition steadily increased in Northern Bavaria. The Bam berg-Government issued the following proclamation&apos;: The news that the Socialist Government of Prime Minister Hoffmann had resigned is untrue. Hoffmann, who was elected unanimously by the Bavarian Assembly, has come to Bamberg. This Govern-ment alone possesses the supreme power in Bavaria. They alone are in a position to issue decrees and orders.&quot; A further decree appealed to the people to support the Government in carrying out measures of socialistic reform by constitutional methods (April 9th). The Soviet Government was overthrown at Wiirzburg and strikes ended at Nuremburg (April 10th). The Peasants resolved to starve out Munich. Their leader, Dr. Heini, protested against the Munich Governments interference with the Peasants&apos; Savings Bank. Munich and Augsburg were cut off from their food supply. A new Central Communist Council was set up in Munich (April 11th). Augsburg, Schweinfurth, Aschaffenbiirg, and Regensburg were won back, with the result that the whole of Northern Bavaria now recognised Herr Hoffmann&apos;s Government (April 12th). The Munich garrison revolted against the Central Council of Munich and establishment of military dictatorship in support of the Bamberg Government (April 13th).The following facts with regard to the Communist leaders are of interest. Dr. Levien is in the advanced stage of a repulsive disease. Dr. Lipp has been twice confined in a lunatic asylum. Dr. Rotenfelder escaped in 1913 from Dr. Lindenburg&apos;s clinic of psychiatry at Cologne.(3) Berlin.  On April 8th a large meeting of representatives of the Workmen&apos;s Councils belonging to the Majority Socialists passed a unanimous resolution con-demning the efforts of the Independent Socialists and Communists to drive Berlin workmen into a general strike (April 10th).(4) Hanover. Minor disturbances due to Spartacists have occurred (April 12th).(5) Ruhr District.- Street fighting has taken place at Muhlheim. Strikers demand the release of political prisoners and the disbandmeut of the Volunteer Corps. A state of siege has been proclaimed at Dusseldorf and Fssen (April 9th). herr Bauer arrived in Essen to effect a settlement by negotiation, and as a result of their failure to meet him. members of the Committee of Nine were arrested (April 10th). Latest reports (April 13th) state that there is a strong movement in favour of a return to work.(6) Saxony. Strikes have occurred in the mining districts of Lugau, Oelsnit and Zwickau (April Oth and 10th). Magdeburg has been occupied by Herr Noske&apos;s troops (April 10th). Herr Neuring, the Minister of War, was murdered during disturbances at Dresden, as a result of which the Saxon Government has proclaimed a state of siege (April 13th).(7) Brunswick. Strikes commenced on April 9th,&quot;under the auspices of ITerr Eichhorn. War was declared on capitalism and militarism and the strikers&apos; demands included the abolition of the Assembly, an alliance with Russia, and the arming of the proletariat (April 10th).(8) Stuttgart. Order has been restored (April 11th).(9) Danzig. The economic railway strike in Danzig has assumed a political character, and it has been necessary to proclaim a state of siege. After negotiations with the &quot;Imperial&quot; Commissary, August Winnig, the general strike ceased on April 12th, and the state of siege was provisionally removed.Bolshevism. His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for War has circulated an Interim Report (G.T. 7092) by an officer recently returned from Berlin on the results of an investigation into the influence and growth of Bolshevism in Germany.   The Report7786-8!) b
states that, &quot; investigation into official documents goes to prove that Bolshevik activity is steadily on the increase throughout the country; agents are becoming more numerous and more open in their methods, and, further, a steady stream of forged notes are pouring into the country.&quot; The Government is handicapped by the abolition of the secret police and by the distrust of the smaller police officials. &quot; Conversation with individual Germans, of whatever class and station, all go to confirm the opinion that the danger of Germany embracing Bolshevism is both real and imminent.&quot; This is ascribed to the starving condition of the people. The general cry is, &quot; Things cannot possibly be worse than they are now, and any change must be a change for the better.&quot; Even the richer classes are stated to show signs of wavering. The permanent officials, most of whom have been retained by the present Government, arc disheartened by their uncertainty as to the future ; the industrial classes think that by pandering to the Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Councils they may save their businesses, while the whole of the richer and upper classes are convinced that the Entente is determined to annihilate Germany and &quot; are beginning almost to resign themselves to a Bolshevised Germany in the near future.&quot;Unemployment. The Soziale Praxis (March 13th) publishes an article containing statistics of the increase of unemployment at the beginning of February, as compared with the corresponding period of January.&quot;Strikes and unrest in the labour world were partly responsible, but, on the other hand, many workers had been unavoidably discharged, especially from the iron industry, and the spinning, metal and building trades, as a result of the shortage of coal and ores, and also of transport,On the other hand, opportunities for work abound in the broAvn-coal mines and on the land, where labour is urgently needed. The men, however, steadily refuse to accept such offers of employment and prefer to draw their out-of-work allowance, while the women are equally firm in their refusal to enter domestic service.The number of unemployed in Germany at the beginning of January was 500,000, but early in February it had risen to 900,000. In Westphalia the number was over 16,000, in the Rhine Province almost 117,000, in Saxony over 163,000. In the occupied zone, however, a decrease in the number of unemployed was observed. On January 9th for Coblenz the figures were 1,768, in Cologne 31,453, Treves 3,319, and Aix-la-Chapelle 13,261; but by january 29th they had become for Coblenz 1,370, Cologne 27,005, Treves 2,772, and Aix-la-Chapelle 8,78S.Herr Schiffers Resignation.-Plerr Schiffer has sent in his resignation as Minister of Finance owing to insuperable differences of opinion on the subject of the Budget (Nauen, April 12th).Congress of Councils. The Second Congress of Councils opened in Berlin on April 8th. The strength of the parties was as follows : Majority Socialists, 188 ; Independent Socialists, 55 ; German-Austrian representatives, 9 ; Soldiers&apos; Party, 21; Democrats, 12 ; Communists, 1. The Afajority Socialist Herr Hausschild (Cassel) Avas elected President. Herr Leinart opened with a speech protesting against &quot; Imperial conquerors &quot; taking the place of the Junkers as oppressors of the people. Resolutions have been passed demanding the establishment of a National Guard on the basis of universal service, the abolition of all decoration and rank, the institution of Production Councils for every trade and Chambers of Labour for every Anllage, and condemning the murder of Herr Neuring. A proposal to establish a National Soldiers&apos; Council to Avatch Herr Noske avus rejected. Dissensions broke out betAAreen the Majority and Independent Socialists chiefly on the question of the strikes. (Nauen, April 9th to 14th.)The Peace. The Prussian Assembly has appealed to the State Government to use their influence with the Weimar Government in order to persuade them to accept no peace which does not grant the following demands :-(1) A real &quot;peace of understanding.&quot;(2) No deviation from Wilson&apos;s points and particularly no surrender of german territory. (3) Raising of the Blockade. (4) Immediate release of prisoners.(5) Immediate departure of Allies from occupied territories.(Nauen, April 12th).
NEUTRAL GROUP.BALTIC PROVINCES.Military Situation. Tbe usual fighting has taken place in the Narva, Pskov and Marienburg areas, but the general situation remains unchanged. No further news has been received about the reported Bolshevik offensive in the direction of Shlok (west of Riga).German Influence. The Military Representatives of the Supreme War Council have published their conclusions with regard to the existing situation in the Baltic States (W.C.P. 518, S.W.C. 394). They agree &quot; that Germany is trying by all means to re-establish her power and influence in the Baltic States,&quot; and make proposals for counteracting German aggression.His Majesty&apos;s representative at Reval reports that Germany has recognised the Esthonian State.Colonel Tallents, who has recently returned from the Baltic, makes it clear in his report that Libau and Lithuania are dominated by the Germans, wdiile Esthonia is still in serious danger from the Bolshevik invasion. The establishment of a British mission for the Baltic States, with branches at Reval, Libau and Kovno is recom-mended (Mr. Balfour, April 12th).Food Supplies. 20,000 tons of flour are expected to reach Libau shortly (Sir C. Marling, April 9th).BOLIVIA.The Tacna-Ariea Question. The President of the Republic and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have been officially informed that under no circumstances will Peru entertain proposals for the cession of Tacna and Arica to Bolivia (Mr. Haggard, April Sth).FINLAND.British Military Mission Proposed. In the course of a confidential conversation, Mr. Bell gathered from General Mannerheim that the latter considered that for purpose of counteracting the effects of German influence, it would be extremely useful if a British Military Mission could be sent to Finland.Mr. Bell received the impression that General Mannerheim would gladly appreciate it if an invitation could be extended to him to proceed to England for the purpose of discussing the Finnish question generally.Finland and Russia. Tchitcherin, in a message to the Finnish Foreign Minister, states that the Russian Government, having emphatically declared in their Note of February 14th, 1919, that it recognised the independence of Finland and had no aggressive designs against her, and was all the more surprised at the continued military preparations on the part of Finland and the hostile acts committed by Finnish :troops against the Russian Soviet Republic.Dr. Pfeiffer (Central Party), speaking in the National Assembly, said that he voiced the ideas of the whole Assembly when lie protested that three conditions were (1) necessary before peace was signed, namely, the release of occupied territory, the release of prisoners and the removal of the Blockade. He emphasised the need for maintaining the inviolability of German soil, and also claimed the retention of the colonies and Germany&apos;s inclusion in the League of Nations. Failing this Germany might refuse to sign a peace.Poland. The following announcement is made in a wireless message from Posen: &quot; Further acts of violence committed by the German Government against &quot;the Polish population beyond the line of demarcation have decided the Polish Government to take reprisals. They have ordered a number of prominent Germans to be interned. The authorities have appealed to the population not to take the law into their own hands.
While protesting also against the support openly given in Finland to counter-revolutionary elements, which beyond the frontier are attempting to overthrow the Soviet regime, the Russian Government sees nothing to prevent the establishment of normal and peaceful relations between Finland and Russia. The Russian Commissary for Foreign Affairs therefore ashs the Finnish Foreign Minister whether it is not possible to begin an exchange of views as to the best means to be adopted with a view to attaining this object.MEXICO.Death of Zapatetas. A report emanating from the Mexican Government that Zapatetas, the revolutionary chief, has been killed by Federal troops is believed to .be true.    Zapatetas   has  conducted war against  eight  successive  Governments (Mr. Cummins, April 11th).NORWAY.German Shipping. Responsibility for taking over German shipping in Norwegian waters is being assumed by the United States. The Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs has received unofficial confirmation from the German Minister of the Agreement between Germany and the Allies with regard to the surrender of German shipping,, and in view of such agreement is prepared to waive Norway&apos;s claim to prior right (vide Report No. 114, page 9) (Sir M. Findlay, April Sth).Forged Notes. Information has been received that large quantities of forged British one-pound notes and-Norwegian one-crown notes are being; exported from Russia to propaganda agents for use in these countries. A police warning has been issued to Norwegian bankers (Sir M. Findlay, April 12th).The Language Question. A Government crisis has almost been occasioned on account of a resolution modifying the orthography of the Norwegian language. Two counter-proposals, tantamount to a want of confidence, were defeated by the Govern-ment by 10 votes and by the Presidents casting vote respectively. The Conservative leaders appear to have been prepared to form a Government inthe event of success (Sir M. Findlay, April 9th).SPAIN.The New Government. Senor Maura has formed a new Government composed as follows : Prime Minister      -----   Senor Maura.Foreign Affairs       - - - -      ,,    Hontoria.Finance     - - - - - ,,    La Cierva.Interior   - - - . -      ,,    Goiecoechea.Public Works        - - - - -      ,,    Ossorio.Instruction - - - -      ,,    Silio.Justice      - -        - - - - -   Viscount Matamala.Marine    -----   General Mirando.Sir A. Hardinge learns that the downfall of the Romanones Government was due to military elements which are dissatisfied with its timorous policy in dealing with the recent riots. The new Government is strongly Conservative, though Sehor Hontoria, avIio is an expert on Morocco and very pro-English, is a Romanonist Liberal.The Cortina Agreement. Count Romanones has submitted to Sir A. Hardinge a proposal for the withdrawal of all his commercial demands in return for Great Britain&apos;s withdrawal of the denunciation of the Cortina Agreement (vide Report No. 105, page 9)..SAVEDEN.Frame and the Soviet Government. A communication from the French Legation has appeared in the Swedish Press to the effect that France refuses to recognise the-
atitlibrity of the Russian Soviet Government to grant concessions to foreign capitalists for the building of railways and tbe right to use canals, ports, forests, &amp;c. The French Minister has informed the Swedish Government of this by drawing its attention to the risks run by Swedes who may possibly acquire concessions from the Bolsheviks, as the French Government refuses to recognise their validity. On April oth the Politiken published an abusive criticism of this communique (Mr. Clive April 9th).SWITZERLAND.Vorarlberg. According to information given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the French Minister at Berne the Swiss Government has decided no longer to oppose the incorporation of Vorarlberg in the Confederation. An increase in the German and Catholic element, of the population, which was the cause of the Govern-ment&apos;s opposition, is preferred to the prolongation of the Swiss frontier with Germany, which would ensue if Vorarlberg carried out her alternative proposal for incorporation with Wurtemburg. The Federal Council is expected to accept the Vorarlberg plebiscite in favour of union &quot;with Switzerland and to submit the decision for ratification by the Peace Conference (Lord Acton, April 11th).The Government is in favour of the neutralisation of the Tyrol, so as to form a buffer State between Germany and Italy (Lord Acton, April 14th).Relations with Hungary. The Hungarian Minister at Berne has informed the United States Minister that the new Hungarian Government disavows all intention of starting a revolutionary movement in Switzerland and wishes to maintain friendly relations with the Swiss Government (Lord Acton, April 10th).PEACE DISCUSSIONS.Handbooks prepared in the Historical Section of the Foreign Office.

APPENDIXtoWestern and General Report No. 115.BOLSHEVISM   ABROAD.Extracts from a Report (G.T. 7001) issued by the Home Secretary.Thougli definite information about the revolutions in Hungary and Bavaria is still wanting, there seems reason for doubt as to whether the new Governments are really Bolshevik at all and are not bogeys set up for the express purpose of frightening the Allies into conceding better terms. The Bolshevik creed knows no frontiers and no patriotism, and yet Count Karolyi resigned on a question of the national frontier, and the new &quot; Bolshevik &quot; Government assumed office on a question of pure patriotism. The whole of the drama and the Press notices were too obviously &quot; staged &quot; to carry conviction, and the behaviour of the new proletariat Government appears far too virtuous to be real.Bolshevism in Russia is running its course, and, while there is no reason to doubt that the German Government is genuinely concerned at the spread of Spartacism, it is also still trying to spread, the poison in Allied countries. Sporadic outbreaks of the disease are reported from various British possessions, but it appears now to be clear that the disturbances in Egypt were purely nationalist and not Bolshevik in origin. It is beginning to seem likely that Bolshevism of the Russian type may pass like the disease of Communism in Paris in 1871.France. The acquittal of Villain, the assassin of Jaiires, following the condemnation of Cottin, who attempted the life of M. Clemenceau, has been most unfortunate at the present juncture. The enemies of M. Clemencean and the extreme Socialists alike are furious at what they call the insult flung by a bourgeois jury at the proletariat. Anatole, Prance, writes: &quot;This verdict puts you beyond the pale of the law.   Workers, be on your guard.&quot;The police are dealing firmly with Bolshevik propagandists.In the 5th Army Area there is unrest among the troops. &quot; L&apos;Internationale &quot; has been sung by French soldiers in public, and soldiers have been heard to say that they were out for revolution. The long delays of the Conference in Paris are producing a feeling of uneasiness about the future, but unless the Confederation Generale du Travail declares for a general strike (which is considered very unlikely) no active disturbance appears to be imminent.Belgium. M. Huysman, at a meeting of the Socialists in Brussels on March loth, appealed to the working classes of Europe to combine in an International Republic, in which strategical frontiers would, have no place. At the close of the meeting there were scenes of enthusiasm, &quot; LTnternationale &quot; was sung, and there were cries of &quot; Vive la Rhine ! Vive les Soviets ! Vive la Revolution ! &quot;There is depression all over Belgium, noticeably at Bruges, and, of course, a great, deal of unemployment, but the authorities do not expect any outbreaks. They are quietly attempting to organise the Civic Guard on a new pattern.Switzerland. The Swiss General Staff does not expect any serious trouble for six months. Reaction is consolidating, and the Swiss Bolshevik Party is very short of money. When Platten&apos;s mission returns from Petrograd, the Swiss Government hopes to deport all unsatisfactory Russians, for personal contact in the workshops has more influence with the Swiss working man than oratory. Platten&apos;s most active supporters are young Jews.Tfie extremists appear to be splitting into two parties, - and this may be the undoing of the revolutionaries. There have been rumours for some time that a general strike would break out towards the end of the month at Bale and Zurich, where the German communities were expected to join the rioters. The authorities were quite ready, but nothing took place.Platten attended the Soviet Congress at Moscow, and has not yet returned.The German frontier control is very slack, and Bolshevik agents find no difficulty in.passing it with false passports made out in the wrong names.77s6-3&amp; d
Bands of Bolsheviks of from 50 to 100 are roaming about on the other side of the Swiss frontier, and it, is feared that in the event of a rising in Zurich they may cross and assist the rioters.Germany. The German Government is genuinely alarmed about Bolshevism in Germany, and is fighting it, but it fails to recognise the dangers which would assail Germany if it spread in enemy countries. A propaganda leaflet which was being circulated among the troops in occupied territory contains internal evidence that it was drafted by an American. Other leaflets of the same kind seem to have been drafted and printed by Russians.   They are rather feeble productions.Scheidemann, commenting on events in Hungary, on March. 2-lth, said that the formation of a Bolshevik Government in Hungary was the result of the &quot;Imperialism of the Entente.&quot; &quot; The Allies were playing with fire when they refused to sign Peace immediately.&quot; All this seems to support the view that there is stage-manage-ment in the presentation of Bolshevism in the Central Empires.A German journalist whose sympathies are believed to be with France, where he was long a Press correspondent, is of opinion that the great preoccupation of the German Government is to convince Europe that Germany has renounced the spirit of the former regime. lie said that at a recent meeting of the National Assembly a tempest of applause greeted the speech of Nauiuann, the author of &quot; Mitteleuropa,&quot; in which he said that Germany would not be debarred from the expansion to which she is entitled, and that though she wants peace, her downfall has not reduced her to such a state that she will accept whatever burden is laid upon her. He is of opinion that there is a secret understanding between the German Government and the Bolsheviks and that Germany will set forth again on her Imperialistic march as soon as peace has dissolved the Entente against her.On the other hand, Spartacism lives upon the lack of work, poverty of food, and the feeling that the present Government is Socialist only in name. Vengeance for Liebknecht mid Luxembourg plays no. part in the inarch of events they are already almost forgotten. If the SpartaCists had any leader they might be in power, but Eichhorn-the one man who might have seized the reins lost his opportunity by disappearing and deserting his followers. The greatest menace to Scheidemann&apos;s Government is the disaffection of the troops. How far the infection has spread among them is uncertain, but if the&quot;present strikes spread and become general, the Spartacists may succeed in a coup cVetat.Austria. The Military Governor of Vienna is believed to have 4,000 police and about 15,000 Volkswehr to keep order. The latter, in his opinion, are not to be counted on, but the police are loyal, though they can hold important points like the Arsenal only for about three days. An outbreak was expected early in April, but the Military Governor thought that a single regiment of French, British, or American troops (not Italians) would be sufficient to maintain order.The Spartacist movement is growing in Silesia, and the numbers are now believed to be about 20,000, but for the moment Vienna appears to be the danger spot.The Socialists in Austria are reported to have replied to the manifesto of the Hungarian Proletariat, greeting it with sympathy, but declaring that on account of. the lack of food, German-Austria is at the mercy of the Allies, and cannot take part in a revolutionary movement.   This is a remarkable excuse.An American informant states that the Government is seriously considering whether it will hand its power over to a Soviet, as was done in Hungary. He thinks that the only salvation would, be a definite statement from the Allies that they would oppose Bolshevism and that this would strengthen the Government.Bohemia. Food consignments are now coining into the country and producing ah excellent effect.   The chief activity of the Bolsheviks is in the mineral districts.Hungary. A Government proclamation states that only Socialism, the creation of Communism, is capable of preserving the country from the anarchy of disruption ; that as the Paris Conference had decided on the military occupation of Hungarian territory, the revolution had only one means of salvation, namely, &quot;the Dictatorship of.the Proletariat.&quot; This motive for &quot;going red&quot; is quite inconsistent with the Russian form of Bolshevism,&apos;which recognises no frontiers and no patriotism. Count Karolyi, moreover, is reported to be in close touch with the new Government.There seems to be a disposition to bo friendly to English and Americans, though not to the French.   Bela Kun, the Foreign Secretary, a lieutenant in the reserve, is a
Tew, as are Pogany, Commissary for War, a non-commissioned officer in the Army, and Bohn, Commissary for Industry.Bosnia. Early in March revolutionary movements broke out in Bosnia, Slavonia and Croatia, and villages were overrun by bands of armed peasants firing on the Serbian troops.   The authorities are reported to be powerless.Italy. The Socialist Party in Italy is planning a great celebration for April 7th, the fiftieth anniversary of the Tuscan Revolution; a &quot; red week&quot; is promised. For the first time since the Avar, the Socialist and Revolutionary Parties are joining in a demonstration.   The Government is taking the necessary steps.Six thousand technical foremen in Turin are on strike. Coke has risen to 1,000 lire a ton, and other necessities are rising proportionately. The exchange has jumped to 745, and the economic condition is becoming serious.Norway. From private letters it appears that a general strike is in contemplation during this month. A pamphlet Avas recently distributed in Avorkshops in Christiania, recommending sabotage, on the ground 1 hat machine power should be made to strike in concert with manual power, so that &quot; blacklegs &quot; might not be employed as strike-breakers.Sweden. The most hopeful factor at the moment is the split between the Bolsheviks and the other extreme Socialists, which Avill Aveaken the position of the Party in tbe impending Communal elections. The Executive Committee of the Socialist Party has published in the Politiken a resolution to be adopted at mass meetings, declaring &quot; the necessity for an immediate international rally round the ideas, programme, and tendencies represented by so-called Bolshevism and Spartacism.&quot; This led to a revolt of the extreme Socialists.Denmark. A letter found among the papers of Dr. Bero. Avho was deported on March 27th, seems to confirm the report that the Bolsheviks have been fabricating English notes :-&quot; The financial question has been solved by the dies we have received from Germany, so that we can now issue once more 500-rouble Nicholas notes. Our manufacture of 1,000-franc and British pound notes has in addition surpassed all expectation : the biggest banks abroad change them Avithout hesitation.&quot;Forged 1Z. notes that would answer this description have not yet been discovered in this country.The Americans report that Bolshevik agents are recruiting Russians in Denmark to return to Russia, probably to serve in the Red Army.Though the Bolsheviks have no official representative in Copenhagen, they use their Red Cross representative.Holland, Though everyone is agreed that Holland swarms with Bolsheviks and that, in the event of Germany becoming Spartacist, there Avill be serious trouble, the position at present is more stable than it was. The police authorities do not think that any outbreak is imminent. Though 25 per cent, of the Dutch population are either Social Democrats or Bolsheviks, fortunately the two parties do not agree. The bourgeois have formed a Civil Guard and quite a number of working men belong to neither of the revolutionary parties. A fortnightly ahti-Bolshevik paper La Defense, is now being published in Amsterdam, edited by Baron Rene de Schacken. Among its objects is the organisation of a special service of volunteers to keep observation on the arrival and movements of Bolshevik agents. The Anti-Bolshevik League, which supports this paper, intends to nominate delegates to represent it in England, as well as in other countries.Though the Dutch police are scrutinising immigrants very closely, in order to exclude alien Bolsheviks, their hands are tied (as is the case in this country) when the Bolshevik agent is of Dutch nationality. Thus, Madame Rutgers-Mees, Avho has lately come from Moscow in possession of a large sum of money for Bolshevik purposes, was able to enter the country unchallenged. A member of the Dutch Government stated lately to the Americans that the Reel Army hoped to enter Germany in April or May, and that the Bolshevik group in Holland would then rise at Groningen.
Spain. Strikes and riots are fast subsiding, and the atmosphere is clearer. The-settlement at Barcelona was a victory for the Syndicalists.Portugal. It is reported that the Democratic Party contains officials who are&apos; bttle better than Bolsheviks.   The Minister of the Interior is stated to have said, &quot; Well, after all, Bolshevism, though not quite in the Russian form, is the future doctrine of the world, and it is no use taking too strong measures against it.&quot;A new newspaper, A Batalha, the organ of the Workers&apos; Union, is openly Bolshevik, and nothing can be done to stop it.Argentina. The Americans report that Bolshevism has developed in the Argentine and will spread to other countries on the Continent.
