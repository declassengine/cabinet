SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN   AND GENERALREPORT No. 138.General. This is the last issue of the &quot; Western and General&quot; Report in its present form.As the aftermath of the war. in countries dealt with in this Report, there are still difficult and delicate situations in the Baltic States, in Italy, in Dalinatia, in Hungary, and in the Far East (China and Japan). Hopes are built upon the League of Nations as a means, in course of time, of reducing the probability of such situations leading to open conflicts.Austria. The coal scarcity is reaching an acute stage.Baltic States. National aspirations of Esthonians and Letts, conflict of interestswith Germans and Russians, and the want of an agreed combined ptolicy of theAllied and Associated Powers, have led to a confused situation of which it isimpossible to foresee the outcome.    Co-operation between Esthonians, Letts, andFinns has not been accomplished, and the German forces appear to be beyond thecontrol of their Government.   It is not clear from what sources the German troops and soldiers in the Baltic States are being financed and supplied.*China. Japanese complicity in the difficulties that have arisen over the Tibet Frontier settlement has been denied.Finland. - The danger to Finland which would result from a settlement between the Bolsheviks and the Baltic States is realised.Germany. The Government has complied with the recpiest to amend Article 61 (German-Austria) of the Constitution.Lord Kilmarnock&apos;s report on the German policy in Russia is of special interest.Italy. The internal situation in Italy may reach a perilous stage, owing to the situation in Fiume and Dalmatia. The probability of serious friction with the Serbs and Southern Slavs is indicated.Peace Discussions. The summary is continued from former Reports. The terms of peace were communicated on September .19th to the representatives of Bulgaria.G. G. A,September 25th, 1919.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.NOTE.-In accordance with a decision of the War Cabinet (August 19th, Minutes 617. 5) the &quot; Western and General,&quot; &quot; Eastern,&quot; and the foreign portion of the &quot; British Empire and Africa &quot; weekly Reports will be combined after the 1st of October in a &quot; Foreign Countries &quot; Report, issued fortnightly.AUSTRIA.Dr. lienner on the Future. At a Conference of representatives.of the various Austrian countries and the Government, Dr. Renner, who presided, stated that the Peace negotiations had resulted in a Treaty which Austria would scarcely he able to bear. Her only hope lay in the League of Nations and the Reparations Commission. He emphasised the fact that the Austrian State was in reality the German Alps, and for this reason &quot; The German Alpine Lands &quot; was the name best suited to it. The Austrian State would probably be so designated in the future. It had been possible to a certain extent to avert the evil results of the idea that the Republic was the absolute heir to the old Austria. Although the economic and financial terms of the Peace Treaty were hard and still somewhat Gbscure, they were not altogether unfavourable in those points which directly affected the State as such. From, the point of view of an inheritance of rights, the Austrian Republic was entitled to rights of possession over all the property of the former Austrian State, even on the territory of the National States. This property must be purchased by the National States and the purchase money would be paid into the Reparations Fund to the credit of Austria. With regard to Austria&apos;s orientation towards the West, Dr. Renner pointed out that the West included Germany and Italy. Austria should settle her affairs as became a world Power and not according to the pattern of the Baltic States. This did not mean, however, that the ideal, innate in every people, of a union with its racial kinsmen should be repudiated (Nauen, September 17th).Jugo-Slav Occupation of Radkersburg. According to information from Graz the town of Radkersburg in Styria, which was allotted to German-Austria by the Peace Treaty, has not been eAracuated by the Jugo-Slavs. On the contrary they are concen-traling troops and closing the bridges over the Mur. They are also expelling the Germans and depriving them of food supplies. The population demands the occupation of Radkersburg by Entente troops in order that the terms of the Peace Treaty with Austria may be carried out (Nauen, September .18th).The Goal Crisis. According to a Wireless message from Vienna (September. 19th) the coal crisis completely dominates the situation and puts all political and external events into the background. In view of all official declarations the fears entertained for the next week in A&quot;ienna are completely justified. The people cannot understand Avhy the Entente do not immediately inteiwene in order to put an end to the intolerable situation. The Mittagapost asserts that order in Vienna is endangered and Avarns the Entente against the coining Avinter.German Wireless (Nauen, September 21st) comments on the situation as follows :   &quot; The coal scarcity in Vienna is likely at any moment to bring about an economic catastrophe. The hopelessness of the economic situation only increases the yearning for union with Germany. More and more emphasis is given to the vieAV that the coal scarcity would not have reached such threatening proportions had German-Austria been able to unite with Germany. The workers are even ready to blame the Austrian bourgeoise for not effecting this union at the right time.THE BALTIC STATES.Peace 2\egotiations tvith the Bolsheviks. The British Deputy Commissioner at Reval reported on September 20th that, according to information given him by M. Poska, the Esthonian delegates had informed the Bolshevik delegates at Pskov that they would only enter into peace negotiations provided that all tbe four Baltic States took part in them -simultaneously. The Bolsheviks replied that they only had authority to negotiate with Esthonia. [It is still doubtful Avhether negotiations have been interrupted or definitely broken off.]
On September 21st the Esthonian Government enquired of the Deputy Com-missioner what role Esthonia was expected by the Allied and Associated Powers to perform.   Reasons were given for accepting the Bolshevik peace proposals.The Deputy Commissioner further reported that the &quot;Military Party did not believe that peace woidd be concluded. General Rodzianko, however, observed a similar spirit of insubordination among the Esthonian troops on the Narva front as prevailed among the Russian troops previous to the Revolution.M. Poska stated that it was still intended to hold the second Conference of Baltic States at Dorpat to discuss future policy.The Norths West Russian Government had been invited to send a representative to attend the Conference.M. Poska has reiterated the Governments decision not to make peace or even suspend hostilities without the sanction of Great Britain. He points out. however, that internal unrest and the unreliability of the Army renders the situation one of great difficulty which can only be alleviated by Great Britairds material help and recognition of Esthonian independence (Deputy Commissioner, September 18th). On September 22nd M. Poska recapitulated his private views in an interview with Mr. Bosanquet. British protection and control would be welcomed. Advice by different Allied Dowers was divergent. The danger of German influence in Russia wasvemphasised.The Latvian Government has expressed willingness to fight the Bolsheviks on certain conditions, which include the enforced evacuation of the country by Russian and German troops (Colonel Talfents, September 22nd).Russian Disorganisation. In a report dated September Sth the Senior Naval Officer in the Baltic states that &quot;the Russians are in a state of disorganisation, which&apos;! increases owing to intrigues and quarrels among the Generals and German influence.&quot; He is of opinion that &quot;no hope can be entertained of these troops going forward daring the present campaigning season, unless the Finns and Esthonians both agree to advance and co-operate.&quot; On September 23rd the Prime Minister of the Russian North-West Government made enquiries about British policy (Mr. Bosanquet).German Aggression. Colonel Tallents reports that the insolence of the German forces in Courland is increasing and may lead to the overthrow of the Lettish Government.According to a German Wireless report (September 19th), General von der Goltz assembled in Mitau the leaders of the troops and pointed out to them the serious difficulties confronting the troops in the event of their remaining longer in Latvia, and in the event of the failure of support from the home country. The General demanded unconditional obedience and announced the plan of evacuation.BELGIUM.Flemish Movement.  In a despatch from Brussels, dated September 10th, Mr. Gurney, on the charge of high treason brought against M. Bonus, one of the most prominent of the Activists, for his dealings with the Germans during the occupation. M. Bonus&apos; death sentence was commuted to penal servitude. In connection with the Flemish movement, Cardinal Mercier has quoted with effect a letter addressed by Pope Leo XIII. to the Bishops of Bohemia and Moravia in 1901, in which he deplored the seeds of discord sown by an exaggerated attachment to the mother tongue.CHINA.Thibet Frontier Question. The Japanese Minister at Peking denies any responsibility on the part of Japan either for the breakdown of the negotiations on the Thibet frontier or anti-British propaganda in the Press and elsewhere.* As the result of an interview with the Japanese Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs now declares that he has no proof of Colonel Banzai&apos;s complicity in drafting the letter opposing the agreement (vide Report No. 137, page 3), and must, therefore, withdraw his previous statement. He remains convinced, however, that the agitation against the negotiations was manufactured by the militarists acting under Japanese influence and in direct opposition to the people. He intends to prepare a statement with the object of enlightening public opinion (Sir J. Jordan, September 16th and 1.9th).
-JCZECHOSLOVAKIA.Traffic on the Elbe. Mr. Gosling (Prague) learns that a proposal lias been made on behalf of German interests for the appointment of a Czecho-Slovak Commission, to include Germans, for the purpose of discussing the unification and exploitation of steamship traffic on the Elbe.FINLAND.Bolshevik Peace Overtures. Sir C. Kennard states that, according to the opinion expressed by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Finnish Government is at present prepared to decide its policy towards Soviet Russia in accordance with the wishes of the British Government. Some announcement, however, as to the policy which Finland is desired to adopt will be necessary to prevent the belief gaining ground that Great Britain has disinterested herself from the attitude of: Finland towards Russia.Sir C. Kennard gives the summary of the articles published in the Press of September ISth dealing with the decision of the Supreme Council on its policy in Russia : &quot;If the decision involves the definite abandonment of the Entente&apos;s active interest in Russia the gravest prospect is opened to the States who have only by great efforts been able to keep Bolshevism under.&quot; We are on a half-and-half war footing with the Soviet Government and the latter has very considerable forces on the Eastern frontier. The Government nmst obtain a clear understanding as to the intentions of the Entente in the event of the Soviet deciding to attack us &quot; (Abo Underrattelser).&quot; The important thing for us is the application of the Paris decision to the peoples bordering on Russia. These can now obviously decide their relations with the Soviet Government without any obstacle being placed in their way by the Allies and can choose peace or war as they please. Finland is faced with great risks in detei-mining her attitude. Obviously there can be no question of isolated action on our part.&quot; We must act with the other border States. It must, however, be remembered that the Government of Finland is in sharp contrast to that of the border States Avhich are more Socialist. Finland is distinguished from them too by a difference of culture and a well-known contrast between their institutions&quot; (Dagens Press).&quot; Are we to draw the conclusion that the Entente Powers support our making peace with the Soviet&apos;? It is especially difficult and dubious for Finland to enter into negotiations with Bolshevik Russia. But without the support and military help of the Entente it is impossible for the border States to continue war against the Soviet&quot; (PLelsivgin Sanomat).&quot;It is certain that the conclusion of peace by Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, no matter what stipulations are included in the Treaty regarding the duty of the Bolsheviks to keep their doctrines and methods to their own territory, will open the frontiers and create new possibilities of Bolshevik agitation. But Finland without the assistance of the Entente cannot stand alone in a state of war &quot; (Uuse Suomi).The Social Demokraati states in its leader that (1) the step towards peace with the Soviet will be received with satisfaction ; (2) the re-opening of commercial relations with Russia will prevent Bolshevism in Finland ; (3) the better guarantee for Finnish independence will be found in the peaceful development of the Soviet system than in its overthrow by Finnish or foreign armies.General Mannerheim. General Mannerheim was expected to arrive in London on September 25th. When at Stockholm he represented^ to Sir E. Howard that the situation in Finland would be very serious if Esthonia made peace with the Bolsheviks (September 22nd). - [See also under Sweden.]FRANCE.Press Criticisms of British Policy. Sir G. Grahame gives the gist of a leading article in the Temps of September 19th criticising in an unfriendly and sarcastic manner the various points in the Prime MinisteFs speech at the City Temple with regard to foreign questions and Ireland. It observes, in dealing with the latter, that Mr. Lloyd George asks for fair play on both sides, which is exactly what the Sinn Feiners are asking for.    Between an Irish&apos; population which demands independence and the
British Army which applies to Ireland a regime of martial law, the Sinn Feiners declare that they see no fair play. The article quotes President Wilson&apos;s recent O statement in reply to questions about Ireland, and interprets this reply to mean that the Irish problem might be taken before the League of Nations. Tire Temps says that what is true about Ireland applies evidently to the eventual claims of the Separatist party in South Africa, the Egyptians and the Hindus ; and still more so to the Persians. Mr. Lloyd George has been trying to run two opposing policies, one on the lines of the League of Nations and the other maintaining and aggrandising the British Empire according to methods which are now to be seen at work in Ireland and the East. The Action Francai.se of September 22nd comments on the attitude of the Times on Palestine and on Zionism.Fiume Situation. Sir G. Grahame reported on September 22nd that the comments in the French Press generally on the coup cielat by JTAnnunzio had been singularly reserved&apos; and, on the whole, not unsympathetic towards Italian aspirations.Socialist Congress. In a despatch dated September 15th, Sir G. Grahame reported on the National Congress of the French Socialist Party, opened on September 11th.GERMANY.The Constitution and Union with Austria. The following reply has been made by the German Government to the Allied Note on Article 01 of the Constitution (Nauen, September .19th) : &quot; The German Government agrees with the view exjrressed in the Allied and Associated Governments Note of September 11th that, in so far as the German Constitution and the Peace Treaty are at variance, the former cannot be upheld. The German Government has already stated that it accepts the Allied and Associated Governments&apos; interpretation of Article 80 of the Peace Treaty, and regards Article 61, para. 2, of the German Constitution as invalid, until the Council of the League of Nations has agreed to a corresponding alteration in the international situation of Austria. The German Government has no objection to making this declaration in the form prescribed by the Note of September 11th. For this purpose it has provided the Councillor to the Legation with the necessary full powers and instructed him to communicate with representatives of the Allied and Associated GoA-ernments as to the date on which the declaration should take place.&quot; The German Government is compelled to make the following observations with regard to the statements of the Allied and Associated Governments ; it is a misrepresented-seutation of the text and sense of the German Note of September Sth to say that the German Government wished to uphold the view that no Article, of the Constitution could be in contradiction to the Peace Treaty, because there exists another Article in the Constitution which states that none of its provisions could adversely affect the Peace Treaty. The German Government pointed out that the Article in question was intended to exclude any possible contradiction that might arise between the text of the Constitution and the terms of the Peace Treaty. That Article SO also of the Peace Treaty contains pi-provisions, the import of winch are not without ambiguity, is. proved by the statements with which the German Government supported its original interpretation of the Article, an interpretation differing from that of the Allied and Associated Governments. According to a generally recognised principle provisions which  denote the limitation of elementary fundamental laws should not be too widely interpreted. Germany could not assume that the right of self-determination of peoples, which her opponents have so often declared to be one of the main pillars of their peace terms, should be still more curtailed for Germany and Austria than the text of Article 80 would warrant. In addition the Allied and Associated Governments in their observations concerning Article 178 of the Constitution omitted to consider-that in the constitution of a State a law is involved which from its very nature contains provisions of a fundamental character not limited by time. It is in accordance with the usual forms of legislation, if in such a fundamental law the general rules are established, but reservations are made with a Adew to special cases which already exist or are to be foreseen. Such exceptions to the general rule in now way cancel the rule itself, especially when these exceptions refer to definite particular cases or are limited by time or themselves provide for a subsequent alteration. The inclusion of Article 178 in the German Constitution is not a subterfuge but a necessary measure. In this respect the Allied and Associated Gevernmeuts have erroneously concluded that Article 61 was intended to be a violation, of the Treaty.   The German Government8S8-1-lb B
Gsharply repudiates this imputation. It cannot accept in silence the ironical tone in which the Allied and Associated Governments think lit to treat the solemn declarations of the German Government. The fact that Germany lost tire war does not give her ^1 opponents the right to use language calculated to humiliate Germany in the eyes of the whole world. The German Government will not imitate the Allied and Associated Governments in this respect. The establishment of a real state of peace can only be impeded by such procedure on the part of the Allied and Associated Powers.&quot;The Centre Party and llie Rhineland. With regard to tho proposal for a Rhenish State, the Centre Party in the Rhineland have established the principles which should govern any possible realisation of the desire for Rhenish independence within the German State. This could only be effected by constitutional means in connection with a territorial reorganisation and subject to the common German interests. The object of their efforts should be the creation of a united German State with autonomous territories of the same race. At the same time the Centre Party declared that whoever took part in open or secret agitation in favour of separation from Germany injured the national and economic interests of the Rhenish population and dissociated himself from the Centre Party. The German Government would be called upon to reorganise the State on these lines (Nauen, September ISth).The Future of Memel.- The German Foreign Minister, Herr Midler, has charged the Councillor to the Legation, vonLersner, in Versailles, to deliver the following Note to the Allies : &quot; Representatives of the district, of Memel, which, according to Part III., section 10, of the Peace Treaty, is to be ceded to the Allied and Associated Powers, have repeatedly petitioned the German Government to bring about a speedy decision of their future political and international status. The overwhelming majority of the inhabitants desire no change in the actual situation. In any case, however, they demand that the question of nationality should be decided by the people themselves in accordance with the principle of self-determination. All the inhabitants of the district of Memel consider the present situation as burdensome and harmful. The economic life of this district, which is dependent on a brisk trade, is seriously hampered. The spirit of enterprise is crippled, while national and social differences are growing more acute. Owing to this situation the Government itself is faced with a considerable number of administrative difficulties of a technical character. An early definition of the attitudes of the Allied and Associated Powers with regard to the district of Memel in accordance with the wishes of the population would help to remove all these disadvantages &quot; (Nauen, September 21st).Russian Policy. Lord kilmarnock (Copenhagen) learns through a reliable source that at a meeting of Socialist Ministers of the Central and Prussian Govern-ments convoked by Herr Scheidemann in Berlin on September I5th, certain secret documents dealing with the plans of General von der Goltz were discussed. According to these documents a Treaty had been concluded between von der Goltz, the Baltic Barons, aud General Lieven, with the object of helping the Russian Northern Army to overthrow Bolshevism, provided that von der Goltz could carry out a successful coup d&apos;etat in Berlin. Lieven undertook to protect the Fast Prussian frontier against an invasion of the Poles if this was ordered hy the Entente. Some of the Socialists present at the meeting demanded an immediate alliance with the Bolsheviks, but Herr Midler and Herr David opposed this demand. It was finally decided (1) to publish von der Goltz&apos;s plans in the Press ; (2) to conduct a counter-agitation in the Reichswehr amongst those officers and men, who were in favour of a Republic ; (3) to send, delegates to Moscow to make an alliance with the Bolsheviks in case the Entente were unable to stop von der Goltz&apos;s intrigues.Spartacist Plot in Dusseldorf.  The Spartacists in Dusseldorf planned a &quot; coup &quot; for Saturday night. The military authorities, however, had obtained -definite knowledge of the plan, which aimed at releasing the inmates of the prisons, over-powering the garrison, and occupying the most important points in the town. The garrison, was therefore held in readiness, and the guards and sentries strengthened. The night passed without incident. The situation, however, is considered by the military authorities to be as serious as ever (German Wireless, September 22ud).&apos;  ITALY.Situation at Fiume. On September 17th Mr. Kennard reported that the situation was still obscure. All communication with the town had been cut off. The number of mutinous troops was now stated to be about 1,900, together with 100 sailors.
Telegraphing on September 20th Mr. Kennard stated that Jugo-Slav volunteers had attempted to land on the Dalmatian coast occupied by Italian troops, but were prevented from doing so.Popular sympathy in favour of lTAnnunzio was increasing, but was not shared by the Government or the more reasonable sections of the Press. By September 23rd the Press was wavering.Later reports from Mr. Kennard show that tbe popular movement in favour of an Italian annexation of Fiume was being extended rapidly (September 23rd, 2-ith) into one for occupation of Daliuatia. It seemed that the movement had got beyond the control of the Government, which was not likely to be able to solve the problem in a manner which would satisfy both the Italian people and the Allied Powers. The meeting of an extraordinary Council, presided over by the King, and consisting of notable statesmen and of Naval and Military officers, was arranged for September 25th. There is no precedent for such an assembly since the Kingdom of Italy was established (September 22ud), and its convocation shows how grave a situation has arisen (September 23rd). On September 23rd Sir It. Rodd reported on the gravity of the Fiume situation, and on the work of the Royal Council, which will decide whether a change of Government is desirable. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs realises how serious an effect unrest in Italy might produce in Europe.Friction with Serbians.--Encounters- between Italians and Serbs have been &quot; reported  from   Antivari, Cattaro and Albania (Sir R.  Rodd and Mr. Kennard, September 23rd).Woman Suffrage.  Sir R. Rodd reports in a despatch dated September Sth that the Chamber of Deputies met on the 3rd instant. At this sitting a Bill for the extension of the suffrage to 11,000,000 women was submitted. It will not, however, take effect during the coming elections, as there would now be no time to prepare the electoral register. The President of the Council, in inviting the approval of the Chamber for this measure, stated that he had at first hesitated for some time on the question of proportional representation, but he had realised that the leaders of the various parties were in favour of it and had come round to their opinion. lie was very glad that it had been accepted by the Chamber. He was also at first unprepared to submit at the present time the question of the vote for women. Now he could say he was sincerely ru favour of it, and he trusted it would be passed. It was in fact passed by a large majority and with so little dissent as to suggest an apathetic-attitude on the part of the moribund Chamber.Causes of the Caporetto Disaster. -In the same despatch Sir R. Rodd states that Signor Nitti also agreed that a discussion should be allowed on the report of the Commission which investigated the causes of the Caporetto disaster, and proposed to place on the order of the day a communication from the Government on the subject. The Socialist Party are endeavouring to make great capital for electoral purposes out of the evidence in the report of summary executions and harsh treatment of the men. On the other hand, the organisations of ex-soldiers are holding meetings to protest against any attempt to disparage the army, and the Press is also condemning in strong language the ttnjustifiable use which is being made of a report which is meeting with considerable criticism also on account of the indiscriminating manner in which certain one-sided statements have been made public.Socialism. A copy of a Memorandum on the situation of the various Socialist factions in Italy at the beginning of September has been received from Sir R. Rodd. After alluding to the difficulty of obtaining as impartial an estimate from the Avanti of the views of the Moderate Socialists as of those of the extreme group, the writer states that &quot; the consensus of Socialist and other opinion of all parties in Italy with regard to the failure of the strike of the 20th-21st July is that the wind was taken out of the Extremists&apos; sails by the food strikes in the earlier portion of that month. Had the Labour leaders been able either to restrain the active demonstration of public opinion till the later date, or had the general strike been proclaimed&apos; for an earlier date and the cry of the proletariat against the middle clases and wealth been coupled with an active protest against the price of living, the consequences would certainly have been far more serious. The development of the food riots showed a very distinct aptitude on the part of Labour organisations to&apos;control the first stages, l-equisitioning and distribution of food in the country, with a tendency to allow the population to exceed the bounds of moderation.&quot; In Florence the Government used the Labour organisation under the local Government officials, and in Rome the Laboursss-i n .    . c
sleaders were called to sit on municipal food committees. Thus the people were satisfied that their representatives were in charge, and the normal regime of Government was unconsciously re-established.The Extreme Socialists have admitted the failure of the general strike which was due to the feeble support of the Moderates, the reduction in food prices, and the attitude of French and British Labour.Meanwhile, the decisions made during the discussions of the Maximalist programme and Socialist election policy at the meetings at Beggio Emilia &quot; are loudly heralded by the Avavti as a definite policy-for all the masses to follow, but a difference of opinion in tlie ranks of the Socialist party is admitted &quot;in respect of method rather than of objective. The discussion of the question of what action should be taken in the forthcoming elections showed that real divergencies existed, although subsequent speeches and leading articles try to prove that the main policy is the same on both wings, and that the Maximalist doctrines are favoured by all. The question of the violent electoral propaganda and organisation or complete abstention of all Socialists from the polls in November has arisen and has been discussed. The advocates of the former have argued in support, of their opinions that, though they would favour revolutionary action on principle, they do not consider the country ready in respect of organisation for such a policy, and that strong and cohesive Parliamentary action would be more profitable at the moment. Their opponents, per contra, argue that the proletariat is not sufficiently well organised to have enough influence at the elections to make such a course worth while, and that complete abstention, which would make any Government feel uneasy in that large masses would be unrepresented, followed by concrete revolutionary action later, will certainly be more effective.....&quot; Superficially, therefore, there appears no divergence of opinion as regards objective in Socialist Italy which is preparing for the Bologna Congress, though very noteworthy differences of opinion exist as to the methods to be used. At the same time, many people feel that when the final decisions have to be taken at the elections, a split may occur, and definite Maximalist and Moderate or possibly Minimalist Parties may be found.&quot; Unfortunately, as the Corriere della Sera says on August 29th, the war has brought about a form of political neurosis post belliea. Many Socialist organisations have recently come into being all over Italy, composed of hot-headed young men prepared to vote orders of the clay in the most extreme terms, and ready to advocate the most outrageous revolutionary methods, and the representatives of their bodies at Bologna will have as much power when voting occurs there as the older Socialists of the Moderate Party, or even the senior men of the Extremist Party, who are responsible for all the organisation and institutions of the Italian proletariat up to the present time. Even some of the Extremists such as Lazzari, among the elder men, or Vella and Bacci, among the younger Extremists-will surely not abandon their policy of progress and bettering the conditions of the working classes at all costs for a regime of complete anarchy.....&quot; As far as can be seen superficially tbe country is being &apos; worked &apos; by the Socialists very vigorously. The C.G.L. is very active everywhere, and is creating new C.L. where they are wanted.....&quot; The agricultural unions have come more to the fore of late over the occupation of the land and through their activity in Southern Italy, but it is not clear wdiat the ill-feeling between them and the metal-workers&apos; federations may produce in the future.&quot; The Socialists as a mass support free trade in principle, though the Unita recently said there were only 10 true free-traders headed by Modigliani, who proposed an amendment to the new tariff decree, in the party. Yet it is anomalous to consider that the Socialist organisation depends for its strength in great part on the metal workers whose industry requires the existence of a protective tariff. In principle also tliey would no doubt support the &quot;tax on capital or forced loan shortly to come into force, though it will be interesting to see whether union funds and labour in general are made liable to it.&quot;There are thus many elements of uncertainty. The rise in the price of bread to nearly i franc a kilo if the Government remove their subsidy amounting at present to 2 milliards yearly, will be the subject of much discontent, and the lack of fuel this -winter will have the same effect. It is hardly likely, however, that trouble will in any case develop until the winter, after the vintage and ensuing operations have been completed in, say. November, by which time the result of the elections will no doubt make itself felt.&quot;
Peace Treaty with Germany. On September 11th Sir R. Rodd gave the substance of the majority report by the Parliamentary Committee appointed to examine the terms of the Peace Treaty.The Committee hopes that enemy States, including Germany, will be admitted to the League of Nations as soon as possible.Credit is claimed for Italy for having initiated the first Labour Treaty, having in 1910 invited all the nations to confer in Pome on Labour legislation.Attention is drawn to the inadequacy of the economics provision so far as Italy is concerned, and the importance of obtaining raw material from the East is pointed out.The Committee does not approve of the trial of the ex-Kaiser, in view of con-siderations of public aud private right.Further details are given, and Socialist and Catholic Popular Party minority reports were expected.&apos; Elections. Mr. Kennard on September 13th reported on the new electoral districts.   The elections were expected to take place &quot; well on in November.&quot;JAPAN.The Consortium in China. Mr. Alston learns that the Japanese Government is determined to adhere to its policy demanding the exclusion of Manchuria and Mongolia from the scope of the consortium.MEXICO.Opposition to Carranza. Mr. Cummins reports that speeches delivered recently in the House of Deputies show a growing dissatisfaction towards Carranza. He is described as acting as a dictator and is accused of violating the Constitution. On September 19th the Deputies discussed a motion to deprive the President of the special powers granted to him for the control of the public finances.Prohibition of Chinese and Japanese immigration. Mr. Cummins states that the Governor of Lower California has prohibited the entry of Chinese and Japanese into that State.NETHERLANDS.Surrender of the ex-Kaiser. Mr. Robertson has gathered that the Dutch Government, when asked to surrender the ex-Kaiser, would not refuse categorically, and if a strong legal case could be put forward, the request might in the end be granted. In the first instance, the request would be referred to the Governments legal advisers (September 24th).SWEDEN.Hostility to General Mannerheim.
