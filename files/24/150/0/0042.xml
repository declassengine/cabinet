Chief interest now lies in the progress of the peace negotiations between Esthonia and the Russian Soviet Government. It remains to be seen whether the other Daltic Stales will follow Esthonia&apos;s example. Fear of an aggressive Germany and a reactionary Russia, and still more of a combination between the two, has undoubtedly influenced the Esthonian Government in taking this step.General Gough gives a clear account of the contending parties and their aspirations.China (page 4).

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.NOTE.-In accordance with a decision of the War Cabinet (August 19th, Minutes 617. 5) the &quot; Western and General,&quot; &quot; Eastern,&quot; and the foreign portion of the &quot; British Empire and Africa&quot; weekly Reports will be combined after the 1st of October in a &quot; Foreign Countries&quot; Report, issued fortnightly.AUSTRIA.Financial Assistance. His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has circulated a Foreign Office Memorandum (G.T. Sill) on the advantages of taking-immediate steps for the rehabilitation of Austria. The writer draws attention to the importance of giving earnest consideration to the proposals of a group of Austrian financial leaders. According to these, either the British Government or a financial syndicate should send at once to Vienna financial, mining and textile representatives to enquire into the position of the leading Austrian firms, and acquire options on 20 per cent, of the capital of the best. It is pointed out that these proposals show a preference on the part of Austria to trade with Great Britain and their acceptance would secure for the latter very large and important commercial interests not only in Austria itself hut in the congeries of States which formed the Austrq-Huhgarian Empire and of which Vienna was and will, from her position, probably remain the commercial centre. Dealing with the political situation, the writer states that unless Austria is speedily rehabilitated, Vienna will be faced with starvation ; and Austrians will be compelled to choose between a communistic regime or union with Germany.THE BALTIC STATES.General Gouglis Memorandum. The Secretary of State for War has circulated a Memorandum (G.T. 8101) in which General Gough describes (1) the circumstances leading to the formation of the North-West Russian Government; (2) the question of the recognition of Esthonian independence ; (3) the need for financial assistance to the North-West Russian Government.General Gough sums up the political and military situation as follows : &quot; Along the Baltic seaboard are people who are entirely different in race from the Russians or the Germans. These are Lithuanians, Letts and Esthonians, and on the north of the Gulf of Finland are the Finns.&quot; The question of race south of the Gulf is complicated to a certain extent, however, by the presence of a rich German aristocratic land-owning class, known as the Baltic Barons.   These are the remains oE German conquests many centuries ago.&quot; The Baltic Barons and Baits, although they possess the great proportion of the land and riches, and up to the war most of the political power, are numerically a very small proportion of the people, less, I believe I am correct in saying, than 5 per cent, of the population.&quot; The Lithuanians, Letts and Esthonians hate both the Russians and the Germans, and they do so for much the same reason, namely, both are tyrannical in their methods of government, and both deny all political liberty or opportunity for self-development to the local people, and both represent a strong class domination of the aristocracy.&quot; To both Russians and Germans, however, the Baltic Barons and Baits are attached, as from these Powers they expect to retain all their own great political and economic privileges. At the present time, owing to the Russians not being in any condition to support them, the Baits have thrown in their interests entirely with the Germans, and they have been led to do this by the presence and rule of German troops undisturbed in the country up to the present moment, added to which the workings of very active German propaganda must not be forgotten. This propa-ganda easily influences the Baltic Barons, for although they represent a certain standard of culture, it is culture which is very much in the direction of luxury and extravagance. Their mental equipment does not. go much further than speaking-several languages well; in political knowledge and sound judgment they are merely children.
oo&quot; The next two great factors hearing on the Baltic situation are Russia and Germany.&quot; For the moment, the German plan to colonise these Border States and establish a dominating influence has been threatened with failure by our action in Latvia, and by the retirement from the country of the German troops, now being carried out. (Latest information does not confirm this.)&quot; The Germans are carrying out an active propaganda, which has its influence on these easily-swayed peoples. There is a large section of the old Russians who are struggling energeticallj- to restore the old boundaries of Russia intact, and with it their own power. They violently oppose ideas of autonomy of the local Baltic State?, much more so do they oppose any idea of independence; feeling that the Entente favour these Border States, there is a great possibility of their calling in German aid to re-establish old Russia. There are signs that intrigues in this direction have already begun.&quot; Much will depend on what the future of Germany is going to be. Is it going to be Germany genuinely democratic, or are the Junkers and military caste again going to seize the power ? They undoubtedly intend to try. Should they succeed, they will support a monarchic and autocratic form of government in Russia and make an alliance with it ; one of their first steps will be to bring under a Russo-German domination the whole of the Baltic States, and from this threat even Finland will not be secure. Should a really democratic and peace-loving Germany arise, the danger will not be so great, but it is probable that under any circumstances a strong commercial penetration of Russia will take place, and this will be tolerated and encouraged by the Russians themselves.&quot; The only people who will not easily fall under the influence of the Germans or the Russians are the people of the Baltic Provinces. They hate and mistrust both too much. It will be necessary, however, for us to support these people commercially and politically if they are to withstand the German-Russian pressure. With our command of the sea, and by using to the full the excellent ports of Libau, Riga, Reval and Helsingfors, it should not be difficult for us to maintain a powerful political and commercial control along the Baltic.&quot; Such close and effective support by England in particular and the Allies generally, will tend to the development, happiness, self-government and general progress of these Baltic States. But it may involve us in hostility of Russia and Germany.&quot;Eslhonlan Peace Negotiations. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. fJoska, has informed the Deputy Commissioner at Reval that the Esthonian Government has decided to enter into peace negotiations with the Bolsheviks. He asserted that tbe Government only intended to gain time in order to restore the morale of the Army, which at present could not be relied upon. The decision, however, followed upon the visit to Reval of Professor Goode as LeniiFs representative.Tchicherine has sent a note to the Esthonian Government to the effect that having captured Yamburg and Pskov, the Soviet Government is willing to discuss peace terms together with questions relating to Esthonian independence and frontiers. The note declares that in fighting under Allied pressure against the Soviet Repiiblic the Esthonian people are acting against their oavii interests (Reval, September 3rd).A telegram from the British Mission at Helsingfors (September 2nd) ascribes the growing disaffection of the Baltic States to (1) mutinies among the troops ; (2) preference of Bolshevik to either Russian or German domination ; (3) continuance of the German occupation.Esthonian Land Bill. Mr. Wyatt (Reval) reports that paragraph. 1 of the Land Bill has passed its second reading. The clause exempting from expropriation peasant land under a certain size has been eliminated. The Bill, is therefore much more radical than at first proposed. This was probably a political manoeuvre, as a Trades Union Congress was being held. The Socialists promise to introduce an amendment on the third reading safeguarding peasant land.Alleged German Treaty with Latvia. The following information is derived from German Wireless news of September Oth and 7th : The Lettish Government in Riga, the Lettish Charge d&apos;Affaires in Berlin, and the Lettish Press have all denied that any treaty was concluded in Riga on December 29th, .1918, between the German Minister and the Lettish Government, according to which the German troops fighting in Courland should acquire Lettish citizenship and the right of colonisation.   The German Press now publishes the text of a Treaty
concluded, in Riga on December 29th, 191S, and : signed. by August Winnig, the German Minister in Riga, and Ulmanis, the Lettish Prime Minister.The first paragraph of the Treaty states that the Provisional Lettish Government declares itself ready to grant full citizenship of the Lettish State to all troops of a foreign State who have been voluntarily engaged for at least four weeks ih the light for the liberation of the territory of the Lettish State from the Bolsheviks. The newspapers point out in this connection that the present Prime Minister. Ulmanis, who is now breaking the Treaty, was one of the signatories to it.Writing in Vorwarts on the origin of the confused state of affairs in the Baltic Provinces; August Winnig states that, owing to the menacing advance of the Bolsheviks, the Lettish Government declared their willingness to grant the right of citizenship to all the German soldiers avIio would fight for the defence of the country. A Treaty to this effect was concluded on December 29th, 1.918. As the pressure of the Bolsheviks increased, the Lettish Government became anxious to negotiate even concerning the settlement of the German soldiers in Courland. The negotiations, however, did not lead to a definite result. The German soldiers would justly consider themselves the victims of deception should the Lettish Government be able to adduce any reasons for breaking the Treaty.Winnig concludes : &quot; Owing to the Peace Treaty being ffirced upon us, we have no means of enforcing the recognition of the Treaty. The compulsory order of the Entente, however, cannot do away Avith the German soldiers&apos; right. The deluded German soldiers should certainly be Avithdrawu from Latvia.&quot;On September 4th the Minister of State, Midler, handed a Note to the Lettish Minister, Schreiber, expressing the deep regret of the German Government for the acts of violence committed by the German troops in Mitau. At the same time it Avas pointed out that the origin of the excesses lay in the embitterment of the German troops due to the refusal of the Lettish Government to carry out its promise to grant the rights of citizenship and settlement in Courland. In spite of this, the German Government&quot;Avere making every effort to influence the troops through their leaders, in order to prevent further outbursts and to secure the complete evacuation of Latvia.German Evacuation. A telegram from Berlin dated September Gth states that the German Government has addressed a Note to the Entente regretting that the evacuation of the Baltic regions which had been ordered has come to a stop owing to insubordination on the part of the German troops still in Courland.In the meantime, the Note adds, in consequence of the restrictions imposed by the Allied and Associated Governments, the German Government is not in a position to compel the obedience of its troops by military means. There is, therefore, nothing else for the German GoAreninient to do than to try by persuasion to bring the troops to reason. General von der Goltz solely on this ground has returned to Mitau. As soon as the desired object has been achieved, his superiors will immediately recall him.As the result of extremely excited feeling amongst the troops, it is for the present impossible to settle a plan of evacuation, and especially one for the transport of troops to the sea.A telegram has been received from the British Mission at Riga to the effect that in an interview with&apos; General Burt, Aron der Goltz stated that he could give no date for evacuation nor submit any plans. The only instructions from his Government he had received were to get his troops under discipline.On August 1st Von der Goltz addressed his men at a parade that they must be prepared to lea\re Courland. Those who remained behind would be in a precarious position.As German troops in Bermont&apos;s Corps were all volunteers he said that he has no authority over them.Conference of States.  Colonel  Tallents  reported on September  Sth that&apos; a &apos; conference was to be held at Riga. on the 10th between the representatives of Esthonia, Latvia and Lithuania for the purpose of discussing the possibility of an alliance betAveen those States.CHINA.Tibet Frontier Question. Sir J. Jordan has had an unsatisfactory interview Avith the President. The latter postulated three conditions which, he asserted, the Govern-.ment considered necessary for the conclusion of the negotiations : (1) Consultation at
Peking with the representatives of the province of Szeehuen ; (2) Parliament to be -kept informed of the progress of the negotiations ; (3) Agreement to be submitted to Parliament before signature. He refused, however, to give any definite assurance that the negotiations would be continued. Sir J. Jordan states that the President is in the hands of the militarists, who are themselves under Japanese influence, and he has obtained fresh proof that the negotiations broke down owing to their machinations.CZECHO-SLOVAKP\.Rapprochement with Germany. Mr. Gosling learns from a reliable source that the Social Democratic Party favours a rapprochement with Germany and that this policy may have to be reckoned with in the future.FINLAND.The Bed Legion. Negotiations still continue on the repatriation of the Red Legion to Finland. It is now proposed to intern the Legion on an island off the Esthonian coast pending a decision as to its ultimate disposal (Sir C. Kennard, September 9th).FRANCE.The Question of Syria. In the course of his speesh in the Chamber on September 2nd on the Peace Treaty and in referring to the security given to France by the Anglo-American Alliance M. Louis Barthou made the following statement :-&quot; These alliances jnust be acted upon and let us speak frankly as is our duty. England must not refuse us the legitimate satisfactions to which we are entitled. . . . I do not wish to speak of what is happening in Persia : but it is our duty to say to the Government that in Syria events are taking place of such gravity that the Chamber and France cannot permit things to continue as they are. There is the agreement with England of 1916. England has contracted engagements with us. . . . The British Government has made in regard to Syria declarations the sincerity of which I do not wish to place in doubt; but all of you on the Ministers&apos; bench are well aware how these declarations and intentions are daily nullified by acts which we cannot accept in the name of France.&quot; Yes, we welcome the alliance with England, but we should like to see it complete, loyal and practical.&quot;   (Sir Gf. Grahame, September 3rd.)Meanwhile the Press continues to discuss the arrest of Emir Said and the Temps now accuses the British authorities of arresting Moujdel Bey in consequence of his desire for French protection of Syria. The article complains that the arrest of the chief of an illustrious family, known for his cordial feelings for France, is most harmful to her from the point of view of her prestige in the eyes of the Arabs, and adds that the American Mission appear to have been duped and not to have realised the strength of the feeling for France in Syria.The editor of La Liberte, a widely-read evening Paris newspaper, signs a strongly-worded article about Syria to the effect that it is well that the British should honour Foch, but it would be still better if they would not plunder Foch&apos;s country. The French have shown disinterestedness up to the extreme limit. That limit has now been reached if not overstepped. The whole of France is behind the French Govern-ment in the Syrian question for the maintenance rf her rights. The British army was able to succeed in the Palestine campaign owing to British troops being taken away for the purpose from the French front and for which France had to substitute her own (Sir G. Grahame, September 2nd).A Renter telegram from London has been published in Pails to the effect that Emir Said was arrested with the concurrence of the Chief French Administrator at Beirut (Sir G. Grahanie, September 4th).England and Egypt. In the debate on the Peace Treaty the Socialist Deputy, M. Goude, protested against the British protectorate over Egypt, which he said France was being made to recognise by an oblique procedure through the ratification of a treaty obliging Germany to recognise it. He quoted from the declarations of Mr. Gladstone and Lord Salisbury at the time of the Fashoda incident (when France Avas
askecl to retire from Egyptian not British territory) as showing that England had always admitted Egyptian independence ; also from the speech by Monsieur de Freycinet in 18SG to the effect that the definite establishment of a Great Power in Egypt would be a severe blow to French influence in the Mediterranean, to which Prance should never agree. Now France was joining in action which would drive the Egyptians to violence and revolution, the only resource left to them. He referred to &quot; atrocities,&quot; shootings, massacres. He said that the Egyptian army had been used to occupy the Hedjaz, where a king had been created by England in order to have another vote at the Conference. This king, representing only nomad tribes, had been allowed to sign a treaty imposing a protectorate on the neighbouring people of Egypt. He concluded that he was sure the British people would soon join the French people in repudiating the traditions of the British bourgeoisie and repairing this crime (Sir G. G rahame, September 5th).GERMANY.The Allies&apos; Note on Union with Austria. According to a Nauen report of September 3rd, the whole German Press devotes considerable attention to the Note which, according to Entente newspapers, has been sent by the Supreme Council to the German Government, demanding the removal from the German Constitution of the provisions referring to a possible union of German-Austria with the German State. The German newspapers are at a loss to discover any discrepancy between the terms of the German Constitution and those of the Peace Treaty.Writing on this subject in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, Professor Heilfron deals with the juridicial side of the question. Professor Heilfron declares that Germany has no intention whatever of encroaching upon German-Austria&apos;s inde-pendence. Only in the event of German-Austria&apos;s decision to unite with Germany, with the consent of the Council of the League of Nations, would the provisions in question enter into force without necessitating a change in the Constitution. The fact that German-Austria^ representatives are already to have a consultative voice is clue to the desire, which German-Austria has already expressed, to participate in the German Reichsrat. The demand of the Entente that the Constitution should be changed within 15 days is unanimously rejected by the German newspapers, on the ground that a Constitutional Government cannot of itself undertake any changes whatsoever.Upper Silesia. A Wireless report (September 5th) states that the strike agitators in Upper Silesia are again endeavouring to bring about the cessation of work in the mines. According to unconfirmed reports, a few workers have already yielded to the agitators and ceased work. They demand the unimpeded return of the insurgents who took refuge in Poland. The negotiations with the strikers in Dombrova have led to the resumption of work.Economic Relations with Finland.. The Swedish Press reproduces a statement in the Finnish Press that an Association has been formed in Berlin to continue the activities of the Finnish Section of the &quot; German-Russian Association &quot; in maintaining economic relations between Germany and Finland. The Association has its own Press organ (Mr. Ramsay, September 3rd).Situation in Bavaria. -Sir H. Rumbold sends the following information from Berne :  &quot; The German Minister, who is himself a Bavarian, recently informed a well-known Austrian journalist here that he had received very bad news from Munich, which led him to fear that a fresh Spartacist outbreak is imminent there.&quot;Russian Prisoners to fight Bolsheviks. According to information given to Mr. Gosling (Prague) by Professor Masaryk, the Germans have drilled and fully equipped 25,000 Russian prisoners for the purpose of fighting the Bolsheviks.HUNGARY.Reconstruction of the Cabinet. As a consequence of the refusal of Heinfich&apos;s friends to accept certain engagements undertaken by him without the consent of the Entente, he has irrevocably renounced his  plan of forming a  Cabinet even if
the Entente give their consent. (The composition of the proposed Cabinet was given in a Wireless message from Budapest, dated September 2nd). Friedrich has in consequence decided to remodel the Ministry by bringing into it Socialists who were not compromised with Bela Kun, and other elements distinctly entento-phil under the leadership of &quot;Varjassy. The latter, having obtained satisfaction from Friedrich on.* certain points on Avhich they were at variance, has promised to support him (Budapest, September 4th).West Hungary. According to a German Wireless report (September 6th), Count Sigray, the Hungarian Government Commissary for AVest Hungary, informed the Government Commissary for Odenburg that the Treaty to be concluded between the Entente and German-Austria was not to be regarded as binding, as the Hungarian Government had not yet concluded any corresponding agreements. The Hungarian Government would oppose and prevent by force of arms an occupation of German West Hungary. At the same time a. complete blockade would be established between West Hungary and German-Austria in order to prevent German-Austrians from entering West-Hungarian territory.Relations with Serbia. Sir C. des Graz (Belgrade) reports that. M. Lovaszy, who is in charge o&quot;. foreign relations in the new Government of Hungary, has sent Andreas Shnrmezey as emissary to the Serbian Government.The Hungarian Government expresses its urgent desire to conclude a defensive and offensive alliance as well as to enter into close economic union with Serbia.The Emissary makes grievous complaints against looting by Rumanians, and their efforts to bring Hungaiy into subjection to themselves. The one wish of the Hungarian Government is that the Rumanians should withdraw behind the line of demarcation.The answer given by the Serbian Government to Sharmezey has been to show sympathy, and to counsel the Hungarian Government to submit its proposals to the Paris Conference.Allies&apos; Note to Rumania. The following message was sent from Budapest on September 3rd addressed to M. Antonescti, Paris, with the request that he should give it publicity- in the Foreign Press : &quot; It is officially stated that the Note of August 23rd, mentioned in the Press communiques, which the Peace Conference is stated to have sent to Rumania, has not yet been received by the Rumanian Government up to mid-day September 2nd &quot; (Budapest, September 2nd).JAPAN.Attempted Assassination at Seoul. Mr. Alston reported on September 3rd that an unsuccessful attempt was made to assassinate the new Governor-General on his arrival at Seoul.Japanese Policy in China. In an interview with His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on September 1st, the Japanese Ambassador stated that the Govern-ment accepted and confirmed the resolutions adopted at the meetings of the representatives of the Bankers&apos; groups held in Paris on May 11th and 12th with regard to the organisation of an International Consortium for financial business in China, provided, however, that this acceptance and confirmation should not be held or construed to operate to the prejudice of the special rights and interests possessed hy Japan in Southern Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia.The Ambassador entered upon a lengthy argument concerning the political and economic claims of Japan with regard to those regions which was based partly upon geographical propinquity, partly on the sacrifices endured by Japan in her two wars and partly on the necessity of setting up a barrier against the possibility of renewed aggression in Far Eastern Asia, either by a recovered Russia or a recovered Germany. Fie contended that just as Southern Manchuria was essential to the protection of the Japanese possessions or leases in Korea and the Liaotung Peninsula, so Eastern Mongolia, as the hinterland of Southern Manchuria with its rivers flowing into the same sea and with identical economic resources, was also an essential part of the-Japanese sphere (Foreign Office, September 4th).
NETHERLANDS.The Negotiations with Belgium. Mr. Robertson telegraphed on September 3rd - that the Hutch delegates were exjjected to leave for Paris on September 5th. He believed that they were authorised to make considerable concessions with regard to the Scheldt and the canals. He drew attention, however, to three points : (1) the Dutch refused to admit Belgian &quot; rights &quot; and regarded these concessions as an act of grace on their part; (2) the attitude of the Belgian Government and Extremist Press forbade the- establishment of a military convention for the combined defence of Limburg; (3) the Dutch refused to discuss any interference with their sovereign rights or- the transfer of territory.SERBIA, AND SERB-CROAT-SLOVENE KINGDOM.Reconstruction of the Government. Negotiations are said to be progressing favourably towards the formation of a Coalition Government, a step which was deemed necessary owing to the smailness of the new Governments majority (Sir C. des Graz, August 20th).Fiume. According to the Admiralty Weekly Report, No. 37 (August 30th), a new solution of the Fiume question is now under consideration. It is proposed that the Western portion of the town and harbour works should become Italian, while the Eastern portion should be internationalised, thus constituting a free port for Jugo-Slavia. By this arrangement most of the town would go to Italy, together with sufficient harbour works for local needs, while the Baross Harbour at the eastern extremity of the town, would amply suffice for the needs of Jugo-Slavia. It is said that the Italians are prepared to accept this solution.Belgrade-Sofia Railway opened. Sir C. des Graz reports that through railway and telegraphic communication has been established between Belgrade and Sofia via Nish and Pirot, thus making connection with the ports of Dedeagatch, Bourgas, Varna, and Constantinople.THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.The League of Nations. -Mr. Lindsay reports that the Senate Committee have completed the draft of the resolution for the ratification of the Peace Treaty, including four reservations as follows : (1) The United States reserve the unconditional right of withdrawal from the League on notice being given as provided for in Article 1.(2) The United States decline to assume any obligation under Article 10 or other-articles for the protection of any country and will not accept any mandate except by action of Congress.(3) The right to decide what are domestic questions is exclusively reserved to the United States, and all the domestic affairs of the United States are declared solely within the jurisdiction of the United States and not subjected in any way by the Treaty to the League of Nations.(4) The United States decline to submit to the League of Nations any question - depending on or relating to the Monroe doctrine which is declared wholly outside the jurisdiction of the League and unaffected by the Treaty.In addition to the above reservations, the amendments previously adopted by the Committee will come before the Senate. These include the grant to the United States of six votes in the League ; the Shantung amendment; and the amendment to prevent nations participating in consideration by the League Council of questions in which they themselves are concerned.One of the democratic Senators in the Committee voted with Republicans on the reservations.
Signature of the Peace Treaty with Austria. Mr Balfour telegraphs from Par is that the Treaty of Peace with Austria was signed on the morning of September 10th at Saint Germain. The Rumanian and Serb-Croat-Slovene Plenipotentiaries did not sign owing to their objections to the Article of the Treaty dealing with the protection of Minorities. A special Protocol has, however, been prepared, whereby the Treaty can be signed up to September 13th by any of the Powers who did not sign on September 10th.Peace with Germany. W.C.P. 1269.
