The Supreme Economic Council has taken action for the revictualling of Germany (pages 2 and 0). Difficulties about the revictualliug of Serbia are explained on page 4.Extracts from the Home Secretary&apos;s latest report on Bolshevism in countries dealt with in this Report are given in an Appendix. There are later reports under Germany (page 7), where a National Union for combating . Bolshevism has been established, and under Switzerland (page 9). Speaking generally, Bolshevism is thriving only where its seeds fall upon favourable soil ; its spreading depends upon the power controlling the armed forces of the State, and the discipline and loyalty to the controlling authority of such forces. Sir H. Rumbold furnishes reliable evidence that the -military and Junker element dominates the Government in Germany, and the National Assembly owes its continued existence to armed force.Allied Countries.China (page 3). Japan does not see eye to eye with the Allies about collective action.France (page 3). The Government will not grant passports to the Socialist . delegation to Russia.Italy (page 4).

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Bolshevism. Extracts from a report issued by the Home Secretary are given in an Appendix to this Report.The subject is also referred to under &quot; Germany,&quot; &quot; Baltic Provinces,&quot; and &quot; Switzerland (Political Situation).&quot;Food Relief. The Food Section of the Supreme Economic Council has instructed its representatives at Rotterdam that delivery of foodstuffs to Germany may commence as soon as the Consul-General has received the first consignment of gold (Mr. Balfour, March .15th).At the request of the Food Section the Blockade Council agreed on March 12th to export from (a) Norway to Poland. Esthonia, Austria, and Germany 7,500 tons of fats of norwegian origin, prepared from fish oil, &amp;c.(b) Copenhagen to Czecho-Slovakia 150 wagons of fish.Both the above will be forwarded under the procedure for import into Germany (Mr. Balfour, March 13th).Relaxation of Trade Restrictions. With regard to the renewal of commercial relations between the United Kingdom and the occupied territories of Germany proposals are being discussed for the passage of goods through Holland free of the restrictions imposed under the Netherlands Oversea Trust Agreement, and for inducing the Netherlands Government to open the Rhine for this trade (Lord Derby, March 12th).The Superior Blockade Coimcil at a meeting on March 15th passed the following resolution : &quot;That goods on the Free List prepared by the Associated Governments for Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland and Switzerland be permitted to go freely to individuals or firms whose names appear upon the confidential Black Lists of the Associated Governments for all other countries for which there are Enemy Trade Lists, other than the five above-mentioned neutrals &quot; (Mr. Balfour, March 17th).The Supreme Economic Council has decided to submit to the Supreme War Council proposals for raising the blockade of Austria and Hungary subject to certain conditions of control with regard to re-export to Germany.German Shipping. His Majesty&apos;s representatives in neutral countries have been informed that an agreement was reached at Brussels on March 14th by which the German Government is to notify neutral Governments that German vessels in neutral ports are to be placed at the disposal of the Associated Governments.Aviation Commission. A j)proposal is being considered by the Supreme War Council for the representation of Belgium, Brazil, Greece, Rumania, Serbia, Portugal and Brazil on the Aviation Commission (Foreign Office, March 18th).Spotted Typhus. Sir Ii. Rumbold learns that according to Count Max Thun, the representative of the Ukrainian Red Cross, spotted typhus is pandemic throughout Ukraine and Serbia, while there are many cases in Vienna, where it has been brought by prisoners returning from Russia. Count Max Thun is organising Committees in Vienna, Cracow and Bucla-Pesth for the purpose of arresting the progress of the disease westwards.   He hopes that help will be forthcoming from the Allied Powers.ALLIED  GROUP.BELGIUM.Belgian Affairs. A Memorandum (G.T. 0991) has been issued by the Political Intelligence Department, and. deals with the following matters : Economic Difficulties,
Political Affairs, Electoral Reform, the Language Question, Belgium and the Peace Conference, the Belgian Press on Belgian Claims, Belgian Socialists and Demobilisation.CHINA.Peace Conference at Shanghai. Sir J. Jordan reported (March 14th) that the Japanese Ciovernment could not accept die wording of the proposed collective repre-sentation to the Chinese President (see Western and General Report No. 110, page 2), and had submitted an alternative proposal, of which a resume is given.- This proposal was considered by the Allied Ministers, and rejected by the British, French and United States representatives.Railways. The proposal for the unification and nationalisation of all railways in China is being strongly criticised. The opponents of the project fear that any reform of such a nature would entail loss of power, patronage and profits for the Chiaotung jiarty. The agitation has resulted in instructions to the Chinese Delegates to the Peace Conference to try to retain complete freedom of control for Chinese on present Chinese Government Railways, while endeavouring to secure the support of the PoAvers for the redemption of alienated railways by a Joint Commission, and for the application of principles of unification to future rail\Arays. Sir J. Jordan (March 14l.li) regards this compromise as impracticable.Repatriation of Chinese Coolies. His Majesty&apos;s Government has requested Sir J. Jordan to express an opinion as to Avhether the coolies from Russia, if repatriated, would be able to cause trouble by disseminating Bolshevik propaganda or hy starting rebellions against the Chinese Government. Pending receipt of such opiuion, it is not proposed to take further action in the matter, especially as the War Office strongly opposes their return (Foreign Office, March .18th).CUBA.Labour Unrest.- Mr. CoAvan reported (March 12th) that the strike Avas still in progress, and that a shooting affray, in which a few were killed and Avounded, had occurred betAveen the police and strikers.FRANCE.Franco-German Frontier. M. Barthou publishes a denial of the statement made in Humanite and referred to in Western Report No. 110, page 8, as to his interview with M. Clemenceau relatiA-e to the annexation of the Left Bank of the Rhine, to Avhich he is opposed (Lord Derby, March 12th).Press Articles. Lord Derby drew attention (March 12th) to an article in Temps Jtrvouring the internationalisation of Kiel Canal and expressing the hope that Heligoland will be restored to Great Britain. With regard to the Duchies of SchlesAvig-Holstein, it asserts that it would be only natural to form the German population of those proAdnees into an independent and neutral State under guarantee of the League of Nations. M. Herve, in Victoire of same date, describes the adoption of the British proposal for the composition of future German Army as sounding the knell of the system of conscription everyAvhere. The French Press announces that the Industrial Society of lYlulhouse has petitioned the French Government to provide in the Peace Treaty that all motor power  of the Rhine between Bale and Strassbourg shall be reserved exclusively for France, and that the frontier shall be the right bank of the river (Lord Derby, March 11th).Attention is also drawn (March 14th) to an article by M. Gauvain in Journal des Debats, commenting on the Italian memorandum respecting the territorial claims of that country ; to an article in Temps (March 15th) adopting a very sympathetic attitude toAvarcls the Italian claims, and (March 15th) to M. Herve&apos;s article in Victoire Avarnirig the Government against French Imperialism.Socialist Delegation to Russia. Lord Derby reported (March 15th) that the announcement is made that the French GoA^erunient has declined to grant passports to Socialists delegated by the International Congress to proceed to Russia to report on the political and economic situation there.
ITALY.lielea.sc of Non-Italian Prisoners in Tripoli (Misurala). The British naval action in releasing British and Greek prisoners at Misurata without first consulting the Italian Government (see Western Report No. LOS, page 3) is still the subject of representations to His Majesty&apos;s Government by the Italian Government (Foreign Oiiice telegram, March 13th).JAPAN.Disturbance at Fusan.-The British Consul at Fusau reported (March 11th) a disturbance at Fusan, without violence, in which some girls and native teachers of Australian Presbyterian Mission took part. Two Australian ladies were arrested in Connection with the incident but were released on March 13th (Sir C. Greene, March 15th).Japanese-American Relations. According to Sir .1. Jordan (March 13th) serious-rioting has occurred at Tientsin between Japanese aud American soldiers, owing to Japanese annoyance at anti-Japanese articles in the American papers.   The military commanders on both sides are taking steps to prevent further trouble.Lord Reading stated (March- 15th) that a speech, made in New York by the Japanese Ambassador, has attracted great attention. Viscount Ishii made a strong-plea for the inclusion in the proposed covenant of the League of Nations of some provision against racial discrimination, and pointed out that this question had been a cause of international discord in the past and would continue to be so in the future unless steps were taken to eliminate it.PORTUGAL.Monarchy proclaimed. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Oporto reported (March ISth) that the military have proclaimed a Monarchy there and that the situation is quiet. A provisional Junta has been formed and the Minister for Foreign Affairs is Luiz Magalbaes, who was Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1907. The composition of the junta is regarded as being very satisfactory;SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Re-vicliutlliug of Serbia-. Representations have been made to Sir C. des Graz (March 11th) that as communication with Salonika is not yet re-established, and the Adriatic ports are closed to the new kingdom of the Serbians, Croats, and Slovenes, it is impossible either to re-victual Serbia, or to re-establish the recently*authorised commercial relations with Great Britain and France.Albania and Montenegro. According to a Foreign Office telegram to Sir C. des Graz (March 17th) very serious reports have been received of conditions on the frontiers of Albania and Montenegro. Several towns have been the scenes of terrorism and murder by Serbian troops and Serbian agents, and His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Belgrade has been instructed to act in concert with his French, Italian, and United States colleagues in addressing a strong warning to the Serbian Government.Italian Minister at Belgrade. Sir C. des Graz reported (March Oth) that the Government would not recognise the new Italian Minister at Belgrade as his letters of credence are addressed to the King of Serbia and not to the Ring of the Serbians, Croats, and Slovenes.UNITED STATES.Independence of Philippine Islands. The British Consul at Manila reported (March. 11th) that an extraordinary Mission left for Washington on February 22nd. The Philippine&quot; Islands Legislature adopted joint resolutions on March 4th and March Sth, instructing the Independence Commission to seek the completion of independence.Irish Questions. In connection with St. PatriclFs Day celebrations, mass meetings were held in Washington and New York, at which resolutions favouring the Republican cause in Ireland were adopted. The Senate of Colorado has passed a resolution requesting the Peace Conference to secure self-determination for Ireland.
ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.German-Austria. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Prague has received a statement containing Professor Masaryk&apos;s views on the future of German-Austria. Professor Masaryk does not think that the majority of the population favours union with Germany, hut the question largely depends on tlie future of Prussia and the survival of Prussianism in the new Germany. Hanover and the Rhine Provinces are mentioned as possible autonomous States. Austria, on her part, is not likely to provoke Pan-Germanism, though some sort of rapprochement with Germany is to he expected.The Czech Government is in a position to exert influence in favour of an independent Austria because (1) Austria depends on Bohemia for coal and partly for food and raw materials ; (2) the Czechs need free transit westwards through Austria ; (3) to a certain extent the indexiendencc of Austria would be in the interest of the German minorities in the neighbouring non-German States.Professor Masaryk draws attention to the lack of a settled Allied policy and the difficulties which this entails for the Czech Government. Finally, he alludes to the economic and political community of interest with regard to Austrian policy between the Czech and Swiss Governments.Czecho--Slovahia and Poland, Mr. Gosling (Prague) learns that the Inter-Allied Commission at Warsaw intends to lodge a protest at Paris against the failure of the Czech Government to fulfil the terms of the Teschen Agreement. Complaint is made that (1) there has been no delivery of coal from Bohemia ; (2) the Czechs have interrupted telegraph communication between Warsaw and Vienna and Vienna and Cracow ; (3) the frontier has been closed against munition trains for Poland.Alleged Austro-German Conspiracy. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Prague reported on March 12th that he had been handed documents by the Czech Govern-ment purporting to prove Austro-German complicity in a plot to invade Bohemia (vide Report No. 110, page 1). The Czecho-Slovak Government has addressed a note to the Allied Governments requesting Allied control of Austro-German railways and the reduction of the Austro-German army to a minimum. It is stated that tbe incriminating documents were found through the arrest of a courier from Berlin. The Supreme War Council has deferred action pending examination of the documents and investigation on the spot by the Commission at Teschen (Foreign Office, March 13th).GERMANY.Political Situation.- (1) General. Sir H. Rumbold has received information as to the views held by Professor Nicolai, the German heart-specialist, and Herr Bernstein, the former Minority Socialist, on the subject of the situation in Germany since the revolution. They consider that the countryis still ruled by the military and Junker element which dominates the Ebert-Scbeidemann Government. The National Assembly owes its continued existence to armed force. The strikes are not so much due to the want of food or employment as to disappointment in the Socialist Govern-ment, which was expected to herald in the millenium. Owing to high wages, manufacturers are obliged to close down their works, and as a result the country is drifting into Bolshevism. As an immediate remedy Germany should be allowed to import food which must be controlled by the Allies. Otherwise the party controlling the food supplies would also control the political situation (Sir If. Rumbold, March 12th).Sir C. Marling (Copenhagen) learns that at a recent meeting held in Berlin by Governmental authorities, Herr Noske declared that the position in Germany was desperate. Disturbances might be temporarily suppressed, but he predicted that the ultimate union of Spartacists and Russian Bolsheviks was inevitable. The establish-ment of a military dictatorship under Herr Noske and General von Lettow-Yorbeck was suggested.Sir IT. Rumbold learns through the Swiss Minister at Berlin that a movement is on foot in political circles for getting rid of Herr Scheidemann. Count Brockdorff-Rantzau is mentioned as a possible successor.(2) Prussia. The Constituent Prussian Diet has met. Herr Hirsch has been elected Minister-President, lierr Leinert (Majority Socialist) President of the Diet,7570^3!) b
Dr. Porsch (Centre) and Dr. Frehtzel (Democrat) Vice-Presidents. A draft Bill for the establishment of the Prussian Constitution has been published (German Wireless, March 13th and 15th).Martial law has been introduced in certain districts in East and West Prussia, and also over large areas of Bittenfeld and Merseburg (Prussian Saxony) (Ger :ian Wireless, March 16th).(3) Berlin. The suburbs have been occupied by Government troops, and order appears to be restored.   Martial law has been suspended.The Government has been transferred from Weimar to Berlin.(4) Silesia. The strike movement has ended for the present, though a further outbreak is expected (German Wireless, March 15th).(5) Ruhr District. The strike continues (March 17th).(6) Kiel. In elections to the Workmen&apos;s Council the Majority Socialists obtained 15 seats, the bourgeoisie 11, and the Independent Socialists 4 (German Wireless, March 18th).(7) Bavaria. The State Assembly met on March 17th. Herr Hoffmann (Majority Socialist) was unanimously selected as Prime Minister. The Independent Socialists are reported to have broken the Party agreement and to have formulated their own demands for the dictatorship of the proletariat under the leadership of the Councils. They have refused to participate in the formation of the Cabinet.According to a Munich telegram Herr Hoffmamis Cabinet is composed as follows :-Prime Minister, Foreign Affairs and Public Worship   -   Herr Hoffmann. Justice -----   Herr Endres.Interior ------   Herr Werkel.Communications - Herr Frauendorffer.Social A flairs   - - - - - -   Herr Unterleitner.Agriculture    - &apos; - - - -   herr Steiner.Military Affairs -----   Herr Schnepfenhurst.Trade and Industry       - - - Herr Simon.Food Situation. A Report (G.T. 6967) has been drawn rip by Sir John Beale on Relief Supplies for Germany. The gravity of the food situation as shown by various reports (vide previous General and Western Reports) is emphasised. Sir John Beale is of opinion that the Supreme Economic Council should provide for a minimum supply of 200,000 tons of breadstuffs and 100,000 tons of fats with an increase in this amount if possible. Difficulties relating to finance (payment by Germany) and tonnage (shortage and priority of Allies) are alluded to. The settlement of preliminary peace terms which will allow the blockade to be raised is suggested.The following announcement appears in the German Wireless Report of March 17th :-&quot; The agreement about food supplies was signed in Brussels on Saturday. As soon as the ships are ready for sea and payment is arranged the first delivery of 270,000 tons will be made. Further, Germany is entitled to buy every month up to 70,000 tons of fats and 300,000 tons of grain or its equivalent in other human foods. This may be bought from America, the Entente, or neutrals. Import of fish from European countries and of vegetables is not included in the figures. Fishery restrictions in the Baltic are removed. Payment for each delivery is to be made in advance. Territory on the right and left banks of the Rhine will be treated equally as regards food supply. Germany is to permit the transport of food by her harbours and canals to the Czecho-Slovaks. In order to make it possible to procure food the Associated Governments will facilitate communications between Germany and abroad. A permanent Commission will sit in Rotterdam to deal with trade and other questions arising out of the agreement.&quot; Beyond the first 270,000 tons the Associated Governments do not undertake delivery, but give Germany permission to import from abroad at the rate of 370,000 tons a month.The Centre Party. According to an article which appeared in Germania on March 6th, the Centre Party, while realising that capitalism has had its day and looking with sympathy ou the idea of an economic democracy, will not consent to surrender of political rights to the Councils.
Bolshevism. The following announcement appears in the German Wireless Report of March ISth : &quot; The newly founded German National Union against Bolshevism desires to gather together all Germans, without party distinction, and to organise them for the fight against Bolshevism. The aim of the Union is to create an anti-Bolshevik national defence force. The Union has for collaborators the German officers who organised Finland and the Finnish nation in its successful repulse of Bolshevism.&quot;Czech Relations. A Wireless report dated March loth states that the attitude of the Czechs towards Saxony has not been clearly explained. The protection of the Saxon frontier is being strengthened continuously.German Wireless Reports. The usual complaints continue to be made with regard to the annexation of the Saar Valley by France, the &quot; dismemberment&quot; of Germany, Polish aggression, the starvation of Germany, inclusion within the League of Nations, Peace terms and President Wilson&apos;s fourteen points.NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.The Tort Strike. Sir R. Tower reports that he has had an interview with President Irigoyen who expressed. sympathy with the workmen. The Presidents suggestion that the strikers should receive pay for the period of the lock-out was not agreed to by the Shipping Associations. The Government has signified its intention of declaring the entire port of Buenos Ayres under official control from March 17th. On March 15th the United States Ambassador received instructions to make repre-sentations to the President (Sir R. Tower, March 15th). The Ambassador is of the opinion that support of the shipping companies&apos; demands for guarantees against boycott (vide Report No. 110, page 7) or action in the form of joint representations might be interpreted by the Government and people as an interference with the sovereignty of the Republic (Lord Reading, March 15th).Latest reports state that the strikers have rejected the companies&apos; proposals, the outstanding difficulty now being the question of pay during the period of the lock-out.BALTIC  PROVINCES.Military Situation. (1) Livonia. West of Pskov the Bolsheviks claim the capture of Petchori and a number of villages (Russian Wireless, March I4th). Further west they were forced to abandon Neuhausen (March 16th). A telegram from Copenhagen (March 17th) states that both on this front and in the region of Marienburg Esthonian and Finnish troops have launched successful counter-attacks. The latest Russian reports (March ISth) state that the enemy were repelled on all fronts and claim further advances in the direction of Valk and Petchori.(2) Courland. Operations are proceeding successfully. To the south the Bolsheviks are retiring along the Muravevo-Mitau railway and have reached a point 25 versts south of Mitau (Russian Wireless, March 10th). To the north Tukkurn (37 miles west of Riga) has been captured, and the retreat of the Bolshevik forces operating immediately east of Windau has thus been cut off (Libau, March 16 th).Allied Policy. Attention is drawn to an Admiralty Memorandum (G.T. 6969), signed by Admiral Fremantle, on the necessity for framing a policy with regard to the Baltic Provinces. Comment is made upon the danger of a Bolshevik attack, both by land and sea, in the spring, upon the need for the presence of responsible Allied representatives on shore, and upon the status of the 12,000 German troops, which, though behaving as an army of occupation, at present constitute the only defence against the Bolsheviks.
Union with Rttssia. According to Mr. Menning considerable apprehension is felt with regard to the publication of a telegram from Paris to the effect that the Russian Committee has determined to re-unite Finland and the Baltic Provinces with Russia. Esthonian soldiers are under-the impression that they are fighting for independence (Sir C. Marling, March 12th).Trade. The re-opening of trade with Lithuania and Latvia is under con-si deration.DENMARK.The Schleswig Question. Members of a farmers&apos; deputation from Schleswig have Adsited the British Embassy at Copenhagen. Their object was to urge the occupation of Flensborg, Schleswig, and Husum hy Allied troops as a means of preventing requisitions at unfair prices which they allege are ruining farmers especially in South Schleswig. They also requested to send representatives to England for the purchase of bulls and suggested that permission to do this would be useful in promoting pro-British feeling.FINLAND.Socialist Manifesto. A manifesto has been published in the Politiken (Sweden) from the Finnish and Socialist Committee to the German Spartacus Group, declaring that the Finnish Red Party intends to start a revolution against the Finnish Government.MEXICO.Press Attach on Carranza. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Mexico reports that violent attacks are being made against Carranza and his administration in certain sections of the Press.Arms.-According to Press reports the Mexican Ambassador at Washington has been successful in gaining permission for the acquisition of arms and ammunition in the United States and their importation into Mexico subject to notification that they are intended for the use of the Mexican Government (Mr. Cummins, March 16th). Mr. Cummins regrets that this permission has been granted, though he does not think Carranza will confiscate the revenues of the oilfields owing to fear of American occupation (March 12th). Campaigns against Villa and Pelaez have been started, and it is believed that this has been made possible by the importation of arms. Villa is also reported to have received arms across the border. On March 12th the rebels captured the State of Michcacan (Mr. Cummins, March 12th and 13th).NETHERLANDS.Export of Herrings. Sir W. Townley has been informed that no objection need be raised to the re-export of Norwegian herrings from Holland to Alsace-Lorraine and the Left Bank of * the Rhine subject to control similar to that exercised over the importation of British herrings.SPAIN.Enemy Shipping. The management of enemy passenger and cargo ships in Spanish ports is being undertaken by French authorities on behalf of the Associated Governments (Foreign Office, March 14th).On March 18th Sir A. Hardinge reported that the -condition with regard to the flying of the Inter-Allied -flag had been accepted by the Spanish Government.
Exports to Greece. The removal of all restrictions on Spanish exports to Greece is being considered by the British Government (Foreign Office, March 13th).Situation at Barcelona. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Barcelona reports that martial law was declared on the morning of March 13th. Soldiers are collecting tramway fares and military aid is being given to several companies.The strikers have formulated their demands, which include universal reinstate-ment and the payment of 50,000 pesetas as indemnit3r to the strikers.&apos;   SWEDEN.Aland Islands. According to the Swedish Press, while the Aland Island delegates to tile Peace Conference have been forbidden to leaA^e by the Finnish authorities pending a decision as to whether they are to be charged with high treason, two Finnish representatives have been chosen to put Finland&apos;s Anew of the Aland Island question before the Conference. Mr. Clive fears the effect of this action upon Swedish public opinion and suggests that passports to England for the Finnish representatives should be withheld until the proceedings against the Aland delegates are abandoned.SWITZERLAND.Political Situation. A Memorandum (G.T. 6990) on the recent political crisis in Switzerland has been issued hy the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office. After alluding to the salutary effect produced by the collapse of the general strike in November, the Memorandum shows that a tendency towards moderation is indicated by (I) the choice of moderate and opportunist Berne in preference to Zurich, where the pro-BolsheArik element is predominant, for the headquarters of the Swiss Social Democratic Party; (2) the election of Gustav Midler, a Moderate, to the presidency of the Party ; (3) the resignation of Platten. the leader of the BolsheATik section of the Party ; (1) the prevalence of opportunist and moderate opinion at the Swiss Labour Congress.On the other hand, Bolshevik resolutions with a programme of class-war as opposed to the International Socialist Conference were passed at an extraordinary Party Congress of the Social Democrats on February 2nd, and Midler resigned his place being taken by the extremist Reinhard. The Party is therefore practically com-mitted to Bolshevism, though its polic3^ at present has only stimulated anti-Bolshe\Tik and anti-general strike measures.The Memorandum further deals with the union of German-Austria and Germany, and the danger for Switzerland of a &quot; Grossdeutschland.&quot; The annexation of Voralberg by Germany is A&apos;iewed with eA7en greater apprehension.The last point dealt with is Switzerland&apos;s place in a League of Nations, and the incompatibility between the maintenance of neutrality and participation in the League. This could be overcome by (1) full recognition by the League of Swiss neutrality as defined by tlie Congress of A7ienna ; (2) the acceptance of economic action as Switzerland&apos;s contribution to the executive force of the League; (3) the establishment of the League&apos;s headquarters in Switzerland.Recognition of Governments. Recognition of the Czecho-Slovak and Polish Governments has been decided upon (Sir 11. Rumbold) March 14th and 15th).Coal. Sir H. Rumbold learns that the first trainload of Belgian coal arrived on March 10th, and that henceforward daily consignments are expected.Ex-Emperor of Austria. Sir H. Rumbold understands that the ex-Emperor will be admitted into the country.7570-36

APPENDIXtoWestern and General Report No. 111.BOLSHEVISM.Extracts from Report circulated by the Home Secretary, dated March 10th, 1919 (G.T. 6976).Summary. During the past fortnight Bolshevism has made progress in Bavaria and other parts of Germain&apos;, and in Austriadlungary. The Governments of Switzer-land, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Holland, Spain and Portugal are actively alive to the danger, and Bolshevism, as a consequence, is not advancing, though there have been disorders in the South of Spain of a Syndicalist nature, in Italy reports seem to show that there is no immediate danger. The most active centres of propaganda at the moment are Denmark and Holland, and, to a lesser degree, Switzerland.France. On the whole the morale of the French during the past fortnight is reported to be good. People are relieved of their anxiety about a fresh outbreak of hostilities, and are pleased at. the idea that the Germans will surrender material intact.The effect of the attack on Monsieur Clemenceau has been to restore his rather waning popularity among all classes but the extreme Socialists, who are carrying on an agitation among the railway workers. Their hostility is implacable, and a week ago, at the Batignolles sheds, an effigy of Monsieur Clemeuceau was put in a coffin and a mock funeral service was held, with cries such as &quot; En voila tin de moins ! &quot; &quot; Vive Caillaux ! &quot; &quot; Cest Caillaux qu&apos;il nous faut ! &quot; and the singing of &quot; lTnternationale.&quot;   The meeting was small.Three persons named Mannilsky, Davtian and a woman named Armand, who landed at Dunkirk with some French citizens repatriated from Russia, as delegates of the Bolshevik Bed Cross, are reported to have brought with them 1,500,000 roubles. The money has been detained by the authorities, pending investigation.Meerheim, addressing a meeting of the Confederation Generale du Travail at Lyons on February 1.5th, while defending the Bolshevik Government in Russia against the charges appearing in the Press, declared that a strike in France would be a. terrible error, and an attempted revolution a ridiculous failure.Switzerland, Flatten, who is of German birth, recently naturalised, and is now the leader of the revolutionary party in Switzerland, has left that country, ostensibly for Russia, but in reality to consult the Spartacist leaders in Germany. (The latest information is that he was arrested at Mannheim, in connection with the Spartacist disturbances.) The Swiss Government willingly let him go, and would have been glad to prevent his return, but they were anxious to do nothing that would give the Socialists the excuse for saying that they were persecuted.A split seems to be developing between the two branches of the Socialists. Grimm is appealing to his followers to separate themselves from Flatten and his Bolshevik policy.Suldatenrate (Soldiers&apos; Councils) are known to exist in the Swiss army.   Each has a small executive council in communication with the central council.On February 14th the National Council considered the spread of revolutionary propaganda among the troops.   A proclamation has been issued prohibiting meetings for undermining military discipline, and providing heavy penalties for the dissemi-nation of false news.   It is hoped that demobilisation will ease the situation, as the  .. men are more difficult to get at wdien they are scattered in their homes.
Dr. Parvus Helphand, when recently arrested, had nothing in his effects to connect him with the Bolsheviks. Whatever his mission may be and it is certainly not friendly to the Allies it is not the spreading of Bolshevik propaganda.The Persian Minister, Zoka-ed-Dowleh, has just arrived in Berne. He came from Berlin, and is reported to be conducting Bolshevik propaganda with funds from Stockholm.Belgium. The situation in Belgium appears to-be a little better, though the recent sporadic strikes seem to be less political than economic in connection with the eight hours&apos; day. It is not thought at present that there will, be any serious outbreak in Antwerp, in spite of the alarmist rumours that have been circulated.Germany. Whatever may have been the policy of the German Government a few Aveeks ago, there is now no doubt that the Government, as well as the German people, are in a state bordering on panic at the progress of Bolshevism. Some weeks ago the strength of the Spartacist group Avas estimated at 2,000,000, of whom 230,000 were deserters ; it must have increased since this estimate was made. The success of the Spartacists in Bavaria has enormously impressed public opinion. Officers belonging to the Junker class have been pressing into the hands of Allied officers brochures pointing out that Germany should be the one bulwark of civilisation against the common danger, but she can only be made so by quick supplies of food and raw material; if she succumbs, they say, the existence of. the remaining European States will be in jeopardy. When due allowance is made for the trickery of German propagandists, there seems no reason to doubt that in this instance the fear is quite genuine and the remedy proposed the only effective one ; at the same time, it is impossible to believe that Bolshevism, triumphant in Germany, coidd ever take the same form as in Russia. The masses are hungry ; their vitality is lowered ; there is little employment and a black future ; in such an atmosphere the first, onset of Bolshevism is bound to have some initial success, but in the end natural stolidity and love of order are bound to make themselves felt.Italy. In political and business circles there are many rumours of Bolshevik agitation. For three days during the week ending March 1st, all the daily newspapers in Rome, except the Socialist organs and the Populo Romano (which employs non-Union labour) were shut down by a strike, and it is said that the National Federation of Labour is threatening the Government Avith a general strike. On the other hand, outside a few fanatics in the Executive Committee of the Official Socialist Party, such as Bombacci and Lazzari, there does not appear to be real Bolshevism.Finland. Bolshevik propaganda in Finland does not appear to be prospering, most of the agitators having been arrested. German influence is said to be increasing, and Mannerheim and Enkel are finding it difficult to maintain their positions.Mr. Gulling, the Chairman of the Bank of Finland and Helsingfors, is a Socialist, and apparently a Bolshevik agent. It is said that at the time of the Bed rising, he. opened the vaults of the bank to the mob.Norway. The extreme Socialists have planned a strike to take place in April 1st,&apos; but the authorities have taken the necessary measures and are not afraid of disorder. Nevertheless, at the instance of the Socialists the proposed State visit of General Mannerheim has been cancelled.There is a report of a secret press for BolsheAnk propaganda at Stavanger, but the authorities are dealing with it.Sircden. The Swedish Government takes what is considered too optimistic a Anew of the danger of Bolshevism ; the expulsion of A&quot;orovski and his mission seems to have allayed all their fears. They know that the Folkeis Dagblad Polltiken is financed with Bolshevik money from Russia, but they are unable to take any steps.Holland. The Government is deporting undesirable Russians through Dantzig, which in the present unsettled state of Poland, is not very satisfactory. The country is said to be swarming with Bolshevik propagandists, particularly Amsterdam and
14 :i    y.Rotterdam. The most dangerous local Bolshevik at. the present momerrf is the Deputy, Wynkoop. A large majority of the working classes are said to he against Bolshevism.Spain. The strike at Barcelona is entirely Syndicalist. The men are anxious to work, but are terrorised. The Captain-General regards the proclamation of a state of siege as the only effective action, but Sehor Romanones declines. It is said that he fears assassination.   The electrical services are maintained by military labour.It. is believed that if the present strike fails, tbe Syndicalists will be beaten. The Government cannot discover the leaders, who are working anonymously, declaring that they want no settlement with the companies, but only the release of all prisoners detained under the Suspended Guarantees.United States. As mentioned in my last report, the authorities in the United States are now taking drastic action against Bolshevik agitators. Among the .54 persons marked for deportation are II British subjects, who are now on their way to this country in ships belonging to the companies that brought them over. The remaining aliens, who cannot at present be deported, are being kept at Ellis Island. It is reported that the Department of Justice has a long list of other leaders whose cases are being considered.A man named Carl Sandberg, who arrived from Christiauia recently, was found to have two drafts of $5,Out) and a quantity of Bolshevik literature. It is thought that the money was supplied to him by Berg, the Bolshevik leader in Christiania.Mexico. Bolshevism appears to have reached Mexico ; centres are reported to have been established in the large towns.t
