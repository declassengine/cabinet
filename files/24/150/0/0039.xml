WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Review of the Foreign Press. An intimation lias been received that the pub-lication of the Review of the Foreign Press (Political, Economic, and Technical), issued by the General Staff, War Office, ceased on August 12th (ALL 7d., Watergate House, Adelphi).Revolutionary Movements Abroad. The Home Office Monthly Review of the Progress of Revolutionary Movements Abroad (No. 10, August 1-lth) states that: &quot; While economic and political unrest has reached the remotest parts of the globe, Communism as a working system has been on the wane.&quot;Full details are given for each country in support of this view, preceded by a short summary, by countries.   Extracts from the summary are given in this report under each of the countries with which the Western Report deals.-League of Nations. The Secretary to the War Cabinet has circulated (G.T.8012) a memorandum from the Secretary-General of the League of Nations on epiestions shortly requiring settlement. The memorandum is reproduced as an Appendix to this Report.Under the heading &quot;Imperial and Foreign Affairs,&quot; the Ministry of Labour, in reporting on Press comments for the week ending on August 13th (G.T. 8000, Secret), called attention to an article in the Neic Statesman discussing the principles under which Mandatory Powers are to administer the territories entrusted to them, and voicing a demand for the attachment to the League of Nations of an institution analogous to our Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, to which appeals against abuses of administration on the part of the Mandatories could be carried.AUSTRIA.Revolutionary Movements. Austrian Communists are reported to have taken to heart the warning of the fall of Bela Ivun (Home Office Report No. 10, August 11th, 1919).The ex-Emperor Charles. On August loth (received 17th) Mr. Gosling reported from Prague on reliable authority a possible movement to place tbe ex-Emperor Charles in power again. This measure would, it is said, be supported by a majority of the people.   (See also &quot; Reports from Serbia,&quot; given under &quot; Hungary.&quot;)THE BALTIC STATES.Latvia. Mr. Grant Watson (August 12th) reported an agreement by the Letts to attack Colonel Bermont&apos;s Russian force, should it move from Mitau upon Dvinsk against the orders of General Yudenich. &quot; Unsatisfactory &quot; reports had reached Riga from Mitau about the considerable number of Germans being joined with the Russian commands. On the same date Mr. Watson predicted an appeal by the Government of Latvia to the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary for help, especially in military equipment and arms.Mr. Ramsay forwarded from Stockholm on the same date a Berlin report that the Lettish Foreign Minister and M. Ulmanis had begun to negotiate for peace with the Bolsheviks.On August 13th Mr. Watson reported the opening on August 12th of the Volksrat session. The Government was likely to be much strengthened by reports of the approaching evacuation of Courland by the Germans. The Government of M. Ulmanis obtained favourable majorities at the opening meetings.On August 15th the appeal from M. Ulmanis to the British Government arrived : &quot; After two and a half months&apos; interruption the Provisional Government of Latvia, with your well-disposed aid and confident of your further support, have
orecovered on July 5th the power of the State in the capital of Latvia, Riga, and has been reconstructed in the form of a Coalition and Labour Cabinet, where the national minorities are widely represented. In the course of five weeks the Coalition Govern-ment, under extraordinary difhculfcies, have done their best to organise their army for the struggle with the enemies of the -whole civilised world, anarchy and Bolshevism, to supply food for the starving population, as well as to secure peace, order, and legitimate power -within the country. However, the Provisional Government of Latvia are powerless to carry out their tasks without your immediate help. Latvia and the Latvian nation, which from the very beginning of tbe war up to the present time have de facto been your most faithful associates, have sacrificed everything within the limits of their weak forces to contribute to the victory. Even to-day the Latvian Army, without arms, without clothing, and without boots and shoes, hold the front against the Bolsheviks. The devastated country sacrifices her last to the war. But the Government are powerless to continue the struggle without arms, ammunitions, money, food and equipment. The Bolsheviks, on the contrary, have money, arms and everything they went. The Latvian. Army cannot keep the front without rifles against machine guns and artillery. The soldiers cannot be kept in the trenches without clothing and barefooted, especially considering the approaching autumn. Without all these means it is impossible to offer efficacious resistance to the increasing propaganda, both at the front and in the rear of the Bolsheviks, and the Russian and German reactionaries sympathising with, each other. Considering the uttermost urgency of the matter, the Provisional Government of Latvia regards it their duty to entreat Your Excellency to supply Latvia with money, arms, food, clothing, and ammunitions. If Latvia could hope her request, which has been specified and tendered to your Government by her representatives five weeks ago, being complied with, we entreat Your Excellency to the help being sent without delay. Without immediate help everything would be lost, therefore we beg to insist on the situation being extremely critical.&quot;Esthonia. On August 14th Mr. Bosanquet reported the passage of the first reading of the Land Bill.   The process of taking it in sections was likely to delay -the second reading.The Deputy Commissioner (Reval), on August 14th, suggested that recognition of Esthonia should be subject to an undertaking about the behaviour of the Constituent Assembly and Government of Esthonia. Reasons were added. The same authority, on August 15th. forwarded the text of the declaration made by the North-West Russian Government to the Esthonian Government, and to the repre-sentatives at Reval of the British, French and United States Governments. The following are extracts specially affecting Esthonia : &quot;That independently of this (viz., assistance by Allied Powers) it is unavoidable to commence negotiations with Esthonian Government as to obtaining for the new province an outlet, to sea in ports of Esthonia in order to receive mutual commercial relations.&quot;&quot; That we rely on the Esthonian Government to give immediate aid to the Government of North-West Russia with armed force for deliverance of Petrograd and of the Petrograd, Pskoff and Novgorod Governments from Bolshevik tyranny, so that the Government may establish in Petrograd firm democratic order and initiate a democratic, policy founded on respect for rights and liberties of man.&quot;On August 14th the establishment at Reval of the Headquarters of the Russian North-Western Government was reported by the Deputy Commissioner.On August 15th the Deputy Commissioner reported that on August 1.3th he had presented, with the concurrence of the French and American representatives, a declaration by General Gough to the Esthonian Foreign Minister. The following is an extract: &quot; Lieutenant-General Sir Hubert Gough . . . . welcomes your assurance that the Esthonian Government is prepared to extend every support possible to the newly formed Russian North-West Government, and expects that you will give instructions to your Commander-in-Ghief to proceed at once to discuss details of co-operation with General Yudenich       .   .   .&quot;According to latest information (August 18th) the Esthonian Government, in reply, were pressing for recognition of the complete independence of their country by the Allies as a condition for co-operating with the Russians. The Deputy Commis--sioner at Reval, in forwarding this information, made suggestions about the conditions under which such recognition might be given.   [See also Astoria, August 19th.]      pj;.
German influence in the Baltic States. The following appeared in German Wireless on August 17th : General von der Goltz has been recalled by the German Government.With a view to disposing of special questions, a German-Lettish Commission has met in Riga. Negotiations will take place concerning the handing over of railway material, war material. &amp;c., which is to remain in Latvia.BRAZIL.Affairs at Bahia. The personal intervention of the President is assured in order to make a satisfactory arrangement in reply to complaints about the attitude of the municipality at Bahia (Sir A. Peel, August 16th).CHINA.Revolutionary Movements. Bolshevism is reported to be making no headway (Home Office, No.&quot; 10, August 14th).Chinese Eastern Railway. Sir J. Jordan (August 11th) is of opinion that strikes are to a great measure attributable to labour troitbles, not requiring the use of troops or the proclamation of martial law. He does not favour the use of British troops in the section of the railway for which the Chinese are responsible unless the United States will co-operate and assume permanent responsibility for defence of a portion of the railway themselves. The President was reported by the same authority (on August 12th) to have issued a mandate on August 11th appointing the Kirin Military Governor to command the Chinese troops protecting the line, and to be director of the railway in place of the Civil Governor of Kirin. It was feared that propaganda, by Bolshevik agents having been quoted as the catise of the strikes might bring, about military intervention under the terms of the military convention between China and Japan.Situation at Harbin. On August .14th the Consul at Harbin expressed the view that the strike in that part had been engineered deliberately by Bolsheviks. Political demands had been combined with demands for increased wages. Strikers had flown the red flag on a motor. The strike in its present stage would require force for its suppression. There were Japanese troops in Harbin. After three-and-a-half weeks the strikers had not returned to work, although offered the full increase of wages demanded. In forwarding this report Sir J. Jordan adhered to his opinion against the employment of British troops against Chinese workmen. Later on the same day he reported the substance of a message from the High Commissioner at Omsk, reporting that United States troops were ready to go to Harbin in certain circum-stances, and Sir J. Jordan under such conditions was ready to agree to British troops being sent there, while awaiting embarkation from Vladivostock. He maintained that such troops should only be used if asked for by the British Consul, to work, in co-operation with Chinese troops, for protection of the property and lives of foreigners. On August 16th (received 18th) Sir J. Jordan forwarded a further report from the British Consul at Harbin, explaining his attitude about using British troops at Harbin. On August 18th Mr. OReilly reported from Vladivostock that news had reached hint that the strike at Harbin had been settled. The Chinese had taken successful steps to guard the line, and the help of United States troops was not wanted.Tibet Frontiers. Sir J. Jordan on August 14th reported the opening of negotiations about the Tibetan frontier on August 13th, and the lines upon which they were proceeding.COSTA RICA.president and Vicc-P resident. According to a report from Mr. Bennett (Panama) of August 15th, President Tinoco has been granted leave of absence by Congress, and Quiros has been elected Vice-President. The- first Vice-President (Joaquiu, brother of the President) was shot dead in tire street by an unknown assassin on August 10th.
DENMARK.Slesvig Question. Tlie question of a German evacuation of the &quot;third zone&quot; cannot he reopened by the Peace Conference (Astoria, August loth).FINLAND.Revolutionary Movements. Home Office reports state that the election of Professor Stahlberg in place of General Mannerheim has stabilised the country. The campaign against Russia was unpopular (Home Office No. 10, August 14th).Repatriation of Finnish Legion. Mr. Bell (Helsingfors) reported on August 12th, on the authority of the Foreign Minister, that the Finnish Legion will most likely be disembarked at an island in the neighbourhood of Wasa. On August 20th Mr. Bell was informed of the influence of the shortage of shipping upon the necessity for disembarking &quot;Red &quot; Finns.General Mannerheim. Mr. Ramsay reported from Stockholm on August 13th, on Press authority, that General Mannerheim had been invited by President Stahlberg to become Minister in Paris. On August 19th Mr. Bell explained the Governments attitude towards Mannerheim.Supply of Arms by Allies. A Foreign Office telegram of August 19th explains steps taken by Great Britain to refuse licenses for supply of small-arms to Helsingfors.FRANCE.Attitude of French Press.-On August 14th Sir G. Grahame called attention to an article in the Intransigeant of the 13th, headed &quot; Our Allies show Conciliation&quot; about Syria. On August 15th to an article by &quot;Pertinax &quot; in the Echo, expressing a hope that the British Prime Minister will lose no time in dispelling doubts about the British attitude on the Syrian question. The Petit Journal and Petit Parisien refer to the subject of Syria on the same date. The Journal des Debats publishes a long-article on the British agreement with Persia. On August 17th (received 19th) to a long article (see Eastern Report) in the Temps on the same subject. On August lSth (received 20th) to another article in the Temps alleging that arms and ammunition had been supplied to the Emir Feisal from British ships via Beirut. On August 20th to further complaints in the Echo of action by the British military authorities in Syria.GERMANY.Revolutionary Movements. -The Home Office reported on August 14th that there was good reason for believing that the Spartacists had planned a rising for the first fortnight in August, but this was prevented by the wise precautions of the Govern-ment, which had managed with consummate skill to check the activities of the reactionaries on the one hand and the Spartacists on the other.Strikes. The following information about strikes is taken from German Wireless : The miners, smelters, electricians and railway employees of Upper Silesia have made the following demands : (1) immediate reinstatement of all dismissed employees ; (2) immediate resumption of activity in works that have been closed down ; (3) those who volunteered to defend the frontiers, under no circumstances to be re-employed ; (4) raising- of the state of siege; (5) immediate opening of the frontier,in order to overcome the dearth of food ; (6) release of all political prisoners; (7) a general increase of wages (August 14th).The latest reports from Upper Silesia point to a further development of the strike. Almost the whole of the Upper Silesian coal district is affected, and 85 per cent, to 90 por cent, of the miners are not working (August 15th).In consequence of the strike in the electricity works, all industrial concerns in Upper Silesia are at a standstill. According to a report from Beuthen, the trams are not running and newspapers are unable to appear. The following decision has been reached by the Conference at Kattowitz of representatives of employers and workmen : &quot; First, the strike is not being conducted by any Trades&apos; Union, and is,8709-31* B
consequently, an independent strike. It is, therefore, not justified, and must at once cease. Secondly, after the conclusion of the strike a Conference will he convened, at which negotiations will take place for the resumption of work in the concerns affected, 0 the relaxation of the stage of siege and the release from imprisonment of political offenders.&quot; Representatives of the organisations and the State Commissary declare that the demands should be granted, so far as they prove to be justified, after close examination, and that these should be put forward by competent quarters (August 17th).The strike situation in Upper Silesia appears to be gradually improving. The strikers have been ordered to resume work on Monday, and the severest measures are threatened against all who continue the strike. In various places it has been decided to resume work. The electricity stations, which have been in the hands of the military, are soon to be taken over again by the workers. Only a small military detachment will then remain temporarily for protective purposes (August 18th).- Ceded Territories in tlie East. Polish Wireless reported on August 12th :-*-There is a real danger of Germany removing from the ceded territories property which in virtue of Article 256 of the Peace Treaty should return to Poland, the value of such property being placed to the account of the Reparation Commission. The Polish Government request the Peace Conference to take immediate steps for preventing the removal of this property by Germany as such action causes loss to the reparation funds. Strzixski.Trade with Russia. On August 12th Mr. Ramsay reported from Stockholm, on the authority of a Press telegram from Berlin, that the condition of Germany did not permit of a large trade with Russia at the present time, but it was understood that trade on a small scale had already been resumed. A representative (Professor Hollmann, formerly at Kiao-chou) would soon go to Moscow, and a Bolshevik representative would come to Germany, on the understanding that no agitation in favour of Bolshevism would be carried on in that country. An official dementi was published by Wolff Bureau on August 11th to deny these reports of official representation (Mr. Ramsay, August 16th).Repatriation of Prisoners of War. The Secretary of State for War forwarded a memorandum on August 13th (G.T. 7986) asking that the consent of the Supreme Council might be obtained to repatriate all German prisoners in our charge, wherever they may be, as soon as possible after the ratification of the Peace Treaty.Suppression of the &quot; D.A. Zeitung.&quot; The following was published in German Wireless on August 15th : &quot; The Minister of Defence, Noske, has prohibited the publication of the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, on the ground that the newspaper stirred up agitation on the subject, of the return of German prisoners of war.&quot;British Occupation of Cologne Bridgehead. The political importance of the question of the nationality.of the troops occupying the bridgehead is emphasised in reports dated August 14th (Astoria).The Palatinate. German Wireless of August ISth states : &quot; Information of an official character from Munich states that the political situation in the Palatinate is fast heading to a climax. Part of the Press of the Centre Party treats the programme of the Bavarian Government with contempt and scorn and urges the view that the Palatinate&apos;s only salvation lies in its adhesion to the Rhine Republic now on the point of formation. The &apos; League of Free People &apos; of Dr.-Haas and comrades endeavours, by means of an increased agitation against the Palatinate Bavarian Government, to make the composition of the Rhenish Republic harmless, and urges a violent rupture with Bavaria and Germany. The French Occupation Authorities grant complete freedom of speech and writing to both sides, but ruthlessly suppress any expression of loyalty to Germany. The &apos; League of Free People,&apos;in collusion with the Inde-pendent Social Democrats, contemplates a violent coup in the near future. As the League has complete freedom of action and arms, which must be of French origin, the clanger to the Palatinate is greater than ever. May this cry of need find an echo in the Neutral Press.&quot;Anti-British Propaganda.  Vorwacrts denounces the Anglo-Persian Treaty as a &quot; Lion&apos;s Treaty&quot; in the fullest sense of the word, and accuses England of violating
in a glaring manner the clause of the Peace Treaty which upholds the independence of small nations. According to Voricaerts, England has deprived Persia of self-administration and ejected her from the ranks of Independent States in open defiance of the Peace Treaty (German Wireless, August ISth).Third Zone in Slesvig. See under &quot; Denmark.&quot;HUNGARY.Revolutionary Movements. A Home Office Report (No. 10, August 14th) expresses the opinion that &quot; the fall of Bela Knn, precipitated by the reverses of the Red-Army, -was really due to the universal hatred in which his Government was held, and to the decline of production in the Communal workshops.&quot;Accusations of Rumanian Brutality. A report from Mr. Rattigan (Bucharest, August 10th, received ISth) states :  &quot; Mr. Bratiano explained to me that the only occurrences which could have given rise to the accusation of Rumanian brutality were as follows : Many of Bolshevik troops wore no uniform or badge of any kind, and were indistinguishable from civilian population. In some instances such troops had murdered Rumanian sentries, &amp;c, and had been denounced hy Hungarian villagers. When evidence such as hidden rifles had been discovered, and proofs were conclusive, guilty persons had been naturally executed out of hand. But every care had been taken to establish the facts to avoid punishment of innocent people. Both the King and the Prime Minister further assured me that Rumanian troops had abstained from all looting and pillaging during the advance. They alfirmed that Rumanian troops had been welcomed almost everywhere by the population as protectors against the cruelties and tyranny of Bela Kun&apos;s Bolsheviks.&quot; The Prime Minister informed me that, far from starving Budapest, the Rumanian authorities had done everything possible to assist the local authorities in revictualling the city, which the Rumanian Army had found practically destitute of food. As regards interruption of railway communications, he stated categorically that only on few railway lines have communications been interrupted, for reasons of mere military security.&quot; The Government which has succeeded Bela Kun has neither been arrested nor replaced by Rumanian trooj)S. The Rumanian Government .are resolved, the Prime Minister assured me, to place themselves in entire agreement with the Allies in regard to the attitude to be adopted towards the formation of any particular GoA^ernment which it may be decided to set up in Hungary. They luvve no special knowledge of the Archduke JoseplYs coup d&apos;etat, and haAre certainly done nothing to assist it.&quot;A Proclamation signed by the Rumanian General and by the High Commissioner of the Rumanian Government was issued by Budapest Wireless on August 13th. It contained the words : &quot;NeAvs of a tendencious and malevolent character is being circulated, insinuating that the Army Command of the Rumanian Government haA-e contributed in some way or other to the accession to poAver of the present Government. From the commence-ment the Army Command in Transylvania has made it clear that the Rumanian military authorities do not and will not interfere in the internal questions of Hungary. The Rumanian Army up to the present has not recognised any Hungarian Government.&quot;The following report from General Greenly was forwarded by Mr. Rattigan on August 13th (received 20th) in confirmation of the above : &quot; The Rumanian troops are behaving A^ery Avell and the Commanders are doing their best&apos; to carry out orders of the Rumanian Government regarding conciliatory treatment of the Hungarian population.   The town of Budapest is quite tranquil.&quot;Reports from Serbia. On August 10th (received 13th) Sir C. des Graz reported from Belgrade : *&apos; A rumour circulating here yesterday that the Socialist Administration at Buda Pesth has been replaced by a Government with the Archduke Joseph at its head caused a flutter.   The idea is distasteful here, if meaning a possibility of the reunion of
Hungary with Austria under a Hapshurg,1 and the creation anew of a stronger State on the borders of Jugo-Slavia. I heard last night that it was thought that the Szegedin Government wordd join the new Government at Pesth, and it is said that forces under orders of former about three battalions are alreadv on their wav to Pesth.&quot;This was followed on August loth (received 20th) by a telegram from Sir C. des Graz, from which the following is an extract: &quot; Very general anxiety is being expressed here, both in conversation and in the Press, at the reported formation of a New Government in Hungary under the Archduke Joseph. It is termed somewhat precipitately the resurrection of the Hapsburgs.   It was considered that the dynasty had foundered in the war.&quot;Navigation of the Danube. On August 16th, Admiral Troubridge reported by wireless from Budapest : &apos;&apos;The mines in the Danube lnvve been removed. The Commission informs, you that navigation of the Danube can recommence from Sulina as far as Ratisbon.&quot;A Press Wireless message from Btidapest of the same date added that oAviug to coal scarcity the navigation would be extremely limited.Hungarian Government. On August loth, German Wireless reported the fall of Lovaczy&apos;s Cabinet, and added, on August 17th :  &quot; The Hungarian Prime Minister, Friedrich, has made the following communi-cation to the Press representatives : &quot; &apos; After negotiations lasting three days the Government has been finally con-stituted. It has been impossible, of course, to satisfy the wishes and claims of all. Three portfolios are at the disposal of organised labour.&apos;&quot; The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lovaczy, stated that the Government regarded itself as a prcmsional one. and Avould at once resign after the meeting of the National Assembly. Up till then its most important task Avould be to restore order and to safeguard property, in order that the elections for the National Assembly may take place under quiet conditions. The Government will oppose the extreme elements and all attempts at Bolshevism, as well as the reactionary elements and religious intolerance. As regards foreign policy, the GoA^ernment&apos;s main effort Avill be directed tOAvards obtaining a satisfactory peace for the country as soon as possible.&quot;Budapest Wireless of August 17th reported : &quot; The Archduke Joseph, in a message to Clemenceau, states that the Hungarian GoArermnent has been finally constituted, with the object of restoring internal order, holding the elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and concluding peace.   The members of the. Cabinet are as follows : &quot; President of the Council and Interim Minister ofCommerce - - - -   Friedrich.Minister for Home Affairs  - Baron Perenyi.Minister for Justice    - Baloglry,Minister for Agriculture     - Szabo.Minister for Education and Public Worship -   Huszar.Minister for Public Health        - &apos; - -   Czillery (? Caillery).Minister for National Minorities - -   Bleyer.Minister for War       - General Sclmetzer.Minister for Propaganda    - Ha Her.Minister for the Preparation of Peace Negotiations   -   Count Teleki.&quot; This Government Avill resign when the National Assembly has been convoked, and the Archduke will at the same time lay down his functions as Governor. The National Assembly will ratify the peace, and fix the form of the State and the Constitution.&quot;1 See also the Prague report, under Austria, aud the following extract from German Wireless of August ISth : &quot;According&apos; to a Vienna report, the ex-Emperor Karl insists on the carrying through of a measure (Aktion) according&apos; to which the mandate of the Archduke Joseph for Hungary must be based not only on the will of the Entente Powers, but chiefly on a constitutional mission for Hungary, delivered to the Archduke by the ox-Emperor Karl. The ex-Emperor Karl is supported in the carrying through of this anensuro by the former Hungarian Prime Ministers Andrassy and Wekcrle.&quot;
In commenting on this message, the Editor of Wireless Neics added : The constitution of the Hungarian Cabinet as given hy the Archduke Joseph, differs slightly from that given in a Budapest message of August 15th. The Archduke&apos;s message, is, however, jammed in places.&quot;Search for former Hungarian Commissaries. The Criminal Department of the Budapest police has requested all tbe administrative and police authorities, as well as the police in Vienna, to instigate a search for 21 former Feople&apos;s Commis-saries, including Bela Kun, Wilhelm Boehm, and the former President of the Budapest Soldiers&apos; and AVorkers&apos; Council, who are suspected of being the authors or instigators of various crimes. In the event of their discovery, they are to he placed under arrest pending examination (German Wireless, August 18th).ITALY.Revolutionary Movements. A Home Office Report (No. 10, August 14th) states : &quot; In Italy, lately the least stable of European States, there is some reaction against Bolshevik activities.&quot;Sample of Anti-British Propaganda. On August 13th, Sir R. Rodd called attention to a report in the Avanti (Socialist), said to have come from Vienna on August. 6th : &quot; British sailors stationed at Baku to hold the maritime base against the Soviet have mutinied, hoisting red flag on ships and demanding immediate repatriation. In view of the Bolshevik spirit which inspired the mutineers, the men-of-war left Baku for an unknown destination.&quot;JAPAN.Japanese Policy in China (&quot;Shantung &quot; Question). On August 13th Mr. Alston was informed of the substance of a conversation with the Japanese Ambassador in London on August Oth on the subject of the declaration by the Japanese Foreign Minister, published in The Times of August 6th (see Appendix to Western Report No. 131). A report of anti-Christian propaganda by the Japanese in Shantung has been received from American authority (Mr. Lindsay, August 15th).Japanese in Corea. On the same date Mr. Alston was informed of the substance of a further conversation on atrocities in Corea (see Western Report No. 130, page 7), in which reference was made to the need for an official enquiry. On August 13th (received 16th) Mr. Alston reported the appointments of Admiral Baron Saito as Governor-General, and of Mr. Midzumo as Chief Administrator of Corea.Japanese Policy in Siberia. A message from the Military Attache forwarded by Sir J. Jordan on August 11th (received 13th) quoted a statement by the War Minister on August 5th, pointing to the probability, should the Allied forces be withdrawn, of Japan framing an independent policy in Siberia.Labour Unrest, ccc.

The Prince&apos;s instructions were that the Ministry should be constituted with the least possible delay, and work in harmony with the Assembly. Monsieur Davidovitch, after having failed to make up a Cabinet without the old Radicals, has again approached Monsieur Protitch.

August 18th).Social Democratic Party.

APPENDIX. 11 to western and G-eneral Report No. 133.LEAGUE OP NATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary-General [G.T. 8012] on Progress made.Owing to the political situation in America, it has not been found possible to have more than two meetings of the Organisation Committee of the League of Natious -which was established by a plenary session of the Peace Conference. All questions, therefore, have necessarily been left over till the first meetings of the Council. As soon as the Treaty of Peace comes into force, the President of the United States will, it is assumed, convoke a meeting of the Council probably in either London or Paris. When this summons is received, the Acting Secretary-General proposes to invite the G-governments of the States represented on the Council to attend the meeting at as early a date as possible. This will probably be a week after the issue of the Presidents summons. The Governments of the nine States to whom this invitation will be addressed wdll have to decide whether they will send representatives to the meeting, and, if so, whether these representatives will have full power to act on the Council, or whether they will attend in a purely advisory capacity. It is understood that, from the legal point of view, the Council will be validly constituted whether the full number of representatives attend or not.There are certain duties that it is incumbent on the Council under the Treaty of Peace with Germany to perform immediately :  (1) The constitution of the Delimitation Committee for the Sarre Basin territory. (2) The constitution of tho Governing Commission of the Sarre Basin territory. (3) The appointment of a High Commissioner for Danzig.A decision will be required as to whether the Council should confine itself to these duties and to certain urgent questions connected with the organisation of the International Secretariat, postponing the discussion of other matters until all the Powers represented on the Council have ratified the Treaty, or whether it should proceed with the discussion of other problems without delay.   Such problems are: (i) The constitution and appointment of a permanent Naval, military and Air commission which has to advise the Council on the reduction of national armaments, the manufacture by private enterprise of munitions and implements of war, and lastly on the regulations to be prescibed by the League in regard to naval and military forces and armaments of any Power seeking admission thereto. (Finland, Georgia, Iceland and San Marino will probably apply for admission at the first meeting of the Assembly.)(ii) The appointment of a Committee of international jurists to advise on thepreparation of plans for the constitution of the Permanent Court of International Justice.(iii) The date of and agenda for the first meeting of the Assembly.(iv) Various other minor questions.There is one other subject which will require an early decision, namely, the question of the admission of the Press to the meetings of the Council. It seems necessary that this point should be determined at the first meeting of the Council.As regards the date of and agenda for the Assembly, it should be noted that the President of the United States has called a meeting of the Labour Conference for the 29th October. The question for decision is whether the Assembly should follow-after the Labour Conference as soon after the ratification of the Treaty of Peace by the Senate as is possible, allowing for the necessary material arrangements, or whether it should be postponed until the work of organisation has reached a more complete stage.
\If the first alternative is adopted, certain other matters require examination such as : (a) the probable duration of the meeting of the Assembly ;(I)) the period which should elapse between the first and second meetings of the Assembly ;(c) where the second meeting of the Assembly should take place ;(d) whether the Council should sit at Washington during the meetings of theAssembly;The question of admission of enemy countries to the League is likely to he raised at the first meeting of the Assembly and should be considered in cannection with it.E. D.August 14th, 1919.
