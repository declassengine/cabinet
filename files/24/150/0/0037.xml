WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Breaches of (lie &quot; Laws of War.&quot; Id connection with the Articles of the Peace Treaties referring to the arraignment of the ex-Kaiser, and the trial of perpetrators of atrocities during the war, a Committee, appointed by the Attorney-General with the authority of the War Cabinet on November 1st, 1918, presented a First Interim Report on January .13th, 1919, and a Second Interim. Report on June 3rd, 1919. These have been printed as a secret document (G.T. 7806) which, in addition to the reports, contains the following important papers: &quot;Immunity of Sovereigns,&quot; by Sir John Macdonell ; &quot;Superior Orders,&quot; by Professor J. Pi. Morgan; &quot;A Note on the.

German Orders for Ruthless Submarine Warfare, and a Memorandum including valuable historic-documents on the detention of Napoleon Buonaparte, it is only possible in the space available to call attention to the great value for reference purposes of the various documents and opinions to be found in this secret blue book.AUSTRIA.Frontier with Serbo-Croat-Slovene State. A protocol for settling the frontier line was signed on July 28th by representatives of German-Austria and the Serbo-Croat-Slovene State. Evacuation of the northern area of the occupied territory was to be carried out on July 31st (German Wireless, July 27th).THE BALTIC STATES.German Attitude. At the request of Sir Hubert Gough&apos;, Mr. Grant Watson (Riga) on August 3rd called attention to the attitude of General von der Goltz, who refused to put forward any plan for the Germans to evacuate Courland. A report from Mr. Bosanquet, at Reval, dated July 31st, expresses certainty that agents of Germany are doing all they can to exploit the situation in the Baltic States as affecting, more especially, influence upon the &quot; Russian Northern Army.&quot; A later report from Mr. Bosanquet (August 5th) gives definite information about the pro-Germanism of General Arsaniev, who has assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Pskoff district. Besides his owmtroops from -Latvia, numbers of Germans and Baits are reported to be joining him. Lievenis and von der Goltz&apos;s German troops are expected to do so. It is further reported that Yamburg was surrendered deliberately, and the blowing up of bridges was in direct contravention of orders issued by General Yttdenich.- Latvia and Courland. Recent experience proves that it will not be possible while Mi tan is occupied by the Germans either to reconstruct or to pacify the country (Mr. Watson, August 3rd). The fact that German influence over the Baits has been removed ought to facilitate the working together of the Letts and the Baits in the interests of Latvia. General von der Goltz is, however, credited with intrigues to turn one against the other and to encourage Bolshevism. It is considered probable that his policy will produce chaos, and that the Germans would thus endeavour to furnish pretexts for remaining in Courland. German soldiers have been constantly demanding land in that Province (General Gough/s views as reported by Mr. Watson, August 3rd).On July 30th, Mr. Watson reported delay in the return of confidence owing to the fact that the Germans were remaining at Mitau.
An election Bill had been drafted in order that it might be discussed in the Volksrat.   The Socialists were supporting a proposal for the suffrage age limit to be fixed at 21 years.   The bourgeois parties wished it to be at least 24 years.   Tfie Socialists were showing feeling against the Entente Powers,   The Volksrat proposed &apos; to assemble again on the 11th of August.On July 31st it was reported that severe military censorship was being applied to speakers and journalists of Radical proclivities (Mr. Watson).Eslhonia.-The following note, addressed to the Esthonian Premier, was drafted at a meeting at Reval on July 28th, attended by the British representatives, by the General of the American Peace Mission, and hy General Gough :  &quot;The representatives of the Allied and Associated Governments view with apprehension and concern the Esthonians&apos; agrarian project as submitted by the Constituent Assembly&apos;s Committee, and particularly those elements which, firstly, offer no security or protection to foreign property or realty owners; secondly, provide for confiscation of private-owned property or realty; thirdly, appropriation of any property without full and just, compensation in conformity with the principles and practices of Allied democratic Governments, whose aid and support the Esthonians are. seeking. The representatives of the Allied and Associated Governments suggest, before action on any such momentous problem as its (? agrarian) (&apos;? interests) is (? determined), that the Esthonian Provisional Government obtain from the Allied and Associated Governments (? a declaration of their) attitude thereon.&quot;The note was subsequently presented at the British Consulate-General, with the explanation that the Allies did not&apos; wish to interfere with Esthonians&apos; affairs, but desired to allow them full liberty of self-government; but, as Esthonia was at present entirely dependent on the Allies for supplies, they felt a certain, responsibility that justice and moderation should be shown, in her legislation (Mr. Bosanquet, duly 28th).According to reports from Mr. Bosanquet (July 31st and August 1st), there are strong indications of German influence being brought to bear from Esthonia in order to induce the Russian Northern Army to turn to Germany1 on the plea that England had failed to supply military and other stores said to be urgently required. [In connection with this report, it is to be noted that Lord kilmarnock sent from Copenhagen on July 31st information about the shortage of supplies in the Russian Army referred to, and a suggestion that the need could be met from available British supplies at Copenhagen.]Recognition of Esthonia. Mr. Bosanquet on August 4th forwarded a report that Esthonian military and other authorities were agreed that unless Esthonia was recognised it would be difficult to induce the troops to do more than stand on the defensive, and that, purely defensive warfare was difficult to maintain for any length of time.Prospects of Advance on Petrograd.- On August oth or Gth the Esthonian Foreign Minister proposed to visit Belsingfors to sound Finnish opinions about advancing on Petrograd.CHINA.Manchuria. Sir J. Jordan on August 3rd reported acts of brigandage at Sansing, about 200 miles down the River Sungari from Harbin, and elsewhere following, upon the withdrawal of Chinese forces. According to a previous report from the same source (July 31st) 48,000 men under Kaoshipin had assembled near Changchun to oppose General Chang (Mukden) who commanded far superior forces. The Central Government is apparently unable to exercise any control over the situation in Manchuria.Japanese Control over Chinese Eastern Railway. Both Sir J. Jordan and Mr. Alston (August 1st) confirm last week&apos;s reports of the view that the Japanese policy is to obtain military control over the Chinese Eastern Railway.   Sir J. Jordan expects that the plea will be put forward that the Chinese troops are inefficient, but points -out that the tise of Japanese troops in their place would lead to more seriousSee also under &quot; German attitude &quot; above.
disturbances. The Chinese, on the other hand, would most likely he able to deal with any probable situations.&apos; Tibetan Frontier. The question of the situation on the frontier on the expiration of the present truce is the subject of correspondence between Sir J. Jordan, the Foreign Oflice, India Office, and Indian Government (Sir J. Jordan, July 30th, and Foreign Office, August 1st).DENMARK.Slesvig Question. The following telegram was received from Ford Kilmarnock on August J st: &quot; The debate on interpellation took place yesterday (July 30th). A motion by the Opposition demanding that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should support in the most effective manner possible the wish expressed by North Slesvig electors&apos; union for evacuation of third zone was negatived by 70 votes to 66. A vote of confidence in the Government was passed by 70 to 67.&quot;A proposal that tin; resolution of union of the electors of North Siesvig, calling for the evacuation of the third zone, should be presented officially to the Riksdag was rejected by the union by a small majority on July 28th, and the Chairman of the Union then resigned. [see also under Germany.] (Lord Kilmarnock, July 31st.)if. Claud el, the new French Minister at Copenhagen, will be the French representative on the Slesvig Commission (Sir C. Marling, August 1st).FRANCE.Cessation of Hostilities. On August 1st Sir G. Grahame reported that the Government had laid&apos;a Bill before the Chamber regulating the official date for the cessation of hostilities. The date is to be reckoned &quot; as from the day on which the treaty of peace with Germany, after its ratification by Parliament, is published in the Journal Ofjicicl, without waiting for the conclusion of peace with the other countries at war with France.&quot;&quot; Ratification of Peace Treaty loith Germany. Sir G. Grahame reported as follows on August 2nd: &quot;The Peace Commission of the Chamber of Deputies decided yesterday by 34 votes to 1 and two abstentions in favour of ratification of Peace Treaty. A7ote against ratification u as given by Monsieur Louis Marin on ground of inadequacy of reparations, relative insecurity of Rhine frontier, non-disarmament of Germany and lack of precision in indemnity clauses. Messieurs Grodet and Daniel Vincent abstained from voting.On July 29th (received 31 st) Sir G. Grahame thought that French public opinion seemed to be somewhat uneasy at the opposition which was being shown by the American Senate to the Treaty of Versailles, and more than ever inclined to appreciate the prompt action of the British Parliament in the matter.Egyptian Delegation. On August 2nd the Egyptian Delegation in Paris gave a luncheon at Clariclge&apos;s Hotel, ostensibly to representatives of Allied Press, which was attended by some 150 persons, to &quot; explain what the delegation had intended to say to the Allied Plenipotentiaries if the latter had consented to receive them.&quot; Expressions of sympathy were made by M. Augagueur, French Left Deputy and ex-Minister, by Mr. Gibbons, on behalf of the American Press, and hy M. Emmanuel for that of Italy. A protest by M. Anatole, France, describing Egypt as the &quot; great victim of the peace &quot; was read out (Sir G. Grahame, August 3rcD.French Policy in the Near East. Sir G. Grahame called attention on July 30th to a strong article by M. Saint Brice in the Journal of that day accusing Great Britain of exploiting the military situation in Syria for her own ends : &quot; The British, have troops in Syria and hold the railways and the forts. They control the re-victualling of the country. They hold out the hope of preventing the dismember-ment of Syria by uniting it as a whole under British protection. They lay stress on the weakness of exhausted France and her religious dissensions.&quot;
Trade Halations with Germany. In a memorandum by the Commercial Counsellor to the British Embassy, forwarded by Sir (.1. Grahame, the opinion-is expressed that the idea that the French will refuse, oiv sentimental grounds, to trade with Germany when it is to their advantage to do so would prove to be false. French importations into the German territories on the left bank of the Rhine had reached a value of 500,000,000 francs by the middle of last June.GERMANY.Relationship with, Russian Bolsheviks. Lord Kilmarnock has gathered from a source usually well-informed that commercial travellers in Germany are freely alleging that they can travel about Soviet Russia and do business there. Also that herr Midler, the Foreign Minister, has heard from Chicherin. the Bolshevik Foreign Affairs Commissary, that visits of German capitalists would not be hindered (July 31 si). Further rumours about the diplomatic and economic relationship between Germany and Soviet Russia came from Stockholm (Mr. Ramsay) on July 30th.German Wireless of August 2nd denied the current reports that German officers and non-commissioned officers had been despatched to improve the Russian &quot; Soviet Army,&quot; adding the following: &quot;Assertions are also made concerning a secret Treaty between Germany and the Soviet Government, details of which will shortly be published. These assertions are designated by authoritative German sources, as pure fictions, and non-Bolshevist circles in Russia are warned against any fables which suggest the idea of Germany&apos;s desire to strengthen the military power of Bolshevism.&quot;Policy in Baltic Provinces. Under the heading of &quot; Baltic States,&quot; extracts are given from reports indicating the policy of German officers remaining in those States.Food Conditions. Meat, butter and milk remain strictly rationed. The rations of bread and Hour are to be raised from October 1st (German Wireless, August 2nd).The German &quot; Reich.&quot; The Tageblatt has recently replied to French comments that the word &quot; Reich &quot; denotes an Empire ruled by an Emperor by referring to speeches by Mirabeau in 1789, describing France as an Empire at that date (German Wireless, J uly 20th).Erzberger&apos;s Disclosures. German Wireless of July 20th published the following statement by von Kuhimann, former German Secretary of State: &quot; It is now, in my opinion, the duty of the Cabinet to decide how much it is possible to publish concerning important diplomatic proceedings. Personally I do not consider myself authorised to publish, without the sanction of the Foreign Office, proceedings that took place during my tenure of office, and feel bound indeed to question the value of so doing with regard.to our policy as a whole. A true explanation of what happened will probably only be possible by means of such a procedure as that planned to take place in the State Law Courts at which political events can be tested in their context in connection with the whole collected documentary material.&quot;.Anti-Entente Wireless Propaganda. German Wireless of J uly 31st returns to the familiar war methods, especially as affecting the British in the Baltic States, and the French, in the Palatinate.Kiel Dockyard. It is alleged that only 1,700 out of 13,000 workmen hitherto -employed are to be taken on again when work is resumed on about August 14th (German Wireless, July 31st).Strikes.- The Berlin telegraphists&apos; strike has been settled (ibid).National Assembly (Vote of Censure). The vote of censure proposed by the National Party was rejected by 213 votes to 53, and a vote of confidence carried by a large majority (German Wireless, July 30th).Goal Supplies and Distribution. The following appeared in German Wireless for July 30th: &quot; Regarding the distribution of available coal supplies in Germany, the following is announced from responsible quarters : &apos; The first to be taken into8709 -.11 ii
consideration will be railways, then ships carrying- foodstuffs, thenfactoriesproducing foodstuffs, then fuel for domestic purposes, and lastly industry. The requirements of industry amount, according to the present situation, to 94 million tons of coal, of which only 10 million can at present be supplied. If, therefore, coal production is not immediately increased, so that industry may receive considerably more than 10 per cent, of its requirements, there will probably be millions of unemployed by the autumn. In order to make a larger production of coal possible, plans are being made to set up a compulsory arbitration tribunal in the mining districts to regulate all wage demands, and prevent strikes. In any case the supply of coal for domestic purposes will have to be considerably reduced.&apos; &quot;HONDURAS.Unsettled Slate. Conflicts between rebels and Government troops all over the country Avere reported on duly 30th. Two small towns in the South had been captured by the former (Mr. Armstrong, Guatemala).HUNGARY.Report from Bucharest. Last Aveek&apos;s report from Mi-. Rattigan about the alleged projected visit of a representative of a British Socialist newspaper to Budapest to establish communications Avith the Hungarian Bolsheviks has been cleared up, and proved to be -without foundation (Foreign Office to Mr. Rattigau, /Vugust 1st).Resignation of Bela Knns Bolshevik Government. At a meeting of the Budapest WorkmeiYs Council on August 1st, Bela Kun&apos;s Government resigned. Hungarian wireless of that date announced the names of the new Government in the following terms :--&quot;The new Government, Avhich is purely Socialist in character, consists of representatives of the Trades Unions with Julius Peidl as Prime Minister. Other members of the Government are: Karl Peyer. Minister of the Interior; Josef Haubrich, Minister of War ; Peter Agoston, Minister for Foreign Affairs ; Alexander Garbai, Minister of Education ; Ernst Garami, Minister of Justice : Josef Takacs, Minister of Agriculture; Josef Miakits, Finance Minister; Anton DoAvcsak, Minister of Trade and Industry; Franc Knatelhoffer, Food Minister ; and Victor Knaller,. Minister for the &quot;Nationalities.&quot;In a proclamation published on August 2nd the new Government declared that their first duty would be the maintenance of internal order and the initiation of negotiations Avith the Entente.[The following information is supplied by the Editor of Wireless news:  Agoston was elected the President of the Congress of the Workmen&apos;s, Soldiers&apos; and Peasants&apos; Councils at Budapest in June. He was subsequently sent to Vienna to settle differences between Hungary and German-Austria, while there he also concluded a convention with the Czecho-Slovak representative concerning the exchange of prisoners.Haubrich, until replaced by Szamuely, was Commander-in-Chief of the Hungarian Red Army.Garbai was President of the late Hungarian Soviet Republic]The Chief of the Italian Military Mission at Budapest (Lieut.-Col. Romanelli) issued by wireless on August 1st the following message, addressed to M. Clemenceau, on the subject of the resignation of the Government : &quot;The Hungarian Government of the Soviet Republic have to-day resigned and have been replaced by a neAv Government Avho have declared that they will accept the proposals of the Allied and Associated Powers which were agreed upon in Vienna on July 25th by Prince Bprghese, the Plenipotentiary of Italy, and Colonel Cunningham, Chief of the British Military Mission in Vienna.&quot;&apos; The neAv Government have just entrusted me, in my qualify of sole representative of the above-mentioned PoAvers at Budapest, with the duty of communicating to the Commanders of the opposing armies the proposal for an armistice which, Avhile aAvaiting the decisions of Your Excellency, I am permitted to transmit direct to the-
above-mentioned Commanders with the object of avoiding further bloodshed. The proposals are as follows : &quot;(I) While awaiting the decisions of the Supreme Council of the Allied and Associated Powers, to suspend with the shortest possible delay all hostilities between the Allied armies and the Hungarian army.&quot; (2) To stop all forward movements on the part of the Allied troops.&quot; (3) To conclude ah armistice with the Commander of the Hungarian army and not to extend the provisional lines of occupation until the President of the Peace Conference has made known his decisions on this subject.&quot; The Hungarian Government particularly ask that the armistice line for the Rumanian Army be fixed at the Tisza (Theiss).&quot;M. Clemenceau replied on August 2nd :  &quot;I have received your radio of August 1st announcing the resignation of the Hungarian Soviet Government and the declarations made by the new Government which have been brought to the knowledge of the Supreme Council. The Allied Council consider that it is not their business to intervene in the internal policy of the Hungarian Republic and for this reason will not consider the proposals made by the two members of the Allied Missions in Vienna. The following are the only recognised bases for relations between the Allied and Associated Powers on the one-hand and Hungary on the other : -&quot;(1) The Armistice of November 13th, 1918, the conditions of which should be respected by the new Hungarian Government,  especially as far as the demobilisation of the army is concerned. &quot; (2) The intimation of the Peace Conference of June 13th, which fixed the line which the Hungarian troops should respect on the Czecho-Slovak andRumanian Iron tiers.&apos;: The Allied Council will only ask tire Rumanian Government to stop their troops on the frontier which they occupy at present in consequence of aggression hy the Hungarian army. The Allied Council will not ask the Rumanians to (? withdraw) their troops as far as the line fixed on June 13th until. the new Government in Budapest have strictly obeyed the Armistice conditions. The Allied and Associated Powers are waiting to see whether the new Hungarian Government will carry out their pledges. The Allied and Associated Powers hope that the advent of a Government who will execute their engagements and represent the Hungarian people will hasten the re-establishment of peace and the resumption of economic relations.&quot;On August 3rd the following message, marked &quot; very urgent,&quot; was sent by Wireless by M. Pichon to the French Minister at Bucharest : &quot; I have communicated to you the radio sent by the President of the Peace Conference to the Head of the Italian Mission at Budapest. In accordance with the contents of this communication, which represents the decisions of the Supreme Council of the Allied and Associated Powers, please ask the Rumanian Government immediately to halt their troops on the positions which they occupy at present.&quot;Later reports (Paris Wireless, August 5th) state that the Supreme Council of the Peace Conference is sending to Budapest a mission consisting of four generals, American, French, English and Italian.A proclamation by the new Government states that &quot;well-tried leaders of trades unionism have taken over the Government. Every Workers&apos; Council remains where it is &quot; (Kolnische Zeituraj, August 2nd).On August 2nd a message dated July 21st was received from Sir C. des Graz (Belgrade) forwarding information about the Hungarian anti-Bolshevik or &quot; White&quot; ministry at Czegedin having been democratised by the retirement of Count J. Andrassy and others, and reporting that the new President of the Government Avas M. Desider Abraham. Vienna Wireless of August 5th reported that the rival Govern-ment at Czegedin was sending troops against the capital.Rumanian Advance. On July 29th it was reported from Bucharest that the Hungarian offensive against the Rumanians had been completely stopped and broken by the Rumanian army, which was pursuing the Hungarians. The subsequent advance of the Rumanians to the outskirts of Budapest has been since reported in the Press, and in the Hungarian wireless military report of August 4th.
Later Hungarian Wireless of August 4th reported as follows : &quot; In spite of Clemenceau&apos;s Note the Rumanians entered Budapest at 2 o&apos;clock this afternoon. The entry of the Rumanians had tho worst effect on the population and numerous disturbances, probably leading to bloodshed, are expected. The population demand that the British and American troops should enter the city as this is the only means by which bloodshed can be avoided. The Rumanians are taking hostages, declaring that they will kill five Hungarians for every Rumanian soldier killed.&quot;Against this, a Rumanian Wireless Military Report of August 5th states that the operations against Budapest had finished, and that the troops were making a halt before Budapest. Latest reports confirm the statement that the Rumanians have occupied the town.Negotiations between Beta Kirn and Czecho-Slovakia. Mr. Gosling (Prague) on July 30th (received August 1st) reported on further, negotiations between Bela Kun and the Czecho-Slovak Prime Minister (Tusar) about stopping hostilities on the frontier (see former Western Reports).ITALY.Finnic and the Adriatic Question (see under &quot;Peace Discussions&quot;).JAPAN.Policy in Shantung. Sir J. Jordan, on August 4th. gave an important appre-ciation of Japanese policy in the Shantung province, based on precedents in Corea and Manchuria. The dependence of the Chinese Government, with military sym-pathies and composition, upon the military party in Japan, is a strong feature of the situation. (See previous Reports.) The control not only of Tsing-Tau, but of 245 miles of railway, would give more than economic privileges. Ffn this connection, a recent official statement by the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs is considered of sufficient importance to reproduce. It appeared in The Times of August Gth, and is given in an Appendix to this Report.]MEXICO.Banditism.  On August 4th Mr. Cummins reported a serious situation and the suspension of traffic in the Frontero district. Business was paralysed. Boats were beiho; attacked and looted.Policy of United States of America.  The United States Press campaign against Mexico is being reported in the local Press (Mr. Cummins, July 29th). The Government expects to be called to account shortly by the United. States Government (July 31st).MONTENEGRO.Attitude of the &apos; Population. Information forwarded by Sir G. Grahame (August 5th) and Count de Salis (July 28th-31st) show considerable opposition amongst.the Montenegrins to the Serbians, Avho arc reported to be holding the principal towns and dominating the country population, by force. Information from Italian sources states that 80 percent, of the population are opposing the Serbian occupation.POLAND.Bolshevik Propaganda. Information has been received about propaganda by a Bolshevik agent in Poland fForeign Office, August 5th).Negotiations with German Government. M. Paderewski has agreed to proposals by the German Government (July 25th-29th) to send Polish plenipotentiaries to negotiate at Berlin about transferring the administration of the territories ceded by Germany under the Peace Terms (Polish Wireless, August 4th).
Resignation of Ministry. Sir C. des Graz reported on July 29th (received August 2nd) that the Ministry had decided to place their resignation in the hands of the Crown Prince on his return to the country, which was expected shortly.Agent from Austria. The visit to Belgrade oil an unofficial Austrian Agent was reported on July 26th (&quot;received 30th). lie saw the Foreign Minister (Sir 0. des Graz). &apos; &apos; .Situation at Tamesvar. In accordance with the advice of the Military Attache at Belgrade a British officer is to remain at Temesvar until the Rumanian occupation. (Foreign Office, duly 31st).SWEDEN.Aaland Islands. Mr. Ramsay, on August 2nd, quoted Press reports of the same date, to the effect that the Paris Supreme Council had acceded to the request of the Swedish Government to represent their case.SWITZERLAND.Strike at Basle. Lord Acton reported a strike on July 30th because the dye industry dispute had not been settled, but the object of the strike apparently went beyond this, and was connected with the general demand by work-people for cheaper living. Members of the Cantonal Government produced a good effect by going to Berne to urge the reduction in price of milk, clothing, and rent (August 2nd). On August 5th Lord Acton further reported that the Berne Workmen&apos;s Union and the Olten Union of Swiss workmen had pronounced against a strike. It seemed probable that the strike would collapse in a few days. Gas supply at Basle had been cut off. The strike movement at Zurich seemed to be weakening.Miscellaneous Reports. The ex-Emperor Charles of Austria on July7 2(5th publicly7 contradicted rumours that he was going to England or to German-Austria (Lord Acton, July 26th, received August 2nd). Lord Acton on J uly 31st reported recent activities of the ex-King of Greece, who expected his early restoration. He was heavily in debt in Switzerland. A visit by Prince Max of Baden to Switzerland still seems to be on the tapis.   His family has returned to Germany (July 28th).VATICAN.Erzberger&apos;s Disclosures. The Vatican wish to publish some documents, subject to the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government (Mr. Gaisford, July 31st). The following announcement appeared in German Wireless of July 30th : &quot;Archbishop Pacedi has had the following statement published in the German Press: 1 In declarations of.the former German Chancellor Michaelis, one reads that at the time of the receipt of the Nuncio&apos;s letter Erzberger already knew of the letter. The Nuncio feels hound to state that Erzberger was certainly not informed by him of the contents of the letter.&apos;&quot;Cardinal Hartmann (Cologne).-The Cardinal Secretary of State is represented by German Wireless (July 30th) as having denied, definitely the rumour that the Belgian authorities have brought about the recall of Cardinal Hartmann.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.Copies of the following papers have been received : Peace Conference.

APPENDIXTOWestern and General Report No. 131.JAPANESE  DECLARATION OF POLICY.. Tlie Japanese Embassy in London informs us that Viscount Uchida, Minister for Eoreign Affairs, made the following statement on Saturday :  &quot; It appears that, in spite of the official statement which the Japanese Delegation at Paris issued on May 5th last, and which I fully endorsed in an interview with the representatives of the Press on May 3 Tl.li, Japan&apos;s policy respecting the Shantung question is little understood or appreciated abroad.&quot;It will he remembered that, in the ultimatum which the Japanese Government addressed to the German Government on August 15th, 1914, they demanded of Germany to deliver on a date not later than September 15th, 1914, to the Imperial authorities without condition or compensation the entire leased territory of Kiaochow, with a view to the eventual restoration of the same to China. The terms of that demand have never elicited any protest on the part of China or any other Allied or Associated Powers.&quot; Following the same line of policy, Japan now claims as one of the essential conditions of peace that the leased territory of Kiaochow should be surrendered to her without condition or compensation. Ar. the same time, abiding faithfully by the pledge which she gave to China in 1915, she is quite willing to restore to China the whole territory in question ami to enter upon negotiations with the Government at Peking as to the arrangements necessary to give effect to that pledge as soon as possible after the Treaty of Versailles shall have been ratified by Jnpan; Nor has she any inteution to retain or to claim any- rights which affect the territorial sovereignty of China in the Province of Shantung.&quot; The significance of the clause appearing in Baron Makiho&apos;s statement of May 5th that the policy of Japan is to hand back the Shantung Peninsula in full sovereignty to China, retaining only the economic privileges granted to Germany must be clear to all. Upon an arrangement being arrived at between Japan and China for the restitution of Kiaochow, the Japanese troops at present guarding that territory and the Iviaochow-Chinan-fu Railway will be completely withdrawn. The Kiaoehow-Ghinan-fu Railway is intended to be operated as a joint Chiho-Japanese enterprise without any discrimination in treatment against the people of any nation.&quot; The Japanese Government have, moreover, under contemplation proposals for the establishment in Tsing-tao of a general foreign settlement instead of the exclusive Japanese settlement which hy the agreement of 1915 with China they are entitled to claim.&quot;   (From The Times, August 6th, 1919.)
