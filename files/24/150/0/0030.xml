WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.ALLIED  GROUP.CHINA.Japanese Relations. Sir J. Jordan lias received reports from Shanghai that all shops and markets are closed, and from Tientsin that the local bankers have resolved to prohibit all further transactions in yens (June 9tlP. In conjunction with his French and American colleagues Sir J. Jordan decided, on June .10th, to send a telegram to the British Consul-General at Shanghai, asking him to impress upon the leaders of the agitation the necessity for refraining from all action which would alienate the sympathy of the three Powers, especially as the strikers&apos; chief demand,&quot;the dismissal of the pro-Japanese Tsao Ju Lin, had been acceded to.On June 10th Sir J. Jordan reported that the whole Cabinet was believed to have tendered its resignation to the President, and that the President himself intended to resign. The military party, headed by Tuan Chi Jui, were deeply incensed at the dismissal of the pro-Japanese officials, and Avere leaving nothing undone to secure the succession for themselves. According to reliable information, agents of Tuan Chi Jui and of the late President Ting were fomenting trouble in Shanghai to that end.On June 12th Sir J. Jordan appreciated the political situation as follows. General Hsu Shi Cheng is the real leader of the military party, which is closely identified with the military party in Japan. Its accession to power would, therefore, only perpetuate the anti-Japanese movement. Further, it would cause a definite break with the South and place China under a military dictatorship. The best elements, however, are rallying round the President, though they rely on British, American and French support. The latter can only be given at the expense of Japanese resentment. Sir J. Jordan considers the Chinese problem a world one, and advocates free and open discussion between the Powers.After a sharp conflict between demonstrators and police on June 12th the situation at Shanghai has gradually improved. Shops have- reopened, and detained ships have sailed (Sir J. Jordan, June 13th), but intense anti-Japanese feeling still exists (June 16th).A Foreign Office telegram (Juue 17th) states that a Memorandum has been given to the Chinese Delegation in Paris containing the assurances given to the Supreme Council of the Allies by Japan that Kiao Chou and the German rights in Shantung will eventually be restored to China.According to the latest telegram received from Sir J. Jordan, the President has sent a message to Parliament in which he says that the Government has no alternative but.to sign the Peace Treaty without reservation. At the same time he admits his failure to deal adequately with the questions of the Treaty and internal peace, and therefore tenders his resignation.The resignation has not been accepted by Parliament.FRANCE.The Labour Situation. The situation is still uncertain. The metallurgical trades have resumed negotiations on the question of salaries, but no settlement has been reached. On June 12th M. Clemenceau received a delegation of the Transport, Workers&apos; who were accompanied by the Secretary of the Confederation Generale du Travail. According to a telegram from Tlie Times&apos; correspondent at Paris (Tlie Times, June 16th\ a satisfactory settlement has been made. Meanwhile, a general strike of miners is threatened. The Miners&apos; Federation is dissatisfied with the measure passed in the Chamber of Deputies on June 11th affecting the application, of the eight hours&apos; day in mines, though this measure differs only slightly, viz., in. the method of time-keeping, from the original text of the Bill which passed its first reading on the previous day and with which the miners were satisfied.   The Confederation Generale
Odu Travail announces a general strike of miners for -Tune 16th and the Federation has issued a statement throwing upon the Chamber all responsibility.The Cartel Confederal (representative of the Federation of Miners, Sailors, Dockers, Transport-workers, Metal-workers, and Builders) has issued a statement, supporting the miners and denouncing (1) the delay in making peace; (2) the increased cost of. living; (3) the threat of new taxes on consumable goods ; (4) the attempt to strangle the Russian and Hungarian Revolutions ; (5) the delay in the questions of demobilisation aud amnesty.The Confederation Generale du Travail, while condemning the increased cost of living, the closing of the frontiers, the lack of food products and raw material, and the disorganisation of transport, appears to feel some apprehension of becoming the tool of the extreme Socialists and thus alienating public opinion. Its representatives do not appear to be working in complete accord with the Socialist Party (Lord Derby, June 11th, 12th and 13th).Lord Derby reports that the transport strike is over. Negotiations between the Miners&apos; Federation and the Ministry of Labour have failed, the Federation insisting on the original (Dnrafour) Bill respecting the eight hours&apos; day which was amended by the Chamber owing to Government opposition (June loth). -Franco-Italian Syndicalist and Socialist Meetings. The Franco-Italian Syndicalist and Socialist meetings were held at Paris on June 14th. Au account of the former issued by the Confederation Generale du Travail states that its object is to agree on common action for moral aims, viz., peace with Russia and Hungary, &quot;demobilisation and amnesty ; and that its decisions are to be communicated to the parallel Socialist Conference.The Petit Parisian states that the Socialist Delegates have appointed a committee of three, consisting of Messrs. Albert Thomas, Longuet, aud Frossard, to establish contact between them and the Syndicalists.ITALY.Political Situation. Sir R. Rodd foresees that when the Chamber meets on June I9th, the President of the Council will be confronted with serious difficulties. Many factors are conspiring against him, the most formidable beiug the German sympathisers, who may succeed in uniting the old Giolittian majority in the Chamber into a compact opposition. * German influence is gaining strength, and encouraged as it is by well-known methods of propaganda and hy many commercial and financial elements, there is grave danger of it becoming supreme.       .   -Labour Unrest. General strikes which have been organised at Milan, Turin, and Naples have so far failed. At a meeting of the Chamber of Labour on June 14th it was decided to postpone indefinitely the general strike in Rome. It was alleged as one of the reasons for this decision that the Bourgeois Press and official agencies evidently wished a strike to take place in order to bring matters to a head.Serious riots provoked by the high cost of living have been reported from Genoa Spezzia (Sir R. Rodd, June 14th and loth).JAPAN.Shipping Competition. Mr. Alston (Tokio) reports that considerable resentment is expressed on account of the alleged discrimination against Japanese shipping in Indian waters. The shipping companies, with which the Japanese Government is in sympathy, complain of (1) high tariffs, (2) the exclusion of Japanese vessels from South African routes except under the direction of two competing British companies, (3) the refusal, of clearances.PANAMA.Disturbances. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Panama has received a report from San Jose that serious disturbances broke out on June 14th. &apos; A demonstration on the part of revolutionaries resulted in the burning of the offices of the newspaper Information, the American Consulate was fired upon by the police and 20 casualties were incurred in street fighting,   British subjects are not thought to be in danger.
ENEMY GROUP.A UST RIA-H UN G A R Y.Hangar]). A telegram was sent on June 14th to the Hungarian, Czecho-Slovak, and Rumanian Governments on behalf of the Allied and Associated Governments reiterating the latteFs determination to put an end to useless hostilities. The telegram continues : &quot; They (the Allied Governments) have reason to think that the chief motive animating those responsible for what would otherwise seem senseless bloodshed is the belief that the future frontiers of the new States will be modified by the temporary accidents of military occupation. This is not so. No State will be rewarded for prolonging the horrors of war by any increase of territory ; nor will the Allied and Associated Powers be induced to alter decisions made in the interests of peace and justice by the unscrupulous use of military methods.&quot; They desire, therefore, to declare : &quot; 1. That.the frontiers described in the accompanying telegram are to be the frontiers permanently dividing Hungary from Czecho-Slovakia and from Rumania.&quot; 2. That the armed forces of these States must i mmediately cease hostilities and retire without avoidable delay within the national, frontiers thus laid down.&quot;Provision is made for any necessary local adjustments.Separate instructions follow for (I) Czecho-Slovakia to see that the Hungarian retirement is unmolested ; (2) Hungary to withdraw all troops within the frontier determined upon before June 18th. Otherwise the Allied Governments hold them-selves free to advance on Budapest; (3) Rumania to withdraw all troops within her new frontiers as soon as the Hungarian army has withdrawn from Czecho-Slovakia (Astoria, June 1-lth).Bela Kuu, in acknowledging the receipt of the above telegram, after expressing the Governments desire for the cessation of hostilities, stated : &quot; The Government of the Hungarian Soviet Republic declare without hesitation,, frankly and openly, that they will not only satisfy, but have already absolutelySOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Economic Agreement with Greece. Sir R. Rodd reports that au economic agreement has been drawn up between the Jugo-Slav and Greek Governments. The agreement includes provisions for (1) an energetic and similar maritime policy, (2) the prevention of any hegemony in the Adriatic, (3) the freedom of the seas, (-1) development of the Jugo-Slav merchant navy, (5) a common basis for a customs regime, (6) protection against foreign competition.An ultimate economic alliance is contemplated.Occupation of Klagenfurt. The J ugo-Slav Government asserts that Klagenfurt was occupied as a precaution against the growth of Bolshevism in the town and to counteract Italian influence. It has expressed its readiness to conform to the decision of the Paris Conference and to hand over the town to an Allied force (Sir C. des Graz, June 12th).As a counter move Italian troops have advanced in the region of Villacco San Vita (Sir R. Rodd, June loth).UNITED STATES.The Peace Treaty. --Mr. Barclay reports that the action by the Senate in dealing with the Peace Treaty has not helped the opponents of the League. The Press characterises the Senate&apos;s publication of the text as impertinent and Senator Knox&apos;s motion as &quot; sabotage.&quot; Mr. Barclay does not think that the Republican manoeuvre to separate the League from the Treaty has improved the position of the party.
satisfied, the demand of the Governments of the Allied and Associated Powers to cease hostilities. It is not we who are the cause of the bloodshed continuing, but the troops of the Czecho-Slovak Republic, who, profiting from the fact that on the demand of the Allied and Associated Powers we at once suspended warlike operations, have taken the offensive, which we were only able to repulse by counter-offensives, with the object of making their further advance henceforward impossible. In order to prove that it is not we who are responsible for the shedding of blood it is sufficient to recall that in the zone occupied by the Rumanians we have not advanced a single step, nor even made an effort to do so, in view of the fact that the Rumanians have not recommenced their attacks against us. However, we point out that, in view of the actual situation on the Czecho-Siovak front, and of the possibilities of giving orders and carrying them out, the recall of our troops aud the evacuation of the territories mentioned cannot be effected in the time fixed by your telegram. We are still less able to effect it as, although your telegram was marked &apos; Very Urgent,&apos; we did not receive it fill aaoon oia Juiae 15th.&quot;&apos;: In order to cany out the recall oE our troops and the evacuation of the territories without bloodshed on our side or on the side of the Rumanians, we have to-day invited the Governments, that is to say the Cominauders-in-Chief of the Czecho-Slovak Republic and of the kingdom of Rumania, to send to our General Headquarters, or to another place to be determined, military delegates provided with full powers who should be entrusted with the task of arranging for the withdrawal.&quot;In a Note to President Masaryk, Bela Kun states : &quot; In accordance with M. Clemenceau&apos;s demand we have taken the necessary steps and have forbidden our army to take up any aggressive attitude.&quot;The Czecho-Slovak Government, in acknowledging the a-eceipt of the Entente Note, declares that, though it is true that the Magyars did not advance beyond the original line of demarcation, they did not cease to violate it by almost daily attacks ; that agitators crossed the frontier for the purpose of stirring up the Ozocho-Slovak population to revolt; that Magyar territory was occupied, when the Rumanian advance began, in order to prevent anarchy ; and, finally, that the present Hungarian invasion had been long prepared.   The Note ends : &quot;While accepting the decision of the Peace Conference, we are not certain that the Magyars will obey it. They did trot conform to the first summons from Paris. We shall therefore be obliged to defend ourselves if they do not stop their offensive and withdraw behind the liaae of demarcation. In any case we shall demand from the Magyars that they repair the damages, refund the expenses caused by them., and restore the material stoleai from us &quot; (Prague, June 17th).According to the latest wireless reports froan Budapest and Prague, Bela Kun has addressed a message to M. Clemenceau and the Czecho-Slovak Government; to Bela Kun, each stating that orders were promptly given for the cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of troops and each claiming that attacks were launched by the enemy during the process.Soviet Congress. The first session of the Congress of Workmen&apos;s, Soldiers&apos;, and Peasants&apos; Councils opened at Budapest on June 14th. Lenin was elected Honorary President. The President of the Soviet Republic, Alexander Garbai, in his opening speech said that the task of the proletariat was to overthrow the institutions of the old class-domination. For the moment, the proletariat also was exercising class-domiaaatioaa with their dictatorship, but this was only a transitional pheaaomeiaoa, and their object was to abolish all class distinctions ; a thousand year old constitution was to-day being buried, which had only served to exploit the workers. A new constitution must be created, which should enforce the will of the workers. The speaker pointed to the positive successes which the proletariat of Hungary had won both at the front and at&quot;-home (Budapest, June 14th).German-Austria. The Vienna WorkmeiPs Council has issued a proclamation signed by Dr. Friedrich Adler, warning the working classes against attempts which are being made by anonymous pea-sons to drag them into a Communist coap cVelal. Adler declares that the Workmems Council alone is responsible for deciding on the course of political action (Vienna, June 14th).The Government has addressed a Note to the Entente representatives pointing out that the warlike operations between the Czecho-Slovak and Hungarian troops are assuming a threatening character for Austria-Hungary, and that it is therefore impossible to cany out the reduction in the strength of the Austrian Volkswehr by June 15th (Vienna, June 12th).8)94-36 B
GERMANY.Political Situation. (1) General. According to Sir W. Townley (Tlie Hague) the consensus of opinion seems to he that the Germans will sign the Treaty, especially if the Entente Powers show no tendency to be lenient, He thinks that the situation may be best, summed up in the advice which the German Minister at the Hague claims to have given to Count Brockdorff-Rautzaii: &quot; Delay negotiations as much as you can. Time is on the side of Germany, and the longer the negotiations hang on the better the chance that the Allies will not hold together, or that the peoples of the Entente countries will not allow their Governments to push things to extremities.&quot;Sir W. Townley learns from a reliable informant that the population of Berlin is spending its time gambling and dancing without paying any attention to work.Lord Acton is in receipt of information to the effect that, if the Government signs the Treaty, the Independents are expected to attempt a revolution. At the same time a report that the Government is concentrating Army doctors at. a point in South Germany for the reception of German prisoners from Prance may indicate that signature is contemplated.In a wireless report of June 14th Emil Barth denies the statement that he entered into negotiations on behalf of the Independent Socialists with military units for the purpose of overthrowing the Government. A further report states that the Com-rnunists and the Independent Social Democrats have been endeavouring during the last few weeks to procure a large quantity of arms, and to corrupt soldiers and non-commissioned officers entrusted with the protection of the Government. At the same time strong Communist propaganda was commenced among railway workers and officials. Attempts on the part of Communists to influence the guards who have been placed in the railway stations for the protection of materials and food, have been observed.It is worthy of notice at the present stage of the Peace negotiations that several organs of the German Press are again drawing attention to the danger of a Spartacist outbreak.(2) Saxony. A telegram from Dresden to the Kolnische Zeitung (June 10th) states that the Spartacists and Independents are preparing another attempt to overthrow the Government. To this end they are working up the industrial population of the countryside and the small towns, and a number of local strikes owe their origin to this agitation. They are particularly spreading the suspicion that the Government is dispersing the militia (Sicherheitstruppen), and is replacing it by bourgeois and students.(3) Brunswick. The fraction of the Independent Socialists in Brunswick have decided to break with the Socialists of the Right, The resignation of the Independent Socialist Ministers is being considered (Nauen, June 15th).(4) Lihbeck. In consequence of underfeeding, disturbances broke out in lubeck  on June 14th, which led to looting of numerous hotels, restaurants and food shops. The intervention of organised workers who undertook the protection of restaurants, put ah end to the looting (Nauen, June 15th).(5) Wilrtemberg. The Gollinger. Freic V olkszeitung learns from a reliable source that at a meeting of the Communists on Juno 5th the establishment of a Wtirtemberg Soviet Republic was decided on (Nauen, June 16th).(6) Berlin. There is a newspaper.strike.Heeling of Socialist Parties at Weimar. According to a German Wireless Report of June 13th, at the meeting of the representatives of all the German Socialist Parties at Weimar, lierr Scheidemann criticised openly the half measures which characterised the policy of the Independents, and expressed no desire to win them back into union with the Majority Socialists by making concessions to their programme. His speech was greeted with much applause.The hardest blow was struck at the Independents by the revelations of Noske. The latter declared that the Independents maintained relations with the cavalry division of the Gardeschutzen in Berlin, in order to make use of them for overthrowing the Government.In connection with SeheidemamFs speech the Social Democratic Congress adopted a resolution expressing its indignation at the intentions of the Entente to impose a Peace of violence on the German people which would hinder their cultural development and render impossible their political existence.   Such Peace conditions
would be irreconcilable with Wi.lson&apos;s principles ; they would also be irreconcilable with the principles of the International decisions reached at the Conferences at Berne and Amsterdam. The Congress takes up its stand on the resolutions of the International Socialist Conference held in February of this year and greets the spirit which animated it as a very satisfactory sign for the linking up of International relations between the Socialist proletariat and as a means for common action of Socialist parties in the great interests of the Peace of Nations and the liberation of the working classes.The Congress declared that all Governments had their share in responsibility for the war but that the German invasion of Belgium and Prance threatened the existence of nations and undermined belief in treaties. It adopts the proposal of the Government to establish an impartial neutral tribunal for the consideration of the causes and conduct of the war.The Palatinate.-All the Palatinate deputies, with the exception of Klement, who had been arrested by the French, have addressed a manifesto to the electors, in which they state that they wish to face in common with their German brethren the difficulties which have come upon them. The union of the Palatinate with Germany must remain unaltered. No new State, whether it be a Palatinate, a Hessian, or a Rhenish Republic, will be supported at present by the deputies. The Palatinate must be allowed free exercise of the right of self-determination (Nauen, June I5th).Poland. Sir P. Wyndham (Warsaw) reports that the situation on the Posen and Silesian frontier is serious. The Polish population is retaliating against German provocation, and the position is described as differing little from a state of Avar. Fears are expressed that it may prove impossible to control the Polish Army in the event of a rising in the provinces still occupied by Germany.The German Armistice Commission, on the other hand, complains in a note to Marshal Foch that great excitement has been aroused, especially in the Eastern Provinces of Germany, by the concentration of a part of. General HalleFs Army on the eastern frontier (Nauen, June 14th):NEUTRAL GROUP.THE BALTIC PROVINCES.German Aggression. Colonel Tallents has arranged an armistice at Weuden between the Bait Landwehr and the Esthonians, though no permanent settlement has been reached.The Landwehr is rumoured to have formed a plan to induce the Northern corps and Bait battalions to displace the Esthonian GoArernment, but the Commander of the Northern corps has disclaimed all connection with the Germans (Mr. Bosancpuet, June 14th).Mr. Grant Watson reports that active German propaganda is being carried on, especially against the Esthonians, who are accused of being Bolsheviks, and against the Poles.The Germans have greatly improved the railway line between Memel, Hitau, and Riga.The following telegrams have been exchanged between General von der Goltz and General Gough.From General von der Goltz : &quot;According to proclamations which have been found the Commander-in-Chief in North Li viand is placing masses of Bolsheviks to fight against the Landwehr and Imperial German troops. I must therefore regard his troops as Bolsheviks, that is as 1113&apos; enemies, and act accordingly.&quot;Prom General Gough: &quot;With reference to your radiogram of June loth addressed, to the Commander-in-Chief of the Esthonian Army you are reminded that an armistice exists between the troops under the command of Major Fletcher and the Esthonian forces. Any action on your part such as that contemplated in 3&apos;our above radiogram will be interpreted as an open and direct defiance of the Allied and Associated Governments. General Gough.&quot;
sMr. Bosanquet urges that orders be issued immediately to the German Govern-ment to direct von der Goltz (1) to obey the instructions on military matters issued to him by the Allied Missions ; (2) to cease all action against Esthonians and Letts ; (3) to commence the evacuation oi Latvia and Lithuania by half his troops without delay.Arrangements are reported to have been made for the despatch of a large number of Russian officers and men, equipped by Germany, to join Prince Lieven&apos;s force, which forms a part of the Bait Landwehr. Mr. Grant Watson points out the danger of German control of these troops.The Lettish Journalist, Mr. P. Aschmans, states in an interview with the Social Dcmokratcu published on June lGlh that the drafting of German troops from the army of occupation into the &quot; Baltisches Landwehr &quot; and the &quot;German Colonisation &quot; plans in Lett!and are part of a scheme for bringing the Baltic Provinces under German influence. He says that the Germans in Lettland are eagerly engaged in transporting by rail masses of timber and other material to Germany, that they entrust administrative and. other posts only to Baltic Barons and Lettish renegades,; and that only Germans are in charge of the administration of Riga. He asserts that the Germans are occupying districts previously freed from Bolsheviks by Lettish troops, and that the German army of occupation (masked as Lettish troops) may be used to support a reactionary movement in Germany (Sir C. Ivennard, June 16th).Sir C. Marling reports that the German Legation at Copenhagen has published a communique stating that German Empire troops took no part in the attack on Wend en, which they allege was clue to Esthonian troops attacking the Lettish Baltic Landwehr with the object of reinstating the Ulmanis Government.MEXICO.Revolutionary Activity. The capture of Chihuahua is not confirmed. The State Department at Washington does not consider the Angeles movement serious. Villa is reported to be marching against Juarez and in case of necessity United States troops will be&apos;despatched across the frontier to occupy the town (Mr. Barclay, June 12th).Mr. Cummins reports that the destruction of trains by the rebels has recently averaged one per day.According to the latest telegrams published in The Times, American troops took possession of Juarez in retaliation for continual firing by Villa&apos;s troops into El Paso, on the American side of the border. They were subsequently withdrawn (Washing-ton, June 17th).NETHERLANDS.Wynkoop and the Extremists. According to the Home Office Review of Revo-revolutionary Movements Abroad (G.T. 7464, June 12th), Wynkoop is much pleased at the results of the latest municipal elections, in which six Communists were elected for Amsterdam. He is violently opposed to Troelstra, whom he accuses of working in the interests of the bourgeoisie.There appears, to be general confidence that the Burgerwacht is equal to any call that may be made upon it, and, knowing this, the extremists are unlikely to become violent,NORWAY.Labour and Russia.-According to a telegram from Christiania to the Politiken (Stockholm), the Norwegian Seamen&apos;s Unions have decided upon a resolution in favour of blockading the enemies of the Soviet Republic. The Trades Unions have promised to support the movement and the co-operation of British, Swedish and Danish labour organisation is solicited (Sir C. Kennard, June 13th).SPAIN.Political Situation. A Memorandum (G.T. 7455) on the Political Situation has been drawn up by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office. After recapitulating the Ministerial history of Spain during the last ten years in order to
illustrate tlie instability of Spanish Governments, the writer points out that few or none of the Cabinet crises were occasioned by a defeat or with a threatened defeat in the Cortes, which has played a very secondary role in directing the course of events.The dominant powers in the country are, first, the King, who exercises real power through his occasional direct interference, and more by his great power of influencing all the leaders of the old parties ; secondly, the leaders of the various political groups, of whom there may now be said to be some six or eight and who are for the most part rather practised players of the game of intrigue and self-interest than standard-bearers of any definite political principle; and thirdly and most important, of all, the Army. It has been one or other of these three causes, ministerial intrigue, royal initiative, or military threats, which has caused all the ministerial crises. And outside these three forces there is the revolutionary element taking shape in Republicanism, Socialism and Syndicalism, which have only a small representation in the Cortes, but are able to affect the fates of Ministers by creating disturbances out of doors, it was these last two, the Army and Syndicalism, which, working ih opposition to each other, overthrew Count Romanones.Sehor Maura&apos;s Cabinet which succeeded Count Romauones was avowedly reactionary, and its real leader was Sehor Cierva, who is supported by the Army. Seilor Maura resigned owing to the impossibility of carrying the Finance Bill through Parliament, and, in his determination to return with a working majority, he resorted to all the old abuses in conducting the elections. This, and his avowed intention of governing in a reactionaiy spirit, has caused a union between all the elements of the Left, who have agreed to combine in order to make the work of the new Cabinet impossible. In reply to this there is a modified alliance between Senor Dato, the leader of the official Conservative Party, and the Prime Minister, but both on the Right aud on the Left personal jealousies make union difficult and insecure.The writer of the Memorandum prophesies that the fall of Romanones and the accession to power of Maura and Gierva at the scarcely disguised dictation of the Army have made inevitable within a comparatively short time the raising of the direct issue Avhether Spain is to be governed by Parliamentary and constitutional and more or less liberal principles, or whether it is to become once more a military absolutism.The mere maintenance of order has no issue, and unless after a time the King or Maura pluck up the courage to deal with the urgent problems of political, social, and enonomic reform, which can probably only be handled after first subduing the bullies of the Army, they must sooner or later, it would seem, find themselves face to face with a wave of popular agitation in which the whole system they represent, even the Monarchy itself, may only too probably be engulfed.SWEDEN.The Extreme Socialist Party. The following telegram, dated June 16th, has been received from Sir C. Kennard (Stockholm) :  &quot; The Extreme Socialist Party at their Congress on June 14th passed a resolution to the following effect by 132 votes to G9 : &apos; The Party is revolutionary both in aims and means. It warns the working classes against bourgeois democratic reforms. The Party considers the dictatorship of the proletariat as a necessary transition to socialism. It will continue to take part ih order to protect the interests of the working classes, but the Congress insists that parliamentary business must be entirely subordinated to the action of masses. A Socialistic constitution must be based on Workmen&apos;s and Peasants&apos; Councils. The working classes must be prepared to meet force by force, but [the Party deprecates all aimless violence and &quot;individual&quot; terrorism. The bourgeois classes must be disarmed. The Party must reject all parliamentary grants for military purposes. It supports the formation of Soldiers&apos; Councils and intends to carry out anti-militaristic propaganda in the army.&apos; &quot;The Congress acclaimed the foundation of the Third International and decided to join it without reservation by 124 votes to S4.SWITZERLAND.Communist Party. The various Swiss Communist groups recently held a congress at Bienne and there decided to create a Communist Party for the whole of Switzerland, with its headquarters at Zurich (Lord Acton, June 9th).8194-36 C
lliots at Zurich. Lord Acton reports that severe rioting took place at Zurich during the night of: June 1.3th to 14th on the occasion of a demonstration held in memory of Rosa Luxembourg. The crowd attacked the prison and succeeded in releasing a man named Wyss, who had been arrested a few days earlier on entering Switzerland from Germany on the charge of carrying a large quantity of Bolshevist money and literature. Disorders ceased about 2 a.m., and since that time complete calm has reigned. The Cantonal police tried to withstand the mob, but the municipal police, whose chief is a socialist, do not appear to have intervened. Lord Acton believes that German agents organised the riot, which occurred immediately after troops had been withdrawn from Zurich on the representation of the Socialists.The Vorarlberg. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed the French Minister at Berne that since the publication of the Peace Terms for Austria, the proportion of the population in the Vorarlberg in favour of union with Switzerland has increased to over 95 per cent. (Lord Action, June 18th).PEACE DISCUSSIONS.&apos; Handbooks prepared in the Historical Section of the Foreign OjJice.-The following, received up to June 19th, should be added to the lists given in previous Reports : F.O.
