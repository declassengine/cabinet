WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Bolshevism. This subject is dealt with under China (Repatriation of Coolies), Germany, Baltic Provinces, Denmark (Rouble Notes), and Spain.Food Belief to Germany. The Allied Blockade Committee has authorised the despatch of &quot;30,000 tons of bacon and 6,SS0 tons of condensed milk to Holland for immediate re-export to Germany.The Shipping Controller has been asked to provide additional tonnage for relief to European countries including Germany. He points out the difficidty of complying with this request without either rescinding tonnage agreements with France and Italy or requisitioning vessels which have been granted licences for other purposes. He suggests that the United States should be approached as beiug in possession of sufficient shipping and free from obligations to the Allies.Exports from Holland to Luxemburg. The Allied Blockade Committee reports as follows (March 1st) : The Commission for the left bank of Rhine has decided that imports into and exports from the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg will be regulated by the Inter-Allied Economic Committee at Luxemburg with the help of repre-sentatives of local interests. Every effort will be made to facilitate the economic reconstruction of the country, subject to guarantees against re-export.Relaxation of Trade Restrictions. The following resolution of the Blockade Council has been agreed to : &quot; Goods included on the Free List prepared by the Associated Governments for Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland and Switzerland shall be permitted to go freely to individuals or firms whose names appear upon the Confidential Black Lists of the Associated Governments for the five above-mentioned neutral countries.Lord Granville (Athens) has been informed that trade may be resumed between Great Britain and Jugo-Slavia, Dalmatia, Montenegro, Albania, Czecho-Slovakia, Bosnia, and Herzegovina.Cable Censorship. An agreement has been reached between the Governments of Great Britain and the United States for regulating the censorship of telegrams passing-be tween the two countries (Astoria, February 28th).Propaganda, in Foreign Countries. Attention is directed to a Memorandum (G. 236) issued by the President of the Board of Education recommending the British Governments support for the maintenance of the British Institute at Florence and for the establishment of British educational institutions at Athens.German Foreign Securities. With regard to the instructions issued to His Majesty&apos;s representatives in neutral countries dealing with the disposal of enemy property (vide Report No. 107, page 2), Sir M. Findlay reports that the Norwegian Finance Department has issued a circular to Banks and Stock Exchanges, bringing to their notice the conditions as to the transfer by Germans of their securities. The Note states that no effective means exist of preventing transactions of this character, and makes a reservation in connection with agreements of a financial nature between belligerents which may affect the already acquired rights or legitimate interests of Norwegian subjects.Sir H. Rumbold doubts whether satisfactory results will be obtained without the co-operation of the Swiss Government and of the National Bank. The Federal Council takes the view that the responsibility for ensuring the observance of the clauses she has signed must be left to Germany. Sir 11. Rumbold suggests that the German Government should cause to be drawn up a full list of all property belonging to the German State or German subjects in Switzerland.
ALLIED  GROUP.BRAZIL.Candidate for Presidency. The National Convention has selected Dr. Epitacio Possoa as candidate for the Presidency by 139 votes as against 43 votes received by Dr. Ruy Barbosa (Sir A. Peel, February 26th).CHINA.Repatriation of Chinese Coolies from Russia. The United States Government considers it very inadvisable at this time to assist the repatriation of Chinese workmen and coolies who have been under the influence of Bolshevism in Russia (Lord Reading, March 1st).National Defence Bureau. Sir J. Jordan (March 4th) has asked the Japanese Minister at Peking to join in representations for the disbandment of the new National Army, but latter has applied for instructions as to the action he should take in the matter.   (See Report No. 1 OS, page 3.)Peace Conference at Shanghai. Sir J. Jordan reports (March 2nd) that the Peace Conference at Shanghai has come to a deadlock over the situation in the Province of Shensi. The Southern delegation accuse the Northern delegation of having violated the conditions of an armistice mutually agreed upon, and have appealed to Sir J. Jordan and the Allied Ministers to make representations to the Peking Plenipotentiaries to secure observance of the armistice and the dismissal of the Military Governor responsible for its violation. Sir C. Greene (March 4th) finds that the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Japan, is not pessimistic as to the present deadlock which he believes will be solved.FRANCE.French Public Opinion.-Nn. important Memorandum (G.T. 0868) on &quot; Currents of Opinion in France&quot; has recently been issued by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office.Morocco : Abrogation of Act of Algeciras. On March 3rd, Lord Derby drew attention to an article in Temps on the question of Morocco as affected by the Treaty of Peace, in which it is admitted that France would like to see other Powers agree to the abrogation of the Act of Algeciras, and in regard to this question she will first approach her Allies and the neutrals. According to Temps, France will adopt an uncompromising attitude only on one point, i.e., Tangier, which must form part of French Morocco.Proposed Sinking of German Fleet. The proposal put forward by a section of the English Press for the sinking of German warships has drawn protests from several French newspapers. Temps suggests that the fairest method of disposing of the ships is to divide&apos; them among the Allies in proportion to their losses and inability to undertake new construction during the war. Lord Derby (February 26th) considers that the proposed sinking of these ships will be regarded in France as an unfair attempt on the part of Great Britain to maintain her present naval superiority over that country.Franco-German Frontier. Lord Derby (March 2nd) called attention to French Press articles on this question.Attitude towards Germany. On March 3rd Lord Derby quoted from an article by &quot; Pertinax &quot; in Echo de Paris, drawing attention to the growing strength of revo-revolutionary forces in Germany. The writer considers it vitally important for France to see that those forces do not get the upper hand and urges that supplies be sent to Germany without delay.
ITALY.Threatened Shortage of Goal. The Italian Minister of Transports has informed Sir R. Rodd (February 28th) that the Ministry of Shipping has had to cancel, presumably owing to the strike, the sailing of a number of ships carrying coal to Italy, which will mean that by the end of March there will no coal at all in that country. The hope was expressed that some of the tonnage of the Allied forces which had been allotted to the Italian coal service might be sent to America to load coal there (Sir R. Rodd, March 1st).Italian Parliament. Parliament re-assembled on March 1st. In his declaration the President of the Council summarised the work of the Peace Conference, and in referring to Italian aspirations, he upheld the justice of the aim to reunite lands and peoples of Italian tradition and to establish the frontier which nature indicated. Sir R. Rodd states (March 1st) that, on the whole, the speech met with a cold reception.SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Fiume. The United States Ambassador in Rome has received instructions to act with His Majesty&apos;s representative regarding Fiume, and they have agreed to urge the acceptance of the recommendations made by the Commission of Allied Admirals, referred to in Western and General Report, No. 105 (page 3) (Sir R. Rodd, March 2nd). In view, however, of the altered situation at Fiume, the French Ambassador at Rome has inquired of the French Government whether it is still considered opportune to act.Montenegro. In a despatch (No. G232, dated January 9th) Earl Curzoii informs Sir C. des Graz that he has been told by the Serbian Minister in London that the Skupschina, with ouly a single dissentient voice, had declared for the abolition of the separate existence of Montenegro and its ruling House, and that this declaration represented the unanimous sentiment of the people.The United States Government adheres to its decision not to despatch American troops to Montenegro at the present time (Lord Derby, March 3rd).Serbia. The advance party of an economic mission to Serbia, consisting of seven persons under Mr. Rawlins, His Majesty&apos;s Commercial Attache for Serbia and Greece, left Paris for Belgrade on March 4th. Admiral Troubridge draws attention to the appointment of a French expert as Technical Adviser to Serbia oh all matters connected with developments of waterways (Sir C. des Graz, February 25th).UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.League of Nations. Opposition Press comment on President Wilson&apos;s speech at Boston on his return to America follows the lines previously taken. It is maintained that the draft constitution of a League of Nations entails an entangling alliance for the United States ; involves the country in European politics and endangers the Monroe doctrine. On the other hand, the Presidents Press supporters contend that if the United States refuses to join the League, she will betray her responsibilities towards the world (Mr. Barclay, February 27tb).Senator Lodge, in a speech on March 1st, vigorously attacked the proposal and urged that the draft should be amended so as to exclude the Monroe doctrine from the League&apos;s provisions (Mr. Barclay, March 1st). On March 3rd he introduced a resolution proposing that the Senate should record their view that they-felt that &quot; Nations of the world should unite to promote peace and general disarmament, and &quot; that the constitution of a League of Nations in the form now proposed by Peace &quot; Conference should not be accepted by the United States.&quot; Senator Lodge, however, failed to obtain consent for consideration of the resolution (Lord Reading, March 4th).Irish Race Convention at Philadelphia.- A Committee was appointed by the&apos; Convention to present a resolution to President Wilson demanding that self-determination be applied to Ireland, and an interview was arranged for March 4th.
Lord Reading (March -1th) has seen the President and is satisfied that he will not commit himself to bring the matter before the Peace Conference, but considers that the situation is undoubtedly being made difficult. The President and Lord Reading-agreed that it would be unwise to refuse to visor passports if applications were made by members-of Delegation wishing to proceed to Paris.Army and Navy Appropriation Bills. Lord Reading (March 3rd) anticipates that these fiills will be left over for the next Session, winch it will be necessary to call in time to enable the Bills to be passed before the end of financial year (June 30th).SNETtlY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.   -The Czecho-Slovak- Republic and Poland. Sir H. Rumbold reports that the Press Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at Warsaw has issued a statement to the effect that a meeting recently held at Prague under the auspices of Professor Masaryk and various Czech and German business men declared itself in favour of a common frontier between Czecho-Slovakia and the Ukraine. It was further stated that Ukrainian troops had arrived at Jablonkow (Silesia) commanded by German officers, who expressed their regret at arriving too late to fight against the Poles, &quot; the common enemies of the Czechs, the Ukrainians, and the Germans.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s representative at Prague reports that members of the Inter-Allied Mission arrived on February 26th. The evacuation of Teschen is being proceeded with.Danube Navigation. Sir C. des Graz reports that the Convention was signed on February 17th (vide Report No. 107, page 5, and Report No. 108, page 8). Admiral Troubridge states that navigation in Hungary, north of the occupied zone, has been suspended, and points out the advantage, under the terms of the Convention, of the re-establishment of communication both in the interest of trade and the preservation of law and order.German intrigues. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Prague states that a German emissary from Berlin has been arrested. Compromising documents were found in his possession. Several prominent Bohemian Germans have also been placed under arrest.Food Situation. A telegram has been circulated by Lord Robert Cecil repre-senting that the food situation in Austria is critical. The 21,000 tons of food delivered in January are nearly exhausted and tranquillity can only be maintained in the country with difficulty.GERMANY.Political Situation. (1) General. Sir H. Rumbold learns from a German source that the collapse of the Scheidemami Cabinet is imminent, and that its members are already negotiating with Plaase and Dittmann, the Independent Socialists, for the formation of a new Government. It is stated that these two men provide the brain power behind the Spartacus movement. The German Minister at The Hague (Sir W. Townley, March 1st) and the Swiss Minister for Foreign Affairs (Sir H. Rumbold, March 1st) endorse these views.Sir II. Rumbold is informed that it is the policy of the reactionary parties to discredit the present Government by forcing its members into the arms of the Extremists and thus to create a demand for the restoration of a Conservative and less democratic form of Government (Sir H. Rumbold, February 28th).Sir&apos; W. Townley learns from a Daily Mail correspondent, who has visited Germany, that the Scheidemann Government has no support, that its only effective7570 - .16 B
force consists in Herr Noske&apos;s army of 30,000 men, and that all classes in Germany desire an Allied occupation. Count Bernstorff is said to exercise complete control in the Foreign Office and to be working for a split between Great Britain and the United States (Sir W. Townley, March 1st).On the other hand, Sir H. Rumbold learns that in the opinion of M. Skrzynski, the Polish Under Secretary of State for Foreign A [fairs, the present situation in Germany is deceptive. Many Germans refuse to acknowledge defeat, and still entertain hopes of revenge in the near future.(2) Bavaria. Dr. Muhlon, who recently fled from Munich on account of his policy being pronounced as reactionary by the CeutralralJi of the Soldiers&apos; and \Vorkmen&apos;s Councils, has provided Sir II. Bumbold with the following information with regard to the situation in Munich. Since EisneFs assassination the CentraIrath, which is the only surviving organ of Government, has been dominated by the Bolshevik Party under the leadership of Dr. Lieven, Miihlsam, and  Landauer, supported by the worst elements among the demobilised soldiers and the civil population. A provisional dictatorship of the proletariat has been proclaimed and the ministers have been terrorised into subserviency. Lieven frankly acknowledges that his policy is directed with the object of saving the Russian revolution and establishing universal Bolshevism. Dr. Muhlon anticipates the spread of Bolshevism throughout Bavaria and thence through the whole of Germany unless the Entente supports the sober element in the north. He describes the Weimar Government as being helpless (Sir H. Rumbold, February 28th).The following information is given in the German Wireless report of March 2nd : At Munich the motion for proclaiming a Social Republic and placing the whole legislative and administrative power in the hands of Workmen&apos;s, Soldiers&apos;, and Peasants&apos; Councils, was rejected by 23-1- votes against 70. A motion was adopted that the Landtag should be adjourned. The Provisional Ministry in union with the Committee of Action will decide the date of re-meeting. &apos; The present session of the Workmen&apos;s, Soldiers&apos;, and Peasants&apos; Councils is equivalent to a Provisional National Council. For the cftnduct of business, an Executive Committee of 33 members will be elected, who in their turn may be recalled by the Provisional National Council. The Executive Committee shall elect from its number a Central Council consisting of seven members, who will be responsible to the Executive Committee and may be recalled by it. As soon as conditions allow, the National Laud Law proclaimed on February 4th will be submitted to the vote. The Central Council has discussed jointly with the parties of the Majority Socialists, Independents, and Peasants&apos; League the formation of a new Ministry. The whole Ministry will be responsible to the Central Council and to the Provisional National Council respectively.(3) Berlin.- At the sitting of the Berlin Workers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Councils of March 3rd the Communistic motion for the proclamation of a general strike was passed, after great uproar, by a bare majority against the combined votes of the Majority Social-Democrats and the Democrats. The resolution was passed owing to the support given to it by the Independent Social Democrats (German Wireless, March 3rd).The Councils demand (1) the establishment of the Council system ; (2) the liberation of all political prisoners including Ledebour and Radek; (3) the dissolution of the Volunteer Corps ; (4) the transformation of the present Courts into People&apos;s Tribunals ; (5) the trial of the Kaiser, the Crown Prince, Hindenburg, and Ludendorff.Disturbances occurred on March 3rd and 4th, chiefly in front of the Police Presidency and at the Northern railway station.A state of siege has been declared in Greater Berlin and the executive power has been transferred to Herr Noske as chief commander in the Mark of Brandenburg.Dr. Meyer, the editor of the Spartacus organ Rota Fakne, has been arrested (German Wireless, March 5th).(4) Ruhr District. Government troops entered Dusseldorf on February 2Sth.(5) Central Germany. Halle was occupied by Government troops on March 1st (German Wireless, March 3rd). The municipal elections took place without disorder. The general strike continues at Leipzig (March 4th). A. report dated March 5th states that the mob has committed excesses in both these towns, in spite of the presence of the troops.
((J) Brunswick. On February 28th the Spartacists declared the Landtag deposed and proclaimed Brunswick a Soviet Republic (German Wireless, March 2nd).(7) Baden. With the exception of Mannheim, where fighting continues between the Majority and Independent Socialists, the state of siege has been suspended by the Provisional Government (German Wireless, February 25th).(8) Konigsbcrg.-Order has been restored by Government troops (German Wire-less, March 5th).Economic Situation. Attention is drawn to a Report (G.T. G921) on the economic situation in Germany during -the period January 12th-February 12th, compiled from the observations of a number of British officers who visited some of the largest German towns. While observing that the political situation is improving owing to Herr NoskVs firm policy, the Report states that, unemployment, accompanied by a rise in the cost of living, is on the increase. The unemployed number in Berlin 200,000 ; in Hamburg, 72,000 ; in Munich, 32,000 ; in Leipzig, 22,000. The cause is ascribed to (1) rapid demobilisation, (2) dearth of raw materials, (3) reluctance on the part of capital to embark on fresh enterprise, (4) high prices and wages, (5) lack of will to work. The want of coal and transport facilities is particularly alluded to. With regard to food, the mass of the population lives upon rations insufficient to nourish the body adequately. The following dates at which supplies will be exhausted are given by the Central Food Office in Berlin : Breadstulfs, beginning of April; potatoes, end of May ; fats, end of March. It is stated that the meat ration can be continued indefinitely at the cost of slaughtering all milch cows and breeding stock. The coming harvest is expected to yield one-half of the average pre-war crop.Food- Belief. According to a member of the German Red Cross, the condition whereby Germany is to surrender her mercantile fleet and her securities abroad in return for the supply of 30,000 tons of bacon and fats will not cover the expense of feeding the whole population until the next harvest. He stated that the existence of the Government depended upon its ability to provide food, and that if it was compelled to resign the whole country would be thrown into the arms of the Spartacists (Lord Kilmarnock, March 3rd).The National Party and Great Britain. Herr Rechburg and General, von Seeckt, who represent the industrial interests in the National Middle Party, are asserted to be endeavouring to win the support of Great Britain. Their scheme includes the following points: (1) German interests overseas to be entrusted to Great Britain; (2) Germany to maintain an army on her Eastern frontier only; (3) Great Britain to guarantee German territorial integrity in the West; (4) Great Britain to provide raw materials to Germany in return for one-third of the profits as a war indemnity ; (5) Great Britain and Germany to join in raising a loan for the exploitation of the mineral wealth of Russia (Sir H. Rumbold, February 28th).Bolshevik Propaganda. The Independent Socialist Party is reported through a German source to be in possession of a large sum in gold for the purpose of conducting Bolshevik propaganda in England which is considered the mainstay of modern civilisation (Sir W. Townley, March 1st).The Constitution. The following views have been expressed in the discussion of the draft constitution. Horr Fischer (Berlin Majority Socialist) supported the Uniform State and condemned too much particularisation. The old Prussian spirit had prevented the progress of culture. He demanded more extensive autonomy for the communes and restrictions in the Presidents powers. The Workmen&apos;s Councils must suspend their activity. Herr Spahn (Christian PeopLVs Party) advocated the Federal State. Professor Delbriick called the draft a Bill for the dissolution of the German Enrpire. Herr Hinke (Independent Socialist) opposed the clause forbidding meetings being held by armed citizens. All men capable of bearing arms should be armed. He demanded the retention of the Council system. The capitalistic character of the constitution was shown by the stipulation that property could only be expropriated on payment of compensation. Herr Heine (Prussian Minister of Justice) refused responsibility for the dismemberment of Prussia. Herr Vogel (Nuremburg Social Democrat) stated that it would depend on the final settlement of the questions regarding the organisation of communications, defence and finance, whether, and in how far, the dismemberment of Prussia would be necessary in order to do away with Prussia^ hegemony.   Herr Fehrenbach (President, Centre Party) said : &quot; The idea
of permanent professional representation by a First Chamber, or the inclusion of Workmen&apos;s Councils in the Constitution, are opposed by such very serious objections that I do not think it probable the conception can be favourably received in the constitution. With regard to the maintenance of the individual rights of the Federal States, I hope, in view of the almost unanimous desire of the National Assembly, for an amalgamation of the State authority in the military aud communication systems &quot; (German Wireless reports).Ludendorff. Mr. Clive reported on February 26th that Luclendorff had left Sweden for Germany. Sir H. Rumbold learns from a Polish source that he is in close relation with the Bolshevik Headquarters Stall&apos; via Sweden.NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.Industrial Disturbance. Owing to the strike business is still suspended in the port of Buenos Aires. A rumour is prevalent to the effect that the President intends to absent himself from the capital in order to allow the Vice-President to take measures to deal with the strike (Sir R. Tower, February 26th). The Admiralty learns that the strike leaders are mostly foreigners, that the movement is assuming a revolutionary character, and that the President is subscribing to a policy of drift pending the elections (March 1st). Shipping companies refuse, to allow men to resume work except under a guarantee to relinquish the right of boycott (March 4th). Sir Pi. Tower is in favour of collective diplomatic representation to the President (March 2nd).BALTIC PROVINCES.Military Situation. (1) Esthonia. The Bolsheviks are reported to have captured villages on the Narova. In the region of Pskov they have occupied villages west of Izborsk (Russian Wireless).(2) Livonia. The Red Guards have had some successes in the region of Marienburg (Russian Wireless Report, March 3rd). A further report states that Marienbtirg itself has been occupied.(3) Courland. According to a Berlin telegram dated February 25th published in the Swedish Press, German troops have occupied Libau and Windau (Mr. Clive, February 27th).An attack against therBolshevik forces on the Libau front is reported -to have been planned for March 5th. The attacking force consists of 9,000 Germans at Weinoden, and 3,000 at Libau. The co-operation of the Lettish force has not been invited.The Baltic Barons. According to Danish and Swedish Press reports the Swedish Colonel Eclland has been arrested at Libau on the charge of conspiring with the Baltic Barons for the overthrow of the Lettish Provisional Government.Eight thousand German troops are reported to have arrived at Libau under the command of General von der Goltz (Mr. Clive, February 26th). Considerable uncertainty exists as to. the complicity of the Germans in the alleged plot of the Baltic Barons.The Lettish information bureau at Stockholm has been informed than Von der Goltz has arrested Baron von Stryk (Mr. Clive, February 27th).German Policy. A Memorandum (G.T. 6888), dated February 3 7th, has been handed to the Peace Conference by M. Poska, the chief of the Esthonian Delegation in Paris.- After alluding to the danger of a renewed Bolshevik offensive the Memorandum states that Germany has not relinquished her schemes for subjecting the Baltic Provinces to her domination. To this end she first supplied the Bolsheviks with arms and, when the Bolshevik offensive failed, attempted to conciliate Esthonia by offering to supply her with arms and funds.   Herr Winnig (Social Democrat),.
Ebertfs plenipotentiary to the Baltic Provinces, is reported to have said to the Esthonian delegates,&quot; if you do not belong to Russia, you must belong to us. Russia is our principal market and we cannot permit.you; as independent States, to separate us from her.&quot;With regard to Esthonian appeals for a loan, Mr. Balfour states that the German Government has offered a loan to all the Baltic Provinces, though at present the offer has only been accepted by the Lithuanian Government.DENMARK.Schleswig. Lord Kilmarnock has been informed through a Dauish source that if the population of Middle Schleswig was given the opportunity of expressing its views before the Peace Conference, there would in all probability be discovered a strong desire for the transference to Denmark of the whole of Schleswig as far as the Dannevirk Hue. (This line runs south-west from the town of Schleswig.) It is stated that a considerable portion of the German-speaking population would prefer annexation by Denmark, and the plea is put forward that representatives from Middle as well as from North Schleswig should accompany the Danish delegation to Paris.Rouble Notes. A Bill has been passed in the Reichstag prohibiting the import and export of rouble notes (Lord Kilmarnock, February 27th).The Government. Lord Kilmarnock reports that the Government offered its resignation to the King on March 1st. His Majesty reserved his decision. The Bill authorising a State loan had been passed by the Folkthing on February 25th by a majority of seven, but as the Landesting delayed it in Committee until the term offered by the Banks had expired, the Government withdrew the Bill on February 28th.Budget Deficit. The consent of the British Government is requested to a proposal for the sale of the total exportable surplus of Danish butter to Germany and Sweden, where a higher price can be obtained than in Great Britain, in order to help towards covering the deficit on the Budget (Lord Kilmarnock, February 27th).CoaZ. Lord Kilmarnock learns that American firms are offering coal at greatly reduced prices. Danish importers desire to buy American coal in order to safeguard themselves from the effect of strikes in the United Kingdom.-    FINLAND.Aland Islands. The representative of the Finnish Government at Berlin learns that the German Government has entered into a secret understanding with the Swedish Government in support of SwedeiPs claim to the, Aland Islands. The scheme also provides for the acquisition of Osterbotten by Sweden (Mr. Bell, February 27th).Repatriation of Finns. -Negotiations are proceeding for the repatriation of members of the Finnish Legion from the coast of Murmansk (Mr. Lindley, February 27 th).MEXICO.American Loan. Mr. Barclay learns that the amount of the loan which the Mexican Government is endeavouring to raise in the United States is 90 million dollars.   Ample security will be demanded (vide Report No. 107, page 8).Lord Reading has been informed that it is the British Governments hope that the loan will not be approved so long as British grievances remain unredressed.NETHERLANDS.Belgian Relations. A despatch dated February 20th has been received from Sir W. Townley giving the Prime MinisteFs views with regard to Belgian claims to Dutch territory. M. de Beerenbrouck stated that neither the people of Dutch Flanders nor the people of Limburg had the slightest wish to pass under Belgian rule,   lie pointed
out that 85 per cent.&quot; of the -100,000 inhabitants of Limburg and about half the 00,000 inhabitants of Zeeland belonged to the Roman Catholic Church and that the addition of this population could not be agreeable to the Belgian Liberals.Sir W. Townley states that Holland Avill not accept indemnification such as the annexation of Emden or East Friesland at the expense of Germany, since she neither desires to see her population increased by a German element nor to have a powerful enemy on her Eastern frontier.The Press has shown considerable restraint in dealing with the question, but public opinion is strongly against the Belgian claims.General von Leltow. Sir W. Townlej7 reports that General von Lettow arrived at Rotterdam on February 27th. According to Press reports he was met by the Prince of the Netherlands.NORWAY. -Herring Stocks. Negotiations are proceeding for the sale of one million barrels of herrings to Germany. Norwegians are also making enquiries with regard to the prospect of export to Esthonia, Finland, aud Poland (Mr. Balfour, February 27th).SPAIN.German Ships. Sir A.
