WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Bolshevism. Lord Curzon has circulated a Memorandum dealing with Bolshevism and British policy with regard to Russia. The Bolshevist Government realises the immediate necessity of an aggressive policy in order to spread its peculiar system through central and western Europe before the newly-formed States, such as Poland, are able to build up their own social and political structures and thus act as a barrier to the further advance of Bolshevism. This is the meaning of their feverish efforts to spread propaganda and of their military ventures in the Baltic provinces and elsewhere. The Poles have as yet neither a large army nor a strong Government. Rakovsky is trying to create anarchy in Budapest. In the Ukraine the Bolshevists are using Petlura, who is himself a Bolshevist in all but name, for their own purposes. They are also endeavouring to win the Intellectuals and Mensheviks to the Bolshevist cause. At the same time it is pointed out that this alliance, even where it exists, is superficial. The peasants show signs of unrest, while the working people have been almost destroyed as a class owing to unemployment.The Memorandum goes on to show the difficulties which stand in the way of arriving at any agreement with the Bolshevist Government, and insists on the necessity of giving moral and material support to the anti-Bolshevist Governments.Lord Kilmarnock learns that the Bolshevists are trying to send agents in the guise of journalists to the Peace Conference. He is also informed that agents are endeavouring to create agitation among Jewish workmen in the United States, who are subsequently to be sent to England.An account, issued by the Home Secretary, of Bolshevist activities in foreign countries is given in an Appendix to this Report.Repatriation of Prisoners. According to a statement issued by the Inter-departmental Committee on Prisoners of War dated January 7th, the total number of prisoners repatriated to England since the signing of the Armistice is 150,372.International Socialist Conference. The President of the Swiss Republic has informed Sir H. Rumbold that the Federal Government does not intend to put difficulties in the way of a Conference whose aim is the preparation of constructive legislation for the benefit of the working classes. It is advisable, however, that the Conference should be held in German rather than in French Switzerland, owing to the state of feeling which exists in the latter. The Swiss Government is prepared to give visas to all Socialists on whose behalf foreign Governments apply. Sir&apos; 1:1. Rumbold learns that enemy Socialists have not yet asked leave to attend the Conference in case their presence should prejudice the attitude of the Allied Socialists. It is thought that when once the Conference has been convened they will apply for visas, and that they will take the standpoint that, not being given a hearing at the Peace Conference, they are forced to put their case before the International Socialist Conference (vide &quot; Peace Discussions &quot;).Factories in occupied Germany. His Majesty&apos;s Government proposes to send experts to report on chemical and similar factories situated in that part of Germany occupied by British troops. No objection can be raised under the terms of the Armistice to this proposal with regard to factories employed on the manufacture of munitions of war, but doubts are entertained as to the inspection of those employed on the manufacture of peace commodities. It is further proposed that the information obtained will be made available for the manufacturers of all the Allied countries.Imports to Northern Neutrals. Mr. Barclay has been informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government is not disposed to favour any action which may lead to the accumulation of stocks in northern neutral, countries.   The Allied Blockade Committee has decided
oto class imports to these countries into (1) a free list consisting of unimportant articles which may not he consigned to any firm on the Statutory or Black Lists ; (2) a non-rationed list comprising goods which should, be controlled with regard to destination but not quantity ; (3) a rationed list which will be operated Tinder the agreements &apos;) obtaining in the past.ALLIED GROUP.ITALY.Jugo-Slav Relations. Sir R. Rodd has been assured that the Italian Government does not contemplate the occupation of Spalato unless such a course should prove necessary for the protection of the Italian population. The presence of an Italian gunboat in the harbour has had a tranquillisi ng effect on the Jugo-Slavs.&apos; On January 12th Sir R. Rodd reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was very anxious to prevent the absorption of Montenegro by Serbia, though he favoured the entry of Montenegro as a member of a Southern Slav Confederation (vide also under &apos;: Southern Slav States &quot;). Sir R. Rodd has been informed that Baron Sonnino might make considerable concessions with regard to Italian claims in Dalmatia, if Montenegrin independence is preserved.Signor Bissolatis Resignation. Signor Nitti,&apos; the Minister of Finance, has discussed with Sir R. Rodd the views held by Signor Bissolati which led to the latteFs resignation. Signor Nitti does not agree to the renunciation of the Brenner Pass as Italy&apos;s northern frontier. On the other hand he endorses Signor BissolatPs proposal for the cession of Dalmatia in return for Fiume, since the latter port might enter into rivalry with Trieste, while the Dalmatian coast would be defenceless against a hostile hinterland. He is also in favour of immediate concessions to Greece in Northern Epirus and the Dodekanese. In view of his moderate policy Sir R. Rodd urged on Signor Nitti the importance of his presence in Paris to counteract the excessive claims of Baron Sonnino. Signor Nitti replied that he was needed in Rome to tide over the difliculr, months until the next election, which was expected to be held in the spring or summer. On January 10th, however, his resignation was announced, though no reason has as yet been given.PORTUGAL.Political Situation. Sir L.. Carnegie reports that on January 10th the extreme Republicans, supported by naval units, initiated a revolutionaiy movement at Lisbon, which was, however, easily suppressed. The only place where the revolutionaries were still holding out on the 12th was Santarem.SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Montenegro. The French Government has handed to Lord Derby a declaration which it proposes should, be transmitted to the Serbian Government to the effect that, pending the deliberations of the Peace Conference with regard to the territorial and constitutional claims of the new States, the Allied Governments cannot recognise the somewhat drastic transformation which is implied by the union of all the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes under the House of Karageorgevitch. Sir G. Grahame points out that this note is intended to confuse the issue by merging the question of the annexation of Montenegro by Serbia into the less distinct question of the union of the three Slav races.Sir R. Rodd learns from a Montenegrin source that the Serbians engineered the elections so as to obtain a vote in favour of the union.   The subsequent revolution
(vide Report No. 101, page 4) was organised to draw the attention of the Powers to Serbian oppression. A considerable party in Montenegro, though not favourable to the King, is opposed to forced incorporation with Serbia and resents the pro-Serbian policy of the French authorities. The aim of this party is to obtain some form of confederation.UNITED STATES.British- Policy in Russia. The publication of M. Pichons statement, which is interpreted as indicating the intention of the British Government to make overtures to the Bolshevists, has been severely criticised. Resentment has been increased owing to the fact that M. Pichon&apos;s declaration was accompanied by a telegram stating that, the American delegates at Paris had no knowledge, of the proposal. The Neio York Times says: &quot;What secret aims of British policy this welcoming of red-handed enemies of human society may conceal we cannot even conjecture. But we know that it bespeaks a willingness to abandon Russia altogether and to give over to anarchy and destruction her millions of people.&quot; in view of these sentiments, interest attaches to a note which Mr. Barclay has received from the State Department stating that, while the United States Government views with interest and sympathy the efforts of Lett and Esthonian organisations to maintain their respective countries, it regrets that 3io available funds are at its disposal for the purpose of aiding them.Strike. Mr. Barclay reported on January 10th that the food situation in New York might become acute on account of 15,000 harbour workers and boatmen having gone out on strike. The employers refuse to submit the case to the War Labour Board for settlement.Mr. Gompers. Mr. Giompers, wbo is coining to Europe in order to take part in the International Labour Conference, sailed from New York on January Sth.Lower California.--On January 2nd Seuator Ashhurst introduced the following-resolution in the Senate : &quot;That the President of the United States is respectfuily requested to open negotiations with the Republic of Mexico for the purchase of the State of Lower California and for the purchase of a tract of land in the State of Sonora, Mexico, in area approximately 10,000 square miles.&quot; After considerable discussion the resolution was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.Mr. Barclay learns that the State Department deprecates any agitation which may lead to-friction with Mexico.ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.The Future of German-Austria. Sir H. Rumbold has received a communication from an agent in Vienna giving the substance of an interview with Dr. Otto Bauer, the German-A ustrian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Dr. Bauer considers that the greatest political problem confronting German-Austria is the claim of the Czechs to German Bohemia, which is inhabited by 31 million Germans. Czech rule will be a source of weakness to Bohemia and a constant cause of Nationalist agitation in German-Austria, while the loss of the German Bohemian coal-helds would have serious economic effects on Austria. With regard to future relations with Hungary and Jugo-Slavia Dr. Bauer is optimistic. Since German-Austria has lost Trieste, he advocates the internationalisation of the railway to the sea.Dr. Bauer considers any scheme of federation with Bohemia, Hungary, and Jugo-Slavia impracticable under present circumstances.   The alternative of some form of
union with Germany, especially now the old regime has disappeared, seems to com-mend itself to most German-Austrians.Dr. Bauer does not anticipate any real danger from Bolshevism, which is foreign to the national temperament, especially if food supplies are plentiful.Hungary.  Lord Derby reported on January 11th that, owing to the impossibility of the conditions with regard to Marshal von Maekensen&apos;s army being carried out by the new Hungarian Army, a French detachment of 2,000 men had been sent to Budapest.GERMANY.Political Situation.-(1) Berlin: From Press reports and German Wireless telegrams the course of events in Berlin appears to have been as follows : On January 7th the partisans of the Spartacus group seized the Brandenburg Gate and several railway stations and maintained their hold on the principal newspaper offices.- At the same time the Government began systematic preparations to envelop and defeat the insurgents. Herr Noske was put in command of the Berlin and Potsdam garrisons and by the 8th 80,000 loyal troops were reported to be in Berlin and its neighbour-hood. The Berlin students placed themselves at the disposal of the Government, while the Naval Division renounced its allegiance to Eichhorn. Excellent results were obtained from the recruiting and arming of the civil population. Having assured its ultimate success, the Government refused all offers of mediation made by the Independent Socialists unless captured buildings were evacuated and Eichhorn given up. On January 8th. the fighting, though severe, was indecisive. On the night of the. lOth/llth plans for a concentric movement against the insurgents were completed. The newspaper offices were recaptured on the 11th, and the following clay the Police Presidency and the Silesian railway station, the last strongholds of the Spartacus party, were stormed by the loyal troops.Of the Spartacus leaders, Leclebour is reported (Stockholm, January 14th) to be in prison, Liebknecht and Rosa Luxembourg to have fled,.the latter to Hamburg.Mr. Abrahamson, of the British Red Gross Commission in Berlin, gives some additional information. He states that Count Broekdorff-Rantzau, who is the one strong man in the Government, has retained office on the condition that strong measures are taken against the Spartacus group. He thinks that, though the Spartacus group has suffered temporary defeat, it will not be permanently eliminated unless the Government, can effect an improvement in tlie food conditions. Without this, he doubts whether even the troops which are at present reliable will remain loyal to the Government.(2) Wilrttemberg. The elections to the Wurttemberg Assembly have resulted in the return of 52 Social Democrats, 38 German Democrats, 31 members of the Centre Party, 25 members of the Right Bloc, and 4 Independent Social Democrats.(3) Oldenburg. Herr Ivuhnt, the Spartacus President of the Republic of Oldenburg, has been interned at Wilhelmshaven.(4) General. His Majesty&apos;s Representative at Rotterdam, in an interview with a resident of Hamburg whose information he considers reliable, was informed that the Bolshevist element in Germany did not exceed 5 per cent, of the population, but that it possessecWthe courage of fanaticism as opposed to the apathetic attitude of the mass of the population. Bremen was the chief centre of Bolshevism. Hamburg would welcome occupation by Allied troops. Financial and commercial circles, it was stated, were working for a close rapprochement with the United States.General Situation. A series of four reports have been issued dealing with the situation in Germany (G.T. 6617). Though these reports cover the period from the German collapse to the middle of December, they throw considerable light on the present situation. Though the Germans claim that they have not been defeated in the field and ascribe their downfall to the inability of the country to support the army, it is generally realised that Germany is absolutely broken. It is stated, however, that if the food supply had not given out, Germany could have fought for an indefinite period. The authority of the Soldiers&apos; and Workmen^ Councils is everywhere recognised and the old discipline has disappeared, especially with regard7185-3t B
to the relations between officers and men, but, except in two suburbs of Berlin, the soldiers are opposed to any form of Bolshevism, es]3ecially those from the East front. The whole population desires food, order and peace. Many Germans are prepared, if necessary, to welcome a British or American occupation, though strong antipathy is felt towards the French.With regard to the economic situation, the principal food supplies consist of bread (5 lbs. per week), potatoes (7 lbs. per week), and black coffee, the latter made from ground acorns. The allowance of butter is If ozs. a week, of meat   lb., but even these small quantities are frequently unobtainable. The prospects of the next year&apos;s crop are bad. Leather has practically disappeared, and boots, if obtainable, cost from 75 to 125 marks.&apos; The Germans expect to be compelled to pay a large indemnity, failing which the sources of income, mines, &amp;c, will be appropriated by the Allies.Separatism. Attention is drawn to a Memorandum (G.T. 6623) dealing with the alleged Separatist movement, in Rhenish Prussia and Westphalia. The movement is stated to be fostered by (1) the great industrialists, who wish to escape the burden of taxation and the payment of the proposed indemnities. Together with their Press organ, the Rliciniscke-Wcstfdlisehe Zeiiung, they were in 1914 opposed to resorting to war, but when once war had been declared they advocated a fight to a finish and the accmisition of Colonial and europe on territories. They now desire to secure an influential position in a Radical and Liberal Coalition, but are not looked upon with favour by the Democrats, who advocate large measures of industrial nationalisation; (2) the Catholic hierarchy and Clergy, who resent the anti-clerical policy of the Berlin Government. The Roman Catholic population now forms the backbone of the Centre Party (now called the Free People&apos;s Party). At two mass meetings held on December 4th it was resolved that &quot; the recognised representatives of the popular will of all parties on the Rhine and in Westphalia and the other lands on the Rhine should proclaim an independent Rhenish-Westphalian Republic as part of the German Empire &quot; ; (3) a general antipathy, especially among the Liberals and moderate Socialists, to Prussian methods of government and a consequent preference for a South German connection with Hesse, Baden, or Bavaria. This antipathy is increased by the fear of Bolshevism which is entertained by all parties.AYith regard to the question of separatism German &quot; Liberalism &quot; wants all Germany to be divided into a considerable number of State units, while the Roman Catholics want the units to be few. For instance, the Cologne Volkszcitung has recommended the division of Germany and German Austria into four large Republics, as follows : (1) A Rhenish-West.phalian Republic (the Rhine Province, Westphalia, Plesse-Nassau, the Grand Duchy of Hesse, Baden, the Rhine Palatinate); (2) a Danube Republic (Wurttemberg, Bavaria, German Austria) ; (3) a Central German Republic (the Central German States, the Kingdom of Saxony, Brandenburg, Silesia, Posen) ; (4) a Baltic Korth-Sea Republic (Oldenburg, Hanover, the Hansa towns, Schleswig-prolstein, Mecklenburg, Pornerania, West and East Prussia).Poland. Sir II. Rumbold has been informed through a Polish source that all parties in germany, Socialist as well as Reactionary, are unanimous in their determination to prevent the annexation of the German-Polish Provinces by Poland. At a meeting of the party chiefs held by the last Chancellor, Prince Max of Baden, Herr Ebert is reported to have said that even if Germany lost Alsace-Lorraine and her Colonies, she would be able to increase her influence to the East ancLSouth, and with an accession of strength in these directions she would be able in the future to reconquer what she has now lost. If Poland annexed these provinces, Germany would lose the key to the East and in the East lay her sole hope for the future. In addition to these considerations she would be compelled to buy coal and wheat from Poland.The Workmen^ and Soldiers&apos; Councils are issuing pamphlets explaining that, without her Polish Provinces, Germany will remain the tributary of her enemies with regard to her food supply. Both the Socialist masses and the Pan-Germans under the leadership of Heydebranclt are organising themselves to defend the Provinces.
NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.Strikes. Many strikes have broken out during the past week in Buenos Aires, and the movement threatens to assume a revolutionary character. On January 10th Sir R. Tower reported that considerable casualties had occurred, 40 persons being killed and many Avounded. Traffic was completely paralysed and business suspended. On the 12th Sir R. Tower was informed that Senor Vasena, of the Argentina Iron and Steel Company, where the movement originated, had accepted all the terms of the strikers. No resumption of work, however, took place and the railway strike -even extended. The Government is reported to be taking strong measures against the anarchist elements, with the result that further heavy casualties have been incurred.BALTIC . PROVINCES.Estlionia. The situation is distinctly more favourable to the Esthonians. Severe lighting is reported to have taken place in the neighbourhood of Charlottenburg and Taps without resulting in any further Bolshevist advance in the direction of Reval. According to a Helsingfors telegram (January 12th) an Esthonian force landed in rear of the Bolshevist army between Narva and Kundo, and drove the enemy south-wards with the loss of 200 prisoners. A telegram from Stockholm (January 13th) states that the Esthonians have retaken Wesenburg (on the Reyal-Narva railway), and are advancing eastwards. Finnish volunteers participated in these operations. On the southern front the Red Guards have been driven back to Tabbifer (north of Dorpat). Further Avest, the Bolshevists are operating in the direction of Fellin (east of Pernau).Mr. Menning, the Esthonian delegate at Copenhagen, has again called Lord Kilmarnock&apos;s attention to the necessity of sending food supplies to Esthonia if internal troubles are to be prevented. He pointed out the grave situation caused by the Bolshevist successes at Riga, and requested that some Held guns might be despatched to Esthonia from Murmansk.Gourlancl. According to a Russian Wireless report Bolshevist troops captured Mitau on January 10th.Lord Kilmarnock points out the necessity of preventing Libau from falling into the hands of the Bolshevists. If Libau falls, Lithuania Avill be cut off from the north. The town is held by a garrison of some 800 Germans, and Lord Kilmarnock suggests that these should be reinforced. So far, how\reArer, the attitude of the Germans has been consistently hostile to every national movement in the Baltic Provinces.It Avas reported through the same source that preparations were being made throughout Courland for convening a Congress of Lettonian Soviets at Riga on January 10th.   Lenin has. been iDvited to attend.DENMARK.German Goal. Lord Kilmarnock has been informed that in view of the sympathetic attitude taken by Denmark towards prisoners of Avar AArho have been repatriated through that country the Associated Governments have decided to make an exception to the terms of Article 6 of the Armistice by granting special permission for 47 German vessels now lying in German harbours loaded Avith coal to proceed to Denmark on condition that a precedent is not created and that no conditions are imposed by Germany as to the use of the coal.FINLAND.Food Supplies. Mr. HooA^er has authorised the export of 11,000 tons of cereals to Finland from either Sweden or Denmark.   Meanwhile the Finnish Government
has transmitted a note to His Majesty&apos;s Government drawing attention to the vital importance of the immediate importation of foodstuffs into Finland. The note declares that there is no shipping available for the transport of supplies and requests that the Finnish Government may be allowed to purchase a certain amount of tonnage for this purpose. The French Government, however, has raised objections to^grain bein&quot;- sent to Finland. Lord Derby has been instructed to urge upon the French authorities the need for supporting Finland which now constitutes the chief buttress aeainst Bolshevism in the Baltic countries.LUXEMBURG-.&apos; Political Situation. Sir F. Villiers (Brussels) gives the following account of the political revolution. On a proposal made by a Liberal member for the abdication of the Grand Duchess and her family,. 22 members of the flight withdrew from the Chamber. The Socialists then, proposed the establishment of a Republic which was carried by 16 votes to 11. (Sir F. Villiers subsequently reported that after the with-! drawal of the Right the proposal for the abdication of tho Grand Duchess was carried unanimously.) A Committee of Public Safety was then formed on which Socialists and Liberals were both represented. This was replaced on January 10th by a purely Socialist Committee, and on the same clay the Grand Duchess abdicated in favour of her sister, Princess Charlotte. French troops which occupy the capital have prevented the Committee from gaining access to public buildings or to the Palace where the Chamber is sitting. Meanwhile the Belgian Government has informed the French Government that it relies on the latter&apos;s refusal to any request for annexation by France which may be lodged by the Luxemburg Socialists. It has also appealed for British support against French claims. A French invitation to the Belgians to occupy a small district in the north of the Grand Duchy has been refused.NETHERLANDS.Austro-llungarian Shipping. The Netherlands Government has been informed that in view of the immediate necessity of alleviating the sufferings of a large part of Europe the Associated Governments have agreed to utilise merchant vessels which were flying the Austro-Hungarian flag at the outbreak of hostilities. The Netherlands Government is therefore requested to give every assistance in bringing these vessels into service as soon as possible.SPAIN.Bofohevism.-The Spanish Government has agreed to accept the co-operation of British officials in the control of Bolshevism. Similar measures have been taken in Holland and Switzerland (vide Report No. 101).Enemy Shipping. Sir A. Hardinge understands that the French and Italian Governments are prepared to show a conciliatory attitude to the Spanish claim to the seven ships ceded by Germany in compensation for losses sustained by Spanish shipping. The United States Ambassador proposes that on the renewal of the armistice with Germany a condition should be inserted providing for the surrender of all enemy vessels lying in Spanish ports other than the seven claimed by Spain. He further suggests that the latter should be used by Spain pending a final decision by a properly constituted International Court as to their ultimate allocation.SWEDEN.Ludendorff. The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Mr. Clive on January 11th that Ludendorff came to Sweden via Denmark at the end of November, having obtained a false passport from the Finnish Legation at Berlin.   Ludendorff has stated
that he is not seeking an asylum in Sweden and that lie intends to return to Germany after the National Assembly has been established. In view of this statement the Swedish Government has given him permission to remain another month in Sweden. Mr. Olive previously reported that Liberal and-Socialist papers had expressed a hope that Ludendorff would be requested to leave the country.SWITZERLAND.Economic Agreement. Mr. Barclay reports that the Swiss Minister at Washington has accepted all the terms of the economic agreement, -which has been the subject of negotiation during the past months, with the exception of the clauses providing loans to Great Britain and France. The French Government insists upon the loan, and Mr. Barclay considers that it would welcome the failure of the negotiations at Washington and their transfer to Paris. It is the policy7 of the Swiss Government, on the other hand, to withhold the loan in order to obtain a weapon by which to secure a supply of coaL and steel from the occupied districts of Germany.Industrial Depression. -Sir II. Rumbold reported on January 9th that 53 per cent, of the embroidering machines at St. Gall were lying idle while the remainder were only7 allowed to work at a maximum of 40 hours a week. Since January -hid some 12 of the largest factories have been forced to restrict their working time to four hours a day, and it is anticipated that they will, be closed down in the near future.The silk industry has suffered similarly, and it is estimated that by the middle of February7 0,500 employees will be out of work. The danger of an increase in unemployment is alluded to in Report No. 90.The German Legation. Sir II. Rum bold learns that owing to semi-official representations made by the Federal Government to the German Government the present German Minister is being recalled and that Herr Adolf Muller, the Editor of the Munchener Bost, has been appointed as his successor. Other objectionable members of the Legation have already been recalled. Among these was Tattenbach, who provided for Lenin&apos;s journey from Switzerland to Russia.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.(N.B. Countries are arranged in alphabetical order under this heading.)General. The text of the invitation to the Lausanne Labour and Socialist Conference was published in Social Demokraten (Stockholm) on January 4th. M. Branting appears to have acted upon a letter dated&apos; December 19th, received from Mr. Henderson, and to have invited neutrals to take part iu the conference. Socialist ^parties of the Central Powers and Russia were officially notified, and German representatives were requested to appear at the conference not later than January 21st (Mr. Clive, January 8th). In view of the strong opposition of French Switzerland, the Swiss Government wishes to prevent the conference being held in Switzerland. Delegates might suffer personal violence from the people (Sir II. Rumbold, January 8th). The names of the Danish delegates, chosen by the Social Democratic party , were communicated by Lord Kilmarnock on January 1.0th.The Secretary of State for the Colonies put forward, on January 9th, a paper (P. 90) on the future of Cyprus, and the Air Ministry a memorandum (P. 93) oil the importance of the island to the British Empire as an aircraft base.The Committee of Enquiry into Breaches of the Laws of War (G.T. G550) have expressed strongly their opinion that the Article or Articles in the Treaty of Peace providing for jurisdiction over enemy offenders should, if possible, be drawn in the7185-3!) c
most comprehensive terms. Subject to reconsideration and modification, the following-heads of charges are suggested : (I) Systematic Terrorism in Belgium, France, and elsewhere. (2) Wanton Devastation, Destruction of Property, and Pillage. (&apos;)) Illegal LeAries. (4) Illegal Executions.(5) Deportation of Civil Population in Occupied Territories and Forced Labour. (6) Murder of Hostages.(7) Indiscriminate Bombardment from the Air.(8) Indiscriminate Bombardment from the Sea.(9) Illegal Methods of Submarine or other Naval Warfare. (TO) Destruction of Hospital Ships. (11) Wilful or Reckless Bombardment of Hospitals. (12) Ill-treatment of Prisoners of War. (13) Directions to give &quot;No Quarter.1&apos; (14) Use of Illegal &quot;Methods of Warfare.&quot;Austria-Hungary. The argument has been advanced by a prominent German-Austrian that if the Peace Conference supports the Czech claim to German Bohemia, there will be no peace for many years on account of German-Austrian Nationalist agitation (Sir H. Rumbold, January 4th). The General Staff on December 28th put forward a comprehensive memorandum with outline map (G.T. 6610) drawn up by the British Section of the Supreme War Council, adumbrating the possible boundaries of a Czecho-Slovak Republic.British Umpire. On January 1st the Ministry of Labour reported that the Labour and Socialist Press generally assumes that the European Allies are at issue with President Wilson about peace terms. The campaign against intervention in Russia is continued (G.T. 6630).   [See also under General.]Mexico. The desirability of participation by Mexico in discussions at the Peace Conference, at, which neutrals may he admitted, appears to be open to strong-objections (Mr. Cummins, Mexico, January 10th).Montenegro. The claims of Montenegro to representation at the Peace Conference were explained by Sir C. Grahame (Paris) on January 9th.Russia. The Omsk Government wishes to be represented when Russian questions are discussed (Foreign Office to Lord Derby, January 13th).Serbia. It is x^proposed that the British, French, and United States Governments shall not recognise the alleged unification of all Serbs, Slovenes and Groats under the Karageorgevitch dynasty, pending a decisiou by the Peace Conference (Foreign Office to Sir 0. des Graz, January 13th). [See also under &quot; Southern Slav States &quot; on page 2.]Turkey. The Turkish Government, having signed the Armistice, must be held responsible for the execution of the terms, especially as affecting Fahri Pasha&apos;s surrender (Foreign Office to Admiral Calthorpe, January 13th).On January Sth the Secretary of State for India put forward a memorandum (P. 91) supplementing Lord Curzon&apos;s paper on the future of Constantinople from the point of view of Indian Mohammedan opinion.
, I if..APPENDIXTOWestern and General Report No. 102.(1) Russia.Owing to the hick of internal communication it is very difficult to obtain news from the interior.An informant recently returned from Petrograd states that the bourgeoisie parties have made complete arrangements for the municipal government of Petrograd in ihe event of the town being occupied by Allied Forces. Arrangements have been made for the electric and water-power stations to be kept going, and the Mayor and Councillors are ready to take office.The population daily expects the landing of Allied troops, and, in the opinion of the informant, it is essential that the Allies should immediately declare their policy, for the alternative raising and damping of the hopes of the population, is gradually driving them to despair. It is thought that British prestige, which still ranks high amongst the Russian educated class, will suffer irreparable damage by what they consider to be a vacillating policy. Even the announcement that no armed interven-tion will take place this year can now do little harm, in that it must now be generally recognised that the season is too late for fighting in the neighbourhood of Petrograd. It is thought certain that if ever Allied troops approach Petrograd, large numbers of the Red Army will desert owing to a considerable proportion of the. Army having joined merely to obtain food. According to a high Russian military officer who is connected with the commissariat department, the Red Army is well armed as regards rifles, and generally well equipped. There is little likelihood of a shortage of rifles owing to a considerable stock of English barrels being available. A large stock of small shells also exists, and up till recently a programme for the construction of artillery was under debate ; the guns manufactured in the works near Petrograd have been a complete failure, owing to defects in the mechanism.Food conditions in Petrograd are deplorable, and things have grown infinitely worse during the last two months. Unrationed food can, however, still be obtained in secret restaurants at fabulous price. The financial situation is even more serious ; there is a great shortage of currency. The informant states that it, was no uncommon sight to see soldiers recognising officers as crossing sweepers, and having collected a crowd, stabbing them to death in the main thoroughfares.The German Soldiers&apos; Council at Moscow has sent a congratulatory telegram to John McLean of Glasgow.It is reported by M. Scavenius, lately Danish Minister in Moscow, that Indians who have been living in Germany have been invited to Moscow to receive money and instructions for Bolshevist propaganda in India. Chinese labourers and Japanese are to be.used in the same way for their respective countries. The Indian Govern-ment has been warned.The reports of The times special, correspondent in Sweden about the growing strength of the Bolshevist regime should be accepted with caution. People were talking in the same strain about the French Revolution and the hopelessness of recovery 120 years ago.(2) Germany.Despite the confusion of the last few days of civil war in Berlin it seems likely that the forces of order will prevail. On November 20th the Soldiers&apos; Council of the Fourth Army issued a manifesto denouncing Bolshevism in unmeasured language, and the Government seems still able to count upon the support of loyal troops.(3) Switzerland.Efforts are being made to induce the Municipality of Lausanne to refuse permission for the National Socialist Congress to be held there.
The propaganda movement emanating from Switzerland is still active, but it may be doubted whether the reports of large transfers of money from Germany for revolutionary purposes in Italy arc correct Signor Nitti made an exhaustive investigation in the various banks, and could not ascertain that any transfers of monev on a large scale were being made from Switzerland to Italy ; at the same time he admitted that the secret police work was being very badly done. He said that the Government had now decided to appoint Signor Vicenzo Quranta, a prefect of Bologna, to organise the Surete Publique. He did not apprehend much internal trouble in Italy.It seems that the Italian Government has now taken serious alarm, and has instructed its diplomatic agents to pay particular attention to Bolshevist activities. Unfortunately they know very little about the subject, and do not appear to have got further than the belief that Scandinavian sailors are being employed by the Bolshevists as agents.The A7atican also is alarmed, and is making overtures to the Quirinal in order that they may join hands in resisting the forces of disorder. An exchange of official archives has already taken place between the Governments, on the initiative of the Vatican.The set-back to the Bolshevists in Switzerland has reacted upon Northern Italy, where the situation is clearly more stable than it was two months ago.(5) Spain.Though the King does not seem to be personally unpopular, and the disturbances in Spain are Separatist rather than Revolutionary, the outlook is certainly disquieting. The upper classes are thoroughly frightened ; there is a continual succession of meaningless strikes in which the q\net men are driven like sheep before a handful of agitators. The King is believed to be weary of office, and the conditions both in Spain and in Portugal are such that a shrewd banker, who has lately returned after surveying the prospects of opening a new banking business in the Iberian Peninsula, states his firm belief that in ten years intervention by the stable Powers of Europe will be necessary to retrieve the country from anarchy. The Seville Conservatives believe that the agitators come from Barcelona, and are French Republicans, but it is far more likely that they are syndicalist, and that such money as is required comes from Socialists in the Argentine.A revolutionary leaflet, inciting&apos;the soldiers to mutiny and to treat women and girls as common property, has been distributed by thousands amongst the Spanish troops. The Authorities were able to confiscate some two thousand of them, which were already in the hands of the men ; some were surrendered voluntarily, others were only obtained by disciplinary action. In the Leon region soldiers were found in possession of other Bolshevist sheets, and one of them apparently had money for which he could not account.   Two sergeants and ten soldiers were put under arrest.B. H. T.January .13 th, 1919.The Swiss are recalling their Minister from Petrograd, although they esthirate that the temporary sacrifice of Swiss interests in Russia may amount to a milliard of francs. The Government thinks that all Bolshevist elements have now been expelled from Lausanne, and they are only waiting the result of the enquiry into the causes of the recent strike, in order to deal with the Bolshevist elements at Berne and Zurich.The Swiss General Stall&apos; are anxious to have the co-operation of the British General Staff in combating Bolshevism in Switzerland.It is reported that some millions of francs have recently been deposited in the name of the wife of the Russian Consul at Geneva in the Banque Internationale de Petrograd.(1) IUxlu.
