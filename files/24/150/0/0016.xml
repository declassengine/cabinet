SECRET.APPRECIATION&quot;   OF  T!IF  ATTACHED   WESTERN   AND  GENERALREPORT No. 110.Ueneral (page 2).&quot; Food, for the time, has taken the place of war material as the decisive factor in inllueiicing the world situation &quot; (Western Report, November 13th, 1918). &quot;As hunger is reported to be the chief incitement for recruiting Bolshevik armies, the control of destination of world food supplies is now a matter of dominating importance&quot; (Western Report, January 15th, 1919). These extracts from former Reports represent the existing situation.Allied Countries.China (page 2). The Allies have made representations to bring about the disbandment of the National Defence Army.Southern Slav States (page 3). A commission has been appointed by the Supreme War Council to enquire into the incidents at Laibach, cSrc, and the Italian Govern-ment will now permit transport of revictualling trains.Since neither the United States nor Great Britain can provide troops for Montenegro, the French Government favours complete evacuation (by Italian and Serbian troops).United States (page 4). --The resolutions of the Irish Convention at Philadelphia (see Report No. 108) have got as far as the President.Enemy Countries.Austria-Hungary (page 4).-Trouble is being engineered in Bohemia by G erman- Austrians.Germany (page 5). All the matter under this heading merits study, but the authorities for each report require attention, especially the fact that it is in German Wireless reports that recent revolts are attributed to Russian agents. German connivance in Bolshevik propaganda work in the British Army is established on better evidence.In seeking for the seat of power, it is useful to bear in mind the report of British officers that the chief administrative posts are still held by ex-Imperial officials.Neutral Countries.Baltic Provinces (page 8). These, in the absence of help from elsewhere, are now between the devil of Bolshevism and the deep sea of German assistance.    [l\t.o.

Reports of Carranza&apos;s attitude are of importance, as affecting British interests.Spain (page 9). His Majesty&apos;s Government is taking a firm stand on the six German ships question ; the acquiescence by the United States in the Spanish view seems to have been somewhat precipitate, in view of tbe question of principle involved.Switzerland (page 9).--The Swiss are nervous about the effect in their country of developments in Bavaria.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Bolshevism. This subject is dealt with under &quot;Germany&quot; and the &quot;Baltic Provinces.&quot;Relaxation of Trade Restrictions. Proposals for the organisation of trade between the United Kingdom and the Left Bank of the Rhine are being discussed (Lord Derby, March 3rd).The Blockade Council has given its approval to measures for controlling trade with Constantinople, the Black Sea and the coast of Asia Minor (Mr. Balfour, March 6th).The following Resolution was adopted by the Superior Blockade Council on March 5th : &quot; That on March 15th notice shall be given by the Associated Governments to their appropriate Representatives in the Northern Neutral Countries and Switzerland, who shall communicate same jointly to the various Governments to which they are accredited, and also to the Import Associations, that there is no objection to articles on the Free List being re-exported to any country.&quot;Attention is drawn to Sir Auckland Geddes&apos;speech in the House of Commons reported in The Times of March 11th stating the Governments policy with regard to the resumption of trade.Economic Relief. A Memorandum (W.C.P. 187) has been prepared by Lord Robert Cecil dealing with the serious economic situation in Europe and the need for immediate relief. The dependence of payment for food supplies upon the import of raw materials is alluded to.Russian Prisoners of War. Lord Kilmarnock reports that Russian prisoners of war in Germany are in urgent need of provisions.Arrangements have been made for the repatriation of Russian prisoners from Holland via Dantzig (Sir W. Townley, March 7th).ALLIED  GROUP.CHINA.Repatriation of Chinese Coolies. Lord Derby reported (March 7th) that the French Government agrees that Chinese workmen in Russia should be given every facility for returning home.Peace Conference at Shanghai. Instructions have been issued to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Paris, Washington and Tokio (Foreign Office telegram, March 6th) to urge the Governments to which they are accredited to take action with the other Allied Governments with the object of bringing about the disbandment of the National Defence Army and the dismissal of the Military Governor responsible for the violation of armistice. (See Report No. 109. page 3.) Sir J. Jordan reported (March 4th) that the Japanese Minister at Peking had been instructed not to take action as proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, as it would be regarded as an attempt to influence the terms awaiting adjustment at Shanghai. However, on March 7th, according to Sir J. Jordan, four Ministers conveyed, the views of their Governments to the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs, who said he would submit them to the President and Prime Minister. The Japanese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs is disposed to adhere to view that the action suggested would amount to an attempt to influence the terms awaiting adjustment at Shanghai ; he is, however, considering what reply to give to the Japanese Minister at Peking in regard to the question of a collective representation to the Chinese President (Sir C. Greene, March 9th).Commercial Flying. Sir J. Jordan (March 5th) forwarded particulars regarding the possibility of holding flying exhibitions in China with a view to using aeroplanes for commercial purposes.
CUBA.Labour Unrest. Mr. Cowan reported (March 5th) that another general strike had been declared in Havana, in sympathy with workers locked out by builders. He had asked the Captain of JJ.M.S. Dauntless to delay the departure of the ship and see how tho situation developed. On March 10th the situation was reported to be worse than at any previous time and H.M.S. Dauntless had received orders from the Admiralty to remain until further instructed. Two small American cruisers and ten submarine chasers had also arrived.FRANCE.Franco-German Frontier. This question continues to be debated in the French Press, and on March 5th and 9th Ford Derby drew attention to articles on the subject in Petit Parisien and Gaulois by Lieutenant-Colonel liousset, who insists that the Rhine is the only possible military frontier which cannot be turned or forced  between France and Germany. Lord Derby also quoted from an article in Humanite by M. Marcel Cachin, who is indignant at the action of M. Louis Barthou in heading deputation to M. Clemenceau to ask for his support at Peace Conference to policy of annexation of left bank of Rhine (March 9th).Relations -with Great Britain and United Stales. M. Gauvaiu, in Journal des Debuts of March 8th, declared that it is of vital interest to France to maintain closest union with Great Britain and the United States, and advocates that the covenant of the League of Nations must be adhered to at all costs as that is the only possible form of such an alliance (Lord Derby, March 8th).Payment for Supplies imported into Germany. Lord Derby called attention (March 9th) to criticism in Echo de Paris regarding payment for American wheat and cotton imported into Germany, which it is held should not be made out of German funds until the legitimate and prior rights of French and Belgian inhabitants of occupied districts have been satisfied. In a somewhat aggressive article towards America, the writer insists that the League of Nations should be the only purchaser and seller vis-d-vis Germany.JAPAN.Rising in Korea. Sir C. Greene, in referring to a Korean rising which took place at the funeral of Grand Prince Yi at Seoul, states (March 9th) that the Japanese Government feels no uneasiness regarding it. The rising was instigated by young malcontents who declared that the independence of Korea had been approved at the Paris Peace Conference. The ringleader was arrested and a report from the Governor-General stated that the riotous state of the population would not continue.SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Serbia and Jugo-Slavia. A despatch has been circulated from Sir C. des Graz (31097), dated February 15th, commenting on the political situation from the point of view of the relations of the Serbians of the Kingdom of Serbia with the different parties in &quot; Jugo-Slavia,&quot; of whom most are represented in the present Government of the Kingdom of the Serbians, Oroatiaus and Slovenes.Serbia. The Serbian Government have asked His Majesty&apos;s Government to support their request for the immediate return of 400,000 cattle seized by the enemy during occupation of Serbia, as it will be impossible to carry on the year&apos;s harvest without them. The suggestion is made that the value of the cattle be deducted from the war indemnity (Sir C. des Graz, March 4th).Saloch-Laibach Incidents. The Supreme War Council has appointed a Commission to inquire into incidents of February 12th and 20th at Saloch andLaibach (see .1.0.150, S.W.C. 385). On appointment of Commission the Italian Government will permit transport via Laibach of trains necessary for revictuailing purposes (Astoria, March 7th and 9th).Montenegro. In view of refusal of United States Government to despatch troops to Montenegro, and inability of His Majesty&apos;s Government to replace American battalion on point of being withdrawn from Cattaro, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Lord Derby (March 9th) that, in the opinion of his Government, the best solution now would be complete evacuation of Montenegro. In fact, orders have already been issued for the withdrawal of French troops, thus only Italian and
Serbian contingents will remain there. M. Pichon inquires whether, under the circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not consider it preferable to carry out complete evacuation. The Foreign Office has instructed Lord Derby (March 11th) to request the French Government to postpone the&quot; withdrawal of French troops pending consideration of the whole Montenegrin situation on President Wilson&apos;s return to Paris.UNITED &apos; STATES.Loans to Italy. Lord Heading reported (March Gth) that the United States Treasury has informed Italy that it is not prepared to continue to make advances until it has ascertained the conditions of credits established by the British Government.Reconstruction and Labour Questions. A conference of State Governors and Mayors of large cities, convened by President Wilson to discuss these questions, sat in Washington from March 3rd to March 5th. The following resolutions were adopted : Government should help industry hy carrying out programme of railway improvements ; Government approval of price schedules but without fixed prices would he useful in establishing a new basis of values ; reduction of freight rates on building aud road material; wages should only be reduced with cost of living; Government should help in avoiding financial difficulties in public utilities. Pestric-tions on industries and materials should be removed as soon as possible (Lord Beading, March Oth).Irish Peace Convention at Philadelphia. Lord Reading reported (March 5th) that President Wilson met the Convention^ delegates, but first of all insisted on the withdrawal of Justice Cohalan, of New York, who was compromised in the Von Igel correspondence. After resolutions of the Convention had been submitted to the President, he was asked to present to the Peace Conference the question of the right of Ireland to determine its form of Government; but the President said that as he was a Government representative he felt he should not be expected to make a formal reply.The House of Representatives has agreed (March 4th) by 216 votes 41, to resolution expressing earnest hope that Peace Conference would favourably consider claims of Ireland. As a unanimous vote for bringing forward a similar motion in the Senate could not be obtained, there was no time for its consideration in that Chamber.Opinion towards Great Britain. A Memorandum (G.T. 6900), issued by the Political Intelligence Department, outlines the trend of American opinion towards Great Britain from the date of the signing of the armistice with Germany to the return of President Wilson from Paris.ENEMY &amp;R0UP.AUST RIA-HUN GA RY.Czecho-Slovakia. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Pi-ague reports that according to documents seized by the Czecho-Slovak Government it is the intention of the German-Austrian Government to iuvade Bohemia.Consequent upon demonstrations hy strikers in German Bohemia encounters have taken place between the populace and Czech troops at Karlsbad and Eger (Mr. Gosling, March 5th). Sir PI. Rumbold has received a telegram from the Town Council of Eger complaining of acts of violence perpetrated- lry the Czechs and requesting the protection of American or British troops.The following announcement appears in the German Wireless Report of March 6th :-&quot;Throughout German Bohemia demonstrations in favour of the right of self-determination of the nation and in favour of joining German-Austria took place on March 4th and on the day of the opening of the German-Austrian National Assembly &quot;According to a German Wireless, report of the same date a Secret Decree has been issued by the Governor of Prague demanding that German Bohemian representa-tives shall be watched as traitors and shall be refused passes to proceed into German-Austria.
Food Supplies. A proposal is being brought before the Supreme Economic )        Council that the navigation on the Elbe and the Rhine should be reopened for the purpose of revictualling Czecho-Slovakia subject to certain safeguards (Mr. Balfour, &apos; March Oth).Goal Supply. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Prague lias been instructed to support Austrian representations against the stoppage of coal from Upper Silesia by the Czecho-Slovak Government.The Ex-Emperor. The British Military representative at Vienna reports that the Austrian Government is introducing a law for the abdication and banishment of the Emperor. The latter refuses to go to Germany or Italy. His Majesty&apos;s Government has promised to afford every facility for his journey to Switzerland with the proviso that his continued residence there must be settled by the Peace Conference.GERMAN!:&apos;.Political Situation. (1) General. The Cardinal Secretary of State (Vatican) has addressed the following Note to Count de Salis : &quot; From direct and trustworthy information the Holy See has become aware that the political and economic situation in Germany is very grave. Unless a peace which Germans can accept, and which is not humiliating for them, is shortly reached, Germany will become Bolshevik and the ally and imitator of Russia. In view of the supreme interests of civilisation and of European peace the Holy See considers it its duty to hasten to give warning to Great Britain, and through her to the other Powers of the Entente, urging the conclusion of a speedy and suitable peace.&quot;(2) Berlin. After two clays&apos; fighting, which was most severe in the Alexander Platz . and before the Police Presidium, the Government appears to have gained control of all important buildings and points d&apos;appui by March 7th except in the suburbs, where local lighting continues, especially in Fast Berlin and Lichtenburg. A thousand casualties are reported to have been incurred. As a result of the excesses committed by Spartacist bands, lierr Noske has proclaimed martial law. Any person who is found fighting against Government troops with a weapon in his hand is to be shot immediately. On March 11th normal conditions prevailed throughout the greater part of Berlin, and the general strike terminated in a considerable resumption of work. The People&apos;s Naval Division, which sided with the Spartaeists, has been disarmed. The Governments Socialisation Bill (see below) and riroposals for the inclusion of the WorkiueiFs and Soldiers&apos; Councils in the constitution appears to have favourably affected working-class opinion in Berlin. The Government asserts that the revolt was not clue to the workmen, the majority of whom were against the general strike, but to the political demands (vide Report No. 109, page G) of the Spartacists, who were determined to make a trial of strength. An examination of the papers captured on Berlin communists proves the participation of Russian agents in the revolt by the method of inciting and supporting the German revolutionaries (German Wireless reports, March Oth to 12th inclusive).According to latest reports a Spartacist] deputation has approached Herr Noske with a view to obtaining peace terms. The Minister for Defence is said to have insisted on unconditional surrender.(3) North Sea Ports. A normal situation prevails at Hamburg and Linden. At Bremen a demand, supported by a strike, is being made for the release of political prisoners (German Wireless, March Gth).(4) Upper Silesia. The situation in the coal districts is tense, but external order is being maintained by military forces. In agreement with the People&apos;s Council of Breslau and the Central Council of the Province, the General Commanding the Gth Army Corps has proclaimed martial law (German Wireless, March 9th).Eightv-five per cent, of Upper Silesian production is reported to be at a stancl-.still (March 1.2th).(5) Westphalia, and the Rhine Province. Tlie situation has improved, though, on March 8th the number of strikers in the Ruhr district was reported to have increased to 12,GOO. Latest reports (March 12th) state that at Muhlheini the workers of the Friedrich-Wilhelm Foundries have blown up the blast furnaces on account of a difference over wages.(6; Leipzig. It was decided to resume work on March 10th (German Wireless March 1.0th).7570-2!) b
(7) Magdeburg. Violent Spartacist agitation has commenced (March Cth).(8) Brunswick. Herr Eichhorn, the former President of the Berlin Police, has resumed his political activity in Brunswick, which is considered a refuge for scattered communistic partisans (German Wireless, March 11th).Economic aspect of the political situation. A Report (G.T. 0936) has been circulated by the Secretary of State for War giving the information obtained by two officers during a visit to Germany between February 13th to 15th. After inspecting locomotive workshops at Cassel, Captain Bell came to the conclusion that Germany&apos; is at her wits&apos; end in the matter of rolling stock and raw materials for repairs. He states that hunger is at the bottom of a good deal of the unrest. Captain Roddie states that Leipzig is economically in a worse plight than Berlin ; carrots, turnips, dried beans, cabbage and beet have formed the staple food for months past. Six hundred head of cattle are killed per week to provide for 450,000 inhabitants. Boots and woollen goods are no longer obtainable. Captain Roddie alludes to the harmful policy of continuing starvation. &quot; Germany is on the brink of a volcano.&quot; It is the popular belief that as soon as food comes into the country the change from Monarchism to Republicanism will prove to be for the better. The feeling against the French is bitter, and it is believed that if it rested with Germany and the United Slates Germany would be given better treatment.Food Belief. Attention is drawn to a Note (G.T. 6947) on Food Supplies for the Left Bank of the Rhine, by Mr. E. F. Wise (Ministry of Food). The] Berlin food authorities have notified the occupied areas that no allocation of grain or potatoes can be expected from the rest of Germany after the middle of March. The supply of fats and meats has already ceased. Mr. Wise emphasises the importance of the occupied territories being well fed as compared with the rest of Germany, and claims that the shipping deadlock should not affect food, relief in districts where the Allies are direct^&apos; responsible. Sir Herbert Plumer is reported by The Times&apos; political correspondent at Paris (Times, March 1.1th) to have urged the necessity of relief measures for Western Germany.Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Councils. It is stated in the Report (G.T. 6936) referred to above that though the Councils are represented in every department they are not all-powerful, and the chief administrative posts are still held by ex-Imperial officials.Independent Socialist Programme. The Tageszeitung of March 4th reports that Herr Haase, speaking in the Convention of the Independent Socialistic Party at Berlin, formulated the demands of the Party as follows: (1) Complete disbandment of the old Army and of the Volunteer Corps, with the organisation of a People&apos;s Army composed of men over 24 who have been at least one year in political or labour organisations. Election of officers by the men and organisation of Soldiers&apos; Councils. (2) Extension of the system of Workmen&apos;s Councils and their recognition by the Constitution as administrative and legislative bodies. (3) Immediate socialisation of capitalistic enterprises, including large estates and forests. (4) A municipal monopoly of advertisements. (5) Requisition of unused dwelling facilities. (6) Confiscation of all war fortunes and heavy taxes on all large fortunes. (7) Separation of Church and State, and Church and School. (8) Election of judges and administra-tive authorities by the people. (9) Immediate resumption of diplomatic relations with the Russian Soviet Republic and Poland.Labour Situation in Berlin. The following statement on labour difficulties in Berlin originates from a person occupying an authoritative position in the metal industry of that city :-Roughly speaking, the number of unemployed in Berlin early in February was 300,000, and of these 40,000 belonged to the metal industry. The number is increasing daily owing to the lack of raw material.and coal. An average unemployment wage of Mies. 10 per clay, including Sundays, is being paid, so that for the metal industry alone a weekly sum of Mks. 2,800,000 is being absorbed in this manner.An attempt to relieve matters was made by means of a law, passed on January 4th, 1919, decreeing that every man returning from the front must be employed for at least two weeks by his former employers. In addition, no worker may be dismissed if any factory hand is working more than five hours a day. The result of the latter provision is that practically all works are running on a five-hour day basis only.It hardly seems possible to anticipate any improvement until a fresh, supply of raw material arrives..and a big reduction in food prices takes place (War Office Summaiy of Information, March Sth).
Socialisation. The following announcement appears in the German Wireless report of March Gth : &quot; The Imperial Government has issued the following proclamation :  &apos; Socialisation has been established. The Coal Syndicate is to be socialised at once. &apos; By this means the Government, that is to say the whole people, obtain absolute &apos; control of the whole coal industry. Steps are being taken also for the socialisation &apos; of potash mining at the earliest possible moment. The Bill for general socialisation &apos; which has been laid before the National Assembly provides for replacing the &apos; former unrestricted private management by the German Government management. &apos; The Government, that is to say all of us. will regulate the management. This is &apos; Socialism. The Government will take care that, as demanded by the common &apos; interest, the management shall not be carried on anywhere in capitalistic private &apos; interests.&apos; &quot;Prospects of the, Chemical Industry in England and Germany. The following extract is taken from an official report on the factories belonging to the German combine of dye and druQ- makers (War Office Summary of Information, March 11th) :-&apos;&apos; Thus, at the time of the armistice, Germany is left with a chemical industry which has a greater productive capacity than it had before the war. But in spite of this there is no reason why she should regain her former position in the worlds chemical market, provided that measures are taken to assist the chemical industry in Allied countries during the period of reconstruction. The general impression gained in recent observation is that the technical practice in the German factories is not markedly superior to that obtaining in England at the end of the Avar, and in some respects it is inferior. The main source of the strength of the German chemical industry appears to lie in the organisation and in the large scale of its production, which have been made possible by the ample financial support it has received.&quot; By means of those advantages Germany has been able to cheapen production and establish a strong economic position, and to secure the developments of the industry by the large sums devoted to technical research. However, the rapid growth of British chemical industry during the war proves that it can compete successfully with Germany, provided that reconstruction is undertaken on a sufficiently large scale.&quot;Bolshevik Propaganda. Sir H. Rumbold learns that Herr Henke, an independent Socialist, is planning to carry on active propaganda in the British Army through the agency of soldiers from the Rhine district. He is stated to be in receipt of large sums of money from Russia.Poland. According to a German Wireless report dated March Gth, many meetings have been held recently by German and Polish speaking men and women in the communes and towns of Upper Silesia, and resolutions have been passed in which fiery protests are made against the incorporation of Upper Silesia in the Polish State which is being striven for by the Poles, and the demand is made that Upper Silesia, which has developed in the closest historical, economic and cultural relations with the German home country, shall remain a part of Germany.NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.The Port Strike. In view of the disastrous effect of the deadlock at the port of Buenos Ayres tbe commercial representatives of the British and United States Governments have submitted a scheme to the shipping companies for the settlement of the dispute. The United States Ambassador is stated to be averse to making joint diplomatic representations to the President (Sir R. Tower, March Gth).On March 8th Sir R. Tower reported that the shipping companies had agreed to resume work on condition that the dock labourers should Avaive their right to boycott and to interfere with the free employment of labour pending the passage of a law through Congress establishing the clelinite rights and duties of men employed in the clocks and on board ships.
sIn view of the heavy share of losses borne by British shipping owing to the lock-out, Sir R. Tower has been authorised to make separate representations to President Irigoyen (Foreign Office, March 7th).BALTIC PROVINCES.Military Situation. The following news is derived from Russian Wireless reports :  (1) Estlionia.-Bolshevik forces occupied villages at the mouth of the Narova, but were forced to retire by a counter-attack.&apos; (2) Livonia. The Bolsheviks have advanced north-west and north-east of Marieuburg. Midway between Marienburg and Pskov they are astride the high road in the region of Korvenhof and Mentsen, where fighting continues.(3) Courland. Red Lettish forces were repulsed at Muravevo (east of Libau), and fell back to Popeliany (20 miles south-east of Muravevo).Lord Kilmarnock learns that on March 3rd Lettish troops crossed the Windau south of Goldingen, and advanced along the Libau-Mitau railway. German contingents are moving in the direction of Talsen (north-east of Goldingen).Gorman Operations. Lord Kilmarnock has been informed by the naval autho-rities that German ships are not to be permitted to transport supplies or reinforcements to the army operating in Courland. He points out that, unless aided by a German army, the Letts are not strong enough to continue successful operations against the Bolsheviks.DENMARK.The Government. Lord Kilmarnock reports that the King has made the following-declaration to the Party leaders : &quot; As a result of my deliberations I declare that I will not nominate a Ministry which is not in agreement with the majority of the Folkthing. I regret that there is no -prospect of forming a Coalition Ministry. I beg the Party leaders to consider how the political situation can best be arranged, and I am confident that you, gentlemen, in your deliberations will keep in &quot;mind the true welfare of the country and of the people in these serious times. I shall be glad to receive proposals as to what agreement can be reached between the parties.&quot;The Sehleswig Question. -Lord Kilmarnock reports that the future of Middle Schleswig is still the subject of much discussion. It is stated on good authority that the desire among the inhabitants of Middle Schleswig for union with Denmark is general, but that under existing conditions they would not dare to vote for union. A. suggestion is made for the occupation of the whole of Schleswig as far south as the Eider by Allied troops and for the removal of German officials and garrisons. If this action is taken and time is given for pro-Danish feeling to develop a considerable majority is expected to vote in favour of the union of the whole of Schleswig north of the Dannevirk line with Denmark.FINLAND.German Influence. According to a Foreign Office telegram there is reason to believe that the eradication of German influence and the removal of German officers is not being undertaken by the Finnish Government with sufficient energy. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Helsingfors has therefore been instructed to warn General Mannerheim that the supply of foodstuffs to Finland will be made dependent upon the necessary action being taken.MEXICO.carranza&apos;s Policy. -Sehor Miguel Covarrubias, a man of high reputation and conservative character, has informed His Majesty&apos;s representative at Mexico that he retracts his previous recommendation for Great Britain&apos;s recognition of Carranza&apos;s Government. He states that Carranza is convinced that President Wilson will not employ military intervention in Mexico. Carranza and his followers have made large fortunes.   The Government is hostile to foreigners and&apos; has no real intention of
surrendering British properties (vide Report No. 107, page 8). Senor Govarrubias believes that 80 per cent, of the population would welcome Allied intervention and the consequent re-establishnient of justice.Arms. Lord Reading has been informed that the State Department at Washington has permitted the shipment of two million cartridges and two thousand rifles consigned to the Mexican Government. These, it is stated, are to be used for the protection of life and property in the districts surrounding Chihuahua and Tainpico. The United States Government is satisfied that no shipments of war material are being made from.Japan or elsewhere.Lord Reading has been instructed to represent to the United States Government the danger, iu the case of Chihuahua, of these arms falling into the hands of Villa, arid, in the case of Tainpico, of their being used by Carranza in an attack upon Pelaez. The latter event might lead to the destruction or confiscation of the oil wells.SPAIN.German Sldps. The transfer of the six German ships to Spain has not yet reached a settlement. His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that a question of principle is involved. The German Government is endeavouring to evade its obligation under the terms of the Treves Agreement to hand over all German tonnage to the Allies Avhile other neutrals may follow Spaiu&apos;s example in claiming German ships. Great importance is attached xo the flying of the Inter-Allied flag (vide Report No. 109, page 10), as signifying the temporary nature of the transfer (Foreign Office, March 7th).Mr. Barclay has been instructed to point out to the Government of the United States the undesirability of acknowledging the Spanish or other neutral claims to German tonnage without the concurrence of the Associated Governments.Situation at Barcelona. A report has been received from His Majesty&apos;s repre-sentative at Barcelona stating that the strike is entirely syndicalist and is directed against the Government rather than against companies. Count Romanones, who is stated to be in fear of assassination, refuses to declare a state of siege or even to discover the syndicalist leaders.SWEDEN.Aland Islands. The Finnish Minister at Stockholm has received information to -the effect that the King of Sweden with Messrs. Eden, Bostrom, Hivjer, and the Swedish Minister at Helsingfors have decided to acquire the Aland Islands at any cost and regardless of the means it may be found necessarv to employ (Mr. Bell, March 11th).SWITZERLAND.The German Menace. Sir H. Rumbold learns that Dr. Muhlon has been informed by the Federal Council of the danger in which Switzerland is placed by the state of anarchy obtaining in Bavaria. The Council suggested that the Swiss Government should obtain permission from the Allies to send relief to Bavaria. Dr. Muhlon objected on the ground that Switzerland would be powerless to make economic assistance dependent upon political stability. The Swiss Minister at Paris has pointed out to the French Government the danger to Switzerland caused by the present situation in Germany.Poland. Swiss recognition of the Polish Government is proposed (Sir H. Rumbold, March Sth).
