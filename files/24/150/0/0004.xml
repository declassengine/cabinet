British tonnage has been asked for for repatriation of American troops.Enemy Countries.Austria-Hungary (page 7). The internal situation in both of the late kingdoms remains in a confused state.Germany (page 8). On the surface it would appear that power will lie with whoever controls the still-mobilised field army, but prospects of obtaining food and raw material seem now to be exercising an increasing influence, as compared with armaments, upon the internal situation. The meeting of the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils in Berlin on December Kith may clear up the situation. In the meantime, the policy of those in power is clearly indicated.   An attempt is being made to stir
up internal strife in enemy countries, with a view to weakening their power of imposing just conditions of peace.

WESTERN AND G-ENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Repatriation of Prisoners. (1) Germany. It is stated in a message transmitted through the wireless stations of the German Government that the Entente Commission appointed for the purpose of takiug over prisoners of war did not arrive at Aix-la-Chapelle at the correct time. In consequence of this it is asserted that the German guards were unable any longer to restrain the prisoners, who, on their own initiative, found their way to the Entente lines. This is made an excuse for the wretched condition of the prisoners.Lord Kilmarnock learns that the situation at Heilsberg Camp (East Prussia) is serious. A small party of Danish doctors and nurses is being sent there. Lord Kilmarnock urges the importance of sending Red Cross representatives to outlying camps. Prisoners are also in considerable danger owing to the increasing anarchy at Eutin Camp (Oldenburg). At Langensalza (Saxony), according to Press reports, a disturbance has taken place resulting in nine deaths and 15 injuries. Sir W. Townley has been requested to obtain reports in those camps where conditions are unsatisfactory.Sir W. Townley reports that the Dutch authorities have given much assistance in making arrangements for the evacuation of prisoners at Munster and are negotiating with the German authorities to run a daily service from Osnabruck to Holland.Sir W. Townley learns from a German source that the transport of prisoners from the camps at Minded and Senne has been hindered by the Belgians blocking the Rhine at Dusseldorf.Information was received on December 6th from Berlin that the employment of British prisoners in coal mines has ceased.General Ewart has been appointed to act as senior Red Cross representative in Berlin. The following distribution of work among the British Red Cross repre-sentatives, who are to be under the Netherlands Minister at Berlin, is proposed. General Ewart will rank as the senior representative with general powers of strper-vision. He will be especially responsible for repatriation through Switzerland. Mr. Abrahamson and Mr. Mayne will be responsible for the camps East of the Elbe, and for transportation via the Baltic Ports and Denmark. A third representative is to be appointed to deal with repatriation via the Rhine and Holland.A German Wireless report of December 8th announces the arrival of General Dupont in Berlin to make arrangements for the repatriation of Trench prisoners.The British representatives have been requested to render assistance to American prisoners who are being repatriated.The Inter-departmental Committee on Prisoners of War stated on December 5th that 1,861 officers, 48,965 other ranks and 2,720 civilians had arrived at Hull, Leith, and Dover.(2) Holland. Sir W. Townley reported that 4,000 prisoners could be received daily in Holland provided there Avas sufficient tonnage for their immediate transport.(3) Sweden. Mr. Clive reports that the Swedish Government has permitted the use of the military barracks near Helsingborg for the accommodation of 2,200 prisoners at a time. This should relieve the situation in Denmark, where prisoners are arriving from Baltic ports quicker than they can be sent on.(4) Russian Prisoners. Mr. Frick, a delegate to the International Committee of the Red Cross at Geneva, has submitted, to Lord Derby a scheme for the organisation and relief of Russian prisoners in enemy countries. The main points of the scheme are (1) that the International Committee should undertake the task, (2) that the work of collection and distribution should take place on lines running from Revai via Vilua and Minsk to Kieff and southward, (3) that food supplies should be provided from the Ukraine.   The French Government is giving its close attention to this
scheme, which is considered important on political as well as humanitarian grounds. His Majesty&apos;s Government has been asked to give its views.The German Ministry of War states that the Russian prisoners at Dantzig are so angry at the delay in their repatriation that they are preventing the departure of ships containing Allied prisoners. Lord Kilmarnock learns that they feel intense hatred towards Great Britain owing to the refusal to allow supplies to be released for them.ALLIED  GROUP.BRAZIL.Financial Transactions with the United States. Sir A. Peel reports that a statement appears in a newspaper well informed in financial matters to the effect that an arrangement is being made between the Governments of Brazil and the United States by which the latter is to pay off the whole of the Brazilian external debt to England and France. At the same time United States capitalists are to furnish a loan for the construction of railways in different parts of Brazil. Guarantees are to be assured by the Brazilian Customs revenue, while various railway systems and the Brazilian Lloyd Shipping Company are to be placed under American management. Sir A. Peel confronted the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is reported to have negotiated the business, Avith this statement. The Minister declared it to be untrue, and added that such a scheme would be opposed by public opinion in Brazil.CHINA.North and South. Sir J. Jordan reported on December 4th that the Allied action on behalf of an united China has produced a very favourable impression throughout the country. At a Conference of the Cabinet Ministers and the Northern Military Governors it was decided to meet the Southern representatives at a Peace Conference to be held in Shanghai.Sir J. Jordan learns that the Government of the United States has suggested to the Japanese Government the advantage of promising financial assistance to an united Chinese Government. The Allied Ministers concur in the suggestion. The Government of the United States is also of the opinion that no arms or ammunition should be sent to either side until their differences are settled.Enemy Interests. Considerable progress is being made with the work of restricting the activities of enemy residents and business concerns. (1) The German Batik at Shanghai is in process of liquidation. (2) Permits to employ German capital or engineers in mining enterprises are being revoked. (3) Orders have been issued for the closure of the German soap factory at Shanghai. (4) The Chinese Government is prepared to reduce the number.of enemy teachers at the German College at Wustmg. (5) The internment of enemy civilians is proceeding slowly.Meanwhile the opinion is growing among Allied communities that the only solution to the problem of enemy activities lies in the repatriation of all enemy residents.FRANCE.National Unity. Sir G. Grahame (Paris) reports that on December 2nd a great patriotic meeting was held at Champigny on the anniversary of the battle of 1870. The President of the Republic and M. Albert Thomas delivered speeches, in the course of which M. Thomas said: &quot; The people have now possessed themselves of power and are torn between their national aspirations and their class claims . . . . Which will gain the upper hand ? Dictatorship of poverty in revolution or disciplined democracy ensuring to citizens the enjoyment of new rights. Let us affirm and prove by our actions that in France this question is solved. Let national union, cemented by victory,&apos;bc not only the formula which buoyed up our courage, but let it become the guiding principle of a pacific and well-ordered democracy.&quot;
Lahour. The &quot;Temps contains a strong article protesting against the demand made by certain Socialists that the working class should be represented at the Peace Conference (vide Report No. 96), or that an International Labour Conference should be held concurrently with the Peace Conference. The working class, it declares, has no more right to such representation than any other class. There are 22,000,000 of rural as opposed to 17,000,000 of urban population ; there are 39,000,000.inhabitants of France proper and 54,000,000 colonials. Why, it asks, should any one class be represented in preference to another ? It is for the regular Government to represent the rights and interests of all citizens.Responsibility for the War. M. Gauvain, in an article in Debate, criticises Herr solf&apos;s suggestion for a neutral commission to enquire into the question of responsi-bility for the war. All nations qualified to judge have taken part in the war, and those countries which have suffered for four years will not allow interference in their affairs by nations which have been sheltered by what in many cases has proved a profitable neutrality. Neutrals are similarly disqualified from taking part in the Peace Conference.Relations with Belgium. Lord Derby reports that the Xing and Queen of the Belgians were enthusiastically received in Paris on December 5th. M. Poincarein his speech at the Elysee declared that Belgium, freed from the trammels of her neutrality, which was no guarantee for her, would recover her independence and sovereignty. The occasion has been used by the French Press for a number of articles dealing with Franco-Belgian relations. The following points are made : (1) a military, economic, and political alliance between France, Belgium and England; (2) French to the exclusion of German trade with Antwerp ; (3) the union of Belgium and Luxemburg.Relations with Italy. The leading article in the Temps of December 8th denounces statements which have appeared in the Gorriere d&apos; Italia to the effect that italy is directly interested in the question of the Rhine and demands that the fate of that river should be decided apart from any Imperialist policy. According to the Temps, the Corrlere d&apos; Italia goes on to saj^that if France possessed the Rhine it would be the same as if Italy possessed the Danube. After pointing out the strategic advantages of French possession of the Rhine not only for France but also for Italy, the Temps declares that the article in the Italian paper was obviously inspired by the Papal Secretariat of State, which has always believed in German victory and Austrian&apos; solidity. The Temps concludes with a violent denunciation of Papal diplomatic aud political manoeuvres, which will not, it declares, embitter the good relations existing between France and Italy.President Wilson. Socialist papers contain a number of laudatory articles on the arrival of President Wilson in France. To quote from one of them, the Socialist Deputy, Marcel Cachin, in Humanlte, declares that it is the wish of the whole population of Paris that the day of President Wilson&apos;s arrival should be an apotheosis. &quot; That day must be the triumph of ideas of a just, democratic, and lasting peace, as opposed to all the jingo Imperialist tendencies expressed by our abject reaction.&quot;The Parliamentary Socialist group is sending. Delegates to Brest to greet the President. Among them will be M. Albert Thomas, M.- Longuet and the extremist M. Raffin-Dugena. Another delegation of the Socialist group is charged with arranging with the Confederation clu Travail details for a great demonstration.Tin Sarre Coal Mines. M. Leon Perrier, the President of the Parliamentary Mining Commission, in the course of a debate in the Chamber, declared that the deficiency in French coal mines could be made up by those of the Sarfe which produced 11,000,000 tons. He disclaimed all wish to advocate the annexation of the valley of the Sarre, but considered that the mines could be transferred from the Prussian to the French State. M. Margaine, a Radical Socialist Deputy, stated that it would be impossible to work the mines without annexing the valley of the Sarre.ITALY.Occupation of the Trentino. It is announced through the wireless stations of the Italian Government that educational life in the Trentino is assuming its normal course.   Elementary schools have been reopened.   The Grammar School of Trent
has recommenced its classes, and the Royal College, which was kept closed by the Austrians during the war, is to be opened on December 12th. Patriotic demonstrations hail the resurrection of chdl life in the districts which have been reunited with Italy.Occupation of Zara.-The Foreign Office has received a memorandum from the Italian Ambassador to the effect that Serbian troops have been ordered to proceed from Cattaro to Zara. The landing of Italian troops at the latter town is therefore being-expedited. The Italian Government requests that the Serbian Government be urged not to send troops to any part of the Dalmatian coast which is affected by the terms of the Treaty of London. Lord Derby, who has been instructed to find out the views of the French Government, has been informed that in the opinion of the British Government the Serbians should not occupy Zara, but that the Italian Government should be given to understand that the Serbians are being antoganised by the Italian occupation of Fiume in which the Serbians are not being allowed to particij3ate.It may be noted that the predominant race in Zara is Italian.Fiume. Mr. Balfour has received a telegram dated December 7th from the President of the National Council of Fiume, declaring that the free town, port, and district of Fiume, acting on the strength of its indisputable right and the principle of self-determination, on October 30th declared Hungarian authority abolished, and reconstituted itself an independent political body with full sovereign powers. The duties of administration have, by the will of the people, been assumed by the Italian National Council, and confidence is expressed that the ttnion of Fiume with Italy, the desire for which has been demonstrated by a popular referendum, will be recognised by the Peace Conference.Jugo-Slavia. Sir R. Rodd states that he has been reminded by the Italian GoArernment that the Allies decided at the meetings Avhich took place at Paris in November not to recognise the Southern Slav Government until the terms of the armistice had been carried out. The Italian Government considers it impossible to recognise the existence of a Southern Slav State until the existing differences between the Southern Slavs of Austria and those of Serbia have been composed..    JAPAN.Financial Transaction with China. Sir C. Greene forwarded on December 6th a statement issued by the Japanese Foreign Office complaining of the mischievous reports which were being circulated with regard to Japanese loans to China. It asserts that the Japanese Government, fully realising that loans are liable to create misunderstanding among the contending factions in China and interfere with the re-establishment of peace and unity, have decided to withhold such financial assistance to China. The Government hopes that all the interested Powers will participate in this policy. On the other hand, the Japanese Government is unwilling to place an embargo in the financial and economic enterprise of its subjects in China. It has, therefore, decided that Jaj)anese capitalists intending to negotiate with Central or Local Governments in China loans which might be utilised for political expenditure must first report to the Japanese Foreign Office, Legation, or Consulate and from time to time notify them of the progress of such negotiations.The Labour Problem.-Mr. Balfour has received a Memorandum from His Majesty&apos;s representative at Tokyo dealing with the serious labour situation which has arised in Japan. There is an increasing under-current of dissatisfaction among Labour with the existing state of affairs, of which the recent rice riots are symptomatic. Capitalists are making enormous profits, and mushroom millionaires, Avhose wealth carries A\rith it no responsibilities, groAv rich overnight. At the same time the Avorkers, although a certain advance has been made in Avages, feel that theyT have not received a corresponding share in the profits.The unrest among the Avorking classes is only likely to be aggravated after the Avar, AArhich will probably be followed by a great slump in Japan, and a consequent closing doAvn of factories. The danger will then become serious, especially/ in the ship-building and mining industries, Avhere a rough element of the population is7U01-2b B
Gemployed. The police&apos;s loss of authority and the lack of the old-fashioned respect shown by the worker for his manager may be taken among the signs of the times.On the other hand, the agricultural labourers, who form the bulk of the people, have not been infected with the Bolshevist bacillus. The authorities are beginning to interest themselves in the labour situation. Baron Shibusama, who may be called the father of the business world in Japan and is much respected both by workmen and employers, has decided to try and reform the existing labour conditions. A new and genuine factory law and the amelioration of the workman&apos;s condition may solve a serious problem, but it will affect one of Japan&apos;s greatest assets, from an industrial point of view, which has been her cheap and docile labour.-    . PORTUGAL.Attempted Assassination of the President. Sir L. Carnegie reports that on the afternoon of December 6th an attempt was made upon the life of the President of the Republic when on his way to a parade by a man who fired two shots from a revolver. His Majesty&apos;s Government has congratulated the President on his escape.. SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Moiitenegro.-Sir G. Graham (Paris) states that the Montenegrin Government has issued a communique refuting the reports which have come through Switzerland to the effect that the Montenegrin National Assembly which met at Podgoritza on December 1st, voted the deposition of King Nicolas. The latter has informed a French journalist that he is sure of the loyalty of his subjects. It is pointed out that Podgoritza is occupied by Serbian troops.Sir R. Rodd has been informed that on December 6th, 18 Montenegrin delegates left Skuptchina for Belgrade to proclaim the annexation of Montenegro to Serbia.The Future of Jugo-Slavia. According to a Paris telegram of December 6th the Serbian Information Bureau has received a despatch from Belgrade dated December 2nd in which it is stated that Prince Alexander of Serbia has received a delegation from the National Council of A gram (vide Report No. 97) and has accepted the union of the Kingdom of Serbia with the States of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes inhabiting the territories of the former Empire of Austria-Hungary.Mercantile Shipping. According to a telegram from Lord Derby, Sir Arthur Evans states that, great uneasiness exists with regard to the mercantile shipping claimed by the Serbians and Jugo-Slavs, a large portion of which lies in the harbour of Sebenico which is occupied by the Italians.UNITED STATES.Anglo-American Relations. Mr. Bayley (New York) states that British Day was enthusiastically celebrated in at least 3,000 localities.A meeting of some 5,000 persons was held in the New York Hippodrome. When the Chairman announced the King&apos;s message the whole audience rose and remained standing while it was read. A voice from the gallery called for &quot;Three cheers for a democratic King,&quot; which was given Avith great enthusiasm.An article has appeared in the New York World, AAdiich is a leading democratic neAvspaper, to the effect that, if the American interpretation of the Freedom of the Seas is not accepted, a large aud rapid expansion of the United States NaAy Avill take place on the basis of Iavo to every British keel laid cIoavu.Mr. Barclay is informed that Mr. Furnseth, of the Seamen&apos;s Union, has sailed for England. He thinks that Mr. Furnseth&apos;s object is to induce the British Seamen&apos;s Union to demand the same rates of Avages and conditions as obtain in the United States, which Avould enable the American Mercantile Marine to compete successfully Avith the British.German Appeals. -Mr. Barclay has been informed by the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs that considerable annoyance is felt by the Government of the United States at the numerous appeals which, emanate from the German aud Austrian
ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Food Supplies. Sir H. Rumbold reported on December 6th that the information which he had received not only from Austrian, but from other sources, led him to believe that a catastrophe &quot;was imminent at Vienna unless the Czechs could be indttced to release a portion of their stocks of coal. On December 4th representatives of the Burgomaster of Vienna handed Lord Acton a memorandum pointing out the desperate conditition of Vienna and the urgent need for supplies of food and coal.On December 6th Sir H. Rumbold reported that the German-Austrian Govern-ment had made a definite proposal that the Allies should forcibly seize Austrian tonnage for the purpose of revictualling the country. It was suggested that pressure should be brought to bear by the Entente on the Jugo-Slavs in the event of the latter&apos;s opposition.Imperial Intrigues. Sir H. Rumbold learns that, according to Prince Hohenlohe Waldehburg, the Empress Zita and her court have resumed their intrigues in favour of the reconstruction of a small. Austro-Hungarian Empire. This movement is supported by members of the Hungarian aristocracy, who hope to overthrow Count Karolyi. The Emperor has informed his Magyar supporters that he has not definitely renounced his rights to the Hapsburg crown. Efforts have also been made, though they have failed, to gain Bavarian support for the creation of a new Austrian Monarchy comprising South Germany and German Austria. The Emperor now bases his hopes on the support of the Pope, of the above-mentioned Magyars, and of a group of German Bohemian aristocrats who promise to start a monarchical movement in Bohemia.German Austria. According to a German Wireless message, the iSieues Wiener Tagblatt points out that the opposition of a portion, of the Entente Press to the union of German-Austria with Germany is due to a misconception of the present conditions obtaining in Germany, where millions of Germans ardently desire the creation of a country which shall have nothing in common with Imperialistic aims. It declares that the union should be based on the original national idea of 1S4S, which was not hostile but friendly to the Western Powers.It is reported through the same source that Count Czerin, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, will be a candidate at the coming elections to the German-Austrian National Assembly.Governments. The latter have therefore been informed that the Government of the United?States will refuse to accept any farther communications which are not simul-taneously communicated to the Allied Governments.Transport of Troops. Mr. Barclay has received a note from the State Department in which the Secretary for War expresses his deep appreciation of the assistance rendered by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the transportation of American troops abroad. He hopes that the British Shipping Controller may find it convenient to assign a considerable amount of British tonnage for the return of American troops, and wishes to be informed of the capacity of the tonnage available for this purpose.. Chile and Peru. Mr. Barclay reported on December 4th that he had been informed by the Assistant Secretary of State that Mr. Polk had unofficially advised the representatives of Chile and Peru to exercise moderation in the settlement of the differences between the two countries. Mr. Polk in an interview with Mr. Barclay, stated that the President had sent a friendly warning to the Presidents of Chile and Peru that the United States would hold the aggressor responsible in the event of any hostile action. Mr. Polk hoped that His Majesty&apos;s Government would concur in the opinion of the Government of the United States that it was inadvisable to sell any naval or military supplies to either of the two countries. Mr. Barclay has offered the assistance of the British Government in any measures tending to bring about a solution of the long standing question between them.
sHungary. A Times correspondent telegraphs from Milan on December 6th that Count Kafolyi&apos;s Cabinet has prepared a Dill guaranteeing the widest autonomy to all nationalities which are included within the Hungarian frontiers. It is hoped in this way to form a Danubian Federation among the Hungarian and Czecho-Slovak States, Poland, Rumania, Jugo-Slavia and even German-Austria, which would be attracted by her own interest to a Danubian rather than to a German Federation.According to a German Wireless report, 300 communes of the West Hungarian counties have informed the Hungarian Government that they have formed themselves into an independent republic.   They wish later to be united to German-Austria.Bohemia. Sir II. Rumbold has been informed of a statement made by Baron Haupt, the German-Austrian Minister Designate to Switzerland,.to the effect that the Germans in Bohemia would prefer to abandon their claim for autonomy within Bohemia, provided that German districts conterminous with German provinces were incorporated in Germany or German-Austria.German Wireless reports draw attention to alleged Czech excesses at Prague and Drunii. It is also reported through the same source that the Czecho-Slovak troops are compelling the poprdatioh of those parts of Hungary into which they have penetrated to vote for union with the Czecho-Slovak State.According to another German Wireless message, it is stated at Vienna that the more moderate Czech leaders are beginning to realise that the annexation of 2-i- million Germans belonging to an united Germau-Bohemian linguistic region, in violation of the right of self-determination, will prove impossible.Gorinthia. The Swedish Minister at Washington has communicated to Mr. Barclay a note in which the Austrian Government protests against the occupation of Ivlagenfurt and other parts of Gorinthia by Jago-Slav troops. The Austrian Government states that this action will inevitably lead to disorders, and urges that American troops may be quartered at Klagenfurt and Villach.GERMANY.General. Sir H. Rumbold reports that a member of the Legation has had an interview with Dr. Muehlon, who has just returned from Munich. The following is the gist of Dr. Muehlon&apos;s impressions of the internal situation of Germanj&apos;: Germany is suffering from complete moral collapse. The people have no energy left for the work of reconstruction, their leaders are incapable of forming any clear policy. The Governments of Ebert and Eisner have little authority, and their members can do little else but quarrel over their respective schemes which they are unable to carry out. The only real authority in the country is exercised by the local Soldiers&apos; Councils, and that is only due to the fact that they have arms. Even the best disciplined regiments soon come under their influence. In view of this a Constituent Assembly is likely to be nothing but a sham, since it cannot deprive the local Soldiers&apos; Councils of their power. In spite of the propaganda of the Spartacus group there is at present no great fear of Bolshevism. The average soldier does not betray any strong revolutionary tendencies, and, as in the case of the rest of the population, his chief aim seems to be to enjoy an easy time and do no work. The whole position in. Germany is dominated by the economic situation. The country is undoubtedly threatened with famine. There is little coal available and a complete lack of raw material. There will therefore be no employment for the demobilised army.Having given his impressions, Dr. Muehlon stated that Germany would make any concessions demanded of her in return for a regular supply of food and raw materials. He suggested that if an Allied Food Commission instituted a German organisation for the distribution of supplies, this organisation would quickly acquire political power, and could counteract the influence of the Soldiers&apos; Councils and the separatist tendencies of the various States. It might then become the nucleus of a stable central Government.Lord Kilmarnock has received information which endorses Dr; Muehlon&apos;s impressions regarding the anti-revolutionary attitude of the army. The soldiers only want order, and have no Socialistic desires. They do not even consider themselves beaten. The Generals are still powerful. Lord Kilmarnock learns that they have been able to prevent the overthrow of Dr. Solf, which is desired by the German
Government. The extreme party, however, is in continuous communication with the Bolshevists.An article appears in The Times o  December 10th giving an account of the Berlin riots. These apparently ended in a victory for the Government, backed by the soldiers who have lately returned from the front.Bavaria. Sir H. Rumbold is reliably informed that the revolution in Bavaria has been very superficial and mild in its character. There appears to be a strong feeling among the middle classes in favour of a restoration of the monarchy. Though there is an evident desire to escape the tyranny of Berlin, Sir 11. RumbolcVs informant does not think there is any strong separatist sentiment. Many Germans, he states, would like to see the whole Empire united under one constitutional sovereign such as. the Bavarian Crown Prince or Prince Max of Baden. He thinks the power of the Soldiers&apos; Councils lias been exaggerated. Dr. Muehlon does not consider that EisneFs position is by any means secure, and thinks that the Majority Socialist, Herr Auer, will be his successor.According to Sir 11. Rumbold an agreement is said to have been reached between Bavaria and Bohemia, by which the former is to receive consignments of Bohemian coal. The Berlin Government has protested against the separatist nature of this agreement.German Propaganda.--A memorandum has been drawn up in the French Embassy to the effect that German propaganda for the purpose of provoking disorders in allied countries is being carried on as actively in neutral capitals, especially in Berne, as before the armistice. The French Government proposes to instruct Marshal Foch to warn the German military- authorities that propaganda must be stopped.Information derived from German Wireless reports is given in the Appendix.NEUTRAL GROUP.THE BALTIC PROVINCES.Esthonia.  The situation of the Esthonian Government at Reval continues to be precarious. Not only is the country in danger from the threatened Bolshevist invasion, but also from the Northern Russian Army. On December 7th Lord kilmarnock reported that he had been informed by Poska (Helsingfors) that the North Russian Army under the leadership of the Higher Command of the German 8th Army, instead of continuing its operations against the Bolshevists, was marching on Reval for the purpose of overturning the Esthonian Government and re-establishing the Landesrat. In Mr. Touissen&apos;s opinion the working classes of Esthonia were likely to join hands with the Bolshevists to escape the rule of the Landesrat.On December 6th Lord kilmarnock reported that Bolshevist troops were landing at Assevin, and on the 9th that the Esthonian Army had retired to the Puessi. According to a telegram from the Esthonian delegate at Petrograd a transport containing 3,000 Bolshevist troops has left for Reval. He adds, however, that the Dreadnoughts and cruisers of the Russian Baltic Fleet are unseaworthy.The information which emanates from the various Esthonian delegates generally ends in an appeal for Entente assistance. The form which this assistance will take, as far as the British Government is concerned, is described in General and Western Report No. 97 under the Baltic Provinces. The subject has been further discussed by the Supreme Allied War Council, and the French Government has pointed out the danger of any definite commitment to a policy of intervention.Attention is drawn to the open letter addressed to Mr. Ramsay Macdonald by the delegation representing the Esthonian Republic at Stockholm, published in The Times of December 6th.Meanwhile Russian Wireless reports are busy with regard to Esthonia. Oh December 9th it &quot;was announced that the Revolutionary Esthonian Soviet Government had published a manifesto declaring the so-called Esthonian Provisional Government abolished and replaced by the Esthonian Soviet Government. Counter-revolutionary bands are to be exterminated and a Congress of the Esthonian workers to be convoked. A second Russian Wireless report states that the People&apos;s Bank has advanced ten -million roubles to the Esthonian Councils Republic.7001-2* 0
DENMARK.The League of Nations. According to a communique published in the Copenhagen Press on December 4th, which is apparently official, the Committees appointed by the three Scandinavian Governments for the purpose of examining the best method of safeguarding the common interests of the Neutral States at the conclusion of peace have agreed upon a proposal for the establishment of a League of Nations. This proposal includes (1) a general obligation to submit disputes between States to arbitration, (2) the institution of a permanent International Tribunal, (3) permanent international law conferences at The Hague, (4) the limitation of armaments, (5) the establishment of an international force. The Committees are to continue their discussions. Dr. Munch has become a member of the Danish, aud Mr. Branting of the Swedish, Committee.Bolshevism. Lord Kilmarnock has been informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Danish Minister is expected to leave Petrograd about December 10th.FINLAND.Food Supplies. According to a telegram dated December 4th, from Mr. Clive, the Finnish Government has informed Dr. Hoisti that the food situation is desperate. The Swedish Government, however, is willing to lend Finland 5,000 tons of grain, and Dr. Holsti has been instructed to approach the Governments of Great Britain and the United States regarding guarantees for reimbursement.Departure of German Troops. According to a German Wireless report of December 9th the first transport containing German troops left Finland on December 6th.   Transportation will be completed by the middle of the month.NETHERLANDS.Passage of the Scheldt. Sir W. Townley reported on December 7th that in view of the passage of the German troops through Limburg it was the opinion of the Military and Naval authorities that the British Government should demand the free passage of supplies for the Rhine armies of occupation via the Scheldt, in addition to a free passage through Limburg. On the 9th Sir W. Townley reported that ships were passing up the Scheldt unhindered by the Dutch authorities. He pointed out that recent disclosures show that the violation of Dutch neutrality by the German troops was not clue to unexpected pressure on the frontier but to an arrangement made between the Dutch authorities and the German Legation.Trade Agreement.-On November 25th an agreement was signed between the Royal Netherlands Government and the British, French, and Italian Governments and the War Trade Board of the United States. The following are among the more important clauses of the agreement : (1) As soon as employment is reasonably assured, all Dutch shipping shall at once resume its sailings, and not lie up. (2) The Netherlands Government undertakes that there will be no request for the return of Dutch shipping at present employed, by the Associated Governments until a further agreement has been arrived at with Dutch shipowners. (3) The Dutch Government is to recognise the agreement which is to be arranged between the Netherlands Oversea Trust and the Associated Governments, and will consent to the control of imports and exports provided for in such an agreement. The Dutch Government is to maintain the control of the export to the Central Powers of all imports into Holland, and the manufactures and products thereof. (4) No foodstuffs, with certain specified exceptions, are to be exported to the Central Powers until peace is signed. (5) The Associated Governments are to facilitate the importation of rations into Holland.Trade Restrictions. Sir W. Townley has been informed that it is proposed to eliminate from the General Black List the names of all the firms other than enemy firms which cannot be accused of definite untrustworthiness. The Hague Inter-Allied Committee has been requested to prepare a list of firms entitled to be removed from the Black List.
NORWAY.Bolshevism. On November 31st the Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed the Press report that Russian Red Guards had forced an entrance into the Norwegian Legation at Petrograd, and had stolen some Swiss archives which had been placed under its protection. With reference to this incident Mr. Ovey is informed that it will not necessarily lead to tlie Norwegian Government breaking off relations with the Bolshevist Government.The Minister for Foreign Affairs is non-committal as to the result of the Copen-hagen Conference which met to discuss the future relations between the Scandinavian Governments and the Bolshevists, though it is possible that some steps may be taken with regard to rouble transactions. Mr. Ovey states that a rumour is current to the effect that the strikers are being removed from rifles and machine guns in Norway.PERU.Relations loith Chile. Mr. Peunie (Lima) reports that the Peruvian Government realises that Peru would be unable to resist an attack from Chile, and that it consequently desires American or Allied intervention. It fears, too, an anti-Peruvian alliance between Bolivia and Chile.On December Gth Mr. Rennie reported that the Peruvian Government had been informed as to the attitude of the United States Government with regard to the situation (vide also under &quot; United States &quot;). The idea was gaining ground that an international situation had beeu created by the Chilian Government in order to detract attention from Chile&apos;s internal difficulties. Sir F. Stronge (Santiago) endorses this opinion, though he places the primary responsibility for the agitation respecting the Tacna Arica question on Peru.   Chilian feeling, he states, is becoming calmer.SPAIN.The New Government. Sir A. Iiardiuge learns that Count Romanones has failed to gain the support of the Marques de Alhucemas and Sehor Alba in the formation of his new Ministry. His own section of the Liberal Party is in a minority in the Cortes, but it is possible that he may have the support of Seiior Maura and the Conservatives at any rate in matters touching the interests of the Monarchy. Sir A. Hardinge is further informed that an agreement is imminent between Seiior Maura, Sehor Cambo, and Count Romanones with regard to a Home Rule policy for Catalonia.Austro-Hungarian Shipping. The Serbian Minister has asked Sir A. Hardinge whether the British Government intends to requisition the Austrian ships at Vigo and, if so, whether some 400 Jugo-Slav sailors at Barcelona can be employed on them. Meauwhile Sir A. Hardinge has been informed by the Italian Naval Attache that a number of Austrian ships in Spanish ports have hoisted the Italian flag.SWEDEN.Bolshevism. Mr. Clive reports that the staff of the Swedish Legation has arrived from Petrograd. The Swedish police have been instructed not to permit a number of Bolshevists, including the staff of the Bolshevist Legation, to leave Sweden, though Mr. Clive states that it is the intention of the Swedish Government to repatriate all Bolshevists in the near future.Mr. Clive learns that M. Litvinoff is visiting Scandinavia for the purpose of approaching the British Government with regard to securing recognition for the Bolshevist Government and the termination of Allied intervention in Russia.Lord Kihnarnock has been informed that in spite of the recall of the Swedish Legation from Russia, wireless communication is maintained between Stockholm and Petrograd with the knowledge of the Swedish Government.According to a German Wireless report a Swedish newspaper publishes a sensational article, from an inspired source, in which it is stated that Stockholm is the central point for financing Bolshevist propaganda.    The Stockholm &quot; Gross
Bank&quot; is supposed to be engaged in gigantic financial transactions for which the Bank has received fifteen million roubles in notes, while seven Bolshevist newspapers have been established in Sweden.The Anti-Entente Press. A protest has been signed by the Chairmen of the leading Bank businesses and industrial, associations against the recent attacks on Foreign Powers which have appeared in the Press, particularly in the Aflonbladet. It is declared that such articles do not represent Swedish public opinion and should be repressed.SWITZERLAND.Internal Situation. Sir If. Rumbold has been informed that the Socialist Party is organising a new strike, in consequence of which the First Division is only being partially demobilised. Considerable sums of money are being transferred from Germany to Switzerland, though it is pointed out that these are not necessarily being used for revolutionary propaganda.Sir H. Rumbold learns that revolutionary deserters have organised a Spartacus group in Zurich and are in communication with Haase and Liebknecht.The ex-Emperor of Austria. Sir H. Rumbold learns that the Swiss Minister at Vienna has been instructed to hint to the ex-Emperor not to press his request to be allowed to live in Switzerland.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.(N.B. Countries are arranged in alphabetical order under this heading.)General. Representation at the Peace Conference attracts the chief interest. German propaganda against the terms of the Armistice continues, in spite of the proved possibility of carrying out the terms without disaster to the Army.The Japanese Government is opposed to the participation at the Conference of representatives of neutral Powers, whose interests can be represented specially on occasions when their special questions are discussed (Sir C. Greene, December 7th). The general question of representation of smaller Allied and other States is being considered (Foreign Office to Lord Derby, December 10th).It is hoped that it will be possible to make arrangements for an aerial service between Paris and London during the Peace Conference (F.O. to Lord Derby, December 6th).Arab Kingdom. The Emir Feisal was treated by the French Government as a distinguished guest during his stay in France (Lord Derby, December 8th).Belgium.  There is a desire for a conference between Belgian, British, and French representatives before the Inter-Allied Conference (Lord Derby, December 6th; Sir F. Villiers, December 7th).Lord Derby on December 6th (received 10th) furnished the following summary of articles in the Temps and Debuts which, on account of their importance, are here quoted in extenso : Temps declares that just as invasion of Belgium filled first weeks of Avar, guarantees for Belgium must fill first chapter of peace. Article 7 of 1839 Treaty, prescribing perpetual neutrality, must be abrogated and problem of mouths of Scheldt and frontier questions raised by war must be settled, it was Holland herself who raised question of Scheldt when, on August 3rd, 19 14i, she addressed Note to Belgian Minister at The Hague declaring that Belgian lightships in estuary must be suppressed and that she would prevent ships going up river by night. Note was handed to Belgian Minister day on which German ultimatum expired and before Belgian Government were aware of entry of German troops into Belgium. Holland&apos;8 decision was clearly come to under pressure from Germany. Now that Berlin Government is about to publish secret documents on origin of war, Hague Cabinet would act wisely in divulging communications in which William 11., his Government or his General Staff may have conveyed to Dutch personages intentions and desires of Germany. It would be well to know at what time and in what terms promise was made that Gorman armies would respect Dutch territory. It would be well to know also on what date and under what form Germany demanded closing of the Scheldt. These revelations, if they turned out as anticipated, would have double advantage ; they would free Dutch Ministers from personal responsibility and would show policy which Germany followed. In interests of Holland herself, for whom Franco has always shown regard, it would be well for, light to be thrown on the subject at The Hague as soon as possible.   Problem of Scheldt has now entered domain
of realities. World witnessed absurd and tragic &quot;spectacle when Powers guaranteeing neutrality of Belgium, who were masters of the sea, were not able to boar help to Belgian Army in Antwerp by Scheldt. Future peace would not appear just or lasting if it did not bring absolute certainty that such, a situation would never occur again. Belgium has further guarantees and satisfactions to demand, for when her frontiers where laid down in 1831, they were fixed vis-a-vis to Netherlands according to frontier of 1790, but vis-a-vis to Prussia according to that of 1S15. Temps declares that Walloon Cantons unjustly allotted to Prussia must be returned to Belgium, and it cptotea letter from Louis Philippe to Marshal Maison saying that Belgium should have been given the line of the Lower Mouse, whose inhabitants were attached to her by manners, customs and opinions, and Duchies of Bouillon and Luxembourg and Abbeys St. Hubert, Stavulot and Malmedy. Temps observes that in front of a Germany who will not disarm, friendship of Prance, Belgium and Great Britain will be basis for peace of Europe. It is on that solid basis and with help of United States that future League of Nations must rest,Gauvain in B&amp;bats observes that servitudes imposed on Belgium were directed against France for benefit of Germany, and that it is to be hoped that Frances Allies and friends will remember this fact during peace negotiations.Brazil. Representation, at the Peace Conference has not been finally settled. It is possible that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will attend.&apos; Sehor Ray Barbarosa is also mentioned (Sir A. Peel, December oth-7th). The general question of invitation to attend is under consideration (F.O. to Lord Derby, December 10th).France. In M. OIemeneeau&apos;s opinion the Peace Conference should not take place before the new year (Lord Derby, December -1-th).The Supreme Command has suggested a meeting at Treves on December 12th or 13th to discuss the prolongation of the German Armistice (German Wireless, December! 9th). The German delegates, headed by Erzberger, have since left for Treves.Germany. An official protest has been received by His Majesty&apos;s Government through the Swiss Minister (signed by lierr Solf) against the Armistice terms, as affecting the evacuation by German forces of certain portions of the llhinelands, including Saarbrucken and Saarlouis (November 21th). According to German Wireless of December 5th, Frankfort and Darmstadt are to be included in the neutral zone, not the occupied region.Great Britain. The Home Office and Ministry of Labour have put forward a joint memorandum (P. 41, December 9th) recommending the establishment of a Committee of the Peace Congress to frame proposals for a permanent International organisation to deal with Labour questions. Proposals, if approved by the Congress, to be embodied in the Peace Treaties.Greece. The Greek delegates to the Peace Conference, in addition to M. Venizelos, will be M. Politis, Michael Ocopollos, and the Greek Ministers at Berne and Paris (M. Coromilas and Romanos) (Lord Granville, December 4-th).Japan. Japanese delegates arc expected toarrive via San Francisco about the middle of January. Their names are Marquis Saionji (to follow later) ; Baron Makino ; &apos; naval, military, and (unofficial) commercial and financial delegates (Sir C. Greene, December 7th.)PLedjaz (see Arab Kingdom).Norway,-In connection with the question of Norwegian representation at the Peace Conference, the Norwegian Minister in London has been informed that the annexation of Spitzbergen has not been under contemplation by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Persia. Mushaver is now reported to have been selected as representative (Sir P. Cox, December 8th, and F.O., December 10th).Rumania. M. Misu will, for the present, be the Rumanian representative at the Peace Conference. The question of the participation of M. Take Jonescu is also under consideration (Sir G. Barclay, December 0th).Turkey. Delay in carrying out the armistice terms in some districts is reported (Sir R. Wingate, December 9th).Uruguay. The question has been raised of inviting Uruguay to be represented at the Peace Conference (Mr. Mitchell Innes, Monte Video, December 8th).Venezuela. The question of invitation to attend the Peace Conference is under consideration (F.O. to Lord Derby, December 10th).7001-26

Walter Rathenau, addressing Colonel House, defended the German people from responsibility for the war policy. The &quot; League of the New Fatherland &quot; appealed for food to the whole world, as a safeguard against &quot; counter-revolutionary efforts.&quot;December Sth. On this and other days German Wireless followed the old tricky lines of German propaganda by quoting inspired articles in neutral papers as an indication of neutral opinion on the armistice terms and kindred subjects. The &quot;Imperial Government&quot; declined the Bavarian Prime Ministers proposal for a conference at Jena of German Free States representatives. The elections for the Bavarian Landtag have been fixed for January 12th.December Qth. An account was given of the encounters in Berlin on December 6th between &quot; troops true to the Government and supporters of the Spartacus Section.&quot; It was claimed that a large majority of the soldiers were on the side of the Government. The Saxon Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils had decided to deliver Saxon coal to Bavaria only in return for food supplies. A Papal Note published in the Ossevatore Romano was quoted, expressing joy at the prospect of peace. The alleged stoppage of shipping on the Rhine by the Belgians was reported. A French wireless message from Lyons, dated December 3rd, was quoted to the effect that &quot; Luxemburg will demand its dissolution from the German Customs Union and will unite with unselfish France (sic).&quot; [Belgian opinions on the future of Luxemburg are well known.] &quot; The League of the WorlcVs Students &quot; (sic), the Head of the Salvation Army, and leading clergymen, were said to have published in Sweden an appeal, couched in religious terms, for brotherly love. The Berlin Press based upon this an appeal for a &quot; real peace of reconciliation.&quot;December 10th. The following meetings on &quot; Manifestation Sunday &quot; (December Sth) were reported: (I) Fourteen meetings in covered halls of the Majority Social Democratic Party, favouring the convocation of a National Assembly and national unity. (2) Three open-air meetings of Independent Social Democrats, sparsely attended owing to the weather.

Also a subsequent open-air meeting, date not given, addressed by Scheidemann and Ebert, who advocated the convocation of a Constituent National Assembly as speedily as possible.Negotiations between the Government and the Executive Committee of the Workmeivs and Soldiers&apos; Councils of Greater Berlin, held on December 7th, were
said to have resulted iu a decision to co-operate &quot; in the service of the Revolution.&quot; The solemn entry into Berlin of the first big formation of troops was announced for December 10th. [In view of the power lying with the still mobilised army, the attitude of those who control it appears now to he the dominating factor in the situation.   So far, the3r had not shown their hand clearly.]German Wireless of this date contained an interesting contribution to economic discussion of the question of payment by Germany of heavy indemnities.The release of Rhine shipping, and control by an Inter-Allied Shipping Committee, wras announced.December 11th.
