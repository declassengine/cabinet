APPENDIXtoWestern and General Report No. 104.Extracts from Report circulated by the Home Secretary on January 28th (G.T. G713).BOLSHEVISM.The present position as regards the spread of Bolshevism appears to be as follows : Russia [not dealt with in Western Report].Bolshevism is spreading in German Austria and to some slight extent among the Czech o-Slovaks.In Germany its position is obscure. The Spartacists have been beaten in Berlin, and the Government appears to realise the danger of Bolshevism, but at the same time there are signs that they are prepared to take the risk ot Bolshevik outbreaks in Germany if only the poison may spread among the Allies.On the other hand, the Governments of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Holland, Italy and Spain are now thoroughly awakened to the danger.The Danish Government is preventing Russians from entering the country. The Swedes are taking steps to root out the local Bolshevik agencies. The Norwegians appear to think that the movement will make no progress unless the Allies are driven out of Russia or the Spartacists are successful in Germany. The Swiss Government is taking stringent measures. After expelling the Bolshevik Legation they set to work methodically to investigate the revolutionary movement in the country, and they have arrested a considerable number-of persons and interned them in a fortress. At the same time, they appear to have information that a fresh revolutionary movement is brewing, in Italy, Bolshevism appears to have had a set back, but matters change so rapidly in that countiy that this may be only temporary. The position as regards Spain, is not encouraging. There is a great deal of Bolshevik propaganda in and about Barcelona, and as soon as it was decided to arrest the Russian leaders with a view to deporting them they disappeared. Nevertheless, the Government is fully alive to its danger and is seeking British co-operation in tracking down foreign emissaries.Great efforts are being made by Bolshevik propagandists to penetrate France and England. Only a few days ago the Swiss Police found nearly a ton of Bolshevik leaflets and pamphlets printed in English and French in some secret printing press, which has not yet been discovered ; but the propaganda has borne little fruit as yet, for in the unrest which is accompanying the process of demobilisation there is as yet no trace of any political motive.Bulgaria [not dealt with in Western Report].B.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.&apos; Increased Rations to Neutrals. The Allied Blockade Committee has decided that the following communication (with slight variations) should be made to the four northern neutral Governments by the representatives in those countries of the Associated Governments :  ^&quot;Associated Governments of Great Britain, France, Italy and the United States (represented herein by the War Trade Board), desiring to share with the people of . . . . the benefits which have accrued from the signing of the armistice and the consequent availability for more liberal distribution of certain essential commodities whose exportation to .... from the territories of the Associated Governments during the period of active hostilities was necessarily limited by the existence of war conditions, have made provision whereby the people of ... . will be enabled to secure additional quantities of the articles provided for in the agreement of ... . As expressed in the above-mentioned agreement, it has always been the hope of the Associated Governments that conditious would at some time permit the increase of the rations therein specified, and the said Governments, feeling now that the initiation of peace negotiations warrants action in fulfilment of such desire, have agreed that the quantity of commodities Avhose importation into .... will be facilitated under the provisions of the above-mentioned agreement shall be increased to the limit of the quantities set out in the amended schedule annexed to this note, such increase to be effective from the 1st October 1918.&quot;ALLIED  GROUP.BELGIUM.German Agricultural Machinery.- The question of allocation of agricultural machinery to be surrendered by the Germans, in place of railway rolling stock demanded at Spa on December 17th, is under consideration, and a proposal has been put forward by France that the Belgian share of this machinery shall be one-fifth, the remainder going to France (Sir R. Grahame, February 2nd).Japanese Shipping. The Japanese Minister, having enquired about this subject, has been informed by the Foreign Minister that the condition of Belgian harbours prevents Japanese ships being received for the present (Sir F. Villiers, February 3rd).CHINA.Expense of Repatriation of Enemy Subjects. His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Japanese Government are each willing to pay one quarter of this expense, and the French are also ready to pay a share, which they hope to recover from Germany in due course. The Chinese Government will take an equal share with the Allied Governments (telegrams to and from Sir J. Jordan, January 29th-31st).Repatriation of Goalies from Russia. The Japanese view, with which Sir T. Jordan concurs, is that more information should be obtained about these coolies before any definite policy is decided (Sir C. Greene and Sir J. Jordan, January 30th).
Conflict between President and Military Party.-Peace Conference discussions are said to have accentuated the divergence of interests between the Military Party and the President (Sir J. Jordan, February 1st).FRANCE.Visa to Passports. Reference to Paris has been requested by the French before granting a visa from Switzerland to Prance, either for Government officials or private Individuals, who have come from (or passed through) enemy territory (Sir 11. Rum bold, February 1st).[For the Paris Conference, see under &quot; Peace Discussions &quot; on page 9.]PORTUGAL.Situation at Oporto. On January 30th, 1I.M.S. Liverpool was instructed to visit Opoito. All was reported quiet on that day, and the Monarchist movement was said to have given satisfaction generally (Sir L. Carnegie, January 30th). Repatriation of Portuguese woodmen by the British Ministry of Labour is affected (Sub-Committee telegram, February 4th). The question of recognition of the Royalist Government by Spain and Great Britain lias been raised (through Sir A. Hardinge, February 2nd).Situation near Averiro. Skirmishing continued, both sides claiming to be successful (Sir L. Carnegie, January 30th).SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Montenegro. The proposal by General d&apos;Esperey (see last week&apos;s Report) for occupying Montenegro is being discussed (telegrams to and from Lord Derby, January 29th-February 2nd), especially as affecting the prospects of arriving at a correct conclusion about the wishes of the population, without - Serbian or other external influence. Representations have been put forward (Sir G. Grahame, February 3rd) through Paris about the continuance of British financial assistance to Montenegro.Fiume and Susah. The Allied Admirals at Venice submitted administrative proposals on January 15th for &quot;the occupation of Fiume, and the establishment at Susak of a Jugo-Slav Council. The Italian Admiral did not join in supporting the proposals (Sir R. Rodd informed January 29th).Serbian Flag at Sea. The Italian Government is opposed on principle to the Serbian flag being accepted for (late) Austrian vessels in the Adriatic, (Lord Derby informed February 1st).UNITED   STATES   OF   AMERICA.Russian Situation. According to U.S.A. Wireless of January 30th, &quot;Great anxiety has been caused over the Russian situation,.primarily owing to the defeat of the Allied troops south of Archangel, coupled with the widespread public belief that the plan for a conference at Princes Island is a complete fiasco.&quot;War Legislation. The State Department publishes an opinion that for the purposes of war-time legislation the war will not be considered as at an end until after&quot; the treaty of peace has been formulated and ratified (Mr. Barclay, January 29th).cuba.Situation as affecting the United States. The situation is being very carefully watched by the United States Government, who are prepared to deal with any crisis that may develop (Mr. Barclay, January 31st).
Press Reports of Peace Conference. These reports seem to have raised con-siderable resentment in the Senate, and strong Republican opposition to undertaking financial or military obligations in connection with German Colonies (Mr. Barclay, February 1st).U.S. Navy. On January 31st the Naval Affairs Committee agreed unanimously to a three years&apos; construction programme costing 000,000.000 dollars. Actual construction to be postponed until February 1st, 1920, and the programme to be suspended if the maintenance of competitive armaments should become unnecessary owing to the establishment of a tribunal capable of ensuring a peaceful settlement of international disputes (Mr. Barclay, February 1st);Press Attacks on Great Britain. These continue, especially in the Hearst Press. The new British Embargo List is being used for the purpose (Mr. Barclay, February 1st).Industrial Conditions in Great- Britain. A general report on this subject was telegraphed to Mr. Barclay on February 1st.[See also under &quot; Cuba.&quot;]ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Czecho-Slovaks. The outburst of feeling occasioned by the occupation of Teschen by Czecho-Slovak troops has been allayed by the declaration signed by the Peace delegates at. Paris and by the Czecho-Slovak ami Polish representatives. According to the terms of the declaration hostilities are to cease pending the settlement&apos; of territorial claims by the Peace Conference. Meanwhile that part of the railway line to the north of Teschen and the mining regions will remain in the occupation of the Czech troops, while the southern section of the line starting from and including the town of Teschen down to Jablunkau will be entrusted to the military supervision of the Poles.   A Commission of Control is to proceed to Teschen.German-Austria. According to a German Wireless report of February 1th Dr. Bauer is stated to have addressed a large demonstration organised by the Social Democrats of Vienna in the following terms :  &quot;The German State Government sent us an invitation yesterday to appoint a German-Austrian representative for the new German State Commission, which, in accordance with the draft for the preliminary German Constitution, is .to take the place of the former Federal Council. I am convinced that our State Council will accept this invitation gratefully, and that, in the near future, for the first time since 1SS0, we will have an Austrian plenipotentiary in the German Federal Council.&quot;Hungary. Mr. Robertson (The Hague) learns that fears are entertained in certain quarters with regard to the spread of Bolshevism in Hungary. Count Karolyi is reported to be giving way more and more to the Bolshevik.element.GERMANY.The National Assembly.-A Memorandum (G.T. 673S) gives the official results ofthe election to the National Assembly : Majority Socialists   -         -         -         - - 105Christian Peoples&apos; Party         -            - - 91German Democratic Party   -         -         - - 75German National People&apos;s Party (Conservatives)     - 38German Peopled Party (National Liberals) - 22Various other Parties         -         -         - - total   &apos;         - - 421
Tlie &quot;strongest party, that of the Majority Socialists, falls short by 46 of an absolute majority of. the Assembly, and the Memorandum predicts the establishment of a Coalition Government with the bourgeois Democrats, which would provide a Avorking majority of 59 over all other parties, ft is thought probable that inanjr of the Catholic Centre Deputies (the Christian Peoples&apos; Party), especially those from the Rhenish and Westphalian industrial districts who are politically advanced in their views, will also support the Majority Socialists. This party has received a large measure of support from Protestants as well as Catholics owing to lierr Adolf lioffmann&apos;s secularist edicts separating Church and State and abolishing religious instruction in schools. The Ebert Government, on the other hand, has lost a certain amount&quot;of prestige owing to its hesitating policy in the early stages of the Spartacus revolt.State Elect was. (1) Prussia. A German Wireless report of February 2nd gives the results of the election as follows : Majority Social Democrats - 145Christian People&apos;s Party - - -    S5German Democratic Party - - -     65National People&apos;s Party - - -    48German People&apos;s Party - 24Independent Socialists - - 24Other Parties - - - - -10The results had not been obtained from three electoral districts.(2) Hesse. The Dusseldbrf Nachtrichten gives the following results (January 30th):-Majority Socialists     - -         -          -          - 31German Democratic Party          -             -             - 13Centre Party -          - -          -          -          - 13German People&apos;s Party              -             -             - 7National People&apos;s Party -         -         -         - 5Independent Socialist -             -             - 1(3) Saxony. According to the latest reports the elections for the Saxon People&apos;s Chamber resulted as follows (German Wireless, February 5th) :  Majority Socialists     - -            -             - 40German Democratic Party -            -         - 21Independent Socialists -            -            - 15National People&apos;s Party - -            -         - 14German People&apos;s Party -             -            - 5Christian People&apos;s Party - -             -         - I(4) Duchy of Saxony-Altenburg and Principality of Seliioarzburg-Sondershausen. -According to a German Wireless report of January 30th, the Social Democratic Parties have obtained large majorities.The Constitution. On January 30th the German Press published the text of the Constitutional Act which is to be submitted to the National Assembly7.(1) The task of the German National Constitutional Assembly is to draft the future Federal Constitution and pass other urgent laws. (2) The consent of the Committee of States is necessary for the introduction of proposals by the Federal Government in the National Assembly. Each free German State shall have at least one vote in that Committee of States. Large States receiA-c in principle one A^ote for each million inhabitants. Thus Prussia has 19, Bavaria seven, Saxony, Wurttemberg and Baden each three, Hesse two, and other States each one vote in the Committee. A member of the Federal Government shall preside OA-er the House of States. If German-Austria joins Germany it shall be represented in the Committee of States by number of votes to be fixed by Federal laAV. Until that time it participates Avith an&apos; advisory vote. If no agreement is reached betAveen the Federal Government and the Committee of States either party may submit its proposal to the National Assembly for decision. (3) Members of the Federal Government and the House of States have the right to participate in the debates of the National Assembly and speak at any time to set forth standpoint of their respective Governments. (4) Future Federal Constitution shall be passed by National Assembly.   Territorial possession of Free States cannot7H7S. ill &apos; B
be changed without their consent. Federal Laws are passed hy agreement between National Assembly and Committee of States. If no agreement can be reached Federal President must effect decision through referendum. (6) The Federal President has charge of the affairs of the Federation. He will conclude treaties with foreign Powers and receive Ministers. The declaration of war and the conclusion of peace are effected by Federal Law. As soon as the German Federation joins a League of Nations which excludes secret treaties, all treaties with members of League of Nations must be approved by National Assembly. The National Assembly elects President by single vote. (8) The Federal President appoints the Ministry to which all .Federal authorities and supreme Army command are subordinated. Federal Ministers require the confidence of the National Assembly to retain office. (9) All civil and military decisions, and the ordinances of the President, must be counter-signed bv Federal Minister.Wilhelmshaven. On January 31st it was reported through the wireless stations of the German Government that the Spartacus revolt at Wilhelmshaven had been completely suppressed. It was further stated on February 2nd that the workmen had been disarmed.Bremen. The situation at Bremen is still obscure.. The following news is provided by the German Wireless reports. The Government sent troops to re-establish order and to ensure the arrival and departure of provision ships. Herr Noske made the following statement to representatives of the Cress : &quot; In case the minority in Bremen should offer forcible resistance, strong measures will be taken, and in that case they will be taken without regard to consequences &quot; (February 1st). The Government demanded the disarmament of the dock workers (February 2nd). The Soldiers&apos; Councils of Hamburg conducted a sympathetic demonstration and passed resolutions condemning the Imperial Government. The mobilisation of the 9th Army Corps for use against the Government was threatened (February 3rd). On the night of February 1st an agreement was reached between the repre-sentatives of the Government troops commanded by Colonel Gerstenberg, the Upper Soldiers&apos; Council of Greater Hamburg, the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council of Oldenburg, the Soldiers&apos; Council of the 9th Army Corps, the Bremen Soldiers&apos; Council, the National Commissaries and the Majority Socialists. The workmen expressed their willingness to surrender their arms to the 9th Army Corps. The latter pledged itself to effect the re-establishment of order (February 3rd). Mean-while the Government troops were reinforced by the arrival of a Brigade of Guards Cavalry and a Reserve Division. The Communists and the Independent Social Democrats have joined the Majority Socialists &quot;jmder pressure of circumstances &quot; (February 4th).According to a Reuter telegram via Copenhagen, dated February Sth, the Government troops entered Bremen on February 4th after heavy fighting.Position of Soldiers&apos; Councils. The Central Council of the German Socialist Republic has convoked a sitting of the Central Councils of all Army Corps in Berlin for Tuesday, February 4th, in order to discuss the Bill for the new adjustment of the power of command (German Wireless, February 2nd).Wei-mar. The Soldiers&apos; Councils of the .11th and loth Army Corps met in Eisenach and resolved, by 02 votes to 52, not to protect the National Assembly in Weimar. The resolution further stated that the Assembly was opposed to the bringing of Guard troops to Weimar (German Wireless, February 3rd).German Socialist Leaders and the War. Attention is drawn to a Memorandum (G.T. 0701) published by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office, quoting the utterances by German&apos; Socialist leaders during the war.NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.Labour Unrest. On January 28th Sir R. Tower reported that there was still a deadlock in the negotiations for the termination of the strike in the port of Buenos Ayres.   The Government insisted that a clause in the agreement relating to the
boycott of linns and individuals should be withheld from the knowledge of the workmen, while the Shipping Association decided to reject all measures involving-secrecy. Sir R. Tower is apprehensive of the effect which precipitate intervention on the part of the Government may produce in the present unsettled condition of the -country, and has therefore advised British shipping companies to meet the Government in a conciliatory spirit. On February 2nd Sir11. Tower telegraphed that the strike was officially announced to be at an end. Shipping companies are satisfied with the conditions.Sir R. Tower has received information-from Rio Gallegos that a state of unrest obtains in Patagonia, lie has asked the Argentine Government to protect British interests. On February 1st he reported that this had been promised and that troops had been landed.BALTIC PROVINCES.Gum-land. According to a Russian Wireless report (January 3ist) the Bolsheviks have crossed the A^indau and have occupied Goldiugen (about 50 miles N.E. of Libau). On the 30th Lord kilmarnock reported that the situation at Libau had improved. The Lettish troops were reported in the Press to have retaken Schaulen. Winclau is reported to have been captured by the Bolsheviks, who are advancing southwards (Lord kilmarnock, February 4).Lord Kihnarnock learns (February 1st) that a German loan of 10,000,000 marks has been suggested, but that the Lettish Government will only accept it if it is. offered unconditionally.   It is stated from a Sw-edish source that the Germans wish to operate against Mitau and Riga, while Swedish and Lettish troops are to operate in North Courland.   The need for food at Libau is reported as being urgent.Cable connection has been re-established between Libau and Copenhagen, but censorship is being exercised by the Germans (Lord Kihnarnock, January 28th), The Great North Telegraph Company has protested against this (January 29th).A telegram has been received, in Paris to the effect that the Swedish volunteer Mission to Latvia has been abandoned owing to the Lettish Governments inability to provide the necessary funds (February 2nd).Esthonia. The following news is given in the Russian Wireless reports : The Bolsheviks have evacuated the village of Novoe Kriushi (23 versts south of Narva) -and the railway station at Neuhausen (between Walk and Pskov). They have retired to a line 10 versts to the south-west of Walk.CHILE.Mission to Paris. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Santiago reports that the Chilian Government is sending an unofficial mission to Paris consisting of Sehor Yanery, the former Prime Minister, Senor Tocomal, formerly Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Sehor Villanueva, President of the Bank of Chile. The ostensible objects of the mission are commercial and financial, but Sir F. Stronge thinks that its real motive is to keep in touch with the Peace Congress and to sound the representatives of the Allied Powers on the Tacna Arica question.DENMARK.Social Democratic Party.  Lord Kilmarnock reports that in spite of the assurances given by Mr. Kiefer, an article has appeared in the Social Democrat inveighing against the Allied representatives at Copenhagen and stating that a message has been sent by the leaders of the Social Democratic Party to the corre-sponding parties in France and Great Britain complaining of the persecution carried out on the Danish Labour Party. Lord Kilmarnock has, however, received a memorandum from the Workmeivs Association endeavouring to explain away its connection with Mr. Helphand, a German agent. The French representative at Copenhagen has suggested that the supply of British coal to Denmark, for which Mr. Kiefer is working, should be made dependent upon a change in the management
of the Association. Lord Kilmarnock, however; is in favour of ending the feud which is only used by the Socialist parties to misrepresent the Allied attitude towards the Danish working classes.Trade. Lord Kilmarnock learns that sufficient orders have been booked by American firms to cover Danish requirements in iron goods for a considerable period. These requirements consist roughly in about 25,000 tons of shipbuilding material and about 30,000 tons of rails. The impression is current in business circles that when all possible orders have been booked the Americans will insist on the removal of all trade restrictions.FINLAND.Recognition. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Helsingfors reports that a statement was made to the Finnish Press by the French Consul on January 25th, to the effect that the French Government has requested the Allied Governments to recognise Finland&apos;s independence, and that Great Britain has already assented.Mr. Bell reported on January 31st that General Mannerheim had fulfilled the promises made by him in London, (1) the Prince of Hesse renounced the throne on December 14th, 1918, (2) the Finnish representative in Berlin was recalled on January 27th; (3) the last of the German officers who served in the Finnish Army left the country on January 22nd ; (4) the French Government was requested on January Gth to provide officers for the reorganisation of the General Staff (vide also Report No. 103, p. 7).German and Bolshevik Intrigues. The War Office learns that a Finnish Jaeger Regiment, stationed at ATborg, which is commanded by Colonel Ausfeldt, a German officer who has become a naturalised Finn, is the centre of anti-Ally and Bolshevik intrigue. Russophile Finnish officers have been dismissed. At the same time a large number of Jews are entering Finland, and, with the aid of the Jaegers, are carrying on a campaign against the pro-Ally Russians. Mr. Bell has been asked to corroborate these statements.On the other hand, the Finnish Government has informed His Majesty&apos;s representatn^e that it does not entertain any fears with regard to a Bolshevik rising. The Bolshevik element is badly organised while the provincial population supports the Government. On January 31st a message was received from Mr. Bell stating that though he was aware of the existence of &quot; intensified &quot; German propaganda, pro-Ally sentiment was slowly increasing.Russian Committee. On January 31st Mr. Bell transmitted a telegram on behalf of the President of the Russian Aid Committee in Finland for the Russian representatives in Allied countries and for the Russian commands which are recognised by the Allies. The Committee, which is recognised by the Finnish Government, has been reorganised so as to represent intellectual, labour, commercial, industrial, and financial interests. The aims of the Committee are (1) to give aid to Russian refugees, (2) to act in co-operation with Russian organisations for the re-establishment of order in Russia, (3) to raise troops and provide funds for their maintenance.NETHERLANDS.Transport of Troops. Mr. Robertson has asked the Netherlands Government to-permit demobilisation of the army of occupation to be carried out through Dutch territory, and an officer has already arrived from Cologne for the purpose of establishing a demobilisation base at Rotterdam. The further question has now arisen as to whether men on leave from the 2nd and 4th Armies may proceed to Rotterdam and Antwerp respectively for embarkation to England. Mr. Robertson has called attention to the necessity for frank and tactful dealing with the Government. Otherwise he thinks that any men with arms will either be turned back from the-frontier or will be disarmed, as in the case of the German troops in their passage through Limburg. It would also be in the power of the Netherlands Government to create an intolerable situation for the military authorities at Rotterdam. The War-Cabinet has decided that men who are being demobilised must also carry arms./
NORWAY.Bolshevik Agents. Mr. Ovey reported on January 29th that four Bolshevik agents were to leave Cliristiania on that day in order to return to Russia in company with A^orovski (vide Sweden). They have not been technically expelled, but have been persuaded to leave the country under a threat of compulsion.SPAIN.. Political Situation. Attention is drawn to a Memorandum (G.T. 6733) issued by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Ollice dealing with the present situation in Spain. There are four problems which confront the nation, and they are enumerated as follows : (I.) The parliamentary and ministerial situation arising from the fact that Count Romauones is at the head of a Cabinet formed out of his own small party, and is entirely dependent on the goodwill of other parties for the maintenance of his power. Count Romanones enjoys, however, considerable personal prestige owing partly to his recent visit to Paris, but to a greater extent to his fearless advocacy of the Allied cause during the war. At the same time the Extreme Left and the Regionalists fear that, in the event of his resignation, Count Romauones might be succeeded by Sehor Dato and the Conservative Party, which is the strongest in the Chamber. (2) The Regionalist, and especially the Catalan problem. A corn-mission has been appointed to prepare a home-rule measure to be submitted to Parliament. Though the Republicans, Socialists, and Sehor Dato refused to sit on this Commission, it included Senor Oierva and Sehor Alba. It appointed a Committee under Sehor Maura to frame a scheme for autonomy which has already been drafted. There are three sections of opinion : the Centralist and anti-Regionalist element, strongest at Madrid and represented by Senor Dato ; the Moderate party, represented by Sehor Cambo and the ^business interests ; the Left Wing, composed of Socialists and Republicans who are using the Catalan problem to press for the destruction of the Monarchy, if necessary, by a violent revolution. (3) The industrial situation and the prevalence of crime and Bolshevism. The centre of unrest is Barcelona, but on January 30th Sir A. Hardinge reported that the Government was more optimistic with regard to the situation and had decided not to proclaim a state of siege. (4) The problem of Morocco and Spain&apos;s relations with France and Great Britain. The most which Spain can expect is the maintenance of the status quo. There is a tendency to turn to Great Britain in order to restrain French ambition. With regard to Gibraltar it is generally realised that no alteration in Great Britain&apos;s position is practicable.The Catalan Problem.--Sir A. Hardinge reports that the debate on Catalan autonomy was opened in the Cortes on January 28th. Sehor Cambo took his stand upon the draft statute voted by the Mancomunidad. The Prime Minister replied in an effective speech that the Government Bill must form the basis for disoussion. Senor Dato declared that, the abstention of the Conservatives from the Home Rule Commission did not imply hostility to its objects. He thought that the Budget should precede discussion of the Catalan question.Enemy Shipping. On January 30th His Majesty&apos;s Government informed Lord Derby that a report had been received to the effect that the German Government was secretly negotiating with the Spanish Government with regard to enemy vessels lying iu Spanish ports, and suggested that some central authority should be established to deal with the whole question of enemy shipping in neutral ports. Sir A. Hardinge (January 31st) does not give credence to this report, and states (February 2nd) that the Spanish Government only insists upon the retention of the six ships (vide Report No. 104, page 8).
