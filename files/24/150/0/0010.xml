WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Shipping Rates. The communication of the new rates for the Atlantic by a representative of British lines to Mr. Rossiter was .reported hy Mr. Barclay on January 26th.

Extracts from a report from the Home Secretary (January 28th) are given in an Appendix to this Report.ALLIED  GROUP.BRAZIL.Finance Minister. Since the death, of the President, Seiior Ribeiro, regarded as one of the best financiers in Brazil, has been appointed Minister of Finance (Sir A. Peel, January 23rd).CHINA.Repatriation of Coolies from Russia. The Chinese Government is said to be afraid to take steps to repatriate Chinese coolies from Russia, on account of their infection with Bolshevism, and the difficulty of communication with them.Financial Assistance. The Japanese Government is willing to share in an offer of financial help to China under certain conditions (Sir J. Jordan, January 21st).Conflict of Interests. The question of the menace to peace in the East which may result from conflicts between the interests of different countries formed the subject of a telegram from Sir J. Jordan, dated January 23rd.Repatriation of Enemy Subjects. Good progress is being made in this matter (Sir J. Jordan, January 24th.-27.th) and the necessary mandates have been published ; ships have been asked for for the purpose, to be at Shanghai on March 1st.CUBA.Railway Strike. -The railway strike, which is estimated to have reduced sugar production by 50 per cent., has now been settled, but further trouble with other Unions may occur (Mr. Cowan, January 22nd).FRANCE.Demobilisation. On January 17th (received 20th) Lord Derby called attention to the statement by M. Clemenceau, in reply to criticism in the Chamber, that 2,000,000 men would be demobilised by March 1st.Trade with Occupied Territories, etc. (Decrees of September 20th, 1914, forbidding trade with Austria-Hungary and Germany). Derogations affecting occupied territories on the left bank of the Rhine have been entrusted to a commission of French Delegates (Lord Derby, January 21st). The question of the effect upon existing Allied blockade arrangements is being discussed (Lord Derby, January 28th). The question has been raised of inspection by the French of dye factories in the British zone (Lord Derby, January 27th).
o ONaval Policy. According to a statement by the Minister of Marine published in the Temps of January 23rd, a naval policy is necessary for France (1) to reconstitute her national wealth and to guarantee her economic development; (2) to enable her to exploit to the full her colonial empire; (3) to give her in the world the rank and )       the position which were worthy of her.Labour Unrest. A Report circulated by the Home Secretary (G.T. 6713, January 28th) stated that labour unrest in France is net far behind what is reported from England. The method of dealing in France with the question of unemployment on demobilisation was indicated as a danger.ITALY.Relationship with Bolshevik Government. The Italian Government is not in favour of having any relationship (January 22nd).PANAMA.Labour &quot;Troubles. There have been strike troubles with loss of life at Bocasdelfofd (United Fruit Company). There is a surplus of labour, and it is not considered desirable to encourage the return to the country at present of volunteers for war service (Sir C. Mallet, January 21st-23rd). According to a later report (January 28th) the United Fruit Company is prepared to employ 1,000 such volunteers recruited in Panama and now demobilised in West Indies.PORTUGAL.Internal Situation. According to reports from Sir A. Hardinge (January 22nd) and Sir L. Carnegie (January 23rd-28th) troops at Oporto would not act against Royalist insurgents. There was severe fightiug outside Lisbon on the 23rd, and the despatch of a British man-of-war was suggested. Fighting continued all day on the 24th. By the 25th the revolution had been suppressed, and it was proposed to send troops to Oporto. British subjects at Lisbon asked for a ship to be sent to Oporto to ascertain the situation, which was obscure. H.M.S. Liverpool arrived at Lisbon on the 28th.   Skirmishes near Aveiro were reported.Ministerial Changes. On January 26th the Ministry resigned and Seuhor Relvas, late Minister to Madrid, who does not belong to any party, was forming a new Government strictly Republican in character.SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Montenegro. General d&apos;Esperey proposes to go to Cettinje to find out the attitude of the population and take such steps as may be necessary to ensure peace (Lord Derby, January 22nd).Serbia. According to a report from Belgrade. M. Korosketz, as Vice-President of the United Government of Slavonia, spoke recently very strongly on the question of Trieste and Goritzia, which he called the &quot;heart and lungs&quot; of the Southern Slavs.   A Croatian newspaper criticises this speech (Sir C. des Graz, January 24th).UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.The Laic Colonel Rooseveldt. A memorial ceremony in Congress and services all over the United States will be held, on January 23rd (Mr. Barclay).Anti-British Propaganda. Mr. Barclay on January 25th drew attention to Bernard Shaw&apos;s articles in the Neio York American, in which Great Britain is classed with Germany in motives for going to war. Articles on Ireland are foreshadowed. Mr. Barclay furnished proofs of the use of the articles as propaganda against the British.
ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Czecho-Slovaks.1 Nauen Wireless of January 17th reported that Czech patrols had been stationed along the &quot; Czecho-Bavarian frontier.&quot; On the 25th German Wireless reported, on Press authority, that there had been fighting in Silesia (?) between Czechs and Poles. Colonel Wade (January 22nd-27th) forwarded reports of the frontiers facing Poland and Galicia having been occupied by the Czechs, of friction between them and the Poles, and of a Czech advance in Austria and Galicia.The following message has been issued by wireless, apparently from some Austrian station under Czech control (January 2Sth, Serial 8027) :  &quot;To Colonel Wade, British Mission, Senatorska 35, Warsaw.&quot; In an interview to-clay at noon (Sunday) President Masaryk authorised me to inform you as follows : &apos; In view of the unsatisfactory conditions in the province of Eastern Silesia, the Czecho-Slovak Government decided to occupy the province with Czecho-Slovak troops. Further, all statements appearing in the Press and posters declaring that the Entente have decided to occupy Eastern Silesia are without his authorisation, and are entirely incorrect. Further, that the British, American, French and Italian officers mentioned in the papers and posters are attached to the Czecho-Slovak Army, and take their orders from the Czecho-Slovak Government. Further, that no troops except Czecho-Slovak legions are being employed.&apos; Please inform General Barthelmy and Colonel Smith. (Signed) Commander Rawlings.&quot; &quot; To the Chief, General Staff, Polish Army, Warsaw.&quot; The Chief of the Allies&apos; Mission requests an urgent reply as to whether all causes of conflict between the Polish and Czech States have disappeared. At the same time state what is the reply of the Polish Government regarding the delivery of coal. (Signed)      Potocki, Captain.&quot;Hungary.-A. report dated January 14th has been received from Allied Ministers at Bucharest via .Paris (Lord Derby, January 17th, received 20th) to the effect that Ministers at Budapest had taken steps to continue by force of arms the war against Czechs and Rumanians, especially in Transylvania.Austrian Finance.-According to a War Office estimate (D.S.I. January 29th) it is thought that Austria must be involved through the war to the extent of at least 5,000,000,000Z., and if this is added to her pre-war debt, the Hungarian debt, and the so-called &quot; common &quot; debt, the total amounts to about 6,250,000,OOOZ. at the normal rate of exchange.GERMANY.General. On January 22nd-25th Mr. Robertson forwarded precis of the attitude of the German Press on the present internal situation. The Conservative Press generally rejects the proposed new Federal Constitution drafted by the Depart-ment of the Interior, and is particularly incensed at the intended elimination of Prussian ascendancy in Germany. The Democratic Press approves the Draft Constitution.The, Constitution. The following points to be submitted to the National Assembly, taken from the above authority, are additional to those reported in Western Report No. 103 (page 6): The &quot; entire field of public transportation,&quot; separation of Church and State, constitution of the new Reichstag (People&apos;s House of 400 members elected by direct vote, and House of States of 70 members elected by State legislators). President (elected for seven years by direct popular vote with absolute majority), who has no veto, can be deposed by popular vote after impeachment by two-thirds vote.Fight for order in Berlin.-The Political Intelligence Department on January 23rd furnished a report (G.T. 6700) on the later stage of events in Berlin, under this1 Shown temporarily under their geographical heading.
title. The Minority Socialists are not considered to have improved their position, and their leaders are attacked even more violently by the Spartacists than by the Government organs. The Majority Socialists have a strong prejudice against the old officer class. The troops in recent events were quite conscious of what was involved and fought for ordered democratic government against Bolshevik anarchy.Attitude of German. Social Democrats to Internationale. German Wireless of January 27th quotes from V orwdrtz the statement that &quot;No people starts a revolution in order to help a foreign nation which they have been fighting for four years on the fields of battle. Neither will German Social Democracy ask the representatives of Entente Socialism to do so. German Social Democrats have taken up the standpoint that every country is to regulate its own internal matters, and that Socialism in every country must find its own path for progress.&quot;Posen and West Prussia. German Wireless of January 2ord-27th accuses the Poles of causing serious harm to business and private persons by interrupting all traffic in moneyr from the Province of Posen. Various other accusations are made, and it was announced (25th) that negotiations would possibly take 2^1ace at Berlin within a week &quot; at which, naturally, the Polish question will be reserved for the Peace Conference.&quot; The Prussian Government is said to have caucelied the decision of the State Ministry of February 7th, 18S2, that persons whose mother language is Polish were not to be employed as officials in Posen and West Prussia, or Oppeln. (Information from Warsaw (January 25th) contains accusations against the authorities in West Prussia for actions against the Poles in that and other Provinces.)Position of Soldiers&apos;&apos; Councils in Peace-Time- Army. The War Ministry has published, &quot; in agreement with the State Government and the Central Council of the workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils in the War Ministry,&quot; a decree under this heading. The supervising activity of these Councils in the Army &quot;involves the duty of guaranteeing that the leaders shall not misuse their powers against the existing Government &quot; (Gorman Wireless, January 23rd). After a meeting of Soldiers&apos; Councils of Greater Berlin on January 27th, a committee of the two Social Democratic parties was set up to draw up proposals for modifying the enactments.Riots in Hamburg. Spartacus riots in Hamburg on January 22nd and the proclamation of martial law by the local Soviet were reported by Air. Robertson on January 27th and German Wireless on the 24th. (Various strikes at other places, reported by German Wireless, have been described in the Press during the past week.)Wilhelmshaveii. German Wireless of January 29th reported that Communists had succeeded in taking possession of the town and of all public buildings in Varel.Bolshevism and Spartacism in Germany.-On January 27th Mr. Robertson reported the attitude of the German Press towards Bolshevism and Spartacism, and called attention to an article by Hans A7orst in the Tageblatt (23rd), stating that the danger was not. past, since the power which supiports Lenin is intellectual, &quot;and in Germany there are few indications of intellectual power whereby new revolutions can be anticipated, for example, the &quot;communal Government of Prussia is still reactionary.&quot; German Wireless of January 28th reported that the Bolshevik agitator Itadek was still in Berlin, and an order for his arrest had been issued.Socialisation of Mines.-The Workmen&apos;s Council for the Imperial district of Merseburg has taken over all the mining establishments for coal, potash, and copper near Halle, Mannsfol, Weissenfeld, and Zeitz, with the view of their most speedy socialisation, as well as the Supreme Alining Office at Halle. Any possible resistance against the socialisation of the mining establishments is to be broken by a general strike. (German Wireless, January 23rd).Weimar. The convocation of the National Assembly has been announced by a semi-official news bureau for February Gth. The protection of the Assembly- is to be entrusted to the &quot; Berlin Volunteer Regiment,&quot; which will be under the orders of the Government and not incorporated with the Police.Prussia. German Wireless of January 28lh reported that the elections for the Prussian Constituent Assembly were held on the 26th, and no final reports had been received up to the 28th.71 S3-56
GNEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.Labour Unrest.-On January 26th Sir R. Tower reported that a settlement had not been readied with regard to the strike in the port of Buenos Aires. This is said to be due to the fact that the Minister of Marine insists on the terms of the settlement between the shipping companies and their employees being kept secret. Further strikes are threatened.Wheat Crop. The crop for export from the South is not expected to amount to 3,00O,.O0U tons. The recent unfavourable weather has had a bad effect in general (War Office Summary, January 27th).BALTIC PROVINCES.Esthonia. Mr. Manning, the Esthonian delegate at Copenhagen, has informed Lord Kilmarnock that, according to the plans formed by the Esthouian Government, it is intended that the army should advance as far east as Yamburg and take up a fortified position along the River Luga. According to the reports which he lias received the Bolsheviks are completely demoralised. In view of this favourable change on the Eastern front he has proposed to the Lettish Government, that volunteers should no longer be recruited in Denmark for the Esthonian army, since the Letts were in a more precarious situation. Moreover, any operations starting from Libau would react on the southern front of Esthonia. According to latest reports (January 28th) the situation is fairly satisfactory near Narva although resistance by the Bolsheviks is stiffening on that front, and Lenin is said to have ordered a great attack to murder all the population. In the south the situation is not so satisfactory. The Esthonians are said to have no desire to invade Russian territory. Famine is threatened in areas devasted by the Bolsheviks.Mr. Menning states that many atrocities were committed by the Bolshevik army during its advance into Esthonia. The country was plundered of all its available supplies of food, and over a thousand civilians are reported to have been murdered. German Wireless of January 28th described the behaviour of the Bolshevik Red units as &quot; altogether bestial,&quot; and gave details.Courland. M. Ulmanis, the Prime Minister of the Lettish Government at Libau, has approached Lord Kilmarnock with a view to obtaining assistance from the British. Government in the shape of arms, money and food. If actual military intervention was precluded, M. Ulmanis hoped to secure a loan of 1,000,OOOL, which was essential for raising a volunteer force in Stockholm. The German Government had offered to furnish a loan, but he refused to enter into negotiations for this purpose. It is reported (through Lord Kilmarnock, January 27th-28th) that Swedish would be preferred to German military assistance. A detachment of Swedish volunteers is expected. German resistance is weakening and that of the Letts becoming stiffer. A loan is desired by the Lettish Government.DENMARK.Prisoners of War. On January 2.3rd Lord. Kilmarnock reported that there were about one thousand Russian prisoners of war in Denmark. Arrangements had been made by the Danish Government for the repatriation of the majority, who accepted the Bolshevik regime, to Russia. The remainder were to be allowed to stay in Denmark at the Governments expense on promise of repayment by the old Russian Legation when circumstances permitted. The thanks of His Majesty&apos;s Government have been communicated for the hospitality and kindness shown by the Danes to British prisoners (January 28th).FINLAND.Political Situation. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Helsingfors reports that a political controversy is raging between the Government and the pro-German party in
the Diet. The controversy arose out of the refusal of M. Enckell, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to allow a German theatrical company to enter Finland.The German sympathisers are trying to use the incident to bring about a Cabinet crisis. M. EnckeU&apos;s position is further complicated by the attitude of the French Government which desires a reconstruction of the Cabinet. His Majesty&apos;s representa-tive thinks that the Allied Governments should supportthe Minister for Foreign Affairs, whose policy is by no means opposed to them. He adds that the Swedish Minister is antagonistic to the present Government.Mr. Clive learns that the elections will take place on March 1st and 3rd. It is probable that General Mannerheim will remain in power since he has the support of all parties except the Socialists, who are not expected to obtain more than GO to SO seats.Recognition. The question of recognising the independence of Finland as a Sovereign State by the British and French Governments under certain conditions is being considered (Foreign office, January 27th).Bolshevik Relations. It is estimated that there are some 13,000 Finnish subjects in Russia. The Bolshevik Government has approached the Finnish Government with the suggestion that it woidd agree to their repatriation in return for permission to purchase a quantity of paper and pulp from Finland. The Finnish Government, though expressing its desire to avoid any action tending to prolong the Bolshevik regime, has entered into preliminary negotiations on the above lines. 30,000 Russians are said to be taking refuge in Finland from the terror of the Bolsheviks, including about-2,000 pro-Entente officers.LUXEMBURG-Relations with Entente Powers. In a Note addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the Government of Luxemburg &quot;takes the liberty of placing the country&apos;s rights under the protection and guardianship of the British GbVerhmeht.&quot; The Note goes on to express the hope that Luxemburg may retain its independence and establish an economic union with the Allied Powers.MEXICO.Political Situation. Carranza has issued a manifesto in which he ascribes the present political unrest to premature anticipation of the presidential elections. He calls upon the Constitutionalist party to show an united front and warns his followers against the machinations of their opponents, who, supported by foreign interests, are aiming at a reactionary movement against his regime. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Mexico points out that the presidential elections do not take place for another two years, and thinks that the real motive Lung behind the manifesto is Carranza&apos;s fear that he is losing the allegiance of some of his supporters.In an interview with Mr. Cummins the United States Ambassador again alluded -to the subject of the joint- intervention of the United States and Great Britain in Mexico. He asserted that in view of his proposals for a League of Nations, Mr. Wilson, could not logically support the Monroe doctrine, but he realised that in refusing to interfere in Mexican affairs and in holding the United States responsible for her losses Great Britain was serving her best interests. Mr. Cummins points out that Carranza&apos;s strong anti-Allied policy may be explained by (1) the German assertion that news is falsified by the Allied censors ; (2) a belief in Germany&apos;s powers of recuperation ; (3) the success with which Carranza has defied President Wilson during the past four years ; (4) the provision made by Allied statesmen with regard to the weaker nations.Recognition of carranza Government by Spain, This recognition appears to have been attributable to precipitate action (Mr. Cummins, January 25th).NETHERLANDS.Bolshevism.-The Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Mr. Robertson -of the measures which, are being taken to combat Bolshevism in Holland. Foreign residents suspected of carrying on Bolshevik propaganda are being interned with a
svi ew to their ultimate repatriation.   Banking and Stock Exchange authorities have be en requested to inform the Minister of Justice of any suspicious monetary trans-actions which come to their knowledge.   A strict watch-is being maintained on the rentiers to prevent the entry of Bolshevik agents into the country.SPAIN.Governments Foreign Policy. Parliament opened on January 21st. Sir A. Hardinge reports that many questions were put to Count, Romanones with regard to the Governments foreign policy. Count Romanones declined to discuss the question of Gibraltar. Spai.u&apos;s position in Morocco was defined by the Pact of Carthagena and other treaties. With regard to Tangier she -demanded the maintenance of the status quo. Count Romanones emphatically declared that he would stand or fall in defence of Spain&apos;s right to the ceded German ships.Sir A. Hardinge states that, though Count Romanones&apos; statements made a good impression, the attitude of the Conservatives is by no means friendly to him, and they are probably intriguing with the disaffected Liberals. Sir A. Hardinge doubts whether any leader could manage the present mixed Cortes, and is in favour of a dissolution as the only remedy.Austro-Hungarian Shipping.  On January 24th the Naval Attaches of the Allied Powers decided upon the allocation of Austrian vessels lying in Spanish ports between France and Italy.Sir A. Hardinge reported (January 27th) that the Government had agreed to the proposed use of these vessels and had asked His Majest,y&apos;s Government to agree, to the proposed utilisation by Spain of the six German vessels in her possession.SWEDEN.Bolshevism. Mr. Clive has been informed by the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs that, though there is no evidence of the existence of Bolshevism among the police, the latter are not very expert at, watching political, suspects. Mr. Clive is disappointed in the measures so far taken by the Government to control Bolshevik agents, but he has made arrangements for the co-operation of the three Allied Legations with a Swedish official for this*purpose.On January 25th Mr. Clive reported that the departure of M A^orovski and the Bolshevik Mission had been postponed until January 30th.M. Vorovski asserted that he had private affairs to settle and refused to leave at an earlier date unless ejected from the country hy force.On January 24th the following message was sent to M. Vorovski hy the Russian Government: &quot;Please tell the Swedish Government that you object to leaving Sweden, seeing that your presence in Stockholm is necessary for commercial purposes. We intend to make an exception in favour of Sweden as regards the extraordinary tax and to give facilities for trade. For that purpose your presence in Stockholm is indispensable.&quot;Engine Drivers&apos; Strike. Mediation with the Union has not succeeded. A. diminished service on lines affected had been kept going up to January 27th.Constitutional Reform. A. Memorandum (G.T. 6693) has been issued by the Foreign Office dealing with constitutional reform in Sweden. These reforms are embodied in a Bill which was passed in the Riksdag on December 17th by 167 votes to 12 the minority representing the Extreme Left or Bolshevik element. The principal clauses of the present Bill deal with the communal and county franchise upon which rest the elections to the First Chamber. It is provided, inter alia, that (.1) general and equal communal franchise is to be exercised after the completion of the twenty-third year ; (2) the right to vote is not to be affected by non-payment of rates, except in the case of those who are in arrears for more than two out of three immediately -preceding years ; (3) with regard to the County Council elections, the right to vote will be acquired by those entitled to vote in the communes but after the completion of the twenty-seventh year. Measures directly involving changes in the constitution, such as the extension of the franchise for the Second Chamber and female suffrage, must await an ordinary session of the Riksdag.  The proposals are the product of the
labours of a special Franchise Committee, the two most prominent members of which were Mr. Swartz (Conservative) and Mr. Branting (Socialist). Though the Bill in. some respects represents a compromise, the Conservatives have receded from many of their most cherished principles.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.(N.Bi--Countries are arranged in alphabetical order under this heading.)General.
