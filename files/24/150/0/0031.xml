Sir J. Jordan&apos;s remarks on the &quot; sine qua nou&quot; of a settlement of the Shantung question are interesting.France (page 2). -The decision of the Confederation Generale du Travail and the Socialist Party to co-operate is important. The C.G.T. has always emphasised the trades unionist as opposed to the political character of the labour movement, while the Socialist Party lays chief stress on the revolutionary character of the strikes and the question of intervention in Russia and Hungary.Italy (page 3). A list is given of the members of Signor Nittfs new Ministry. The fall of Signor Orlando&apos;s Government heralds the resurrection of Giolittian and pro-German influence which gathers further strength from the serious industrial situation.United States (page 4). -The Republican Party does not appear to have gained in prestige by its recent attacks on the League of Nations.An Irish and anti-British campaign is being organised throughout the country.Enemy Countries.Austria-Hungary (page 5).

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Enemy Shipping in South America. An agreement lias been readied with the United States whereby Great Britain is to be responsible Cor dealing with the question of enemy ships in Argentina, Mexico, Columbia, and Chile (Foreign Office, June 22nd).The Southport Conference. The following Socialist delegates arrived in England on June 24th to take part in the Southport Conference: Messieurs Longuet, Huysmans, Renauclel, Joubaiix (French), and Signor Darragond (Italian) (Lord Derby, June 22nd).Trade with Soviet Governments. It has been decided that after the signature of peace, though no.public announcement will be made indicating a resumption of trade, measures will no longer be taken to prevent commodities from reaching Hungary and Bolshevik Russia.Womeris Congress. Lord Acton reports that from the loth to the 20th May a Congress of Women was held in Zurich, representatives having come together both from neutral and belligerent States in order to discuss political, economic, and labour conditions of to-day, and particularly with a view to establishing a rapprocliememt between members of countries hitherto at war -with one another. The Congress was attended by 120 delegates from 11- countries, and was presided over by Miss Jane Adams, of the United States. Mrs. Philip Snowden, Dr. Ethel Williams, Mrs. Pethick Lawrence, and Mrs. Despard were the principal British delegates. The following-resolution, passed unanimously, illustrates the attitude of the Congress : &quot; The Congress expresses its entire sympathy with all organisations whether of political nature or labour organisations -which throughout the entire world at the present moment reject the Versailles Treaty and strive for a permanent and just peace, thus serving justice.&quot;Dissatisfaction was also expressed with the League of Nations.ALLIED  GROUP.CHINA.Political Situation.- Sir J. Jordan is of opinion that, although measures have been taken to put a stop to the importation of arms and munitions and ruinous Japanese loans, the military party and the financial strain which they have imposed upon the country must sooner or later bring about the collapse of China.The Shantung problem still continues to absorb public attention. To ensure a satisfactory settlement Sir J. Jordan states that two conditions must be fulfilled: (1) the railways in Shantung must belong to the Chinese Government, and the Japanese connection with their management must be the same as the foreign connection with other railways ; (2) Tsingtao must lie opened as an ordinary treaty port with an International settlement on the Shanghai model.FRANCE.The Strikes. On June .17th Lord Derby reported that the strike of metal workers still continued, though negotiations were proceeding between representatives of the employers and men. A large number of miners were on strike throughout the country. The miners of the Nord and the Pas-de-Oaiais were sending a deputation to Paris to request the Ministers of Labour and Reconstruction to arbitrate on the question of
9 O&quot;wages. Tlie deputation received full powers to accept any decision they thought fit, and were thus acting independently of the Federation.The Confederation Geuerale du Travail and the Socialist Party are reported to have agreed to co-operate with each other (Lord Derbj&apos;, June 23rd).ITALY.The Government.   On July 19th the Government was overwhelmingly defeated on a motion to sit in Secret Committee.The President of the Council, referring to the Eastern and Adriatic frontier, said that Italy had not refused to seek for a solution.which would secure the consent of all the great Powers represented at the Peace Conference, but remained firm in claiming those territories which the Allies had declared justly attributable to her. He appreciated the desire of Parliament for discussion, but trusted 1 hey would understand the urgent necessity for discretion in dealing with a situation so delicate. He there-fore proposed that the House should constitute itself into a Secret Committee.The reception of the speech was hostile. Signor Nitti made a proposal more apparently than really conciliatory, to begin with a public sitting, and hold one or two secret sittings if necessity arose. To this the President of the Council replied th.it he could admit of no discussion in public of questions on which he had stated that silence must be maintained. None of the Allied Parliaments had discussed International questions.   The Government could not accept divided authority.Opposition was shown on all sides of the House, by the Extreme Left,&quot; by the Federation of National Defence Groups, and by Giolitti&apos;s adherents.As a result of its defeat the Government resigned.It is announced in The Times of June 22nd that the new Cabinet is constituted as follows : Premier  and  Minister of  the Interior,   Public Instruction, Signor RacceUi.Signor Nitti. Public Works, Signor Pautauo.Foreign Affairs, Signor Tittoni. Transports, Signor Devito.Colonies, Signor Luigi Rossi. Agriculture, Signor Visdcchi,Justice   and    Public   Worship,   Signor   Industry and Commerce, Labour, Food,Mortara. Signor Dante Ferraris.Finance, Signor Tedesco. Posts and Telegraphs, Signor Chimienti.Treasury, Signor Schauzer. Military Assistance and War  Pensions,Marine   and   War   (ad   interim),   Rear-       Signor Dacomo.Admiral Sechi. Liberated Provinces, Signor Cesare Nava.Several of these Ministers are followers of Giolitti, most conspicuous being Signor Tedesco and Signor Schauzer. The military party is opposed to Signor Nitti and the Parliamentary Federation of National Defence has issued a declaration adhering to the polic,y hitherto pursued.Sir R. Rodd endorses the statement of a strongly anti-German informant to the effect that the vote in Parliament represented a resurrection of German influences (Sir R. Rodd, June 19th to 22nd).Italy and her Allies. The following extract from an article in the Perseveranza (June 8th) illustrates the attitude of a certain section of the Italian Press: &quot;The present situation in Europe is, characterised by a double effort on the part of France to strengthen pan-Slavism without measure and to crush all non-Slav peoples without pity, from the Bui gar to the Magyar and German. . . . The German-Magyar-Riunanian dyke between the Slavs of the north and the Slavs of south is weakening, and France is trying to corrode it as much as possible. The result will be the formation of an enormous bloc of 200,000,000 souls extending from the Volga to the Baltic and the iEgean Sea. . . . For Italy the existence of a vigorous and united Germany in the centre of Europe, between the Alps and the northern seas, is a vital necessity independently of any policy France may follow with regard to Italy. A similar reasoning must be made as to the German function with regard to the dominion of the Anglo-Saxon over four-fifths of the globe and the intention to reduce the last fifth, Europe, to a colony.&quot;The Industrial Situation. A. Memorandum on the industrial situation has been received from Sir R. Rodd. The chief difficulty is the lack of coal, which is due to the export control still in force in the United Kingdom and the difficulty of obtaining
shipping for transport. Shipping is only available for about 400,000 tons of coal, 300,000 tons of which are chartered by the Italian Government. In addition to the coal shortage, industry is faced with increasing demands on the part of labour and a general lack of raw materials. As a result, several important firms have been already compelled to close down or else are about to do so. The Memorandum concludes :   &quot;The continued demands on the part of the workmen and the increased difficulty of obtaining raw material of all sorts is spreading profound depression. England is accused of trying to kill Italian industry by cutting off supplies. While prepared to recognise the shortage of raw material in the United Kingdom, Italian manufacturers represent that this treatment is ill-advised. Great Britain, it is urged, should make an effort to assist Italy to a moderate extent, where small concessions made, even at a sacrifice, mean so much more. If Italian industry does not survive the present crisis the country will cease to be a good market for British trade, and will certainly have recourse to Germany in the future for assistance wherewith to build up again the commercial enterprise and production the development of which had been so pheno-menally rapid during the last 40 years.&quot;SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Montenegro aud Serbia. Count do Salis states that according to prevalent opinion Montenegro cannot stand alone economically. The majority of Montenegrins are therefore in favour of union with a Jugo-Slav State. They are, however, strongly opposed to incorporation in the kingdom of Serbia and desire to enter the union on the same footing as the Slovene, Croatian and Serbian communities, i.e., as Monte-negro, not as a part of Serbia. The Karageorgevitch dynasty, though not popular, would probably be accepted, though the Serbian aggressive policy may defeat its own ends. The present regime of officials from Belgrade prevents the free election of a Montenegrin Assembly, which is the only means of securing a representative Government.UNITED STATES.The League of Nations. President. Wilson has refused to communicate to the Senate the text of the draft Treaty. Mr. Lindsay reports that there is still plenty of anti-League feeling in the country, but that opposition, both in the Press and amongst politicians, is increasingly disposed to compromise on the lines of accepting the League and the Treaty with reservations.On June 24th Mr. Lindsay reported that the Knox resolution was not to be pressed to a vote and that this decision marked the defeat of a determined attack on the Covenant. Republican prestige had been seriously damaged by the partisan character of the opposition to a measure which in principle was approved by the country as a whole. The Party&apos;s position had not been improved by its appeals in turn to racial prejudice, to anti-British, and anti-Catholic feeling.The Irish Question. A regular Irish campaign has been organised in all parts of the United States and many meetings are held which are largely attended. The principal speakers in the East arc Judge Cohalan, the former head of American information Bureau, and Mr. Ryan of the Irish Mission. Much anti-English language is used and considerable sums of money are being collected. There is a distinct tendency to use these meetings for the purpose of attacking the League of Nations.li. is worth noting that any further approach of the United States to the vortex of European politics must tend to affect adversely the value of the Irish vole in America in that it will create large bodies of voters who will be disposed to vote on national lines rather than on lines of internal politics. It. is easy to understand such a prospect alarms thinking men who arc unwilling to see the quarrels of Europe transferred to American soil and thus gives them an anti-League bias. It cannot fail to be especially displeasing to the Irish (Mr. Lindsay, June 17th).
A USTKIA-HUNG A ft V.Hungary. Eugen Varga, tlie People&apos;s Commissary for Social Production, has made a long statement regarding the present position of production in the Hungarian Republic. He pointed out that the work falls into three divisions, destruction, preservation, and construction. The institutions connected with capitalism must be destixryed, but what was really useful in them must be preserved, and kept for the new system of production. The constructive task consisted in replacing the capitalistic administration of industry by the organisation of a proletarian administration, both in individual industries and in the organism of the Stato as a whole. Hanks had all been socialised, and some 8U0 financial institutions had been taken over by the State. Socialisation of the land had been already carried out to the extent of two million cadastral yokes.In mining and other large scale industries, in which .10,000 men were employed, socialisation had been completed. At the bead of the socialised concerns, there were Commissaries for production and controlling Councils of Workers.Production, however, had greatly diminished. Eor instance, the production per man in coal mining was 011I3&quot; 38 per cent, of what it was at the beginning of this year, and 50 per cent, in comparison with individual production in peace time. In the engineering trade also the falling off in production was very considerable.Varga ascribed this to the abolition of capitalistic discipline over the workers, but was confident that improvement would come, lie also drew attention to the latent opposition between mental and physical workers (Budapest, June 19th).In a speech before the Soviet Congress the Commander-in-Chief stated that, although Hungarian troops were winning victory after victory against the Czechs, their spirits were not very high owing to the fact that they were not being properly supported from the rear. The spirit of &quot;defeatism,&quot; which had been making itself felt for some time in Budapest, and the alarmist and false reports which reached the front, were poisoning the mind of the troops. This&quot;was increased by the lack of reinforcements and the bad treatment of their families by the new bureaucracy.As a result of this and other speeches, pointing out the danger in which the country stood, a resolution was unanimously adopted to order a general mobilisation of the workers and to entrust the Governing Council with the carrying out of the details. The members of the Workers&apos; Councils were to exert all their efforts, both at the front and behind the front, to ensure that the negotiation should be successfully carried out (Budapest, June 21st).The first session of the Soviet Congress ended its labours with the adoption of the draft Constitution and the election of a Central Executive Committee of 143 members.According to a AYireless report from Budapest, dated June 24th, Josef Haubrich, Commandant of Budapest, has been empowered to proclaim martial law for the purpose of combating counter-revolutionary attempts. He has announced that from to-day all seditious intrigues against the Soviet Republic and its institutions, all incitements to pogroms and to religious or racial hatred will be punished by martial law. All meetings and processions are forbidden, except meetings of trades unions and party meetings.General Pelle has informed the Hungarian Supreme Command that the following dispositions are to be carried out on the Czecho-Slovak front :  (1) Hostilities are to cease at 5 ami. on June 24th.(2) Immediately afterwards those Hungarian Iroops which are beyond the frontier, as fixed by the Allied Governments on June 13th, will withdraw by midday to a line 15 kilometres behind the front held by them at the time of the cessation of hostilities.(3) For the troops west of the line Bartfa-Nagysaros-Margitfalva-Szepsi-Ujiak-Szanticska the withdrawal is to be completed by 11.59 pan. on June 26th ; for those to the east of this line, by 11.59 p.m. on June 28th.(4) The execution of the movement wilf be watched by British, French and American officers.(5) No acts of violence, &amp;c, are to be committed in the territory to be evacuated. Hungarian reports state that the Czechs continue their attacks along the whole front.8194-lb .1JENEMY GROUP.
His Majesty&apos;s representative at Bucharest learns that a number of German battalions from Mackensen&apos;s former army are lighting for the Hungarians and that German officers are directing the Hungarian artillery.German-Austria. A wireless report of June I Gth states that demonstrations took place on June 15th in Vienna in consequence of Communist agitations. The demonstrators, who attempted to pierce a police cordon, were repulsed by machine-gun lire. There were 10 killed and about 100 wounded. Order has been restored, but the situation must be regarded as serious. The police, yielding to pressure from the Communist demonstrators, were compelled to give tip the leaders of the movement, including Dr. Friedlander. This is interpreted as an act of weakness. The Volkswehr maintained a neutral attitude in yesterday&apos;s events, but it is certain that they are no longer to be relied on.Herr Renner in a Note to M. Clemenceau drew attention to the danger of the Communistic movement for which he declared Hungarian propaganda and material support were responsible. This information, however, was accompanied by an appeal for a rectification of the Austro-Hungariau frontier in favour of Austria.Slovakia. According to wireless reports from Budapest a Soviet Government has been established in Slovakia. Telegrams of greeting were sent to Lenin and the Hungarian Soviet Government, but a message has also been addressed to Prague declaring that the new Government wishes to live in closest unity with the Czech Proletariat, who are of the same race-in Moravia, Silesia, and Bohemia. A provisional Revolutionary Executive Committee has been elected, and volunteers for the Red Army are being enrolled.GERMANY.The Political Situation and the Peace. On June 18th the Cabinet and the members of the Peace Delegation discussed the Entente&apos;s reply to the German counter proposals. Differences of opinion immediately became apparent. The majority of the Social Democrats and the Centre Party decided upon acceptance, the majority of the Democrats, together with the Peace Delegates and the financial and economic experts, for rejection. A minority, however, of the Democratic Party, consisting of the South German group around Herr von Payer and the group around Freiherr von Richthofen, were in favour of acceptance. Of the Ministers, Herren Erzberger, Bell, David, Wissel, Schmidt, Bauer and Noske were for acceptance; Herren Scheidemann, Landsberg, Dernberg and Count von Brockdorff-Rantzau for refusal.On June 19th the Cabinet resigned. Following upon an abortive attempt by ITerr Mailer to form a Government, Herr Bauer, or perhaps Herr Erzberger, the most prominent member of the Centre Party, who is said to have been the moving spirit in the negotiations (Lord Acton, June 18th), succeeded in forming a Cabinet as follows : President of the Imperial Ministry  - -   Herr Bauer.Minister of Finance     - - -   IIerr Erzberger.Minister for Foreign Affairs - Herr Midler.Minister of the Interior - -    Dr. David.Minister of Commerce        ...   1 lerr Wissell.Minister of Laboitr      - - -   Herr Schlicke.Minister of Food     - Herr Schmidt.Minister of Defence     ...   Herr Noske.Minister of Posts     ....   Herr Giesberts.Minister of the Treasury - -   Herr Mayer-Kaufbatim.Entrusted with the formation of a Ministry of Communications, the conduct of the business of the Ministry of the Colonies -   Dr. Bell.On June 22nd a vote of confidence in the now Ministry was carried by 236 to 89 votes. There Avere 08 abstentions. Sir W. Townley (The Hague) reports that, according to Herr Behrons, who is one of the German delegates on the Armistice Commission, the German people as a whole, as well as the commercial and financial interests, were determined to obtain peace. Herr Behrens, however, believes that civil war will break out in the Eastern Provinces of Germany and that a spread of Bolshevism is unavoidable.
On June 22nd Herr Bauer addressed a Xote (W.C.P. 1040) to the Allied and Associated Governments, stating that the German Government regarded the peace conditions as being in sharp contrast with the principle which was accepted, before the conclusion of the armistice by the Allied aud Associated Governments on the one hand and Germany on the other as being binding. All attempts to conduct, negotiations verbally had failed, and the concessions eventually allowed only reduced the severity of the conditions in a small degree. The people honestly wished for a lasting peace, but in this peace the Government was compelled to bow to force and declined all responsibility as regards the consequences which might be threatened against Germany when, as was bound to happen, the impossibility of carrying out the conditions came to light. The German Government had received passionate expressions of opinion from the population in the districts to be cut off in the East, to the effect that they would oppose themselves to the separation of those districts which had for the greater part been German for many centuries, by all the means they possessed. The Government, therefore, found itself compelled to decline all responsibility for any difficulties which might arise from the resistance of the inhabitants against their separation from Germany. The Government also refused to accpet Article 231 of the Treaty, which required Germany to admit herself solely responsible for the war, and the articles demanding the surrender of individuals for trial.   It protested also against the seizure of the colonies.In reply to a Note requesting the extension of the time . limit for signature, the Allied and Associated Governments affirmed that the time for discussion had passed. No reservations or qnali cations would be admitted, and Germany would be held responsible for the execution of every stipulation of the Treaty.The final Note of the German Government was as follows : &quot; The Government of the German Republic has seen with consternation from the last, communication of the Allied and Associated Governments that the latter are resolved to wrest from Germany by sheer force even the acceptance of those conditions of peace which, though devoid of material significance, pursue the object of taking away its honour from the German people. The honour of the German people will remain untouched by any act of violence.&quot; The German people, after the frightful sufferings of the last few years, lacks all means of defending its honour by external action. Yielding to overwhelming force, but without on that account abandoning its view in regard to the unheard of injustice of the conditions of peace, the Government of the German Republic therefore declares that it is ready to accept and sign the conditions of peace imposed by the Allied and Associated Governments.&quot;Socialisation of Mines. At the 21st general meeting of the German Miners&apos; Union, whose membership on March 31st, 1919, comprised 422,610 persons, a reso-lution was passed that the Union was in favour of the socialisation of the mining industry on democratic lines, socialisation to include the mineraL wealth, production, and sale of products (Kolnischc Zeitung, June I Sth).The Iron Industry. The weekly Economic Report (June 10th) issued by the Berlin Foreign Office, contains the following facts about the iron industry :  The successive strikes since November 191S and the considerable rises in salaries have consumed almost the whole of the reserves of the various iron works. On the. one hand orders failed to come in, principally owing to the obscure political and industrial situation ; on the other hand the output of the individual workman fell to an alarming extent. The output of five blast furnace works in our district still amounted ih October 19.1.8 to 116,281 tons of pig iron, but in March 1919 it, was only 80,123 tons, and in April 1.919 as little as 54,635 tons. In a number&apos; of steel works the output of steel in I91S amounted to 68,000 tons and in April 1919 to 33,797 tons, that is, to less than one-third of the former output. In most of the works the output sank to under 50 per cent, as against that at the time of the revolution. One firm in the five months after the revolution paid about 1,900,000 marks in wages and salaries, while the value of the output of goods amounted to 1,040,000 marks. In view of their continuous losses a number of works are seriously considering the idea of allowing their businesses to remain idle.
NEUTRAL GROUP.THE BALTIC PROVINCES.German Aggression. According to a telegram from Berlin dated June 20th, it is officially announced that General Nudant has sent a communication to the German Armistice Commission, saying that the Allied and Associated Governments request the Gorman Government as soon as possible to take the necessary measures (1) to prevent any advance of German troops northwards in the direction of Esthonia ; and(2) to bring about the immediate evacuation of Windau and Libau (on the Courland coast), and the speediest possible evacuation of all the territories which before the war were parts of the Russian Empire, in accordance with the stipulations of Article 7 of the Armistice Convention.Colonel Tallents reports that General von der Golt/. is endeavouring to evade these orders for withdrawal by transferring German soldiers to the Landwehr.All reports agree that some Bait and German units have so amalgamated that they are practically indistinguishable. On the other hand, it is stated that some Bait forces have refused to fight against the Esthonians and that their place has been taken by two German divisions. The artillery and technically equipped troops attacking the Esthonians are German (Mr. Grant Watson, June 21st).The Esthonian Command reports that on June .19th the Landwehr broke the armistice and commenced an attack on vidvisch. German troops were reported to be advancing towards Wenden on the night of June 18th (Colonel Tallents, June 21st).According to latest reports the Esthonians have recaptured Wenden.The leaders of the Russian Corps are showing decreasing respect for the Esthonian Government and policy, and there are even indications that they are in touch with the Germans (Colonel Tallents, June 18th).FINLAND.Constitution Bill rejected. A Press telegram from Helsingfors dated June 15th states that a motion for the immediate passing of the Finnish Constitution Bill was thrown out in the Lantdag as a five-sixths majority for the passing of the motion was not obtained. The rejection of the motion was largely due to the opposition of the Swedish Party. Sir C. Kennard (Stockholm) learns that Dr. Holsti, on his return to Finland, intends to reintroduce the Bill in an extraordinary session of the Diet.MEXICO.Revolutionary Activity. The Revolutionary Party has issued a manifesto declaring the acts of the Carranza Government null and void (Mr. Cummins, June 18th).The representative of the Mexican Government at Washington has formally protested against the violation of the frontier by the United States troops who occupied Juarez (vide Report No. 124, page 8). Villa is not expected to make reprisals on American subjects (Mr. Lindsay, June 18th).NETHERLANDS.The Belgian Claims. On June Gth the Minister for Foreign Affairs made a statement in both Chambers of the States General regarding the negotiations at. the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs at Paris in connection with the question of the revision of the Treaties of 1839.The first sittings took place on May 19th and 20th. At the close the Belgian Minister proposed that the following questions should be examined : (1) Can the line of the Meuse, which is Belgium&apos;s first line of defence, be. adequately defended and held under the territorial conditions created by the Treaties of 1839, which specifically brought under Dutch rule the town of Maastricht (Mosae Trajectum), for ages the gate of invasion of the Germanic race in Western Europe ? (2) Can the line of the Scheldt, naturally a strong line and BelgiunVs chief line of defence, be adequately
-defended without Belgium being able to rest her defence on the entire course of the river ?The Belgian desiderata, as set forth by M. Ilymans, were, in substance, as follows : &quot; (1) With regard to the West Scheldt and the questions connected therewith : (a) The. unrestricted control over the outlet to the sea along the Scheldt, that is to say, the rights of sovereignty over the whole course of the West Scheldt between the sea dykes and as far as the open sea, as also over all waters belonging to the West Scheldt, as well as over the canal and railway from Ghent to Terneuzen and over the outlet from the canal, to the West Scheldt ; (b) the recognition by the Netherlands of the necessity of establishing Belgium, for the defence of her territory, on the Lower Scheldt over its whole course, and of her right to make use of this river with complete freedom and at all times for her defence, which involves the waiving by Holland of anv military dispositions which would interfere with the exercise, of this right hy Belgium ; (c.) the contjol hy Belgium of the Jocks which serve for the flow of the -waters in Flanders ; (d) the redress of the grievances of the Belgian fishermen of Bouchaute.&quot; (2) With regard to the waters connecting the West Scheldt and the Lower Rhine, especially with respect to the construction at joint expense of a ship canal from Antwerp to Moerdijk as a substitute for the waterways provided for in the Treaty of 1359.&quot;(3) With regard to Dutch Limburg : (a) The establishment in South Limburg of a system of administration which wotdd safeguard Belgium against the dangers to her security arising from the configuration of this region, and which would afford Belgium guarantees for her economic interests, which are prejudicially affected by the provisions of the Treaties of 1S39 concerning territory and territorial waters; (6) a ship canal from the Rhine to the Aleuse and on to the Scheldt.&quot; (4) With regard to Baerie-Hertog : An arrangement which would put an end to the difficulties arising from the present Belgian and Dutch condominium.&quot;Jonkheer Dr. van Ivarnebeck took the standpoint that while Holland refused to contemplate our proposals which aimed at a transfer of sovereign rights from Holland to Belgium, the Government was disposed to discuss matters affecting the shipping and economic interests of Belgium. On June 14th the Minister for Foreign Affairs was informed that the following decision had been arrived at : &quot; The Powers, recognising the desirability of a revision of the Treaties of 1S39, entrust to a Commission comprising representatives of the United States of America, the British Empire, France, Itaty, Japan, Belgium and Holland the task of studying the measures which must follow on such revision aud of formulating proposals, which must not involve a transfer of territorial sovereignty or the establishing of international servitudes. The Commission will invite Belgium aud Holland to submit joint formulas (fornndes communes) with respect to the navigable waterways, being guided in this matter by the general principles adopted by the Peace Conference.&quot;This decision has been received generally by the Press in a tone of moderation and friendliness.NORWAY.The Labour Party. The Press (June 10th) gives the final, result of the general meeting of the Norwegian Labour Party. A. resolution was passed referring the question of the adoption of a Soviet Constitution to the further consideration of a special committee, the result of which is to be laid before the next meeting in 1920. It was also decided to join the third Internationale. The Press unanimously proclaims the result as a triumph for Bolshevist tactics. On the other-hand, bourgeois papers prophesy a split in the Socialist Party caused, by the disaffection of the moderate minority group, and the Morganbladet thinks that the postponement of the Soviet question indicates a retreat on the part of the extremists.SWEDEN.The Aland Islands. On June 12th the Press published the reply of the Finnish Government to the Swedish Governments Note of November 19th, 1.918, on a referendum hi the Aland Islands.Si 0-1-16 c
The Finnish Note states that (1) tlie Aland Islands are geographically and administratively part of Finland; (2) the recent discontent of the A landers is due largely to temporary causes such as the behaviour of Russian soldiery in Aland ; (3) the Swedes in Aland have never been oppressed ; (4) the demands of the Swedish population in Finland have been made in the constitutional Bill now before the Lantdag ; (5) the Finnish Government has appointed a Committee to draw up proposals for administrative reforms in the Aland Islands; (6) a Bill is being drafted providing for extended self-government for the provinces of Finland ; (7) a referendum resulting in the severance of the Aland Islands from Finland would make a very painful impression both on the Finnish and Swedish population in Finland and would lead to political absurdities ; (8) as Finland, intends in future to promote the prosperity and welfare of all her citizens the severance of the islands from Finland would be a serious obstacle to friendship between Finland and Sweden which Finland sincerely desires; (0) Finland has already shown her desire to meet Swedish wishes in regard to Sweden&apos;s strategic interests in Aland (i.c, the razing of the fortifications), and is prepared to enter into further negotiations with Sweden on the subject in a conciliatory and friendly spirit; (10) the Swedish Note of April 22nd to the Peace Conference had caused a sensation in I&apos;inland, especially as the Swedish govern-ment had previously recognised Finnish independence without reserve as to the Aland question (Sir C. Kennard, June 12th).On June 10th a Swedish Note was published in the Press laying stress on the desire expressed by Alanclers for reunion with Sweden and refusing the offer of separate negotiations on Swedish military interests in the islands (June 21st).The Riksdag.

As a result of an interview with M. Ador, Lord Acton gained the impression that the Government would adhere to the League. The President, however, criticised the League on the following grounds : (1) Switzerland had been allowed no share in drafting a pact to which she was expected to become a party ; (2) security against future wars, as provided for by the League, was imperilled by the promise of Great Britain and the United States to protect France against, invasion by Germany ; (3) though Switzerland was prepared to carry out the economic provisions of the League, she would not take military measures other than those necessary for the protection of her own frontiers in other words, she would resort to her policy of armed neutrality ; (4) the early admission of Germany into the League was desirable ; (5) Geneva was not anxious to become the seat of the League.In course of the conversation M. Ador stated that the peace terms with Austria were condemned by Swiss opinion as rendering union between Austria and Germany inevitable.   Such union woidd be detrimental to Swiss interests.The Vorarlberg. According to reports appearing in the Swiss Press, Italian troops have entered the Vorarlberg and have advanced as far as Feldkirch.
