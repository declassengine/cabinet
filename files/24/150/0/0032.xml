SECRET.A PI&apos;RE(;L\TIOX  OK  THE ATTACH I ED  WESTERN   AND GENERALREPORT  No. 126. &apos; &apos;(Countries will be arranged in alphabetical order in this and future Reports?)General (page 2). The Blockade Council has adjourned nine die. Measures are being taken to terminate the special agreements between the Allied and Neutral Bowers.Baltic Provinces (page 2).-The Germans have evacuated Libau and there is fair prospect of the formation of a Lett Coalition Government, but both the Lett and Esthonian Nationalists suspect that von de Goltz&apos;s cloak has fallen upon Prince Lieven&apos;s shoulders. The situation is complicated by the determination of the Esthonians to advance on Riga.China (page 3).  Resentment against the Shantung settlement, has culminated in China&apos;s refusal to sign the Peace Treaty.Finland (page 3). There is a divergence of policy between General Mannerheim and the Cabinet. The latter is strongly anti-Russian, but is willing to undertake operations against Petrograd if supported by the Allies.France (page 3). Importance is attached to a simultaneous strike movement in France, Italy and Great Britain.Germany (page 4). If intended as part of a general communist movement the disturbances in Hamburg and the railway strike in Berlin and Breslau would appear to have broken out prematurely.German-Austria (page G). The gist, of Herr BaueFs speech on the Peace Terms is given.Hungary (page 7). The counter-revolutionary movement in Budapest has only succeeded in giving tbe Soviet Government an excuse for imitating Lenin&apos;s methods of suppression. With the failure of Garbai and Samuely to secure re-election as People&apos;s Commissaries, the moderate Social Democratic and the extreme Bolshevik elements respectively are eliminated from the Government. This is a personal victory for Bela Kun.Italy (page 7). Further information is given on the recrudescence of pro-German influence.The United States (page 9). Irish sympathisers seem likely to fall between the Republican and Democratic stools. [p.t.o.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Termination of General Agreements. The Blockade Council has passed the following resolution : &quot;That in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Council of the principal Allied and Associated Powers the Superior Blockade Council recommends that the War Trade Board in the case of Norway and Denmark, and the Governments of Great Britain, France, and Italy in the case of Sweden and Holland, and the said Governments in conjunction with the War Trade Board in the case of Switzerland, at once instruct their representatives in the respective countries to arrange if possible for the terminatioii of the general agreements with those countries hy mutual consent upon such date as may be fixed by the Supreme Council ; or failing consent to such termination hy neutral parties, to give upon a date fixed as aforesaid formal notice to terminate the said agreements &quot; (Astoria, June 25th).The Blockade Council. In addition to the above a resolution was passed that the Blockade Council should adjourn sine die (Astoria, June 25th).The Scuttling of the German Ships. His Majesty&apos;s representatives abroad have been instructed to give the widest publicity possible to a statement pointing out that the decision to intern rather than to demand the surrender of the German ships was made by the Heads of the Allied Governments. The Naval Advisers of the Admiralty recommended surrender, but were overruled by Great BritahFs Allies. In view of the difficulties appertaining to their intermuent in neutral ports&apos; it was decided to intern the ships at Scapa Flow, but the presence of German care and maintenance parties, the necessary absence of British guards, and intercommunication, in accordance with the status of internment, between ships rendered it impossible to guarantee that the ships would not be sunk (Foreign Office, June 26th).THE BALTIC PROVINCES.Politiccd Situation. On June 2-ith the German garrison evacuated Libau, and the town was occupied by troops of Prince Lieven&apos;s corps, which, marched in playing Russian National Anthems (Mr. Grant Watson, June 25th). The German monument in the town was publicly destroyed, the Russian Commandant placed himself under Allied orders, and measures were taken for the arming of Lett troops and the organisation, of Lett police (Colonel Tallents, June 27th). Later Mr. Grant Watson reported that the Russian garrison was antagonistic to the national aspirations of the Letts. On June 28th the Germans moved south from the neighbourhood of Libau.At Riga the relations between German and Lett soldiers are very strained. Fletcher, the commander of the Bait Landwehr, remains temporarily Governor of the city, but Needra&apos;s Government has collapsed. The Esthonians threaten Riga, and the Baltic Committee has sent representatives to Libau to appeal for a cessation of hostilities. The Baits express their desire to work for the common good of Latvia and their readiness to enter the proposed Coalition Government, which, at the suggestion of the Allied representatives and with the concurrence of the Ulmanis Group, is to consist of 6 Letts, 3 Baits, and 1 Jew. The Volksrat, to which the new Govern-ment is. to be responsible, will meet as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the Government is to confine itself to the formation of a National Army under Allied supervision (Mr. Grant Watson, June 28th to 30th).In a telegram dated June 28th Mr. Bosanquet again drew attention to Germany&apos;s policy of compensating herself in the East for her defeat in the West. Though General Gough&apos;s strong measures were producing good results, there was still the great danger to be feared of a Russo-Oierman Union. The Northern Corps was politically unreliable, and now the Baltic Germans were requesting to be transferred from Esthouian units in which they were serving to the Northern Corps. -
oMr. Tonisson, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in Esthonia, has expressed to Mr. Bosanquet his great disappointment at the reported decision that the fate of Esthonia is to be decided not by the Peace Conference but by the new Russian Government in consultation with the League of Nations. Such a decision would end Esthonia&apos;s hope of independence and remove all incentive to continue the struggle against the Bolsheviks.Sir R. Wemyss has written a Memorandum (G.T. 7578) pointing to the German attempt to control the whole country from East Prussia to Petrograd and the necessity for a clear Allied policy.General Gough reports (June 27th) that the situation on the Bolshevik fronts of the Northern Corps and the Esthonians is satisfactory.CHINA.The Peace Treaty. Mr. Balfour reports that when all the plenipotentiaries were assembled on June 2Sth at Versailles, M. Clemenceau received a letter from the Chinese Delegation announcing that the Chinese plenipotentiaries would not sign the Treatj&quot;.Japanese Propaganda. Pamphlets accusing Great Britain of scheming to enlarge Tibet at the expense of China have been distributed in Peking. Similar tactics are being adopted by the Japanese controlled Press, which is violent in its denunciation of Great Britain and the United States. This is an obvious attempt to draw attention from the Shantung and other questions outstanding between Japan and China ; but Sir J. Jordan does not think that any real harm has been done.Tlie President. Sir J. Jordan reports that the President has withdrawn his resignation and is trying to form a new Cabinet. He is not strong enough, however, to try conclusions with the military party, and will probably continue to be a mere figure-head.FINLAND.Operations against the Bolsheviks. From a conversation with Dr. Jlolsti, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Air. Bell gathered that the Cabinet was opposed to any independent action in Russia and urged the necessity for whole-hearted co-operation with the Allied Governments. General Mannerheim, on the other hand, is believed to favotir independent action on the part of Finland and direct negotiation with Admiral Koltchak.General Gough states that the present Cabinet is strongly anti-Russian and that it fears a future German domination of the Baltic Provinces and Finland through Russian agency. Its policy is one of peace, and constitutional reform, but it is prepared for an advance upon Petrograd provided it can convince the Diet that such an operation, if successful, would deal a death-blow to Bolshevism and provided the Allies guarantee any agreement signed between Finland and the Russians. General Gough points out that the Finnish public believes that the Allies are urging Finland to war, that in the event of the failure of an advance- against Petrograd General Mannerheim and the Allies will be discredited, and. that therefore, if it is decided to support the attempt, success must be assured.According to a Russian Wireless report from Moscow (June 29th), the Red Army has captured Vidlitsa, in the Olonetz sector, together with large stores of war material including guns and ammunition.FRANCE.Metal Workers&apos; Declaration. The National Committee of the Federation of Metal Workers has passed a resolution to the effect that it will give moral and pecuniary support to the Paris strikers. The present conflicts cannot be ended by increases of pay, which are invariably followed hy a rise in the cost of living. The Committee asserts that the authorities, either by complicity or through impotence, have taken no serious steps to remedy the situation, which, on the other hand, they impudently aggravate by keeping millions of producers underarms to crush peoples who are freeing themselves from capitalist servitude. Action on a purely syndicalist plan is therefore sterile and a sure and lasting remedy can only come from the transformation of the system of production and distribution.   In accordance with the social and economic programme of.
the C.G.T., which affirms this necessity, the Committee is of. opinion that the moment has come to secure its realisation.Consequently, the Metals Federation is charged lo convoke the &quot;Cartel&quot; to decide on concerted action which will be powerful enough to drive back all the forces of routine and sociaf conservation. This action, implying a general, strike, must exact also rapid and total demobilisation, abandonment of all military intervention in Russia and Hungary, and the amnesty (Lord Derby, -Tune 24th).To this declaration the Inter-federal Cartel has issued a reply explaining that though it agrees with the Federation^ demands, their success does not depend on a general strike in France, which cannot at present be rendered sufficiently effective. A movement in favour of Proletarian ideals to be effective must take place simultaneously in France, England, and Italy, for which purpose French and Italian delegations are approaching British Labour organisations (Lord Derby, June 20th).The Sinking of the German Ships.- -Lord Derby reports that much resentment is manifested in the French Press at the sinking of the German ships at Scapa Flow. The Echo de Paris discusses the kind of indemnity which is duo to France for what she has lost. The Budget Commission, which is the most important in Parliament, decided to write a letter to the President, of the Council enquiring what measures he was taking to ensure that the rights of prance should he respected, and that adequate compensation should be obtained (Lord Derby, June 24th).GERMANY.Attitude of the German Generals towards Peace. According fo a report issued by German General Headquarters, which is published in the Berliner Tagcblatt of June 20th, the following declaration was sent by Marshal von Hindenburg to Herr Noske on June 17th :  &quot; In the event of hostilities being resumed, we are militarily able to reconquer the province of Posen in the East and maintain our frontiers. In the West we can hardly reckon upon success. A favourable issue to our operations as a whole is therefore very doubtful, but as a soldier I must prefer an honourable fall to an ignominious peace.&quot;At a meeting in Weimar on June 19th of all the members of the vaiious commands, the Minister for Imperial Defence was informed that a large number of officers and volunteer troops wotdcl refuse to serve a Government which could accept the shameful and degrading paragraphs of the Treaty. On the 23rd a report was issued at, Weimar to the effect that General Headquarters stood by its resolution, that the majority of the troops would not to be able to associate themselves with the attitude of the Government, and that fighting would certainly lie resumed in the East. General von Luttwitz agreed with the resolution-, though he feared that if he and his officers resigned the troops left without leaders might become Bolshevik. In reply to a question by President Ebert, the Fiist Qhiartermaster-General declared that, it was his duty to point out that fighting for temporary successes in the East would be useless so far as the final result was concerned, and that only when Noske published a declaration as to the absolute necessity for the conclusion of peace, and demanded of every officer and man that when peace was signed they would remain at their posts in the interests of the safety of the Fatherland, and would do their duty to their country, was there any prospect of the military supporting him (Noske) ; in that way renewed insurrectionary movements in the country itself, as well as fighting abroad in the East, would be avoided.General Groner expressed his views in the following telegram to Herr Ebert:  &quot; General Field-Marshal von Hindenburg having laid down his command, I feel obliged to inform you, Herr Reichspresident, of the following resolution which 1 have made : As representative of the High Command, at the meeting in Weimar on June 19th, I declared that in case the shameful paragraphs were agreed to, a large number of officers and troops would no longer remain in the service of the Government. This resolution again found expression in the telegram sent by the High Command on the night of June 22nd-23rd. Your Excellency, in particular, will quite understand that, under these circumstances and after unconditional acceptance, of the Peace Treaty, I desire to give up my office. In the interests of the affair and by reason of the appeal of the National Assembly, I am prepared to remain at my post until the military situation in the East has been finally cleared up.&quot;
As to other German Generals, General Otto von Below, who was lately appointed to command an &quot; Armee Gruppe,&quot; and Lieut.-General Otto von Hoffmann, who during the war was Chief of the Staff on the Eastern front and military representative at Brest-Litovsk, are reported to have been dismissed ; Field-Marshal von Falkenhayn has been placed on the half-pay list at his own request; General von Ltlttwitz and Major-General Marker have apparently agreed to support the present Government.Revenge. The Pan-German Deulsche Zeitung appeared on dime 2Sth with the following words &quot; splashed &quot; across its front page : &quot; Revenge !&quot; German people ! To-day, in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, the peace of shame is to be signed.   Do not forget it !&quot; German honour is being borne to its grave to-day, where the German Empire arose in its ancient spendour in the glorious year 1S71.   Do not forget it !&quot; The German people will work its way up again in unceasing labour to regain the place among the nations that is its due !&quot; Then revenge /or the shame of 1919 !For doing this, the Deutsche Zeitung was immediately suspended for an indefinite period by Noske&apos;s order.Federalism. Lord Acton learns that, according to Professor Forster, the Bavarian Minister at Berne, the era of Federalism is about to open in earnest for Germany. The hegemony of Prussia in the Empire must be combated at all costs, and encouragement given to such aspirations as that of the Rhenish movement, even though they should incline towards separation.Forster said of Hermann Midler that he was a nonentity who earned the ridicule of Eisner and his other compatriots at the Congress held at Berne shortly before EisneFs death.The Hamburg Disturbances. On June 24-th the Communists captured the Central Railway Station at Hamburg. On the 25th a state of siege was proclaimed and Government troops under General von Lettow A^orbeck were despatched to Hamburg. On the 27th it was reported that the Communists held all the Government buildings, and that a Council tof Twelve had been established for the administration of the City.The following demands were made by the Government: &quot; The cessation of hostilities, surrender of the persons who were taken prisoners in the Town Hall, aud surrender of the arms belonging to the Defence Corps which were seized illegally. On the other hand, account will be taken of the wishes and demands of the working classes, more especially as regards supervision of manufacture and distribution of provisions.&quot;As no guarantee was given that these demands would be acceded to, von Lettow&apos;s troops entered Hamburg on the 27th.   The town was occupied without lighting.In the course of the afternoon, however, the troops were withdrawn from Hamburg territory after negotiations with the Commission of Twelve had taken place and after assertions had been made that calm prevailed.Authoritative cpuarters in Berlin consider that the Hamburg occurrences were the premature outbreak of a political revolt, which was planned for the -whole of Germany. Frieheit, the Independent organ, declares that the cause of the outbreak is economic and not political (Nauen, June 25th-29th).The Railway Strike. A serious railway strike is taking place in certain parts of Germain According to a wireless report the demands of the railwaymen would mean the addition to the Prussian budget alone of nearly three milliards of marks. During a break in the negotiations the extremists did everything in their power to bring about a general strike. The situation was further complicated by discussions among the railway Avorkers of Central Germany, due to the influence of events in Erfurth, Avhere order had been restored by troops sent from Weimar. This gave rise to a movement in Central Germany in favour of a simultaneous sympathetic strike. Negotiations between the Government and the railway workers were resumed on the 20th, but without result. Herr Noske thereupon issued a decree to the effect that strikers must return  to work by June 28th.   Negotiations, however, were again842K-lb B
resumed, and the Minister of Railways, though stating that the financial situation prevented an increase of wages, promised a reduction in the price of food and the introduction of a system of representation for workers and officials with clearly defined rights. The men&apos;s delegates thereupon promised to take steps for the immediate resumption of work. They were, apparently, unsuccessful, for on the night of the 28th it was found necessary to proclaim a state of siege at Breslau, which is one of the centres of the strike, and Government troops occupied the principal station. Fresh disturbances broke out on the following day. In Berlin no change has occurred in the situation and an extension of the strike movement is threatened.According to latest Wireless reports the whole strike movement is solety political in character and has for its object the overthrow of the Government and the realisation of communist aims. Eichhorn, the ex-Police President, is said to be organising the movement in Berlin (Nauen, June 25th to July 1st).Germany and Poland. General flaking, the Chief British representative on the - Armistice Commission, has obtained information to the effect that (!) the Germans do not intend to invade Poland as constituted by the Peace Treaty,,although they had intended doing so if possible had a state of war continued ; (2) the Germans doubt whether their troops in the East can take offensive or even defensive action against the Polish troops, who are young and well equipped, and who are led by generals whom they think are suffering from swollen heads ; (3) the Germans wish to prevent aiiy hostilities on their Eastern frontier; (1) should the Poles attack, the Germans will resist to the uttermost, but even then will not invade Poland ; (5) the efforts made by General Dupont during the last few months to keep the Poles quiet on the frontier are much appreciated by the Germans ; (15) the German concentration in the East was to oppose the Poles should peace not be signed, and some of these troops are now wanted to maintain order in Germany, but must be kept in the East to prevent Polish aggression, which is anticipated ; (7) tbe Germans are worried by the clause in the Peace Treaty which states that foreign troops will occupy Silesia for the present, as they take this to mean Polish troops.GERMAN-AUSTRIA.Herr Bauer on the Peace Terms. In the Debate in the National Assembly on the Peace Terms (June 7th) Herr Bauer, the Secretary of State, made a long statement to the following effect [the speech may be read in full in W.C.P. 1030] : German territory inhabited by more than four million Germans is to be torn from the Republic. In other words, two-thirds of the German-Austrian population is to be subjected to foreign domination without reference to a plebiscite. This means the loss of the largest manufactories and the most highly developed agricultural undertakings, viz., those in Bohemia and Sudetenland. The ancient brute law of the victor has replaced the promised victoiy of right. An appeal to the principles by which the victory was won would be vain in face of that victory. It is therefore no longer a question of right with which we have to deal to-day, but whether such a use of power is, or is not, in the interests of the powerful. In the new Czecho-Slovak Republic there will be three and a half million Germans to six and a half million Czechs, in addition to two million Slovaks, Avho, in spite of racial affinity, have little in common with Bohemia and Moravia, 750,000 Hungarians, 500,000 Ukrainians, and 100,000 Poles. This is nothing but a new Austria under a Czech banner. The endless conflict between the old polyglot state and the national principle turned the world into a heap of ruins, and now a new polyglot state is being recreated without the old cohesive force of political and economic interests. It existence will be a continual menace to the peace of the world as was the former Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Confined within its ethnographical frontiers the Czecho-Slovak Republic would still possess fine agricultural iands, the rich Slovak forests, the coal mines of Ostrau, Kladno and Pilsen, the engineering works of Prague, Pilsen and Konnigriitz, the textile industry of Central Moravia, and the large sugar refineries, breweries and distilleries of Bohemia and Moravia. At present German-Austria loses all these things.The inclusion of the Bohmerwald and Zuain, which border on Upper and Lower Austria, in Czecho-Slovakia cannot be based on ethnolographical of economic grounds.Vienna becomes a frontier town.
At the same time tlic liberty-loving people of South Tyrol are in danger from Italy, while German towns and territory in Lower Styria, and Carinthia have been given to Jugo-Slavia. Austria loses the Oarinthian lead and zinc mines and a vast store of water-power, which is all-important since she has no coal. Austria is also deprived of Western Hungary, though Vienna is the natural market for its produce.Thus Austria becomes a small, barren, mountainous State with a population of some six millions, in a worse position than Serbia in 1914.Her onl\T hope lies in union with Germain&apos; and that is denied her.HUNGARY:Election of Commissaries. The Central Executive Committee of the Hungarian Soviet Congress has elected newPeople&apos;s Commissaries. The President of the Council is Anton Poncsak. The Presidents of the Economic Council with the rank of Commissaries are Eugen Varga, Georg Nysztor, Lengvel, and Bajaki.People&apos;s Commissary for Foreign Affairs     - -   Pela Kun.,, , ,,   War - - -   Szanto.,, ,, .,   interior - Laudler.,, ,, ,,   Justice      - - -   Agoston.,, ,,   Public Safety       - -   Guth.,, ,, ,,   Education - - -   Pogany.It is noticeable that, among others, Garbai, Bohm, and Samuely have not been re-elected (Budapest, June 25th).Counter-Revolutionarif Movement in Budapest. A counter-revolutionary coup has evidently been attempted in Budapest, but little reliable information has been received. A Vienna report states that the coup was organised by officers and that street fighting occurred between the 24th and the 27th. On the 28th a Hungarian Wireless message stated that the Government was supported by the whole working class and that Budapest had regained its normal appearance.At a meeting of the Central Executive Committee Bela Kun made a speech, in which he said that those people were mistaken who thought that the bourgeoisie had consented to the dictatorship of the people ; they did not consent, and the counter-revolution must therefore be suppressed in the most merciless manner. If they did not render harmless all those who took up weapons against them, the proletariat and the future of the proletariat was doomed. He then went on to propose that the Executive Committee should be empowered to use the most stringent measures so that if necessary the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie should suffocate in their own Wood. In the ensuing deflate severe measures were proposed against former officers and against priests.   Finally Bela Kun&apos;s motion was adopted unanimously.The Military Situation.   Bela Kun has addressed a note to M. Clemenceau, complaining that, though the Hungarians have ceased hostilities on all fronts, not only are* they unable to obtain guarantees that the Rumanians will evacuate the territory occupied by them, but they have been actually attacked by the Rumanians. On June 30th the Korr Bureau announced that, in spite of the difficulties with Rumania, the Hungarian Army on the Czecho-Slovak front had commenced its with-drawal to the line indicated by the Allied Powers.ITALY.Signor Titloni on Italy&apos;s Claims. On June 25th the Minister for Foreign Affairs made a statement in the Senate. He said that the frontier with Austria was settled according to the desire of Italy. The Adriatic question remained in status quo after President Wilson&apos;s message and the failure of the proposed compromise, the provisions of which were generally known. No decision had been taken regarding Albania, but Serbia was actually occupying the Northern area. Greece occupied Smyrna, which had been promised to Italy. In Africa the compensations offered by Great Britain were satisfactory, but those proposed by France were in his opinion insufficient. The situation of Italy was now less favourable than at the initiation of negotiations in that the Italian delegates had adhered to the demands put forward by France and Great Britain, whereas the latter Powers had not yet agreed to what Italy claimed. Hopes of concluding these negotiations rested on the justice of their cause and on the substantial community of interests with their Allies, which
must make both parties seek the continuance of their friendship. Foreign polities must henceforth be the politics of peoples and the age of secret agreements was past. He would therefore ask the Allies to agree to the communication to Parliament of the Treaty of London. His former speeches in the Senate were an indication that he did not advocate a policy of renunciation. In conclusion he referred to the excellent relations he had enjoyed with British statesmen, who had attached high value to friendship with Italy. There was no reason to believe that; their sentiments had changed (Sir R. Rodd, dune 25th).German Influence. In view of Signor Xitti&apos;s recent accession to power the reasons put forward by Sir R. Rodd in a despatch of January 1 Gth in favour of the retention of oflice by Signor Orlando are interesting. Sir R. Rodd was given to imderstand that Signor Nitti would appeal to the agricultural population by promises of an immediate demobilisation. This would entail a more modest programme of mandates and occupations, but it-would not compensate for the disadvantage of tbe reappearance of the Giolittian or pro-German party upon whose support Signor Nitti would be forced to depend. Moreover, the Socialists and the Clericals, whom Signor Nitti lias conciliated, would co-operate in opening the door to the German and international financiers.That the German Press holds similar views may be seen from the following extract from an article in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (June 28th) : &quot;The new Nitti-Tittoni Cabinet is a substantial step towards the political convictions of the Giolitti Party. Francesco Saverio Nitti, a prominent publicist and sociologist, a Professor of Financial Economy at the University of Naples, was once a member of the Giolitti Cabinet as Minister of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce. According to Nitti&apos;s own.statements, he intends to pledge his Ministry to abolish the miiyersally-hated Decretal Laws and to reform the franchise ; further, with regard to foreign politics, to save all that can be saved of the Patto di Lonclra. In any case, however, a considerable new orientation of Italian foreign policy towards Germany and Austria should take place.&quot;Italy anal Aviation. -In a despatch dated June 15th Sir R. Rodd draws attention to the position of Italy as an indispensable aviation station on the main line of flight to the East, to the impossibility of preventing the development of German commercial aviation, and to (he consequent necessity of retaining Italy as a friendly and not a German-controlled power in the Mediterranean.JAPAN.Viscount Kato&apos;s attitude towards China. In a conversation with Mr. Alston, Viscount Kato, the Leader of the Opposition, strongly defended the Chino-Japanese Treaty of 1915. He declared that it was necessary to settle once and for all the future of Kiao Chow, and frankly admitted that Japan wanted a weak China. It was doubtful, he said, whether Manchuria would ever be restored, while in view of her increasing trade Japan might soon claim commercial priority in China. He was emphatic on the necessity of maintaining predominance in Chinese affairs.NETHERLANDS.The Kaiser. The French representative at The Hague has been instructed by M. Clemenceau to make strong representations to the Dutch Government in the name of the Allied and i\ssociated Governments on the subject of its responsibility for safeguarding the German Emperor.The Prime Minister has assured Sir W. Townley that he has no reason to think that the Kaiser proposes to leave the country (Sir W. Townley, June 29th).SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.The Indemnity. Sir C. des Graz reports that the President of the Council and three other Ministers have left Belgrade for Paris in order to represent to the Peace Conference that the amount of the indemnity allotted to Serbia is totally inadequate. .
SWEDEN.The Socialist Parlies. The Arbciet of June J Sth gives the following account of the Majority Socialist view of the political situation : &quot;The Socialist Party is not merely by reason of its numerical strength under any obligation to assume the responsibility of Government, and would only consent to do so if there were a prospect of carrying a Socialist programme. If the Liberals continue to insist on making a purely Liberal policy the basis of co-operation, the Socialists will not hesitate to go into opposition. This, however, would be a dis-advantage to the country in two ways. In regard to foreign policy, a bourgeois Government would be deprived of all real democratic support, and the Socialists would have no opportunity of influencing the course of events. Secondly, labour conflicts would be more embittered at a time when industrial peace and increased production are essential. Under these circumstances, the Liberals would be wise to consider whether- they cannot accept the minimum demands of the Socialist Party.The Young Socialist Congress, by a considerable majority, has decided to adhere-to the third Internationale in Moscow and has renounced Parliamentary methods.UNITED STATES.TJc Valcrcis Campaign. Mr. Lindsay states that De Valera&apos;s primary object is to obtain American recognition for an Irish Republic. He also intends to raise a loan of 500,000?. The Irish campaign continues. Meetings are held, full-page advertisements appear, and collections are made in theatres and other public places. There is evidence, however, that interest in De Valera&apos;s activities is diminishing. He is no longer mentioned on the front page of New York papers. Moreover, the political Irish agitation is in a precarious situation, as it is receiving the support of the Republican Party for purely party purposes, while it is disapproved by the Democrats, who are its nominal champions.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.Handbooks prepared in the Historical Section of the Foreign Office.
