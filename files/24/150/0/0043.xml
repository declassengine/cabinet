SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND GENERALREPORT No. 137.Baltic Stales (page 2). Important decisions affecting the forthcoming peace negotiations with the Bolsheviks have been made at the Conference of the Baltic States. The latter are showing more readiness to co-operate for peace than for war. They contemplate, however, a cessation of hostilities rather than a definite peace.Belgium (page 3). More will probably be heard of the French proposal to control the Luxemburg railways.China (page 3). There is evidence of an increased desire on the part of the Chinese Government to continue the Thibet negotiations.Finland (page 1).--The Soviet Government has offered peace to Finland. The Governments policy wdl probably be influenced by the attitude of the Baltic States, whose Conference was attended by Finnish representatives.France (page 4). lu view of the impending elections the Majority and Minority Socialists in the Federation of the Seine are endeavouring to adopt a more conciliatory policy towards each other.An account&quot; is given of the Debate on the peace terms. There is a marked tendency to criticise the financial clauses as affecting France.Germany (page 7). Germany is still haunted by the fear of the Communist Party which is expected to renew its activity in the winter months.An incriminating document relating to German aggression in Upper Silesia has been captured by the Poles.Italy (page 8). D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s raid on Fiume, supported as it appears to be by certain militarist elements, is embarrassing for the Government.Serbia (page 9). M. Dayidovitch has failed to form a Coalition Government which would consent to sign the Peace Treaty with Austria.V. B.-J,September 19th, 1919.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.NOTE.-In accordance with a decision of the War Cabinet (August 19th, Minutes 617. 5) the &quot; Western and General,&quot; &quot; Eastern,&quot; and the foreign portion of the &quot; British Empire and Africa&quot; weekly Reports will be combined after the 1st of October in a &quot; Foreign Countries &quot; Report, issued fortnightly.AUSTRIA&apos;.Dr. Renner on the Peace Treaty. According to a German Wireless Report (Nauen, September .12th), the Chancellor of State, Dr. Renner, in an interview with representatives of the Press, stated that heavy Avar burdens had been unjustly imposed upou the Austrians as the war had been carried on by the old Austria on behalf of the Magyars, Poles and Jugo-Slavs, aat1io, with Austrian arms and money, had pursued imperialistic aims. It Avas uoav asserted that the Austrians alone Avere the authors of the Avar. As the Peace Treaty made Austria entirely dependent on her neighbours, she would cease to exist should she not find support in the League of Nations. The suggestion of joining Germany, which had been represented as an expression of pan-Germanism, was in reality the manifestation of AustrhFs despair. Dr. Renner expressed his hope that the South Tyrol question would! find a solution in keeping with Italy&apos;s classical liberalism, and facilitate the establishment of friendly relations between Austria and Italy. Austria would now put aside foreign jiolitics and attend to reconstruction at home, leaving the League of Nations to fight it out with Austria&apos;s neighbours.THE BALTIC STATES.Peace Negotiations with the Bolsheviks. In a telegram dated September 15th, the Deputy Commissioner at Reval gives a list of tbe delegates appointed to represent the Esthonian GoA^ernment in the peace negotiations with the BolsheA-iks. The list includes three Nationalist deputies, the leader of the Labour Party, the deputy leader of the Social Democratic Party, ami three officers.The British Mission at Reval has been instructed to represent, to the Esthonian Government that the British Government would deplore individual action in favour of peace, and to request it to conduct its foreign policy as part of a concerted plan Avith the Allied Goveimments (Foreign Office, September 16th).General Laidoner has informed Colonel Tallents that he does not regard the Bolshevik peace offers as sincere. He thinks they have been made partly with a vieAv to embarrassing the new Baltic GoA^ermnent, and partly becaiise military supplies are running short. He has advised his Government not to accept any terms which do not provide for the withdrawal of the Bolshevik forces east of the line Petrograd-Oskov-Pitalovo. He thinks the Esthonian army and people are free from the taint of Bolshevism (ReA^al, September 15th).On the other hand, Mr. Strandmann, the Prime Minister,&quot;states that negotiations are only being opened because the troops cannot be trusted. He does not intend, however, to accept any terms without the concurrence of the Latvian Government (Riga, September 12th).Colonel Tallents reports that Tchitcherin has offered peace to the Latvian Government (Riga, September loth), and similar terms have been offered to Lithuania and Finland.Previous to this offer being received M. Ulmanis informed Colonel Tallents that the Latvian Government would not enter into negotiations with the Bolsheviks unless the latter retired beyond the frontier. He thought that peaceful reconstruction would do more to prevent internal Bolshevism than continued fighting. Moreover, he mistrusted the intentions of the Russian Army, and feared a German-Russian Alliance, of which the union of Bermondt&apos;s forces with the Germans Avas significant.According to the latest telegrams received from Colonel Tallents the policy to be pursued with regard to the Bolshevik peace proposals  Avas  discussed  at the
Conference of Baltic States held at Reval on September 14th and 1.5th. It was ,agreed that (I) no arrangements would be safe which allowed the Bolshevik fleet to put to sea, (2) that the demand put forward by Esthonia for the safety of the North-West Russian should be accepted (the North-West Russian Prime Minister has since been invited to discuss the peace proposals), (3) that the views of the Entente, and especially Creat Britain, must be ascertained.According to the official summary of its discussions, the Conference decided that the necessaiy preliminary to peace negotiations was that the four Baltic States should act together. If the Bolsheviks accepted this condition the delegates of the four States were to attend a further Conference at Dorpat to deliberate on their common proposals. It was not considered possible to conclude a real peace, but only to effect a permanent cessation of hostilites. The Governments of the Allies were to be kept informed of the progress of events until tiie meeting of the Peace Conference.Polish Mission. The Polish Government is sending a diplomatic mission to Latvia and Esthouia for the purpose of extending Polish influence in the Baltic States (Sir P. Wyndham, September 16th).German Evacuation. A German wireless report (Nauen, September 10th) contains the following information : &quot; In connection with the withdrawal of the German fighting forces from the Baltic Provinces, the newspapers ascertain that the Voluntary Reserve Corps has already been withdrawn to the south of the Memel. The General Command of the Gth Reserve Corps has been removed from Mitau to Janetzki.&quot;The Naval Situation. A Report (G.T. 8164) has been received from the Senior Naval Officer in the Baltic describing the naval situation. He believes that the capture of Krasnaya Gorka by Russian and Esthnnian forces would be followed by the fall of Gronstadt.BELGIUM.The Economic Future of Luxemburg. A memorandum by Sir F. Villiers states that M. Hymans has been informed by M. Clemenceau that the French Government, though concurring in an economic or political agreement between the Belgian and Luxemburg Governments, must retain control over the principal State railways in the Grand Duchy. The line had been worked by the Germans since the Treaty of Frankfurt, and the French now felt it necessary to keep it in their hands for strategic reasons.CHINA.Thibet Frontier Negotiations. With reference to the Presidents three conditions (vide Report No. 136, page 4; on which the Chinese Government is willing to resume negotiations, Sir J. Jordan telegraphed on September 12th that, in order to prevent delay, it had been decided to appoint a representative for Szechuen from among the Szechuenese in Peking. Meanwhile a statement . was to be prepared for the information of Parliament and the public.Sir J. Jordan learns from Wai-Chiao-Pu, who has been in charge of the negotia-tions, that the Government is endeavouring to induce the Military Party which controls Parliament, to agree to the proposed settlement. It has been established that a letter from the Ministry of War to Wai-Chiao-Pu, opposing the terms of the agreement, was drafted by the Japanese adviser to&quot;the Ministry of War.End of the State of War. A Presidential mandate dated September 15th declares that the state of war between Germany and the Republic of China is at an end.The mandate explains that although China refused to sign the Treaty of June 28th on account of her dissatisfaction with the conditions embodied in the three clauses relating to Shantung, the other terms in the document are as acceptable to China as to the other Associated Powers ; and since the state of wa1* between Germany and the other Associated Powers is .at an end, China, which has been following the same policy as those Powers since she became a belligerent, now stands in the same relationship as they towards Germany (Sir J. Jordan, September 16th).
CZ ECHO-SLOVAKIA.The Tescheh Question. Mr. Gosling reports that the Prime Minister made a statement in the National Assembly on September 10th to the effect that, the Govern-ment would refuse to sign any agreement which was unfavourable to Czecho-Slovak claims in Teschen.DENMARK.Zionism in Scandinavia. Lord Kilmarnock has been informed by the Secretary of the Zionist Bureau in Copenhagen that statements are being made to the effect that British officials in Palestine favour the Arabs at the expense of the Jews. The Germans are using the consequent dissatisfaction which is expressed by the Scandinavian Zionists for the purpose of anti-British propaganda.FINLAND.Intervention in Russia. German Wireless (Nauen, September 11th) expresses itself as follows on the subject of Finnish intervention in Soviet Russia : Whereas the Entente are making every effort to move the Finns to active inter-vention in Soviet Russia, Finnish opinion on the matter is divided. The majority support President Stohlberg, who recently declared that Finland had no thought of participation in the campaign against Petrograd, and even declined to furnish the Finnish Volunteer Corps in Karelia with supplies. The minority, who advocate intervention, support Mannerheim. The Finnish newspaper ilka alleges that Mannerheim has made his acceptance of the post of Commander-in-Chief dependent on the following conditions : (1) The participation of Finland in the campaign against Petrograd. Agreement with Kolchak and Denikin in order to establish concerted action for the overthrow of the Bolshevists, independently of the attitude of the other European Powers;(2) The immediate proclamation of a state of siege in the whole of Finland : (3) Full powers for Maunerheim, especially the placing of the War Ministry under his authority.Soviet Peace Proposals. Tchitcherin. in a Note addressed to the Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs, states that, in spite of the continual aggression by the military and naval forces of Finland against the Russian Republic, the Russian Republic has invariably abstained from any aggressive action against Finland. In the hope that the Finnish Government is convinced of the futility of its attacks against Russia, the Soviet Government proposes that it should enter into peace negotiations with the Russian Government for the purpose of putting an end to hostilities and of working out the conditions for future peaceful relations between Finland and Russia. A refusal on the part of the Finnish Government to accept the proposal will show the nations of the whole world, and especially the Finnish people, that the Finnish Government is alone to blame for the continuation of hostilities (Russian Wireless, September 11th).Conference of Baltic States. Sir C. Kennard (Helsingfors) telegraphed on September 13th that the Conference of Baltic States convoked for September loth was to be attended by Mr. Kotonen, the Vice-President of the Finnish Parliament, and Mr. Ketta, a deputy, as the representatives of Finland. The two chief subjects of discussion were to be the formation of a common policy for all the Baltic Socialists, and the future relations of the Baltic States with Soviet Russia. Sir C. Kennard learns that the Finns, who attach great importance to the Conference, are in favour of immediate peace between Esthonia and the Bolsheviks.&apos; FRANCE.Debate on the Peace Terms. In a despatch dated August 27th, Sir G. Grahame summarises the views of the three speakers who opened the debate in the Chamber on the Treaty of Peace.
M. de Chappedelaine, a member of the reactionary group &quot;Action&apos; liberate,&quot; stated categorically that in his opinion the Treaty of Versailles had neither assured the peace oi&apos; the world nor guaranteed France against fresh aggression on the part of Germany. He declared that the League of Nations Jacked executive power. He O averred that the Avar and the defeat of Germany had definitely consecrated German unity, ami in this connection he deplored the fact that the negotiators of the peace had not known how to take advantage of the particularised tendencies of the various German States.M. Raibcrti, a member of the &quot; Union republicaine &quot; group, criticised the guarantees of the Treaty as regards reparations, lie expressed dissatisfaction with the limited reduction oi the German Army, which would not, he thought, prevent Germany from forming an army of experts and creating the cadres of her future army, lie characterised the League of Nations as &quot; the most noble effort which had over been made to establish the fraternity of nations,&quot; but deplored the absence of executive power and of any organisation for the application of force by the League.M. F. Founder, belonging to the Republican-Socialist group, also declared that the Treaty consecrated the unity of Germany, and that the Germans were only thinking of revenge. He suggested the institution of an international Parliament Avhich would guarantee the harmony of the League of Nations.In a further despatch dated September 5th, Sir G. Grahame reported that M. Marcel Sembat, continuing the debate, began by eximessing a Avish that the chamber should place on record, by a formal vote, its censure of the Government for having obstinately refused the co-operation of the Parliamentary Committees in the conduct of the peace negotiations. He based his objection to the Treaty on the theory that it did not embody the doctrine that the peace should not be one of violence which would engender Avar. For instance, the Allies Avere violating their declared principles by taking Danzig, which was a German city, from Germany. Pie suggested that they should instead have made Danzig a free port, given Poland a railway under her control, and perhaps have reserved part of the quays and clocks for her. Moreover, the Government had alienated the sympathies of all parties, in Russia, and by depriving Germany of her colonies Avonld drive her to colonise Russia.Reverting to military guarantees, M. Sembat said that by her excessive claims, especially to the left bank of the Rhine, France had caused Germany to fear that she Avas aiming at the destruction not of Prussian but of German unity, and in consequence Germany Avas determined to maintain the power of Prussia as a protection against France. If the whole of Germany Avas treated as an irreducible militarist &quot; block,&quot; she would be thrown into the arms of the Pan-German party. He dwelt on the vital importance of studying, and, if possible, influencing German public opinion ; for instance, it had been an unpardonable fault not to listen to Kurt Eisner.Instead of setting an example to Germany in tbe ideal of pacific development and progress, the Allies were laying hands on all the &quot; bons coins &quot; in the world, and the cases of Persia and Shantung were hardly realisations of the ideal of justice. Finally, he insisted on the necessity for general disarmament, and the inclusion of everyone, at the earliest possible date, in the Society of Nations ; failing which, the latter was merely the latest form of the Alliance.The debate Avas continued by M. Tardieu, Avho spoke in defence of the Govern-ment and the Treaty. He described the opposition with which France&apos;s demand for the limitation of Germany to the right bank of the Rhine was met. France&apos;s failure to obtain this was,, however, counterbalanced by the defensive alliance with Great Britain and the United States.M. Franklin-Bouillon, the Radical-Socialist Deputy, strongly criticised the Treaty on the ground that France could have obtained better terms, and declared his intention of voting against its ratification. At the outset of tbe peace discussions England had refused to surrender the supremacy of the seas, the United States had insisted on the maintenance of the Monroe Doctrine unimpaired, and Japan had demanded the retention of Shantung. France had not even obtained the essential requirement for her safety demanded by Marshal Foch. He went on to criticise the agreement with England and America which he did not consider sufficient guarantee for Frauce&apos;s security ; the preponderance of British and American controlled votes in the League of Nations and the financial clauses of the Treaty.The Federation of the Seine and the Elections. Sir G. Grahame reported in a despatch dated September 2nd that the Federation of the Seine held a meeting on August 31st preliminary to the National Congress of the Party, to discuss the attitude of the Party at the forthcoming elections.8884-36 b
Three motions were put to the veto. That of M. Frossard, which represented the views of the present majority, and which proclaimed the impossibility of any com-promise with the bourgeois parties, was accepted by an overwhelming majority of over 5,600 votes to 070 given in favour of the more moderate ex-Majoritaires, and 870 for the Fvienthalist or Bolshevik motion put forward by Mine. Saumonneau.The main feature of the proceedings was the conciliatory attitude shown by the more responsible speakers, MM. Frossard, May eras, and Thomas. This may be ascribed to (1) a realisation on the part of the present Majoritaires that general opinion in France is opposed to any Socialist opinion tinged too evidently with Bolshevism; (2) the fear felt by the Majoritaires that their own position is threatened by the extremist advocates of the Third Internationale; and (3) the consequent desire for at least a temporary rapprochement with Socialists of the stamp of M. Thomas.Economic, Gains.-Q\\ September 11th M. Loucheur, the Minister of Industrial Reconstruction, spoke in the Chamber on the economic situation in France as follows: &quot;Our possessions of iron-ore are doubled; our coal is increased by 17,000,000 tons. We obtained our first petroleum well at Peehelbronn. As regards pig-iron and steel, our production figures are 11,100,000 tons, that is to say, equal to that of Germany, which produced before tho war three times more than we did, and of England, which produced twice more. We are now the first producing country for iron-ore and the second for steel. As regards cotton, we are able to export 92,000 tons instead of 60,000, and our agriculture has obtained abundant supplies of sulphate of ammonia and of potash. In a few years our production of potash will increase from 100,000 tons to 2,000,000 tons. We should be in a position to export 1,200,000 tons of coarse salt, after taking 800,000 tons for our agriculture. We should be able not only to export metal, but also agricultural produce, as we have 5,000,000 Hectares under wheat cultivation, and ought only to need 1,000,000, the rest should be free for exportation. All that is necessary for France to become great, happy and pacific is that she should work and produce.&quot;The Syrian Question. Writing in the Echo Jo Paris on September 12th&apos; &quot; Pertinax &quot; welcomes the arrival of Mr. Floyd George and Lord Alleuby in Paris. After describing the &quot; deliberate &quot; measures taken by certain British officials to obstruct the French cause in Syria, he concludes by saying that a definite settlement is probably impracticable so Jong as Turkish problem cannot be considered as a whole ; but a provisional settlement is imperative, and these are its broad lines : (1) Recall of the British troops occupying zones both of direct and of indirectadministration allotted to France in .1910. (2) Recognition of the principle that in these two zones Emir Feisal, in thematter of subsidies, &amp;c., has to do with France alone.Commenting on a pro-British article written by M. Alfred Capus in the E-igaro, Sir G. Grahame alludes to the effect of the Syrian question on Anglo-French relations as follows :  &quot; Such sentiments as those uttered by M. Capus can only be hailed with satisfaction as a corrective to what has of late been only too noticeable in all the chief French newspapers. I regret to say, however, that it does not appear to me an accurate representation of the facts when M. Capus declares that there has been no movement in France in a sense unfavourable to England. For many weeks Great Britain has been persistently, and in many instances virulently, attacked almost daily by just those newspapers which have the power to influence public opinion, and these attacks have, in my opinion, produced the suspicion of British, policy which is now prevalent. It is to be hoped, in the interests of the relations between the two countries, that this unfavourable impression has not gone very deep and may soon be effaced. In any case, the chief blame for this state of things must bo laid at the door of the French leader-writers. While this campaign was in progress there was no sign that the French Government took steps to moderate it, in spite of the repre-sentations which were made through the French Embassy in London and by myself to M. Pichon, and in private conversation to various French officials and others. One is, therefore, forced to the conclusion that it suited the purposes of the French Government that tho French Press should inveigh against British action in Syria and thus bring the matter into prominence both here and in England, in the expectation that this campaign would make His Majesty&apos;s Government anxious to come to some speedy settlement of the Syrian question in the sense of French desires, and induce on their part a more amenable frame of mind than might have been the case if public opinion had not been aroused on the subject.&quot;
Upper Silesia.- According to a Nauen Report (September 14th), the Inter-Allied Military Commission on their return from Upper Silesia have given the German Government a summary of their views on the situation, have offered their mediation for tbe establishment of peaceful conditions, and at the same time made certain proposals. The Commission consider that the national Polish agitation from beyond the frontier was partially responsible for the disturbances, and demand a series of measures on the part of the Polish authorities. In the Commission^ opinion the Poles must quietly await the occupation of Upper Silesia by foreign troops for the purpose of carrying out the Peace Treaty. The proposals to the German Government include a general amnesty and the permission for all refugees who have quitted the disturbed area to return to their homes. In addition, the Commission recommend that all excesses against the population should be avoided. The German Government, in conjunction with the Prussian Government have immediately taken the Entente Commission^ proposals into consideration, and have given a reply that is in sub-stautial agreement with them. As regards the return of refugees, this has already taken place to a certain extent, lire question of a general amnesty has already formed the subject of negotiations between Germany and Poland, which, as is well known, were broken off by the latter. Should these be -resumed, the question will doubtless be settled. Naturally the German Government in all its deliberations must be guided by the principle that the permanent pacification of Upper Silesia should be attained and assured.A Warsaw Wireless Report (September .11th) contains the following document, which is alleged to have been captured from the Germans : &quot; Fourth Prussian secret documents seized by the insurgents. Noske, the Minister of Defence, announces by letter dated June 29th to the General Commanding; the Fourth Army Corps at Wroclaw : -&quot; &apos; All reports state that the Poles have an overwhelming majority in Upper Silesia. In addition, the Armies of Occupation, whether UallePs, or American and English, will support the Poles. Although the German Government is compelled officially not to undertake anything which might influence the result of the plebiscite in Upper Silesia, all the German military authorities agree that everything must be done to secure a victory for the German minority. The War Ministry indicated the following measures as suitable:  &quot; &apos; Brzeg, a frontier town, will be the centre of our propaganda. The Director of Propaganda and other persons entrusted with governmental power will reside near to the scene of operations. These gentlemen will travel incognito, and must be afforded every possible assistance. Draw attention to the gravity of the cause. The intervention of the Government is inevitable in all circumstances. Every Pole arrested, incriminated, or condemned, is to be deported to the correctional establish-ments in Saxony aud Middle Silesia, for it is to be feared that if released they will not fail to cany on propaganda against Germany. The General Commanding must conform to the instructions given by von Stillern, furnishing reports from time to time.&apos; &quot; (Sgd.)      vox II[else, Adjutant.&apos; &quot;A further report from Warsaw (September 25th) states : &quot; At Glogow, in Upper Silesia, bloody reprisals have recommenced. German patrols, armed with machine guns, are to be found on the roads.   Dead Poles cannot vote! &quot;East Prussia and Poland. A well-attended meeting in the Masurian district has decided to forward to the Government a resolution pointing out the danger which threatens the food supplies of East Prussia, owing to the smuggling into Poland of great quantities of corn. The resolution begs for adequate military protection against the encroachments of the Poles, who are assembling troops on the frontier with great speed. The conclusion of the resolution runs : -&quot;We Masurians in the plebiscite district do not wish to suffer the fate of Upper Silesia and still less to experience the repetition of the atrocities we were obliged to endure in the winter of 1914. We will allow nothing to shake our loyalty to German nationality (Deutschtum) and to the German State. In return, however, we expect the German State to defend our hwes and food supplies &quot; (Nauen, September 14th).Plerr Scheidemann on the future of Socialism. At a great people&apos;s assembly in Cassel, Scheidemann delivered a vigorous speech against the danger of monarchy and civil war which threatened the Government from the Right and the danger of SovietS884-31 - C
Dictatorship and civil war which threatened them from the Left. He declared that the naked despotism of the Russian Soviet dictatorship would not please the German workers even for a fortnight. A beaten people, physically and morally shattered by the terrible war, could not with one stroke be turned into a band of happy and contented beings. Even Socialism could bring only gradual help. He would never have signed the Peace Treaty, but once it had been signed the German people should endeavour to carry out their acknowledged obligations. Scheidemann expressed his belief in the better future of the German people and that the difficult task of leading them to this goal had been allotted to the Majority Socialists (Nauen, September 13th).The Communist Party. The Monthly Review of the Progress of Revolutionary Movements Abroad circulated by the Iiome Secretary (G.T. 8156) contains the following notes on the future of the Communist Party in Germany : &quot; The German Commuuist Part3T, which appears to be steadily growing, has established a central office in Berlin, with working branches in the Federal States and Provinces. There is evidence that the party is now working in conjunction with the Independent Socialists and, at the same time, keeping in close touch with the various civil, military and naval extremists, both at home and abroad. The Government, however, which can count upon the support of the regular troops, who now number about 400,000, seems able to control the situation for the present, and on the 22nd of August directed the military authorities to occupy the building used as the headquarters of the Independent Social Democrats and Communists, whose Executive Council had ordered new elections to be held for the Berlin Workers&apos; Councils. The Executive Council was forbidden to prepare for these elections or further to use the building.&apos;: The situation as regards Bolshevism is likely to become critical during the late autumn, chiefly owing to the lack of coal and raw materials. A member of the Government expected a Spartacist rising in October, and said that the Spartacists had field guns and other arms concealed. Food does not appear to be scarce, but lack of proper control is inflicting serious hardship on the poorer classes. The prices of articles of clothing are still exceedingly high. A pair of boots in Berlin costs 500 marks and a suit of clothes 1,000 marks.&quot;Piolshevik Desire for Peace. Lord Kilmarnock (Copenhagen) learns from a source which is generally reliable that a number of Bolshevik agents attended a recent Conference of the Independent Socialists at Berlin and expressed their desire to conclude peace with Germany, and, subsequently, with the proletariat of the Entente countries.HUNGARY.Rumanian Evacuation. According to a Wireless Report from.&quot; Nauen (September -13th), the Rumanian High Commissioner in Budapest, M. Diamandi, has informed representatives of the Press that the Rumanians would leave Budapest as early as possible after the disarming of the Bolshevik Army.ITALY.D&apos;Anuunzio&apos;s Raid. Referring to d&apos;A.nmmzio&apos;s raid on Fiume, which took place on the morning of September 12th, Sir R. Rodd reported on the 14th that according to the latest telegrams to the Press, the 6th Regiment of Artillery, two batteries of which had intended to join the insurgents at Fiume, had yielded to the exhortations of the officers and had returned to quarters in &apos;perfect order. The -Prefect of Venice, where the plot was organised, had -been removed from office. Fiume was isolated and apparently surrounded with troops. It was stated in the Press that communications with Venice and Trieste as well as with Fiume had been suspended.According to further information received from Sir R. Rodd some 2,600 troops are implicated in the raid on Fiume. They have been ordered to return to their regiments within a certain period. The soldiers are said to have been induced to join the movement owing to the dissemination of false information that the Govern-ment favoured the enterprise.The attitude of the Italian Press continues satisfactory with the exception of certain Nationalist newspapers.
The authorities intend to endeavour to starve the invaders of Fiume into submission.by means of a blockade.On September 12th Signor Nitti made a statement in the Chamber condemning d&apos;Annunzio&apos;s action and deploring this outbreak of sedition and militarism.Signor Nitti on his Policy.-ln a despatch dated August 22nd, Sir R. Rodd describes an interesting conversation between himself and Signor Nitti. After adverting to the fact that Baron Sonnino had, in foreign politics, cpiarrelled with Germans, Slavs, and Anglo-Saxous in turn, and in home politics had denounced the Socialists, proscribed the Giolittians, and made himself odious to the Aratican, Signor Nitti claimed that he had been successful in conciliating all elements, especially the Moderate Socialists, except the extremists, whom he had fought and intended to fight to the death.   Meanwhile he looked forward to a period of internal quiet.He was prejudiced against France but sincere in the conviction that England and Italy must work together. He thought that there was always a tendency to magnify the influence of Gioliiti, but the new electoral law had brought about his political death and an end to his methods.Signor Nitti went on to say that he was working smoothly with the Church.He had obtained evidence of communication between the extreme Socialists and Soviets of Hungary and Russia, and intended to make some sensational arrests.Sir R. Rodd thinks it possible that many of the rumours of Italian intrigues in Hungary may be due to the manoeuvres of the Italian Bolshevik group.NETHERLANDS.Dutch. Opinion on Belgian Claims. In a despatch dated September 11th, Mr. Robertson reports that the Queen&apos;s birthday was celebrated with considerable enthusiasm on August 31st and September 1st. The rejoicings were partly intended as a demonstration of loyalty to the Throne and of anti-Bolshevism, but the determi-nation of the country in regard to the Belgian controversy was strongly emphasised in the Press. Even the possibility of war is being gravely discussed and little confidence seems to be felt that the Allies would intervene to prevent a Belgian coup de main in spjite of the covenant of the League of Nations.Mr. Robertson again directs attention to the feeling prevalent in Holland. It is argued that prior to the war nothing was heard of Belgian claims to Dutch territory. The Belgian lowns and Belgian trade were in a flourishing condition. Because this has changed owing to the war, the Dutch see no reason why Belgium should be compensated at their expense. The Belgians have no rights&quot; at all on Dutch territory or waters, but the Butch are prepared to make concessions which may even affect the prosperity and interests of Rotterdam in favour of its rival Antwerp, provided that it is clearly understood that such concessions are an act of grace and not an admission of rights. In view of the clamour of the Belgian extremist Press and of the publication of the notorious memorandum to the Belgian Headquarters Staff regarding propaganda in Limburg, public opinion is unalterably opposed to a military convention for the defence of Limburg.SERBIA, AND SERB-CROAT-SLOVENE KINGDOM.Reconstruction of the Government. In a despatch dated September 6th Sir C. des Graz deals with M. Davidovitchs attempt to form a Coalition Government. He writes : &quot;The negotiations between the President of the Council aud representatives of other political parties in the National Assembly to endeavour to form a Coalition Govern-nlent have not yet achieved full success, though they are said to be proceeding satisfactorily.&quot; M. Davidovitch is certainly optimistic, as he told me himself a day or two ago that he hoped soon to have a Government on a stable basis.*&apos; It would be superfluous to enter into all the details of this long-drawn-out crisis due to the comparatively equal strength of the two principal political groups. But it has been interesting to note that in the course of the week, on the one hand members of the National Croatian Club (or Starchevists), numbering 28, have drawn nearer to the Government, and on the other hand, and probably in. consequence, that the Old Radicals have, one hears, somewhat modified their original conditions as to their participation in the Government.&quot;This till the next turn of the wheel of negotiations places the Government in a distinctly more favourable position.&quot;
According to latest information received from Belgrade (Sir C. des Graz September 13th and 15th), M. DavidovitclFs Ministry having failed to obtain the omission of certain stipulations in the Austrian Peace terms relating to minorities and finding itself in agreement with the heads of the political parties not represented in the Cabinet, is unable to sign the Treaty as it stands and has in consequence resigned.   M. Pavlovich has been entrusted with the formation of a new Ministry.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.Handbooks prepared in the Historical Section of the Foreign Office.
