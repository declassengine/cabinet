WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Relaxation of Trade Restrictions. According to the Monthly Report of the work of the Board of Trade for March (G.T. 7111) a general licence has been issued authorising with certain reservations the resumption of trade with Croatia, Slavonia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, and those parts of Dalmatia with which trade has not previously been licensed.Subject to safeguards with regard to re-export aud the observance of existing agreements the Superior Blockade Council has adopted a resolution that on and after April 25th, 1919, commodities other than finished munitions of war may be imported by the Northern Neutral countries and Switzerland without limit as to quantity and without requiring the issuance of individual import certificates as a condition precedent to the issuance of an export licence by the Associated Governments (Astoria, April 16th).Withdrawal of Blach Lists. The Blockade Council has issued the following communication : The Allied and Associated Governments have decided that after midnight, April 2Sth, all Black Lists of firms and persons which they have published or compiled shall be withdrawn, and that all disabilities attaching to trade and communication with linns or persons on such lists shall cease to operate.The Allied and Associated Governments reserve the right to reintroduce all or any of such Black Lists should such action become necessary (Astoria, April 23rd).Food Supplies. Lord Robert Cecil gives the following information in a telegram dated April 22nd :-The following quantities in metric tons of food were delivered during month of March by the Associated Powers : Poland, 51,285 ; Finland, 36,344; Esthonia, Aaland Islands, Murmansk, 650 ; Czecho-Slovakia, 29,455 ; Greater Serbia, 33,922 ; Rumania, 26,967 ; Armenia, 5,252 ; Belgium, 138,363 ; Russian prisoners in Germany, 1,829; German-Austria, 38,156 ; Turkey, 2,998. To this must be added t,384 tons of clothing and other relief supplies. Shipping to the amount of 373,605 tons was placed at the disposal of Mr. Hoover, Director-General of Relief,&apos; for arrival in Europe in March under the auspices of the Supreme Economic Council. In other words, excluding Germany and Bulgaria, but including German-Austria, during March 11,780 tons of food a day were being delivered to avert starvation. Total cost of relief for Europe for March amounted approximately to 22,000,000?. Relief supplies this month and in May should arrive in increased quantities owing to the availability of a larger amount of tonnage including German and Austrian ships. The difficulty is ceasing to be one of shipping and is now one of finance.The United States is taking the lead in rationing Europe, but the United Kingdom has appropriated twelve and a half millions sterling for this purpose in addition to large quantities of food and clothing given by British armies in the. re-occupied areas. British representatives are taking an active part in the work of the Inter-Allied Relief Missions in Poland, Serbia, Austria, Rumania, and other countries. But food relief without means of transit or distribution is ineffective. We have, therefore, with the consent of the Treasury, approved the expenditure of 1,000,0001. lor railway material in Rumania and Poland. Additional measures to support national life and hasten economic restoration such as the provision of coal and raw materials are also being arranged.Repatriation of Russian Prisoners. His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for War-has circulated a note by the General Staff dealing with the policj&apos; of repatriating Russian prisoners of war from Germany via the Western frontier of Russia (G.T. 7134). The number of Russian prisoners in Germany is estimated at 500,000, and their return to Soviet Russia is open to the following objections : (I) They would be forced to join the Bolshevik forces under threat of starvation ; (2) Anti-Bolsheviks, especially officers, would run the danger of being shot; (3) their services would be lost to the pro-Ally Russian Governments; (4) it would be difficult for such a large
number of men to pass through the Polish and Lithuanian lines without endangering the armies holding them.The International Socialist Conference at Berne. Attention is drawn to a Memorandum (G.T. 7127) issued by the Political lntelliger.ee Department of the Foreign Office on the International Socialist Conference at Berne of February 1919 and its outcome. The last paragraph sums up the writer&apos;s views on the future of the Internationale : &quot; A heavy loss in prestige by the Russian Bolsheviks might conceivably bring about a closing up of the rift (i.e , between the non-national Zimmerwaldian and the national &apos; Sozialpatriot&apos; parties). In tins event the practical re-establishment of the old Internationale would conceivably be effected. It would then, there is every reason for asserting, be again largely under the influence of German Social Democracy. In 1871 the victory of the Germans had the effect, as Marx prophesied, of shifting the balance of power in the working-class movement from France to Germany. The victory of France and her Allies will not do the reverse, &quot;for the German defeat, though depressing the prestige of the bourgeois parties, raised that of the Socialists, and it was not as defeated Germans so much as triumphant Social Democrats that the German delegates appeared at the Berne Conference. When the Conference re-assembles in August next it will be interesting to see how the two tendencies have worked out disintegration caused by the Bolshevist Revolution and the assertion of German or pro-German domination caused by the German Revolution of November 191S.&quot;ALLIED GROUP.BRAZIL.The League of Nations. The   Brazilian   Minister  for   Foreign  Affairs  has. addressed a note to Sir A. Peel stating that Brazil is anxious to be represented on the Executive Council of the League of Nations as one of the four Powers with restricted interests.china.Repatriation of Chinese Coolies. The question of allowing Chinese Bolsheviks to return from. Russia to China has been dropped (Foreign Office, April 17th.)Repatriation of Missionaries. Lord Reading has been instructed to point out to the State Department at Washington the desirability of deporting members of the German Mission in Shantung and the Basle Mission in Canton, both of which have carried on active political propaganda, unless there are in individual cases very strong reasons for exemption.FRANCERadical-Socialist Croup and Peace. A delegation of the Radical-Socialist Group of the Chamber, headed by M. Rene Renoult, held an interview with M. Clemenceau for. the purpose of obtaining information as to the state of the peace negotiations. A summary of the interview is given in the Temps. M. Renoult set forth the aims of the Radical-Socialist Group, which consisted in the early formation of the League of Nations, material guarantees for F s the country most exposed to Germany,the organisation of the French frontier against further, aggression, the disarma-&apos; ihent of Germany and the control of her military forces so as to permit France to -occupy herself with the problems of reconstruction, full reparation of all war losses, and the guarantee of the coal supply for France by the administration of the Sarre mines. M. Clemenceau replied that a complete agreement had been arrived at between France and her allies with regard to reparation and the Sarre basin, and that a settlement of the future Franco-German frontiers had almost been reached1 (Lord Derby, April 13th).France and Syria. According to the Matin, the Emir Feisul is persuaded, in. common with all Syrians, that the only European nation which can assure the inde-pendence of Syria is France.   This be will make clear to his compatriots.   The
Anglo-French Agreement of 1910 seems to have been given up. Among other-objections to this Treaty was that of trying to split up Syria. The French Govern-ment and the Emir Feisul will follow a common policy which will re-establish its integrity and independence (Lord Derby, April 18th).ITALY.Strike at Milan. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Feme reports that, in protest against the dispersal by police of a Socialist meeting at Milan, a 24 hours&apos; strike was proclaimed on April 14th. A collision occurred between two sets of demonstrators, and some casualties appear to have been incurred both among demonstrators and troops. The strike bas been extended for a further 24 hours. The Ministers of. War&apos; and Public Works have left for Milan to open an enquiry.Coal Supplies. -Six hundred thousand tons of coal have been placed at the disposal of the Italian Coal Commission for shipment from the United Kingdom during April provided sufficient tonnage is available (Foreign Office, April 18th).JAPAN.Revolt in Corca. Sir C. Jordan reports&apos; that the Press announced the establish-ment of a Corean Provisional Government at Seoul on April Oth. According to His Majesty&apos;s representative at Mukden, the Chinese authorities, though not unsympathetic towards the Corean movement, are preventing manifestations by Nationalists. A large number of Corean refugees are reported to have crossed into Manchuria.SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.   .Montenegro. The French Ministry for Foreign Affairs has informed Lord Derby that the evacuation ordered by General Franchet d&apos;Esperey has not been carried out either by Serbian or Italian troops, the commanders of which declare that they have not received confirmation of the order from their Governments. In order to avoid a conflict of a political character the General has been instructed to renew bis order with a time limit, after which he will declare that he considers the troops not executing this order as not under his command.Count de Salis is being sent on a mission to ascertain the circumstances which attended the Montenegrin elections in November and the subsequent decision to unite with Serbia, and, if possible, to discover the wishes of the people with regard to the future status of the country (Foreign Office, April 20th).Croatia. Statements with regard to the existence of a Separatist movement in Croatia are believed in Belgrade to be based only upon Italian reports. There is a very small Austrophil party in Croatia and a considerable Starchevist party which desires some form of Federalism under the Italian crown (Sir C. des Graz, April 17th).Fiume. Sir C. des Graz learns that Italian action at Fiume has become more arbitrary while the Jugo-Slavs believe that the town will be constituted by the Peace Conference as a B-ee port under a Jugo-Slav mandate. Public feeling is considerably excited.UNITED STATES.The League of Nations. The Press&apos;generally approves of the amendments to the League safeguarding the Monroe, doctrine, and criticism has considerably, abated, though such papers, as the Tribune and Sun, which represent the policy of extreme opposition, still find the new proposals unacceptable. It seems to be generally accepted, that the changes introduced meet the views of a sufficient proportion of- the. Senate opposition to remove the danger of- a refusal to. ratify the. covenant. Even the Tribune, admits &quot; sentiment for. the general idea, is strong &quot; (Lord Reading, April .17th and 23rd).British Bureau of Information. Lord Reading submits a scheme for the establishment of; an. official Bureau, of Information in London under the authority of the Foreign Office, with, a branch at Washington under the. Embassy and minor, branches, throughout, the United States.   He states that though the relations between
ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Hungary. Air. Clive (Stockholm) has received a report to the effect that the Hungarian population is terrorised by some 25,000 armed guards. The Soviet Government has strengthened its position by the assertion that it has been recognised by the Peace Conference. The greater part of the population expected and desired Allied intervention, but now the belief is growing that the Rumanian, Serbian and Czech Governments regard the growth of Bolshevism as the best means of annexing further Hungarian territory.Two Hungarians of the Pallavicini family, who recently passed through Belgrade, stated that in their part of the country the movement was Nationalist and that a Hungarian anti-Bolshevik Committee had been formed with headquarters at Vienna (Sir C. des Graz, April .16th).Sir C. des Graz supports the view that Garbai&apos;s Government has strengthened its position. Arrests and terrorism are reported to be on the increase. It is stated, however, that the Government is prepared to enter into negotiations with the Allies.At the opening meeting of the Budapest Central Council of Workers and Soldiers, Bela Run declared that so long as there was a bourgeoisie there would be a proletariat, therefore the former must be destroyed. He then spoke in praise of the Council system, which was the first step in Communism. They were working in the interests of the international proletarian revolution (Budapest, April 16th).Revolutionary Military Tribunals have been established (Budapest, April 15th) and the directorship of factories &quot; has been taken over by workmen&apos;s Councils. Socialisation has not been so generally carried out in the Provinces (Budapest, April 19th).Transylvania. In a telegram dated April 13th the four Ministers at Bucharest report that the Rumanian Government, in view of the complaints received of intolerable Hungarian aggression, has ordered the occupation of Transylvania up to the line laid clown by the Versailles Conference of February 16th.According to the Hungarian Military Report (April 21st) the Rumanians have launched an attack in the neighbourhood of Zilah, a few miles west of the Tran-sylvanian border.German-Austria--On April 17th a large demonstration took place in Vienna, ending in a riot (Nauen, April 19th).According to a Budapest Wireless Report (April 16th) Forster, leader of the Viennese Communists, declared at a meeting in Sopron that the proclamation of the Hungarian proletarian dictatorship had brought the Communist movement in German-Austria a good step forward. The reason why German-Austria had not yet proclaimed the proletarian dictatorship was that the German-Austrian workmen were entirely dependent on the Entente for their food supply. The proclamation of a proletarian dictatorship in German-Austria was only a question of clays.Union with Germany. Lord Acton learns that a German Finance Commission arrived at Vienna ou April 10th. The Germans intend, it is stated, to make the following offers in return for the union of German-Austria with Germany: (1) Germany will take over the German-Austrian national debt ; (2) she wdll give favourable exchange for the conversion of crowns to marks. Herr Bauer is reported to be in favour of immediate union.Gzecho-Slovakia. A bill for the expropriation by purchase of large estates, which will henceforth belong to the State, has been passed by the National Assembly. The bill is regarded as a concession to the Social Democrats (Mr. Gosling, April 19th).778g-46 BGreat Britain and the United States are better now than at any time except during the actual period of the United States participation in the war, a revival of traditional anti-British sentiment, though not to be exaggerated, must be expected chiefly on account of suspicion of British commercial policy and the activities of the Irish and German elements. An information bureau, officially recognised, is considered the best method of keeping in touch with sentiment in various parts of the conn toy and of counteracting anti-British propaganda.
Mr. Gosling learns that the distribution of food relief is not being regularly-conducted. While Western Bohemia is well supplied, destitution prevails in the north-east.GERMANY.Political Situation. (1) General. Lord Acton has been informed by a recent visitor to Germany that the Bolshevik menace is real and not an expedient to induce the Allies to revise their peace terms. The future depends upon the Allies&apos; capacity to revictual Germany.According to reports from German industrial centres received by Sir W. Townley even workmen, who were formerly reliable, are going over to the Bolshevik cause. Prolonged starvation, the lack, of raw materials, and the want of everyday comforts are given as reasons for this.(The following notes, unless otherwise stated, are taken from German Wireless Reports, the dates of which are given in brackets.)(2) Bavaria. As the result of a great demonstration which took place in Munich on April 13th, the railway station, barracks and headquarters of the Republican Defence Corps fell into the hands of the Communists (April 15th). At a meeting of the Workmen&apos;s and Industrial Councils the following resolutions were adopted :  (1) The true dictatorship of the proletariat; (2) the arming of organised workmen; (3) an immediate general strike, to last until the leaders of the Central Council have been liberated (April 16th). A new Executive Committee has been formed under Dr. Levien. Miihlsam and Landauer have returned to Munich (April 17th). Publication of newspapers has been suspended (April 20th). Augsberg has been occupied by Government troops (April 23rd), but the situation at Munich, which, according to latest reports, is surrounded, remains obscure.According to the former Bavarian Minister at Berne the Communists derive support from the fact that they advocate particularism, while the Hoffmann Govern-ment inclines towards centralisation as represented at Weimar (Lord Acton, April 17th).Dr. Muhlon.is of opinion that the hostility of the peasant population will bring-about the fall of the Bolshevik Munich Government (Lord Acton, April 15th).(3) Tiuhr District. The strike is gradually coming to an end (April 18th).(4) West Prussia. The strikes have ended except at Danzig, Graudenz, and Derschau (April 16th).(5) Bremen. A general strike commenced on April 16th (April .17th). (6) Hamburg. Serious Communist disturbances occurred on April 15th (April 17th).(7) Brunswick. On April 17th, General Marker, in command of the Government troops, proclaimed a state of siege.   Eichhorn has been arrested (April 18th).In negotiations between General Marker and the governing- committee of the Assembly, attempts have been made to come to an agreement about the formation of the Cabinet. It is to consist of four or five Majority Socialists, two Independents and one Democrat; Dr. Jasper is to be Prime Minister. He-is also President of the Brunswick Assembly. This provisional Cabinet is to hold office until the Assembly, which meets on April 24th, shall have formed a new one.The Peace Terms. In reply to .the Entente note that delegates with full powers to negotiate on all peace questions must be sent to Versailles, the following delegates have been appointed : Count Brockdorff-Rantzau, Dr. Landsberg, Herren Giesberts, Leinert, Melchior, and Schticking (Nauen, April 22nd). The same report makes the statement that &quot; the Allies can see from the events of the last few months that the German working classes will not be compelled to work even for Germany, much less will they work for foreign capitalism unless the terms are just.&quot;Lord Acton reports that according to a reliable informant, Count Brockdorff-Rantzau and Herr Erzberger are said to have stated definitely that the German Government is prepared to restore all damage done in Northern France, to redeem receipts given for requisitioned goods, and to redeem German bank notes circu-lating in occupied territories, though not more than 2,000,O00,000L will be paid to cover all indemnities and reparations. The German Government is further prepared to replace tonnage insured by private firms, but not tonnage insured by the State. It will refuse to cede Danzig to Poland, though the latter may obtain a commercial
outlet to the sea. No peace will be accepted which does not admit Germany to the League of Nations.Sir 0. Marling, on the other hand, has received information to the effect that the German Government&apos;? attitude with regard to peace is only bluff, since it is fully realised that Germany can be starved into submission.The Papal Agent at Berne states that since the Armistice the German attitude has changed owing to the continuation of the blockade, the retention of prisoners, and the delays of the Peace Conference. In his opinion harsh peace terms may lead to the overthrow of the present Government and the rule of Communism in alliance with Russia (Lord Acton, April 17th).- Dr. M union considers that, in the present state of public opinion no German Government signing the peace terms imposed by the, Entente would be able to carry them out or induce the nation as a whole to adhere to them. Dr. Miihlon does not, however, fear the development of Bolshevism, which is opposed by the German peasantry, but thinks that a future Government might turn to Russia for support in order to free itself from the economic blockade. The most pronounced and genuine feeling of the people at the present time is said to be revulsion against all Government control, whether it is of the paternal character of the old regime or the wholesale, nationalisation advocated by the Socialists (Lord Acton, April 15th).Congress of Councils. At the final meeting of the Congress of Councils, questions of foreign policy were discussed. Kaliski (Majority Socialist) advocated better relations with France.A resolution was passed, stating that the Congress repudiated the foreign policy of the present Government and objected particularly to ErzbergeFs position on the Armistice Commission, as this tended to increase the breach between Germany and France and make a Socialist League of Nations impossible. lie declared that the Germans were falsely informed about the situation in foreign countries, correct reports as to which might assist them to come to an understanding with ,France and Russia. He demanded cessation of hostilities against the Soviet Government and a friendly policy towards all nations, particularly Russia.A motion was also adopted demanding the publication of all documents concerning the beginning of the war (Nauen, April 16th).Herren Cohen and Fuss (Majority Socialists) have been elected Presidents of the Central Council. An Executive Committee has been formed consisting of eight Majority Socialists and one Democrat (Nauen, April 17th).Berlin Councils.- As a result of the new elections the Executive Council of the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils of Great Berlin now consist of 13 Independent Social Democrats, 2 Majority Socialists, 3 Communists, and 1 Democrat; the extreme elements, therefore, possess a clear majority (Nauen, April 21st).Russian Relations. The Prime Minister of Esthonia has given Mr. Bosanquet (Reval) information with regard to an alleged Russo-German Agreement (vide also under &quot; Baltic Provinces &quot;). According to this information a meeting was held in Berlin on April 6th, at which 38 Soviet delegates were present, and a resolution was passed in favour of the establishment of a commission of Russian and German representatives for the purpose of ascertaining what common action could be taken against the Entente. Resolutions were also passed for the manufacture of war material in Russia and the provision of raw materials and exports by Germany. Herr Ebert is reported to have referred to a secret treaty with Russia at a Cabinet meeting held on April 5th. It should be noted, however, that this information was accompanied by an appeal for Allied intervention in Esthonia.TIerr Schiffer s Successor. On April 19t.li Herr Dernburg was nominated successor to Herr Schiffer as Minister of Finance (German Wireless Report).Emigration Movement. It is reported from Essen that Communists are conducting active propaganda for emigration among the workmen in the Ruhr district. Argentina and Brazil are especially mentioned. The agitators point out that Germany is in a serious economic state and cannot support a population of more than 50 millions. The emigrants are to keep up a close connection with Germany.   The movement is finding considerable support (JSTauen, April 18th).Spotted Fever and Smallpox. In the week April 3rd to 9th there were 25 cases of spotted fever in Germany with three deaths, and 33 cases of small-pox with
11 deaths. Eight of the former and three of the latter were in Berlin (Nauen, April 20th).German Wireless Reports. Protests against the annexation of the Sarre Valley and of the Province of Poland, and threats that Germany will refuse to sign the peace, are still conspicuous in the German Wireless Reports.NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.The Port Strike. Sir R. Tower states that the port strike ended on February 3rd, the shipping lockout on March 17th and the coastwise lockout on April 8th. A Government decree compels shipowners to resume work, labour being supplied by the port authorities. No guarantees have been given prohibiting the right of boycott. The Liner Freight Committee has decided to cease, further bookings of cargo so long-as the right of boycott in maintained.The elections have resulted in a continued majority for the President.BALTIC PROVINCES.Overthrow of the Lettish Government. On April 20th Mr. Grant-Watson (Libau) reported that Baltic German troops, acting under the orders of General von der Goltz, had arrested certain members of the Lettish Government. The Baltic Germans only numbered about 6 per cent, of the population and were so far unable to form a Government of their own. If the German troops were withdrawn, they would not be strong enough both to maintain order and to resist the Bolshevik invasion.The Senior Naval Officer at Libau reports that the Germans have officially and definitely refused permission for the mobilisation of the Lettish Army (Admiralty Weekly Appreciation, No. 17).Sir 0. Marling has been supplied with the following information. According to the Lettish representative at Copenhagen the Germans have disarmed the Lettish troops. The coup was engineered by Baron Manteuffel ICatzdangen, a notorious pan-German, in conjunction with the Baltic Barons, who have formed a project for the establishment of a new Baltic State.From another source Sir C. Marling learns that the German High Command sent the best Lettish troops to the front while they withdrew German contingents. The Letts show an increasing unwillingness to fight alongside the Germans, and a fear is expressed that they may go over to the Bolsheviks unless help is forthcoming from the Entente.On the other hand, Baron Ungern Sternberg, formerly Secretary of the Russian Legation at Copenhagen, who has recently arrived from Libau, states the causes of the coup were wholly domestic. It was to a considerable extent brought about by Russian landowners, who wished to prevent the Government enacting laws for the expropriation of landed estates. The Germans merely maintained order during the crisis (Sir C. Marling, March 17th and ISth).The Esthonian Prime Minister, who is anxious with regard to the effect of the Libau movement on the situation in Esthonia, thinks the coup was the result of an understanding between the Soviet and the German Government.The Lettish representative at Copenhagen has communicated to Sir C. Marling the text of an appeal signed by all the Lettish political groups, with the exception of the Baltic Germans, protesting against the action of General von der Goltz and demanding his removal.Situation at Riga. The following message appears in the German Wireless Report of April 20th :--&quot; Representatives of the Riga bourgeoisie now in Libau have issued an appeal pointing out the desperate state of affairs in Riga.&quot; On March 20th the Bolshevik authorities left Riga, and the bourgeois population became a prey to an armed mob.&quot; Up to March 20th 6,000 men were executed by the Bolsheviks.
&quot; On march 26th the Bolsheviks began to remove women, old men, aud children from the bourgeois quarter to the Dun a Island (Ilasen), where they are housed in barracks, and left to die of starvation, cold, and disease.&quot;Libau appeals to the Powers to send assistance at once and support the Baltic National Committee in its work of relief.&quot;Sir C. Marling and Mr. Clive furnish similar reports.Esthonia. Mr. Bosanquet (Reval) reports the following result of the election to the Esthonian Constituent Assembly: Social Democrats, 42; Labour, 32; National Party, 25; Esthonia National Party; 9 ; Social Revolutionaries, 7 ; German, 1 ; Russian, 1.The Prime Minister, Mr. Pacts, is alarmed by certain proposals for a separate peace wir.li Russia, which emanates from the Labour Parties.BOLIVIA.German-owned Mines. The Bolivian Government, which apprehends the result of the closing down of German-owned mines upon the mineral export tax and native employment, has entered into negotiations with the United States Government with a view to establishing a Commission to be appointed by the Allied and Bolivian Governments for the control and operation of these mines. The note has received a favourable reply (Lord Reading, April 17th).DENMARK.Unrest. Fears are entertained of an outbreak of Spartacist disturbances in Flensborg and its neighbourhood, where industrial work has ceased owing to coal shortage &quot;(Sir O Marling, April 19th).International Russian League. A Provisional Committee of the International Russian League has been formed. The objects of the League, in which it is hoped to enrol 200,000 active members, are to distribute provisions and reorganise industry in Russia, and to provide the necessarv police protection for this purpose (Sir C. Marling, April 18th).FINLAND.The Government. Mr. Castren has been charged by General Mannerheim with the formation of a new Cabinet, which will be Republican in form.

At a political dinner held at Lausanne on April 11th, M. A dor, the President of the Swiss Confederation, delivered a speech, in which he touched upon the following questions: (1) More intimate contact between the Government and the people. Powers which properly belonged to the Federal Assembly shordd not be.concentrated in the hands of the Federal Council. (2) Aliens. Though Switzerland must defend herself against undesirables, she intended to maintain her traditional hospitality in favour of all. those who sought the rest and health of which they stood in need. (3) The League of Nations. Switzerland had formulated her own point, of view, which was that the League of Nations ought to be constituted with the collaboration of all the nations destined to belong to it. Switzerland could not, however, abandon her neutrality until it was known that the League was based upon satisfactory principles. In June the Federal Council intended to lay before the Chambers a message respecting the entry of Switzerland into the League of Nations; both the Swiss people and the Cantonal Governments would be called on freely to discuss this question, which might entail profound modifications of the constitution of the country. If the seat of the League of Nations was to be established in Switzerland, that fact would, in the speakeFs opinion, of itself settle the question of Swiss neutrality, for the League must naturally desire the country in which it had its seat to be safe from aggression and invasion. For the great honour of harbouring the League of Nations  an honour which would perhaps solve that most difficult question of her neutrality   Switzerland had to thank England, America and Italy, who had energetically supported her claims and those of Geneva (Lord Acton, April 11th).
