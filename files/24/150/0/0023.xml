WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Bolshevism. Attention is directed to a Memorandum (G.T. 712S) issued by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office on the Aims and Strategy of Bolshevism.Relaxation of Trade Restrictions. Following upon the resolution adopted hy the Superior Blockade -Council for facilitating.the importation of commodities into neutral countries after April 25th (vide Report No. 116, page 2) the further recommendations are made that (1) all restrictions on the export and import trade between Germany and the neutrals other than gold and silver securities and materials of war should be suspended. Germany is, however, to hold 50 per cent, of her dye stocks for purchase, by the Associated Governments; (2) each Allied Government should determine for itself to what extent its subjects may enter into trade relations with the enemy ; (3) the relaxations may be withdrawn if Germany shows an hostile attitude or if her Government gives proof of instability.Food Supplies. The following resolution dias been passed by the Supreme Economic Council: &quot; Whereas it is the a-iew of the Supreme Economic Council that there is no possibility of Germany obtaining imports of foodstuffs equal to the ration of 370,000 tons per month as fixed by the Brussels Agreement, it is resolved that the Superior Blockade Council is authorised to dispense with the existing requirement that shipments of foodstuffs from Northern neutral countries and Switzerland to Germany receive the approval of the respective Inter-Allied Trade Committees &quot; (Astoria, April ^Sth).ALLIED GROUP.BRAZIL.Enemy Sliips. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has approached Sir A. PeelAvith a vieAv to obtaining the permission of the Peace Conference for the retention by Brazil of the German ships which Avere seized in Brazilian ports. Their retention is particularly desired, both for financial reasons and in order to strengthen the position of the President, ayIio has been violently - attacked for neglecting BraziLs interests in regard to losses and claims.CHINA.Import of Arms. At a meeting of the Corps Diplomatique representatives of the following PoAvers, Great Britain. France, the United States, Japan, Spain, Portugal, Russia and Brazil, agreed to enforce upon their nationals in China the terms of the resolution respecting the prohibition of arms and ammunition (Sir J. Jordan, April 26th).FRANCE.Labour Demonstration. Preparations are &quot;being made for a vast Labour demonstration, including a 24 hours&apos; strike, to take place on May 1st.The Minister of Public Works has published a circular in the Press protesting against the decision of the railwaymen partially to stop Avork on May 1st.Ilumanite describes the demonstration as &quot;a- general mobilisation of the working-classes in France&quot; and as &quot;a warning to the governing, capitalist and military castes that the labour classes are determined to do away with the present
regime.&quot; As the Temps observes, the intention is not so much to agitate for definite reforms as to demonstrate the power of the proletariat (Lord Derby, April 26th).The French Press and Italy. The French Press (April 24th), while manifesting generally its grave concern at the decision of the Italian Delegation to leave the Conference in consequence of President Wilson&apos;s declaration, does not admit that the rupture can be definite, and expresses its earnest hope that Mr. Lloyd George and Monsieur Clemenccau, the plenipotentiaries of the Governments which signed with Italy the Treaty of 191.5 and the Declaration of London, will succeed in finding some way out of the impasse which has arisen.Stress is particularly laid on the inopportuneness of President Wilson&apos;s declaration so shortly before the arrival of the German delegates in France.M. Bainville (Action Francaisc) comments on the unfortunate effect which the declaration will be likely to have in Germany. The Matin deplores the fact that after four months of secret negotiations, President Wilson should make a public announcement testifying, not to the amity between the Allies, but to their disagree-ment among themselves. M. Rene d&apos;Aral (Gaulois) remarks that it is not impossible that Italy will recommence war against the Jugo-Slavs, and adds that in that case Franco will not hesitate to respect the terms of the Pact of London and continue her alliance with Italy.M. Saint Brice, while.blaming the Italians for what he describes as a tactical error in publishing prior to the negotiations the programme of their claims and thus dispelling any possibility of bargaining, blames President Wilson still more for his action in issuing his declaration at a moment when there was still a chance of a compromise being arrived at. Pertinax (Echo de Paris) takes President Wilson violently to task for an act &quot; which shakes the foundations of the whole Alliance.&quot;The sympathies of the Socialist Press are, however, on the side of President Wilson, and M. Renoult (Humanite) observes that the Italian incident is another result of the Imperialism which has provoked disorders in Egypt and in India.Monsieur Gauvain (Journal dps Debats), the principal champion of the Jugo-Slavs in the French Press, warmly approves the terms of President Wilson&apos;s declara-tion. He only regrets that the eve of the arrival of the German plenipotentiaries should have been chosen as the moment to make a declaration which should have been issued at beginning of negotiations (Lord Derby, April 24th).ITALY.The Peace Deadlock, His Majesty&apos;s representative at Rome reports that feelings of deep and universal resentment and indignation, even among many moderate Socialists, have been aroused not only against President Wilson, who is the subject of strong personal attacks, but in a lesser degree against the signatories of the Treaty of London, who are accused of failing to give Italy their full support. The President is accused of attempting to regain, at Italy&apos;s expense, the prestige he has lost by sacrificing a large part of his principles under pressure from Great Britain, France, and the Republican Party. The Presidents message, issued at a time when negOtia-tions were still in progress towards a settlement, is described as an intolerable insult which makes retreat impossible.On the 24th a demonstration passed off without disorder, though the British flag outside the Y.M.C.A. was torn down. Signor Orlando&apos;s arrival in Rome on the 26th was the occasion of a second demonstration by vast crowds. Speaking from the top of his motor car the Prime Minister said that they might find themselves after four years of sacrifice again faced with fresh sacrifices and privations, but that he felt sure the Italian people would respond worthily to any sacrifices required of them. The popular attitude apparently changed in Great Britain&apos;s favour, since the crowd on its return from the station stopped at the British Headquarters and cheered the flag.Similar demonstrations took place at Turin, Genoa, and Alexandria. The whole Press, except the extreme Socialist, approves the action of the Italian delegates. Attacks are at present confined to President Wilson personally, and England and the other Allies are generally criticised in moderate terms. The Messagero deprecates further demonstrations pending Parliaments decision and hopes that M. Clemeaceau and Mr. Lloyd George will show a juster appreciation of Italy&apos;s part in the war. The annexation of Fiume must only be obtained through the Peace Conference. LJclia Nazionale, on the other hand, advocates immediate annexation of the territories claimed by Italy.   The Tempo and the Tribuna are exceptions to the generally moderate
criticism of England. France and England are accused of sordid commercial and financial motives in the Adriatic, and reference is made to Indian peasants and Egyptian nationalists &quot; whom England is preparing, as is her custom, to bind to the cannoiTs mouth in order to blow their mangled bodies into the air.&quot;The French Government has issued an official statement disclaiming responsibility for President Wilson&apos;s action.Telegrams from Fiume published in the Italian Press (April 26th) announced that in consequence of the news from Paris, the National Council had unanimously decided to consign the city to General Grazioli, the Italian Governor, and had reaffirmed the unshakable will of the people of Fiume to be united to Italy.General Grazioli requested the Council to continue the administration of the city, pending the Italian Governments decision (Mr. Eskine, April 24th to 28th).According to the latest telegrams (April 30th), the Senate voted unanimously in &quot;support of the Government, while the Chamber cast 3S2 votes for the Government as against 40 Socialist votes.PORTUGAL.Industrial Unrest. Sir L. Carnegie reports that strikes are prevalent and the labour situation, chiefly attributable to the rise in the cost of living, gives cause for uneasiness. The Minister of Labour, an ultra-Socialist who is prepared to support the workmen&apos;s exaggerated demands, is the controlling force in a weak Government. The Army is unreliable.SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Montenegro. Sir C. des Graz reports that the Serbian Government refuses to comply with General Franchet d&apos;Esperey&apos;s order for the evacuation of Montenegro (vide Report No. 116, page 4) on the ground that Montenegro has been reunited to Serbia as a component part of her national territory.Albania. With regard to the proposed withdrawal of British troops from Italy and the Adriatic coast, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs has presented a Note to Lord Derby emphasising the importance of retaining contingents representing all the Allies at Scutari and thus maintaining the Powers&apos; international status pending the final decision of the Peace Conference as to its future (Lord Derby, April 23rd).Jugo-Slavia and Hungary. M. Valyi, the editor of the Revue Politique Inter na-tionale, alleges that the Serbs are carrying on an energetic campaign in Hungary, among those classes who are opposed to the Bolshevik Government, in favour of the union of Hungary and Jugo-Slavia under the Zarageorgovitch dynasty. This campaign is said to be meeting with a certain amount o  success, since the Hungarians, to whom the appeal is being made, are in so desperate a position that they are ready to accept any solution. A federation would also give Hungary access to the sea (Lord Acton, April 24th).French Enterprise. The Banquo Franco-Serbe is backing several French firms, prominent among which is the Societe Franco-Serbe d&apos;Enterprises Industrielles et de Travaux Publics. The latter company was established in Serbia in 1912 for the purpose of obtaining railway, port, and dock concessions, &amp;c. Plans are also being-formed for the import of French goods both by rail direct from Paris and via Braila and the Danube. The Banque Franco-Serbe is about to establish a special steamship line from Marseilles and to open branches in the more important Jugo-Slav towns (Sir C. des Graz, April 22nd).UNITED STATES.President Wilson and Fiume. The Presidents attitude with regard to Italy&apos;s claims to Fiume is approved both by the Democrats and the Opposition, who, though criticising his methods, admit the justice of his policy (Lord Reading, April 26th).The attitude generally adopted by the Press is that the President is justified in making a firm stand against secret treaties upon which Italy&apos;s claims are based, since not only Italy but also Japan demands recognition on this basis. On the question of Italy&apos;s rights to Fiume the Press is much divided (Lord Reading, April 29th).
Considerable indignation has been aroused not only in the Press but in official circles by the report winch appeared originally in the Hearst papers^that Mr. Lloyd George and M. Cleinenceau approved the Presidents statement concerning Fiume a fortnight prior to its publication (Lord Reading, April 29th).Arms for Russia. The representative of the Omsk Government is endeavouring to effect the purchase of a number of rifles, but at present, owing to the difficulty of obtaining satisfactory guarantees for payment, the United States Government does not favour ids proposals (Lord Reading, April 26th).ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Hangar;/. Admiral Tronbridge has been informed that the situation at Budapest is critical, and that the Hungarians are incapable of offering resistance to the Rumanian invasion. Bela Fun is said to be in favour of a more moderate Socialist policy. Two thousand arrests have been made and some 20 bourgeois executed (Sir C. des Graz, April 26th).The Korr Bureau reports that the People&apos;s Commissary Szamuely has been appointed Commander of the Commission behind the front. The duties of this Commission will be to suppress all counter-revolutionary movements in the war zone and to secure order and discipline among the civilian population and the troops (Budapest, April 28th).German-Austria. Dr. Lammasch has again appealed for the despatch of Allied troops to Vienna. He stated that, according to information received from the Vice-President of the International Red Cross Committee, the situation was desperate and the troops, who had practically formed themselves into a Red Guard, were uncontrollable. Strong feeling existed against the Italian occupation of South Tyrol (Lord Acton, April 27th).GERMANY.Political Situation. (1) General. Sir C. Marling has received information to the effect that the strength of the military party, of which Prince Henry of Prussia is the real leader, is steadily increasing. Their work is conducted through two societies, the &quot;Bund der Kaiser-Treuen&quot; and the &quot;New Deutschland.&quot; Sir C. Marling&apos;s informant also asserts that the military party possesses the sympathy of the majority of the population, and that the German Government has more troops at its disposal than is necessary for the maintenance of internal order.Sir W. Townley learns that, according to the German Minister at The Hague, food shortage is the cause of the sporadic outbursts of the Spartacists, who otherwise could be easily suppressed by the Government.Professor Halm of Freiburg is reported to have expressed the following views with the consent of various members of the Baden and Wurttemberg Governments. A further spread of Bolshevism would be inevitable if the peace conditions were too severe, and if the interest on war loans was either reduced below 4 per cent, or completely abolished. But whatever might happen, the Governments of Baden, Wurttemberg, and Hesse, winch derived their power from the people themselves, were determined to oppose communism and the Council system. They could dispose of a considerable number of reliable volunteer troops. Both Baden and Wurttemberg, though loyal to the Empire, were prepared temporarily to secede if Bolshevism gained a footing in the rest of Germany. Professor Halm concluded by enquiring if they could rely upon British and American aid in obtaining food supplies in such an eventuality (Lord Acton, April 24th).(The following notes, unless otherwise stated, are taken from German Wireless reports, the dates of which are given in brackets.)(2) Bavaria. The situation at Munich has not undergone any material change, though Government troops are reported to be closing in on the town.   Herr Noske0   For the BtatiAs and attitude of the Hearst papers, see previous IF.ports.       ,* (Initialled).   G.G.A.
has assumed command of the troops operating against Munich (April 27th). The Red Guard is said to number 30,000 men (April 25th).According to information received by Lord Acton, Bela Kim, during his visit to Munich, was instrumental in bringing about and helping to finance the revolution.(3) Ruhr District. Strikes are abating, though Dusseldorf remains a cent reof unrest (April 25th).(4) Hanover. Disturbances have occurred leading to clashes between the police and the mob (April 25th).(5) Saxony. A slate of siege has been proclaimed in order to ensure the maintenance of public security. The general strike, however, has not so far materialised (April 25th and 27th).&apos;(6) Bremen.-The general strike is nearly over (April 27th).&quot;The Peace Terms.-According to the German Minister at The Hague, who is believed to have spoken with full knowledge of Count Brockdorff-Rantzau&apos;s views, the German Government, in the event of the Peace terms being considered unacceptable, would endeavour to conclude separate agreements with individual Powers. The questions of the Kiel Canal, the Saar Valley, and the Polish rights to the navigation of the Vistula and to a portion of the Danzig harbour should be susceptible of an amicable settlement. The Government, however, insisted on the Saar Valley remaining under German political control and attached great importance to the retention of the East African colonies (Sir W. Townley, April 25th).Relaxation of the Blockade. The following extracts are taken from a Note issued by the General Staff advocating the relaxation of the blockade of Germany (G.T. 7149) :-&quot; At the present time the national spirit of Germany appears to be completely crushed, and the existing Government is extremely unlikely to attempt to contest the will of the Allies by force of arms. The maintenance of this Government is conse-quently a primary interest to the Allies, but its position is weak, and unless it can alleviate the terrible conditions existing in a large portion of Germany, its fall is practically certain. This would be disastrous from every point of view, since it would be succeeded by a Government, or absence of Government, which not, only would be incapable of carrying out the Allied terms, but which in all probability would have not tlie slightest desire to do so. By precipitating the fall of the present Government we should throw Germany into the arms of the Bolsheviks and so give the Soviet Government of Russia a fresh lease of life. The days of the latter appear to be numbered, and the only thing which can save it is the exploitation of fresh territory.&quot; Looking still further ahead, it would directly assist the exploitation of Russia by Germany and the conclusion of an alliance between those two Powers, which presents the greatest menace to the future peace of the world, and which it is the main object of His Majesty&apos;s Government to prevent. It must be recognised, therefore, that any small advantages to be gained from the French point of view by a continuation of the blockade in its present form ,are infinitesimal compared with the danger of assisting Germany to go Bolshevik and so precipitating a general conflagration in Europe.&quot; It may be added that the partial raising of the blockade does not necessarily prevent its re-imposition in a modified form at any future date. Once the German economic machine has commenced to function, the threat of even a partial restriction would be greater than a more efficient blockade at the present time, when the machinery is completely stopped and when the population is on the verge of despair.For the above reasons, the General Staff are strongly of opinion that no time should be lost in relaxing the present restrictions, not only with the object of improving the present deplorable conditions existing in Germany, but also to give to the German people some hope for the future, which alone can enable the more stable elements to make head against Bolshevism.&quot;The League of Nations. The following outline of the German scheme for a League of Nations is published in the German Wireless Reports of April 24th :- The German Governments proposals for a League of Nations differ in certain important features from the Paris draft of February 14th, 1919.The German scheme comprises all belligerent States as well as all neutral States who subscribed to the Hague Convention. A majority decision of the members of the League is necessary for the participation of other States.
Y&quot;:.     :::: &apos; iAs regards the domestic life of nations, only in the case of national minorities is the right provided to call on the League for the protection of the rights of language, religion, &amp;c.The authorities of the League will he the world parliament and the Congress of States. The Congress of States will consist of representatives of all Governments with equal rights. The Congress is the chief administrative authority and performs its duties by means of competent committees.In the case of the most important Jaws and the budget of the League, sanction of the world parliament is necessary. The form of the world parliament has only been provisionally settled, as the first one will be elected from among the parliaments of the individual States. One representative will he elected for every million inhabitants, but no parliament may send more than 10 representatives in all.&quot;Two permanent bodies will he formed, viz., an international tribunal and a department for mediation. The tribunal will decide the legal points at issue. The department of mediation will decide conflicts of interests.All difference between States must be brought before both authorities.Each of the two authorities, i.e., the international tribunal and the department for mediation, will consist of: 15 members.The members of the former will be elected by means of a &quot; roster,&quot; those of the latter by means of indirect election, in which each State will have equal rights. The department for mediation has the special right to bring pressing questions at issue before the council for the purpose of finding a solution before the tension has developed into a conflict.Measures have been taken as regards disarmament on land and sea and in the air. Except for the purpose of coast defence, there are to be no armed ships at sea, except for the policing of the seas by the League. Straits and canals are to be international.The air is to be free for aircraft of all nations. Provisions are also made regarding the freedom of communication by cable and wireless.Economic freedom renders impossible every form of economic war which is not ordered by the League as a coercive measure. Free export and import is laid down.A special convention is added to the German draft to deal with the international rights of labour, which goes further than the equivalent draft recently published in Paris.Amendments to the Constitution. The following amendments have been passed by the Constitution Committee : -Article 20 (in case of objection raised by the Reichsrat to a law passed by the Reichstag).In case of such objection the law will be again submitted to the Reichstag. If this fails to lead to agreement between the two Houses the Imperial President can within three months order a referendum on the subject at issue. If the Reichstag decides by a two-thirds majority against the objection of the Reichsrat the President can within three months publish the law in the form accepted by the Reichstag. If he makes no use of this right the law is held to be rejected. On the demand of the Reichsrat the President must order a referendum if the two Houses fail to reach an agreement and the law in question involves a change in the Constitution.Article 30. All inhabitants of the Empire enjoy full freedom of belief, conscience and the right of State protection in the undisturbed exercise of their religion. No one is required to make his religious convictions public.No one is to be compelled to participate in any ecclesiastical proceeding or ceremony or any religious service, or to employ any religious formula of oath-taking. Civic rights and admission to public office are entirely independent of religious status.Article 30a. There exists no State Church. Freedom of religious association is guaranteed.Every religious society regulates and administers its own affairs independently. Sundays and State recognised festivals will continue to be observed. In hospitals, prisons, &amp;c, religious needs may be supplied by religious societies, but without any compulsion, vHarvest Statistics. According to statistics published by the Berlin Borsenzeitung, between 1913 and 1918 the wheat harvest in Germany dropped from 44 to 21- million
tons. In the same period the rye harvest dropped from 12 to S million tons, the barley harvest from 3i to 21 million tons, and the oats harvest from 91- to 44- million tons.Secret Service. Lord Acton learns that comprehensive measures have been decided upon by the German Government for reorganising the secret service system in Allied countries.   German agents are stated to be in Paris.Engineering Commission. The Engineering Commission will commence its inspection of German factories in the zone of occupation on May 7th (Foreign Office, April 26th).neutral group.ARGENTINA.Labour Situation.--A want of confidence in shipping and a feeling of unrest in labour circles is prevalent. Work is being carried out in the port of Buenos Ayres, but the boycott is being practised. Strikes are also on the increase in other businesses (Sir R. Tower, April 25th).BALTIC PROVINCES.Military Situation. The general position remains unchanged, but fierce fighting is reported to have taken place both on the southern and eastern fronts, the Holsheviks claiming successes in the neighbourhood of Petchori and Marienburg. An Esthonian report (April 26th) ascribes the renewed vigour of the Bolshevik offensive to the events at Libau. Latest reports (Moscow, Aprif 2lt\\) state that the Red Lettish troops have launched an offensive oh a front of 40 versts in the neighbourhood of Yolmar and have occupied a number of places north-west of Valk and Ruen.The coup aVelat at Libau. The situation is still uncertain. General von der Goltz acknowledged that the troops under his command had acted in a lawless manner and promised to accede to the Head of the American Missioids demand, made in agreement with the Allied representatives, to send away the offending unit. He refused, however, to dismiss its commander, who was stated to have a good record of service.After an unsuccessful attempt had been made to persuade the Commander of the Lettish troops and Prince Lieven, Commander of the Russian Corps, to form a military dictatorship, it appeared likely that the Lettish Government would resume office, but sentries from Baron von ManteufeLs unit were found posted at the place of assembly. In Mr. Grant VVatson&apos;s opinion General von der Goltz has no intention of allowing the re-establishment of the former Government. Meanwhile the Baltic Party, with the assistance of some pro-German Letts, succeeded in forming a Cabinet,, which in its turn was unable to assume office owing to the hostility of the population.The American Mission has dispatched an officer to Paris to urge the importance of defining more closely the duties of the Germans in Latvia and of providing financial assistance to the Letts (Mr. Grant Watson, April 22nd to 26th).A note has been presented to the German delegates at Spa on behalf of the British Government demanding the restoration of the Lettish Government and its freedom of action, especially with regard to the enlistment of Lettish troops (General Raking, April 23rd).The German Government has informed the Esthouian representative at Copeu-hagen that it does not support the Baltic Barons and that the coup was made without its knowledge. A German Mission has been sent to Libau to discover how far General von der Goltz and the German Legation are implicated (Sir C. Marling, April 27th).Esthonia. Mr. Bosanquet (Reval) gives a revised list; of the results of the elections (vide Report No. 1.1.6, page 9) as follows: Social Democrats, 41; Labour; 30; Peoples&apos; Party, 25 ; Agrarians, 8 ; Social Revolutionaries, 7 ; Christian Peoples&apos; Party, 5 ; Germans, 3 ; Russians, 1.
The Social Democratic Party appears to be in favour of the confiscation of the Baron&apos;s estates without compensation, and of the conclusion of peace with the Soviet Government in the near future (Mr. Bosanquet, April 25th).The Prime Minister, Mr. Pacts, states that the Hungarian Government has offered to mediate between Esthonia and the Bolsheviks. The morale of the troops is affected, and Mr. Bosanquet thinks that a definite declaration of Allied policy &quot;coupled with material aid is the only means of averting a crisis.LUXEMBURG.The Referendum. The following information is taken from a Memorandum (G.T., 7129) drawn up hy the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office on the Referendum in Luxemburg : &quot; The population of Luxemburg was in 1910 nearly 260,000, of whom only about 3,300 were Protestants and 1,200 Jews ; tbe great majority, therefore, is Catholic, at any rate in denomination. The Court and its hangers-on are very much under the -influence of pro-Germau ultra-montane clericals. A minority of the people (Socialists and Liberal Left Wing, plus a small group of intellectuals of French culture) is Republican, and most of the Republicans favour political union with France. The main body of Liberals is Monarchist, but clearly realises that the dominant factors in Luxemburg policy must be (1) the economic future of the country, and (2) the necessity of remaining on good terms with the Allied Powers. They are prepared to sacrifice the dynasty, to accept &apos; personal union&apos; with Belgium under Iving Albert as Grand Duke, and to decide the question of economic orientation strictly on economic grounds. The desire for autonomy is strong in all classes and parties, and this desire, it seems, is being exploited by the present Government or perhaps it would be truer to say by the- present Minister of State in order to maintain the ascendency of the Clerical Party.&quot; The aim of the Government in the referendum seems to be to create a fait accompli before the Allies make a definite declaration against the dynasty. They have meanwhile done their best to get it believed (1) that the independence of the country stands or falls with the dynasty ; and (2) that the dynasty and the Government enjoy the favour of the Allies. They believe that if the referendum can be taken before any declaration on the part of the Allies comes to falsify their representation of the position, the voting will be in favour of maintaining the dynastj7, since many Luxemburgers, though hostile to the present Grand Duchess, are in favour of monarchical government, fearing that the establishment of a republic would sooner or later mean incorporation with France.&quot;The leading liberals strongly urge the postponement of the Referendum until the country has before it the facts which really condition its future, viz., (1) the feelings of the Allied Governments about the rejection or maintenance of the Nassau dynasty; (2) the balance of economic advantages between the Belgian and French connection. They are convinced that if it were known before the referendum that the Allies desire the removal of the dynasty the monarchical parties, who greatly outnumber the republicans, would rally towards personal union with Germany.From the economic aspect the mining interests and the vine-growers are said to favour the Belgian connection, the agriculturalists the French connection.The plebiscite is at present fixed for May 4th.According to a telegram received on April 29th from Luxemburg, after an imposing procession through the streets, a vast mass meeting unanimously passed a resolution appealing to the Peace Conference and the Governments of the Allies to observe the liberties of small nations and demanding the right to enter the League of Nations and to- dispose freely of the political and economic future of Luxemburg &quot;through the referendum to the whole people.NETHERLANDS.Political Situation. Less anxiety has recently been shown by Catholic and official circles with regard to the political situation in the immediate future. The Catholic Party&apos;s programme for co-operative association between capital and labour has been well received.7994-1!)0
The Social Democratic La hour Congress, which opened at Arnhem on April 20th, Tinanimously passed a series of resolutions, which were not, however, as revolutionary as might have been expected under present conditions. Mr. Troelstra&apos;s speech was not convincing (Sir W. Townley, April 23rd).SWEDEN.Recognition of Russian Slates. Mr. Clive learns from the Secretary-General that while the Swedish Government has definitely recognised Finland, it intends to act in unison with Denmark and Norway with regard to recognition of the other States which formerly composed part of the old Russian Empire.
