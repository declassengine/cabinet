WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Bolshevism as a World Force. The Chief of the General Stall&apos; has put forward a comprehensive report with map (P. 98, January 12th) upon Bolshevism, from the political, economic and military point of view, with estimates of the forces at its disposal, and prospects of its spreading beyond the boundaries of Russia. The deduction is arrived at that, conditions in Germany should be stabilised with a view to keeping the infection as far to the eastward as possible. The Chief of the Naval Staff (First Sea Lord) on January 13th put forward a Memorandum (P. 95) dealing with the same question from a naval point of view (see also under &quot; Peace Discussions, General.&quot; Russian Bolshevism, as an internal question, is not dealt with in this Report.)Mr. Ovey learns that Mr. Ludwig Meyer, who, if he is not the actual Bolshevik representative in Norway, is at least working on behalf of Vorovski and Litvinoff, wishes to publish Bolshevik peace proposals. The terms include the following clauses : (1) No general compensation is to be demanded ; (2) the Russian frontier is not to be regulated ; (3) the future of small States to be settled on the basis of self-determination ; (4) the Bolshevik Government agrees to the payment of compensation for foreign property and securities in Russia ; (5) no reprisals will be taken on Russians who have joined the Allies ; (6) universal suffrage and the freedom of the Press will be gradually introduced ; (7) abstention from interference in the internal affairs of other countries.Mr. Robertson has been informed that Ministers are being sent by the Persian Government to Stockholm, Berne, and The Hague. They will act as Bolshevik agents and will draw funds from a Bolshevik source, in Stockholm.Repatriation of Prisoners. The lat esfreport of the Inter-departmental Committee on Prisoners of War states that 7,111 officers, 150,218 other ranks, and 4,624 civilians haAre been repatriated since the date of the armistice.The Netherlands Minister at Berlin has been assured by the German Foreign Offi ce that no secret camps exist in Germany.Trade Restrictions. The President of the Board of Trade has drawn up a Memorandum (G.T. 6682) describing the serious effects produced on British trade by the restrictions placed on the export of practically all articles to neutral European countries. The Memorandum points out - that at a time when every possible encouragement should be given to the revival and expansion of trade in order to maintain employment, to improve exchange, and to secure the trade formerly in German hands, every sort of discouragement is placed in the way of British manufacturers ami traders who are desirous of carrying on trade with a very important group of markets. The Board of Trade therefore recommends that a list of the articles in respect of which restrictions must be retained should be substituted for the present limited list of articles in respect of -which they have been dropped.ALLIED GROUP.CHINA.Coolies in Russia. The Allied Powers have been requested to give their Approval to a Note which it is proposed should be sent to His Majesty&apos;s representative at Peking. Phe Note points out that the Bolshevik Government has enlisted some ten to twenty thousand coolies, who formerly worked behind the Russian lines, in their armies. These coolies have been used partly to carry out the Bolshevik policy of devastation and partly as executioners. Sir J. Jordan is instructed to urge the Chinese Government to demand of the Bolshevik Government their immediate release from service and their repatriation to China.
CUBA.Internal Unrest. The United States Charge d&apos;Affaires at Havana, after a-conference with His Majesty&apos;s representative, has sent a despatch to his Government in which he points out the necessity of making strong representation to the Cuban Government. The latter has shown considerable weakness both in dealing with the labour situation, which is likely to lead to the curtailment of the Porto Rico sugar crop, and in releasing interned enemy prisoners without consulting the Allies. Mr. Cowan suggests that Cuban representation at the Peace Conference should be made dependent upon the adoption of strong measures to ensure the cessation of the present labour agitation. A delegate, however, has already been allotted to Cuba. Mr. Barclay has been informed that the State Department has taken precautionary measures in conjunction with the Naval authorities to deal with any situation which may arise.On January 17th Mr. Cowan reported that a strike had been declared by the employees of the United Railways of Havana which had resulted in the suspension of the entire railway service in that parr, of the island. There was also a builders&apos; strike in Havana, and other unions were in a state of agitation.FRANCE.Parliamentary Session. Lord Derby reports that the Senate and Chamber of Deputies met on January loth for the. opening of the 1919 Parliamentary Session. Principal interest centred in the election of the President of the Senate, since the names of several candidates had been mentioned as likely to be put forward in opposition to M. Dubost, who has been President since 190G. M. Dubost was, however, re-elected by 98 Arotes as against 66 votes given to M. de Selves. M. Deschanel was re-elected President of the Chamber of Deputies by 301 votes out of 330.Socialist Federation of the Seine. Lord Derby states that a meeting of this Socialist group was held on January 12th in connection with the acceleration of demobilisation. The meeting was dominated by the extremists. Lenin, Trotsky, and Longuet were noisily acclaimed. On M. Laval, who was one of the speakers, remarking that it would be an insult to French democracy to believe it capable of Bolshevism, the tumult became so great that M. Renaudel and the Parliamentary Socialists could no longer make themselves heard. M. Pericat, who represented the extreme section, accused the Confederation Generale du Travail of treason to its class and urged the people to follow the Russian example.Lord Derby, while recognising the advantage of not attaching too much importance to the extreme elements, thinks that there are three questions which can be used by agitators to promote disaffection : (1) the high cost of living, (2) the lamentable conditions prevailing in the Northern liberated districts owing to the alleged failure of the Government to cope with tire difficulties of transport, (3) demobilisation.ITALY.The New Cabinet. On January 16th Signor Orlando reconstructed the Cabinet as follows:  Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior    -   Signor Orlando. Foreign Affairs   - - - -   Baron Sonnino.Colonies   - -   Signor Colosimo.Treasury - - - -   Signor Stringher.Finance - Signor Meda.Justice - - - -   Signor Facta.Food Supplies - Signor Crespi.Agriculture - - -       . -   Signor Riccio.Commerce and Industry  - Signor Ciufelli.Public Works       - - - -   Signor Bonorai.Public Instruction - Signor Berenini.Posts and Telegraphs - - -   Signor Fera.War  - - - - -   General calviglia.Marine  - - ...   Vice-Admiral Del Buono.Construction in liberated Provinces -   Signor Fradeletto.
Signor Nitti&apos;s successor at tlie Treasury is the manager of the Bank of Italy. Sir R. Rodd states that Signor Faeta, who was Minister of Finance in Sigouri Giolitti&apos;s last Cabinet, lias been chosen in order to counterbalance the influence of Signor Nitti and bis followers. He does not think that the new combination is one to inspire confidence, and foresees its end at no distant date.Catholic Party. The Times of January 21st published a report stating that, a new party bad been formed under the title of &quot; Parti to Popolare Italiano.&quot; This party is in effect  a Catholic Party. Its programme, however, so far from being reactionary or clerical, is said to be advanced.Pints. On January IStli Sir R. Rodd reported that riots had occurred in Milan. They were caused b3r Socialist opposition to meetings organised by patriotic societies in favour of the annexation of Fiume and Dalmatia.PORTUGAL.Political Situation. On January 16th the unconditional surrender of the revolutionaries was reported in the Portuguese Press.Sir L. Carnegie reports that the military junta proclaimed the restoration of the monarchy at Oporto on January .19th. Other towns in the north are said to be in sympathy with the movement which the Government is taking energetic measures to suppress.   There were great manifestations at Lisbon in favour of the Republic.Fling Manoefs representative has disclaimed all knoAvledge of the movement, and has shown the Government a telegram which he recently received from the King, urging his party to support the present regime until the conclusion of peace.UNITED STATES.Transport of Troops. Mr. Barclay has been informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government hopes to provide sufficient tonnage for the rexoatriation of American troops at the rate of o0,000 a mouth. Four transports have been offered to the United States Government, in addition to which the Aquitania, Mauretania, and Olympic will probably be available for the same purpose.Shipping Rales.-Information has been received that private individuals are no longer prohibited by the Shipping Board from chartering ships, and that Mr. Rossiter, the Director of Operations, has been authorised to allow such charter at rates to be determined at his own discretion. It is not yet clear how this arrangement will work, but Mr. Rossiter has declared his intention to underquote other lines. This policy is aimed at Japanese competition, and Mr. Kossiter hopes to arrive at some arrangement by which a rate-war with British companies may be avoided.ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Carman-Austria. Sir H. Rumbold learns that Dr. Bauer intends to work hard for a union between German-Austria and Germany. His informant, however, does not think that the Foreign Secretary will survive the elections, if the latter are fairly conducted.One hundred advanced Swiss Socialists are reported to be leaving Switzerland for Vienna.Bolshevism. According to the Frankfurtur Zeitung, quoted in a German Wireless report of January 8th, a number of machine guns and ammunition have been seized in the Vienna Cadet, School. The Police President has ascertained the presence of 22 Bolsheviks, who have come to A^ienna at the instance of the Soviet Government for the incitation of unrest. The Government has agreed to their expulsion.GERMANY.The Sailors&apos; Movement. Attention is drawn to a Memorandum (G.T. 6672) giving an account of the dispute between the Government and the sailors, which
immediately preceded the Spartacus revolt. Since January Gtli the sailors have been ou the side of the Government, though their real aim has doubtless been to obtain employment in Berlin. There have been similar occurrences in other parts of Germany. In Hamburg demobilised soldiers and sailors prefer the position and pay of members of the Popular Guard to civilian work. In Brunswick the revolutionary Government has been overthrown by similar elements. In Bremen the extreme section of the working classes has been systematically armed, and the returned soldiers disarmed.The Spartaens Recall. Peace has been restored in Berlin. Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg have been killed. According to the official German version they were both arrested on January loth. Liebknecht, after having been roughly handled by the crowd on his way to prison, was shot by his guards while attempting to escape. Rosa Luxemburg was lynched by a hostile crowd. The majority of the Press expresses severe disapproval of &quot;lynch law,&quot; but at the same time points out that Liebknecht is responsible for his own fate.According to a wireless report of January 18th, the Government has made the following announcement:-&quot; The strictest enquiry has been ordered. The culprits will be punished. There is no doubt that the victims have committed a crime against the German nation, but it is equally without doubt that they have a claim to the justice which punishes the guilty. The lynch law applied to Rosa Luxemburg shames the German nation.....&quot;A general strike which was called by the Social Democratic Party as a protest against the murder of the two Spartacists. found few supporters and ended on January 18th with a resumption of work.In view of the support given by the Russian Bolsheviks to the Spartacus revolt, the Germau Government has issued a strong protest to the Russian Government against their &quot;inadmissible and criminal interference in the internal conditions of Germany &quot; (German Wireless, January 20th). The number of deaths caused by the fighting in Berlin is reported to amount to 140 (German Wireless, January 19th).The Elections.- -According to German Wireless reports the elections for the Constituent Assembly were conducted quietly on January 19th. The polling booths were well attended and a strong percentage of women were among the voters. Disturbances only occurred at a few places, such as the Rhineland mining district, Hamburg, and Cassel, and these were due to acts of violence on the part of Spartacus sympathisers. The returns at present indicate a strong majority in favour of the Majority Socialists.Attention is drawn to an article which appeared in The Times of January 18th which deals with the programmes and prospects of the new parties in Germany. A further article (January 22nd) gives a list of the 38 electoral districts and the number of deputies to be elected in each.The Government is reported to have decided on Weimar as the meeting place of the National Assembly.State Assembly Elections (vide G.T. 6081). - (1) Brunswick. The voting for the State Assembly of the former Duchy of Brunswick, was as follows :--Social Democratic Party - - - .-   44,110 votes.Independent Socialists ...   42,750    ,,National Electoral Union (Parties of the Right) -   43,560    ,,Democratic Party (Non-Socialist Radicals and Liberals)   38,120 .  ,, The large number of votes polled by the Independent Socialists is in accordance with the extreme tendencies of this State, where the provisional Government has been overthrown by the local Workmen&apos;s and. Soldiers&apos; Council.(2) Bavaria. The preliminary elections for the Constituent Assembly have resulted as follows : Bavarian Peopled Party (mainly the Catholic Centre) 754,474 votes. Majority Socialists      .... 696,433    ,, German Democratic Party (Liberal-Radical Coalition) 312,182 Bavarian Peasants&apos; League (Progressive Land Re-formers)      -    ^       -            -            -         - 250,238   ,, Independent Socialists             -            -           &apos;- 87,593    ,, National Liberals          -            -            -         - 86,153    ,, Non-commissioned Officers&apos; Party (a Soviet Rump)   - 9,23(3    ,, Middle-class Party (Reactionary)   -            -         - 3,1807185- u B
The extremists have at present very little power in Bavaria, and, provided no unpopular reactionary policy is indulged in, it is probable that this Stale will be one of the most conservative and moderating elements in the future political life of Germany.(3) Wurllemberg.  Vide Report No. 102, page 5.(4) Prussia, The elections are fixed for January 20th.The Constitution. The task&apos; of drafting the new constitution has been confided to Dr. Brcuss, the State Secretary of the Borne Office, and the general outline has been agreed upon. The Government Bill is divided into four sections which deal with (!) the Empire and the German Tree States ; (2) the basic rights of the German people ; (3) the Reichstag ; (J) the President of the Empire and the Imperial Govern-ment. As a general principle the German Empire will consist of its l&apos;.ormev component States as well as territories whose population, by virtue of the right of self-determination, desire to be received into the Empire. Newly erected free States, however, must embrace at least two millions of inhabitants. . The Imperial President is to be elected by the wdiole people and will hold office for a period of seven years, lie will represent the Empire and announce the laws. The declaration of war and the conclusion of peace will be effected by the Imperial Legislature. Treaties with Foreign States wilL require the assent of the Reichstag.The Imperial Government will be composed of the Imperial Chancellor, and Imperial Ministers, who shall bo chosen by the President of the Peichstag. They must have the confidence of the House of Deputies and will be responsible to the Reichstag. Every Imperial Minister will bear independently the responsibility for his own department.NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.Strikes. The latest telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s representative at Buenos Aires show a considerable improvement in the situation. On January 16th Sir P. Tower reported that, though confidence had not been restored in the capital, owing to military intervention normal conditions were being resumed, in consequence of which the Senate had postponed consideration of the motion for a declaration of a state of siege.H.M.S. Bristol is being retained at Montevideo pending any fresh developments which might endanger the lives of British subjects.BALTIC  PROVINCES.British Saved Intervention. Attention is drawn to an Admiralty Report on the situation (P. 95). This Report deals, inter alia, with British naval intervention in the Baltic. By January 5th all the British ships had left, the Baltic ports. Though the squadron rendered material assistance to the local Governments, this assistance fell short of their expectations. In the words of the Report : &quot; Had there been a strong national spirit on which to work .... the supply of arms and the naval support by sea, which was all that the squadron alone was able to effect, would have been of great value.&quot;   (Also referred to under &quot;Peace Discussions.&quot;)Eslhonia. On January 17th Lord Kilmarnock reported that on the front east of Reval Esthonian troops had recovered Kunda, Wesenburg, and Taps. Further to the south they have reached Sirenetz, which is situated at the point where the River Narova leaves Lake Peipus. On the southern front the Esthonian army is converging on Walck from the direction of Ruen and&apos; Dorpat, both of which towns are in its hands. The Finnish General Hjalmarson states that the Bolshevik retreat resembles a panic, and that the Bolsheviks now hold only one-sixth of the country. He thinks, however, that much depends on placing Esthonia on a sound financial basis. The latest Press reports state that Narva has been re-occupied, and that the Bolsheviks are retreating southwards to Pskoff.Lord Kilmarnock reports that he has been approached by a number of Danes who wish to raise a volunteer force to fight in Esthonia.
Livonia. A Russian Wireless report states that a Congress of the Soviets of United Livonia, consisting of 520 members, was convened at Riga on January 13th under the presidency of Stutcbka. A commission was appointed, to draw up a constitution.It is reported through die same source that free and compulsory education has been introduced at Riga.Gourland. According to a Russian report, a workmen&apos;s revolt has broken out in Win dan.A Swedish Press report states that at Libau the Lettish Social Democrats have declared against the Bolsheviks. The German garrison has also commenced anti-Bolshevik operations, though Mr. Clive learns that the soldiers are strongly infected by Bolshevik propaganda.. The Commander of the British Naval Force in the Baltic has been informed that the Swedish Government awaits the approval of the British Government to send a force of 3,000 volunteers to Libau. His Majesty&apos;s Government has replied that it has no objection to this force proceeding to Esthonia to fight for the Provisional Government.The   Baltic  barons  have  given  a  million roubles to finance  the  Swedish expedition.BOLIVIA.The Tacna-Ariea. Question. The Foreign Office has received a despatch from His Majesty&apos;s representative at La Paz containing suggestions for the settlement of the Tacna-Ariea question. If Chile wire to abandon her schemes of territorial expansion by which she aims at operations in Peru by means of the Arica and Antofagasta railways, and were to cede Tacna and Arica to Peru, Peru might be induced to offer Chile equivalent compensation in the form of a favourable com-mercial treaty. Peru might then cede the two provinces to Bolivia, with whom she stands in friendly relations, in return for an increase in territory7 east of Lake Titicaca. If a settlement was reached on these lines, Bolivia would have to com-compensate Chile for the cost of the construction of the Arica-La Paz railway, which would be transferred to Bolivian control. By these measures Chile would definitely secure Antofagasta and Tarapaca, while she woidd have nothing to fear from the occupation of the two provinces by Bolivia. Peru would acquire valuable territory, and establish a fresh claim on Bolivian friendship. Bolivia would satisfy her national aspirations. Mr. Haggard points out that there are two indispensable conditions upon which an agreement can be reached, (1) participation by all of the three States concerned, and (2) supervision of the negotiations by the Allied Powers.FINLAND.Recognition. Lord Derby7 reported on January 20th that the French Government was satisfied with the measures taken by7 General Mannerheim in accordance with the programme which lie laid down during his visit to London. These measures consisted in (1) obtaining the renunciation of the throne from the Prince of Hesse ; (2) the recall of the Finnish representative at Berlin ; (3) a commission of inquiry into the army. M. Pichon was therefore prepared, jointly7 with the British govern-ment, to recognise the independence of Finland.LUXEMBURG.Abdication of the Grand Duchess. Information has been received from the Minister of State that the Luxemburg Chamber has decided, by 30 votes to 19, to nominate a delegation to receive the oath of Princess Charlotte&apos;as &quot;successor to the Grand Duchess Marie Adelaide, who abdicated on January 10th (vide Report No. 102, page 8).NETHERLANDS.Economic Agreement with Germany. Mr. Robertson states that according to a Press report which was published on January 14th, preliminary discussions regarding&quot;718o-41j 0
sa new economic agreement with Germany have commenced. The chief subject of discussion relates to what exports can be made to Germany in return for January imports of coal. The Netherlands Government has proposed that cattle should be exported to Germany at the rate of one head for every 100 tons of coal imported from Germany.   It is hoped that 40,000 tons of coal will he obtained during January.Mr. Robertson adds that Germany has been importing on an average 5,000 tons of iron material a month since October aud also sufficient salt to meet the needs of the Dutch public. Potash fields are mostly within the occupied portions of German territory.Base at Rotterdam. Mr. Robertson has been instructed to support the French Minister at The Hague in his request to the Netherlands Government to facilitate the establishment of a base at Rotterdam for provisioning via the Rhine the Allied armies of occupation in Germany.Limburg and the Scheldt.  On January 20th Mr. Robertson reported the return of the Dutch Mission from Belgium. The delegates were satisfied with the official assurances they had received with regard to Limburg and Zeeland, but gathered that an important section of Belgian public opinion was in favour of giving Holland a German coal mine and effecting the settlement of the Ems question in return for the cession of Limburg to Belgium.Mr. Robertson states that, though the Netherlands Government is ready to discuss the question of the navigation of the Scheldt, public opinion would never allow a cession of Dutch territory. Moreover, Limburg is the main stronghold of the Catholic party which is now in power.*NORWAY.Bolshevism. Mr. Ovey reports that the only action so far taken by the Norwegian Government to combat Bolshevism has been to instruct Banks to abstain from changing any large sums of roubles which may be presented to them; On the other hand Mr. Ovey learns from the Bank of Norway that no measures have been taken with regard to such transactions.The Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs has been very reticent about Bolshevik activities, but Mr. Ovey understands that no person can enter Norway from Sweden or Denmark without reference to the Government. No Bolsheviks, however, have been expelled from the country owing to the fact that their behaviour has apparently been reasonable. The Minister of Justice is endeavouring to reach some arrangement for the co-operation of British officials in anti-Bolshevik measures.SPAIN.Enemy Shipping. Sir A. Hardinge reports that the United States Ambassador has been instructed to inform the Spanish Government that the Associated Governments propose to employ Austro-Hungarian ships lying in Spanish ports for the purpose of revictualling distressed regions&quot;.SWEDEN.Bolshevism. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Mr. Clive that M. Yorovski, the Bolshevik representative in Sweden, M. Litvinoff, and all the Bolshevik Missions in Sweden will be sent back to Russia in the near future. The Finnish Government has agreed to allow their passage through Finland.It is possible that M. Litvinoff may be allowed to proceed to Norway, but Mr. Clive has pointed out the undesirability of such a course, and the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs is taking up the matter with the Norwegian Government.SWITZERLAND.The Presidents Visit to Paris. The President of the Republic has signified his intention of paying an unofficial visit to Paris in order to meet the principal Allied Prime Ministers.    He informed Sir H. Rumbold that the time had. come when
Switzerland should modify her detached attitude with regard to external affairs. Sir H. Rumbold assumes that the navigation of the Rhine and of the Rhone are the chief questions which the President wishes to discuss.The Aland Islands. Mr. Clive reports that all parties in Sweden agree that so long, as General Mannerheim is in power in Finland, a favourable solution of the Aland question is unlikely. Me learns from His M.ajesty&apos;s representative at Helsingfors that both the Swedish Minister and Mr. Branting, who is an advocate of annexation, are in close touch with the Finnish Socialists, who are expected to gain a large number of seats in the coming elections. The Socialists, however, are thought to be as equally opposed as General Mannerheim to the cession of the islands.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.(N.B.  Countries are arranged in alphabetical order under this heading.)General. The following papers, referred to in former Reports, have now been printed : Mr. Long&apos;s Memorandum on disposal of the German Colonies (P. 89) and the future of Cyprus (P. 90).

Marshal Foch was authorised to take the necessary measures to give effect to the recommendation of the experts in this subject, either by the insertion of a clause in the Armistice, or otherwise.   It was decided, in order to complete the execution of clause NXIL of the Armistice, to lay clown as an interpretation of that clause that all submarines which can proceed to sea or be towed are to be surrendered immediately, and to proceed forthwith to Allied ports.   Submarine-cruisers and mine-layers, and submarine lifting vessels and docks are to be included.   Those submarines which cannot be surrendered are to be totally destroyed.   Submarine building is to cease forthwith, and. those submarines which are now under construction are to be broken up.   An agreement was come to on the questions   of   utilisation  of   German merchant shopping, the supply of food on repayment, the return by Germany of machinery and other stolen goods, and the delivery by Germany of interned and prize ships.
