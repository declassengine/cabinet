appropriate-EOJATIQN  OF THE ATTACHED  WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 130.General. One of the subjects of chief interest during the past week has been Herr ErzbergePs speech in the National Assembly, and subsequent disclosures and statements made by public men in Germany and other countries. In so far as these affect British policy in 1917, extracts from information received, which has not appeared in the British Press, are given under Austria, France, Germany, and in the Appendix.Austria (page 2). Count Czernin proposes to publish a book, and to make further disclosures following upon those by Herr Erzberger.China (page 2). A report bearing upon Japanese policy is given under this heading. For the attitude of the United States of America on the Shantung settlement under the terms of the Peace Treaty with Germany, see page 7.Denmark (page 3). The Government is showing some interest in the inde-pendence from German influence of the voters in Slesvig.Finland (page 3). Professor Stahlberg has been elected President by a large majority over the votes given for General Mannerheim.France (page 3). The Echo de Paris account of an interview with M. Ribot, and the amended statement (see Appendix) communicated to the Temps, are of special interest.Germany (page 4). Herr ErzbergeFs speech to the National Assembly has created widespread interest, and there seems to be some prospect of further disclosures which will prove from German sources the truth about German policy, and fix responsibility.   Herr Erzberger is reported to have gained in influence.A wireless statement on the German Mercantile Marine deserves attention.Hungary (page 5). The attack upon the Rumanians does not appear to have met with the success claimed.Norway (page-7). A desire to join the League of Nations is indicated.Peace Discussions (page 8). The summary of information received from Paris is continued from former Reports.G. G. A.July 31st, 1919;SECRET.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.AUSTRIA.Resignation of the Foreign Secretary. In announcing the resignation of Dr. Bauer, German Wireless (July 26th) adds: &quot; With the resignation of Bauer a new orientation of Austrian policy will commence.&quot;Count Czernin. According to wireless reports, Count Czernin proposes shortly to issue a book on the world war dealing clearly with all political events in which he was concerned, and including documentary evidence in support of his statements. He describes the facts discussed by Erzberger as only links in a chain of irresponsible political intrigues (July 2Sth).THE BALTIC STATES.Rolling Stock. The Supreme Economic Council is taking steps to arrange for the despatch through Poland of locomotives and wagons. The arrangement for Germans to leave locomotives and rolling stock in the Baltic States as part of the material due to the Allies has been dropped (Astoria, July 21st).Latvia,. The British Government has recognised the Provisional Government of Latvia as a de facto Government (Foreign Office, July 24th).Marshal Foch has renewed his demand to the German Armistice Commission about the evacuation of Latvia hy German troops, and has demanded that the necessary instructions shall be sent at once to the German military authorities (Astoria, July 21st).Proposed Conference. According to information received from Helsingfors via Stockholm there is to be a Conference in Esthonia between representatives of Esthonia, Finland, Lettland, Lithuania, and Poland to discuss the question of joint action to be taken to maintain their independence (Stockholm, July 25th).BRAZIL.Neio Cabinet. On July 28th the President assumed his office and took the oath. A new departure has been made in giving the Ministries of Marine and of War to civilians (Sir A. Peel, July 29th). The following is a list of the new Government, as published in the Times : Senhor Alredo Pinto (Jurisconsult) Senhor Azevedo Marques (Professor of the Facultyof Law at Sao Paulo)      -Senhor Homero Baptista (at present President ofthe Bank of Brazil) ...Senhor Pires do Rio (Civil Engineer) Senhor Simoes Lories - - -Senhor Raul Soares (at present Secretary for theInterior of the State of Minas Geraes) Senhor  Pandia  Calogeras  (one   of   the   PeaceDelegates) -Interior. Foreign Affairs. Finance.Communications. Agriculture.Marine.War.CHILE.Instructors for the Army. Mr. Vaughan (Santiago) on July 23rd raised the question of sending British Army instructors to replace the former German instructors in the Chilean Army.Control of Railways. According to a report from the Military Attache forwarded by Sir J. Jordan on July 24th, movements of troops have taken place in the Kirin province which resulted practically in leaving the defence of the Chinese Eastern
Railway to Japanese troops, and the eventual occupation of that railway by the Japanese was considered probable unless a portion of it could be allotted to American troops. A later report (July 27th) states that the railway beyond the present terminus at Fengchen will have been extended to the northwards for 50 miles hv December.DENMARK.Slesvig. On July 24th Lord Ivihnarnock reported on good authority that the Danish Departments were prepared to supply foodstuffs to the first and second zones in Slesvig as soon as the Administration was&apos; taken over by the Commission, lie further reported that supply trains from the south will undoubtedly cease running on the evacuation by the Germans.On the same date Lord Kilmarnock reported that he had been asked by the Danish Foreign Minister whether it was true that a British Naval Force and landing part3r were proceeding to Flensborg. The Foreign Minister added that the Danish Government would be glad to make an announcement to that effect.On July 25th a deputation visited Lord Kilmarnock from Sonderborg to report that seamen of the German Navy in Kiel were terrorising the town, and that the German Military Authorities refused to intervene when asked for protection. The deputation asked for help from the Entente.The Ohairman of the Committee and Delegates of the North Slesvig Electors Union communicated to Lord Kilmarnock on July 24th the following resolution passed by the Union on July 5th :  &quot; Delegates as a body express their gratitude to Members of Danish Rigsdag for appeals they have made to Minister for Foreign Affairs to have him negotiate to have third zone in Schleswig cleared of German officials and troops. In order to ensure absolutely freedom aud independence in second zone it is essential and necessary that territory cleared and evacuated extends further than a few kilometres south of Flensborg.&quot;The Chairman further expressed his hope that the ratification of the Peace Treaty would not be long delayed because the harvest would soon be ready and the Germans were preparing to requisition it as soon as it was cut. A law was already in print, and would be rushed through the Reichstag, imposing immediate heavy taxation upon Slesvig, -which would result in despoiling the region before it could be handed over to Denmark.According to the same authority the recent food riots at Haderslev&apos; were largely due to the fact that Flensborg had been lavishly provided with provisions by the German Government, whilst there was a serious shortage in the first zone.Attitude of the Riksdag.-On July 20th Lord Kilmarnock reported that the leaders of the Conservative people&apos;s party and of the Liberal Left had asked for a closed sitting of the Riksdag to enable the Minister for Foreign Affairs to explain what he has done to secure freedom of voting in second zone, and evacutiou by Germans of third zone. In reply the Prime Minister pointed out that information had already been given to the party leaders and sees no objection. He proposed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should answer questions in open session, and notice of interpellation had accordingly been given by opposition leaders.FINLAND.Election of President. On July 26th Mr. Bell (Helsingfors) reported that Professor Stahlberg had been elected President of Finland by a large majority against General Mannerheim. It was not considered probable that this would influence the foreign policy of Finland to the detriment of British policy. According to later Press reports General Mannerheim has been appointed Commander-in-Chief.Blockade of Germany. The French representative at Helsingfors was informed by his Government on July 11th that the blockade was to be raised from July 12th. (Astoria, July 28th).FRANCE.Anglo-French Treaty. Sir G. Grahame on July 22nd drew attention to a leading article in the Te mps welcoming&apos;the fact that the &quot;Defence of France Bill&quot; passed through the House of Commons in three successive readings without a ballot.
British Attitude in 1917. In commenting on statements by Here Erzberger and &quot;Monsignor Pacelli (Papal Nuncio at Munich), the Figaro of July 28th drew attention to an article in the Hamburger Nachrichten stating that in August 1917 the British Prime Minister had ceased to believe in victory. The Figaro added that the impression must not get about that EnglancFs determination to carry on the Avar Avas Aveakeuing at that time, or that, together Avith France, she asked Germany to state her conditions and the guarantees which she would accept (Sir G. Grahame, -July 28th). In a Press interview given to the Echo de Paris, M. Ribot, who was President of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs Avhen Monsignor PacehYs letter was written (August 1917), was represented to have made the following statement1 :  &quot;His MajestyTs Government must explain the matter. As far as we are concerned 1 can say that we had nothing to do with it. We simply acknowledged receipt to the Holy See through the intermediary of England, as we had no repre-sentative at the Vatican. In August 1917 the Pope made an attempt to bring the opposing sides together. He made proposals Avhich might be used as a basis for making overtures to Germany. England and Ave decided not to follow up the Pope&apos;s proposals, but England out of deference sent an acknowledgment in most polite terms. The British Minister at the Vatican, quite on his own initiative, remarked that in the proposals no sufficient guarantees for Belgium existed. Cardinal Gasparri used these declarations to telegraph to Germany in order to have further details as to the guarantees to be given to Belgium. It Avas the beginning of a conArersation which it was thus desired to bring about, but the British Government cut it short at once. The British Minister did not proceed any further Avith the matter. He remarked that the first thing to do would be to obtain explicit guarantees for Belgium. Germany did not wish at that, time to give them. There Avas no com-munication from either of the Entente Governments. Monsieur Erzberger has distorted the facts. If the letter of the Nuncio is examined, it will be seen that the British Minister spoke of guarantees to be given to Belgium, and the Nuncio asks for a reply in order that the conversation at Rome may continue. The British Government saw the danger at once and instructed their Minister not to say any more. Evidently Avhat happened was far from being an offer made by the British and French Governments. His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, did not inform me that it had sent an acknoAvledgment to Rome. 1, therefore, telegraphed to the Foreign Office to request that I should be associated in the step, but it was merely an acknowledgment in the deferential terms Avhich the situation demanded. That is all I know. I simply said to the British Government &apos; Do not let yourselves be involved in an indirect conversation of this kind.&apos; &quot;Sir G. Grahame added (July 28th) that the publication of Monsignor PacellPs letter of August 30th, 1917, had excited considerable astonishment in France. [For M. ribot&apos;s subsequent statement, given to the Temps, see Appendix.]GERMANY.Slesvig. Information from Denmark, coming under this heading, is given under &quot; Denmark.&quot;British Representation at Berlin. The Netherlands Government has been asked to alloAv their Minister at Berlin to continue to represent British interests in Germany until the first Proces Verbal of the deposit of ratifications has been drawn up in accordance Avith the final Article of the Peace Treaty (F.O., July 24th).Reported Negotiations with Bolsheviks.- According to information received via Stockholm (Mr. Ramsay, July 25th), based upon a Press telegram from Berlin (July 22nd), unofficial negotiations are being carried on between Germans and Bolsheviks, and big industrialists in Germany are working energetically for the resumption of trade relations with Russia, &quot; with the approAral or at least the knowledge &quot; of the German Government.Position of Herr Erzberger. Herr ErzbergeFs recent speech to the National Assembly has been fully reported in the Press. On July 24th Lord Acton reported on very good authority that Erzberger was all-powerful in Berlin.   In a further M. Kibot lias since given to tlie Tempi an Authorised account of his views ; the Echo&apos;s version was not submitted to him before publication, and needs some reservations(Sir G. Cirahame, July 28th). For a translation of the statement in the Temps, see Appendix.
telegram dated July-7th Lord Acton reported that prominence;was being&quot; given in Switzerland lo the allegation that under Michael i&apos;s Chancellorship Germany neglected an offer of peace from England forwarded to the Holy See through the British Envoy and thence through Munich to Berlin. (see also under France.) German Wireless of July i&apos;7th quoted German Press reports in support of Erzberger, &quot;including the following from the Voncaerts : &quot; TJic crime perpetrated by the Pan-Germans against the German people has been slid further revealed. That this war had to end in the complete defeat, and destruction of the.German people afler they had given of their best for four years is entirely the work of the Pan-Germans. In. commenting on Press notices of the revelations about the Peace interventions in August .1017, German Wireless announces that comments wd! nol be silenced without-a further elucidation of the truth.Constitution Bill.- German Wireless of duly 23rd reported the conclusion of the second reading of the Constitution Bill in the National Assembly, also the adoption of the proposal.by the Independents making the families of the former riding princes for ever ineligible for the Presidency of the German Republic.Mercantile Marine. The following is an extract from a summary of Berlin Wireless of July 23rd :  &quot; As a result of the transference of the German Mercantile Fleet to the Allies the German shipping industry, once the most important factor of Germany&apos;s share in world traffic, finds itself in difficult and serious circumstances. One of the first personages in German shipping circles lias expressed himself on the situation to the following effect: &quot; Under present conditions the construction of the German Mercantile Fleet must be a slow matter on account of the defective import of raw materials and increase! in workmen&apos;s wages. Owing lo the cost of wages, material and coal, a newly constructed licet, even if the restrictions on cargo space were abolished, could not carry freight at a profit. Nevertheless, Germany must try to build up a small mercantile Hoc;! again, if only to iiud occupation for the host of unemployed. Meanwhile, Germany must try to lure merchant ships from neutral. States. So long as she has no fleet of: her own Germany&apos;s prospects of appearing once more in the worhPs markets are small.&quot;Strikes. German Wireless of -1 nly 25th-27th reports the probability of a sharp conflict in the metal industry, leading to a general strike throughout the whole industry.   There is also said to be a similar movement afoot amongst, telegraphists.Bavaria. Lord Acton explained on July 2-i-th the situation about Bavarian diplomatic representation, and thought that representatives of Foreign Powers would still be received at Munich. He did not know to what extent the decision might be attributed to Berlin, but the Landtag at Munich is reported to have decided upon the withdrawal of Bavarian diplomatic representatives in foreign countries.The separate Bavarian War Office, according to a statement by Lhe Prime Minister in the Landtag, is to be closed by the 1st of October (ibid).Opposition by the Clerical Party in Bavaria to the suppression of diplomatic representatives in foreign countries is reported (ibid, July 25th).HONDURAS.internal Situation. The internal situation is at present considered very serious, and it is expected that a revolution will shortly take place. Political refugees are seeking safety in the British Consulate and in United Slates Ministry at Tegucigalpa. It is considered probable that Marines from the United States will be asked for. The information, comes from the Acting British Consul at Tegucigalpa (Mr. Armstrong, Guatemala, July 24th-25th).HUNGARY.Report from Bucharest. According to a report from Bucharest a Rumanian Press account states, quoting&quot; the authority of the Daily News, that a representative of a British Socialist newspaper is about to visit . Budapest in order to establishS42d-5o li
communication with tho Bolsheviks ol&apos; llungarv (Mr. Raftigan, Bucharest, July 25th).Attack upon Slovakia. It is rumoured that the Hungarian Government have purchased guns from the Italians, and that an attack upon Slovakia is probable (Mr. Gosling, July 24th).The following answer by Bela Kuhn to the Prime Minister of Slovakia is published in Wireless Press News of July 28th : &quot; The Hungarian Soviet Republic regrets that a Hungarian aviator dropped bombs on July 24th on Csap, which town, since the conclusion of the Armistice, is on territory of the Ozecho-Slovak Republic. It must be stated on behalf of the aviator that this part of Czecho-Slovakia was used by the Rumanians as a jumping-off place against us. To all three questions contained in your telegram I can answer in the affirmative, and I hereby declare : (1) That the Hungarian Soviet Republic holds itself aloof from any enemy action against the Czecho-Slovak Republic, including the eastern Hungarian and Ruthenian districts awarded to Czecho-Slovakia by the Peace Conference ; (2) that wo will make good devastations, so far as they are not tho usual results of warfare, in territories occupied by the Hungarian Red troops in consequence of the Czecho-Slovak offensive ; (3) the Hungarian Soviet Republic neither carries on nor supports any political propaganda among nationals of the Czecho-Slovak Republic; With the object of clearing up these questions, we ask that the negotiations begun with the Minister Srobar maybe resumed.&quot; And now honoured comrade, I the Socialist speak to you, a brother Socialist. Now that we have declared om-selves ready to grant all three wishes contained in your telegram, allow me as the representative of the proletariat to speak to you as follows : We most willingly submit to your wishes in order to demonstrate before the proletariat of the whole world our readiness for peace and to prove that the campaign directed against us is an ignoble one. The Hungarian Soviet Republic was compelled to resort to arms in order to defend its vital interests and to protect the frontiers fixed by the Paris Peace Conference. The Hungarian Soviet Republic does not interfere in the internal affairs of any State, and in spite of its solidarity with the oppressed in all countries, yea, just for that very reason, the Soviet Republic requires no one to free himself from capitalism, but endeavours simply to prevent its own workers from again falling under exploitation. Nothing is further from our minds than to rob any nation of its liberty or to prevent it from developing its individuality in the interests of the whole of humanity. This alone is a guarantee that we cherish no inimical intentions towards the Czecho-Slovak Republic. Should you wish for other guarantees, enquire of your Minister Dr. Laurenz Srobar, and the Pastor Andreas Blink a of Rozsahegy, who suffered with us under the old Hungarian capitalist regime, whether they consider it possible that I can have a place in the Government of a State which stood in the remotest degree for the suppression of national ideas.&quot;   (The remainder of the message is mutilated.)Attack upon Rumania. The attack by the Hungarians upon the Rumanians on July 22nd, which was carried for about to kilometres east of Szolnok was reported by Air. Rattigan, Bucharest, on July 23rd (received July 25th). The Rumanian Military Report issued by Wireless on July 29th stated that the Hungarians were being pursued over the Theiss by Rumanian troops which had captured the Szolnok bridgehead.- The Rumanian military authorities are reported to be confident about the military situation (Mr. Rattigan, July 24th).ITALY.Halo-Serbian Proieds. Sir 0. des Graz on July 25th reported that tho Italian Government had protested against the action of Serbian troops in crossing the Eastern Albanian frontier, on the plea that this action is not in accordance with the military arrangements arrived at in the autumn of 1918. Sir C. des Graz reported further that the Italians had sent troops into the Scutari district, which was internationalised under the same agreement. The Italian Government has asked His Majesty&apos;s Government to support its protest to the Serbian Government.The Internationale. An article in The Times of July 29th throws some light upon the influence of &quot; the Pan-German Internationale &quot; in Italy.
JAPAN.Atrocities in Korea. On July ISth and 22nd the Japanese Ambassador in London admitted atrocities during the recent disturbances in Korea, and added that the Japanese Government was punishing the offenders and taking measures to prevent recurrence.MEXICO.Imports of Arms from United States. Mr. Lindsay (Washington) on July 27th reported that the export of ammunition and arms to Mexico from the United States without &quot;licence had been prohibited by proclamation of the President on the previous day.Bandit Activity. On July 24th Mr. Cummins (Mexico) reported the continued activity of bandits, including attacks upon trains, over the whole of Mexico.Relationship with United States. No excitement was to be observed among the public or in Government circles or in the Press about relationship with the United States. The people of Mexico were tired of the continued disorders in the country, and were in a state of apathy (ibid).NETHERLANDS.The Ex-Kaiser. According to the General Stall&quot; review of the Foreign Press for July 25th, opposition in Holland to a possible demand for the surrender of the ex-Kaiser was apparently stiffening.NORWAY.League of Nations. Mr. Ovey (Christiania) on July 25th reported on good authority that the Norwegian Government Avas anxious to adhere to the League of Nations, and was only prevented from doing so at once by the wording of the terms of the invitation, as affecting previous ratification by three Great PoAvers of the Peace Treaty. Even if the Norwegian Government should not be a member of the League of Nations at the time of the Washington Conference, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be approached with a view to securing Norwegian representation.SERBIA.Sir C. des Graz, on July 18th (received 24th), reported that Serbians inhabiting the region in the Temesvar to be evacuated in favour of the Rumanians were manifesting alarm, and it was hoped that someone representing the Allies would be sent to the spot to reassure the Serbians and guarantee the safety of their property.SWITZERLAND.Prinee Mux of Baden. Lord Acton denied a current report that Prince Max of Baden had arrived in Switzerland, but had little doubt that the Federal authorities are considering the cpiestion of his admission.Grand Duke of Baden. The Grand Duke of Baden, accompanied by his family, arrived in Switzerland, near Romanshorh (Lord Acton, July 28th).THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Mr. Taft and Ratifieation.-Mv. Lindsay on July 27th reported that Mr. Taffs letters,, which had been published in the Press, had been issued to the public without authority. He considered that the President might either agree to ratification of Peace Treaty Avith certain reservations which in his opinion would not impair acceptance by the United States, or else he would be obliged to tour the country, and. to exercise his influence upon the public, in order to press the Senate to fall in with his vieAArs.8-120-4!.c
sShantung Question. The Japanese Government has been asked to issue a statement at once to the effect that Japan intends to evacuate the Shantung Province in the near future, in accordance with the understanding arrived at in Paris. Failing-such action, the President will give publicity to the facts (Air. Lindsay, July 2Sth).Mexico. Agitators in favour of intervention by the United States in Mexico have been showing renewed activity (Mr. Lindsay, July 29th).   [See also under &quot; Mexico.&quot;]VATICAN.Relations loilh France.

AP PENDIXTOWestern and G-eneral Report No. 130.Translation of Statement communicated to the Temps by M. Ribot. (Sir G. Grahame, July 28th).&quot;It is true that the French and British Governments were in agreement not to answer the Note of the Holy See before Germany herself had made knoAvn what reparations and guarantees she was disposed to grant. The British Minister to the Holy See was told to take the opportimity of explaining to Cardinal Gasparri that no serious step could be made so long as the Central Powers had not made known their plans, notably as regards Belgium. When the French Government learnt of the instructions sent to the British Minister, they expressed the desire that he should be likewise charged with verbally associating Prance in the reply of the British Government. The British Minister took it upon himself to leave a Note with Cardinal Gasparri in the course of his conversation which could not have been other than purely unofficial. Cardinal Gasparri availed himself of this to send to the Nuncio at Munich the telegram which has just been published. In conformity with the views expressed by the French Government, the British Government felt that it would be dangerous to allow ourselves to engage in a discussion which was at least premature, and they sent instructions accordingly to their representative to the Holy See. This is all there is to be said of the incident. What must be noted is that Germany, pressed by the Holy See to explain clearly her intentions with regard to Belgium, refused to do so. It is only too clear that in August and September 1917 Germany had not in any way decided to give back to France Alsace and Lorraine, nor even to restore entire independence to Belgium.&quot;W.C.P. 1127, a Memorandum (being an annex to Austrian Note No. 661) as to the treatment of private rights under the Draft Treaty of Peace, received from the Austrian Delegation on July 9th.Bulgaria.
