WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.. Bolshevism. Extracts from a report issued by the Home Secretary are given in an Appendix to this Report.This subject is also referred to under &quot;China (Repatriation of Coolies),&quot; &quot;Germany,&quot; &quot;Baltic Provinces (Military Situation),&quot; and &quot;Switzerland.&quot;The Blockade. A memorandum has been circulated by the Foreign Office showing the advantages of maintaining the present blockade system, the abolition of which is being strongly advocated by the trading community in Great Britain and other couutries. The reasons for its maintenance are summarised as follows :--(1.) The blockade is the most effective weapon left to the Associated Powers for speedily obtaining their peace terms. (2) If the blockade is discontinued, even for a short period, it will be impossible again to bring its machinery into operation. (3) The continuance of the blockade is calculated to secure an early peace. (4) Its abolition would mean fierce trade competition among the Associated Powers. It is further pointed out that a schedule of largely increased rations for the Northern Neutrals has been approved by the Allied Blockade Committee (vide Report No. 100, page 2). The advantage of directly controlled relief for Germany over casual supply via the neutrals is also shown.On February 14th Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that, while he was in favour of maintaining the general structure of the blockade system, some modification might be made in the case of Austria-Hungary owing to the danger of a spread of Bolshevism.Trade with Bulgaria and Turkey. It was decided on February 12th to allow Turkey and Bulgaria to resume commercial relations with the Allies. -Latin America. Proposals strongly urged by the United States Government for the abolition of the censorship and Black Lists in Latin America are still being discussed by the Superior Blockade Cotmcil (vide Report No. 100, page 2).Censorship of Mails. It has been decided that, in order to maintain the censorship, ships carrying mails between the United States and the Northern Neutrals must laud them for examination at a specified British port.Export of Foodstuffs to Germany. A resolution dealing with the export of foodstuffs to Gerrnanyand re-export from neutrals came before the Superior Blockade Council on February 15th. The following recommendations for control were made : -(.1.) Direct shipment to he controlled by Inter-allied agencies to be established by the Supreme Relief Council in enemy or contiguous neutral countries. (2) Re-exports from border Neutrals to be controlled by the Inter-allied Trade Committees in Northern Neutrals. Inter-allied agencies to be set up in enemy countries through whom all purchases from Neutrals must be made. (3) Foodstuffs to be consigned to those agencies. (4) German private credits in neutral countries to be used as far as possible in purchasing foodstuffs.An agreement has been signed at Troves arranging the method by which Germany shall pay for supplies.German Foreign Securities. His Majesty&apos;s representatives in neutral countries have been informed that the French Government anticipates that during the period of the Armistice enemy subjects will endeavour to realise their securities abroad. They have therefore been instructed to co-operate with their French colleagues in keeping a watch upon any attempts made by enemy subjects to dispose of their property.
Supreme Economic Council.  A Supreme Economic Coimcil consisting of live delegates from each of the Powers has been formed for the purpose of co-ordinating all questions dealing with Blockade, Food, Finance and Shipping. It is anticipated that this Council will absorb the Supreme Council of Supply aud Relief and the Superior Council of Blockade.Fall in Freights. Attention is drawn to a statement, reported in the Times of February 19th, made by Sir Alfred Booth to The Philadelphia Press explaining the causes of the reduction of freight rates which has lately formed the subject of comment in the United States.ALLIED GROUP.CHINA.Repatriation of Coolies from Russia. The United  States  Government  has received the following reply from its representative at Peking: &quot; Minister considers that the repatriation of Chinese coolies from Russia is not practicable because the Chinese Government has no means of taking action there, and because the presence of these coolies in China in large numbers would endanger the peace of that country at this time.&quot;The British and Russian Ministers at Peking concur in these views (Mr. Barclay, February 11th).According to a Russian Wireless telegram of February 13th, the Russian and Chinese Workmen&apos;s Union have requested the Associated Governments to facilitate the return of Chinese workmen who are stranded in Russia without employment, to China, via Siberia.British Trade. At the instigation of the Chamber of Commerce, His MajestyV representative at Shanghai draws attention to the serious consequences Avhich may result, to f3ritish trade, with its high reputation for honourable business methods, owing to the attitude of certain British manufacturers who are repudiating contracts on the ground of the alleged rise in wages.FRANCE.German-Austria. Lord Derby reports that French public opinion is much perturbed at the idea of the possible union of Germany and German-Austria. The Temps complains that the need of German-Austria for the protection of the Allies against Bolshevism, famine, and bankruptcy should have been turned by them to better use than to throw her into the arms of Prussia. The Matin declares that the movement towards union is the result of propaganda and does not reflect the wishes of the majority.   The elections should be held as invalid by the Allies.GUATEMALA.Enemy Interests. Sir A. Youuge reports that measures are being taken for the liquidation of enemy interests.JAPAN.Aid to Chinese Northern Army Sir C. Greene has been instructed to inform the Japanese Government that the British Government views with apprehension the provision of money and arms by Japan to General Tuan Chi Jui&apos;s army (vide Report No. 106, page 3), which may be used to coerce the South, and to request it to cancel the contracts for this purpose.Sir C. Greene has been informed by the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Japanese Government does, not intend to lend its support to the Northern Army at a moment when a reconciliation between the North and South is imminent, and has. ordered the suspension of shipments of arms to China.PORTUGAL.Royalist Revolt. At the request of the Junta Government at Oporto, His Majesty&apos;s representative at Vigo forwarded on February 14-th to the British Government an appeal for intervention and a proposal for an armistice between the -contending factions.
The same day a message was received from Lisbon stating that the Republic had been restored at Oporto (Sir L. Carnegie, February 14th).Export, of Pitwood. Sir L. Carnegie has been instructed to make representations to the Government for the abolition of the export duty on pitwood winch, at the j)resent rate of 50s. per ton, renders the purchase of pitwood for the South Wales collieries impossible. The British Government intends to make the supply of coal to Portugal dependent upon the conclusion of an advantageous settlement of this matter.SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Montenegro. Lord Derby learns that on the night of February 3rd-4th shots were exchanged between Italian sentinels and Serbian patrols at Antivari. The Italian Government, therefore, presses for the execution of the proposal for the evacuation of Montenegro by all Allied troops. The United States Government also favours complete evacuation.On February 14th Lord Derby was informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government joined Avith the French Government in urging the United States to undertake the exclusive occupation of Montenegro. Otherwise a Franco-British occupation is suggested. Allied occupation in one form or another is considered the only method of counteracting Serbian aggression and of giving an opportunity for the free expression of the will of the Montenegrin people.Recognition. Mr. Barclay has received a memorandum stating that the United States Government has informed the Serbian Government that it welcomes the union of the Croats and Slovenes with the Kingdom of Serbia and recognises the Serbian Legation at Washington as representing the Jugoslav State. Territorial adjustments must depend upon the final decision of the Peace Conference.British Trade:-- Sir 0. desGrazhas been informed that it is intended to despatch to Serbia a mission composed of commercial and other experts for collecting and imparting information with regard to trade between Great Britain and Serbia. The mission will deal with questions affecting commerce and trade, agriculture, forestry and timber, sanitation and town planning, roads and railways, inland waterways, &amp;c.UNITED STATES.Naval Bill. Mr. Barclay reported on February 14th that the naval appropriation Bill for a three years&apos; programme had been passed in the House by 281 votes to 50, after the failure of an attempt to block the Bill by a technical question of imocedure. The building programme for ten battle cruisers and ten scout cruisers was so amended that the construction is not to begin until June 1st, 1920.The League of Nations.&apos; Mr. Barclay states (February 17th) that the New York Press does not show, great enthusiasm for the draft League of Nations. The Democratic Press approves the principles of a League and regards the draft as a good beginning. The Tribune (Republican) admits that the League is an advance oh the Hague Tribunal, but considers that the President has been forced to recede on the question of the colonies. The Sun says that the League necessitates a far-reaching amendment of the United States Constitution. Mr. Taft is strongly in favour of the League. Some Senators have adopted the attitude that it is impossible to subscribe to the League without violating the Monroe doctrine.ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-H UNGA R Y.German Bohemians. In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s representative at Prague the majority of German Bohemians would favour inclusion in the Czecho-Slovak Republic. At present their demands, which are excessive, include local autonomy and the use of the German language in Parliament and in the Law Courts. Mean-while the Czech Government has granted German minorities proportionate repre-sentation and the use of the German language in their schools.
G ERMANY.Formation of the Cabinet. The following is the composition of the new Cabinet (German Wireless Report, February 13th) :  President of the State Ministry - Herr Scheidenianu.Deputy President and Finance Minister - ,,   Schiffer.Minister for Foreign Affairs ...

Herr Fehrenbach (Centre Party) lias been elected President of the Assembly vice Dr. David.   Herr Sehulz (Social Democrat) has been elected Vice-Presideiit.The Governments Policy. According to a German Wireless report, dated February 16th, Herr Scheidemann introduced the following programme of Goveru-ment.action at a sitting of the National Assembly. Foreign Policy : (I) the immediate conclusion of peace on the basis of President Wilson&apos;s principles ; (2) the restoration of the German colonies; (3) the immediate restitution of prisoners of war; (1) participation with equal rights in the League of Nations, including reciprocal dis-arinament and the abolition of secret diplomacy. Home Policy : (I) Democratic administration ; (2) improvements in education ; (3) the creation on a democratic basis of a People&apos;s Army for the jnoteetion of the Fatherland ; (1) economic recon-struction and the development of transport, together with an improvement in the situation of small traders ; (5) rationing of food supplies ; (6) public control of those branches of industry which have assumed the character of a private monopoly ; (7)a. settlement of wages and conditions of labour between employers and workmen ; (S) a tax upon war profits and a super-tax on large incomes ; (9) freedom of conscience.The Constitution. Attention is drawn to a memorandum on the German constitution issued by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office.The Provisional Constitution Bill (vide Report No. 105, page 5) was passed by the National Assembly on February 10th against a small minority composed of the Independent Socialists and a few members of the Catholic Centre Party.Spartacus Movements. (1) Hamburg. A state of siege has been proclaimed for the purpose of ensuring the complete surrender of all arms by Spartacist elements.(2) Nuremberg. Considerable disturbances have occurred which resulted in the temporary control of the town by Independent Socialists and Communists (German737S-3!) BCzeeho-Slovak Convention. Sir C. des Graz learns that a Convention is about to be signed with the Czecho-Slovalc Government, by which the latter is to administer the navigation of all traffic on the Danube between Press burg and Baja under the supervision of British authority.Transylvania and the Banat. Sir G. Barclay (Bucharest) has received reports to the effect that in those parts of Transylvania which are not occupied by Roumanian troops the Roumanian population is being subjected to Hungarian depredations which show a Bolshevik-tendency; Sir G. Barclay urges the complete occupation of Transylvania by Roumanian troops.The Allied Ministers at Bucharest reported on February 5th that delegates from the Geniiau population of Transylvania and the Banat have signified their desire for union with Roumania. They repudiate any allegiance to Germany, from which they have been separated for eight centuries.Belief of German-Austria. Sir William Beveridge&apos;s Report (G.T. 676S) on the Inter-Allied Commission on Relief of German-Austria has been circulated. The Report deals with the economic situation of Austria, its effect on the political situation, and measures for relief.
Wireless, February I9tb).   Order was subsequently re-established after an agreement had been reached between these parties and the Majority Socialists.(3) The Buln- District. The strike movement has spread, and includes Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Hamborn and. Boolnun. The Spartacists, the centre of whose activities appears to be Bochum, are now in possession of one-tenth of the Ruhr coal-fields. They demand, inter alia, the deposition of the Government, the socialisation 0 of mines and foundries, the withdrawal of Government troops, the dismissal of the General in command at Minister (vide infra), and the maintenance of the Council S3&apos;stein.Westphalia. Sir W. Townley has received information to the effect that the Westphalian and Rhine towns are in favour of the establishment of a Republic on the ground that they form the richest district in Germany, and will therefore be compelled to pay heavy contributions towards the war. It was further suggested that a Westphalian Republic would form a buffer state between Prussia and the Rhine. The true reason for these proposals probably lay in a fear of French annexations on the Rhine.Bolshevism. The Russian Bolshevik and propaganda leader, Karl Radek, is reported to have been arrested on February .12th. Since his return from Vienna, where he fled after the overthrow of the Spartacus movement, his secretaries have been active in Bremen, Brunswick, and Weimar (German Wireless, February 14th).The Bavarian Government has called upon all men capable of bearing arms in -Bavaria to join a voluntary home defence guard for the purpose of protecting the country against the danger of Bolshevism (German Wireless, February 15th).Soldiers&apos; Councils. The General commanding the 7th Army Corps at Minister has abolished the Corps Soldiers&apos; Council which was working in open opposition to the Government (German Wireless; February .1.3th).Change in German Ideals. A Memorandum (G.T. 6770) has been issued by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office dealing with the &quot;Inner Change in Germany.&quot; The problem resolves itself into the questions (1) Has a real change taken place in the political ideals of the German people, and (2) if so, does this political change imply a change of moral judgment ? The writer considers that politically a change towards democracy has undoubtedly taken place. The party which before was prevented by the superior power of the &quot;ruling class Jroni realising its programme has now got the power into its hands. Germany is about-to become a democratic country in the truest sense of the word, unless the process is disturbed prematurely by a reactionary counter-revolution or hy a Bolshevik movement. Fmphasis is laid on the recurrence to the ideals of 184.S.With regard to the second question, though there are necessarily many shades of opinion, there is not only a general change in the conception of the political constitution profitable for Germany, but a different mode of judgment in- inter-national relations. German writers of democratic or socialist tendencies admit, a share in the guilt for the war, though only a share. A fuller knowledge, prevented hitherto by a strict censorship, is necessary for opening the road to repentance and a further change of feeling. These arguments are illustrated by a -number of quotations.Depreciation of the Mark. A Memorandum (G.T. 6778) has been circulated by Sir L. Worthington Evans, dealing with the effect of the depreciation of the mark. It is stated that if the mark is more depreciated than the British pound or the French franc, Germany will be at an advantage with regard to exported manufactures, since she will obtain more marks in exchange for pounds or francs and will thus be able to produce more cheaply. Countries which have no tariff would therefore be in danger of being flooded with German goods. A suggestion is made for neutralising the advantage of cheap labour due to a low mark and for obtaining an indemnity by imposing an export tax on manufactured goods in the currency of the country to which the goods are sold on the basis of the difference of value between the respective currencies.Poland. According to German Wireless reports fighting has taken place against the Poles. On February 12th Brandenburg and Silesian regiments captured Unruhstadt (on the frontier of Brandenburg) and Bomst, which is just within the Province of Posen.
NEUTRAL GROUP.- BALTIC PROVINCES.Military Situation. (1) General. Lord kilmarnock has been informed by the Esthonian representative at Copenhagen that the Esthonian and Lettish Governments are in full agreement with regard to operating against the Bolsheviks from the direction of Valk. It was stated that the morale of the bed Lettish regiments had declined. According to the Lettish delegate the Lettish Government does not contemplate conducting operations from Libau, owing to the presence there of German troops. The Baltic Barons are reported to be intriguing with the Germans and Bolsheviks and to have opened a recruiting station in Stockholm in their own interests (Lord Kilmarnock, February 15th).(2) Livonia. Fighting continues in the neighbourhood of Izborsk (west of Pskov), Marienburg, and Stakeln (south-west of Valk). At Stakeln the Bolsheviks are reported to be waging a stubborn battle (Russian Wireless, February 18th).(3) Courland. Lord Kilmarnock learns that a German army corps is expected at Libau, part of which has already arrived.   The situation has improved.(4) Esthonia.-Red Esthonian detachments are reported to have begun an offensive between the River Luga and Narva, and to have captured two villages north of Narva (Russian Wireless. February 18th).Food Supplies.-Lord Kilmarnock has been in formed that there is only a sufficient stock of corn at Reval to last for a fortnight:.German Garrison at Windau.-The following protest, has been addressed to the Russian Soviet Government (German Wireless, February 15th) : The German Government has received an official report that the German garrison of Windau, consisting of about 80.men, who were taken prisoners when the Soviet troops seized the town on January 31st, were shot, and also a number of German sailors several days later. The German Government express their strongest protest against such barbaric action and requests from the Russian Government an explanation of the facts.&quot;DENMARK.Food Belief. The Supreme Food Council at Paris has given its approval to the . constitution of a committee to undertake the relief of North Schleswig. It is pointed out that if measures for relief are confined to North Schleswig only, i.e., from the Danish frontier to Flenaborg Fjord, the impression may be given that this area represents the limit of the territory to be ceded to Denmark by the Peace Conference (Lord Kilmarnock, February 14th).General Mannerheim. Lord Kihnarnock reports that General Mannerheim arrived at Copenhagen on February 18th. He learns that the King was subjected to hostile demonstrations on his way to the station.FINLAND.Attach on Petrograd. The Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs has had a conversation with Mr. Clive with regard to General Manne.rheim&apos;s proposal for an attack on Petrograd with 50,000 troops to be raised in Finland. The Russian Party in Finland had held out the recognition of Finnish independence by Russia as an inducement to Finland to undertake this operation, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs insisted upon not only the approval of the French and British Governments, but their material support.The Germans have been forced to evacuate two villages in the neighbourhood of Schneidemuehl (North Posen).The Polish District Command of Hohensalza is reported to have issued a notice calling up all males of the younger classes, including Germans (German Wireless, February 13th).A lino has been drawn under the terms of the Armistice conditions beyond which the Germans are not to pass (vide &quot;Peace Discussions &quot;).
sMEXICO.Improvement in British Relations. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Mexico lias been engaged in unofficial conversation with a number of Carranza&apos;s adherents with a view to reaching some settlement with regard to the restitution of British properties and an improvement in British relations with the Mexican Government. Mr. Cummins has been informed that it is a fundamental principle of the Governments policy to prevent the acquisition by foreigners of large tracts of country which are often obtained at a very small cost, and that consequently an agreement must be reached by which British companies would receive new titles for their lands together with an adeqxrate area for extension the remainder of their properties being handed over to the Government under reasonable compensation. Mr. Cummins, on his part, has endeavoured to dispel certain misconceptions with regard to British policy. As a result of these conversations he has been requested by Carranza to visit him on February 18th.American Loan. A conference is reported in the Mexican Press to have taken place in New York for the purpose of raising a loan for the consolidation of the Mexican debt and the development of Mexican resources. His Majesty&apos;s representative points out the undesirability of such a loan while Carranza still retains British properties. Moreover, any difficulties met with in obtaining a loan would be attributed to British influence and would cause Carranza to realise the necessity for gaining British goodwill.NETHERLANDS.Passage of Troops. Sir W. Townley has received the reply of the Netherlands Government to the request made by His Majesty&apos;s Government that the demobilisation and replacement of British troops stationed in the occupied territory of Germany may he effected through Holland. The Netherlands GoArernment agrees to the demobili-sation of British troops via Dutch waterways with their arms, provided that, in the case of the Scheldt, arms are placed in the hold of ocean-going vessels, and, in the case of the Phine, are carried in separate barges which may accompany convoys. (The British military authorities subsequently arrived at an agreement by which arms may be carried in the same boats as the men.) A Dutch officer will accompany each convoy from the frontier. The Netherlands Government is also ready to agree to the railway lines Veido Eindhoven Bostel-Rotterdam being used under the same conditions as the Avaterways. The Government cannot consent to the passage of British troops proceeding to Germany.Lord Derby reported on February 14th that since a question of neutrality Avas raised with regard to the passage of troops through Dutch territory, the French Government Avas of opinion that the subject should be treated by the Allied Governments as a whole.NORWAY.Formation of the Government. Negotiations for the formation of a Coalition Government having failed with the refusal of the Conservatives and Liberals to accept the Socialist conditions, Avhich are belieA^ed to have included complete disarmament, the King has asked the Prime Minister, Mr. Knudsen, to reform the Government.British Trade. Sir M. Findlay makes suggestions for holding a British exhibition at Christiania in the interests of British trade Avhich is seriously threatened hy American competition. An American exhibition is to be opened in the near future.SPAIN.Enemy Shipping-Sir A. Hardinge has been informed that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment is prepared to agree to the temporary transfer of the six ships to the Spanish GoA^ernment subject to certain conditions safeguarding British interests and the ultimate disposal of the vessels as decided upon by the Peace Conference.SWEDEN.General Mannerhcinis Visit. General Mannerheim arrived at Stockholm on February 12th.   He was met by the King and accorded all the honours due to the
head of a State. The Extreme Socialists conducted demonstrations but they were scattered by the police.Mr. Branting&apos;s paper, the Social DemoUraten, has from the first expressed regret that General Mannerheim should visit Stockholm officially on the ground that if not actually responsible, he was at least compromised by the so-called White Terror which succeeded the Finnish revolution. Moreover, it is claimed that the Finnish Socialist Party had no part in the GeueraFs election to his present office.Mr. Clive reported on February 14th that in spite of lengthy discussion between General Mannerheim and the Government, no solution with regard to the Aaland Islands had been arrived at. General Mannerheim informed Mr. Clive that the whole Finnish nation was strongly opposed to the cession of the islands to Sweden.SWITZERLAND.Franco-Swiss Agreement. The terms of the new Franco-Swiss Agreement include the renewal of the loan to France in exchange for the supply of 60,000 tons of coal from the Saar basin, 15,000 tons from Cologne, and 60,000 tons of lignite from Belgium. The serious disadvantage at which these measures will place British coal has been pointed out to the French Government, and Lord Derby has been authorised to inform the Government that the export of British coal to France will be diminished to correspond to the amount of French exports to Switzerland from France or occupied territory.Bolshevism. Sir Tl. Rumbold has been instructed to represent to the Swiss Government the danger of allowing Helphand (Parvus), the notorious Bolshevik and German agent, to remain at liberty in Switzerland.Sir II. Rumbold learns through a reliable source that Helphand was originally granted German naturalisation on the recommendation of Count Brockdorlf-Rantzau and that the purpose of his visit to Switzerland is to create trouble in France and Italy.Trade. The Swiss Government has been informed that, His Majesty&apos;s Government has no objection to trade being carried on between Switzerland on the one hand and Serbia and Roumania on the other. Goods, however, must be accompanied by certificates of origin and interest. Permission to trade with Bulgaria, Turkey, Austria-Hungary, and Poland cannot yet be granted.Export to Central Powers. The United States&apos; delegate on the Inter-Allied Commission at Berne is opposing the principle that goods on the free list for Switzerland should be allowed free export from Switzerland to the central countries. Mr. Barclay has been instructed to inform the United States Government of the bad impression which such action would create in Switzerland.Ge man-Austria. Sir II. Rumbold reports that the Swiss Government considers the union of German-Austria with Germany prejudicial to Swiss interests, since Switzerland would in the event of such union be surrounded by an enlarged Germany.URUGUAY.Enemy Securities. HisMajesty&apos;s representative at Montevideo suggests that the Powers represented at the Peace Conference should take joint action for the conserva-tion of German property, in pursuance of which the Government of Uruguay might be requested (1) to make an inventory of all enemy property; (2) to appoint an administrator for banks and other enemy companies; (3) to pass a law suspending the effects of a sale of property belonging to enemy subjects.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.(N.B. Countries are arranged in alphabetical order under this heading.)League of Nations. The Covenant for a League of Nations has been printed and circulated (P. 106).   [Discussions by the Commission leading up to this result are. contained in W.C.P. papers 80, S3, and 94.]
Associated Powers. Reports of Discussions, I.C. 112,119-20, referred to on page 9&quot; of Western Report No. 104, &amp;c., have now been printed.

On the 18th Marshal Foch reported to the Supreme War Council on the meeting at Treves with Erzberger.]Re%)resentation of Religions (sec page 11, Report No. 106). In Anew of the fact that the Vatican has no representative at the Conference, it seems unlikely that the request of the ail-Russian Ecclesiastical Council for representation will be granted (F.O. 171, February 15th).Commission on Reparation. On February 3rd (W.C.P. 88) the Commission met under the Presidency of M. Klotz and decided to sit three times in each week to consider (a) amount of reparation to be paid by enemy Powers, (6) their capacity for payment, and (c) the method, form, and period in which this payment has to be made, and the guarantees necessaiy to ensure its completion. The folloAving countries are represented on the Commission : Great Britain, United States of America, France, Italy, Japan, Belgium, Greece, Poland, Serbia, Rumania, and Czecho-Slovakia. Sub-committees were appointed for (1) Valuation of damages ; (2)&quot; Means of payment and reparation ; (8) Measures of control and guarantees.Commission on Ports, Waterways, and Railways. On February 10th (W.C.P. .109) this Commission met under the Presidency of M. Crespi.   The following countries

The Committee on Rumanian questious (Chairman, M. Tardieu) on February Sth, 11th, and 13th (W.C.P. 106-S).International Socialist Conference. Sir 11. Rumbold on February 13th furnished a valuable report on the recent Conference at Berne. The general impression conveyed by the report is that this attempt to settle international questions by sections of the community, not working through their national Govern-ments, has been a great failure. The German Majority Socialists did not inspire trust. Not only were there strong divisions between races but also between those who represented trade interests and &quot; intellectuals &quot; in the same countries. Failure to arrive at a decision about Bolshevism, even more than failure to co-operate with Germans, augurs badly for the future of the Internationale.British Empire. Papers B.E.D. 3, 4 and G, referred to on page 10 of Western and General Report No. 104, &amp;c, have now been printed.France. Lord Derby, on February 13th-14th, drew attention to an article in Humanite (Socialist) criticising the severity of what were believed to be new clauses of the Armistice to be granted to Germany. The Temps expressed fear regarding union of German-Austria with Germany. The French Press in general was well satisfied with the Armistice terms, as far as known on February 13th.Holland. According to Sir W. Townley (February loth), the Belgian claims at the Conference at flolland&apos;s expense had produced a bad impression likely to strain relationship with Belgium. On February 14th the Dutch Minister in London raised the question of representation to the Peace Conference of the Dutch case. The Foreign Minister in Holland had put forward a proposal on the subject (F.O. 162, February I4th).Mexico. Mr. Barclay stated on February 14th that Monsignor Kelley (Chicago) was going to Paris to make representations, if possible, on behalf of Mexican archbishops about the treatment of the churches in Mexico by the Government.
APPENDIXTOWestern and. General Report No. 107.bolshevism.Extracts iuom Report circulated by the Home Secretary, dated February 10th, 1919 [G.T. G816].France. There has been a serious decline in French civilian moral during the past fortnight, and it is believed in Paris that serious labour disturbances at an early-date must be expected. This is due, primarily, to the high cost of living and profiteering, against Avhich the Government have been very slow to act. The first to suffer has been the ill-paid civil servant, and this class is now honeycombed with disaffection. It has been noticed that the feelings of civilians towards the soldiers has lately undergone a change ; the soldier is no longer the public idol, he is treated with indifference, if not with animosity. Strikes are pending within the next two weeks ; they will only add to the public discontent. With all this the popularity of M. Clemenceau is waning, and at a recent meeting of railway workers a speaker went so far as to say that, if M. Caillaux had had his way, there would have been no war.Anti-American feeling is said to be growing in Paris and in Rouen. .... Parisians object to the policing of their streets by American Military Police.....Switzerland. Details of the Bolshevik plot in Switzerland ai-e now pretty well known. The notorious Grimm was to establish himself as dictator and a Soviet Government would have been established under him. The Bolsheviks are still organising and carrying on propaganda among the troops. They speak of a fresh attempt at revolution at the end of the winter, when propaganda will have made greater progress.Mr. Henderson is much disappointed at the failure of the conference at Berne, but he says that he cannot confess it publicly. He thinks that the permanent commission will include Mr. Ramsay Macdonald.There is a report from an Italian source that the General Strike will be declared between March 20th and March 25th. This will be the occasion for the attempt at a Social Revolution which the Swiss Government are anticipating. It appears that Madame Balabanoff, the Bolshevik organiser, has been in Zurich for two or three weeks, having secured from the police an extraordinary promise, permis de sejour, for three months. She is said to be under the protection of the Federal Councillor Muller, Chief of the Department of Justice of the Police.Italy. At the recent Socialist Conference at Milan the extremists carried all before them ; they passed a resolution in favour of a Socialist Republic, to be established by a proletarian revolution, but they agreed that the time was not yet ripe.Russia. [Not dealt with in Western Report.] *Denmark. The Government is getting rid of Suritz, the Bolshevik Minister, anc? eight members of the Legation staff, but this is only one-third of the Bolsheviks whom the police recommended for expulsion.Norway. The Government has induced three Bolshevik propagandists to proceed to Russia with Vorovski and Litvinoff, without resorting to expulsion.Rumania. [Not dealt with in Western Report.]Holland.  Russians in Holland suspected of Bolshevik propaganda are now being interned, with a view to ultimate repatriation. Bankers have been confidentially asked to report to the Minister of Justice suspicious monetary transactions. The frontiers are being carefully watched, so far as their wide extent permits.Bolsheviks and the Peace Conference. From an Italian source it is said that, should the Russian Bolsheviks not be received at the Peace Conference, they intend to attempt to bribe the guard at the Peace Palace and place a bomb there to explode
the building. Madame Balabanoft&apos; is said to have brought this order. She is also said to bo introducing Bolshevik propaganda Into-.Northern Italy.Bolshevik English and French. In consequence of Mr. Phillips Price having described himself in his pro-Bolshevik pamphlets as &quot; Correspondent of the Manchester Guardian,&quot; the editor has written to him, dismissing him from all connection with the paper.   The letter was mild in tone, but quite firm.Besides Price, the French report that an Englishman named Rowlands is starting a Bolshevik Academy, ostensibly for teaching English and French, on capital supplied by the Government. Captain Sadoul is to assist him aud is shortly expected to be in Berlin.B. If. T.Strictly Secret. Minister,&apos; &quot; 14th December 1918.To all Head Agents left of the Rhine.Arising out of the Conference held on the 2nd December 1918, we give you herewith once more the guiding principles for the work we have to do. As has been repeatedly pointed out, the first thing is to make it clear to the poimlation there that Bolshevism does not constitute the serious danger to Germany which it is largely considered to be.The German power of resistance is still firmly rooted. Its strength is cohroosed of the Bourgeoisie, the Intellectuals, the middle classes (Burgertum), and an over-whelming majority of the German workmen.It would be possible to destroy German Bolshevism with one stroke, but we need Bolshevism in order to subdue our deadly enemies, England and Prance, by spreading it amongst the ranks of their armies, so that after achieving this end the sleeping German lion may re-awaken.Our next objective, therefore, is to  make these   plans known to our fellow-countrymen.   The latter must then do their share by individual work among the soldiers of the armies of occupation.   No effort or cost must be spared in order to gain our secret object.   Here again German energy and organisation must win.   Long ive our great German Vatcrland.(Signed)       FvAXSTEJN, Captain.Z.d. Aden 1321 B.   (Secret.) Munster,16th January 1919.All head Agents are notified that reports on the preparatory work, giving as complete details as possible of activities and success obtained, are to be rendered to the A.K. 3 by 21st of this month, and I hope that all will be so far complete and that all posts will be able to give proofs of their powers.(Signed)      Captain Kanstein.Crefeld,Herr Hauptmann Kanstein, Munster. 20th&quot;January 1919In reply to yours of 16th instant under z.d. Acten 1321 B.E., I beg to inform you as follows : Up to&apos;to-day tire result of our work has been that great dissatisfaction, and in some instances mutiny, have arisen amongst the Belgian troops of occupation here, and, in consequence, desertion is the order of the day.I have taken some of these people into my pay and to-day received a report from one of them that on Saturday next a meeting for the propagation of Bolshevism is to be held in Brussels. I shall&apos; be present at this meeting. Our work is now much easier, as the civilian population are aiding us in every possible way. . During my absence Fraulein Neumeier will represent me, and any orders should be sent to her. At my return I will visit you personally. -Further, I request that you send me 10,000 marks by your courier Welter. I must have this sum at my disposal by 12 noon on Thursday at the latest. Up to the present we have not noticed any counter activities on the part of the enemy police.Yours truly,W. Ehrhardt.
