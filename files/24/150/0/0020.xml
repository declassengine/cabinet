WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Bolshevism. This subject is referred to under &quot; Southern Slav States (Political Situation),&quot;: **. Austria-Hungary,&quot; &quot;Germany,&quot; &quot; Baltic Provinces,&quot; and tbe &quot;Nether-lands (Political Unrest).&quot;Relaxation of Trade Restrictions,-^Commercial relations have been resumed with German-Austria as from April 2nd, under the same conditions as are applicable to Turkey (Foreign Office, April 2nd).Food Supplies. At the request of the Food Section of the Supreme Economic Council, the Superior Blockade Council has authorised the export from Norway to Poland, Esthonia, Austria and Germany of 7,500 tons of fats of Norwegian origin (Foreign Office, April 5th).German Foreign Securities. The following instructions have been issued to His Majesty&apos;s representatives in neutral countries (Foreign Office, April 2nd) : . &quot; The situation has been somewhat changed by the action of the German Govern-in en t in agreeing to sequestrate certain categories of foreign securities held by German subjects abroad in payment for the importation of foodstuffs into Germany, and pending further instructions you should take no further action as regards the disposal of securities or balances held abroad by German subjects.&quot;ALLIED GROUP.CHINA.Repatriation of Enemy Subjects. Sir J. Jordan reports that up to April 4th a total of 2,234 enemy subjects had been repatriated.A deadlock has arisen with regard to the repatriation oi enemy missionaries due to the attitude of the United States Minister (Sir J. Jordan, April 5th).   -Repayment of Russian Loan. The Foreign Office learns that the Mongolian Government is anxious to repay a Russian loan of 4,000,000 roubles and that the Japanese are prepared to advance money for this purpose in return for mining and industrial rights in Mongolia.fn the opinion of Sir J. Jordan the unsettled condition of the country does not justify British participation in such a measure.Ghino-Japanese. Relations. A. Memorandum (G.T. 7081) has been issued by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office dealing with the main events in. the relations of China with Japan. The Memorandum takes the form of an historical survey. Special attention is drawn to Japan&apos;s &quot;Twenty-one Demands&quot; embodied in the Chi no-Japanese Treaty of 191.5 and including concessions in Shantung, an extension of the Ivuantuiig lease in South Manchuria, mining and other rights in East Mongolia, concessions in the Yang-tsze Valley, Japan&apos;s consent for concessions to foreign Powers in Fukien, measures for administrative control. An account is given of Japan&apos;s hostile attitude towards the Chinese revolution, of her support of the South against Yuan Shih-K&apos;ai&apos;s Government, and her subsequent policy, as exemplified by the &quot;Arms Alliance &quot; of 1917, of guiding and controlling the North.FRANCE,Press Articles. Sir G. Grahame in a despatch, dated March 30th, states that the prospect of an early announcement of the preliminary peace proposals has called forth a number of articles in the French Press enunciating the French point of view.
Stress is particularly laid on (l)-the immense losses caused to France by the war and the question of reparation and indemnities (M. Capus in the Figaro); (2) the spirit of revenge which will Undoubtedly actuate Germany in the future, especially on account of the loss of her colonies and fleet, and which makes practical measures for security essential to French existence (Matin).M. Herve, in Victoire, disagrees with President Wilson&apos;s view that it would be a violation of right to detach the Whine Provinces from Germany and form them into a neutral State, They would form a new &quot; German Belgium.-&quot; lie also deprecates the idea of leaving the Sarre valley politically attached to Germany or of converting Dantzig into a free town.&quot; Pertinax &quot; in the Echo de Paris criticises the methods of the Peace Conference. He claims that the advice of experts is not sufficiently heeded.Humanite expresses satisfaction with General Smuts&apos; mission. The Journal prefers General Mangin, the soldier, to General Smuts, the statesman.Socialist Programme. According to a despatch from Sir t?r. Grahame, dated March 30th; the Commission charged by the last National Congress of the Socialist Party with drawing up the electoral programme of the party has ended its labours.Pending the advent, it is hoped by peaceable methods, of the social revolution, the programme recommends that a constituent assembly should meet in order to revise the constitution, the basis of which should be as follows: Universal suffrage for both sexes, direct consultation of the people, right of popular initiative, full proportional representation by large districts, a single legislative assembly, admini-strative decentralisation, exclusion of certain professions from a legislative mandate, creation of economic chambers, adaptation of the functions of Government to social and economic measures, and the reorganisation of all public administrations and great monopolies on an industrial pattern.The programme contemplates for the achievement of economic restoration a strict revision of all war contracts and profits, a strict levy of a progressive tax on income, the establishment of fiscal monopolies, participation of the State in large undertakings, the reacquisition by the nation, for the benefit of the collectivity, of railways, transports, mines, large factories, &amp;c.In respect of immediate reforms, the programme adopts the most essential claims now put, forward by the Labour classes, as&apos; well as a thorough improvement in the lot of agricultural labourers ; it recommends the adoption, without delay, of measures for hygienic reform and social protection and all possible steps for the development of the material welfare and moral education of the working classes.The accomplishment of these reforms must depend upon a just and lasting peace.General Labour Confederation. In the course of the final session of the National Confederal Committee of the General Labour Confederation resolutions were passed in favour of the immediate enforcement of an eight-hour day, representation of all &quot;nations without exception at the first meeting of the International Labour Conference whose decisions should have the force of law in all countries, and larger representation of labour at the Peace Conference.The.ratification by the Senate of a Bill dealing with collective labour agreements was condemned (Sir G. Grahame, March 20th),The Assassination of Jaures. The following telegram has been received from Sir G. Grahame (March 31st): &quot; At a meeting of the Socialist Federation of the Seine yesterday the &quot;following Order of the day was voted: &apos; The assassin of Jaures is acquitted. This class verdict, inspired by hatred and fear of the proletariat constitutes for the Labour and Socialist classes of France a challenge and a lesson. Let history record this act of civil war. The Federation of the Seine instructs its Executive Committee and requests the Permanent Administrative Commission to come to an agreement with the representatives of the Trade Unions to give to this act the immediate consequence which is required.&apos;&quot;French Claims.1 In an interview with Lord Curzon on April 2nd, M, Cambon expressed his misgivings with regard to the British attitude on the questions of the two banks of the Rhine, the creation of a buffer State, and the annexation of the Sarre coalfields, which were essential to French existence, Lord Curzon drew the French Ambassadors attention to the friction between the French and British authorities at Oonstantiuople and the need for the definite allocation of spheres of action.
ITALY.The Elections. In a conversation with Sir R. Rocld, Signor Martini, former Minister for the Colonies, stated that at present the elections were timed to take place in June, but that there was a strong feeling in the Chamber in favour of first dealing-with electoral reform and proportional representation, both of which, in view of the present dishonest system of parliamentary life, he considered very desirable. He was of opinion that Baron Sonniuo would not be returned hy his old electorate on account of (1) the unpopularity of the war with the Tuscan peasant ; (2) Socalist influences ; (3) the opposition of the new Catholic &quot; Italiau Popular Party,&quot; which would be controlled by the Priests.   The Vatican considered Baron Sonnino as an enemy.Italian Currency. The following telegram (April 7th) has been received from Trieste : -&quot; From the 10th instant Italian money becomes the legal currency of Trentino and Venezia Giulia and from the 20th instaut Austro-Hungarian money ceases to have legal currency.&quot;Goal Supply. Sir .R. Rodd reports that in April Italy&apos;s coal supply from Great Britain fell short of the amount expected by nearly 100,000 tons, while the prospects for April are even worse. The Minister of Transports has appealed for assistance. Italy has been compelled to reduce her gas supply, transport is lacking, and many industries have closed down. Sir R, Rodd supports Signor Ciufelli&apos;s request in view of the serious consequences which may arise especially in Milan and other industrial centres.PORTUGAL.Treatment of British Indian Subjects. Lord Curzon has made strong representa-tions to the Portuguese Charge cPAffaires in London protesting against the Portuguese Governments procrastination in dealing with those responsible for the ill-treatment of British Indian subjects in the Portuguese territories of East Africa (Lord Curzon to Sir L. Carnegie, April 2nd).SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Political Situation. A French authority on Jugo-Slav questions has informed Sir C. Grahame that the Belgrade Government is finding increasing difficulty in maintaining its authority over the former Slav provinces of Austria, Bolshevism constitutes a real clanger. He emphasised the importance of Fiume being given to Jugo-Slavia.Arrest of M. Raditch. Sir C. des Graz reports that M. Raditch has been arrested on the charge of pro-Italian activities at Fiume and Laibach.ThcGovernment. Vacant posts in the Ministry have now been filled. Dr. Koroshetz takes over the Ministry of Reconstruction, General Had j itch becomes Minister of War, and M. Paul Marinkovitch (Serbian representative at Bucharest), Minister of Mines and Forests. A Ministry of Agrarian Reforms has been created and given to a Serbian Croat. A Slovene becomes Minister of Social Policy, and a Moslem from Bosnia, Minister of Agriculture (Sir C. des Graz, April 5th).Hungarian Relations. Sir C. des Graz reports that the Hungarian emissaries have not been received by the President of the Council. The latter acknowledged the friendly sentiments expressed by the Hungarian Government and stated that the Jugo-Slav Government wotdd act in consort with the Allies.UNITED STATES.Filipinos Delegation. The following telegram (April 5th) has been received from Lord Reading : &quot; A delegation of 40 prominent Filipinos, headed by Manuel question, the President of the Filipinos Senate, yesterday presented a memorial to Secretary Finger (who received the delegation in the absence of the President), asking for complete independence for the Philippine Islands.&quot;After reading a letter from, the President, Secretary Baker stated that the feeling of the President and himself, and he believed also that of the country, was that the
time had &quot;substantially come, if not quite come, when the Philippine Islands could be allowed to become an independent people.&quot;Z) The League of Nations. The impression is gaining ground that the RepublicanParty will accept an amended covenant. Considerable satisfaction was aroused by Press reports to the&apos; effect that the President had favourably received Mr. Taft&apos;s amendments regarding reservation of the Monroe Doctrine, matters of domestic jurisdiction, unanimity of decision of the Executive Council, and the right of with-drawing from the League. The New York Evening Post thinks that if these amend-ments are accepted a clear issue will shortly arise &quot; between those who like the League plan as amended through the efforts of the Republican leaders and those who want no League at all,&quot; i.c., Senators Borah, Reed, and Poindexer (Lord Reading, March 3rd). Finally,-the same paper considers that Mr. Root&apos;s letter published on March 30th marks the &quot;strategical withdrawal&quot; of the Republican Party (Lord Reading, April 7th).Thi Peace Conference. The question of reparation and the fate of the Saar Valley are reported in the Press to be still the great obstacles to the conclusion of the preliminary peace. Whilst the Press generally sympathises with France, the Times and the World warn her against any attempt to settle these questions except upon the basis of the Presidents 11 Points.There has been a general outburst of disapproval in the Press of any attempt to recognise the Bolsheviks (Lord Reading, April 7th).Committee of Commerce.- Lord Reading learns that a Committee of Commerce has been formed by the Bankers&apos; Association for the purpose of assisting the expansion of American foreign trade.ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Hungary. The following points were made in President GarbaPs speech on the economic policy of the Soviet Republic : Though communism is to be adopted, all small capital, small businesses and small family houses are to remain untouched.Great Banks, Joint Stock Companies, factories and large landed estates are to become common property.No one who exploits these is to have a vote, but anyone ceasing to exploit and working honestly with his brain or body, may claim admission into the body of workers.The method of working the land is to be much improved.All languages are to be on an equal footing, and the authorities will reply in the language in which they are addressed (Budapest, April 7th).The Ivorr Bureau (April 2nd) gives further information with regard to tbe formation of the Councils and of the National Assembly (vide Report No. 1.13, page 5). The Councils will send from the county councils and town councils one representative to the National Assembly for every 50,000 inhabitants. The affairs of the villages and the towns will be conducted by the local Councils of Workmen, Soldiers and Peasants. The working people of the village will send one representative to the village council for every 100 inhabitants and one representative to the town council for every 500 inhabitants. The town council, however, cannot consist of more than 300 members.The Revolutionary Government have decreed that the elections are to be completed, by April 14th.Sir G. Marling learns from a former Austro-Hungarian Minister at Copenhagen that the majority of the population of Hungary is opposed to Bolshevism which only met with success owing to the despair of the Nationalists. In the event of Allied military intervention the movement would collapse. Large sums of money are reported as being employed for Bolshevik purposes in Vienna and Bavaria.The representative of the Czech Republic, who left Budapest on March 27th, states that in addition to the old army, which consisted of some 70,000 soldiers, a7780-26 n
new army is being raised composed of Magyar and International Red Guards. He asserts that Allied intervention would be welcomed (Mr. Gosling, April 1st).A British journalist has informed Lord Acton that Count Karolyi&apos;s conversion to Bolshevism has taken place with the full understanding of. the German-Austrian Government and also of&apos; the German Government in Weimar. lie also learns that, immediately the peace terms are received by German-Austria and Germany, the Governments of those two countries will decline to accept them, will resign and declare their adhesion to Bolshevism (Lord Acton, March 29th).Sir C. des Graz reports that the Foreign Missions from Budapest have arrived at Belgrade.M. Noulens, the Head of the Polish Commission, has received information, which, however, he treats with all reserve, to the effect that the Ruthenians and the Hungarian Revolutionary Committee have made an agreement for the free passage through Hungary of the Russian Bolshevik troops stationed near the Galician frontier.&apos; German-Austria. Professor Lammasch has received information that a Communist Republic is to be established by the Congress of Workmenrs and Soldiers&apos;Councils, which is to meet at Vienna on April 14th. The German-Austrian Yolkswehr consists of about 57,000 men, of whom some 35,000 may be considered as Red Guards. He appeals for Allied intervention to prevent a Bolshevik outbreak (Sir H. Rumbold, April oth).Count Palffy has spoken to Lord Acton to the same effect. According to Herr Eldrisch, the leader of the Moderate Socialists, the Communists intended to make a coup (Vetat (Sir 11. Rumbold, April 2nd).The heads of the Neutral Missions at Vienna have addressed a note to the Swiss Government requesting it to bring to the attention of the Entente Governments the great gravity of the present political situation (Sir H. Rumbold, April 4th).Union, with Germany. Baron Haupt, the representative of the German-Austrian Government at Berne, has drawn up a Memorandum in which he states that German-Austria only accepts the idea of union with Germany for lack of a more tolerable alternative. He formulates four conditions which are essential if such union is to be prevented and German-Austria is to enter a Danubian Confederation as an alternative; (1) the initiative must come from the Czechs; (2) guarantees must be given that tire rights of Germans in Bohemia will be respected ; (3) there must be no hegemony of anyone member of the Confederation; (4-) German-Austria must have at least one railway which does not pass through Jugo-Slav territory.German Silesia. Bis Majesty&apos;s representative at Prague has been instructed that proposals for the independence of German Silesia are not to be encouraged (vide Report No. 1.13, page 0).GERMANY.Political Situation. (l) General. Lord Acton learns that in Professor Forster&apos;s opinion Germany will follow IIungary&apos;s example, should the Allies attempt to dictate too severe terms of peace. M. Payot, a correspondent of the Journal de Geneve, who has recently returned from Berlin, states that, while Herr Ebert is unlikely to take such a step, Count Brockdorff-Rantzau is undoubtedly prepared to precipitate Germany into Bolshevism in the event of intolerable peace terms being imposed (Lord Actou, March 29th).According to a German Wireless report attempts have lately been made in several towns to gain support for a military revolt in April which is to overthrow the Government and the National Assembly and to set up a Soviet Republic. Meetings have been held in Magdeburg and Berlin at which Independent:Social Democrats have assisted the soldiers (Nation, April oth).(2) Bavaria. The Augsburg Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council held a mass meeting on April 3rd, at which it was decided to declare their solidarity with the Hungarian and Russian Soviet Republics, and to turn Bavaria into a similar Republic. On April 4th! a general strike started as an expression of sympathy with the Russian and Hungarian Bolsheviks and the Stuttgart strike, and also as a protest against the recruiting for the volunteer corps. The Bavarian, Central Council has postponed the meeting of the Bavarian Assembly which was due to take place on April 8th. The Munich garrison refused to afford any protection&apos; to the Assembly, if it met (German Wireless, i\pril Sth and 6th)&apos;. &apos;
Oii April Oth the Bavarian Central Council issued a proclamation stating that Bavaria was a Soviet Republic and that the whole Government would be taken over 3&amp;    by the Workmen&apos;s, Soldiers&apos;, and  Peasants&apos; Councils.   The Landtag is declared dissolved.   Herr HofluianrPs Government is reported to have established itself at Bamberg (Nauen, April 4th and 8th).(3) Ruhr District. 142,000 men were reported to be on strike on April 4th (Nauen, April 6th).   A general strike has been declared at Diisseklorf (April 8th).(4) Stuttgart. A. general strike commenced on March 31st followed by a bourgeois counter-strike. A state of siege was proclaimed, and after street fighting order seems to have been restored (Nauen, April 2nd and 5th).(5) l&apos;&apos;ranlifort-on-Main. Serious disturbances, ascribed to food shortage, occurred on March 31st. The Police Headquarters were stormed bv the mob (Nauen, April 2nd).(6) Bremen. The Bremen National Assembly opened on April 4th. lierr Dunkel (Deutscher Demokrat) was elected President. The two Vice-Presidents will be elected from the Majority and Independent Social Democratic Parties (Nauen, April (5th).The Council System. The following announcement appears in the German Wireless Report of April 6th : &quot;The Cabinet has approved the following amendment to Article 34 of the Constitution. Workers are called upon to co-operate with employers on equal terms in matters concerning the regulation of wages and work and the general economic * development of productive forces. Organisations on both sides are recognised. Workmen will have authorised representatives in trade councils and a national Workmen&apos;s Council, arranged according to trades and representing their social and economic interests. District Workmen&apos;s Councils and the National Workmen&apos;s Council meet to settle general economic questions, and to assist in carrying out the socialising law in co-operation with representatives of the employers.&quot; The draft of social-political and economic-political laws of fundamental import-ance will be submitted to the approval of the National Economic Council before being brought up in the Assembly.&quot;The National Economic Council has the right of itself proposing such laws to the Assembly, and these will be treated in the same way as proposals of the Go\rern-ment, or of the &apos; Imperial &apos; Council (Reichsrat). WorkmeiPs and Economic Councils may be granted rights of control in matters which come within their scope. The composition and the duties of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils, and their relations to other social self-governing bodies, are regulated By law.&quot;[Article 34 states : &quot;Labour is under the special protection of the Empire.&quot;]Volunteer Army.-According to General Dupont, the Chief of the Finnish Military Mission at Berlin, the number of volunteers is at present (March 22nd) 103,000, exclusive of two nominal Army Corps operating in Lithuania,Poland. The question of the landing of General HallePs army at Danzig was conspicuous in German Wireless Reports, and the usual complaints have been made with regard to Polish aggression in the Province of Posen.A communication from General Foch at Spa, dated April 4th, states that an agreement has been reached which, though formally maintaining the right of the Allies to utilise Danzig for the landing of Polish troops, stipulates that General HalleFs army may proceed to Poland by three alternative routes.Heligoland. The Admiralty has issued a Memorandum (G.T. 7001) on the future of Heligoland. After detailing the advantages which its possession affords to Germany, the Memorandum considers the following alternatives for its future disposal :  (a) retained by Germany, all defences being destroyed; (6) retained by Germany, the harbour as well as the defence works being destroyed ; (c) levelled to high-water mark (a comparatively simple engineering operation) ; (d) taken over by League of&apos; Nations ; (ie) returnee! to Great Britain. The third alternative is preferred, otherwise the second. Its annexation hy Great Britain is not recommended unless the island is rendered impregnable and a strong garrison maintained.
NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.The Port Strike. In view of: the difficulties connected with the congestion of tonnage and the transport of wheat, the Ministry of Shipping and the Board of Trade are not prepared to go to greater lengths in diverting shipping from the port of Buenos Aires (vide Report No. 11-1, page S). It is felt that an extension of labour troubles to otlier ports might result from a boycott of Buenos Aires (Foreign Office, April 5th).BALTIC PROVINCES.Military Situation. (1) Esthonia. Red Esthonian units have been repulsed 20 versts south-west of Narva (Moscow, April 3rd). Both sides claim the capture of villages in the neighbourhood of Pskov, where fierce fighting is reported to be taking place (Moscow, April 3rd and 6th ; Reval, April 3rd). Latest reports (Moscow, April 7th) state that the Bolsheviks have been forced to retire to positions west of Izborsk.(2) Livonia. In the Marienburg sector the Bolsheviks have occupied a series of villages 20 versts north-east of Marienburg, including Korvenhof Station (Moscow, April Oth).   The Esthonians acknowledge a reverse in this area (Reval, April 3rd).According to a German Wireless report (Nauen, April Oth) the troops of the Lettish Government have reached the Schlock-Kantzen-Olai railway line and are 17 versts from Riga.Food Supplies. 000 tons of wheat have already been shipped to Esthonia, and arrangements are well advanced for the despatch of further supplies both to Esthonia and Libau (Astoria, April 4th).American Mission. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Libau reports the arrival of the American Political and Economic Mission.FINLAND.The Government. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Helsingfors reports that the Finnish Diet was formally opened on April 4th. Negotiations are being conducted between the Agrarians and Progressives for the formation of the new Government, in which all parties except the Socialists are expected to participate.lied Civss Conference. A proposal has been put forward by a representative of the Russian Red Cross for a conference of Russian, British, American, French, Danish, Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian and International Red Cross Associations at Helsingfors, in order to consider what can be done for Russians in and out of Russia (Mr. Bell, April 1st).MEXICO.Opposition to Carranza. Owing to Felix Diaz having placed himself under the orders of Derringuez who has been nominated as Zapata&apos;s representative, a very considerable advance has been made in uniting Carranza&apos;s opponents (Mr. Cummins, April 1st).NETHERLANDS.Political Unrest. Considerable apprehension is felt by the Netherlands Govern-ment with regard to the situation on the German frontier. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have represented to Sir W. Townley the danger of a Bolshevik irruption. Four thousand Bolsheviks are reported to be assembled at Emmerich. A request is put forward for permission to export a quantity of foodstuffs to Germany. Though Sir W. Townley does not take the report of the intended Bolshevik irruption very seriously, he states that unrest is prevalent in Holland,
SWITZERLAND.Turkish Refugees. Sir H. Rumbold learns that Enver Pasha and Mahommecl Fonad are in hiding at Constance.The Turkish Minister at Berne is reported to be in close touch with Egyptian extremists.VATICAN.Holy Places in Palestine. With reference to an article recently published in the Petit Parisien, the Cardinal Secretary of State denied that he was in favour of inter-national control of holy places in Palestine, but stated that he preferred such control to the exercise of authority by Zionism. In the opinion of Count de Salis British administration would be received! by the Papal authorities as the best solution to the question (Count de Salis, April 5th).PEACE DISCUSSIONS.Handbooks prepared in the Historical Section of the Foreign Office.

Findlay that it has not received any notification from the German Government with regard to German ships in Norwegian ports. Norway claims prior rights to such ships in view of the losses sustained by Norwegian shipping.-Spitsbergen. According to information given by the Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs to Sir M. Findlay, instructions have been given to the Norwegian Minister in Paris to submit Norway&apos;s claim to administer Spitzbergen, as a mandatory or otherwise, to the Peace Conference.
