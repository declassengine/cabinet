Jugo-Slav forces have reached a line north of the debatable territory at Klagenfurth.United States (page 4). Criticism of the Peace Treaty, and especially of the League of Nations, in the Senate has been severe. It would be regrettable if, for purposes of domestic politics, members of the Republican Party should give support to doctrines such as those propagated by the notorious Hearst Press.Enemy Countries.Austria-Hungary (page 5). Hungarian troops have penetrated some distance into Czecho-Slovak territory. This success may help to give the Soviet Government the prestige which it needs. The Allied and Associated Governments have addressed a note to Hungary demanding the cessation of hostilities.Germany (page 6). Reports continue to be received from neutral countries to the effect that a Russo-German rapprochement is contemplated. It is unlikely, how-ever, that the present Government, which is chiefly concerned with the preservation of internal order, will play into the hands of the extremists.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Relaxation of Trade Restrictions. The following communication has been officially published through the Wolff Bureau (Berlin, June 1st) :  &quot; The Supreme Economic Council of the Entente has communicated to die &quot;German Finance Commission the following decisions, which are to be carried out in regard to the blockade : &quot; (1) The importation of foodstuffs is made entirely free for Germany within the monthly quota allowed her, and may be carried out without any formalities from any country which may wish to export to Germany. The importation of fish from the surrounding neutral countries is not to be included in the quota allowed.t: (2) Germany may export, without further formalities, and to any country that wishes to import such goods, all goods which are not on the prohibited list (gold and silver objects or war material) or the goods on the blockade list, viz., coal and coke of every kind, timber, wood for building, logs, printing paper, dyestuffs, iron and steel products (that is cast-iron, rolled iron bars, construction steel, steel plates, sheet steel), plate glass, engine tools and electric machines and their accessories.&quot; (3) All black lists of firms and persons in neutral countries have been with-drawn and all disadvantages attached to trading and intercourse with such firms have ceased to be effective.&quot; (i) Postal and telegraphic communication in regard to the import and export trade in goods indicated above is now permitted, but continues to be subject to certain conditions which have been accepted by the German Government.&quot; A further communication from the Supreme Economic Council of the Entente states that only goods on the prohibited list, not those on the blockade list, are to be excluded from exportation by land frontier. As regards the maritime export of goods on the blockade list, negotiations are still proceeding with the Allied and Associated Governments.&quot;ALLIED  GROUP.CHINA.North and South.-At a meeting of the Allied Ministers held at Peking on May 27th, a statement was drawn up for presentation to the Northern and Southern Governments. The statement expresses the hope that the Shanghai Conference will be resumed, and deprecates any recurrence of hostilities (Sir J. Jordan, June 2nd).On June 5th Sir J. Jordan presented the Memorandum to the President on behalf of the five Powers. The President replied that both parties are determined to prevent the renewal of hostilities, and that informal meetings are still being held between subordinate representatives of the North and South. He thought the reunification of China would eventually be achieved.Japanese Relations. The boycott of Japanese goods is increasing. The native banks at Shanghai and Tientsin are reported to have decided to suspend all business with the Japanese.   Shipping is also affected (Sir J. Jordan, June 6th).The Anglo-American Association of Peking has passed a resolution sympathising with the Chinese people and deploring the decision of the Peace Conference in ceding Shantung to Japan, as prejudicing the economic development of China and tending to perpetuate the conditions which led to the Boxer troubles in 1900 (Sir J. Jordan, June 6th).
SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Aggression in Carinthia. Following upon its Note to the Government at-Belgrade, requesting the immediate cessation of hostilities in Carinthia (vide ReportFRANCE.The Strikes. The following- industries have been affected : the transport services, the carriage building, aviation material, tailoring, and house-painting trades, the large metal and machine works in the Paris district, sugar refineries, laundries, and some mines in the northern districts (50,000 men). On June 4-th it was estimated that between 150,000 and 200,000 workers were on strike. On the 5th the situation showed signs of improvement. Agreement in the metal industries was reached on many points, though not on wages. On the 7th the strikes in the house-painting and tailoring trades were settled. The tone at meetings between masters and men was reported to be conciliatory. The Government is confident that it will be able to retain control of the situation. M. OlemeneeaiFs methods consist in patience and reluctance to use force, but determination to preserve freedom of work and inflexible resistance to violence on the part of strikers.With regard to the metal workers&apos; and mechanics&apos; strike, the masters complain that the men have not kept to tbe agreements made on April 17th and May 24th for (1) a week of 48 working hours ; (2) an increase in the wages of time workers to maintain the same total daily wages as before the eight hours&apos; day ; (3) an increase of pay for piece work only in cases where it was proved impossible to maintain the same quantity of production as before the eight hours&apos; day. The masters claim that they have respected these agreements and even agreed to meeting on June 5 th with the workers to discuss certain .further increases of pay, but that the workers also demand a 44 hours&apos; week (which the masters will not discuss) and have struck without waiting for the meeting.The Confederation Generale du Travail has published a proclamation to the nation in which it explains that the strikes are due to the resistance to the application of the eight hours&apos; day and springs from the increasing cost of living, which it attri-butes to the closing of the frontiers, the prohibition of imports, the exhaustion of stocks, fow production, the reduced means of transport, and profiteering. It asserts that the working class intends to preserve the proper character of the strike as a legitimate means of obtaining the redress of workers&apos; grievances against employers, and repudiates allegations as to its origin (i.e., German). It calls for calmness, declaring that it is not unmindful of social questions, amnesty, demobilisation and cessation of military intervention abroad (especially in Russia).M. Marcel Cachin in Uumanibe says that everywhere sufferings caused by war are bringing about the revolution prophesied by Maures ; that the present public state of mind resembles that of 1789 ; that the desire of well-being and liberty is more imperious than at any previous time, and that the proletariat, to secure these, now counts only on the transformation of the proprietary system.M. Paul Faure in Populaire openly proclaims that the amnesty and the cessation of war against the &quot; Workers&apos; Revolution&quot; are amongst the strikers&apos; aims, and that the voice of the people must be heard on questions of general policy.Latest reports (June 10th) state that the situation is unchanged. One June Gth a mass meeting of Paris railwaynien passed a resolution supporting the Russian, German, and Hungarian revolutionaries, advocating the expropriation of capital, and favouring immediate action to stop the movement of trains carrying troops. The Miners&apos; Congress at Bethune has rejected the agreement made in Paris by its representatives, and has voted for the continuation of the strike. The miners of the Loire district and the seamen at Havre have passed resolutions advocating the eight hours&apos; day.ITALY.Goal. The Minister of Transport complains that the allowance of 140,000 tons of coaf per month from Great Britain is insufficient to meet Italy&apos;s barest needs. Owing to the inferior quality of the coal obtainable and to the additional lines taken over in Trentino and Trieste the State railways consumed 252,000 tons in March and April and that amount has since been increased. 25,000 tons are used for bunkering merchant vessels in Government service and 50,000 tons by the Navy. Thus the .State alone consumes a total of 34-0,000 tons monthly (Sir R. Rodd, June 7th).
ISio. 122, page 5), the Supreme Council of the Allied and Associated Powers has addressed a further communication to the Serbian Government, calling attention to the fact that the Jugo Slav forces renewed their offensive on June 2nd and 3rd, bombarding the ground south of Klagenfurth and the surroundings of Grafenstein. The communique points out that on June 5th the Jugo-Slavs passed the Drava and that two officers entered Klagenfurth. An explanation of these aggressive movements is demanded (Astoria, June 9th).According to the latest information received the Jugo-Slavs now hold a line north of Klagenfurth, which they occupied without opposition, and have concluded an armistice with Austria on the basis of a neutral zone north of this line.Recognition. The French Government has officially recognised the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croatians, aud Slovenes (Sir C. des Graz, June Gth).UNITED STATES.The Peace Treaty. Mr. Barclay reports that on June Gth the Senate passed a resolution requesting the State Department to furnish them with a copy of the Peace Treaty. A further resolution was also passed for an investigation of how copies of the Treaty reached the hands of various persons in New York. The debate on this latter question was violent, and a good deal of resentment was expressed at the alleged fact that financial interests in New York have .been able to secure a text of the treaty which has been withheld from the Senate.In his weekly summary (June 9th) Mr. Barclay states that there is rather a desire on the part of the Republicans to damage the Presidents position than a hope of rejecting the League or the Treaty. The general public is impatient over the delays of the Peace Conference and there is a tendency in the Senate and in the Press to throw the odium on Great Britain of which the Irish agitation is symptomatic.This feeling is less strong in the Atlantic States than elsewhere.The Irish Question and the League.  Senator Lodge has informed Mr. Barclay that the resolution concerning Ireland recently adopted by the Senate was a political move and must be regarded as an attack upon President Wilson aud the League of Nations. It was intended to show that if-the Monroe Doctrine was open to inter-pretation by the League, then the United States were equally entitled to interfere in the affairs of other nations. Senator Lodge did not think it likely that the covenant would be accepted by the Senate without alteration or reservations.Mr. Hearst on England&apos;s &quot; Hegemony.&quot;--The following extracts, are taken from an article by Mr. Hearst in the Neio York American (May 10th) :  . &quot; The treaty of peace makes England mistress of the world.&quot; The United States has the spiritual satisfaction of having won the greatest war-in history after it had been lost by the Allies; but England has the material advantage of immense increases in territory, of the complete control of the seas, and of a very much enlarged relative position of power and importance among the nations of the world.   ...&quot; There remains as a rival of England merely the United States of America.&quot; And while England has acquired by this war enormous advantages of territorial, commercial, and political character, the United States stands where it did before the war, except for the sacrifices of blood and treasure that it has made, and the serious financial burdens which it has incurred.&apos;&apos;The important thing for the United States is not to expect gratitude for its work for others in this war or any reward for the benefit it conferred from any other nation, but to set out now to take care of itself and its own people as capably and conscientiously as it can, in order that the relative recession it has incurred through the advancement of other nations shall not be long enduring but rather that by close attention to our own country and our own interests, as has been the established policy of our nation in the past, we may again advance our country to the first place in world leadership which it occupied before this war began.&quot;It is entirely within the abilities and resourcefulness of our people to accomplish this task. But we cannot accomplish it if we are to be hampered in the task by a series of rules and regulations and by a sort of European supervisory restriction similar to that which has to be exercised by the victorious nations of Europe over their defeated former rivals.&quot;
ENEMY GROUP.A LIST I MA-HUNG A R Y.Hungary and the Allies. The following message signed by M. clemenceau has been sent to the Soviet Government at Budapest on behalf of the Allied and Associated Powers : &quot; The Allied aud Associated Governments are on the point oil summoning repre-sentatives of the Hungarian Government to appear before the Peace Conference at Paris, in order that they may be informed as to the views of the Conference concerning the just frontiers of Hungary.&quot; At this very moment the Hungarians are attacking the Czecho-Slovaks violently and unjustifiably and are invading Slovakia.&quot; The Allied and Associated Governments, however, have already given proof of their firm desire to bring all useless hostilities to an end by stopping on two occasions the Rumanian armies which had crossed the limits set by the Armistice and the limits of the neutral zone, and by hindering them from continuing their advance on Budapest by stopping the Serb and French armies on the Southern Hungarian front.&quot; In these circumstances the Budapest Government is formally invited to put an end without delay to these attacks on the Czecho-Slovaks. Failing this, the Allied and Associated Governments are absolutely resolved to have immediate resource to extreme measures, in order to force Hungary to cease hostilities and conform to the firm intention of the Allies to have their injunctions respected.&quot; The reply to this telegram must be made within 48 hours.&quot;The following reply was addressed to M. Clemenceau by Bela Kim : &quot; The Hungarian Soviet Government learns with satisfaction the intention of the Allied and Associated Governments to invite Hungary to the Peace Conference. The Hungarian Soviet Government cherishes hostile intentions towards no people, and desires to live in peace and friendship with the whole world, more especially as it does not take its stand upon a basis of territorial integrity. Hungary did not wish to attack and, indeed, has not attacked the Czecho-Slovak Republic, with which she has always desired and still desires to live in peace and friendship. She always respected the lines of demarcation laid down by the Allies, and conformed to the clauses of the Military Convention of November 13th. Nevertheless, she has been forced to note with regret that the troops of the Czecho-Slovak Republic, of the Jugo-Siav Kingdom and of Rumania have penetrated, under cover of the prestige of the Allies, and in opposition to the Military Convention of November 13th, into the territory of the Hungarian Soviet Republic and have already threatened us . (jammed).   When forced by extreme necessity, we took up arms.&quot; We note with satisfaction that the Allied States have ordered the Czecho-Slovak Republic, Jugo-Slavia, and Rumania to cease ther attacks against us, but we are obliged to state that the above-mentioned States have not obeyed the injunctions of the Allies, and that their offensive was only arrested by our counter-offensive, and, further, that their troops are still beyond the line of demarcation fixed by the Convention of November 13th. In order to avoid the useless shedding of blood, the Hungarian Soviet Government again declare themselves ready immediately to cease hostilities against all these States. In order that the Allies may be in a position to force the Czecho-Slovak Republic, Jugo-Slavia and Rumania to obey their orders to cease hostilities and to execute the clauses of the Military Convention of November 13th as well as for the settlement of questions connected with it and for the pro-visional solution of economic questions, it appears necessary to us that the States concerned should send delegates to Arienna and that a mixed Commission representing the States should proceed to a just and equitable settlement.&quot;Legislative Measures in Hungary. A draft decree has been drawn up, subject to the approval of the peasant proletariat, assigning to the Soviet Republic : (1) The estates of the former Exchequer ; (2) the former endowed estates of the Church and the estates administered thereby ; (3) all landed estates of more than 150 acres. The territory of Hungary which lies within the line of demarcation has been divided into 12 districts, each of which possesses a central station. Round this central station are grouped the industrial and financial administrations of the district.   In819-4-2ii li
separate districts are formed industrial production- councils, which send out an administrative commission composed of five members, who, in agreement with the Budapest People&apos;s Commissary for Social Production, direct the whole production of the district concerned. As soon as a district is liberated hy the Red Troops, steps are taken for the organisation of social production on these lines.The Government has decided to begin to withdraw from circulation the notes of the Austro-Hungarian Bank and is issuing a new currency to replace them.The Government has decreed universal military service for all men between the ages of 17 and 45. Thereby military service is extended to all proletarians, who are not members of a trades union, whereas, before, only the organised workers were compelled to defend the Republic. Anyone evading service or helping anyone else to do so, commits a crime, and will be brought before the revolutionary tribunal.Military Situation. According to the Korr Bureau the Hungarian Army has met with success along the whole of the Czech front. It now holds the line Eperjes  north of Torna Jolsva south of Tiszolcz Zolyom Leva (north of the Danube). Pressburg, which contains the only powder factory in Czecho-Slovakia, is threatened by this advance, which, has penetrated well into Czech territory. The morale of the Czecho-Slovak troops is reported to be low and there is serious shortage of ammuni-tion.   General Pelle has been appointed Counnander-in-Chief of the Czech army.Austria. Lord Acton states that according to official Austrian opinion at Berne, the Peace Terms will render the union of German-Austria with Germany inevitable. The Clerical Party in Austria is now said to favour union.Czecho-Slovakia. According to a Wireless Report from Nauen dated June 5th, the chief representative of German-Bohemia, Dr. Von. Langenhahn, has addressed an appeal to the people of German-Bohemia calling on them to resist the incorporation of German-Bohemia, which contains 2\ million Germans, in the Czecho-Slovak Republic. The appeal concludes with the words : &quot; We must not rest till we are once more free human beings on our free German soil.&quot;GERMANY.Political Situation. (1) General. Sir W. Townley (The Hague) learns, from what is stated to be a reliable source, that the Government has definitely decided to refuse to sign the peace terms unless unexpected modifications are made by the Allies. In the&apos;event of refusal co-operation between the Russian and German Governments is said to be contemplated. Sir W. Townley&apos;s informant further states that the national spirit in Germany has been revived, that there is a large, though ill-supplied, German army on the Polish frontier, that there is an undercurrent of Bolshevism in Poland, and that Germany has been much heartened by the Labour movements in France, Great Britain and America.(2) Munich. The Communist leader Toller has been arrested, and Levine and other leaders of the recent movement have been.condemned to death by court-martial. The attitude of the working population is said to be calm (Nauen, June 5th).(3) Berlin. A one day strike was proclaimed on June 7th by the Berlin Work-men&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council as a protest against Levine&apos;s execution (Nauen, June 7th).(4) Brunswick. The state of siege has been annulled.(5) Hanover. Two attacks were made on the military prison where Spartacists arrested in connection with the recent disturbances are confined. The intention was to release the prisoners.   The attacks were repulsed (Naueu, June 8th).Herr Ebert on the Peace Terms. Interviewed by a representative of the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, Ebert expressed his views on the peace prospects as follows : &quot; In the enemy Press the opinion is frequently voiced that in the event of the terms as proposed by the Entente being adhered to, the present Cabinet would resign and would be replaced by men prepared to sign the treaty, and in this way the difficulties would be quickly overcome. This view, however, does not take into consideration the fact that according to our present. Constitution the signing of peace must be effected by Act of Parliament, that is to say, by the joint, approval of the National Assembly and Federal States Committee. The National Assembly, by an overwhelming-majority, has taken up the same standpoint as the Government, and the Federal States Committee has unanimously adopted the same attitude.   I
cannot, therefore, conceive how a Cabinet holding a different view on this question of the peace terms could obtain the confidence of the National Assembly which the Constitution demands. Another Cabinet would only be possible if the gains won for democracy by tbe Revolution, and out of which the National Assembly arose, were to be thrust aside. But the great mass of the German people will oppose this Parliament of Terrorists of the Right and the Left. Our nation is committed to Democracy, and will cling to its privileges of self-determination.&quot;Separatism. (1) General. Lord Acton learns that the Papal Nuncio at Munich, wdio recently visited Berne, advises the French Government to appoint diplomatic representatives to Bavaria and the lesser German States in order to counteract the centralist tendency of the German Government.(2) Rhincland. According to a wireless report of June 5th, the Wiesbaden organ of the Centre Party jmblished a manifesto stating that the Government was in the hands of Dr. Dorteu and other &quot;ministers &quot; who refused to accept any further orders from the Prussian, Bavarian, or Hessian Governments. Their success seems to have been short-lived, as they were ejected from the Government building at Wiesbaden after a slight disturbance. The Prussian Government has issued orders for the arrest of Dr. Dorten.Accusations continue to be made in German wireless reports against General Mangin and the French of fostering the separatist movement in the Rhineland.The Centre Party of the National Assembly have formally denied all sympathy with the people who have been instigating the agitation for a Rhine Republic. They protest against, the action of the French in taking part in a question which only concerns Germany&apos;s internal politics (Nauen, June 4th).The general opinion of the Press appears to be that the result of a plebiscite would be in favour of establishing a free Rhine State within the German Empire.The working people of the Rhine districts expressed by a one-day strike their disapproval of any scheme for separating the Rhine Republic from Germany. The Cologne railway employees have appealed to President Hirsch to send them a President who is firm in his opposition to a Rhine Republic (Nauen, June 4th and 5th).(3) Hanover. The Prcussisehe Zeituncj (May 31st) accuses England of being behind the Separatist party in Hanover.Upper Silesia. A Central People&apos;s Council for Upper Silesia has been established in Oppeln with a view to uniting all parties in case of a struggle for Upper Silesia. A committee of five members has been formed which includes members of all parties from the German Nationalists to the Independents and the Central Party (Nauen, June 5th).New Economic Committee. The Government has appointed an Economic Committee, with full and independent powers, to deal with goods required by Germany, to arrange for payments and credits abroad and for the importation of food and raw materials. The Commissary for Exports and Imports still continues. The object of the new authority is to discover new means of restoring economic life.The Potash Industry. The following statement with regard to the potash industry appears in the weekly Economic Report issued by the Berlin Foreign Office:-&quot; A survey of the potash industry shows that it is suffering quite severely from the shortage of coal, hence a large part of the potash works are lying idle. Though it may be true that many works have yielded a surplus in recent years, now the reserves in most of them have been used \ip. In consequence of the discovery of considerable deposits of potash in Argentina and Galicia, and in consequence of the cession of Alsace-Lorraine, the potash monopoly possessed by German industry has finally been broken down, so that there are now fresh factors in existence standing in the way of a restoration of the potash industry.&quot;Decline of Agricultural Production.  According to the Vossische Zeitung (May 26th) Germany produced before the Avar, with the aid of imported fertilisers and fodder, 15,000,000 tons of grain and 3,250,000 tons of meat, whilst at the present, time she can produce only 9,000,000 tons of grain and 950,000 tons of meat. During the war the production of meat, fat, and milk has been reduced to of peace production ; the production of bread, grain, pulse, oil, fruits, potatoes, sugar beet, and home-grown fodder to 50-60 per cent,, of the necessary requirements ; pig stocks
shave declined by SO per cent., stocks of horned cattle by -10-50 per cent., and the value of stable manure is only 35 per cent, of what it was in peace times. IE Germany is to feed her population, the possibility of importing crude phosphates and albuminous fodder must be given her.   This means a vast expenditure.NEUTRAL GROUP.THE BALTIC PROVINCES.German Aggression. A large number of telegrams have been received from Libau and Iteval which all point to an increasing determination on the part of the Germans to obtain a firm foothold in the Baltic Provinces.Esthonian and Lettish troops are advancing southwards from Wenden, while the German and Bait Landwehr are advancing north and north-east from Riga. The clanger of a collision is imminent as the Esthonians are determined to resist German encroachments. German agents are reported to be endeavouring to raise a mutiny among Esthonian troops. [Mr. Grant Watson endorses this report, naming two German officers who have been sent to Reval.] Mr. Bosanquet urges the immediate withdrawal of German forces from Latvia (Mr. Bosanquet, dune 4th). Mr. Grant Watson is of opinion that it is Germany&apos;s policy to act in concert with the Bolsheviks as long as the latter are in power, but at the same time to ensure the hegemony of the Baits in the Provinces and through them to establish her influence in Russia (June 4th).The Germans have ordered the Esthonian advance to stop, and are preventing the establishment of a Lettish civil government in northern Latvia (Mr. Bosanquet, June 4 th).The Esthonian General Staff has presented an ultimatum to the commander of the Bait Landwehr troops requesting them to retire behind a Hue drawn from Segevold to Neuschwanenburg (Mr. Bosanquet, June 4th).Mr. Grant Watson (Libau) reports that Courland is completely under German military dictatorship, and that every form of Lettish local administration has been suppressed. The Baltic Landwehr is largely composed of Germans, who expect to obtain grants of land in return for their services. The Germans are audacious and act with great rapidity (June 5th).Mr. Bosanquet learns that a collision has occurred south of Wenden between the Esthonian and the German Landwehr (June Oth).Lettish troops have been forced to retire from Wenden, which is occupied by the Landwehr (Mr. Bosanquet, June 7th).The Esthonian Minister for Foreign Affairs presented Mr. Bosanquet with a Note, stating that it was the object of the Baits to destroy Esthouian independence, and of the Germans to render the frontier between Esthonia and Bolshevik Russia so vague as to be able to point to a continued Bolshevik danger. The Note requests the British Government to effect (I) the complete and immediate retirement of German troops from Latvia, (2) the expulsion of all Germans from the Landwehr, (3) the cessation of assistance by Germany to the Landwehr, (4) the cessation of hostilities by Needra against Estbonia (June 7th).200 Russian officers who were formerly prisoners of war in Germany reached Libau on June Gth and were allowed to continue their journey to Riga on condition that they joined either the Bait Landwehr or Prince Lieven&apos;s Corps (Mr. Grant Watson, June Sth).Mr. Bosanquet forwards the text of an ultimatum sent on June 5th by the German General commanding at Mitau to the Esthonian General Command. The ultimatum complains that the Esthonians attacked Lettish troops under German command, alludes to the advantage to the Bolsheviks of a conflict between Esthonia. and Lett-land, and demands the withdrawal of Esthonian troops behind the linguistic frontier of Hainash-Valk-Izborsk. In reply the Esthonian Commander-in-Ohief stated that Esthonian and Lettish troops under his command were fighting the Bolsheviks along the whole frontier, that Kreuzberg and Jakobstadt had been captured from them, and that he refused to allow Bait troops to destroy the Volmar-Alt-Schwanenburg railway which was essential to his conduct of operations. He accused the Bait forces of failing to co-operate against the common enemy (June 9th).
fiThe Situation at Riga. The capture of Riga has given Needra a temporary-popularity. The Lette, however, are still bitter with his Bait German administration owing to the wholesale execution without trial of Letts accused of Bolshevism and the retention of the booty captured at Riga by the Baits and Germans (Mr. Grant Watson, June 2nd).The Governor of Riga has been informed by the Allied representatives that he will be held personally responsible for the execution of Letts, who have not been allowed proper trial. Owing to the &quot; White Terror &quot; there is danger of Riga relapsing into anarchy (June 9th).The Bait Landwehr, supported by German forces, completely controls the administration at Riga,   The Esthonian consul has been arrested (June 9th).Hostile demonstrations were made on June 9th by officers and men in German uniform, who collected on the quay, against H.M.S. Waterhen. German time has been introduced in Riga (June 10th).A concentration of German troops towards Mitau is reported (June 11th).Russian Northern Corps. General Sir 11. Gough has visited the Headquarters of the Russian Northern Corps. It was decided that the Corps should be independent of the Esthonian authorities and should be responsible for the administration of the country east of the Esthonian frontier under the command of General Rodzianko. The Corps numbers 13,000 men under arms. The Russian Headquarters were opposed to General Udenich&apos;s presence for political reasons, and also to an advance on Petrograd by the Finns (Mr. Bosanquet, June 1th).Food Supplies. Mr. Hoover has made all the necessary arrangements for the despatch of foodstuffs to the Baltic ports for the purpose of revietualling the population in the recaptured areas. Further supplies are available in the event of the occupation of Petrograd (Astoria, June 5th).FINLAND.Operations against Petrograd. According to a telegram i-received from General Gough, General Mannerheim is anxious to advance on Petrograd in order to increase his own and Finlaud&apos;s prestige. Though he thinks that such an advance would prove decisive from a military point of view, General Gough points out that there are strong objections to it: (1) it would be opposed by many Russians, (2) the internal situation in Finland itself is not sufficiently secure.MEXICO.The League of Nations. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has issued an official statement declaring that the Mexican Government has no intention of demanding admission into the League of Nations (Mr. Cummins, June 4th).Revolutionary Activity.- The insurgent forces are believed to have captured Chihuahua (Mr. Cummins, June Oth). The Government forces have a considerable numerical superiority over their opponents, but their morale is uncertain, and General Angeles possesses greater military knowledge than any Government leader opposed to him (June 5th).NETHERLANDS.Reimposition of the Blockade. Sir W. Townley has received the reply of the Netherlands Government to the enquiry (vide Report No. 120, page 2) as to the attitude which would be adopted by neutrals in the event of it being necessary to resume the blockade against Germany. The Government declares that the proposals contained in the Note do not take into account the special political and economic position of Holland, and that, therefore, it is unable to offer the guarantees asked for.NORWAY.Coal. Sir M. Findlay reports that the coal position is extremely unsatisfactory from the point of view of importing merchants owing to the fact that the price of British coal has risen without any compensating increase in the maximum selling price.
The Norwegian Government Shipping Department is said to have bought 00,000 tons of American coal for shipment within the next two and a half months.There is, however, at present no indication that ordinary importers will buy large quantities of American coal so long as they can obtain supplies of British coal, but the recent pronouncement by Sir Auckland Geddes to the effect that coal production continues to fall and that this would probably necessitate a further limitation of quantities made available for export, has been widely commented on.SWEDEN.Recognition of Poland. It is officially announced that on June 3rd the Swedish Government decided to recognise Poland as a free and independent State (Mr. Clive, June 6th).THE VATICAN.German Representation. Lord Acton learns that Dr. von Bergen has been appointed as Prussian Minister to the Vatican. The Papal Agent at Berne states that there is a strong current of public opinion in Germany in favour of the creation of a German Embassy or Legation to the Holy See iustead of purely Pruss ian representation.SAV1TZE RLAND.Views of the Government on the International Situation. Lord Acton deals with the following points: (1) The difficulties arising out of the settlement of the question of military and economic neutral zones has somewhat strained the relations between the Federal Council and the French Government. (2) There is a tendency on the part of the German-Swiss members of the Government to complain of the manner in which the Vorarlberg question has been settled by the Peace Conference without consulting the Swiss Government. (3) The Federal Council is opposed to a prolongation of the Italian frontier line in the South Tyrol. (4) The Federal Council criticises the Peace Treaty as tending to create new nationalities and thus sowing the seed of future wars. This has resulted in hesitation to enter into the League of Nations. (5) Loixl Acton learns that, should Germany refuse to sign, the Swiss Government would probably consent to return to the economic conditions prevailing previous to the Armistice.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.Handbooks prepared in the Historical Section of the Foreign Office.
