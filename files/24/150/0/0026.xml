SECRET.APPRECIATION&quot;  OE THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND GENERALREPORT No. 120.General (page 2).There is again a general attitude of expectancy, awaiting the final issue of the Peace terms offered to Germany. Neutral Governments have been asked whether they are prepared to co-operate in certain matters, should the blockade of Germany be reimposed in its strictest form. In connection with the attitudes towards the Peace terms in different countries the most interesting are those of China on the Shantung question (see under China) and of Italy towards the Danubian question (see under Italy). Another important matter, seriously affecting German policy, is the question of the Baltic Provinces. The local situation there is dealt with on page 5, and attention is drawn to the important representations by Marshal foch  advocating the compulsory withdrawal of German troops under the provisions of the Armistice Terms. This paper is referred to under Peace Discussions (British Empire Delegation) on the last page.Allied Countries.Belgium (page 2). The Socialists adhere to their refusal to meet German Socialists on international conferences.China (page 2). China is reported as deeply aggrieved by the Shantung clause of the Peace Treaty, which has reduced the prospects of any agreement between North and South being come to through the medium of the Shanghai Conference. (See also reports from Japan.)France (page 2). Eastern questions, especially those of Syria and Smyrna, are filling the pages of the French Press.Portugal (page 3). There is dissatisfaction at the Peace terms, and German propagandists are making capital out of it against Great Britain.United Stales (page 3). Labour is reported to be hostile to Bolshevik elements.Enemy Countries.Austria-Hungary (page 1). Reports have been received through Spanish sources of negotiations for recognition of the Hungarian Government by the Czecho-Slovak Government.Thc Peace terms seem to have affected the attitude of German-Bohemians towards the question of joining Germany. Professor Masaryk has promised thorn equal rights and privileges, including language rights.Germany (page 4). Reports are given of reception of the Peace terms.Neutral Countries.Baltic Provinces (page 6). There are further indications of German policy to maintain influence.Switzerland (page 7). The Government is reported to be veering towards some form of union with the Vorarlbern1.G. G. A.May 22ud, 1919.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.The Blockade. On May 11th the Blockade Council passed a resolution to the effect that, in accordance with the decision of the Council of Pour, the Allied delegates should request their respective Governments to inquire whether Neutral Governments were prepared to prohibit all exportation, re-exportation, or transit of goods from or across their respective countries to or from Germany, except with the consent of the Allied Governments, should the reimposition of the blockade in its strictest form he considered necessary (Astoria, May loth).ALLIED  GROUP.BELGIUM.Attitude of Socialists. According to a report from the Home Office Intelligence Department (May 11th), the majority of Belgian Socialists are opposed to sending representatives to the International Conference, where they would meet German Socialists.   M. Vandervelde is said to advocate sending them.CHINA.Effect of. Shantung Clause in Peace Treaty. According to a report from Sir J. Jordan (May 11th), based on good authority, the position of the military leaders has been greatly strengthened by the terms of the Peace Conference ; they are now in a much stronger position, and the alliance between them and the military party in Japan has been strengthened. There is practically no hope of the Shanghai Conference coming to an agreement now, and reunion between North and South will only be possible under a Government purely military. China feels deeply aggrieved, and her position considered very difficult. The present intention was not to sign the Peace Treaty with Germany.The Admiralty reported (May 13th) that, owing to the Shantung ruling, the Chinese Government seemed to have weakened on the repatriation question, and Germans collected at Shanghai for the purpose were being permitted to return to the places in the interior from which they came.FRANCE.Press Articles on Syrian and Smyrna Questions. Lord Derby on May 16th-18th called attention to an article by &quot; Pertinax&quot; in the Echo, demanding that French troops should be substituted for British in Syria, and when that is done, and a clear understanding is come to with England, then &quot; France will talk things over with the Emir Feisal.&quot; The Allied occupation of Smyrna is regarded as indicating the end of the Turkish Empire. &quot;Pertinax&quot; in the Echo considers that the most important feature is that the United States is thereby deeply engaged in European (sic) affairs, provided that public opinion in America does not refuse to shoulder the respon-sibility. Further articles in the Temps, Humanite, Figaro, and the Journal on Turkish questions are also of interest. There is a definite reference to &quot; the Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916&quot; in the &quot;Temps.Inter-Allied Command in Baltic. The Admiralty (May 10th) reported that the French had agreed to the commander being a British Admiral.
ITALY.Danubian Federation and Jugo-Slavs. On May 19th Sir R. Rodd reported tha* there was much agitation, second only to that created by the Frame question, on the subjectrof Allied encouragement of a Danubiau Federation, in which the Jugo-Slavs would play a leading part.JAPAN.Demonstrations by Chinese Students. Tokio telegrams of May Sth (received 13th) reported strong demonstrations by Chinese students against the Shantung proposals and the tone of the Japanese Press, laying special emphasis upon hostile foreign (Russian &apos;?) influence working against Japan in Corea and in. China.PORTUGAL.Attitude towards Peace Terms. Sir L. Carnegie (May lGth) reported indignation and much disappointment that Portugal receives no indemnities from the Germans, and that although victorious she should &quot; be ruined.&quot; German propagandists are busy exploiting the &quot;lack of consideration&quot; of Portugal, and attributing it to ourselves.SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Serbia. Sir C. Des Graz (May 7th, received 16th) reported anxiety at Belgrade about the situation in Carinthia, attributed to Italian influences. On May 10th (received 12th) the Serbian Government asked for British aid in the provision of uniforms and food for their Army;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Reception of Peace &quot;Treaty and Triple Agreement. On May 12th Mr. Barclay gave a precis of Press comments between May 5th and 11th ; there seemed to be a general idea that the Senate would oppose the triple agreement between France,.Great Britain, and America as entangling America with European affairs. The Republican Press still showed hostility to the League of Nations. There was a growing-movement to try to detach the League of Nations from the Peace Treaty in order to ratify the one but amend the other. Concessions to Japan aroused much hostile comment. A very decided Press campaign supports the recognition of Ivoltchak&apos;s Government in Russia. Interest in the Fiume controversy had diminished. There is a growing demand in the Press for America to assume some sort of protection in the Near East, especially over Armenians and Arabs.&apos; Further comments between May 12th and ISth were reported on May 19th. There were indications that the Senate would severely criticise the terms of the Peace Treaty. The League of Nations was being much discussed, also the triple agreement. The Hearst Press was keeping the Japanese question alive. German objections to the Peace terms were not exciting any:sympathy.; There are various indications of attempts to accentuate differences with Great Britain, especially on shipping questions.Senate. The meeting of the Senate was fixed for May 19th (ibid).&quot; Bolshevism.&quot; American Labour was reported by Mr. Barclay on May 12th to be undoubtedly hostile to Radical and Bolshevik elements, and a growing demand was being made for restriction of immigration and expulsion of revolutionary elements. In this connection, attention is drawn to a special paper dated May 16th (G-.T. 7275) from the Home Office Intelligence Department on the growth of Bolshevism in the United States. Special attention is drawn to the influence of a system of foreign language federations upon the Socialist Party. The membership of these reached 50,000 (Russians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Letts, Poles, Jews, Finns, Germans, Hungarians, Bohemians (Czechs ?), Scandinavians, and Italians).
ENEMY GROUP.A USTRIA-IIFJ NO! A RY.Hungary. A wireless message from Budapest dated May 17th denies the report that Count Julius Karolyi has formed a Government at Arad.Information has been received through a Spanish source that the Hungarian Government is-engaged in secret peace negotiations with the Czecho-Slovak Govern-ment. The former is stated to be prepared to offer 300 locomotives in exchange for a daily eoal supply and to be ready to accept the frontier lines as fixed by the terms of the armistice in return for recognition (Madrid, May loth).According to the War Office Summary of Intelligence (May 20th) the situation on the Hungarian Northern front on May 17th was as follows : After the fighting on the 12th and loth of May, the Czech front withdrew to the following line in the Rimaszombath area : Nyitra  Ipoly (east of Losoncz) Apatipuszta Janosii Feled  Bimasimonyi Borsddiuidasd Apatfalva south of Miskolcz to the bend of the river Bodrog Sarosplatak-to railway junction south-east of Csap.Csccho-Slovgkia. In an interview with Mr. Gosling (Prague) Professor Marsaryk stated that equal rights and privileges with the Czechs and Slovaks would be extended to racial minorities in the Republic. Free use of their language in schools and in Parliament would lie permitted and no forcible denationalisation was contemplated. The 500,000 Ruthenes, who were mostly illiterate, would receive special treatment.Mr. Gosling reports that the German Bohemians no longer favour inclusion in Germany owing to the severity of the peace terms. The South Bohemians are believed to favour adherence to German-Austria.Teschen. The question of Teschen was discussed at a meeting of the National Assembly on May 15th. Mr. Gosling states that official and popular feeling strongly favours its incorporation in Czecho-Slovakia.GERMANY.Political Situation.  (1) General. According to a Swiss report it is rumoured that Count. Alvcnsleben has been entrusted with the task of entering into negotiations with LeniiFs Government. It is believed in communistic circles in Berne that Germany will refuse to sign the peace terms and will form an alliance with Bolshevik Russia against the Entente (Lord Acton, May 17th).(2) Munich. The town has gradually been cleared of the remaining Communists (Nauen, May 7th).- (3) Leipzig. After the close of the Leipzig Fair Government troops, in agreement with the Saxon Government, entered Leipzig under General Marker, in order to restore the authority of the Government. Their entry came as such a surprise that there was no thought of resistance. All arms were ordered to be given up. The extremist Leipzig workmen proclaimed a general strike as a protest against the presence of Government troops. The strike, however, very soon collapsed (Nauen. May 10th).(4) Stettin. Disturbances have taken place during the last few days in Stettin owing to lack of food. The people demanded the arming of the workers and the disarming of the police officials. The troops and police have been unable to restore calm, and a state of siege has been declared in Stettin (Nauen, May ISth).Potash. Combine. Sir W. Townley reports that German agents have been for some time at Rotterdam negotiating the details of a large potash combine at the Hague in which American, Dutch, British, and German capital may co-operate. The scheme includes the raising of a large foreign loan for the purchase of foodstuffs and raw materials guaranteed on the potash output,The Peace Terms. Discussion of the Peace terms continues unabated both in. the German Wireless reports and the Press.
The Conference in Berlin of German Trades Unions addresses an appeal to organised labour in all countries, in which attention is called to the strangulation of the German people which the Imperialists of the Western Powers have determined to carry out by means of the &quot;Peace Terms.&quot; Instead of the promised Peace of Justice and reconciliation which was to put an end to war, a people of 70 millions are to be made the helots ami slaves of Allied and associated capitalism. Germany is to be robbed of her best economic districts. French, Belgians ami Poles wish to seize important portions of Germany&apos;s economic and industrial products. The financial obligations will make Germany, and especially her workers, the slaves of the Allies for at least 50 years. This is the &quot; peace &quot; which the statesmen of the enemy Powers wish to impose on the German peojde after they have laid down their arms, trusting in the &quot;Peace of Justice&quot; promised by President Wilson and by all belligerents. This &quot; peace &quot; is not only the continuation by other means of the war against the German people, but signifies at the same time the struggle of Capitalism versus Socialism.A&quot;ictor Schiff addresses an open letter from Versailles to the French Socialists Avho were the great hope of the German Social Democrats. One expected in Germany, he says, a unanimous shout of indignation from all Socialist throats once the Peace conditions were published in the French Press, but the hopes which the German Social Democrats place in the French Socialists were in vain. There are in France men who call themselves Socialists and who have no word of protest to offer against the Peace terms.At a meeting of protest held by representatives of German agricultural and trade concerns it was stated that the districts to be handed over brought to Germany 33 per cent, of the total grain harvest, 20 per cent, of the total potato harvest, and 25 per cent, of the total sugar harvest, and that during the last two years these districts had supplied of their surplus to the remaining provinces of Germany 35 per cent, of pigs and 27 per cent, of sheep, that is, a total of 100,000,000 kilos of meat per annum. As a result of the demand to hand over 140,000 cows, the German people Avoulcl suffer a daily loss of 700,000 litres of milk, and thus about half a million infants Avould be deprived of their food and would die.The German Catholics have issued an appeal to the Catholics of the world to raise their voice against a peace which robs the German people of all possibility of fulfilling the role allotted to them by God.The Bavarian Assembly at Bamberg has unanimously adopted a resolution that a peace of violence should not be signed.The Conservative and Liberal papers greeted ScheidemamPs speech with enthusiasm and printed the Governments &quot;unacceptable&quot; in large letters across their front pages. herr Guttmann, the Frankfurter Zeitung&apos;s correspondent at Versailles, sees hope in the assertion that the Peace terms have created deeper dissatisfaction among the people in Allied countries than appears in the Press. He supports Mr. HendersoiPs advice to sign the Treaty in expectation of the time Avhen the Western Powers Avill become democratised. Voruxirts says that the Internationale will prove the deciding factor in the future. Kautsky in the Freihelt favours signature, and declares the growing resentment of the French people, avIio will need to keep up their armaments, and the opposition to Governments in England will eventually bring about the collapse of a peace of injustice. General von Freytag-Loringhoven, writing in the Kreuz Zeitung, takes exception to the military clauses of the Treaty and the abolition of conscription.NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.Industrial Situation.

BALTIC PROVINCES.Military Situation. (1) Front of the Esthonian Army. Mr. Bosanquet (Reval) reports that after several days&apos; reconnaissance the Northern Corps commenced its advance on Yanibnrg and Gdov on May 16th. The Bolsheviks retired in disorder with the loss of 2,000 men taken prisoners, including the General and Staff of the 3rd Brigade (19th Division), 30 machine guns, and two armoured trains. Mr. Bosan-qiiet draws attention to the shortage of hoots in the Corps, many of the men fighting without even the usual footrags. A wireless report of May 16th from Moscow admitted the loss of Gdov (on the east shore of Lake Chud), ami on the following day the Esthonians in conjunction with the Northern Corps captured Yamburg and the line of the River Luga. Detachments have entered Ivoporya and Moloskovitsi (north-west and west of Yamburg respectively).On the southern front the Bolsheviks have occupied Salishof (Moscow, May 16th), while violent fighting has taken place in the Volmar Sector (Esthonian Military Report, May 17th).An officer who has recently returned from an inspection of the Southern Esthonian front between Petchori and Salisburg draws the following picture of the army. The line is only lightly held and the Esthonians are outnumbered. Though tired out and lacking ammunition for their 3-inch and 6-inch guns, armoured cars of modern type, and all medical aid, they continue to fight. Flesh wounds become gangrenous and there are no antiseptics. Fighting is constant and heavy losses have been incurred. The men are of the farm worker class and strong and their officers efficient, They are destitute of military equipment, especially boots. The Staffs both at Verro and Rvien made requests for medicines and tobacco. They expressed great confidence in the effect of armoured cars if the latter could be provided (Mr. Bosan-quet, May 17th).Medical stores for a force of 30,000 men are being despatched to Reval (Foreign Office, May 16th).(2) Lettish Front.--An advance on Riga has commenced and troops are stated to be within 12 kilometres of the city (Mr. Grant Watson, May 16th).According to the latest telegram received, German Bait patrols have reached Riga, which is undefended. Fear is expressed in certain Esthonian circles that the capture of Riga may be the prelude to an advance into Esthonia for the purpose of paralysing the Esthonian in the same way as the Lettish national movement.Situation at Fibau. On May 12th Needra, avIio had been appointed Prime Minister in the pro-German Cabinet (vide Report No. 119, page 8), was kidnapped by some Nationalist Letts. He thereupon renounced all his rights in favour of the National Council. The latter body assembled the same clay and. passed a resolution authorising Mr. Ulmanis to resume office. A demand was sent to the German Governor to remove the Bait Guard from Government offices, and to permit the mobilisation of Lettish soldiers. The Baits, in their turn, demanded the release of Needra, threatened the arrest of Ulmanis, and condemned the meeting of the National Council as irregular. Meanwhile, they continued their efforts to paralyse all forms of Lett activity. A number of officials have been arrested on the pretext of being implicated, in the plot against Needra, Officers have been sent to the front in order to prevent their co-operation with the Allied missions at Li ban.According to the Berliner Tageblatt (May 13th) the Baits are appealing for German volunteers to enter the Bait Landwehr, and offering as a reward land and high pay. A strong anti-Allied, and especially anti-British campaign is being carried on (Mr. Grant Watson, May 13th to 18th)&apos;Fslhonia. Mr. Poska, the Foreign Minister, is proceeding to England in the near future (1) to secure specialists in agriculture, finance, and constitutional law; (2) to obtain English capital in return for economic concessions ; (3) to discuss the question of British protection.   He also intends to obtain farther help from Finland.At the first meeting of the Constituent Assembly, the President referred to the great material assistance rendered by England. His words were received with great enthusiasm (Mr. Bosanquet, May Pith and 15th).On May 11th the Commander of the Russian Corps left Libau for Berlin to purchase war material for the Northern Army in Esthonia, This constitutes further evidence of the co-operation between the Germans and the anti-Bolshevik Russians (Mr. Grant Watson, May 15th).
DENMARK.The following is the text of the resolution adopted on May 12th at a secret session of the Rigsdag hy 121 votes against 30 : &quot; While the Danish Rigsdag expresses its joy at the prospect that the impending peace will bring about the fulfilment of the hopes of the Danish natiou, it maintains its resolution of October 23rd, 1918, and the wishes with regard to the voting region in South Jutland which were put before the Allied and Associated Powers by the delegation, including all parties of the Rigsdag and by representatives of the Danish Electors&apos; Union of South Jutland. The Rigsdag is further of opinion that a vote on the basis of these wishes will give the best guarantee for the national future of the Danish people &quot; (Sir 0. Marling, May 13th).FINLAND.Bolshevik Activity. Mr. Bosanquet (Reval) has received information to the effect that Bolshevik agents have been sent to Helsingfors and Viborg and that they are well siqaplied with funds.   German agents are also reported to be active.Finnish Red Legion. The Finnish Government has agreed to meet a deputation of the Finnish Red Legion which has been operating with the forces at Murmansk, with a view to settling the conditions upon which members of the Legion may be repatriated to Finland (Mr. Bosanquet, May 16th).Russian Protest. The Russian Soviet Government has addressed a note to the Finnish G-overnment protesting against the continual attacks on Russian territory, in spite of the fact that the Russian Soviet Government has always abstained from all acts of aggression against Finland and has contined itself to legimate defence. . . . The Russian Government feels certain that the Finnish working masses will uot for long allow themselves to be used as the blind tools of the imperialist policy of the Entente, but will soon put an end to the warlike activities of the present Government of Finland (Petrograd, May 20th).MEXICO.Revolutionist Activity. Mr. Cummins has received a report that a revolutionary attack on Durango has been repulsed.A general strike against the Government commenced in the City of Mexico on May 17th as a protest against the non-payment of salaries to school teachers. The publication of newspapers has ceased owing to the strikes (Mr. Cummins, May 17th).The chief of the Presidents staff considers the Governments position precarious (Mr. Cummins, May loth).NETHERLANDS.Treaty of IS39. Sir W. Townley reports that the Minister of Foreign Affairs has left for Paris to attend discussions connected with the proposed revision of the Treaty of 1S39.SWITZERLAND.The Vorarlberg. According to a telegram received from Lord Acton the Swiss Government, though unwilling to precipitate a decision in respect of the recent plebiscite in the A7orarlberg, is veering towards some form of union. The latter is now considered as a means of helping towards counteracting Bolshevism in Switzer-land, and as the only alternative to the union of the A^orarlberg with Germany. It would also give Switzerland important railway control eastwards.THE VATICAN.German Missionaries. His Majesty&apos;s representative at the A7atican has received a Note from the Cardinal Secretary of State deploring the indiscriminate expulsion of German missionaries from China and Africa.   The Note suggests that individual cases, in which members of the missions have been guilty of anti-Allied activity, could.--be controlled, without resorting to general deportation.
