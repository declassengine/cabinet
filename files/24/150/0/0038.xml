SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN  AND GENERALREPORT No. 132.General. Mr. FfooveFs figures of coal shortage in Europe are startling (see under &quot; General&quot; and Appendix). It is understood that, as affecting ourselves, these are being checked by expert authorities. The basis of calculation for present-day production is not clear. They show, for ourselves, a present deficit of 9,000,000 tons on our annual requirements for home consumption, as compared with a surplus before the war for export purposes of 100,000,000 tons over and above home reqxurements.In the countries dealt with in the &quot; Western &quot; Report, events in the Baltic States, Hungary and China are of the greatest immediate interest.Argentine Republic. An outlet for German emigration is shown.Baltic States. There are further signs of the attitude of the German military authorities to secure German influence, and to promote a Russian policy.China. The desirability  of   avoiding  vague  terminology  about   Shantung questions has been raised by a British commercial representative at Tsing-tao. Strained relationship between China and Japan is indicated.Germany. The use of German wireless stations deserves attention, in connection with the clause of the Peace Treaty providing that for three months after ratification they are to be used only for commercial purposes, under supervision. Some special extracts are given under Hungary.Hungary. Reports received about the Rumanian occupation are given, with the authority in each case. The situation will not be clear until official reports from the Allied Generals, who have now gone to Budapest, have been received.Japan. Mr. Alston&apos;s report of Japanese policy is of special interest in connection with the Tsing-tao question.G. G. A.August 14th, 1919.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Military Operations. &quot; Wireless News &quot; (General Staff M.T...T.A., C.W.) contain the Bolshevik, Polish, Esthonian, and Rumanian Military reports. In so far as these affect the political situation in the Baltic States and in Hungary (which countries come within the province of the Western and General Report), a brief reference to them is given if they have not appeared in the Press.Naval Situation. On August Gth the First Lord of the Admiralty furnished the War Cabinet with an important memorandum on the naval situation in the Caspian, Black Sea, White Sea, and Baltic (G.T. 7911).Coal Situation in Europe.  Oh August 5th Mr. Hoover made an important statement in Paris to the Heads of the Delegations of the Five Great Powers on the subject of the coal situation in Europe.   It was resolved : &quot; That the Supreme Council should invite the British, French, Italian, Belgian, Polish and Czecho-Slovak Governments each to nominate one member to a European Coal Commission to be immediately set up to undertake the co-ordination of the production, distribution and transportation of coal throughout, Europe. The Repa-ration Commission, the Teschen Commission, the Plebiscite Commission for Silesia, and different Commissions charged with matters of transport by sea, railroad and canal, should all be instructed to co-operate with this Coal Commission, and to assist the work of the Coal Commission to the full extent of their powers.&quot;Important coal statistics put before the Heads of Delegations are given in an Appendix to this Report (H.D. 24, G.T. 7920;. It is there shown that the pre-war : annual consumption of coal in Great Britain amounted to 192,000,000 tons, and it is estimated that we are at present producing 183,000,000. Assuming that annual consumption has not increased during the war, this leaves a deficit of 9,000,000 tons instead of a surplus for exportation, which amounted to 100,000,000 tons in 1913. The corresponding deficit in Germany, according to the estimates, amounts to 4S,000,000 tons, and in France to 5G,000,000 tons. The figures are based &quot; as nearly as possible on the boundary-lines established by the Peace Treaties.&quot;ARGENTINE.German Immigration.  German Wireless reports as follows (August Gth) :  &quot; Fourty-four artisans and peasants from Bielefeld and the surrounding district have sailed for the Argentine, in order to found there, with the siipport of the Argentine Government, German agricultural colonies.    Other groups of emigrants will follow at an early date.&quot;THE BALTIC STATES.N.B. A comprehensive article, valuable for reference purposes, on the political situation in the Baltic States appeared in the New Europe last week.German Attitude. Fiirther confirmation has been received of the anti-British influence of German propaganda in the Northern Army, -which contains large numbers of Germans (Air. Bosancjuet, August Gth).The following information came from Riga-(Mr. Grant Watson), August Gth : The Press here reproduce a statement of the German Minister for Foreign Affairs that the German Minister to Lettland has telegraphed to the effect that the agreement with the Lettish Government regarding a grant of land to German soldiers for colonisation was only provisional, so that the Lettish Government did not promise land to the Germans. The German Government is not supporting the demands of the soldiers. German soldiers are prohibited from entering foreign&apos; military formations, and officers who support such proceeding will be brought before court-martial.Dvinsk Wire-less (vid Moscow, August 4th) reported that the German Staff at Mitau was preventing the circulation of &quot;progressive&quot; (&apos;? Spartacist) German newspapers. r ;     , ; ,,       - s
Attitude of General Yudenich. Mr. Bosanquet forwards a report (August Gth) that General Yudenich has refused to sign a declaration of certain Liberal proposals,, submitted to him for signature by a representative of the Esthonian Government, on the plea that the population has complained of reactionary measures taken by the Russian Army authorities. The reason alleged is that General Yudenich&apos;s sub-ordinates hold reactionary views.Proposed Conferences.-(See Western, Report No. 130, page 2). Mr. Grant Watson (Riga) reported on August 7th a forthcoming conference on frontiers, political relationship, finance, military questions, &amp;c, between the Esthonians and the Letts. Apparently the first step will be for each of the States to arrange for a similar form of relationship with its neighbours, with a view to a future federation of Esthonia, Finland, Lithuania, and Latvia. Such a confederation would have a common interest in combating the hostility of Russia (under whatever form of government), and of Germany. The frontier between Lithuania and Poland is likely to cause trouble. The Letts are opposed to Poland joining the League, but a Polish diplomatic repre-sentative is expected to come to Riga soon in order to discuss the. best means of co-operating with the Baltic States against the Russian Bolsheviks.Channel for Military Reports. Diplomatic representatives at Helsingfors, Riga, and Reval have been instructed to forward through General Gough all military information destined for the Foreign Office (Foreign Office, August 11th).Latvia and Courland. The Lettish Foreign Minister has instructed the London and Paris Legations to press for financial help and certain army stores required to retrieve a situation considered desperate, and to meet tbe needs for offensive operations against the Bolsheviks.Esthonia. A letter dated August 8th from the Admiralty to the Foreign Office, on the situation in Esthonia, has been put before the War Cabinet (G.T. 7051). The following is an extract:  &quot;It is considered that the present situation in Esthonia is not all that can be desired, and that this is considerably affected by the situation existing in the Russian North-Western Army. The latter is consistently requesting the despatch of further stores and munitions, and Mr. Bosanquet reports that the non-arrival of these stores is having a marked effect on the troops.&quot; Bolshevik agents and the local pro-Bolshevik Press are busy fostering the idea of peace between Esthonia and Soviet Russia, and this idea appears to be gaining ground. The Esthonian Government at the same time fears an advance in the direction of Minsk by the Russian North-Western Army, which would open the front and decide the fate of Esthonia. On the other hand, Yudenitch fears that the Esthonian Army is veering to the left. The Esthonian Minister of Foreign Affairs states that, unless Esthonia is recognised by the Allies, it will be difficult to induce the troops to do more than stand on the defensive, and that such is difficult to maintain for any length of time.&quot;The Senior Naval Officer in the Baltic pressed strongly for a pronouncement about the future status of the country, because the uncertainty was producing the most serious influence upon the situation.Recognition of Esthonia  Information sent by Mr. Bosanquet (August Gth) tends to show that the Esthonian Government would not be content with the recognition of the independence of Esthonia by General Yudenich ; recognition by Koltchak would also be required.CHINA.Manchuria.. Reports from Sir J. Jordan (August Gth-lOth) and Mr. Alston (August 8th) show the continuance of trouble, strikes, and apparently Bolshevik tendencies in Manchuria. . The Chinese Foreign Minister appears to be doing his best to suppress propaganda and to get the workmen back on the railway. The Japanese General Staff deny all complicity in the trouble.Shantung (Tsing-lao) Qi.testion.-Ou. August 10th Sir J. Jordan forwarded..an urgent representation from a representative of British commerce that care should be exercised in geographical nomenclature applied to Shantung, Kiab-chou- and Tsing-tao respectively, as applied to Japanese claims in connection with former German occupation.
Chinese Eastern Railway. Sir J. Jordan thinks that it is undesirable, in view of the present state of relationship between China and Japan, for Japanese troops to be sent in large numbers via tire Chinese Eastern Railway-. Stoppages on this line are possible owing to strikes, to suppress which Japanese troops might intervene.. Reliefs for Japanese troops at Chita might, it is considered, be either deferred or sent by the Amur route (August 10th).DENMARK.Slesvig. M. Clemenceau on August 3rd informed the Danish Minister in Paris that in the opinion of the Supreme Council &quot; the presence in Danish waters of the British warship now there and of the French warship which is about to arrive, would be sufficient to maintain order. The British Admiral commanding the naval forces-will, furthermore, be competent to gauge the state of affairs at Flensburg and empowered to take the necessary steps,&quot; and that the expenses connected with the inter-Allied military and naval occupation, during the time of the plebiscite, will be included in the general expenses incurred by reason of the plebiscite.FRANCE.French Press. On August 5th Sir G. Grahame drew attention to articles in the French Press containing accusations against British agents in Syria of &quot;unbearable-behaviour &quot; and anti-French policy. On August 7th, to reports of a French judicial mission leaving for Persia &quot;at the request of the Persian Government.&quot; On the same date to a further article on Syria and on. the renewal of diplomatic relations with the Vatican hi this connection. On August 9th&apos;to further articles on Syria, accusing British agents of behaving &quot;as if they had one object, namely, to eject France from Syria.&quot;   On the same date, to an article on the Morocco question.Repatriation of Russians from France. Sir G. Grahame on August 9th gave-the substance of an explanation by the Foreign Ministry on French policy in repatriating Russians via Odessa.Adjournment of Chamber and Senate. The Chamber adjourned on August 10th until the 26th, when M. BarthorPs report on the Peace Treaty will be discussed.   The-.Senate adjourned until September 4th (Sir G. Grahame, August .10th).FINLAND.Advance on Petrograd. Finnish co-operation in such an advance appears to be-very unlikely (F.O., August 12th).GERMAN Y. (Official Reports.)Crews of German Merchant Ships. The German representatives on the-Commission at Rotterdam on Shipping are making enquiries about the present wdiereabouts and prospects of repatriation of the crews of the German merchant ships which were taken over during the war in Brazil and Uruguay waters (Foreign Office,. August 12th).(Wireless Neivs.)German Policy in Eastern Provinces, Baltic Stales, and Russia. The following is-from Warsaw Wireless (August 6th): &quot;The Germans, in violation of the peace treaty, removed all State property from the territories assigned to Poland. They also took steps to export the harvest to Germany. Arms and munitions in large quantities were exported by the Germans to the Russian Bolsheviks, and German instructors are being sent to the Red Armies. Trained troops are being also despatched to reinforce the Bolshevik front against the Poles. In view of these facts,, it is absolutely necessary that the Entente establish at once strict control over the means of communication, especially between Dvinsk and Mitau.&quot;German Capital in Neutral Countries. According to the Swedish Press, Herr-Erzberger proposes with help of Allies to bring under control of German Government. German capital lying in neutral countries.   Capital thus obtained to be confiscated and  handed over to Allies as part payment of  Germany&apos;s debt (Mr. Ramsay,. August .11th).
zCoal Crisis in Germany. A great Conference on tlie coal crisis in Germany was opened on Wednesday under the presidency of the Prime Minister, Bauer. Measures were proposed for averting the coal crisis which is threatened in winter. Besides the State Commissary for Coal, representatives were present of the employers&apos; associa-tions and Workers&apos; organisations in various industries, together with delegates of the Trades and Railway Unions. The newspapers emphasise the importance of the Conference, as the coal crisis is a European problem which should be treated from the standpoint of general reconstruction. The question of coal is vital in the matter of European industries. The decrease of England&apos;s coal output is a great danger for all European countries besides Germany. The settlement of the coal problem would free the way for a practical policy of reconstruction in contrast to the adventurous plans for a world revolution (German Wireless, August 7th).Negotiations with Poland. In connection with the negotiations between Germany and Poland, Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung writes that the German Government have received a reply from the Entente, intimating their complete agreement with the opening of the negotiations, although insisting on the necessity of the Allied and Associated Governments being represented at the negotiations as guarantors of the Peace Treaty. It is to be assumed that the German Government will not object to the participation of the Entente (German Wireless, August Sth).Prince Max of Baden and the Military Party.. The further allegations published by Prince Max of Baden against the German Supreme Command are arousing-enormous interest in Germany. The reactionary Press endeavours by means of personal aspersions to lessen the weight of the Prince&apos;? reproaches (August 10th).Official Bavarian Documents. The Gorman Commission which drew up the Memorandum on tbe question of responsibility for the war, now publishes a state-ment to the effect that at the time of the drawing up of the Memorandum the Commission were merely aware of the presence of considerable errors in the wording of the report of the Bavarian Minister von Schoen. From the latteFs recent statements in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung it appears that the erroneous interpretation of the report is due to the omission of essential passages- of. the original report. These passages prove again that the Imperial Government did not desire war, but made every effort to localise the conflict between Austria and Serbia and avoid all the occasions of a European war. The extraordinary delay in the publication of these explanations is attributed by von Schoen to the fact that after fruitless searches in the archives of Berlin and Munich, the documents were but recently discovered in the possession of EisueFs widow (August 7tb).Wireless Developments in Germany. The German Postal Administration is planning the development of Germany&apos;s wireless system hy means of connections between Berlin and the greater towns, which, in their turn, are to be linked up with the smaller stations. Wireless telegraph receiving stations for messages from Berlin would be of great service to the Press, as a single despatch from Berlin would be sufficient for distribution over the whole of Germany. Newspaper editors would have their own receiving apparatus (August .10th).Situation in Hungary. Following earlier implications that the British had approached the ex-Emperor Charles with a view to replacing him on the throne in Hungary, the following are samples of the use of the Nauen wireless station for propaganda purposes: &quot;According to unconfirmed reports the Allies have consented to send a cletach-ment numbering 5,000 to Buda Pest for driving out the Rumanians &quot; (August 5th).&quot; The Berlin Press considers the terms which the Rumanians think they can impose on Hungary are due to the atmosphere bred by the Entente themselves, which is not one of understanding or justice, but one of violence and Imperialism&quot; (August Sth).League of Nations. The German Peace Society has started a fresh campaign of popular propaganda for the revision of the Peace Treaty on the basis of the League of Nations. Public opinion in Germany is in favour of this propaganda, as the only difference of opinion between the Majority Socialists and the Bourgeois Democrats is on the question&quot; of socialisation and not on the question of an anti-military policy, -which is regarded by all as absolutely necessary for Germany (August Sth).S709-2b B
HUNGARY.Diary of Events. August 2nd. Mr. Rattigan wired from Bucharest that the President of the Transylvanian Council had absolute proof nine-tenths of Hungarian Bolsheviks were against die Bolsheviks and would welcome Allied, or even Rumanian, intervention. M. Maniu said that he was anxious to establish good relations with Hungary, but this was naturally impossible as long as Bela Kun continued in power. (This message was not received until August Sth.) Maniu thought that the strength of the Bolshevik Army had been greatly over-estimated, and that its overthrow would, in spite of long delay which had taken place, even then be matter of no great difficulty. General Greenly was of the same opinion. On the same date a wireless message, claiming to emanate from Budapest, was issued by the Russian Official Wireless, containing a violent appeal by the new Government against the &quot; Imperialists of the Entente ;&apos; for breaking the terms of the Armistice.August 4th.. A Rumanian Army report was alleged to have been issued, con-taining the following words : &quot; Budapest was occupied by us to-day on strategic grounds. Hungary, entirely occupied by us, is to be considered as garrison territory. The Rumanian King set out to-day for Budapest.&quot;[The precedent of the identical wording &quot;on strategic grounds&quot; in the ex-KaiseFs personal message to President Wilson on August 10th, 1914, explaining the violation of Belgian neutrality, will be noted.]August oth. Mr. Rattigan reported the occupation of Budapest by Rumanian troops on August 4th, and expressed some anxiety about the probable attitude of the Rumanian troops towards the population. On the same date, the following official report was issued by wireless from the Rumanian headquarters at Budapest to the military authorities at Bucharest : &quot; The inhabitants at Budapest welcomed our troops with flowers and great satisfaction.&quot; The greatest calmness reigns over the city, order being completely assured.&quot; holban,&quot; General Commanding the (Budapest) Group.&quot;On August titli Vienna Wireless stated, on the authority of the Neuer Tag, that Pomanelli had declared that the Rumanian Army occupied Budapest without con-sulting the Entente. The newspaper also circulated the rumour that the Szegedin Government proposed that Ferdinand should be King of Hungary.German Wireless of the same date published the following : Budapest is now occupied not only by Rumanian but also by Entente troops. French troops entered on Tuesday and the English and Americans on Wednesday. A Czecho-Slovak division also marched into Budapest. In consequence of the occupation of almost the whole of Hungary by the Rumanians, no more food reaches the capital. All railway communication in Hungary is at a standstill. The new Hungarian Government has not yet been formed, as the bourgeois parties refuse at present to enter the Cabinet and are awaiting the results of the new elections. Only the representative of the agricultural classes has declared his readiness to enter the Cabinet. The War Minister of the Szegedin Government, Goemboers, has refused to recognise the new Government in Budapest, and makes no secret of the fact that all counter-revolutionary attempts have originated in Szegedin. In connection with the Rumanian Armistice conditions which are to be fulfilled by August loth, the Hungarian Government decided to submit a copy of the Rumanian demands to the English General Gordon, with the comment that the Hungarian Government were not in a position to fulfil them.On the same date His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Bucharest reported (received August 13th) as follows: &quot; I am informed that Rumanian troops on entering Budapest were received, if not with enthusiasm, at any rate with apparent satisfaction by Hungarian population, who were evidently relieved to be freed from the terrorism of the Bolsheviks.&quot;On August 1th German Wireless stated : &quot; The transfer of supreme power in Hungary to the Archduke Joseph by the Entente gives rise to the view among German bourgeois and socialist republicans that it is but a prelude to the restoration of the monarchy in Hungary and probably in German-Austria also.&quot;
tAugust Sth. Mr. Rattigan sent a reinsuring report (received August 11th), about orders given to the Rumanian troops about their treatment of the Hungarian people. A diplomatic representative from Rumania had been sent to Budapest to see that ill-treatment of the Hungarian people did not take place. The following is a sample of the policy still adopted by German Wireless, as in the war, of using extracts from the Press for propaganda purposes : &quot; Referring to the appointment of the Archduke Joseph, the Wiener Allgemcine Zeitung gathers that the English Government at first negotiated with the ex-Emperor Karl, who, however, declined to assume power, as notwithstanding his honest intentions, he had not succeeded in preventing the collapse of the monarchy. Further, as the former Emperor-King, he could hardly reconcile himself to the position of mere ruler of Hungary. The newspaper adds that after the refusal of the Emperor Karl the English Government approached the Duke of Hoheuburg, son of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, but without success. Only then was the Archduke Joseph approached.&quot;August 9th. Vienna Wireless contained the following: &quot; The Neue Wiener Tageblatt has been authorised by the Entente to deny the statement that Entente Conferences concerning the restoration of the Hapsburg Monarchy have taken place ; even during the last events in Hungary the Entente did not in any way intervene. The Entente representatives will vigorously give the lie to all such propaganda.&quot;The tension between the Entente representative, General Gordon, and the Rumanian Supreme Command is increasing. The Rumanians declare they cannot pay any attention to the Entente.&quot;Foreign Property in Hungary. The date by which the declaration of property owned by foreigners in Hungary must be made has been put off until August 31st (Sir R. Rumbold, on authority of Spanish Consul at Budapest, August 11th).&quot; Marxism&quot; in Hungary. The Ministry of Labour report for the week ending on August Gth called attention to an article by Colonel Wedgwood, ALP., in Forward, expressing the opinion that the strength of the revolution lay in Budapest, and that even there it was only maintained by force and terror.* ITALY.Adjournment of Chamber. Sir R. Rodd on August 10th reported the adjourn merit of the Chamber on the previous evening until August 28th, after having disposed of the Electoral Reform Bill.   Final modifications, after their acceptance by the Government, were passed, majority 161.Whitehead Works at Fiume. The question of the Whitehead works has been the subject of communication between Sir R. Rodd and the Foreign Office (August Sth).JAPAN.Tsing-tao. The question of the action of the Japanese military authorities towards the Asiatic Petroleum Company and Standard Oil Company at Tsing-tao has been raised (Mr. Alston, July 30th, received August 10th).Message from former American Ambassador. On August Gth Mr. Alston gave an account of a message sent by Mr. Potter (once American Ambassador at Tokio) to the Assistant Foreign Minister. Strong language is used in this message about Japanese militarist policy.&quot;Shantung&quot; Policy. Mr. Alston on August Sth reported the Foreign Ministers statement of August 1th on policy (see last week&apos;s Report), and forwarded a precis of what he understood to be the Japanese understanding of the economic privileges which they were taking over from Germany. It appears that the area for settlement is not likely to be limited to the present boundaries of Tsing-tao. [Further important details are given in Cable 329 of August Sth.]Ratification of Peace Treaty. The Japanese Government is expected to ratify some time next month (Mr. Alston, August Sth).MONTENEGRO:Serbian Policy. Count de Salis on August 3rd (received Oth) sent further reports of terrorism against villagers, including slaughter of stock, if they will not agree to incorporation under the Serbian dynasty.
sNETHERLANDS.Negotiations with Belgium. The public are reported to be becoming more and more nervous about the negotiations in Paris. His Majesty&apos;s Government is credited with supporting the Netherlands case (Mr. Robertson, August Sth). German exploitation of Dutch fears is indicated.NORWAY.League of Nations. On August 6th Mr. Ovey reported the substance of a conversation with the Prime Minister on Mr. Colban&apos;s appointment, which the Prime Minister took as a compliment to Norway. Mr. Ovey expressed the opinion that Norway, as an independent Sovereign State, was quite ready to join the League of Nations. He described difficulties arising over proposals circulated about a Scandinavian groirp, dominated by Sweden.Russian Refugees. The Norwegian Consul at Archangel has recommended that well-to-do Russians should be allowed to take refuge in Norway. [This would simplify the North Russian evacuation.]PERU.Recognition. The French diplomatic representative has been authorised to recognise the Government formally. American and Italian Ministers are ready to do so, although not officially authorised (Air. Manners, August 7th).POLAND.Poles from North Russia. The repatriation of all Poles from Archangel to Poland is contemplated (Mr. Hoare, August 5th).*German Aeroplane. The following was reported by German Wireless on August 6th: &quot; In Upper Silesia the Poles have shot clown a giant aeroplane belonging to a German firm, which was on its way to Podolia. It had been lent to the Ukrainian Government, and was carrying Ukrainian money and official papers.&quot;Organisation of Polish Police. A British Mission is desired by M. Paderewski to help in this purpose (Sir P. Wyndham, Warsaw, August 6th).Mission to Berlin. This Mission was expected to leave Posen for Berlin on August 10th (Polish wireless).   The arrival in Berlin has been reported.Mission to Poland on Jewish Question. His Majesty&apos;s Government proposes to send an independent Alission to Poland to study the relationship between Poles and dews (Foreign Office to Sir P. Wyndham, August 9th):Military Operations. The occupation by Polish troops of Sluck on August 9th, and of Minsk on the Sth, was reported by Sir P. Wyndham on the 9th.Relationship with Lithuania. In view of the importance of co-operation against the Russian Bolsheviks, the Bishop of Riga and others have suggested terms of provisional agreements to settle the differences between Poland and Lithuania (Mr. Grant Watson, Riga, August 10th).SERBIA.Resignation of President of the Council. The resignation of the President of the Council was hauded to the Crown Prince on August 1st (Sir C. des Graz, August 2nd, received 10th). A Press Bureau message from Belgrade, intercepted on August 4th, adds : &quot; Iiis Highness Prince Alexander has accepted the collective resignation of the Cabinet presented yesterday by the Prime Minister Protitch. The Ministers will continue to carry on their duties until a new Government has been formed.&quot;[According to an intercepted wireless message from Madrid on August 4th, Spain Iras recognised the Serbo-Croat-Slovene State.]
SWEDEN.Relationship zoith Bolshevik Russia,. Mr. Ramsay on August Stli called attention to an article in Politiken urging Sweden to resume business, relations, ivith Russia before the market has been captured by other countries. On August Oth he added that, according to the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, the Bolsheviks were asking the Swedish Government to facilitate the shipment of babies (sic) to Stockholm.SWITZERLAND.League of Nations. The following is an extract from German Wireless of August 7th : &quot; The Swiss Federal Council has decided to lay before the next Federal Meeting in September an article on the League of Nations, for inclusion in the Constitution. The article sets forth that Switzerland adheres to the League of Nations Treaty, as it figures in the Peace Treaty between the Allies and Germany. The conditions laid down by the Federal Constitution for the approval of State Treaties -will be applied in ratifying the conclusions of the 26th article of the Treaty of the League of Nations, which are open to revision. . Decisions concerning accession to or retirement from the Treaty are to be submitted to a plebiscite.&quot;Strikes. The strike at Basle has collapsed. The dismissal of ringleaders is being insisted upon by employers. The casualties have been Jive killed and 20 -wounded. The situation at Zurich seems to be improving. &quot;Large classes of the population have been exasperated by the strikers, and the peasants had to be persuaded not to cut off the milk supply of the towns.(Sir 1:1. Rumbold, August 7th).THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Abyssinian Mission. Mr. Lindsay on August 6th reported that the Mission had not attracted much attention. The Government of the United States have not received any request from the Mission. The League of Nations question may be raised by the Crown Prince when he visits America.Acute Industrial Crisis. On August Gth-Oth Mr. Lindsay reported upon the acute industrial crisis, and gave the substauce of the Presidents address to the Senate on August Sth about the cost of living, and measures to be taken provisionally to check it.Trade with Russia. German Wireless (August Oth) reported: &apos;attention is called in the German Press to a report that a commission of American merchants in Archangel has entered into negotiations with the Soviet authorities concerning the resumption of regular trade. It has been arranged that America shall supply Russia food, agricultural machines, and raw material, while Russia is to grant concessions to America in the reconstruction of the country and commercial undertakings.&quot; [N.B.  Similar reports of trade via Petrograd have been received from Sweden.]VATICAN.Publication of Documents. Mr. Gaisford was informed on August Sth that if the Vatican concurred, papers would be laid in Parliament on. August 11th, and that the British Government did not object to publication of the record proposed. (Referred to in the last Western Report under Vatican, ErzbergeFs Disclosures), The Vatican concurred on August Oth.Repatriation of German Prisoners. The Vatican is taking an interest in the question of hastening repatriation (Mr. Gaisford, August 12th)..s-py-2ic
PEACE DISCUSSIONS.Peace Conference.
