SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND GENERALREPORT No. I OS.General (page 2).Information lias come in from many sources during the current week about unrest and third-party crimes. In seeking for possible motives instigating such crimes, it is of interest to note that they have been freely exploited and openly advocated by two influences, Bolshevism (in all countries in the world) and Prussian &quot; militarism &quot; (in all countries hostile to that influence). In connection with the latter, the extract in the Appendix is of special interest. Other matter on this subject will be found under &quot;General&quot; on page 2, &quot;Germany&quot; (Assassinations), on page 6, &quot; Finland &quot; (Bolshevism) on page 8, &quot;Mexico&quot; (ditto) on page 8, &quot; Norway &quot; (ditto) on page 9, and &quot; Sweden &quot; (ditto) on page 10.Other matters of special interest are : the indications of German policy, which seems to be directed towards regaining control of the Baltic Provinces, especially Courland (Libau), referred to on page 7 ; and the reception of the League of Nations Covenant, referred to under &quot; General,&quot; &quot; United States of America,&quot; and &quot; Germany.&quot;Allied Countries. Portugal (page 4). Disorders continue in Lisbon.United Stales of America (page 4). The Irish Convention at Philadelphia report is of interest, in view of the influential names cpioted.Enemy Countries.Austria-Hungary (page 5). Food shortage and unsettlement continue. The trouble between Italy and the Southern Slavs has led to interruption of railway communication with Vienna.Germany (page 6). The situation in Bavaria, as affecting the general situation in the country, is of special interest at this stage. It looks as if the murder of Eisner may have far-reaching effects, and shake the whole fabric of Government established at Weimar.The Danzig reports should be read in conjunction with the indications of German policy in the Baltic Provinces given under &quot; Courland &quot; on page 7.Neutral Countries.Baltic Provinces (page 7). The matter given under &quot; Livonia &quot; about a proposed combination to combat the Bolsheviks is of special interest (see also under &quot; Finland &quot;),
also the general notes about the conduct of. German troops in Lithuania. Those in Courland are said to be of a better class. The Baltic Provinces are now between the Bolshevik menace on the one hand and the possibility of an attempt to establish German domination on the other.Netherlands (page 8). Belgian claims in Paris have produced a bad impression on Dutch opinion.The question of passage of Allied troops both ways across Dutch territory seems now to be in process of settlement.9Spain (page 9). The Barcelona situation was dealt with promptly by the Government, and order appears to have been re-established. Count Romanones&apos; resignation has not been accepted.Peace Discussions (page 10).Attention is drawn to the supplementary list of Foreign Office Grey Books, prepared in connection with the Peace Conference. The diary of events in Paris is continued from former Reports.The question of disposal of surplus arms and ammunition has arisen, as affecting backward races in Africa and elsewhere. There may be a prosxsect of the Great Powers at last coming to an agreement on a question debated for many years, and affecting most seriously the British Empire, which contains so large a proportion of such subjects.G G  KFebruary 27th, 1919.N.B. Owing to shortage of staff, due to illness, it has not been possible to embody the very voluminous German Wireless in this week&apos;s Report. It is still full of propaganda.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Third-Party Crimes. In view of the recent assassinations of Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Kurt Eisner, and the Amir of Afghanistan, attempt on the life of M. Clemenceau, and plot to assassinate President Wilson, an account of the policy prescribed in such matters in the German War Book may be of interest. Extracts are given in an Appendix to this Report.Bolshevism. The Secretary of State for War has put forward a Memorandum (G.T. 6857), dated January 28th, by Mr. Basil Thomson, on the progress of Bolshevism in Europe. In addition to Russia, Rumania and Bulgaria, which countries do not come within the scope of the Western Report, the Memorandum deals with Germany, Scandinavia and Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Prance, Holland, Belgium, Italy, Spain, German-Austria, Czecho-Slovakia, England, the United States and Portugal. The Memorandum amplifies the reports from the same authority put forward by the Home Secretary, and embodied in Appendices to Western and General Reports Nos. 102 and 104. The report is of considerable interest in the existing circumstances of widespread outrage and third-party crime. The following is an extract about Germany : Evidence is accumulating tliafc, except in the Hanseatic towns, the Spartaoist movement, if not actually under control, can be put down at any moment, and that the old military authorities are designedly allowing it some rope. In no other way is it possible to explain the fact that the personnel of the old Secret Service is still intact and amply supplied with funds, which are being devoted almost entirely to Bolshevik propaganda in Allied countries. There are no doubt two motives, first, to break np the Allies before an indemnity is imposed on Germany, and, secondly (though this is conjectural), to produce such a revulsion of feeling among the bourgeoisie that a restoration of the monarchy might become possible.On the other hand, it is quite clear that the old respect shown to officers is disappearing. The tendency seems to be in the direction of consultation between the officers and men on the subject of food, leave and disciplinary measures, and. to obtain the concurrence of the rank and tile in the orders issued by the officers.Access to the Baltic. Lord Derby on February ^Oth drew attention to an article in the Temps of the same date, raising the question of German control of access to the Baltic, and advocating the formation of a new State comprising coastal provinces (specified) &quot; which would constitute a kind of Holland at the mouths of the Ems, Weser, and Elbe.&quot;Relaxation of Trade Restrictions. Trade has been authorised by general license with Turkey, Bulgaria, and Black Sea ports (Foreign Office to Admiral Webb, feburary 22nd). Trade relations have been resumed with Serbia and Rumania (F.O., February 25th). Trade with the Adriatic coast, Albania, Montenegro and J ugo-Slavia, after due consideration, is to be ox^ened from March 1st (message through Lord Derby, February 20th, and F.O. reply of 25th ; also Astoria of same date). The Supreme Economic Council is considering the removal of restrictions about trade, black lists, and censorship in South America (message through Lord Derby, February 20th).Supreme Economic Council. Lord Robert Cecil has been appointed Chief British Delegate, and arrangements have been made for Economic Advisory Committees, representing all departments concerned, to advise on British and on Empire policy respectively.Propaganda. A comprehensive report (G.T. 6839) has been issued by Lord NorthclihVs Department of Propaganda in Enemy Countries, showing the methods adopted and definite results obtained in influencing the issue of the Avar.League of Nations. Proposals have been initiated by the Neutrals League of Nations Union to call together a conference in Switzerland.   The British League of
ALLIED GROUP.BRAZIL.Visit of British Fleet. A desire has been expressed by the British Chamber of Commerce at Rio that a visit should be paid to Brazil by a British Fleet (Sir A. Peel, February 24th).CHINA.National Defence Bureau. The status of this bureau, as tending to enable the North to dominate the South, is continuing to attract attention, and there is a demand for its abolition, and the disband men t of troops it has raised (Sir J. Jordan, February I9th-22ud ; F.O., February 24th).Chinese Hallways. The Japanese proposals for control seem to be in abeyance, in view of Chinese objections and the fact that the French, Italians, and British have not yet accepted tbe proposals (Sir C. Greene, February 23rd).Treaty Obligations to Russia. The question of the observance of such obligations by China has been raised by the Japanese and Russian Ministers in Pekin (Sir J. Jordan, February 22nd). The desire for an outlet for Mongolia seems to be indicated.Repatriation of Coolies. The Government is willing that 300 should return under special conditions, affording a guarantee against the spreading of Bolshevism (Sir J. Jordan, 25th February).FRANCE.Attitude to Neutrals. On February 21st (received 25th) Lord Derby called attention to an article by M. Gauvain in the Journal des Debats advocating a distinction being made between neutrals, especially those who during the war showed &quot; more or less open sympathy with Germany, but since the.victory of the Entente have suddenly become profuse in their expression of goodwill towards France.&quot;Russian Policy. On February 23rd Lord Derby drew attention to an article by M. Herve in Victoire advocating help against Bolshevism and making suggestions for tbe constitution of a Russian National Committee in Paris, financial assistance to the committee for equipping, arming, and feeding anti-Bolshevik forces, and the despatch to Finland of all anti-Bolshevik Russian officers and men in France.Attitude towards Germany. On February 24th M. Herve in Victoire advocated the immediate despatch of food to Germany to avert famine and Bolshevism (Lord Derby, February 24th).German Austria. Both the Temps and Journcd des Debats express disquietude about the prospective incorporation with Germany (Lord Derby, February 24th).ITALY.War Material for Poland.-Th.e cession of such material by Italy has been approved by the Italian Government, and instructions issued.Release of Non-Italian Prisoners in &quot;Tripoli (Misurata). In Ariew of the questions recently raised about release of British and Greek prisoners, Sir R. Rodd suggests indicating the solidarity of the Allied Powers in a combined demand for execution of the Armistice terms in this region (February 22nd).Nations Union lias been invited to send representatives. It is expected that Germans in Switzerland will attend. The Draft Covenant (see under &quot; Peace Discussions &quot; in former Reports) having already been supported by representatives of fourteen Govern-ments, the consultation of neutral representatives at Paris on this Covenant is under consideration (Foreign Office 208 to Astoria, February 24th).
Franco-Italian Street Conflict at Leghorn. A conflict leading&apos; to loss of life has taken place between French and Italian soldiers (Sir R. Rodd, February 23rd). [It is particularly important that there should be no reference to these disturbances in the Press (Sir R. Rodd and Lord Derby, February 25th).]Representation in Asia Minor. In view of French occupation, a desire has been expressed for Italian participation (Sir R. Rodd, February 23rd).PORTUGAL.Lisbon. As a result of a demand by Extremists (Republican), followed by some fighting, the police have given up their arms. The Extremists also demand the dissolution of Congress.  Disorders had not ceased on February 22nd (Sir L. Carnegie)..     SIAM.   -Purchase of War Stores. The Government seems to be contemplating the purchase of submarines, &amp;c. (Sir H. Dering, February 21st).SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.General. The Serbian Government has proposed to President Wilson that lie should arbitrate on the questions of Trieste, the Istrian coast, and Gorizia (Sir C. des Graz, February 19th).Montenegro. Steps have been taken to acquaint the French Government that owing to demobilisation, no battalion of British troops is available for Cattaro to relieve American troops (Lord Derby, February 19th, 20th and reply of 23rd).The British and French Governments favour Allied occupation of Montenegro, with a view to finding out the real wishes of the population (Lord Derbv, February 19th).Serbia. Considerable commercial activity is being dispkvyed by the Associated Nations (Sir C. des Graz, February 25th). [See also under Austria-Hungary, Food Supplies^]UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.League of Nations. Senator Poiudexter has fiercely attacked the League of Nations covenant. Senators Knox and Lodge have said that they would await an explanation promised by President Wilson (Mr. Barclay, February 19th), and Senators Borah (Republican) and Reed (Democrat) took a similar line to Poindexter, and were much applauded by both sides. Public opinion is said to be forming against the abandonment of the policy hitherto adhered to by the United States. Mr. Taft continues to advocate the League (Mr. Barclay, February 22nd).President Wilson&apos;s speech on return to America was reported in full in The Times of February 26th,  The following summary accompanied the report : (i) From the Peace Conference the President received &quot; very happy memories.&quot;The work may appear to be going slowly, but &quot; no one decision can prudently be made which is not properly linked in with the great series of other decisions which must accompany it,&quot; and full inquiry is there-fore necessary. The moderateness of those representing national claims was remarkable.(ii) American prestige had risen very high in Europe because &quot; there is no. nation in Europe that suspects the motives of the United States,&quot; and also because Europe had seen that &quot; America not only held ideals, but acted ideals.&quot;dii) This confidence which America had won in Europe laid a burden upon the American people. If America failed the world now &quot; men will be thrown back on the bitterness of despair,&apos;.&apos; and &quot; all nations will set up hostile camps again,&quot; while the new States will be left unprotected and helpless.(iv) The arrangements for peace could not stand for a generation if not &quot; guaranteed by the united forces of the world.&quot; j
Mexico. It appears probable that political capital will be made by the Republican Party out of the results attributed to President Wilson&apos;s policy towards Carranza (No. 67, February 19th).Irish. Face Convention at Philadelphia. The following are extracts from a report received of the proceedings which were presided over by Justice Colahan of the Supreme Court of New York. The meeting was attended by Cardinal Gibbons and many Roman Catholic Bishops :  &quot; A form was adopted by Convention consisting of five points. The. 2nd point-states that the United States Government and Associated Governments are bound in honour to apply self-determination to Ireland ; the 3rd point calls attention to the failure of British rule in Ireland ; the 4th declares that the condition of Ireland is au international scandal, and constant menace to the world&apos;s peace. The Sth, after declaring that a state of war exists between England and Ireland which makes permanent world peace impossible till the Irish question is settled on principle of self-determination, demands that the President should support such settlement in the Peace Conference, and should urge (V) the reception of Irish delegates. The speakers at this meeting included a Hindu, Laptai Rai, who compared the tyrannical British rule in India with that in Ireland, Bishop Gallagher of Detroit, who made a violent speech. Rabbi Kranskope of Philadelphia, and E. J. Gavegan ; sympathetic messages were sent by Senators Borah, Walsh, Watson, and Hitchcock.  &quot;&quot;A fund of $1,250,000 was pledged by delegates to aid the movement for Irish freedom, and to mould sentiment for Irish self-determination.&quot;ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.German-Austria. The War Office Daily Summary for February 20th (No. SOS) contains valuable information about the economic situation. The most serious factor is the shortage of coal due to strikes -and disturbances. There is a general disintegration-clination to work. Rectification of the currency and provision of interest on State, loans after April are the two main financial problems.Supply of Food to Vienna. Difficulties between Italians and Southern Slavs have led to delays in railway transport between Laybach and Vienna. British and American members of the Food Commission have visited Rome about the matter (Sir R. Rodd, February 25th).Strikes in Hungary. According to Austrian Wireless reports of February 20th the strike of employees and workers continues in the whole of Northern Hungary. Railways, post, telegraph, electricity works, all public and private enterprises and businesses, cafes and gas works, are at a standstill.Control of Danube Navigation by Czecho-Slovaks. It has been suggested that this question should await consideration and report by the Inter-Allied Commission of the Paris Conference on International Waterways (Foreign Office to Sir C. des Graz, February 20th).Food Supplies. Sir C. des Graz has represented (February 2.1st) the importance to Belgrade and Serbia generally of the food supplies of Batchka and the Banat, in connection with a proposal to supply bacon and maize from these resources to the German-Austrian Food Controller.[See also under &quot;Switzerland, Ilevictualling of the Tyrol.&quot;]Gzecho-Slovah Frontier. This frontier was closed from February 25th for a short time for certain financial reasons (Lord Derby, February 24th). An emissary has been sent by the Czecho-Slovak Government to the Polish Commission of the Peace Conference to confer and give information about the Teschen situation (Sir 11. Rumbold, February 25th).
GERMANY.Inner Change in Germany. The Political Intelligence Department on February 14th issued a further Memorandum (G.T. GS77) embodying views on (.1) incoherence . and instability of the new Parties, (2) Socialists and Bourgeois Democrats, and (3) Renunciation of principles of the old Regime. Instances are given of the suppression by the military authorities of all expressions of honest opinion. On February 14th Sir II. Rumbold furnished information pointing to the continuance of the old methods of misleading the German people. On February 20th the P.I.D. issued a Memc-ranclum (G.T. GS9J) on GJerman Forecasts, treating the subject under the headings (1) Consolations, (2) Foreign Policy. Emigration on a large scale is considered inevitable under the hard economic conditions of the near future. The Swiss Minister in Berlin takes a gloomy view of the situation (Sir II. Rumbold, February 25th).Merchant Shipbuilding. The Admiralty reported (No. 375, February 20th), that work on merchant steamers was proceeding actively both at. Bremen and Hamburg.Assassinations. According to a report forwarded by Sir II. Rumbold on February 14th &quot;(received 20th), &quot;all Berlin knows&quot; that Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg &quot; were the victims of a coldly-premeditated assassination.&quot; The same report stated that hatred of the enemy and the idea of revenge were being preached, except in Bavaria, where Kurt EisneFs influence was still considerable. Sir II. Rumbold on February 21st reported the assassination of Kurt Eisner on the previous day. [See cdso under &quot; General,&quot; on page 2 (Third-Party Crimes, and Bolshevism), and Appendix.]Bavaria. Sir II. Rumbold on February 24th reported that Dr. Muehlon had been invited by the Council of Workmen and Soldiers to be Foreign Minister, and that his acceptance was dependent xipon a promise of support by the Allied Govern-ments. He lias gone to Munich. Given the support asked for he expects to &quot;wield considerable power over the Weimar Government. [Dr. Muehlon&apos;s record is well known from his disclosures about the origin of the Avar and responsibility of the German industrialist magnates and militarists.] German Wireless of the 24th announced that, &quot; according to the newspapers, the German State GoATernment has decided not to recognise the Council regime proclaimed in Munich, since it is a contradiction to the principles of democracy.&quot;Arrest of Radek. The arrest of Radek, the Bolshevik agent, was reported by Sir H. Rumbold on February 20th, Sir W. Townley on the 21st, and Lord Kilmarnock on the 24th.   Reports agree that he was in the Moabit prison.League of Nations. On February I8th-19th (received 24th) Sir W. Townley gave extracts from the German Press, referring chiefly to the exclusion of Germany, at which chagrin is expressed.   German Wireless takes much the same line.Occupied Territory. Lord Derby on February 21st reported the views of the Left Bank of the Rhine Commission on difficult financial problems arising and interfering Avith orderly administration. The matter is before the Supreme Economic Council.Factories in Occupied Territory. The question of visits by Allied representatives is being considered (Foreign Office to Lord Derby, February 25th, and Lord Derby, February 2Gth).Hanover. The Secretary of State for War has circulated a Memorandum (G.T. 685S) on the economic and food situation in Hanover by Captains E. Christie-Miller and E. B. Tratford. The general impression conveyed by the report&apos; is that industries are languishing for Avant of raw material, and that there is a real shortage of foodstuffs for. the civil population, considerably accentuated by army requirements.Brunswick. According to German Wireless of February 20th the conflict-between the two Social Democratic Parties in Brunswick has been settled by the formation of a purely Socialistic Government on a basis of equality. The Soldiers&apos; Councils will, be cancelled from April 1st, but the Workmen&apos;s Councils will remain in existence, Avith the right of veto against the decisions of the Diet. As the Diet consists of 31. Social Democrats of both Parties and 29 Citizen members, the Citizen Party have already announced that they cannot consent to their complete omission.
Danzig. Enquiries have been made about the fate of the thousands of Russian prisoners repatriated by the Danzig route from Holland (E.O. to Sir E. Howard, February 22nd), and Mr. Robertson (February 22nd) told that it is not desirable for this route to be used for the purpose. The repatriation via Danzig of the Polish army now in France is being arranged (Astoria?February 25th).Krupp&apos;8 new Mine in Sweden. The War Office Summary for February 21th reported ore mining by Krupp at Pitea, a coast town not far from the northern extremity of the Gulf of Bothnia.NEUTRAL GROUP-BALTIC PROVINCES.General. The Admiralty represent the desirability of giving certain assistance to help the Baltic States to defend&quot; themselves against the Bolsheviks, and suggest the limitation of German forces and their gradual reduction (F.O. to Astoria, February 2-lth). A letter from a Pole in Lithuania (published, in The Times of February 2-lth) about the conduct of German soldiers in that area is of interest in this connection. After describing that conduct, the writer acids : &quot; Everybody is wishing that those (the Bolsheviks) would come against whom . the Germans profess to protect us.&quot;   (See also under &quot; Courland.&quot;)On February 22nd, Lord Kilmarnock reported that all. the Baltic States, and Lithuania, would prefer Allied to German help, the Germans were assisting the Lithuanians financially. A danger of the re-establishment of German influence was foreshadowed. The French Government favours the assistance of the Baltic Provinces against the Bolsheviks (Lord Derby, February 21st).Esihonia. Lord Kilmarnock, on February 24th, forwarded a report on the serious food shortage at Reval, and a desire for a supply of fish from Norway. On the same date, a request for Esthonian prisoners in Germany to be collected and repatriated. On February 22nd a report that Germany was offering arms to the Esthonians, who would only accept them with the Allies&apos; consent, and wotdd prefer our assistance.Livonia. The co-operation of Letts with Esthonians and Lithuanians has been reported, and the question of financial help for the Lettish Government has been raised (Mr. Clive, February .19th). On February 1 Sth Mr. Clive exjdaiued the measures being taken by the Latvian Prime Minister to establish combined resistance to the Bolsheviks by Finland, Esthonia, Livonia, Courland and Lithuania, and added his opinion that financial help for Livonia would be a most effective aid in combating the Bolsheviks.Courland. Lord Kilmarnock on February 22nd reported that the German troops being sent to. Libau were reliable. In the report from Mr. Clive of February 18th referred to under &quot; Livonia,&quot; the question was raised of offering the timber of the Libau district forests as security for a loan to combat Bolshevism. An urgent request for a British Fleet to be sent to Libau was received through Lord Kilmarnock on February 25th. Some German landowners seem to have been included in the Lettish Government, and German influence strengthened bv the arrival of German troops (ibid).[Lithuania does not come within the province of the Western Report, but it is of interest, in connection, with the above, to note (Astoria, February 22nd) that an anti-Bolshevik Lithuanian delegation is trying to get to London to give information .and. obtain assistance in equipment and arms.]DENMARK.Telegram Censorship. According to Press announcements, Danish telegram censorship was to be abolished on February 24th (Lord Kilmarnock, 23rd).Smuggling in German Money. Lord Kilmarnock reported on February 25th, on information from a reliable source, that German securities and money were being sin uggled in on a large scale.
sState Loan. There has been much opposition in the Riksdag on this question, and the position of the Government is threatened (ibid).FINLAND.Combating Bolshevism. Mr. Clive (Stockholm) on February 18th put the supply of food to Finland in the forefront as a measure leading to effective action against the Bolsheviks.General Mannerheim. The General and Foreign Minister left Stockholm on February 20th, the projected visit to Norway having been given up because of the attitude of Socialists in Norway and reported danger of assassination (Mr. Clive).Relations ivith. Russia. M. Sazonoff is credited with a verbal statement to a Finnish delegate in Paris that Russia would want to keep military forces in Finland, that he opposed the cession to Sweden of the Aland Islands, and thought that it was a necessity for Russia to be strong in the Gulfs of Bothnia and of Finland (Mr. Clive, February 20th).London and Paris. Finnish representatives have been appointed (Lord Derby, February 22nd).MEXICO.Attitude of Carranza. Carranza is adopting a difficult attitude in relationship with Great Britain (Mr. Cummins, February 19th).Bolshevism. Centres for the dissemination of Bolshevism are being started in several important towns, and some anxiety has been caused about the probable results (Mr. Cummins, February 19th).Campaign against Pelaez. A new campaign is being started against Pelaez by the Government (Mr. Cummins, February 24-th). Villa is said to be becoming more active and stronger (in the North V) (ibid).(See also under &apos;: United States of America.&quot;)NETHERLANDS.Passage of Allied Troops through Holland. A question has arisen about the passage of Allied troops into the occupied territory in Germany across Holland. In the opinion of the military authorities such passage is essential and urgent, and the Associated Governments are united on the subject (Sir W. Townley, February 19th, and Astoria, February 22nd). The movement of British demobilised men and men on leave from Cologne via Rotterdam appears to be indirectly affected (Sir W. Townley and Lord Derby, February 24th). According to latest information the Government is likely to accede to the wishes of the British Government as affecting traffic both ways (Sir W. Townley, February 25th).Escape of German Deslrrnjers from Zeebrugge. According to reliable information received from the Admiralty (No. 370, February 21st-24th) the German destroyers from Zeebrugge escaped through Dutch territorial waters last October.Belgian Claims. On February 19th (received 24th) Sir \V. Townley forwarded, a copy of the Foreign MinisteFs statement on February .18th. &apos; The following extract is important: &quot; A communique from the Belgian Ministry for Foreign Affairs has been published on the 17th instant, from which it appears that the Belgian Government has, by means of a statement, submitted to the Conference at Paris of the repre-sentatives of the five great Allied and Associated Powers, problems in which Netherland interests are directly involved.&quot; In the opinion of the Government that official notification imposes upon it the duty of asking the Belgian Government for further information regarding the communications made by it at Pails. In connection herewith the Legation at Brussels has been instructed to approach the Belgian Government for that purpose.
&quot; The Netlierland representatives in the.cap.itals of the live great Powers concerned have at the same time been invited to bring my statement of the 14-th instant officially to the notice of the Governments of these Powers.&quot;The Dutch Minister in London communicated the substance of this statement verbally to the Foreign Secretary-on February 19th, adding that in all matters the Dutch would be glad to come to an amicable arrangement with the Belgians, but would never consent to the cession of an inch of territory (F.O. 2S582, February 19th).Typhus in Rotterdam. Up to February 20th there had been 300 cases (30 deaths). The disease was believed to have been brought from Germany by prisoners of war (Mr. Maxse, February 20th).Austrian Merchant Skips. Arrangements have been made for distribution of these vessels in Holland and the Dutch East Indies to the control of the French and British Governments (Sir W. Townley, February 24-th).NORWAY.Reorganisation of Government. Reorganisation of the Government has been completed by M. Knudsen (Sir M. Findlay, February 20th).Bolshevism. Sir M. Findlay has ascertained on reliable authority that a printing press for spreading Bolshevik propaganda in Great Britain, and amongst the Allied troops in Northern Russia, has been established at Stavanger.Spitsbergen. Much indignation has been aroused by Press rumours that Sweden had entered a protest in London against the claims of Norway to Spitsbergen. The Swedish Minister and the Swedish Government (more vaguely) have contradicted these rumours (Sir M. Findlay, February 22nd).SPAIN.Resignation of-Prime Minister. Count Romanones tendered his resignation on February 24th, but it was not accepted by the King (Sir A. Hardinge, February 25th).Retention of the six German Ships. This question is still being discussed. (Astoria, February 21st, Sir A. Hardinge, 21st, and Foreign Office to Lord Derby, 24-th). The Spanish Government agrees to the question of legal ownership being decided by the Peace Conference. It is proposed that the Spanish flag should be flown at the poop, and Inter-Allied flag at the masthead.Exchange Market. The delay in settlement of the above shipping question seems to bear upon the exchange question (report forwarded through Sir A. Hardinge, February 20th-22nd).Barcelona Situation. On February 11th (received 22nd) the general situation as regards strikes was reported to be most grave. The Government had decided to deport Russian revolutionaries without any more delay (Sir A. Hardinge). On February 22nd the Admiralty heard that the train service, electric light, and gas had been stopped at 4 p.m. on the previous evening. On the same date Sir A. Hardinge confirmed the report, the Syndicalists having ordered out the workmen. The position of the Government was likely to be affected by a revolutionary strike. Military measures were being taken. On February 24th Mr. Smith (Barcelona) reported an improvement in the situation by military assistance, and the partial lighting, of the town and the running of tramways, &amp;c. Several leaders had been arrested, and strikers who came out against their will were expected to go back to work (con-firmed by previous reports from Sir A. Hardinge and Mr. Smith, February 22nd). The workmen seem to have struck from terror, not from any definite grievances, and. they had put forward no demands up to the 22nd. On February 25th Sir A. Hardinge reported a further great improvement in the Barcelona situation.7378-46 C

APPENDIXWestern and General Report No. 108.Policy prescribed in the German War Book as affecting &quot;Third Party Crimes.&quot;&quot;Bribery of the enemy&apos;s subjects with the object of obtaining military advantages, acceptance of offers of treachery, reception of deserters, utilisation of the discontented elements in the population, support of pretenders and the like, are permissible; indeed, international law is in no way opposed4 to the exploitation of the crimes of third parties (assassination, incendiarism, robbery, and the like) to the prejudice of the enemy.&quot; Considerations of chivalry, generosity, and honour may denounce in such cases a hasty and unsparing exploitation of such advantages as indecent and dishonourable, but law which is less touchy allows it. &apos; The ugly and inherently immoral aspect of such methods cannot affect the recognition of their lawfulness. The necessary aim of war gives the belligerent the right and imposes upon him, according to circumstances, the duty not to let slip the important, it may be the decisive, advantages to be gained by such means.&apos; &quot;!X&quot;.B. (1) Note 4 on the above bij Professor J. II- Morgan, Editor of the English edition, rnns as follows:  &apos;: This represents the German War Book in its most disagreeable light, and is casuistry of the worst kind. There are certain things on which international law is silent because it will not admit the possibility of their existence. As Professor Holland well puts it (The Laws of War on Land, page 61). in reference to the subject of reprisals. The Hague Conference &apos; declined to seem to add to the authority of a practice so repulsive &apos; by legislating on the subject. And so with assassination. It can never be presumed from The Hague or other international agreements that what is not expressly forbidden is thereby approved.&quot;!NYB. (2) The quotation given in the last paragraph of the extract from the German War Book is from Professor Luder&apos;s Hundhuch des Viilkerrechts, page 90. In support of the statement about the law being &quot;less touchy&quot; the War Book gives in a footnote a. reference to Professor Bluntschli&apos;s Vvlherrccht, page 816.
