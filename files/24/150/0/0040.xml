The Baltic States, Silesia, and Hungary are the chief centres of interest amongst countries dealt with in this week&apos;s Western Report.The return of General von der Goltz to Mitau has been reported officially from Riga. The complicity of the German Government in the action of German military authorities in the Baltic States is not established.The situation in Silesia is somewhat critical, the Germans being accused of atrocities and the Poles of revolutionary movements.Reports of the procedure of the Rumanians in Hungary are conflicting.Baltic States. While there is still nothing to show that these States are not in a position to stem an invasion from Bolshevik Russia, combined offensive action against the Bolsheviks seems now to be out of the quest-ion..Belgium  There has been a hitch in the negotiations with Holland, and considerable friction has resulted.Finland. Press reports of the attitude of the &quot; North-West Russian Government &quot; towards Finland are of interest.Germany. A part from the political side of recent events in Silesia, reports of the influence on the coal output are of special importance during the present European shortage.Hungary. Accusations, denied by the Rumanians, of stopping food supplies destined for Budapest have now been supported by Admiral Troubridge.Japan. There are indications of a divergence of Japanese policy from that of the Allied and Associated Powers, as affecting China.Mexico. -Mr. Cummins does not expect further molestation by the Carranza Government,United States of America.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.general.NOTE. In accordance with a decision of the War Cabinet (August 19th, Minutes 617. 5) the &quot; Western and General,&quot; &quot; Eastern,&quot; and the foreign portion of the &quot; British Empire and Africa&quot; weekly Reports will be combined after the 1st of October in a &quot; Foreign Countries&quot; Report, issued fortnightly.AUSTRIA.Coal Shortage. Vienna Wireless reported on August 19th : &quot; The coal situation in Vienna has reached a crisis. The suspension of express trains (Schnellzuege) is soon to be followed by that of several parliamentary trains (Personenzuege). The supplies of the Vienna electricity and gas-works can last for four or five days at the most and a suspension is inevitable. In the last few clays even food trains have been held up in places.&quot;Situation in Garinthia. German Wireless of August 25th contained violent accusations against the Yugo-Slavs in Carinthia, as affecting a plebiscite.THE BALTIC STATES.The Baltic States, Germany, and Russia. A Foreign Office despatch dated August 21st [118716], summed up the situation as follows : &quot; The hopes that were at one time so widely entertained of an advance upon Petrograd by the combined forces of Esthonians, Pinns, and the Russian armies still operating in the neighbour-hcod have had to be abandoned. Furthermore, the Germans exhibit a calculated reluctance to withdraw from these parts of the Baltic States which they were rashly permitted to occupy with their forces ; and the general situation on this front cannot be described as otherwise than cliscpueting.&quot; On August 22nd The Times&apos; Berlin correspondent reported that the German army in the Baltic States was now flouting the German Government. General von der Goltz&apos;s return to Mitau was reported from Riga by Mr. Cazalet on August 25th. Co-operation between Germans and Russians was indicated.Sir Hubert Gough&apos;s Mission. A General Staff memorandum dated August 20th (G.T. 8035), described the progress made in Finland and the Baltic States : &quot; The efforts made by General Gough, in the face of great difficulties and opposition, to ensure the execution of the demands made to the Germans by Marshal Fooh have met with a considerable measure of success. General Gough&apos;s actions have resulted in removing German influence to a large extent in these States, and it would appear that General Gough, in so far as he has been able hitherto, has carried out the task with which he has been entrusted in a most satisfactory and praiseworthy manner in the interests both of the Baltic States and of the Allies.&quot; Appended to the memorandum is a copy of the instructions issued by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to General Gough on June 1th, 1919.Treaty between Latvia and Esthonia. Esthonian wireless (Reval) on August 17th gave the substance of a Treaty signed between the Lettish and Esthonian Republics. The message was jammed in places ; it referred chiefly to the withdrawal of the German Divisions, and to the policy of disbanding the Baltic Landwehr of German race, and of the disposal geographically of Baltic-German troops.The Treaty concluded as follows : &quot; Point 11. Citizens of the Esthonian Republic who live and reside in the territory of the Lettish Reprdolic will be exempted from mobilisation in the forces of Latvia. The aforesaid persons may, without hindrance, leave the territory of the Lettish Republic.
&quot; Point 12. In order to consider questions concerning how to organise communi-cations between points in Latvia territory to the north of the line indicated in paragraph 6 and the rest of Latvia, also through traffic in the area to the north of this line, there will be founded in the near future (?) a mixed commission of representatives of the Governments of both Republics.&quot; Point 13. For the consideration and clearing up of the question of the firm fixing of the final State boundaries of the Esthonian and Lettish Republics, there will be founded a mixed commission, five members from each Government.&quot; Point 11. The Commissions designated in this Treaty will hold their sittings at Valk.&quot; Signed at Riga on July 21st, 1919, by the Prime Minister of Latvia, Ulman, signatures of Toenisson and Rink, Plenipotentiaries of the Government of the Esthonian Republic, Foreign Minister.&quot;Stoppage of American Food Supplies. The Deputy Commissioner at Reval, on August 20th, reported the effect of the &quot; abrupt termination of all American food supplies.&quot;Esthonia. A Foreign Office circular telegram of August 22nd reported the recognition of complete independence by the North-Western Russian Government.&quot; The question of recognition by the British Government has not been decided.Latvia. The following appeared in German Wireless of August 21th : :&apos; The Lettish Information Bureau at Copenhagen reported that a new German conspiracy against Latvia, in which troops of the army of Von der Goltz were implicated, had been discovered and frustrated. It is alleged that unrest was to be caused in order to give the troops of Von der Goltz a pretext for entering Libau to restore order. The troops were alleged to have been in communication Avith the official German representative in Libau, Dr. Ivueck.&apos;&apos; The report of the Lettish Information Bureau is entirely untrue. The facts of the case are that at the beginning of the month riots Avere planned by former German troops of the notorious Lettish Division &apos; Goldfeld&apos; (sic). The. troops intended to arrest one of the chief officials in LoAA*er Courland and to plunder people of property in Libau. No German troops or officials Avere in any Avay concerned in the affair. A protest Avas made to the Lettish Government against the circulation of the neAvs that Commissary Ivueck was in any Avay concerned in the conspiracy.&quot;As against the above, Mr. Cazalet reported from Riga on August 25th that the Germans had disarmed the Lettish garrison of Mitau, entered their headquarters, and blown open and plundered their safe, containing money (see cdso under Baltic States, Germany, and Russia, above).Bolshevik Offensive. The capture of Pskoff Avas reported in the Press on August 28th.BELGIUM.Negotiations with Netherlands. The progress of the negotiations in Paris Avas reported on August 23rd (Astoria). The attitude of the Press in both countries might embitter relations. The best means of satisfying Belgium in defence questions was being considered [see cdso under Netherlands]. Sir F. Villiers on August 21st reported the substance of an interview with the Belgian Foreign Minister in which complaints were made about the attitude of the Dutch Delegates during the discussions in Paris.Debate on Peace Treaty. In a despatch dated August 12th (received 14th) Sir F. Villiers reported the discussion in the Belgian Chamber on the Peace Treaty with Germany and the passage of the Liav approving the Treaty by a unanimous vote. A declaration by a Socialist that not one of his party deemed the Treaty too hard upon the Germans Avas loudly cheered.CHINA.Tibet Frontier Question. On August 19th Sir J. Jordan forwarded information indicating possible trouble on the China-Tibet boundary and suggested that the Tibetans should be warned. On the fdlloAving clay he reported negotiations with the Chinese Foreign Minister on the subject, and on August 21st a request to India to prevail upon the Government of Tibet to abstain from hostilities.
American Minister. The resignation of the American Minister having been accepted, he is expected to leave in. about three weeks (Sir J. Jordan, August 19th).British Interests in China. The Tientsin and Chefoo British Chambers of Commerce have made representations about the expected damage to British interests by the situation arising over the &quot; Shantung&quot; cpiestion (Mr. King, Chefoo, August 20th).Siberian Policy as affecting China. On August 21st Sir J. Jordan repotted a desire on the part of the Chinese Minister to be informed of the policy decided upon by His Majesty&apos;s Government as affecting the situation in Siberia.COSTA RICA.Resignation of the President. President Tinoco&apos;s resignation was accepted by Congress on August 20th (Mr. Bennett, Panama, August 25th).CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.President Masarylts Policy. In a despatch dated August 10th, Sir C. Gosling-reported the substance of an interview with President Masaryk, who regarded any prospect of a Hapsburg being on the throne of Hungary as a distinct menace to Czecho-Slovakia, as a strong Magyar army would, no doubt, form part of his political programme.   M. Masaryk was clearly apprehensive of events in Hungary.In Slovakia and Ruthenia the Jews, numbering 250,000, will be removed from all employment in which they can harm the Republic, and this policy will be applied to schools.   Magyar propaganda continues in Slovakia.M. Masaryk also expressed his opinion of events in German-Austria, Poland, and Russia.   He was apprehensive of the re-establishment of monarchies in those countries.DENMARK.North Slesvig. German Wireless of August 19th gave the following account of the work of the Entente Commission in North Slesvig : &quot; The Entente Commission for carrying out the plebiscite in North Schleswig has been constituted in Copenhagen and has now commenced its functions. It consists of one.representative of North Schleswig and one for England, America, France, Sweden, and Norway respectively. For the work of evacuating the district affected by the plebiscite North Schleswig will be represented by Coimcillor Boehm of Tondern, who has gained the impression that the Banish Government are ready to respect the interests of North Schleswig. This view is also shared by the Prime Minister Zahle and by Hansen, the former German-Danish Deputy, who is now Minister for North Schleswig-. It is rumoured that the plebiscite district will be occupied by a French battalion.&quot;Slesvig War Prisoners.  Such prisoners in Japan were to leave on August 28th to record their votes (Mr. Alston, August 25th).FINLAND.British Representative. On August 2nd Mr. Bell forwarded a message from the President welcoming a proposal that Lord Acton should be British Minister in Finland, and adding that the appointment would be looked upon as an honour to the Republic of Finland.Condolences in British losses. On August 20th the Foreign Minister called upon Mr. Bell and asked him to convey to His Majesty&apos;s Government the condolences of the Finnish Government in British Naval losses in the Cronstadt attack.Recognition by the Russian North-West Government. According to Press reports, recognition of the independence of Finland by the Russian North-West Government will depend upon FinlancVs co-operation in the struggle against the Russian Soviet Government (Mr. Ramsay, August 25th).
FRANCE.Policy in South Jhissia. A telegram from Sir G. Grahame, dated August 22nd, gave the substance of a statement by the Foreign Minister ou French policy in South Russia.GERMANY.Emigration. Steps taken in Germany to facilitate emigration were reported in The time a of August 18th : &quot;The German Government regards Japan, Brazil, and, above all, the Argentine, as the countries particularly adapted to afford a home for German emigrants. A German Commission, consisting of representatives of the Pceichswandaramt, will shortly proceed to the Argentine, primarily for the purpose of safeguarding the persons arriving from being, as so often happened before the &quot;war. in all foreign ports, robbed and taken in by foreign Germans and people of the countries themselves.&quot;[Sec also under &quot; Argentine &quot; in Western Report No. 132.]11 Militarism.&quot; A report based on reliable authority- comes from Switzerland to the effect that during the Lucerne Socialist Conference one of the German Independent Socialists (Cristien) claimed to have proofs that the German Govern-ment was already adopting plans to defeat the armament limitations impjosed by the Peace Treaty, and making preparations to be in a position to mobilise over a million trained men. No reference was made to tbe incident in detailed Press reports of the Conference Proceedings (Sir If. Rumbold, August 20th).Situation in Silesia. The following German Wireless accounts of the situation in Silesia are of sufficient importance to reproduce: August 20th. The communication from Paris that the Entente have planned the occupation of Upper Silesia has given rise to lively discussions in the German Press. The suspicion is expressed that certain Entente circles would like to avail themselves of the disturbances in Upper Silesia as a pretext for exploiting this valuable economic district. As to Germany&apos;s ability to establish and maintain order in Upper Silesia with her own resources no doubt can possibly exist. In consequence of the recent events in Upper Silesia, a conference between the Poles and Germans was to have taken place in Berlin on the morning of August 20th, at the suggestion and with the participation of the French Military Mission. At the opening of the Conference the Poles suddenly- declared, however, that in view of the situation in Upper Silesia having become more acute, they could not enter upon negotiations. Both the German President and General Dupont expressed their astonishment and the negotiations were thereupon postponed. At the request, however, of three members of the Polish delegation, it was decided to resume the negotiations in the afternoon of the same day. August 21st. The conference between Germany and Poland on the question of Upper Silesia was continued on August 21st. German)- maintains the standpoint that the Polish delegation has no claim whatever to deliver a judgment&apos;on the events in Upper Silesia. Upper Silesia is still a German district, and so long as the Peace Treaty is not ratified, the German authorities are alone entitled to re-establish peace and order. Even the French General Dupont has declared in the name of the Entente Corn-mission that he shares the German view that, until the ratification of the Peace Treaty, Poland has nothing to say with regard to Upper Silesia. August 23rd. The German State Commissioner Hoersing, to whom in the first place credit is due for the re-establishment of order in Upper Silesia, has expressed himself as follows to Press-representatives : &quot;The latest reports from Upper Silesia are still favourable. Order is being gradually restored. Isolated insurgent nests are being cleaned up. The workmen are olice again beginning to listen to reason. They have lost their fear of a Spartacist terror, and are now returning to work. If no unforeseen incident arises, the end of this week will see a complete resumption of work.&quot; As regards the cause of the outbreak, Hoersing declared that, in his opinion, the movement was due to the Spartacists, and only assumed the character of a national political movement when certain Polish elements intervened in Upper Silesia. This is proved by numerous discoveries of documents concerning a secret Polish military organisation in Upper Silesia, by the seizure of arms and munitions of Polish origin, and, not least, by the fact that prisoners have been taken belonging to HalleFs army. In conclusion, the State Commissioner declared that the intensified state of siege- would be at once removed as soon as cptiet and order had been completely re-established, and work entirely resumed. August 25th. -The development of the situation in Upper Silesia tends towards the re-establishment of ordered conditions, &amp;c.   [TheS709-4b u
Polish side of the question was fully set forth in The Times of August 25th-26th, together with serious accusations of German atrocities. On August 26th a telegram dated the 20th was received from Sir P. Wyndham (Warsaw) describing the fighting between Poles and Germans.]OoaZ Supply. The Deutsche Allgemcine Zeitunrj has published a long article proving Germany&apos;s incapacity to deliver the full amount of coal demanded by the Peace Treaty. Even should the annual delivery of 40,000,000 tons be reduced to 20,000,000, Germany would still be brought to the verge of ruin. Should the Entente insist on their demands, the result would be the closing down of the furnaces and the general cessation of production in Germany (G.W., August 22nd). [Compare Mr. Hoover&apos;s estimate in Appendix to Western Report, No. 132.]Germany and the Baltic States. According to an official communication published by wireless, the German Government has taken measures to prevent the transport of men and war material to Latvia and has prohibited recruiting. The Lithuanian district to the south of the Niemen is also to be completely evacuated in the course of the next two weeks (G.W., August 20th). [Compare reports under Baltic States, above.]The Nauen wireless station on August 22nd reverted to war methods of anti-British, propaganda, especially as affecting British intentions in Esthonia. [The method referred to is to inspire a false statement in some paper in a small nexitral country and then to give world-wide publicity to the statement by long-range wireless.]Bavaria. According to German Wireless of August 20th : &quot; The invitation of the Paris Temps to Bavaria to take part in the formation of a great Catholic State, comprising German-Austria, Hungary and Bavaria, has entirety missed its mark. Not only has tho joroposal been officially rejected by the Bavarian Government, but the idea has been denounced by the whole of the Bavarian parties as an attempt on the part of French politicians to bring about the cleavage of Germany, which they failed to effect at the Peace Conference. The article of Llanotaux in the Revue des&apos; Deux Morales proves (?) that France&apos;s real war aim was the destruction of Germany&apos;s national unity. In view of the loyal attitude of the governments and inhabitants of the associated German States, these plans have no prospect of support within Germany.&quot;Revolutionary Movements. German Wireless of August 23rd-24-th reported the attitude of the Majority Socialists in opposing a Soviet Dictatorship, and the suppression of the &quot;Red (Communist) Executive Council &quot; by the Government.HONDURAS.Position of tlie Government. According to reports from Tegucigalpa and Puerto Cortes, forwarded by Air. Armstrong (Guatemala) on August 25th the Government has now gained control, and has offered to grant an amnesty to political refugees.HUNGARY.Rumanian Armistice. The question of the armistice terms imposed upon the Flungarians by Rumania is the subject of a telegram from Mr. Rattigan, dated August 13th (received 21st). He had entered a protest against the harshness of the terms.Wireless Reports of the Situation.- The following have been intercepted :  Hungarian. Wireless, Budapest.. A. proclamation issued by the Rumanian Chief Military and Civil Authorities in Hungary states that the proclamation published by the Hungarian Government, ordering a state of siege in Hungary, is null and void, as only the Commander of the Rumanian troops has the right to issue such proclamations, so long as the occupation of Hungary by the Rumanian Army continues (August 21st). The Rumanian Military High Command in Hungary have issued a proclama-tion, in which it is stated that all their efforts1 to bring food to Budapest have had no result, owing to the total lack of organisation on the part of the Hungarian authorities. The Rumanian Command are doing all in their power to compel the authorities to do their duty and to assist the population. They have organised food trains and have granted freedom of navigation on the Danube1 to all craft.   They allow the shops to1 Compare Admiral Troubridge&apos;s report, given below.
be open till 9 pan., and ouce more declare that the political life and the Press o f Budapest are completely free.   They exercise no censorship in. questions of internal politics, and at the same time refuse to assist anyone in political persecutions of any kind.   The Rumanian Command will only concern themselves with the maintenance of order (August 22nd).M. Diamandi, the Chief Commissary of the Rumanian Government at Budapest, is said to have stated in an interview that the present situation in Budapest was unstable, which was not surprising, when a Conservative regime succeeded a Bolshevist regime.. A Democratic Government was necessary, representing all parties except the promoters of anarchy. Rumania had been accused of assisting the Archduke to seize the power. The real facts were much simpler. The first Rumanian troops to enter Budapest had immediately proceeded to disarm all armed formations in that town, including the 2^olice of the first Government formed after the fall of Run, so that the Archduke and his followers had no difficulty in seizing power by a coup oVelat (August 23rd).Austrian Wireless, Vienna. A message from Vienna to Budapest of August 21st states that the resignation of the Archduke Joseph has been definitely decided on, because the Entente will only recognise a Government which represents all social classes. The Socialist leader Garami declared that his Party was ready to enter the Cabinet on condition that the Archduke resigned and that a Cabinet was formed of representatives of the bourgeois, peasants and workmen. This Cabinet would prepare for the elections to the Constituent Assembly, Avhich would in turn decide on the form of the State. Garami believes it possible that the Constituent Assembly will proclaim a Monarchy. This will not please the Socialists, but they will submit to the majority. The conflict between Austria and Hungary for the possession of the Western County (? West Hungary) has not yet been settled. The Austrian Government have sent a verbal note to Budapest stating that the occupation, bv Hungarian troops, of the provinces ceded to Austria by the Peace Conference is considered as an act of aggression. According to Vienna newspapers, Parisian journals demand that Rumanian troops should occupy these provinces in order to guarantee the genuineness of the plebiscite asked for by the Austrians. The following message was issued on August 23rd : Vazaryi, the former Hungarian Minister for Justice, who has arrived in Vienna, states that in view of the obstinate refusal of the Hungarian Prime Minister to resign, fresh negotiations with the Entente representatives are necessary.German Wireless, Nauen.- According to the German-Austrian Bauern Korrcspondenz, the Executive Committee of the Soldiers&apos; Council has decided that measures must be taken to prevent the popular will of the people of AVest Hungary being influenced. Negotiations on this subject have begun with Deutsch, the German-Austrian Secretary for War. According to the Rumanian Press Bureau at Budapest, the Prime Minister, Friedrich, has requested the Commander of the Rumanian garrison to occupy AVest Hungary with Rumanian troops. In Hungarian Government circles the opinion is held that the occupation of AVest Hungary by German-Austria would be resisted by force of arms (August 19th). Private reports of the Berlin newspapers describe the position of the Archduke Josephs Government in pessimistic terms, since a persecution of the JeAvs has broken out in Budapest and other parts of the country. An anti-Semitic attitude is said to preArail in the entire sphere of control of the new Government. The banks haAre refused to grant credit to the new Government (August 20th). In Steinamanger, Colonel Lehar, brother of the famous operetta composer, has for a long time been organising bands of officers in order to frustrate the desire of the Germans in AVest Hungary to unite with Austria. Numerous arrests have been made among the German peasants and Avorkers, Avho have been carried off to Steinamanger by the brutal soldiery. From Fuerstenfeld, whither numberless refugees have flocked, come urgent calls for the Styrians to occupy the country (August 20th). The report from Vienna that the Archduke Joseph is ready to resign his position as ruler of Hungary owing to his non-recognition by the Entente has been received with satisfaction by the German Republicans. It is stated that the Archduke&apos;s resignation was not altogether voluntary, and it is hoped that the Hapsburg episode in Hungary has now been terminated (August 22nd). According to reports from Vienna, pressure was exerted on the Archduke Joseph by members of his Cabinet to delay his retire-ment until after the elections. By influencing the electors in a monarchical sense, the Government hoped to obtain from the Hungarian Constituent Assembly a decision -favourable to the retention of the Archduke at the head of affairs in Hungary.   TheS70y-ih c
sHungarian Social Democrats protest against this procedure. The appearance on the political scene of. Count Julius Andrassy has aroused the mistrust of the Hungarian Republicans (August 23rd).Admiral Troulridge&apos;s Report. On August 18th Admiral Troubridge accused the Rumanians of deliberately stopping the transport of food to Budapest, and of obstructing his efforts to move food there by water (F.O. to Air. Rattigan, August 26th).ITALY.Friction between Italians and French. Action by the French Admiral in seizing an oil-ship, formerly belonging to Austria, but allotted to the Italians, has caused further friction (Sir R. Rodd, August 22nd).Visit of the Shah of Persia to Italy. Arrangements for the visit of the Shah formed the subject of telegrams between Sir R. Rodd and the Foreign Office on August 23rd.JAPAN.Japanese Policy in Mongolia and Manchuria. Mr. Alston on August 17th (received 26th) gave the substance of Japanese Press reports of a discussion in the Diplomatic Advisory Council on August 13th. bearing especially upon Japanese political and economic policy in Mongolia and Manchuria. The War Minister was credited with strong opposition to a sacrifice by Japau of her &quot;rights&quot; in these territories, and with &quot; dwelling on the unfair attitude of America and Great Britain in demanding an open door and equal opportunity in China, while excluding the Japanese from their own countries.&quot; On August 22nd Mr. Alston followed up this report with an important telegram (received August 25th) reviewing the whole question of Japanese policy as affecting the exclusion from the proposed loan consortium of Mongolia and Manchuria. The Japanese policy in these matters seems likely to lead to the isolation of Japan, which the Government is apparently prepared to face.MEXICO.Position of Mr. Cummins. A cipher telegram was received from Mr. Cummins immediately after the issue of last week&apos;s Report (6.45 p.m., August 21st), and from subsequent telegrams received from him up to the 24th it seems improbable that Carranza&apos;s Government will take any further steps to send him out of the country, or take away his postal or cipher privileges. In such circumstances the question of entrusting British interests to any other Power does not at present arise.Enquiry into International Difficulties. The Senate has decided to institute an enquiry (Mr. Cummins, August 22nd).Friction with United States.  United States troops ^crossed the frontier about August 20th to deal with bandits (Mr. Cummins and Mr. Lindsay, August 20th). In the opinion of Mr. Cummins a very large majority (80 per cent.) of the Mexican population would be glad if the United States did intervene and ensure security in Mexico.   [See also under &quot; United States.&quot;]NETHERLANDS.Friction with Belgium. On August 21st Mr. Robertson forwarded information about Press and other reports on causes of friction with Belgium over the negotiations in Paris. There is a general opinion in Holland that the Paris negotiations are not likely to be successful as long as M. Hymans is Belgian Foreign Minister. On the 24th Sir F. Villiers forwarded from Brussels a report on the falsification of the date of a document published at the Hague, so as to make it appear to be subsequent to the 4th of June, the date of a decision by the Peace Conference.[See also under &quot;Belgium.&quot;]NORWAY.Future of Spitzbergen. The question of the future of Spitzbergen has been raised by the Norwegian Minister in London (Foreign Office to Mr. Ovey, August ISth).   The Swedish Government is credited with the view that Norway
should be given a mandate, instead of sovereignty over Spitzbergen, on tbe plea that the inhabitants were Norwegians, who owned and worked most of the coal deposits.Hungarian Securities. On August 22nd Mr. Ovey conveyed an enquiry from the Foreign Minister about the policy of the Allied and Associated Powers as affecting the control of Hungarian securities.SERBIA, AND SERB-CROAT-SLOVENE KINGDOM.Composition of New Ministry. The following message from Belgrade has-The Prince Regent haspublished in the Press (Reuter, August 16th) decree appointing the new Ministry [for the Serb-Croat-Slovene Cabinet which has been formed by the Social-Democratic Party,signedbeen thefollowskingdom].

Reports from Mr. Ramsay, dated August 20th-26th, state on the authority of Politiken, that dock labourers are refusing to load war material for the Omsk Government. On August 25th he quoted a statement emanating from the same source, that a simultaneous attack, with Moscow as the goal, was to be made at the end of the month by &quot; the armies of 14 countries &quot; and &quot;Germany is to join in with recruits and prisoners of Avar, America supplying material only, and Italy taking no part, and so on.&quot;The following appeared in German Wireless on August 25th : &quot; According to the Frankfurter Zeitung, the Swedish Press has begun propaganda for the resumption of commercial relations between Sweden and Soviet Russia. The Stockholm Trade Unions have adopted a resolution in this sense. - The Swedish business world is still more in favour of such a course. Recently Sweden submitted to American business men by means of her Trade Representative in New York a plan for the formation of a great American-Baltic Company. The object of this is the promotion of trade between America on the one hand, and Russia and the Baltic Provinces on the other. ScandinaAda would form the connecting link, to the exclusion of Germany.&quot;Visit of General Yudenich, Liasonoff, and Skoropadski.
