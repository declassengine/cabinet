WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.THE BALTIC STATES.Esthonian Manifesto. As a reply to the resolution passed by the Southport Conference condemning intervention in Russia, the Provisional Government of Esthonia has transmitted a message to the British Government stating that the Esthonian people are struggling to retain their independence and their right to self-determination, and to protect their frontier against aggression from without. The manifesto continues: &quot; With the moral and material help of the Entente Powers, and. especially of Great Britain, the Esthonian people have founded a democratic republic, the power resting in the hands of a Constituent Assembly based on the general, direct, and proportional votes of all citizens over 20 years of age, without sex discrimination. The executive is in the hands of the Republican Government, which is elected by the Constituent Assembly.&quot; The Esthonian people are filled with a deep sense of gratitude to Great Britain for the generous help accorded to them, and hope that English democracy will not refuse their support to such nations as are fighting for a just and democratic political system, and for the right of self-determination ; but in case all further support is stopped, Esthonia will inevitably become the victim of Imperialist Communism &quot; (Mr. Bosanquet, July 19th).Reaction. According to a report received from the Esthonian Staff, the Command of the Russian Northern Corps has established the old laws of the Czarist regime in the liberated districts. This action is resented hy the population (Foreign Office, July 16th).Bolshevik Activity. The Chief of the Esthonian Staff reports that 32 soldiers recently mutinied at Yuriev. Twenty of these were court-iuartialled and shot. The outbreak is ascribed to Bolshevik propaganda. Bolshevik agents, among whom a large number of women are to be found, are said to be working for a general strike after the withdrawal of the British squadron (Mr. Bosanquet, July 19th).The German Evacuation.  General Gough reports that (1) the Germans refuse to evactiate Lettlancl as long as German interests are not guaranteed; (2) that they refuse to recognise the actual Lettish Government; (3) that they intend to carry out their evacuation by road and rail and not by sea. The President of the German Armistice Commission has therefore been requested to represent to the German Government that no further deley should be incurred in evacuating Baltic territories. On July 20th General Gough held an interview with Von der Goltz. The latter asserted that he had no instructions to discuss the evacuation of Lettlancl. The impression was gained that the Germans were delaying their withdrawal in the hope that a pretext might arise for future intervention in Lettish affairs.^General Gough has ordered the transfer of Russian forces from Latavia to Narva (Colonel Tallents, July 20th).Unemployment. Mr. Grant Watson reports that there is a very large number of unemployed in Riga and Libaii. The chief cause of unemployment is lack of raw materials. Mr. Llmanis takes a very serious view of the consequent social unrest and fears that his Government may fall when the Volksrat reassembles unless some-thing is done to check unemployment. Mr. Ulmanis points out that a Government of Revolutionary Socialists would, probably break the compromise with the Baits and Avoidd. probably render any^ form of orderly government impossible.FINLAND.Finnish Advance on Petrograd. A note has been received from the Finnish Government requesting that an agreement may be concluded between Finland and the Entente Powers guaranteeing financial support and the supply of Avar materials
for any operations which may be taken, in conjunction with Admiral Kolchak, against Petrograd. Tho Finnish representative in London has been informed that General Judenich and General Mannerheim agreed to co-operate independently of the British Government. It is pointed out that, although the latter is in sympathy with Finnish aspirations and would like to see the advance proceed, no direct responsibility can be assumed. Admiral Kolchak is known to approve the scheme for a joint advance (Foreign Office, July 18th).FRANCE.Defeat of the Government. Sir G. Grahame reports that the Government was defeated in the Chamber on July 18th by 1-1 votes at the conclusion of the debate on the high cost of living. The Order of the Day, which was opposed hy the Cabinet and voted for by the Chamber, was as follows : &quot;The Chamber, noting that the cost of living in Belgium has diminished by half since last January, and in England by a fourth since the armistice, while in France it has not ceased, to increase since that date, judges the economic policy of Government by its results and passes to the order of the day.&quot;As a result of this vote the Minister of Supplies is understood to have tendered his resignation to the President of the Council.The July 21st Demonstration. On July loth Lord Derby reported that the Confederation Generale. du Travail had issued another appeal to the French labour classes in faArour of the 21 hours&apos; strike on July 21st.The appeal recapitulated the well-known objects of the strike which have been described in previous Reports, and ended : &quot; In accordance with the mandate given us by yon, we order you to stop work for 2-1 hours on July 2.1st.&quot;However, in spite of the activity of the extremists, the movement became increasingly unpopular among the working classes. It Avas generally realised that demobilisation and the revictualling,of large tOAA-ns would be ineAdtably delayed by the strike, which would thus defeat its own legitimate ends. Moreover, in view of the attitude of the British Trade Unions and the Italian railwaymen there was no prospect of an international strike. Therefore, in spite of the arnouncement of many important Trade Unions that they would support the strike, the Confederation General du Travail began tOAvaver, and on July 19th Sir G. Grahame reported that the strike had been abandoned for the ostensible reasons that the Government had been defeated, that its economic policy thereby stood condemned, and that the situation must now be considered from a new standpoint. It is also significant that preAdous to this decision the leaders of the Confederation held an interview with M. Clemenceau.The Homme Libre sums up the situation Avith some force : &quot; What will the demonstration demonstrate ? Nothing that everyone did not know before ; simply its own impotence to solve these economic problems, and its aptitude to aggravate a difficult situation. One can have a May-day every month, but it only lowers production and increases prices, and encourages new demands for higher wages, Avhich, again, leads to higher prices a hopelessly vicious circle. . . . The truth is, that the Avar has sharpened the appetite for pleasure from the top to the bottom of the social scale. . . . The Avorkmen and peasants haAre been Avar profiteers as Avell as the others ; no one wants to reduce his standard, neither the manufacturer, nor the tradesman, nor the agricultural producer, accustomed to large profits, nor the workman used to high wages.&quot;According to the Home Office RevieAv of Revolutionary Movements Abroad (G.T. 7725), there is evidence that there is a growing&quot; opposition to the extremists within the Confederation Generale du Travail. The more moderate section is suspicious of the militants, and detects in their AAdsh to bring about the fall of M. Clemenceau an attempt to promote the interests of Bolshevism and of Germany.British Imperialism. The Socialist, M. Marcel Cochin, Avrites in the Bumanite that the Treaty &quot; by its essential stipulations assures the complete hegemony of Anglo-Saxon capitalism. It eliminates the most redoubtable rival of British and American trade. By the unlimited power of their finances and their fleets, thanks to their possession of all raw materials, and their colossal colonial empire, the citizens of British tongue now dominate the entire uniA^erse. Thus is realised the traditional policy of the Foreign Office, Avhich has for centuries pursued its inflexible line &quot; (Lord Derby, June 29th).
The &quot; Temps&quot; on General Smuts. Commenting on General Smuts&apos; message, the Temps thinks that the General commits &quot; an error in psychology and an error in method &quot; ; that he is mistaken not only in the mentality of the Germans but in their needs ; if, after Germany has shown her gopd faith, the Allies wish to help her to raise herself, &quot; it is not the military occupation of the Rhine, nor the line of the German frontiers, nor the punishment of the guilty, nor the amount of the indemnity which must be reconsidered &quot; ; what Germany woidd need in the first instance would be &quot; to resume in as large a measure as possible her maritime traffic, her overseas trade, now paralysed by the loss of her colonies, of her -merchant marine, and of her markets. But, if we are not mistaken,&quot; concludes the writer, &quot; General Smuts says nothing of these things. Perhaps he feared to arouse certain susceptibilities ; hut then let us be careful of all susceptibilities together.&quot;GERMANY.Labour and Political Unrest. (1) Berlin. Work was resumed on the principal railway lines on July loth. A number of privately owned concerns, including tramways, remained idle.On July 21st a procession marched along the Unter den Linden carrying red flags.   The demonstrators refused to disperse aud were fired on by the military.(2) Westphalia. As a result of the prevalent unrest martial law has been proclaimed. The General Commanding at Minister has announced that all news-papers of a Spartacist, Communist or Bolshevist tendency will be seized wherever martial law exists.(3) Pomerania. A strike has broken out in Stettin as a protest against the continued imposition of military law.In other parts of Pomerania a strike movement among agricultural labourers is retarding work upon the land. A similar state of affairs prevails in East Prussia, where the military authorities are protecting those who are willing to work.[Idle above notes are taken from the German Wireless Reports. Julv 16 th to 21st,]&apos;Separatism. The motives of the Secessionist Party are very frankly stated by a writer in the Kolnische Zeitung (June 28th). He maintains that Germany&apos;s salvation from the present moral chaos is to come, if it is to come at all, from the Centrum, the Centrum being the sole representative of the Christian ideal of civilisation left in Germany.&apos; If the Catholic Rhineland separates from godless Prussia it may do effective work not, indeed, in the Prussian Diet, but in the National Assembly and in the Federal Council (Slaatenhaus) towards this ideal. If the Rhineiand remains an integral part of Prussia, the Rhenish Centrum remains as powerless as it has hitherto been against the anti-Catholic mass of the Diet, while in the Federal Council it would have no separate representation, but would be lumped together with Prussia. It is evident, moreover, the Avriter thinks, that the more the power of the Socialists wanes, the more they, and therefore the Government, will be dependent on the Centrum in both bodies, and the more will the Centrum be able to get out of them by discreet pressure. Not only the Rhineland, therefore, but the Centrum as a whole stands to gain more than it loses by the formation of the West German Republic.Herr Hirsch, speaking in the Prussian Assembly, made the following state ment: &quot; The Prussian Government still holds fast to the view that the separation of territory from Prussia is in any case dangerous for the unity of Germany and harmful for the strength and. effectiveness of Prussia and the whole Empire, and that such separation must be especially dangerous if planned in districts bordering on the occupation zone. The incidents in connection with the attempt made by Dorten to found a Rhine Republic prove, as does the attitude of General Mangin in the conversations with, the present Ministers, that nothing would be more in accordance with the wishes of the French than the weakening of Prussia by the detaching of territory from it and the formation of minor States, at Prussia&apos;s cost, which, even if for the present they remained formally as a part of the Empire, might awaken in the French the hope of their future amalgamation with the territory under French control.&quot;
oMemel. Mr. Grant Watson (Libau) lias been informed that there is no reason to fear serious opposition to the allied occupation of Memel. In spite of the pro-German Press campaign the German officials and business men are believed to have reconciled themselves to the coming change.   The garrison consists of one infantry battalion.The German Nobility. During the second reading of the Constitution Dill the German National Assembly rejected the proposal of the Independents to abolish nobility. The Assembly decided to abide by the decision of the bill, according to which the accident of birth or station shall not be considered an advantage or disadvantage. Existing titles may be retained as part of the name, but no fresh titles will be conferred. It has also been decided that no orders or decorations may be conferred by the State, and that no German may accept titles or orders from foreign Governments.HUNGARY.Attach on the Rumanians. The following message has been sent by Bela Kun to the President of the Peace Conference :  &quot; In view of the aggressive attitude of the Rumanians, who are defying die wishes of the Entente, we Avere compelled to cross the Theiss and to endeavour to make the Rumanians respect the wishes of the Entente &quot; (Budapest, July 21st).ITALY.The Strike abandoned. The Government succeeded in concluding agreements with the railwaymen, seamen, postal and telegraph employes whereby the general strike intended for July 2lst Avas averted (Sir R. Rodd, July 17th and ISth). On the morning of July 21st Sir R. Rodd telegraphed that perfect quiet prevailed in all parts of Italy.-1 Jugo-Slav Harbour. Sir R. Rodd learns that the Jugo-Slavs could establish a harbour at Klek as an alternative to Fiume. Kick is situated only eight miles from the existing railway system, and is perfectly protected with deep water. On the other hand, Fiume is commanded from the Italian heights.Signor NitlTs Policy. In an interview with Sir R. Rodd on July 20th, Signer Nitti stated that he had formed his cabinet in 36 hours. He realised that there was a certain amount of opposition to his Government among the general public, but he did not mind unpopularity. He had got rid of the feeble elements in the aclmini-stration, and had replaced them by the best material the public service afforded. He asserted that he could have obtained the support of the Federation of National Defence (the Fascio), but, in return for their co-operation, they had demanded too many places in the Ministry. Their opposition involved the loss of 45 Azotes. Signor Nitti went on to say that he intended to give all his time at first to regulating the internal situation. Signor Tittoni Avas therefore given a free hand in Paris. After the passage of electoral reforms and the adoption of the &quot; Scrutiri de liste,&quot; Signor Nitti hoped to be able to concentrate all his energies on securing good government. The Socialists Avere behaving well, and did not mean to allow matters to go too far, though they would not support him on a division. He Avas confident, liOAvever, that -his majority Avas safe.Signor Nitti said that he was on excellent terms Avith the high ecclesiastical authorities, his ideal being absolute religious liberty for all churches and religions.The question of Fiume Avas serious. The nation could not reconcile itself to handing oArer in the moment of Anctory 10,000 Italians, who Avere patriotic and had always looked forward to redemption, to their enemies. Moreover, the Slavs were generally believed to be in an inferior state of civilisation.He agreed with Sir Rodd that considerable clanger lay in the Press&apos;s campaign of misrepresentation, and promised to take the matter up.Sir R. Rodd sums up as follows the impressions he gained from the conversation : &quot;Signor Nitti, Avho gave me the impression of unlimited confidence in himself, has no doubt a difficult task before him, and no Ministry of all the many I remember in this country has entered office under such a fire of criticism and with such a hostile press. He has, on the other hand, great opportunities. The country has been so long without any Government to speak of, that people will Avelcome direction and the presence of a strong hand. I do not believe that Nitti has any preconceptions or intentions Avhich necessarily run counter to our interests, though the serious financialS426-ib B
situation of Italy will compel him to turn to any quarter which offers him a prospective of ameliorating it.   He must he an opportunist, even if he were not instinctively predisposed to he one, and I. think that if we handle the position discreetly it may not necessarily prove disadvantageous to us.&quot;NORWAY.Strike. Mr. Ovey reports that the general strike which was organised for Ju ly 21st passed oil&apos; very quietly particularly in Christiania, although some activity was shown in Stavauger and Trondhjem.Trains continued to run aud the electric current was maintained. Trams, bow-ever, stopped and no newspapers appeared. Most shops remained open. In christiania the intended procession did not take place as the Socialists feared that they could not muster enough demonstrators.The Moderate Socialist Group. According to the Tidens Tegn (July 7th), the new Socialist opposition group, which was founded at the general meeting last month, has now opened its campaign. Local branches are being formed, and propaganda meetings are being held in the provincial towns. President Buen, chairman of the group, delivered an important address in Skottum, denouncing the action of the extremists. The speaker declared that it was far from his intention to condemn the various revolutions in Europe : Norway, however, should not bind herself to such a course, but should be free to follow the line of action which promised the best results. Until the extremists proved to him that a revolution was necessary in Norway, he preferred to adhere to the parliamentary method, which had already procured such valuable concessions for the party.SPAIN.Resignation of the Cabinet. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Madrid reports that the Government was defeated in the Chamber - on July 15th by 22 votes. Parlia-mentary ratification of the decisions of the legal tribunals in disputed elections has proved the worst difficulty against which the Government has had to contend and the crisis occurred on a motion to ratify the decision of the tribunal in the disputed election at Coria.   As a result of its defeat the Government has resigned.After the failure of an attempt to form a Coalition Government of Maurists and Datists, a new Conservative Government was formed on July 20th from the-followers of Sehor Da to : President - Senor Sanchez Toca.Foreign Affairs     - - - Marques de Lema.Interior ----- Sehor Burgos.Finance    ----- Conde de Bugallal.Justice ----- Seiior Pascual Amat.War - - - -      - General Tovar.Marine  - - - - - Vice-Admiral Florez.Public Instruction - - -      - Sehor del Prado y Palicio.Supplies - Marques de Moehales.SWEDEN.Socialists and intervention in Russia. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Stockholm reported on July 19th that the Stockholm section of the Extreme Socialist Party is. organising four meetings in the environs of Stockholm as a demonstration against Entente intervention in Russia and Hungary. A resolution had been drawn up protesting against the peace terms in conjunction with the announcement of mass demonstrations in France, England, Italy, Germany and neutral countries. The revision of the peace terms and the resumption of friendly relations with Russia and Hungary was demanded. The means suggested to carry out these demands was refusal in all countries to transport troops and war material for anti-revolutionary purposes.The Stockholms Tidning states that certain groups of workmen have decided to-strike for 2-1 hours on July 21st.
At a meeting at Yesteras on July ISth a resolution was drawn up urging Swedish Labour organisations to compel the Government to resume relations with Russia within a fortnight.   Otherwise a general strike would be proclaimed.SWITZERLAND.The League of Nations. Speaking at the Federal Palace on July 17th to a meeting of Allied representatives, the Minister of Public Economy expressed the confident hope that all States would eventually be united in the organisation of the League of Nations.The G!oA&quot;ernmentis desirous that the Powers should accept the decision of the Federal Parliament to be made in September as sufficient authority for Switzerland&apos;s inclusion in the League. The risk of this decision being subsequently revoked by popular vote would be very remote (Lord Acton, July 17th).Meanwhile, the Government has instituted a series of conferences to educate opinion on the League and to prepare for the popular vote.Recognition as a Riparian State. According to a semi-official announcement in the Press, the Netherlands Government has addressed a Note to the Swiss Political Department recognising Switzerland as a riparian State of the Rhine, in possession of the privileges and rights connected therewith (Lord Acton, July 17th).New Minister for Berlin.  M. Plantol, who was Swiss Minister at Berne during the early years of the war, has been appointed to Berlin. He is friendly to Germany and an advocate of an Italian-German ravprochemerit (Lord Acton, July 23rd).THE UNITED STATES.The Peace Treaty. President Wilson is reported to be confident that the Treaty will be ratified. Some of the leading Democrats, who regard the Republican attack as a complete failure, seem more intent on scoring off their political opponents than on securing unanimous approval of the Treaty, but the President, by daily interviews and careful explanation, is endeavouring gradually to win Republican support. Several Republican Senators have been won over, but the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate is filled with irreconcilable opponents of the League. Though some of these have moderated their extreme views they are finding it difficult to back out of their original engagements.Tire President is strongly averse to making any amendments or reservations in the Treaty since such action would provide an excuse for any newly created State, which is dissatisfied with the terms, to demand similar amendments. Furthermore, the President thinks that united support of the League by the Great Powers is a necessary measure against the spread of Bolshevism throughout Europe. The only objection which may gain support in the country centres round the right to withdraw from the League. The President is satisfied that he has the support of the people, and, in the event of failure to win sufficient support in the Senate, intends to make a tour of the country.The President accuses the Irish extremists of deliberately attempting to wreck the League because it would prevent a war for the liberation of Ireland. The agitation against the Shantung settlement he thinks to be rather an expression of mistrust of Japan than due to any serious objection to the terms themselves (Mr. Lindsay, July 18th).Mr. Lindsay states that the Committee on Foreign Relations is now reading the Treaty, which is not expected to be disposed, of before the end of September. Senator Lodge declares that the Treaty cannot be passed without a reservation making-it clear that in no case shall the United States Government be under airy obligation, whether expressed or moral, to take any action merely at the behest of the League. Thirty-three Senators are said to be definitely pledged to make this a s&apos;me**qua non of ratification.The Irish Question. A reliable informant living in California states that the overwhelming majority of the Irish people in that State would vote for absolute severance from Great Britain. A nation-wide propaganda is being organised to sweep the United States in bringing pressure on the President.It is impossible to obtain support for a Home Rule scheme either on the public platform or through the Press, while any advocate of a Republic is granted, a hearing.
sRussian Soviet Bureau. The Home Office Directorate of Intelligence has issued a Memorandum (G.T. 7698) on the Russian Soviet Bureau in the United States. A raid on the offices of the Bureau, conducted on June 12th, disclosed the fact that the Bureau was organised By L. C. A. Iv. Martens, who claimed to he the representa-tive of the Soviet Government. Its ostensible purpose was to establish trade relations with Russia, but its more dangerous forms of activity included an active campaign of propaganda in the Press, especially in the New York Gall, the distribution of political literature, and the promotion, in connection with extremists of all sorts, of political unrest.PEACE DISCUSSIONS...Handbooks prepared in the Historical Section of the Foreign Office.
