SECRET.APPRECIATION&apos;  OF   III R  ATTACHED   WESTERN  AND GENERALREPORT No. 1J9.General (page 2).Further relaxations of trade restrictions are enumerated, and steps proposed for stopping the supply of food to Bolshevik Russia by Denmark and Switzerland are described.The Admiralty have furnished an important memorandum forecasting the relative strength of navies.Allied Countries.China (page 2). Considerable excitement has been caused by reports of the Shantung clause in the Peace terms with Germany, and by disclosure of the Anglo-Japanese compact of 1917.France (page 2). The Peace terms with Germany have on the whole been well received by the French Press.Italy (page 3). An interesting memorandum from the Foreign Office on the political situation is epitomised.The proposals for an Anglo-American guarantee to defend France have caused some disquietude ; so has the clause providing that the signatures of three. Great Powers suffice to make the terms offered to Germany effective.Southern Slav Slate-; (page 1). Both the King and the Foreign Minister seem opposed to the incorporation of Montenegro with Serbia.United States (page 5). The Peace terms have had a good Press.Enemy Countries.Austria-Hungary (page 5). The situation in Hungary at present is obscure.In Czecho--Slovakia a &apos;: German-Bohemian Government &quot; claims through German Wireless to exercise authority-Germany (page G). The expected agitation against the Peace terms continues, but there is little or no attempt to prove that any individual clause is opposed to the principles on which the Armistice was granted last November.The chief feature of the economic situation is reported to be shortage of coal and raw materials.N10utkal Countries.Baltic Provinces (page S). The reported readiness of Finland to provide men and money to Esthonia for an advance; on Petrograd is the chief item of interest in this week&apos;s reports. There is some suspicion of Admiral Koltchak in Esthonia. A. list of the new Government is given.The situation at Libau merits careful study. [t\t.o.
Denmark (page 9). There seems to be some prospect of Germans in the third (Southern) zone of Schleswig seeking to escape by plebiscite from Germany, thus avoiding their share of taxation necessary to satisfy the Peace terms. The Danish Government would evidently not welcome such procedure.Finland (page 9). The United States have recognised the Government de facto.Mexico (page 9).   Concerted action is reported amongst the various revolution-ary forces throughout the country.Netherlands (page 9). The Peace terms offered to Germany are strongly condemned in the Press.Sioeden (page 10). The Press disapproves on the whole of the Peace terms.Peace Discussions (page 10).The full text in English and French of the Peace terms has now been received (P. 119). The diary of procedure in Paris is continued from former Reports, It may be of interest to interpose a note here that there seems to be a general impression in most countries that the reception of a &quot;mandate&quot; is an advantage to the mandatory Power.G.

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Relaxation of Trade Restrictions. The Blockade Council lias passed a resolution permitting the export and re-export from the Northern Neutrals of indigenous products to Czecho-Slovakia, Poland, German-Austria, Rumania, and Greater Serbia, without Later-Allied Trade Committee licences. Consignments passing through Germany are excepted (Astoria, May 7th).On the question of additions to the free list, the Blockade Council has decided that it is not desirable in the present circumstances to make any considerable relaxation of the Blockade (Astoria, May 14th),Food Supplies. The Blockade Council has decided that the following resolution should be recommended by each delegate to his Government: &quot; That the Governments of Denmark and Switzerland be requested forthwith to give an engagement that except with the permission of the Associated Governments, foodstuffs will not be exported or re-exported to Bolshevik Russia &quot; (Astoria, May 7th).Forged Notes. Mr. Clive (Stockholm) is informed that up to about April 21st one pound and ten shilling notes to the value of 373,000Z. and 100 and 1,000 franc notes to the value of 7,000,000 francs were manufactured at the plant established for that purpose in Petrograd. The character of the informant is, however, open to suspicion.Relative strength of Navies. Attention is directed to a Memorandum (G.T. 7229) circulated by the Admiralty on the relative strength of Navies.ALLIED GROUP.CHINA.The Shantung Question. Sir J. Jordan reports that the cession of Shantung to Japan and the disclosure of the Anglo-Japanese secret compact of 1917 is causing considerable excitement throughout China. Students in Peking organised a demon-stration in Peking to demand justice for China. The house of Tsao-ju-Lin, a paid agent of Japan who negotiated the Shantung Railway Extensions, was burnt.COSTA RICA.Invasion. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Panama has received a report to the effect that the revolutionaries from Nicaragua (vide Report No. 118, page 4) have established themselves within the border of Costa Rica. The Costa Rica Government is mobilising troops and moving them to the frontier.FRANCE.The Peace Terms. The Summary of the peace terms has been well received by the greater part of the French Press. Most writers dwell with satisfaction upon the covenant between Great Britain, the United States and France though M. Bainville (Action Franeaise) considers the Alliance a proof that at the last moment something was recognised to be lacking in the Peace Treaty, and M. Letailleur (Democratic
ITALY.Political Situation. A Memorandum (G.T. 7212) on the internal affairs of Italy has been circulated by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office. The Memorandum deals with (1) the General Election and Electoral Reform. There appears to be a cleavage between the two sections of the Press which support Baron Sonnino and Signor Orlando respectively. The former asserts that the General Election is likely to be postponed until October to allow the discussion of electoral reform. L&apos;Epoca on the other hand, which is generally supposed to represent Signor Orlando&apos;s views, is emphatic on the necessity for replacing the old Chamber without delay. While it would appear that Baron Sonnino fears the probable democratic temper of a new Chamber, Signor Orlando has given proof of a desire to conciliate the Giolittians by appointing Signor Corradini to the post of the &quot; Chef du Cabinet &quot; to the Minister of the Interior. (2) Socialist programmes. At meetings held from March 18th to March 22nd the Direction of the Official Socialist Party hailed the German and Hungarian revolutions as real Socialist movements and- denounced the Paris Conference as being the Holy Alliance in modern disguise. A resolution was carried &quot;to&apos; retire from the Socialist Internationalist Bureau (stigmatised as an. &quot; instrument of pseudo-democratic bourgeois war policy) and to adhere to and work &quot; for the constitution of the revolutionary Socialist International on. the basis and &quot; principles established by our communist Russian comrades.&quot; The Parliamentary group, though denouncing the work of the Paris Conference, appears to have decided to endeavour to moderate the extreme programme of the Direction. The common manifestoNouvelle) declares that Anglo-American support for France in the event of future aggression is valueless in the light of past experience and humiliating for France in its essence. A few reactionaries, such as M. Leon Daudet (Action Francaise) condemn the peace as being too lenient.The France Libre (moderate Socialist) expresses the opinion that on a superficial examination the Treaty aiDpears to ensure to the Allies, and especially France, the certainty of future peace, but regrets that peace is not based on a stronger organisation of the Society of Nations. The majority of the Socialist Press is, however, frankly antagonistic. IIumanite describes the Treaty as &quot;a Peace of violence of -veracious Imperialism and of iniquity,&quot; as a diplomatic document which &quot; history will consider-as a criminal breach of a sworn promise and an outrage to morality and right.&quot; It protests against the clavrses concerning the Sarre Valley and the German Colonies. Phedon (Popidaire) brands the Treaty as &quot;a second Brest-Litovsk&quot; (Lord Derby, April Sth and 9th).French Socialist Party and the International. At the National Socialist Congress held last mouth M. Longuet&apos;s motion on the International received the majority of votes.   The chief points in the motion were : Whatever reservations may be.made upon its composition and its resolutions, the Conference (Berne) has proved that it was possible, in spite of the hatred accumulated by 53 months of Avar, to group the workers of the world in a single class organisation, in view of their total liberation.The Party notes with rejoicing this re-establishment of contact between the proletarians of all countries.It urgently invites those sections which were not represented at Berne to send delegates to the next International Congress, in order (1) To proceed (under the direction of the International and in the affiliated sections) to the necessary purging.(2) Tore-establish in full vigour the principles of class war and of unrelenting opposition to the bourgeois parties and Governments.(3) To direct, the International clearly and immediately towards the social revolu-tion, after the example of Russia, Hungary, and Germany.It is for the support and triumph of this policy that the Socialist Party declares for the present its adhesion to the International Socialist Bureau.Meanwhile, the Socialist Party declares its determination to preserve fraternal relations as far as material circumstances permit it, with the Moscow organisation, and particularly with the Socialist Parties of Russia, Italy, and Switzerland, which are affiliated with it.
issued by tbe Republican Party and tbe (Patriotic&quot;) Socialist Union and tbat of the Radical Party do not greatly differ. The tone adopted is that if the governing classes would avoid Bolshevism they must of their own free will put the people in a position to realise their aspirations in a constitutional manner. The writer of the Memorandum does not think that the danger of a revolution on a large scale is imminent. (3) Anti-British and anti-American feeling. With the exception of the Germanophil and. extreme Chauvinist papers anti-Allied feeling is practically confined to criticism of the Jugo-Slav question and financial and economic measures. (4) Vatican affairs. The Memorandum declares that &quot; tbe new party (Partito Populare Italiano) the formation of which was at least connived at by the Vatican, represents the tendency towards a Concordat. But the clerical view seems to be that, given the presence of the Holy See in the capital of the kingdom of Italy, the present relation of latent but unresolved discord is the only effective means of establishing in the eyes of the world the independence of the Papacy vis-a-vis the civil power.&quot;The Peace Terms - The first reception of the peace terms by the more serious organs in Italy was not unfavourable. But uncertainty regarding the settlement with Italy encourages criticism which is becoming every day more acute.The Secolo finds it inconceivable that French opposition to the German-Austrian right to self-determination should have prevailed, and holds the decision to be contrary to Italian interests.The Milan Corriere argues that Austria will be compelled to co-operate with the Southern Slavs and Hungarians, thus re-establishing the pre-existing conditions of menace to Italy.The Trihuna declares that Italy-s exclusion from colonial mandates must be compensated in a liberal spirit.General and growing apprehension is expressed regarding the British and American guarantee to defend France as constituting a new Triple Alliance from which Italy is excluded.There is also much excited discussion of the clause establishing that the Treaty shall take effect if ratified by only three of the Great Powers, which is assumed to reflect upon the possibility of I.taly&apos;s separation (Sir R. Rodd, May 11th).Adriatic Commission. After discussion with Admiral De Bon, who considers that the Adriatic Commission is invaluable and enables the Allied Governments to obtain information first-hand, it has been decided to continue the Commission for the present (Admiralty Weekly Appreciation, May 3rd).&apos; JAPAN.Corean Unrest. The United States Consul at Seoul has prepared a report dealing with atrocities committed by Japanese troops in revenge for demonstrations conducted by some of the inhabitants of that district. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Tokio met the complaints of the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the attitude of the Peace Conference on the racial equality question by drawing his attention to these atrocities (Mr. Alston, May 5th).SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Montenegro. Count de Salis appreciates the situation as follows: A delegate of the Serbian Government has assumed the powers of the Montenegrin Provisional Government which has been broken up, while Serbians have superseded Montenegrins in the provincial prefectures. The Serbians have got a tight hold on Antivari and have detained their political opponents in prison. In these circumstances the task of ascertaining the wishes of the people is one of great difficulty.Lord Derby has received a note from the Montenegrin Minister for Foreign Affairs protesting against the omission of the name of Montenegro from the official report of the Allied delegates who attended the Plenary. Meeting of April 28th in connection with the Covenant of the League of Nations. A further note demands that Montenegro should receive a formal invitation to share in the discussion of the preliminaries and conclusion of peace with Austria and Hungary.The King has complained to Sir G. Grahame to the same effect. He appears to be convinced that his people desire his return and that they abominate the Serbian yoke.
ENEMY GROUP.A USTRIA-HUN GARY.Hungary. A Budapest Wireless report of May 7th contains the following announcement: &quot; With a view to preventing further bloodshed the Hungarian SoAuet Republic has sent parlementaires to the opposing Rumanian troops, in order to enquire under \A-hat conditions Rumania would be prepared to conclude an armistice and to cease hostilities.&quot;On May 3rd the Soviet Government received the terms irpon which Rumania was prepared to cease hostilities. Rumanian demands included (1) the immediate disarming of all troops Avhich have fought against Rumania and the surrender of their equipment; (2) subsequent disarming of troops fighting against Rumania&apos;s allies; (3) surrender of a specified quantity of railway and other material; (4) the deliA^ery to Rumania of all shipping on the Theiss betAveen Csap and Szegedin ; (5) repatriation without reciprocity of all prisoners of war and civilian hostages. Until these conditions were carried out Rumanian troops were to remain on the right bank of the Theiss to a depth of 20 kilometres at all the important crossings, after which they were to evacuate Hungarian territory up to the ethnographical frontier claimed by Rumania. These terms were refused. On May 12th The Times published a telegram from Berne stating that as a result of the intervention of the British and American Missions, the Rumanian Army had been obliged to cease its inarch on Budapest.On May 4th the head of the British Mission at Vienna received a telegram from Budapest to the effect that the Rumanian Army had stopped its advance and had not-crossed the Theiss. As a result the position of the Hungarian Government had been strengthened. Bela Ivun was stated to be clinging to Avhat remained of Hungary as a Communist centre from AAdrich to issue propaganda throughout the world (Lord Derby, May 6th).&apos; The Rumanian Government has presented a Note to the four Ministers at Bucharest, urging the occupation of Budapest as the best means of preventing the re-establishment of the Hungarian Army and its co-operation Avith Bolshevik Russia (Lord Derby, May 6th).The Hungarian Military Report of May 12th claims successes against the Czecho-Slovaks both in the neighbourhood of Salgo-Tarjan and Miskolcz. The report concludes : &quot; Our troops are fighting with the greatest enthusiasm and confidence. Under the influence of victory, discipline is improving day by day.&quot;Hungarian Socialisation Schemes. A committee is being appointed to examine the questions of specialisation for factories, the closure of unproductiA^e businesses,7904-31 bThe Adriatic Question. The publication of President Wilson&apos;s statement on the Adriatic question and Fiume was made the occasion for loyal demonstrations in Belgrade, during which the United States &quot;Minister received a special ovation (Sir C. des Graz, May 5th and 6th).Danube Navigation. Measures for the reorganisation of the navigation of the /Danube are being considered by the Supreme Economic Council (Astoria, May 10th).UNITED STATES.The IJcace Terms. Mr. Barclay states that the summary of the Peace Treaty has been received with marked favour by the Press and by the public generally. The only criticism appears in the Sun, which considers that &quot; the extreme territorial and economic penalties &quot; breathe of bitter and future wars. &apos; The majority of the Senate is expected to favour the terms.Congress. Congress has been summoned in Extra Session on May 19th (Mr. Barclay, May Sth).
the amalgamation of the smaller retail businesses into a joint concern, the erection of water-power stations, the exploitation of petroleum gas (Budapest, May Stli).Hungarian National Committee. Lord Acton learns that proposals &quot;have been made in certain quarters for the creation of a Hungarian National Committee for the protection of all non-Bolshevik Hungarians in foreign countries,German Bohemia. The following announcement is made in a German Wireless message from Nauen (May 8th): &quot;The German-Bohemian Government has protested to the Entente against the action of the Czechs who are occupying the country, and called the attention oE the nations represented at Paris to the behaviour of the ,Czechs, which is contrary to international law/&apos;On May 3rd Dr. von Langenhahn, the Deputy Landeshauptmann of German Bohemia, called at the British Legation at Berne. He stated that he wished to put the case of his compatriots before the Peace Conference, and he hoped that, at auy rate, the British Government would not allow the fate of the three and a half millions of Germans in Bohemia to be settled without their being allowed to give expression to their wishes as regards their own future. Czechs have behaved with such brutality as to render any understanding between the two races impossible. If the German Bohemians were abandoned to the Czechs, rebellion would ensue. For this reason the German Bohemians wished to appeal to the Allied Powers before it was too late. They desired that, if possible, a plebiscite should be taken in German Bohemia -with British or American troops present to prevent intimidation of the voters by the Czechs. Such a plebiscite would, Dr. Langenhahn asserted, show that 99 per cent, of the population -was in favour of separation from Bohemia and incorporation in German Austria (Lord Acton, May 5th).Navigation on the Danube. The Government of Czecho-Slovakia is reported to intend enlarging the harbour of Pressburg to a. receiving capacity of 100,000 tons, and as soon as the Iron Gates are free the Danube is to be navigated by ships large enough to navigate in the Black and Mediterranean Seas (Admiralty Weekly Appre-ciation, May 3rd).GERMANY.The Peace Terms. The attitude of the German Press towards the Peace terms is sufficiently clear from the extracts which have been published in The Times and other newspapers during the past week. The speeches of Herren Ebert, Scheidemann, and Fehrenbach have also been reported. Speeches of protest have also been made by Herr Hirsch in Prussian and Herr Kiel in the Wurttemburg Assembly (Nauea, May 10th).Nauen circulates on May 12th a long manifesto to the working peoples of all lands protesting against the action of the militarist and capitalist elements in the Allied and Associated Powers, and appealing to the proletariat of all lands to unite and demand their rights.At the Assembly of the Berlin Workmen&apos;s Councils, Richard Midler explained the attitude of the Independent Socialists. He said that the party demanded the immediate convocation of a Congress of Councils, so that the German Councils could define their position with &quot;regard to the peace question. The Workmen&apos;s Councils appeal to the sense of humanity and the socialist conscience of the proletariat in Entente countries, and expect them to show a firm front against this peace of violence.Economic Outlook. The following passage is taken from the Economic Report of May 5th, issued by the Berlin Foreign Office: &quot;Reports which have reached the Imperial Statistical Department show that no material alteration has occurred in the unfavourable economic situation in March, as compared with the month before it. The shortage of coal and raw materials, the difficult conditions of traffic, and also the shortening of the hours of labour, together with continuous increases in wages, reductions in output, and an increasing indisposition for work, continue to have a depressing effect. The isolation of the occupied territories of Germany, the shortage of ore in tlie industrial districts of Rhenish-Westphalia, -which is assuming menacing proportions, the interruption of communications with the Eastern Provinces, strikes and political disturbances result in further difficulties for industry. The demand for the removal of the economic blockade, and also for enlightenment as to the future development of economic policy, both in the country itself and in such states as
concern German trade, is making itself more and more insistently heard. The principal branches of industry offer the same unfavourable picture as the previous month, even though individual concerns may have experienced a slight improvement.&quot;Trade Councils. Trade Councils are being formed by the Minister of Labour to take the place of the present Committees of employees and officials (Naueh, May 8th).Conditions in Bavaria. An Interim Report (G.T. 7236) on the conditions in Bavaria has been made by Lieutenant G. H. Beyfua who visited Wiirzburg and Nurnberg between March 31st and April Sth. The report deals with (1) Food Supplies. The scale of rations has remained nearly the same since the declaration of the armistice, excepting that in both Nurnberg and Wiirzburg the potato ration has been reduced, and in the latter town the fat ration has also decreased. (2) Clothing. The lack of clothing is as serious as that of food and must be considered as au important contributory factor to the prevailing unrest. (3) Military Situation. The troops of the 2nd and 3rd Bavarian Army Corps are thoroughly demoralised. Few officers wear uniform and a large number of men are fed in barracks in order to prevent them swelling the ranks of the unemployed. (4) Attitude of the people. The population, whose hopes were raised by the armistice, is now plunged in the depths of despair. Food, which can be bought at reasonable prices, is stated to be the only means of opposing Bolshevism.Poland. The following statement is published in the German Wireless Report of May 11th :-&quot; A message signed by the &apos; Upper Silesiau Freedom Committee, Oppeln,&apos; states that there is tremendous agitation in Upper Silesia concerning the proposed handing-over of the province to Poland. At a monster demonstration in Oppeln, which was attended by at least 25,000 persons of all parties, both German and Polish-speaking, a resolution was adopted, calling on the Imperial Government not to abandon Upper Silesia and declaring that the population were firmly resolved in the last resort to have recourse to self-defence.&quot;According to a report from Posen (May 12thj the Germans are withdrawing all their troops from the Bolshevik front aud are bringing them to West Prussia in preparation for an attack on the Polish northern front. The best units of the German&apos; Army which have been employed in suppressing Spartacist movements in Berlin, Munich and the Ruhr district, are being concentrated on the Polish frontier; they are replacing the frontier Defence Corps which is not considered suflicieutly disciplined to undertake serious fighting.Saxony and the Empire. The Leipziger Tageblatt, of April 20th publishes a remonstrance sent by herr Gradnauer, the Prime Minister of Saxony, to Herr Fehrenbach, President of the National Assembly. The Saxon Government, in agreement with the Governments of the South German States, issues a warning against excessive centralisation. In her own interest and that of the Empire, Saxony must lay great stress on the continuance of an undivided, strong and powerful Prussia, and the Empire must not be allowed to sink back again into the numerous little States of the Middle Ages. The remonstrance demands for the individual States greater legislative freedom and extended control over their own sources of revenue.NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.Industrial Situation. Sir R. Tower reports that there is a little improvement in the situation at the port of Buenos Ayres. Boycotts are still numerous and have interfered with the shipment of cereals for the British Government.At a meeting held on May Sth the employers decided to organise combined opposition to the growing demands of labour and to resist the recognition of Labour Societies and their interference with internal administration.
BALTIC PROVINCES.Military Situation. (1) General. According to information furnished by (lie Esthonian General Staff the army consists of 02,100 men, composed of 52,200 Esthonians, 5,500 Russians, 3,000 Letts. 900 Baltic Germans, 250 Swedes and Finns and 150 Danes. Enemy forces on all fronts are reckoned at about 65,000 men, consisting of 38 Russian, 1-1 Lettish, and 4 Esthonian regiments (Mr. Bosanquet, May 10th).General Udenich, who has been appointed by Admiral Koltchak to conduct the political affairs of the Russian armies in the North-West, is reported to be in daily communication with the Staff of the Northern Army at Reval. The Esthonian political leaders are, however, hostile to him and suspicious of Koltchak&apos;s intentions (Mr. Bosanquet, May 4th).The Finnish Government is prepared to furnish 10,000 men and 10 million marks for Esthonia in order to participate in an advance upon Petrograd (Mr. Bosanquet, May 5 th).(2) Esthonian Front. In the Volmar district Red Lettish troops have occupied a series of villages south of Salisburg (Moscow, May 9th),.and south of Verro (Moscow, May 12th).The Situation at Libau.. Negotiations for the formation of a coalition Govern-ment under the leadership of M. Ulmanis have failed owing to the withdrawal of the Conservative Letts. The latter were probably induced to take this step by the Germans Avho fear, if M. Ulmanis were in power, the pro-German landowners would be unable to give grants of land to German volunteers. Meanwhile, a few Conservative Letts and the Baltic Party have formed a pro-German Cabinet with M. Needra as Prime Minister. This Government only represents a small minority of the population and has done nothing towards creating a national Lett Army. Mr. Grant Watson advocates the strict imposition of the blockade (Mr. Grant Watson, May 1.1th and 12th).General von der Goftz left for Berlin on May 8th to take part in the inquiry on the recent coup cietat.During the last week of April the Swedish Press published the manifestoes issued by-the Baltic Legation and the Lettish representative at Stockholm relating to the coup cVetat. The Baltic Legation asserted that the Lettish Government was utterly unable to carry on the defence of the country. Newly mobilised troops were untrustworthy, and several members of the Cabinet were in communication with the Bolsheviks. Ballod and Liewen, in whom the supreme authority was subsequently A^ested, Avere themselves of Lettish origin. The Lettish representative accused the Baltic Barons of sole responsibility for the coup. The Barons wished to preserve their privileges, and the charge of Bolshevism Avas only a pretence.Esthonia.- Mr. Bosanquet announces that the new Government has been formed as follows : Prime Minister and Minister for War      -   Mr. Strandmann (Labour Party).Interior     - .  - Mr. Ornas (Social Democrat).Education . . . Mr. Kartau (Social Democrat).Industry, Trade, and Communications    -   Mr. Kotner (Social Democrat).Finance        - - - -   Mr. Kukk (Labour Party).Agriculture - Mr. Pool (Labour Party).Foreign Affairs        ...   Mr. Poska (People&apos;s Party).Justice     - - - -   Mr. Jaakson (People&apos;s Party).The Ministers of the Labour and People&apos;s Parties have formed a coalition and possess a majority in the Cabinet. Their policy includes (1) compensation for the appropriation of land, (2) continuation of the war, (3) prorogation of the Constituent Assembly in the event of its opposition to such policy.Mr. Poska. fears that the poprdation may be influenced in favour of peace with the BolsheAnks. Bolshevik propaganda is active among the troops, and has met with some success, but recently the position at the front has improved. Much depends upon the Governments land policy and the attitude of the Entente (Mr. Bosanquet, May 4th and 10th).Sir C. Marling reports that application has been made by the Esthonian representative at Copenhagen for the provision of 6,000 tons of barley and oats Jor sowing.
CHILE.Political Crisis. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Santiago reported on May 9th that a subversive military movement had been frustrated by the arrest and dismissal of a number of officers. The official version is that these officers intended to support the executive power of the President as against an incompetent Government. Grave discontent exists among the working classes, with whom the army is said to be in sympathy. The governing classes are accused of being undemocratic and of sacrificing national interests for their own ends.DENMARK.Tfie Schleswig Question. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Sir C. Marling that the provisions of the Peace Terms dealing with Schleswig are a somewhat unpleasant surprise. He foresees that the German population in the third zone to which the plebiscite is to be applied will endeavour to escape the onerous peace terms imposed on Germany by voting in favour of annexation by Denmark. This would give Denmark a larger German population than she could absorb. The Danish Minister at Paris has been instructed to press for modification of the terms.Labour and the Peace Terms. Sir C. Marling learns that a movement is being-organised among the working classes to protest against the Peace terms. Herr Borbjerg, the Socialist leader, is said to be behind it.Bolshevism. According to a Report circulated by the Home Secretary on revolutionary movements abroad (G.T. 7219), more than six hundred &quot; Syndicalist Bolshevik Workshop Clubs &quot; are said to have been formed since February 1st. They meet twice weekly to discuss Bolshevik agitation. Travelling agitators are financed from headquarters.FINLAND.Recognition. The United States Government has recognised the independence of Finland in the following terms : &quot;In view of the fact that the people of Finland have established a representative Government, the Government of the United States declares that it recognises the Government so constituted as the de facto Government of an independent Finland &quot; (Mr. Barclay, May Sth).The Invasion of Russia. The Soviet Government has addressed a note to the Finnish Government protesting against the invasion of Russian territory hy Finnish regular troops and Russian White Guards, with the sanction of the Finnish Govern-ment, and also against atrocities committed by them on the civil population, during their temporary occupation of the town of Olonetz.Olonetz has again been abandoned by the Bolshevik forces (Moscow, May 12th).MEXICO.Revolutionist Activity. The activity of the revolutionaries continues. Mr. Cummins reports the frequent destruction of trains accompanied by loss of life among the passengers. On May 7th the electric transmission cables to the capital Avere cut, with the result that business was paralysed. There are indications of concerted action among tha revolutionary forces throughout the country.The revolutionist leader, Angeles, who has agreed to support Robles Dominguez, is reported to have defeated the Government troops in the north. The Government is sending reinforcements drawn from other parts of Mexico.NETHERLANDS.Press Criticism on the Peace Terms. The Avhole Dutch Press severely condemns the Peace terms.Most violent is the Neue Rotterdam Courant which claims that peace is not peace but merely a prolongation of war Avith only one side fighting, and that one only with the economic Aveapons which enabled it to having the war. The Treaty by cataloguing nations as (1) conquerors, (2) semi-independent, and (3) outcasts, has destroyed all hope of that better Avorld, the establishment of Avhich might have been expected from the principles of the League of Nations.   The only relationship that Treaty has Avith7994-3!) 0
President Wilson&apos;s programme is that it reverses all its points. As regards violent injustice and germs of new wars tire Treaties of Frankfurt and Brest-Litovsk were ckild&apos;s play. Handioerblad is less violent in language, but almost more scathing in meaning. It calls the peace a mockery of Wi.lsoii&apos;s principles which were accepted hy Germany because she trusted in them. The writer sees no sense in punishing Germany so severely, however guilty she has been, and considers the peace does not ( differ essentially from the terms imposed upon vanquished people by ancient Rome (Sir W. Townley, May 9th).Examination of Vessels. Protests have been lodged by the Dutch authorities at Rotterdam regarding the manner in which vessels bringing Germans from China and other overseas parts are examined by the British military authorities (Sir W. Townley, May 11th).SWEDEN.Press Comments on the Peace Terms. The Conservative Press is unanimous in emphasising the harshness of the terms. The Dagens Nyheter Liberal says that the peace terms are much nearer Wilson&apos;s programme than had been expected, but considers the economic conditions alarming (even for neutral countries) and takes exception particularly to the regulation of Germany&apos;s East frontier. The Social Demokraten says that though the most extreme claims have been repudiated, what remains is sufficient to infuriate the entire German people. Harshest are the economic terms. The impression is gained that Germany not merely loses her colonies but actually is herself being turned into a colony. The Goteborgs Ilandels Tidning Liberal declares that &quot; this great nation is doomed to years of slavery in &quot; serving her conquerors. This is not peace but an attempt to annihilate a great &quot; nation which will avenge itself&quot; (Mr. Clive, May 9th).Aland Islands. The text of the British note recognising the Finnish government-ment, in which it is stated that any attempt to anticipate the decision of the Peace Conference concerning the determination of the Finnish frontier by force of arms is to be prevented by the British Government, is interpreted by the whole Swedish Press to refer not only to the Finnish eastern frontier but also to the question of the Aland Islands (Mr. Clive, May 12th).SWITZERLAND.The Vorarlberg. According to a telegram from Berne dated May 12th, published in The Times, the plebiscite on union with Switzerland resulted in 45,466 votes in types^our of the union, and 11,029 votes against it. The Swiss Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Lord Acton that the majority of the Federal Government are opposed to the annexation of the Vorarlberg on racial and religious groimds, but that they will be influenced by the result of the plebiscite.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.Handbooks prepared in the Historical Section of the Foreign Office.
