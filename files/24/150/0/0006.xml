WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.general.Repatriation of Prisoners (1) Germany. According to a telegram received from The&apos;Hagiie on December 30th, the Dutch Minister at Berlin estimates that there are 36,000 British prisoners still in Germany. His Majesty the King has sent a Christmas message to these men Avishing them a speedy home-coming. According to a statement issued on January 1st by the Inter-departmental Committee on Prisoners of War, 6,565 officers, 119,357 other ranks, and 4,438 civilians have been repatriated since the signing of the Armistice.According to a Memorandum by the Home Secretary some 24,000 prisoners are ready to be repatriated from Hamburg and Bremenhaven. Only one British transport is at present available for this purpose and it is urged that, in view of the condition of the prisoners, a certain amount of German tonnage should be allotted for the repatriation of these prisoners. Attention is also drawn to the delay in getting prisoners from certain camps to the Baltic Ports and Holland, and the Home Secretary suggests that the German proposal for the utilisation of a portion of the rolling-stock handed over to the Allies under the terms of the Armistice should be acceded to. On December 31st it was reported that there remained 6,000 men to be repatriated via the Baltic ports. Their repatriation should be completed within a fortnight.The camps at Klein Wittenberg, Grieshelm, Graudenz, Ingolstadt, Mannheim, Karlsruhe, Pjorzheim, Sennelager, Chemnitz, Heilsberg, Stargardt, Czersk, Stralsund, and in Baden and Wurtemburg have been evacuated.His Majesty&apos;s Government is making every effort to allocate German ships, and to send locomotives and carriages into Germany for the transport of prisoners.According to a report which has reached Sir H. Rumbold from Vienna (December 20th) a number of prisoners in Germany are still made to work in mines, in factories and in the fields.The Dutch Minister at Berlin has been requested to provide the British Govern-ment with a scheme for searching camps, asylums, mines, and prisons on the conclusion of repatriation, so as to make certain that all British prisoners of war have been accounted for.On December 21st Mr. Robertson (The Hague) transmitted a message from the Netherlands Minister in Berlin, suggesting that General Ewart, whose official position Avas only7 that of senior Red Cross delegate, should hold combatant rank. The Minister thought that this would increase his influence in dealing with British prisoners, avIio, although their discipline had been generally exemplary, Avere shoAving some signs of unrest owing to the lack of discipline among prisoners of other nations and the relaxation of German control. There is. an instance of this growing unrest at Soltau camp, where the men refuse to do any work or to clean the barracks.   The two officers in the camp are unable to control the men.Mr. Robertson reported on December 26th that .100,000 parcels for prisoners had reached their destination, a distributing centre having been established at Hameln.The Dutch Minister thinks that there is no longer any danger of starvation in the camp in Avhich British prisoners are situated.(2) Denmark. The Danish Government has acceded to Lord KilmarnoolFs requests. Sufficient trucks have been provided to meet the needs of the Red Cross up to December 28th, and British prisoners are to be allowed to cross the frontier from Germany to Denmark, provided they come in batches of not less than 50, and that previous notice is given.(3) Switzerland. The French Government has informed the Federal Government that Article 10 of the Armistice overrides my preAdous agreements made with
Germany -with, regard to prisoners, and that therefore the return to Germany of prisoners interned in Switzerland cannot be permitted.(4) Russian. Prisoners. The French Government reports that some 20,000 Russian prisoners have arrived in the Allied lines in a state of extreme destitution. It is proposed, after examination, to form from these prisoners small units which will be sent to General Denikin&apos;s army. The remainder will be used as far as possible as agricultural labourers. The French High Command, however, states that it is impossible to receive further batches of Russian prisoners, and the Germans have therefore been instructed by Marshal Foch to take back all Russian prisoners with them in their retreat.The French Government draws attention to the danger arising from Russian prisoners being sent hack by the Germans to Russia where, finding no other means of subsistence, they will be forced to join the Red Army. Many of them, especially in Austria-Hungary, may die on the road. The French Government seeks British co-operation in supporting the proposal of the International Red Cross Committee to send missions to Berlin and Vienna, aud has decided to place 500,000 francs at the disposal of the Committee for the organisation of collecting-camps beyond the Russian frontier.Sir II. Rumbold has been requested by the Russian Red Cross to allocate British surplus supplies to the Russian officer prisoners in Germany, whose. number is estimated at 30,000. It is suggested that such action would produce a good effect on the orderly elements in Russia, aud would forestall the Americans who are understood to he undertaking relief measures.Cable Censorship. The Foreign Office learns that the abolition of the cable censorship is being - considered by certain Allied Governments. His Majesty&apos;s Government is of the opinion that the retention of the cable censorship is essential for the Inter-Allied control of foodstuffs and raw materials, and for the maintenance of the blockade. Any measures in this respect should therefore be taken jointly by the Allied Governments.Austro-Hungarian Shipping. It has been agreed that Austro-Hungarian ships are to be put into service by the nation able to do so most rapidly. The Naval Committee at Venice, the four naval attaches at Madrid, and the High Commissioners at Constantinople are to be responsible for seeing that the principles of the agreement are carried out with regard to Austro-Hungarian ships lying in Adriatic, Spanish and Black Sea ports respectively.Supplies for Germany. His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has circulated a note from the Swiss Minister, which contains a protest from the German Government against the decision that the transport of supplies between the evacuated territory on the left bank of the Rhine and the neutral zones, and through them to the rest of Germany, must be interrupted on the ground that the maintenance of the Blockade was provided for by the Armistice.Black Lists. Mr. Barclay reports that the War Trade Board, which has received numerous complaints of the unfair use of local black lists, has transmitted a circular telegram to all the Missions and Consuls in&quot; Latin America, Cuba, and the West Indies to the effect that they are to advise all local associations and associations of Allied business houses to discontinue any black list for which they are responsible, and which is at variance with the lists published by the Allied Governments.under the direction of properly constituted Boards.
allied group.CHINA.&apos;        &apos; - &apos;       ; - -  .   . - :, ,   . &apos; . ...... . &apos; -      &apos;  ,:.     (British Prestige. Sir J. Jordan considers it very important that British prestige should not suffer through colonies such as Hong Kong and Singapore being left largely to the protection of Japanese warships. He therefore urges the despatch of a strong British squadron to the Far East. Such action is equally important for British trade interests.Enemy Subjects. Sir J. Jordan has been instructed to request the United States Minister to agree to the general repatriation of all enemy subjects, unless, in the opinion of Sir J. Jordan, efforts should be confined to securing the removal of undesirable enemy subjects only. The British Ministry of Shipping is prepared to allocate a number of vessels for their transport (vide Report No, 99, page 3).CUBA.Labour Unrest. Mr. Barclay learns that a renewal of strikes, with serious consequences, is imminent. His informant, who had just returned from Cuba, considered that the landing of American troops would only aggravate the trouble and might result in the destruction of all American-owned sugar. The appearance, however, of a British warship might have a salutary effect on the strikers. In a subsequent discussion with Mr. Polk, the latter stated that the United States authorities were prepared for all eventualities. Mr. Barclay gathered that the United States Government preferred to act without British assistance, but suggests that a note should be addressed to that Government requesting it to give adequate protection to British interests in Cuba.Enemy Subjects. Mr. Cowan (Havana) reports that all interned enemy subjects except seven were released on December 24th by order of the Administration. They are still to be kept under police surveillance. This action was taken without consulting the United States Legation.FRANCE.The King of Italy&apos;a Visit. On December 18th, Lord Derby reported that the principal organs of the French Press were publishing sympathethic but not enthusiastic articles on the King of Italy&apos;s visit to Paris. The Socialist Deputy, Marcel Sembat, in the Heure, recognises as legitimate Italy&apos;s desire to develop and to take her place among the great nations, but affirms that her territorial aspirations must not be allowed to stand in the way of Mr. Wilsoips principles. Those, he says, who sympathise with the risorgimenlo of Italy should also sympathise with the neigh-bouring risorgimento of the Jugo-Slavs. &quot;M. Gauvain, in the Journal des Debats, eulogises the King, but declares that he has not always had the Ministers he deserved. Giolittism, he says, has left poisoned traces, and the old mark of the Triple Alliance has not entirely disappeared. Part of the political and diplomatic personnel in Italy-continues to be impregnated with methods learnt in Germany. On December 20th Lord Derby reported that the enthusiasm of the Press had increased. M. Herve, in the Victoire, declares that if Italy holds to the Treaty of London, the French must honour their signature. &quot; Italy and France have too great a need of each other in front of the Germanic block (Germany and German-Austria) of 70 millions of inhabitants, to quarrel over what is, after all, a secondary question, the solution of which, whatever it may be, will always be contrary to absolute justice.&quot; He goes on to plead for the formation of a vast Latin Alliance as a step towards a League of Nations. The Action Francaise declares that Italy is the advanced sentinel of order in the South-East and the barrier against Germany in the Adriatic, as France is on
the Rhine. The Temps sees hope of a solution of the Jugo-Slav problem in the Iviug&apos;s words at the Elysee : &quot; Italy will always be opposed to-any project of violent domination such as our enemies tried to impose upon the world.&quot;Russian Policy. According to a Press report M. Pichon has informed the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Chamber that the Allies intend to continue their policy of supporting the local Governments in Russia which are desirous of freeing themselves from Bolshevism, but will not extend the sphere of military intervention. The following resolution has been passed by the permanent Administrative Committee of the Socialist Party : &quot; The Committee notes with satisfaction the declaration of the semi-official Press announcing that the Entente renounce further military intervention in Russia. This is ihe first- result due to the vigorous protest of the English Labour Party and the French and Italian working classes.&quot; The Committee further demands the withdrawal of the troops now in Russia aud the cessation of the blockade which results in the starvation of the Russian people. M. Marcel Cachin, in Humanite, expresses his satisfaction that the scheme for a great anti-Bolshevist expedition in Russia has been abandoned, but deplores the fact that Allied forces are still engaged there. In a previous article the same writer attacked the reactionary and Tsarist policy of the Quai cTOrsay. The Temps, on the other hand, declares that the Entente Powers have no right to leave Livonia, Esthonia, Lithuania, and Poland to suffer the same fate as Russia. M..Herve, in the Victoire, makes the suggestion that intervention in Russia should be entrusted to an American army.Socialists and the Parliamentary Army Commission. The nine Socialist Members of the Parliamentary Army Commission, including Messieurs Albert Thomas, Pierre Laval, and Renandel, have sent in their resignations on the score that the President, M. Renoult, has refused to call upon M. Clemeiiceau to furnish explanations to the Commission with regard to the question of demobilisation. In a letter to M. Renoult they declare that if the right of the Commission to examination and control is abandoned, it may be said that the Parliamentary regime no longer exists and that the affairs of the nation are to be regulated by a spirit of dictatorship which will menace the liberties of the country. The problem of demobilisation, they submit, touches not onPy the personal right of the soldier citizen but even the conception of pieace which affects the economic reconstruction of the country and the policy of military intervention and occupation which may follow the armistice. They therefore cannot accept the Government^ policy of silence. M. Sembat uses the occasion to compare the French and British methods of demobilisation in favour of the latter. M. Renoult has written a reply to this letter in which he states that the Commission has always appreciated the great importance of the problem of demobilisation in which all the colleagues of the Commission are equally interested and appeals to the Socialist members to rescind (heir decision. On December 27th Lord Derby reported that the resignation had been withdrawn on the grounds that general demobi-lisation will be accelerated and that a military expedition to Russia is not contemplated.Spanish Relations. On his arrival in Paris, Count Romano ties granted several interviews to members of the French Press, in which he laid stress on the necessity of establishing cordial relations between Prance and Spain and of putting an end to the lattePs isolation. The Press advocates a rapprochement with Spain and looks to Count Romanones to effect this, but takes the opportunity to allude to Germanophil activities in that country and in Morocco, aud to insist on the parahiouncy of French interests on the North African coast.The Sarre Valley. M. Engeraud, the Progressionist Deputy, in a leading article in the Petit Parisien, estimates that the destruction by the Germans of French mines has reduced the French coal production by a half, and that, unless France regains possession of the valley of the Sarre, which belonged to her from 16-18 to 1815, she will be obliged to obtain her coal supply from Germany, which would place her under the latters economic control.Economic Control. The French Minister of Commerce has communicated a Memorandum to Lord Reading, requesting a modification of the economic control of the Administrative International Organisation and a gradual reversion to normal economic  conditions.    While the benefits of co-operation and the clanger of any7185--n e
sudden abolition of control, especially from undue pressure by private interests, are fully realised, the Memorandum points out that the economic condition of France is such as to demand particular consideration on the part of the Allies. France has especially7 suffered from the German occupation, and must be certain of obtaining at once the quantities of goods necessary for her reconstitution and her national existence, and of receiving them during the post-bellum period at prices identical with those in force among the other Allies. The French Government therefore proposes to direct the Inter-Allied Councils and Programme Committees to prepare the measures which must be taken, in co-ordination with the Allied Governments, for the gradual abandonment of the existing system of control.ITALY.Propaganda. Sir If. Rumbold has been warned, though he treats the whole subject with reserve, against the activities of the Dante Alighieri Society, which is said to be in close touch with the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. This Society is preparing to apply Mr. Wilson&apos;s doctrine of self-determination to Savoy in order to compel France and Great Britain to support Italian claims in Jugo-Slavia. It is also stated that the Society is supported by the Cardinal Secretary of State and the Papal Nuncio at Munich in promoting the claims of the Sinn Feiners, and that the Pope, whose relations with the Irish Episcopate are stronger than ever, and who is working in conjunction with the Quirinal Government, has a solution of the Irish question under consideration.Jugo-Slav Relations. Lord Derby has been informed through the French Government that the Italians are trying to exert pressure on the Jugo-Slavs by hampering the supply7 of food to the Jugo-Slavs in the Adriatic regions.The Italian Government, according to a statement made by Signor Crespi on December 2.1st, is prepared to allow the Jugo-Slavs to man such Austrian ships as they can bring into service more rapidly7 than the other Allies (vide page 3).JAPAN.Claims in the Far East. Attention is drawn to a Memorandum (G.T. 6507) Avhich deals, inter alia, with Japanese aspirations with regard to China and the Pacific Islands.LIBERIA.The United States. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Monrovia states that there exists a feeling of resentment among the public in that the scheme of the United States Government (vide Report No. 96, page 6) is being kept secret. There is a widespread antagonism to the possible control of the administration by7 the United States, which may eventually lead to the formation of a Protectorate. It is understood that the Liberian Government has accepted the conditions of the loan.,French Relations. The President of the Republic informed His Majesty&apos;&amp; representative that considerable apprehension exists with regard to French designs in Liberia. The French are using pressure to obtain control of the German Wireless station at Monrovia.PORTUGAL.Internal Situation. According to the Matin, Senhor Costa declares that 5,000&apos; Portuguese citizens, many of them prominent in public affairs, who are opposed to the present regime, have lingered for many months in Portuguese jails.   Many soldiers
rvlio have fought in France and Africa have been incarcerated. Senhor Costa enquires whether, in view of these facts, which represent only a part of the horrors from which Portugal is suffering, an enlightened public opinion can be astonished if unexpected acts of violence occur in Portugal. The Portuguese Minister in Paris has replied to these accusations. He states that the Government only used its right of self-defence after the failure of two revolutionary attempts and a Bolshevist movement. When Senhor Costa was in power his Government committed acts which were reproved both in Portugal and abroad. The late President and his Government were deeply loyal to the Allies and to Portugal&apos;s traditional policy.Sir L. Carnegie reports that on December 21th a coup d&apos;etal was attempted under the auspices of officers who held marked monarchist sympathies aud who demanded a purely military government. The movement collapsed in face of the firm attitude of the Government. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Sir L. Carnegie that the Military Juntas will be treated in a spirit of conciliation though no changes are to be made until after Congress has met on January Sth.On December 31st, however, the situation was again reported to be critical. Part of the army has demanded the formation of a military Government before Congress meets. Oporto is the centre of this movement. The attitude of the garrison at Lisbon is uncertain. The Government has issued a statement reaffirming its decision to leave the settlement of the political problem to Parliament. The Monarchist Press, though advocating the establishment of a military Government, denies that there exists any connection between the military movement and the Monarchist party.Referring to the above movement Count Romanones informed Sir A. Hardinge (Madrid) that he was convinced that the murder of Senhor Paes was the work of Senhor Costa&apos;s followers. He proposed that, if Great Britain thought it necessary to intervene in the event of Portugal drifting into anarchy, Spain should co-operate on the lines of the joint intervention of 1S16.SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.The Untied Ministry. On December 17th Sir 0. des Graz reported that the formation of the new United Ministry was being delayed on account of the resignation of M. Pashitch wdio had a difference of opinion with the Crown Prince of Serbia. The new ministry consisting of nine Serbian and eight Jugo-Slav members was eventually sworn in on December rfGth. M. Westitoh is President of the Council, and Dr. Korosets,1 Vice-President. Dr. Trumbic2 is Minister for Foreign Affairs. Sir C. des Graz has been informed that M. Pashitch will be the first delegate to the Peace Conference.Montenegro. On December 19th the Crown Prince of Serbia received the Montenegrin deputation which presented him with the declaration of the great Montenegrin Skuptchina proclaiming the union of Montenegro and Serbia. The Montenegrin Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in Paris has asked Lord Derby for the despatch of British in addition to French troops to Montenegro. The French, he declared, favoured Serbian encroachments. He asserted that the declaration of union with Serbia was the work of an illegal assembly acting under the auspices of a foreign State which had long coveted Montenegro.In the event of Allied troops being sent to Montenegro, the King, who believes in the loyalty of his subjects, has signified his wish to accompany them.On December 26th the Italian Minister informed Sir G. Grahame (Paris) that Cettinjehad been occupied by Italian troops who were accompanied by the Government set up at Podgoritza. He stated that in his opinion the King would be assassinated if he returned.The Montenegrin Government at Paris has received the following communication from the Serbian Charge d&apos;Affaires : &quot; By order of Royal Government I have the honour to inform Ministry of Foreign Affairs that diplomatic functions of representatives of the Serbian Government must be regarded as having ceased seeing that on 4th instant union of Montenegro with Serbia was effected.&quot;1 Late President of the National Council of Zagreb (Agram). 2 Late President of the Jugo-Slav Committee.
sThe Government has vigorously protested. Sir G. Grahame thinks that the French Government may he privy to the Serbian coup cVetat, and endorses the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government which proposes that a joint French and British warning should be delivered to the Serbian Government to leave the Montenegrin question to be decided at the Peace Conference.UNITED STATES.&apos; Anglo-American Relations. A telegram has been received to the effect that a strong anti-British movement, which is believed to be general throughout the United States, has been started by the Irish Catholics in San Francisco. It is stated that the Irish party is very influential in politics, and has the support of the whole Catholic Church. Hearst, whose papers carry considerable weight among the labouring-classes, is aiding the anti-British campaign. The question of the freedom of the seas and the alleged excessive rates charged for the transportation of American troops in British ships is being used to stir up ill-feeling. Even the better-class papers show signs of changing their attitude.Mr. Barclay has been informed that every possible assistance will be given in the repatriation of American troops. Arrangements have been made for the provision of suflicieut tonnage to carry 32,000 American troops from the United Kingdom and Brest between December 28th and January 10th.Voluntary Enlistment. Mr. Barclay reports that a Bill has been introduced into Congress providing for the resumption of voluntary enlistment in the Army. The Secretary for War points out that this course is necessary because, owing to casualties and wastage, the regular army will be inadequate for the ordinary purposes of peace when the soldiers, who enlisted for the period of the war only, have been demobilised.Jewish Commonwealth. The American-Jewish CongTess at Philadelphia passed a resolution on December 17th affirming its desire for the establishment of a Jewish Commonwealth under the Trusteeship of Great Britain who would act on behalf of such a League of Nations as may hereafter be formed.International Labour Conference. Mr. Gompers informed His Majesty&apos;s repre-sentative at Washington that he had been requested by various Labour Conventions to issue invitations to an International Labour Conference and that the President not only did not object to this but thought that the presence of Mr. Gompers in Paris woidd be of real service. Mr. Gompers is, however, unwilling to proceed to Paris without valid reasons for doing so. He also pointed out that it had been decided that the Conference should be held in a neutral country. Mr. Gompers wishes to know the views of the British Government before issuing the invitations.ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.German Austria. According to a German Wireless report it is proposed to hold the elections for the Constituent Assembly on February ICth.Lord Derby reports that M. Crozier, the former French Ambassador at Vienna, is strongly of the opinion that German Austria should not be annexed to Germany. M. Gauvain writes to the same effect in the Journal cles Debate.Sir H. Rumbold learns that Dr. Renner, the German Austrian Prime Minister, has sent Dr. Adler, who is a well-known financier, to Berne with the object of drawing the attention of the French authorities to the fact that French holders of Austrian
GERMAN Y.Political Situation. Attention is drawn to a Memorandum (G.T. 6551) on the Prospects of Order and an Ordered Government in Berlin. All opinion which really counts, namely, that represented by the votes of the majority and the armed force of the soldiers, is in favour of a general German Constituent Assembly and the retention of ultimate authority and provisional representation of the nation by the AVorkmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council of all Germany until the Assembly is elected. The soldiers adhere to the principle of a republican constitution and federalism the formation of an Unitarian republic being iavoured by Saxony alone. The elections for the Con-stituent Assemblies of separate States have already begun. In Mecklenburg a large Radical (non-Socialist) majority has been returned. In Anhalt Dessau the Moderate Socialists are in the majority. The two chief obstacles to stable government are the Spartacus group, which, though not in itself formidable, is the rallying-point for dis-contented and disorderly elements, and, more important, the serious economic situation.Sir H. Rumbold, on the other hand, is in possession of information to a contrary effect. His informant declares that the present Government cannot last long, and contrasts the pusillanimity of Ebert and Scheidemann with the vigorous courage of Liebknecht, who is not afraid to realise his aims by force. He therefore thinks that Bolshevism in the great cities is by no means impossible. Much depends on the speedy convocation, of the - Assembly, the suppression of the Councils, and, finally, upon the attitude of the Entente Powers, who should demand these measures. He foresees the danger of the Independent Socialists and the Spartacus group trying to dissolve the Assembly by force if it contains a bourgeois majority. The whole of Germany, it is stated, including the aristocratic and officer class, is opposed to the restoration of the Hohenzollerns, though in some quarters it is hoped that the time will come when some minor German prince may be elected Emperor.7185-1!&apos; cbonds stand to lose a considerable sum of money. The States of the former Dual Monarchy have repudiated their liabilities which German Austria cannot meet by herself. Dr. Adler has been instructed accordingly to ask the French to save German Austria from bankruptcy.Hungary. Sir H. Rumbold learns that Count Karolyi is endeavouring to open negotiations with Bohemia and German Austria with regard to an economic agreement.According to a German Wireless report dated December 2fth, the Moderate Party of the Budapest Workmen&apos;s Council was victorious by 315 to 12 votes on the question of the Radical programme of Reform which was thereby rejected. The co-operation of the Social Democratic Party with the middle-class party and the Government is therefore said to be assured.Corinthia.-A German Wireless report states that the German Burgomaster of Forlach and other citizens have been taken as hostages by the Jugo-Slav troops.Bohemia.--German Wireless reports have been very busy with regard to Czech encroachments On December 19th it was stated that the Czechs were conscripting the 1894-1897 classes among the inhabitants of Zuaim (Moravia). On December 18th they occupied Troppau (Austrian Silesia). The policy of the Czech Government is condemned as one of ruthless imperialism. It is asserted that the Czechs are already plundering Upper Hungary and, aided by the French, inteud to occupy portions of Saxony and a large part of Prussian Silesia.Supplies.- The President of the Swiss Republic has been informed by an Inter-national Red Cross delegate that the bread ration in Vienna consists of 125 grammes per head and that there is little else to eat except beetroot and cabbages. The President stated that sufficient coal had been obtained from Bohemia to last for the next three months. Sir H. Rumbold reported on December 24th that American delegates were proceeding to Vienna to inspect the food situation. Arrangements have been made to despatch a considerable amount of foodstuffs to Vienna and German Austria from Italy and Switzerland. Lichtenstein and those parts of the Tyrol not occupied by Italian troops are included in the arrangements of the Inter-Allied Commission.
The German Wireless has a good deal to say about the resignation of the Minority Socialists, Herren Iiaase, Dittmaun, and Earth, the general tone being that Herr Ebert&apos;s Government has been left in a more stable and solid position to deal with the problems of peace and reconstruction. The vacancies in the Government have been tilled by Herren Noske, Loebe and Wissall, who are all Majority Socialists.The Coastal Provinces. According to a statement made by Admiral Goette (reported in G.T. 6519) the old Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, together with a part of Prussia extending to Emden, the East Frisian Islands, Heligoland and Wilhehnshaven has been constituted into a Republic under the Presidency of Ivuhnt and aWorkmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council of 21 members. Naval officers have practically no authority. A similar Republic has been formed at Hamburg. There is little intercourse between these Republics and the Central Government at Berlin.Propaganda. Lord Kilmariiock learns that the German Socialists are about to begin violent propaganda with the object of placing the responsibility for the war on the &quot; Imperialistic &quot; Governments of Great Britain and France. This information is borne out by the numerous articles which have appeared in the German Wireless reports.Supplies. According to the Swiss Minister at Berlin there is a sufficient quantity of food in the German capital to last until February 7th on the present rationing system.neutral group.THE BALTIC PROVINCES.Esthonia. According to a telegram received from Lord Kilmarnock on December 21st the Esthonian delegates at Copenhagen state that a Bolshevist rising at Reval was suppressed on December 17th. The Esthonian Government does not fear the recurrence of disorders in the city itself. They declare, however, that the situation is very serious and that nothing can prevent a Bolshevist victory save the despatch of Entente troops. If they could gain a two months&apos; respite the Esthonians Avoxdd be able to hold their own. On December 24th it Avas reported that Dorpat had fallen and that the retreating Germans were continuing to assist the Bolshevists by destroying communications. The delegates stated that General von Cathen, commanding the Riga district, Avas negotiating with the Bolshevists. The Esthonian National Council implores His Majesty&apos;s Government to occupy aud protect the territory of Esthonia and to take command of the Esthonian Army.The Treasury is being urged to assent to small advances of money being made to the Esthonian and Lettish delegates, and the French Government, is being requested to co-operate.According to the latest Russian Wireless reports (December 20th and 31st) Bolshevist troops have reached Loxa (on the coast 40 miles East of Reval), Rejun (in the Pernau region between Reval and Riga). Remotzkoe (about 50 miles N.W. of Riga), aud Romershof (45 miles S.W. of Riga).A Russian Wireless report of December ,23rd states that the Secretariat of the Esthonian Soviet of the Avorkmen&apos;s community has declared the nationalisation of all industries and the abolition of religious instruction in schools.BOLIVIA.Demand for a Port. Mr. Haggard (La Paz) reports that a new Ministry has been formed with the object of obtaining a port in accordance with the general desire of the nation. Mr. Haggard, however, does not think that the new Government will have a long life.   Bolivian policy aims at gaining this end through a joint
agreement with Chile and Peru rather than through a rapprochement with one of the two Governments. But the Bolivian Government is to a great extent influenced by the apparent attitude of Chile in favour of giving Bolivia a port at Arica.DENMARK.Bolshevism. Lord Kilmarnock has been informed by the Danish Government that permission to leave and enter Denmark will no longer be given to Bolshevist agents, who are deprived of diplomatic privileges.Trade. Lord Kilmarnock reports that American hanks are making enquiries as to whether a market can be found in Denmark for a large quantity of cotton and woollen goods. One firm has already received a large consignment of such goods. In view of this the British Commercial Attache at Copenhagen suggests that licences for the export from the United Kingdom of similar commodities to Denmark and the rest of Scandinavia should be granted as freely as possible.FINLAND.Political Situation. According to a German Wireless report dated December 2Sth, General Mannerheim arrived at Helsingfors on December 25th, where he was received by the State Council and the civic and military authorities. At a subsequent meeting of the State Council it was resolved to dissolve the present Diet. The elections will take place at the beginning of March and the new Diet will meet on April 1st. The text of General ManuerheinPs declaration has been received. He calls on the Finnish people to stand united in maintaining the nation&apos;s independence aud liberty. In this way alone will the future Government he able to settle internal questions and win recognition from the Powers. He states that the latter have permitted the importation of 120,000 tons of cereals into Finland.His Majesty&apos;s representative at Helsingfors has informed General Mannerheim of the general policy of the British Government with regard to Finland, which is to defer the question of Finland&apos;s future to the Peace Conference.German Officers. Mr. Clive learns that there are still some eight German officers in the Finnish Army, in addition to several officers in plain clothes who remain at Helsingfors.MEXICO.Political Situation. His Majestys representative in Mexico reports that there is evidence of an increase in revolutionary activity, several trains having been wrecked, probably by agents ofjDiaz. Discontent against the Government and its corrupt dealings is frequently expressed. Carranza, whose foreign policy is entirely influenced by his enmity towards the United States, has stated that after the failure of his initial attempt to arrive at an understanding with the British Government better relations between the two countries can only be attained through a petition from the British Government. Mr. Cummings, however, thinks it possible that Carranza&apos;s hostility towards the United States may cause him to turn to France or Great Britain. The United States Ambassador in Mexico is also of the opinion that Carranza will attempt to play off Great Britain against the United States, and has suggested to Plis Majesty&apos;s representative that the British Government should, urge President Wilson to take definite action with regard to Mexico. Force, he declared, was the only remedy. Mr. Cummings suggests that, in the event of His Majesty&apos;s Government being-prepared to sacrifice its right (established by the policy of the non-recognition, of Carranza&apos;s Government) to place responsibility for British losses on the United States, it should point out to President Wilson the delinquencies of the Mexican Government, and should propose to support a pro-Ally or pro^American party for the restoration of order.   Mr. Cummings thinks that such a course would either lead to reparation
from the hands of a new Government in Mexico, or would place the obligation upon President Wilson of taking steps beneficial to British interests. Thirdly, it might increase the responsibility of the United States for British losses.A statement has appeared in the Press to the effect that M. Pania, who has been appointed Mexican Minister to France, has been instructed to settle certain matters pending between the Mexican and British Governments.Banks. It is reported that the draft of a new banking law has been sent to Congress by Carranza according to which the existing concessions to foreign banks are to be cancelled. If this Bill becomes law, the managers of the Canadian Bank of Commerce and of the Bank of Montreal, which are the only two important foreign banks left, have been instructed to close their banks and leave Mexico.NETHERLANDS.Limbarg and the Scheldt. In a conversation with His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on December 14th, M. van Swinderen raised the question of the passage of German troops through Limburg. He complained bitterly of the tone adopted hy the French and Belgian Press in connection with this incident and of the threat that Holland should be made to cede territory. He gave a fresh assurance that the Germans had been disarmed and stated that, apart from the difficulty of maintaining 60,000 men in Holland, it, was illogical to suggest that they should have been interned when the Netherlands Government had already received instructions from the Allies to the effect that German subjects interned in Holland might be allowed to return to Germany (vide Report No. 95, page 2).The Netherlands Minister concluded by saying that the Government was not likely to raise any technical objections to the transport of supplies via the Scheldt to the army of occupation in Germany.Meanwhile the French Government has received a Note from the Belgian Minister in Paris in which it. is proposed to supply the Allied troops quartered in German territory to the East of Limburg over lines of communication crossing Netherlands territory and to occupy temporarily Dutch Limburg with French and Belgian troops.With regard to the first point the British Government has already sent a similar Note to the Netherlands Government (vide Report No. 99, page 9), and the War Office further proposes to demobilise troops.via the Scheldt. But both the French Govern-ment and His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agree that the occupation of Limburg is undesirable. Mr. Robertson (The Hague) reported on December .24th that an agitation Avas being raised by M. vliegen and. the Dutch Socialists against [Belgian annexation of Limburg. Mr. Robertson considers that any&apos; such action might throw Holland into the arms of Germany. He has been informed that the final solution of the Limburg and Scheldt questions must be left to the Peace Conference.The Kaiser. Following upon the Dutch Prime MinisteFs statement in the Second Chamber (vide Report No. 99, page 10), M. van Swinderen in the above-mentioned conversation with Mr. Balfour again asserted that the Netherlands Govern-ment had no previous knowledge of the KaiseFs arrival, and that Count Bentinck had only been induced to place his chateau at the KaiseFs disposal under strong pressure from the Government. He stated that, Avhiie Holland did not feel able to refuse a temporary asylum to the Kaiser, the Government would not decline to discuss with the other PoAvers the questions that might be raised, with regard to his possible extradition.In reference to the demand which sprang up during the election for the punishment of the Kaiser. M. Colijn stated that the Dutch held strictly to the right of asylum. He Avarned the PoAvers against raising the rights of asylum as a legal question, but suggested that a Commission should be appointed, with which the Dutch could be associated, to decide that no such question did arise. The Dutch, he thought, avouIcI then act, not because they were forced to do so by superior powers, but in co-operation Avith superior poAvers,.recognising the justice of the claim that the Kaiser shoidd be given up.Bolshevism. The Netherlands GoArernment has signified its desire to come to some agreement Avith the British Government with regard to the control of Bolshevism.&apos; The assistance of a British official for this purpose avouIcI Ave welcomed.
Trade -There is evidence ol German trade activity in Holland. On December 27th Mr. Robertson reported that Horr von Gwinner, of the Deutsche Bank, aud Herr Heckscher, of the Hamburg-America Line, were at The Hague, in addition to a large number of commercial travellers, who seemed to have considerable funds at their disposal. Mr. Robertson thinks that Dutch banks and firms, and also the Netherlands Government, will consult their own interests in giving them every assistance, and that Holland will become the jumping-olf place for German trade. From another source it is learnt that restrictions on export from Germany to Holland have been removed, that German manufacturers are issuing a mass of trade circulars, and that they are even prepared to sell their goods at a loss in order to capture the Dutch market.Mr. Robertson also reports that Dr. Regendang, a German in the employ of the Austrian Credit Anhalt, is trying to arrange a loan in the United States on behalf of the Austrian Government.NORWAY.Bolshevism. Mr. Ovey reported on December 10th that the attitude of the military authorities and of the Government towards the Bolshevists had become more confident. The Socialists have failed to carry out their threat to initiate a three days&apos; strike (vide Report No. 99, page 10).The French Minister has urged the Norwegian Government to confiscate any funds which stand to the credit of the Bolshevists in the Banks.SPAIN.. Political Situation. In a Despatch, dated December 6th, Sir A. Hardinge supplements the information given in Report No. 99, page 10. The new Ministers, a list of whom has appeared in The Times, are all Romanonist Liberals. Sen or Alba and the Marques de Alhucemas, who appear to be acting in close concert, though they refused to take office under Count Romanones, have declared that they are disposed&quot; to support his Government from without. Senor Alba, however, refuses to support a policy of &quot; unconditional surrender &quot; with regard to the Catalan question,, which &quot;Sehor Cambo, the Regionalist leader, professes to regard as indispensable. Sir A. Hardinge believes that the two Conservative leaders, Senor Dato and Sehor Maura, have decided to support the Government, especially in rectifying the serious economic situation.With regard to the question of Catalan autonomy, Sir A. Hardinge points out that the Catalan dialect has already been raised to the dignity of a literary and official language. In addition to this, the Extremists have rejected the representation of the Central Government of Barcelona as a link between the local Parliament and Councils and Madrid, and- propose the abolition of all appeals from Catalan Courts to the Supreme Tribunal in the Capital. As a result of this uncompromising attitude there has been a reaction against &quot; Catalan ism &quot; in ether parts of Spain, and the local Councils of the old Kingdom of Aragoa and of the provinces constituting Old Castile and Leon are holding meetings in favour of a process of decentralisation.Count Romanones, who is willing to make large concessions to the Catalans, is strongly opposed to these excessive demands which endanger national unity.On December 10th the Prime Minister made a declaration in Parliament which, subject to certain reservations as to the national interests and sovereign rights, was distinctly favourable to Catalan aspirations. On the 11th Sehor Maura delivered a speech which, though somewhat evasive, was received by all the &quot;Deputies, with the exception of the advanced parties of the Left, with great enthusiasm. There was a general impression that the Conservative Party was prepared to lend its aid to the solution of the Catalan problem, and that a road had at least been opened for a discussion of its practical aspects. On the 12th, however, Sehor Cambo declared that Senor Maura&apos;s speech with its patriotic allusion to an united Spain, and the applause which had greeted it, meant the rejection by the Monarchical Party leaders and the majority of the Chamber of Deputies of all concessions to Catalan aspirations. Therefore the Regionalist Party quitted the House followed by the two Catalan Reptdjlican Deputies, who stated that their Catalan countrymen would now know that their only salvation lay in a Federal Republic.   Sir A. Hardinge doubts Sehor Cambo&apos;s71S5-it o
sincerity, and thinks that he endeavoured to intimidate the Monarchical parties into unconditional surrender by throwing himself into the arms of the Republicans. The prospects oi&apos; Home Hide by agreement have probably been retarded it&apos; not wrecked by his action.Relations with the Allies. On December 27th Count Uomanones had an interview   with Sir A. Hardinge, during which lie stated that he was satisfied with his reception in Paris. With regard to the six German ships seized by Spain to replace &quot;in part the tonnage destroyed by Germany, he declared that the Spanish Government refused to give up its claim to them, though the Allies were at liberty to take possession of any other enemy vessels lying in Spanish ports.Dealing with the Moroccan question the Minister of Slate considered that there was a party in Prance which wished to deprive Spain of her position in Morocco, and to make the war the occasion fV annulling the Act of Algeciras. He suggested that Great Britain might reassume her old role as intermediary between France and Spain. ^ .In a subsequent conversation the United States Ambassador agreed with Sir A. Hardinge, that the Allied Governments should not press for the surrender of the six German ships, lest such pressure should lead to Count Roma nones&apos; resignation.SWEDEN.Bolshevism. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Mr. Clive that the Swedish Government is prepared to allow Bolshevists from England to be sent back to Russia in company with those who are to be deported from Sweden. The Finnish Government, however, has made their transit through Finland conditional upon the release of certain Finnish subjects who have been imprisoned in Russia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs suggests that the British Government could bring economic pressure to bear upon the Finnish Government in order to make it revoke this decision.Aland Islands. In an interview with His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on December loth, the Swedish Minister discussed the future of the Aland Islands. He stated that the islands were within modern gunshot range of Stockholm, and that they were inhabited by Swedes who ardently desired reunion with Sweden. He suggested that, the subject might be dealt with by the Powers &quot;which were parties to the Treaty of 1S5G or by the Peace Conference. The only obstacle was the attitude of General Mannerheim, who held that the cession of the islands to Sweden would weaken the Swedish element in Finland which was more advanced than the larger Finnish population.A German Wireless message of December 23rd states that, according to the Svenska Tidningen, the Swedish Government has handed a Note to the Finnish Government demanding that a plebiscite should be taken in the Aland Islands. It is thought, the message adds, that the plebiscite null be almost unanimous in favour of Sweden. Attention is drawn to a Memorandum (P. 73) which deals with the Aland question in its historical, racial, and strategic aspects.SWITZERLAND.Bolshevism. Sir 1I. Rumbold learns that in pursuance of its policy of I fighting Bolshevism by every means in its power, the Federal Government is recalling the Swiss Minister from Petrograd. All Bolshevists have been expelled from Lausanne and similar steps will be taken at Berne and Zurich.The President subsequently stated that the Swiss Minister had been prevented from leaving Russia&apos; by the Bolshevist Government. The latter has in ado several attempts to resume relations with Switzerland.TilE VATICAN.President Wilson. Count: do Salis, has been informed by the Cardinal Secretary of State that President Wilson has decided to pay an official visit to the Pope.

The conclusion is come to that the enemy would be able to pay from 50 to 75 per cent, of the probable reparation claim, but that a claim for the general costs of the war in addition to reparation could not be met even in part. The Committee appointed by the Imperial War-Cabinet has reported (P. 38) that the total cost of the war to the Allies (direct cost estimated at 2-1,000,000,0001.) is the measure of the indemnity which the enemy Powers should in justice pay. The Committee assumes that enemy Powers could provide l,2OO,O00,000L per annum as interest when normal conditions are restored, and does not consider that the fear of economic ill-effects to Allied countries is well founded. The Board of Trade in a comprehensive Memorandum (P. 33) dealt in detail with the same subjects. In a Paper dated December 25th, Lieutenant-Colonel Amery (G.T. 6573) has put forward proposals for guiding principles to be kept in view in order to protect British interests in this question.Lord Derby on December 1 Sth confirmed his report on the opinion of the French Government about representation at the Peace Conference (G.T. 0568).

His Majesty&apos;s Government will ask for recognition of the New Republic, and for a hearing for its representatives.Greece. The Government realises that armed occupation of territory in question will not have any useful effect upon the decision of territorial questions at the Peace Conference (Lord Cranville, December 20th).Italy.
