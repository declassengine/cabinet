WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.general.Bolshevism. An account, issued by the Home Secretary, of Bolshevist activities In European countries is given in an Appendix to this Report.It is learnt through a French source that the Bolshevist Council of War, realising that no serious military operations can be undertaken by the Allies before next spring, intends to use the intervening period in increasing munition supplies and carrying out a war of propaganda. It is understood that trained agitators will be sent to those provinces where Entente occupation is anticipated. Agitators are also being sent to the Russo-German frontier in order to spread propaganda among the Russian prisoners returning from Germany and Austria. A special section has been formed under the name of Hindus with the object of sending agents to India.Repatriation of Prisoners. (1) Germany. The camps at Daldorf, Meschecle, Stendal, Parchim, Lazeret, Bautzen and Worms have been evacuated. His Majesty&apos;s representative at The Hague reports that on December 29th it was estimated that 24,000 prisoners of war still remained in Germany. Of these 13,000 were expected to arrive in Holland before January 5th, 7,000 were being repatriated via the Baltic Ports, and the remainder were being concentrated at Wahn. The principal camps occupied at the beginning of the month were Cassel (3.000 prisoners), Langensalza (1,300), Soltau (1,500), Altengravow (900), Gottingen (600), and Gustrow (1,700).According to the latest figures given by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Prisoners of War, 6,965 officers, 134,285 other ranks, and 4,541 civilians have been repatriated since the signing of the Armistice.(2) Russian Prisoners. The Russian Minister at Stockholm requests the consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the establishment in Berlin of a Russian Committee to deal with prisoners of war. It is suggested that the Committee might select from the prisoners such men as were willing to work for the re-establishment of a normal state of affairs in Russia.Mr. Robertson learns that Russian officers are being handed over to the Bolshevists by the German authorities on the plea that, if they are not repatriated, they will die of starvation. The officers have asked to return to Russia via Vladivostock, as the Bolshevists are placing before them the alternative of accepting service in the Bolshevist army or being shot.allied  group.CHINA.North and South. Sir J. Jordan reported on January 7th that the prospects of a settlement appeared more hopeful. The Northern delegates were prepared to receive the Southern representatives at Nankin. The South, however, was still accusing the Northern Government of aggression in Fukien and Shensi, Avhile the North alleged that the Southern representatives were in Japanese pay.;france.The Socialist Party. On December 30th -M. Renaudel read a declaration in the Chamber on behalf of the Parliamentary Socialist group explaining the abstention of its members from voting the credits demanded by the Government.   He declared that
tlie policy of the Government was not based upon the development of Democracy. M. Pichon&apos;s speech with regard to intervention in Russia was equivocal and seemed to portend an eternal future of war. The policy of naval and land armaments was apparently to continue. The Socialist Deputy, M. Marcel Gachin, writes in Tlumanite that M. Clemenceaii and i\l. Pichon&apos;s conception of peace is in brutal contradiction to that of President Wilson. There is, he declares, no longer any unity of thought between the Allies.On December 31st M. clemenceau informed a delegation of the Confederation Generale du Travail that persons imprisoned for offences incurred during any recent strikes would be released. He also stated that he saw no objection to the meeting of the International Labour Conference.        1Italian Policy.  M. Gauvain, in the Journal des Debats, declares that since the armistice the polic3T of annexation as regards the East Adriatic Coast pursued by M. Sonnino has developed to such an extent that M. Bissolati could clearly no longer shoulder the responsibility of a policy of which he disapproved (vide also under &quot;Italy&quot;)-ITALY.French Relations. Sir R. Rodd has transmitted to Mr. Balfour a report from the British Military Attache who returned from a tour of the Istrian and Dalmatian coast at the beginning of December. The report states that Jugo-Slav representatives laid special stress on the friendliness of the French, and that some of them even declared that they would have welcomed a French occupation. The more anti-Italian they were, the stronger they expressed their French sympathies. The report goes on to say that the situation between the Italians and French could hardly be worse. Admiral Cagni declared that the French Commodore at Pola had gone so far as to declare himself the protector of the Jiigo-Slavs as opposed to the Italians. The Italian Commanders at Sebenico and Fiume made similar complaints to the effect that the French were encouraging Jugo-Slav extremists in order to bring discredit upon the Italians.In a despatch dated December 22nd Sir R. Rodd quotes numerous articles from the Italian Press consequent upon the King of Italy&apos;s visit to Paris. Though con-siderable satisfaction is expressed with the King&apos;s reception, the subject of Franco-Italian relations is treated with a certain reserve. There appears to be a general feeling that Italy is not being treated as an equal and that the principle of self-determination may be waived where French interests are concerned, but will be insisted upon where Italian interests are at stake.Signor BissolatVs Resignation. Attention is drawn to an interview granted by Signor Bissolati to the Berne correspondent of the Morning Post [Morning Post, January 6th). &quot; I have failed,&quot; said the ex-Minister, &quot;to move Baron Sonnino away from three clauses of the Secret Treaty of London: (1) the annexation of a large portion of Dalmatia from Lissarika to Cape Palanka ; (2) the permanent retention of the Dodekanese with its&quot; exclusively Greek population, and (3) the inclusion within Italian territory of the German population of the Northern Tyrol.&quot;PORTUGAL.Political Situation. Sir L. Carnegie reports that the Government and the Military Party reached an agreement on January 4th. The Ministry is being-reconstituted. Sir L. Carnegie considers that the crisis is terminated for the present.SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Italian Relations.  A report has been received from Sir R. Rodd stating that an Italian force consisting of cavalry and armoured cars came into open conflict with Serbian regular troops in the neighbourhood of Dernis and Knin (North-west of
Sebenico). Nine Serbians were captured and the Italians continued their inarch inland. Each side accuses the other of aggression. The Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs has urged on the Secretary of the National Council of Agram the necessity of exercising moderation with regard to this affair in accordance with the counsels of the French and British Ministers at Belgrade. There is, however, a feeling of doubt in Serbian circles as to whether similar counsel has been given to the Italian Government.Montenegro. The King of Montenegro has addressed a letter to the President of the French Republic protesting against the communication handed to the Monte-negrin Government at Paris by the Serbian Charge d&apos;Affaires (vide Report No. 100, page 7). He says : &quot; Thus appears in all its brutality the action of the Serbian Govern-ment towards its oldest and faithful ally .... I ask whether it is admissible, at our epoch, to treat with such cynical high-handedness an old Sovereign who has served for sixty years the interests of his country, and a poor, heroic, small people which has lost everything on account of its solidarity with the cause of Right .... I will wait in the persuasion that the French troops .... will neglect nothing to assure in my kingdom the maintenance of order, the respect for constitutional authorities, and the liberties of the Montenegrin people.&quot;Sir R. Rodd learns through the Italian Government that the situation in Montenegro is serious. The section of the population which is averse to union with Serbia is being terrorised by Serbian troops and a revolution is reported to have begun. It is added that the French are encouraging the Serbians to attack Italian troops which are being sent as reinforcements from Valona to Antivari. On the other hand. Sir C. des Graz reports that the protest signed at Cetthije on December 27th, by all the Prime Ministers of Montenegro, who held office between 1906 and 1916, against the anti-union meeting at Rome is considered by Serbia as evidence that the King has lost all hold on the country. The Serbian Government therefore fails to understand the reason for the proposed occupation of Montenegro by the Allies. In view of the fact that the Italian troops are to be in superior force to the other Allies, the Serbian Government fears an outbreak of hostilities between the Montenegrins and Italians.UNITED STATES.Naval Policy. Mr. Barclay reports that on December 31st the Secretary of the Navy made a statement before the House Naval Committee to the effect that, unless the A7ersailles Conference resulted in a general agreement to put an end to naval construction on the part of all nations, the United States must use all her energies to create the greatest navy in the world. He admitted that after the completion of the proposed programme, which covers the next three years, the Navy of the United States would still rank second to that of Great Britain. He asked the Committee to include in the Bill a clause giving to the President discretionary power to stop construction if an international agreement should render unnecessary the maintenance of competitive armaments.ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-H UNGARY.United Slates Mission. According to a French Wireless report (January 4th) an American Mission is being sent to Austria-Hungary for the purpose of studying political, social, and economic conditions in Austria and the surrounding States. The Mission, which is headed by Professor Coolidge of Harvard University, is to have its headquarters at Vienna with sub-agencies at Prague, Budapest, and Agram.Bohemia. A German Wireless report (January 4th) states that Pressburg (Pozsony) was occupied on January 1st by 4,000 Czech troops. The racial boundaries between Magyars, Slovaks, and German-Austrians meet at Pressburg.
It is reported through the same source that there is a feeling of uneasiness prevailing at Warsaw as to Czech intentions. The Polish Government has sent a delegation to Prague in order to come to an understanding with regard to the Czech policy of annexation.President Masaryk is reported to have come to an agreement with German Bohemia.Oarntola. According to a German report, there was a skirmish between Jugo-Slav troops anil the militia of Carniola between the River Draye and Klagenfurth. The local Diet of Klagenfurth has addressed a strong protest to the Lai bach National Government against the Jugo-Slav advance on Klagenfurt which is a purely German town.GERMANY.Political Situation. In the absence of official information from the European Chanceries, the following account of the political situation in Berlin is extracted from German Wireless and Press reports. After the resignation of the Minority Socialists from the Government, Herr Ebert thus expressed himself in an interview with representatives of the Press : &quot; With the addition of my two friends, Noske and Wiszell, Germany for the first time has a purely party Government.- . . . We are convinced that only a Government which has no controversies to overcome in its own camp can now see us through .... I consider that 1113&apos; main task lies in the preparation of the National Assembly, on which, for us, depend the three most important achievements : peace, freedom, and bread.&quot;On December 30th the conference of the Spartacus League resolved, on a motion by Liebknecht, to form a Spartacusbund or Communist Labour Party of Germany. It was also resolved not to take part in the elections for the National Assembly. A great sensation was caused by the appearance at the Conference of M. Raclek, the representative of the Russian Soviet Government.On January 5th the partisans of the Spartacus Group attempted to capture the telegraph office of the Wolff Bureau, together with other government and newspaper offices. The immediate cause of the revolt appears to have been the dismissal by the Government of Herr Eichhoru, the Police President of Berlin, under whose management the Police Presidency has been the centre of Bolshevist activity. This action resulted in a rapprochement between the Minority Socialists and the Spartacus Group. Street fighting continued during the 6th and 7th, and has apparently ended in favour of the Government, notwithstanding a report (in the German Wireless) that herr Ebert had resigned. The latest reports state that Herr Noske has been appointed Governor of Berlin, with orders to restore tranquillity with the aid of the loyal troops. It is also stated that the Minority Socialists have offered to act as intermediaries between the Spartacus Group and the Government.Similar disturbances are reported to have taken place at dusseldorf, Muhlheim, and Oberhausen. v .It is stated in an official Russian report that the unemployed in Berlin number 400,000.The Constitution. An announcement appears in the German Wireless report of January 2nd dealing with, proposals for the future German Constitution. A President is to be elected by the whole people by direct suffrage and, with regard to constitutional power, his position will be a compromise between that of the President of the United States and the King of England. Non-parliamentary members will be allowed in the Ministry. The Legislature is to consist of a Peopled House and a State House, the latter to consist of the Federal legislative bodies. The voting will be arranged so as to prevent Prussian preponderance.It is reported through the same source that the Governments of the South&apos; German States of Bavaria, Wiirttemburg, Baden and Hesse have resolved jointly to direct their efforts to the reconstitution of Germany as a federal State on the basis of constitutional representation and order.There is a movement on foot in favour of holding the National Assembly at some other town than Berlin. . Herr Eisner, the Bavarian Minister, advocates Weimar or Wurzburg.71S5 21- is
Russian Relations. According to a wireless report of January 4th, the German. Government has broken off relations with the Soviet Republic. This step is asserted to have been taken on account of M. Radek&apos;s (vide above) instructions to continue the war against, the Entente by means of propaganda-a policy winch conflicts with Germany&apos;s own interests.NEUTRAL GROUP.BALTIC PROVINCES.The Bolshevist Advance. According to a Russian Wireless report of January Gth, the Bolshevist army reached Charlottenhof (35 miles east of Reval on the Reval-Vesen-berg railway7) on January 4th.   Riga was captured on the same day.In a conversation with Lord Kilmarnock, M. de Scavenins stated that the Bolshevists were using Chinese troops, who were laying waste the country, against the Esthonians. He estimated that the number of Esthonians in the field did not exceed 500. He thought that, the policy7 of defending coast towns by warships was doomed to failure.Mr. Clive learns that the Esthonian delegation has opened a recruiting office at Stockholm. A similar measure has met with success in Finland. Lord Kilmarnock suggests that, a voluntary7 force might be raised in England.His Majesty&apos;s representative at Vladivostock has been informed that the Esthonian Provincial Council has received the unofficial recognition of the British Government. He has been requested to report if there are any Esthonians in Siberia who wish to return home in order to protect their country against the Bolshevist invasion. The Esthonian delegation at Stockholm has asked Mr. Clive whether the Esthonian force of 100 trained men at Murmansk may be allowed to return to Esthonia.A Russian Wireless report of January Gth states that at Riga the Lettish Soviet has ordered the arrest of all persons belonging to the bourgeois class. Private property has been abolished.DENMARK.Coal. Lord Kilmarnock learns that a supply of 50,000 tons of American coal per month has been offered to a Danish coal company at prices higher than those paid for British coal. From fear of coal famine the Danish Government may request the Company to effect this purchase.LUXEMBURG.Political Situation.-His Majesty7&apos;s representative at The Hague has received information with regard to the future policy of Luxemburg. Administrative inde-pendence is desired by7 all parties. The Catholics, who form about one-half of the population, are in favour of retaining the Grand Duchess on the throne, but wish to establish a customs and military union with Belgium. The Liberals desire a similar union, but under the auspices of the King of the Belgians. They would depose the Grand Duchess on account of her pro-German sympathies. The Socialists, who represent a small minority, advocate a Republic united with France. Other demands consist in the re-establishment of the currency, an indemnity from Germany, and an economic rapprochement with the Entente.The Minister of State for Luxemburg has sent a telegram to Mr. Balfour stating that the Government of the Grand Duchy intends to rescind the conventions existing between Luxemburg and the German Government relating to the customs union and railway control. The Government hopes that an economic agreement may be negotiated, and that the declarations made by the Great Powers with regard to small nations may be applied to Luxemburg.
NETHERLANDS.German Coal. An announcement lias appeared in the Press to the effect that Holland can reckon upon the importation of -10,000 tons of coal per month from Germany.PERU.Dispute with Chile. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Lima learns from a reliable source that 68,000 men have been mobilised in Chile, 50,000 of whom are ready for active service. He states that the systematic campaign, which is being carried out against Peruvian subjects in Chile with the knowledge of the Chilian Government, is increasing the difficulties which confront the Government of Peru.SPAIN.Austro-IIunc/arian Shippinr/.--The Spanish Government has addressed a Note to the Allied representatives at Madrid requesting their respective Governments to acknowledge the following fundamental principles with regard to Austro-Hungarian shipping in Spanish ports : (1) the right of compensation to Spain for the destruction of Spanish shipping ; (2) the retention by Spain of the seven ships which were seized before the Armistice as security for such compensation ; (3) the acquirement of the formal consent of trie German and Austrian Governments to the transfer of their shipping by Spain to a third party.SWEDEN.Aland Islands. -On December 31st an official communique was issued in the Press to the effect that an agreement was signed on December 30th between the Govern-ments of Sweden, Finland and Germany whereby the fortifications on the Aland Islands are to be demolished. [In 1856 Russia entered into an agreement with Great Britain and France by which the islands were not to be fortified. At the beginning of the present war, however, fortifications were built, though Sweden was at the same time assured that at the end of the Avar they would be razed. It is of interest to note that a Russian Wireless message condemns the demolition of the fortifications as arranged for by the new agreement.]German Coal. 72,390 tons of coal Avere exported from Germany to Sweden during the month of November.SWITZERLAND.Bolshevism,-Sir II. Rum bold reports that the Federal Government welcomes the co-operation of the British Government for the purpose of controlling Bolshevist activities. It is understood that, as in the case of Holland, a British official is to be appointed to work with the Swiss General Staff and the Department of Justice to this end.7 is&quot;) -21&apos;c
PEACE DISCUSSIONS.(N.B. Countries are arranged in alpliabetieal order under this heading.)General. His Majesty&apos;s Government has communicated to Allied Powers proposals to issue a warning to the effect that all anticipations, by the use of armed forces, of decisions expected to be come to at the Peace Conference are likely to prejudice the interests of those concerned (F.O. to Paris, Rome, and Washington, -January 2nd).Lord Gurzon has put forward a printed memorandum (P. 86), dated January 3rd, on the future of Cyprus, together with a joint note by the Naval and General Staffs on the strategic value of the island.The Admiralty on January 6th forwarded to the War Cabinet comprehensive proposals (G.T. 0607) for the destruction of enemy war vessels under the Peace Treaty.British Empire. Messrs. Arthur Henderson and Bowerman have addressed a letter to the Prime Minister enquiring, on behalf of &quot;the two National Committees representing the organised Labour movement,&quot; about the Governments policy in relation to Russia in connection with the. Peace Congress (G.T. 6604).Poland. On December 31st II. Rumbold reported that the Polish Government had decided to prevent violation of its territory by the passage of armed German soldiers from the Ukraine, and has asked the help of the Allied Powers for maintaining this policy in connection with the Armistice terms.Russia. See under British Empire.Serbia. It is proposed to address a protest to the Serbian Government against treatment of Montenegro, and attempts to anticipate thereby decisions of the Peace Conference (F.O., January 3rd).Turkey. Admiral Webb was instructed on January 1st to inform the Turkish Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government is not prepared to receive complaints against any action by the Allies affecting the Armistice terms until the Turkish Government has complied with the conditions, especially the surrender of Medina.&apos; Lord Gurzon has put forward a Memorandum (P. 85), dated January 2nd, on the future of Constantinople in connection with the Peace Congress.The naval Commander-in-Chief at Constantinople has put forward representations about the evacuation by sea of enemy troops from the Ukraine and Crimea under the armistice terms.   The question is being dealt with (F.O. to Lord Derby, January 7th).United States. Passports have been issued to Messrs. Gompers, J. 1). Alpine, F. Duffy, and W. Green as delegates to the Labour Conference (Mr. Barclay, January 6th).
APPENDIXtoWestern and General Report No. 101.The following extract is taken from a Report (g.T. 6603) circulated by the Home Secretary.The Progress of Bolshevism.  (1) Germany. The present position appears to be that the Spartacus Group lias succeeded in seizing the executive power in Berlin. It was already predominant in Hamburg, Kiel and Bremen, How far Bolshevist principles will radiate from Berlin no one can foretell, but it is difficult to believe that there will not be a reaction in South Germany and the Rhine Provinces, or that the German people as a whole, with their loAre of organisation and good order, will tamely submit to a Bolshevist regime on the Russian plan. At the present moment the prospect of having a stable Central Government to deal with in the Peace negotiations is not good.There is undoubted evidence to show that a systematic attempt to corrupt the morale of the Allied troops in occupation is being made. The German Legations in Copenhagen, The Hague, and Berne have been left untouched, both in personnel and in policy. They appear to think that their best chance of saving something from the wreck is to provoke Bolshevist disturbances in the Allied countries, and to this end they are printing leallets and employing returned prisoners as agents to go among the troops and incite them to depose their officers. Agents have also been taken on for service in England and France. They are especially active among the American troops of occupation,&quot; and it is perhaps significant that a considerable number of Americans are reported to have deserted into Germany. These may perhaps be merely men who are determined to escape from military discipline at all hazards and who have taken the line of least resistance in the hopes of securing a passage home to America.Besides the German source of propaganda, there is another stream flowing from Russia. These&apos; agents are for the most part returned prisoners of war, well supplied with&apos;money and passes and leallets on Bolshevist principles. The chief Bolshevist organ for propaganda is the Velt Revolution, published weekly in several languages under the auspices of the International Federation ; the editor of the edition in English is Philips Price, formerly correspondent of the Manchester Guardian.The munition works are still busy for eight hours a day, the hands working four hours and loafing four hours. For the last four hours they are paid 75 per cent, of their ordinary wage. The general impression in Berlin is that the return of the troops will at first strengthen the forces of order, but that if they remain in Berlin they will become infected with Bolshevism ; at present they show no tendencies in that direction.(2) Denmark. The attempt of the Syndicalists to bring about a general strike on November 13th having failed, the Social Democratic Party has issued a programme of reforms, and has, through its organ The Social Democrat, called upon the working classes to remain orderly. There is no immediate danger of a Bolshevist disturbance in that country.(3) Switzerland.- Revolutionary deserters in Zurich have already organised a Spartacus Group, and are in communication with Baase and Liebknecht. The German Consul has been instructed to give passes to those who are willing to go to Berlin to serve under Haase.The Government enquiry into the recent disturbances has resulted in the deter-mination to expel 18 Bolshevists and 15 Italian anarchists.A number of Swiss Socialists are reported to believe that there is already disorder in England. Generally speaking, they are not in favour of violence, believing that propaganda among the peasants and workmen will be more effective.
(-1) France. Bolshevism does not appear to be making much progress in Franco, in spite of the fact that Mosimann, chief of the Berne Police, a Germanopliile, is believed to lie issuing false Swiss papers to agents working for the Central Powers. An Italian deserter named Adolfo Sismondo stated that while in Paris a few weeks ago he attended the Bolshevist meeting at the Hotel Suisse, 5, Hue de la liuchette, convened for deciding on the propitious moment for starting revolution in France and Italy. The meeting was attended by 10 revolutionaries, including Charbrieres, tin-proprietor of the Hotel Suisse, and Morgan, the Italian Socialist Deputy, who visited England a few months ago. There was a difference of opinion as to whether the move should be made on the signature of the armistice or after the signature of peace, and the meeting showed that there was distrust between the revolutionaries themselves.(5) Belgium. The morale of the Belgian population in the British Army areas continues to be good. Feeling runs very high against those who trafficked with the enemy during the occupation. There is a very strong feeling against profiteering and the high price of food.(6) Spain. The Government proposes to send the Russian and Levantine Bolshevists, now in Barcelona, to Odessa and Constantinople. Since they have ceased to receive pay from the German Secret Service these men are becoming desperate. In ordinary times they would simply be put across the nearest frontier, but this, of course, is impossible at present.The unrest in Spain is crystallising into the Separatist Catalan Movement, and many well-informed Spaniards think that the Crown is not at present in any real danger, though there will be sporadic disorders all over the country. The Army and Civil Guard are believed at present to be faithful.A spurious anarchist body, now calling itself &quot;La Ligue Nationalists Catalana,&quot; has reappeared in Paris. It was formed 1.5 years ago under the name of &quot;La Ligue Catalana,&quot; and carried on a noisy agitation in favour of Ferrer. During the war it was believed to be defunct, but it has now become active again with a view to the Peace Conference, where it hopes to obtain President Wilsou&apos;s support as representing an oppressed nationality like the Poles and the Irish.(7) Italy. The speedj7 and friendly settlement of the metal workers&apos; strike at Milan has relieved the tension in Northern Italy, and for the. moment Bolshevism is making no progress. The worst feature is the bad management of the demobilisation, especially in regard to returned prisoners of war, who are said to be wandering about, sleeping out and stealing or begging their food.Interest attaches to an interview given to the Warsaw Correspondent of the Associated Press by M. Paderewski (published in The Times of January 9th). M. Paderewski declared that Bolshevism must be destroyed and drew attention to PolancTs role as a barrier State against BolsheA-ist encroachments.
