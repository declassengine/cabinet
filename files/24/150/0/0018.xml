WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Relaxation of Trade Restrictions. According to Sir C. des Graz (March 22nd) the commercial blockade of the Adriatic has been raised, and trade has also been sanctioned between Jugo-Slavia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Albania and Montenegro, and all neutral and allied countries, in respect of all articles save those on a special prohibited list.Bolshevism. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Ekaterinburg reports (March 20th) that his report on Bolshevism is now completed, and has forwprded to Sir C. Elliot (Vladivostock) the statements of witnesses, together with photographs and other documentary evidence, of atrocities committed by Bolsheviks.Food Belief. Lord Beading is informed (March -Oth) that the United States Shipping Board has been asked to supply a further 1,800,000 tons deadweight of shipping for European relief, which it is unable to comply with, and has enquired Avbat assistance Great Britain is giving.The following suggestions are put forward by the United States Shipping Board as an alternative to direct assistance : (1) A temporary reduction in tonnage allocated to Italy ;(2) Withdrawal of a proportion of British ships now in Italian service and their replacement by Italian-manned Austrian vessels ; (3) Similar action as regards France ;(4) Employment of German crews of German cargo ships running in relief service to United States.If the Supreme Council considers this proposal favourably, the Shipping Board is said to be prepared to provide a proportion of the officers and guards required in addition to the crews already arranged for passenger ships.Lord Reading is informed that the following American controlled tonnage is at present employed in the food relief service : Service of France, 173,000 tons ; Italy, 153,000 tons ; European relief (excluding Belgium), 750,000 tons.   All deadweight.Lord Reading has pointed out to the. United States Shipping Board that Great Britain has about 1,200,000 tons deadweight in the French service and about 1,300,000 tons deadweight in the Italian service. Furthermore, that Great Britain is still affording a considerable measure of assistance to the Belgian Relief Programme by means of SAvedish tonnage obtained by her under agreement Avith that country. (See also under &quot; United States.&quot;)ALLIED GROUP.BELGIUM.Coal Contract, Sir F. Villiers is informed (March 2.1st.) that the Belgian Govern-ment have sanctioned a three months&apos; contract Avith Swiss State Railways and coal merchants at Basle for supply of coal. He states that the question of coal export is considered vital, as there are accumulations of lower grades and it is necessary to get these away or the pits cannot be worked, which may result in industrial trouble.CHINA.Peace Conference at Shanghai. Lord Derby reported (March 20th) that the French Minister at Peking has been instructed to join His Majesty&apos;s representative in pressing for the dismissal of the Military Governor of Shensi and the disbandment of troops. The French Ambassador at Tokio, also, has been instructed to make joint representations on the subject to the Japanese Government.
CUBA.Labour Unrest. Mr. Cowan reported (March 20th) that the strike had terminated but considerable tension still existed owing to the dismissal by the Railway Company of employees who did not return to work promptly in accordance with the agreement made by their Union.FRANCE.Alsace-Lorraine. It is announced in the French Press that M. Jounart. has refused the post of High Commissioner for Alsace-Lorraine, and it has been offered to - M. Millerand, former Minister for War, who, Lord Derb\r is informed, has accepted it.Press Articles. An article in Action Francaise (March L9th) to which Lord Derby draws attention, deals with the necessity of speeding up the work of the Peace Conference as old habits are beginning to reassert themselves, and the necessity of mutual sacrifices is no longer imperative.Temps (March 20th) drew attention to the danger of delay in settling the political status of peoples of the Levant. The article states that the Allies have proclaimed great principles without defining their limits, and have omitted to make it clear that the right of people to dispose of their own fate cannot be extended to peoples incapable of governing themselves.Figaro (March 23rd) insists on necessity of affording all possible support, to Poland and Rumania, owing to increased dangers on the Eastern front resulting from Count Karolyi&apos;s resignation. Hostilities may be renewed between Hungary and Rumania at any moment, and there was grave danger of the Bolshevik armies reaching the centre of Europe.Mission to Inspect Sugar Factories. Lord Derby gives reasons (March 21st) for advocating the postponement of the proposed British official mission to inspect machinery in sugar factories damaged hy the war.GREECE.Spanish Exports to Greece. The Foreign Office has informed Lord Granville that all control over exports from Spain to Greece can now be abolished (March 23rd).2Egean Islands. -The War Office have suggested that pressure should be brought to bear on the Greek Government, and that they should be told that preparations for the despatch of troops to the .^aegean Islands must cease forthwith (Foreign Office, March 22nd).ITALY.Parliamentary Session. The Political Intelligence Department has circulated a Memorandum (G.T. 7030) on the recent session of the Italian Parliament.Blockade of Adriatic Coast. Mr. Balfour reported (March 20th) that the Blockade Council has decided to ask the Supreme Economic Council to represent to the Supreme War Council that steps be taken to raise the Italian naval blockade. The Italian representative refused to associate himself with the resolution.JAPAN.Relaxation of Export Restrictions. Sir C. Greene reported (March 18th) that the Japanese Government favours the relaxation of export restrictions since adequate safeguards against assistance to the enemy are provided by legislation.Shipping Combine. Sir O. Greene reports (March. 20th) a proposal to amalgamate the principal unsubsidised shipping companies in order to relieve the existing depression, and it is stated that the Government is encouraging the combine, which will be purely Japanese at first, though, it is reported, American capital and co-operation are being invited.
SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Flume. According to Sir 0. des Graz (March 19th) a rumour that Fiume was to he given to Italy caused a painful impression and great anxiety at Lai bach and       C Agran, where black flags were flown as a sign of mourning.   Fiume, he states, is regarded as a commercial necessity for these countries and for the desired develop-ment of commercial relations with Great Britain.Serbia, The Swiss Press publishes a communique (March 20th) stating that the Federal Council will recognise the new Kingdom of the Serbs, the Croats and the Slovenes subject to reservations as regards its eventual frontiers.With regard to the question of the return of Serbian cattle seized by the Bulgarians (see Report No. 110, page 3), the French Government informs Lord Derby (March 2.1st) that it has not been advised of the request, but considers that the Serbian Government should ask for the insertion of a clause contemplating the restitution of the cattle in the preliminary peace terms with Bulgaria, and ultimately with other enemy countries.   .The provisional National Assembly was formally opened by the Crown Prince on March 16th (Sir C. des Graz, March 1.6th, received March 26th).Blockade of Adriatic. Sir C. des Graz reported (March 22nd) that the Supreme War Council has ratified the decision of the Blockade Council at Paris to raise the commercial blockade of the Adriatic, and has also sanctioned the re opening of trade (with certain exceptions) between neutral and allied countries, and Jugo-Slavia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Albania and Montenegro. (See also under &quot;Italy.&quot;)UNITED STATES.Loans to British Bankers and Merchants. Lord Reading reports (March 22nd) a desire to lend money to British bankers and merchants to finance purchases of United States products, and gives the substance of a conversation on the subject which he has had with the Managing Director of the War Financial Corporation.Use of Enemy Ships for Relief Purposes. The Foreign Office has informed Lord Reading (March 21st) that the Associated Governments have agreed that all enemy cargo tonnage under the control of the Allied Maritime Transport Council is to be used in priority for the relief of liberated territories and enemy countries. Austrian vessels will proceed to North America to load foodstuffs, and as regards German cargo tonnage, the United States is responsible for securing delivery of vessels in neutral South America and Central America. The Foreign Office suggests that Lord Reading should ascertain whether the United States Government is taking the necessary action.Industrial Conferences. Lord Reading reports that the Industrial Board of Commerce is holding conferences with representatives of leading industries of the United States with a&quot; view to stabilizing the market for basic materials and hastening the return of normal activity. He gives particulars of the first and most important of these conferences, viz., with producers of steel products.enemy group.AUSTRIA HUNGARY.Czecho-Slovakia. Mr. Gosling (Prague.) reports (March 23rd) that, at the suggestion of the Czecho-Slovak Government, Prince Henry of Pless called upon him and told him of a movement amongst social and working classes in Silesia, to declare their independence of Crermany. lie asked whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would show practical sympathy with the movement, and. gave reasons why German Silesia should be assisted to its independence. A satisfactory assurance of Entente sympathy would, he said, result in the immediate proclamation of independence.
uHungary. Count. Karolyi, with the whole of the Hungarian Government, resigned on March 21st, and the Budapest Workmen&apos;s Council has formed a Ministry of extreme Revolutionary Socialists. The members of the Executive Council are :  Alexander Garbai (President) and Eugen handler (People&apos;s Commissary for Internal Affairs). The Peopled Commissariat for Agriculture consists of a Directory of four members : Alexander Ceizmadia, Karle Vantus, Eugen Hamburger, and George Nyisztor. Finance: Eugen Varga. Education: Sigmuud Ivunii. Labour and People&apos;s Welfare: Desider Rokanyi. Foreign Affairs: Bela Run. War: Josef Pogany. Commerce: handler (provisionally). Justice: Zoltan Ronai. Sociali-sation : Wilhehn Boehm. German People&apos;s Commissary : Heinrio Xalmar. Russian People&apos;s Commissary: Orestes Szabo. People&apos;s Food Supply: Merit/. Erdely. The new Cabinet has proclaimed the dictatorship of the proletariat, and has offered a military alliance to the Russian Soviet Government. It has further called upon the whole Hungarian people to join in defending Hungarian soil against the encroachments of Czecho-Slovaks and Rumanians.Sir C. des Graz states (March 25th) that the Crown Prince of Serbia sent for the Military Attache of the British Embassy, and spoke to him of the situation. He emphasised the necessity for strangling Hungarian Bolshevism at its birth, as later on grave difficulties would occur. He expressed the willingness of the Serbians to attack the Bolshevists provided a guarantee could be given that their other frontiers would be safeguarded. Three Serbian divisions would be ready to march on Budapest if the French complied with their demands for clothing aud ecpripmeut.Sir 0. des Graz has been informed (March 22nd) that the revolutionary Government at Budapest has declared a Bolshevik war against Serbia and surrounding countries, and is said to have opened the frontier towards Russia. All missions are being withdrawn from Budapest and two British monitors have been sent to ensure their safetjr.Hungarian Wireless of March 2-lth gives the official announcement of the formation of the new Government. It states that the Governmental power has been taken over provisionally by the Council of the People&apos;s Commissioners until the Congress of Peasants&apos;, Working Men&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council is able definitely to settle the constitution of the Hungarian Soviet Republic.Mr. Clive (Stockholm) is informed that Count KaroPyi resigned rather than identify himself with open hostility against the Rumanians and Czechs, which public opinion demanded, in view of the pronouncement by Colonel Dix in regard to the future frontiers of Hungary. The whole country, it is said, will in three weeks take up arms against the Rumanians and Czechs, and it is emphasised that the present movement is a national one and not yet a Bolshevik outbreak.On March 21-th Sir PI. Rumbold received a visit from the editor of Review Internationale, who brought a message from Count Andrassy to the effect that immediate action was necessary in Hungary, and asking for permission to go to Paris with a view of obtaining armed intervention at Budapest by British and French or American troops, which he guaranteed would receive the support of all the &quot; Bourgeois &quot; of Hungary if he was able to assure them that Hungary wotdd receive acceptable frontiers.GERMANY.Shortage of Raw Material. Sir W. Townley has been reliably informed that unless raw material can be supplied to Germany for her industries, Bolshevism will sweep over the country, and that there is no confidence in the present Government. The suggestion is made that British and Allied capital should be put into all the most important German industries, the Allies to supply the raw materials, and that German capital and expert knowledge might be allowed to be interested in British and Allied industries. The Foreign Office has instructed Sir W. Townley to-reject these proposals (March 2bth). A British officer, who visited certain German towns officially, states that it would be to our interest for supplies of food, clothing and certain raw materials to be sent to Germany as soon as possible.Exports from Norway of Fats and Dried Vegetables. Mr. Balfour reports that the Blockade Council has approved of the export of fat to Germany being increased from 7,500 tons to 10,000 tons, and of dried vegetables up to 0,000 tons.7570 -46 b
German Securities in Neutral Countries. The Foreign. Office has circulated a telegram stating that the original announcement made hy the French Government that the German Government had undertaken, under the Armistice Commission, that holdings of. German subjects abroad should not be disposed of without the previous assent of the Allies, was misleading, as the undertaking referred to the property of the German Government only. This inaccurate statement has caused confusion, and His Majesty&apos;s representatives in neutral countries have been instructed not to press any claim for the control of German private property abroad.National Wealth. A writer in Voriodrts estimates that tbe old regime left behind it war debts totalling 170 milliards of marks (8,500,000.000?.). To this must be added the cost of pensions, of victualling and of reparation to Belgium and Northern France, which he estimates at a further 80 milliards of marks (4,000,000,000?.), which would bring the total war-indebtedness up to 12,500,000,000?- Reckoning up the national wealth on pre-war figures, he finds that after deducting war-indebtedness it is reduced to roughly O,222,0OO,000Z., from which has to be deducted a further 500,000,000?. for the loss of Alsace-Lorraine. The future annual requirements of the Empire, States, and Communes are placed at about half the residual national income, and the writer questions the feasibility of diverting this sum to the public purse. National bankruptcy, he says, would fail of its purpose, for. the cessation of interest payment would affect the public revenue almost as much as it would expenditure. He predicts that.the.time will come when Germany will be unable to fulfil her financial obligations to the enemy-, and asserts that it would be dishonourable, under the circumstances, to make new promises.Coal Production. Before the war the production of coal was 162,000,000 tons per annum, while now it is placed at 39,000,000 tons.Food Situation. Memorandum G.T. 6990 gives a summary of the arrangements agreed upon by the Associated Governments for the supply of food to Germany. The Associated Governments &quot;will deliver to Germany the food now available in Europe for which payment has been arranged as soon as Germany shows her genuine intention to cany out her obligations by sending to sea for that purpose the ships to be selected by the Associated Governments. hThe Armistice Commissirn has requested the Allied Governments to sanction the commissioning of four small German cruisers to protect the German food-ships, in view of the refusal of certain Seamen&apos;s Unions to man them (German Wireless).The German Mark in Belgium. The Belgian Finance Committee, in Spa reports that last month the final withdrawal of the German mark from circulation in Belgium was accomplished. Belgium now wishes Germany to buy back the marks, stated to be about seven milliard, and lias asked that a German representative be sent to Spa who should be empowered to come to a final arrangement with the Belgian delegates. The German Government has replied that the final agreement must form part of the peace negotiations.Prussia: Ministerial Appointments. German Wireless of March 26th states that the following Ministerial appointments have been made in connection with the State Administration in Prussia : Herr Hirsch, President of the State Government; Herr Heine, Minister for Home Affairs ; Dr. von Zelmhof, Minister of J ustice; Herr Haenisch, Minister of Public Worship ; Dr. Suedekum, Minister of Finance ; Herr Braun, Minister for Agriculture ; Herr Stegervvald, Minister of National Welfare ; Herr Oeser, Minister of Public Works ; Herr Fischbeck, Minister of Commerce ; and Colonel Reinhardt, Minister for War.In connection with these appointments, the Premier, Herr Hirsch, gave a resume of the Government programme, during which he said, &quot;Liberty and order are the basic principles upon which the new Prussia is to be built up. We are desirous of taking over from the old Prussia what was good in it, the homely spirit of the fulfilment of duty. The new Prussia, precisely like the old Prussia, must long to be great.&quot;
NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.The Port Strike. A decree has been issued placing the port of Buenos Ayres-under official control, and, as soon as the Argentine Government can supply men, work will begin on oversea ships, but Sir R. Tower stated (March 17th) that it was uncertain whether the arrangements would prove successful. As it was feared that the refusal of the shipowners to concede back pay to the workmen for half of the period of the lock-out might delay indefinitely a solution of the difficulty, repre-sentatives of foreign commerce stated that they were prepared to raise funds to satisfy the men. Sir R. Tower, after consultation with the United States Ambassador, proposed this solution to the President, who, however, refused to accept it (Sir R. Tower, March 20th).Latest reports state that the loading of ships is being continued since the decree was issued, but that the prospect is bad (March 21st).BALTIC PROVINCES.Military Situation. (I) Latvia. Sir C. Marling is informed (March 19th) that the German Governor, von der Goltz, exercises full powers in Latvia, and calls his force &quot;troops of occupation,&quot; but the Lettish Government are trying to change the description to &quot; auxiliary force.&quot; The Lettish Government is stated to be, handicapped hy German authority, hut material and moral support from the Entente would, it is anticipated, place it in a firm position. It is suggested that a British General should he sent with a small staff and instructors to organise and command the Lettish Army which at present lacks leaders and organisers. It is believed that the Germans&apos; real objective is the River Dwina, in which case it is probable that the Bolsheviks will evacuate Riga, and it is considered to be important that the Lettish troops should enter the town, and a Lettish Government be established there, before the Germans arrive.The question of reopening trade with Lithuania and Latvia is under consideration, and Sir 0. Marling has been invited by the Foreign Office to express his views as regards certain matters in connection therewith.(2) Courland. Great privations are said to exist amongst the population of towns north qf Courland, recently captured from Bolsheviks, and appeals are made for relief in the shape of flour, yeast and salt, the effect of sending which would, it is asserted, greatly strengthen the position&apos; of the Lettish Government in dealing with local Bolsheviks (Sir C. Marling, March 20th\Exports -from Sweden to Baltic Provinces. In connection with this question, the Foreign Office is not prepared, under present circumstances, to give His Majesty&apos;s representative at Stockholm general authority to issue licences for voyages, and he has been instructed to continue to report applications (Foreign Office, March 21st).DENMARK.Export of Butler. The Danish Government and Danish agriculturists are showing considerable anxiety to resume the export of butter to England. At a meeting of representatives of interested parties with the British Commercial Attache, it was stated that exporters would, be prepared to make all possible concessions in regard to prices (Sir C. Marling, March 20th).The Schleswig Question. Sir 0. Marling has learned, from a reliable source, that Count Rantzau recently informed a deputation from South Schleswig that the Kiel Canal will remain German. This, he states, will strongly influence opinion towards Germany in South Schleswig as the people would be more likely to favour union with Denmark if there were to be a neutral zone (March 22nd).According to a German Wireless message, it is reported from a reliable source that the German Government is prepared to apply the Wilsonian programme with respect to the right of self-determination of peoples in reference to the Danish portion of North Schleswig. The Government also agrees that the question should be put to the people of North. Schleswig to ascertain whether they desire to become Danes ; or - whether the German liolsteiu people wish to remain within the German Empire.
sFINLAND.Finnish Independence. According to a Foreign Office telegram (March 22nd), representations have been made pointing out the vital necessity of formal recognition of Finnish independence by His Majesty&apos;s Government before the Diet meets on April 1st. Action will, however,-be postponed until a reply has been received from His Majesty&apos;s representative at Ilelsingfors in connection with the question of the removal of German agents from Finland. Mr. Bell reported (March 22nd) that the prevalent opinion at Helsingfors was that the new Government should be Republican in form. Me himself considers that, a Republic with General Mannerheim at the head might be the best solution, and would be supported by all. parties except the Social Democrats. The probable constitution of the new Government is given. On the other hand, Mr. Clive (Stockholm) transmits Mr. Branting&apos;s opinion that after the fall of the present Government, which he regards as inevitable, the Socialist and agrarian parties will coalesce to form a new Government, in which case he considers that General Mannerheim will not remain.Finnish Legion. The Foreign Office has received reports showing that the situation as regards the Finnish Legion is most critical, and that there is grave danger of their crossing the Finnish frontier. The points of a manifesto recently issued by Finns in northern Russia are detailed in a Foreign Office telegram (March 2ist) to His Majesty&apos;s representative at Helsingfors, who has been asked to furnish his comments thereon. Meanwhile it is suggested that the Finnish Govern-meut should select the Finns in northern Russia who can be permitted to return forthwith, aud also to frame a list of those who have committed crimes for which they will be tried on return to Finland. This solution, the Foreign OHice under-stands, will be satisfactory to the Finnish Legion.MEXICO.CarvanzaSs Policy. -His Majesty&apos;s representative at Mexico reports that amongst influential circles it is agreed that Carranza&apos;s attitude is placing Mexico&apos;s destiny at the mercy of the United States. A close friend of the President has informed Mr. Cummins that it was hoped Carranza would indirectly begin to take steps to redress the grievances of His Majesty&apos;s Government, which were admittedly justifiable. In reply to a request that a strong appeal should be made to obtain recognition of Carranza&apos;s Government, His Majesty&apos;s representative stated that was impossible until all the grievances had been redressed (March 20th).Arms. The Foreign Office has informed Lord Reading (March 22nd) that it will not allow arms to go to Mexico at present, and expresses the hope that the United States will act similarly.NETHERLANDS.Export of Herrings. The Foreign Office has informed Sir W. Townley (March 22nd) that it cannot agree to the export to unoccupied Germany of any of the Norwegian herrings lying in Holland.Transit of Goods through Holland. Arrangements have been made for the transit of goods destined for occupied territories on the left bank of the Rhine, and for Switzerland, Alsace-Lorraine and Belgium. The Standard Bank of South Africa will act as consignee of the goods and has undertaken to forward them by the most practicable route and as quickly as may be possible. It is proposed to use the Rhine for this traffic. Sir W. Townley has been instructed to inform the Netherlands Government of the arrangements and to ask them to facilitate the traffic (March 22nd).NORWAY.Political Situation-Sir M. Findlay reports (March 22nd) that an attempt is being made to bring about the resignation of the present Norwegian Government and to form a Coalition Government whose programme would be to put through proportional representation, whereupon the Coalition Government would resign, Parliament be dissolved, and elections held under the new system.
SPAIN.Government Crisis. Sir A. Hardinge reports (March 25th) that the Prime Minister has offered to resign on the ground of failure of Ins conciliatory policy, but will retain office to deal with situation at Barcelona.Labour Unrest. His Majesty *s representative at Barcelona reports that a general strike has begun there (March 24th), and that the employees of the Hispano-america Bank are preventing the opening of two British banks. Sir A. Hardinge (Madrid) is proceeding to Barcelona to endeavour to avert trouble. Later telegrams (March 25th and 26th) notify that a state of war has been proclaimed at Barcelona and that a general strike has begun at Madrid and Valencia. Sir A. Hardinge is informed that the Government is confronted with an organised and widespread attempt at violent social revolution, inspired by Russian example and ideas.Exports to Greece. Sir A. Hardinge favours the removal of all restrictions on shipments to Greece from Spain, with certain specified exceptions. Such a course, he states, would create a favourable impression in Spanish commercial circles. A later telegram (March 23rd) states that all control over exports to Greece from Spain can now be abolished.German Ships. Official confirmation has now been received of the verbal assurance given Iry the Spanish Prime Minister with regard to the flying of the Inter-Allied flag on the German ships (vide Reports Nos. 109, 110, and 111) with the reservation that this must not be interpreted as enabling the Inter-Allied Council to interfere with their free use by Spain so long as the legal question of her eventual right to the ships remains unsettled. The Foreign Office has agreed to this and has authorised Sir A. Hardinge (March 26th) to settle the matter finally as best he can.Export of Foodstuffs. Regulations have been issued by the Spanish Ministry of Supplies in connection with the granting of permits for the export of foodstuffs (Sir A. Hardinge, March 21st).SWEDEN.German Ships. The Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs has informed Mr. Clive that his Government has no intention of raising difficulties in connection with the release of German ships in Swedish ports provided such action does not prejudice Swedish claims (March 20th).Aland Islands. The Foreign Office has informed Mr. Clive (March 21st) that it is reluctant to take any side in the dispute in connection with the Aland Island delegation to the Paris Conference. Consequently it declines to adopt his suggestion that passports to England for the Finnish representatives should be temporarily withheld (see Report No. 1.11, page 9).SWITZERLAND.Recognition of German-Austria as independent State. The Swiss Government has been requested to recognise German-Austria as an independent State, and the President has endeavoured to obtain from Sir H. Rumbold the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the subject. Members of the Swiss Government have emphatically assured His Majesty&apos;s representative that the proposed union would be most undesir-able from their point of view (March 21st).Goods for Czecho-Slovakia. Sir PL Rumbold reports that the Swiss Government has agreed to facilitate the transit through Switzerland of Allied trains carrying goods for Czecho-Slovakia (March 21st).Ex-Emperor of Austria. Sir H. Rumbold reported (March 24th) that the ex-Emperor was due to arrive at the Swiss frontier that afternoon.75 70-110
