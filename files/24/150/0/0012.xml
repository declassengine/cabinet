SECRET.APPRECIATION  OK the  ATTACH El)  WESTERN   AND 0 ENERAEREPORT No. JUG.General.Considerable interest is now centred in the Posen Province. The German policy seems to be to base arguments upon the actual wording either of the Armistice Terms or of President Wilson&apos;s &quot; Points,&quot; whichever may be most advantageous to the German cause in the particular case affected. The German Government, in their latest wireless message published since the completion of this Report, agrees to take the necessary measures for the safe passage of the Paris Commission, while stipulating that Sovereign rights within the German State Frontiers are &quot; exclusively the affair of the German Government.&apos;&apos; Reports of the causes which have led to lighting between Poles and Germans within these frontiers are conflicting, and the situation should be clearer when the Commission has had the opportunity of first-hand investigation. Meanwhile, German policy does not favour a strong Poland, although it would be a buffer against the Bolshevik menace, of which so much capital has been made in negotiations. Paragraphs on Germany&apos;s future (page. 5) and on Posen (page 6) bear upon this subject.Information upon Bolshevism on page 2 is of interest. German and Bolshevik interests in weakening the Associated Powers by internal dissension are identical, and propagandists are active.   The need for counter-propaganda is indicated.Allied Countries.China (page 2). Repatriation of Chinese coolies is still being discussed.Italy (page&apos;3). The Report of proposed operations in Tripoli is important, as affecting the shipping situation.Untied Stales (page .-4). Both Bolshevik and anti-British propagandists seem to have attained some measure of success.Enemy Countries.Austria-Hungary and Germany (pages d-6). Apart from the points noticed above, the chief topics of interest are the representation of German-Austria at the German State Committee, and the attitude of the Soldiers&apos; Councils in Germany. The Government seems to have the Spartacus movement in hand for the present.N e li tua l  Co un Tit 1es.Finland (page 8).--It has been decided at Paris to postpone recognition. Spain (page .10).

WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Bolshevism. Sir M. Fincllay learns that a number of prisoners of war in Russia have been trained by the Bolsheviks for the purpose of spreading propaganda on their return to their native country. A school for agitators, which includes many Indians, is reported to have been established.Sir II. Rumbold reports that the International Socialist, Helphand, who was the intermediary between Lenin and the German Government previous to the Bolshevik revolution, was arrested on his return to Switzerland, but released at the instance of the German Minister at Berne. flelphaud is believed to be organising Bolshevism in the United Kingdom.Bolshevism is also dealt with under the &quot; United States,&quot; &quot; Germany,&quot; the &quot; Baltic Provinces,&quot; &quot;Denmark,&quot; &quot;Norway,&quot; and &quot;Switzerland.&quot;Superior Blockade Council. Sir G. Grahame (Paris) reports that a Superior Blockade Council was established on February 4th with Mr. MacCormick as Chairman. It was hoped that the work of the Council would be confined to matters of principle.The Council proposes to make the following announcement: &quot;In agreement with the Allies it has been decided as from to-day to remove all obstacles to trade with regard to exports shipped for the replenishment of Czecho-Slovakia.&quot; Exporters are, however, reminded that if they export to persons in that area as intermediaries for re-export to German-Hungary or German-Austria, they render themselves liable to penalties under the legislation now in force.&quot;It is further proposed to take similar measures with regard to Bulgaria and Turkey, subject to the approvaL of the Supreme. War Council, and to detailed arrangements for control.Mr. MacCormick intends to submit a resolution to the Council for the removal of the Black List and censorship with regard to Central and South America. Lord Derby has been informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government considers the maintenance of the. censorship essential and that therefore it cannot at present approve the proposed resolution.Export to Neutrals. Lord Derby reported on February 11th that it was proposed by the Allied Blockade Council to increase the ration of foodstuffs to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, and Switzerland to an amount equal to their normal consumption. Re-export to enemy countries might be permitted subject to the control of the Associated Governments. The United States Government is strongly in favour of this proposal.ALLIED  GROUP.CHINA.Repatriation of Enemy Subjects. Sir J. Jordan on February 4th represented that failure of the scheme might result if shipping were not forthcoming for the purpose at the proposed date.Northern Section of Chinese Rallieays. On February 6th Sir J. Jordan reported the Japanese attitude towrards the rights of a British Syndicate in connection with this section, after withdrawal of German interests.
0aWar Participation Bureau. This Bureau was originally established to organise troops for Europe, and is under General Tuan Chi Jiu. The question of the possible use of the troops raised (three Divisions and three Brigades) in the north as affecting the Shanghai Conference has caused some disquietude, and is the subject of discussion between the representatives at Pekin of the United States, Great Britain and Japan (Sir J. Jordan, February oth-Sth).Repatriation of Chinese Coolies from Russia. The question of the desirability and method of repatriation is being discussed between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the State Department in the United States (Mr. Barclay, February 7th).CUBA.Unsettled Situation. The internal situation appears again to be much unsettled. Owing to strikes of printers and compositors there were no newspapers on February Gth ; before that date a virulent campaign had been conducted against the Government (Mr. Cowan, February Gth). ,CZECHOSLOVAKIA. See under Austria-Hungary, on page -1.FRANCE. .German Attitude. Sir G. Grahame on February Gth called attention to comments in the French Press about the apparent resurrection of the old German spirit, especially as indicated in policy towards Poland.ITALY.Political Situation. The Political Intelligence Department on February 4th put forward a paper (G.T. 6764) on the political situation, as affected by the activities of various personalities in public life. A gloomy view is taken of the situation, for reasons given.Strike at Genoa. The merchant service struck at Genoa for increased pay on February 7th (Mr. Bleck).Projected Operations in Tripoli. There are indications that operations on a considerable scale are contemplated in Tripoli, Austro-Hungarian and other shipping to be used as transports (Sir R. Rodd, February Sth).PORTUGAL.Opo)-to Royalists. SirL. Carnegie, on February 6th, was acquainted by the Foreign Office about misleading Press telegrams published on February 3rd, Concerning the movements of His Majesty&apos;s ships as affecting the situation. The ultimate chances of the Royalists of being successful were not considered promising (Sir A. Hardinge, February 6th). All was reported to be quiet under the Juenta Government on February 9th (Mr. Grant). The Republican war vessels had bombarded Vianna Castello, an open town, and the Spaniards there had appealed to Madrid for protection.SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Banat. Difficulties in withdrawal westward of Serbian troops have been represented (Sir C. des Graz, February 2nd.)Fiume and Susah. The United States Ambassador in Rome has expressed the hope that the proposals of the Allied Admirals referred to in last week&apos;s Report (page 3) may be discussed with less formality in Paris (Sir R. Rodd, February 4th).
Montenegro. The French Foreign Minister thinks that the Montenegrins should not be hampered in determining their own future, and is inclined to favour inter-Allied occupation with this end in view. The subject is still under discussion between the Associated Powers (Sir G. Grahame, February (3th).Serbia. The Franco-Serbe Bank is expected to he the first bank to reopen at Belgrade (Sir C. des Graz, February 7th). *UNITED STATES OP AMERICA.Restrictions on Immigration. Organised Labour strongly favours the new Bill to prevent for four years all immigration ol steerage passengers with a view to protecting the labour market against Europeans, especially of the Bolshevik persuasion.   The Bill is expected to pass (Mr. Barclay; February 5th).Industrial Situation in Great Britain. On February 5th the Ministry of LabouFs report for the week ending on January 29th was communicated by cable to Mr. Barclay.Bolshevik Propaganda. After a large meeting had taken place in Washington on February 1st defending the Russian Bolsheviks, the Senate on February 4th passed a resolution to extend the scope of the Committee of the Senate dealing with German propaganda, so as to include enquiry into Bolshevik propaganda (Mr. Barclay, February 5th).Anti-British Propaganda. In view of activities in the Press and subsequent action in the Senate about the British &quot; embargo,&quot; Mr. Barclay is taking steps to place the truth before the American public through, the Press (Mr. Barclay, February 6th-8th). On February 10th Mr. Barclay forwarded a message to Lord Reading making suggestions for avoiding future misunderstandings.The Foreign Affairs Committee has favourably reported on a resolution about self-determination in Ireland and the Peace Conference (Mr. Barclay, February 7th).ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.German-Austria.-The German-Austrian Ambassador in Berlin, Professor Ludo Hartmann, has been appointed by the German-Austrian Government as representative of German-Austria at the German State Committee.At an election meeting in Austria Professor Hartmann expressed the hope that the German National Assembly in Weimar will think it its first important task to express agreement to the annexation of German-Austria to &apos;Germany, since German-Austria has become entitled to self-determination by this war (German Wireless report, February 6th).According to^a German Wireless report the Germans in Znaim and Southern Moravia have addressed an open letter to President Wilson in which they emphasise the suffering of the Germans in Southern Moravia and the despotism of the Czechs prevailing there, and in which they state that Znaim and the whole of Southern Moravia will be abandoned to economic ruin if Southern Moravia is made into a Czech State, because German Southern Moravia is united by a thousand ties of national, cultural and economic relations with. Vienna and Lower Austria, whilst there are no common interests at all with the Czech regions.It maybe pointed out that Znaim itself lies within territory which is ethnologically German.Vienna: Violent hunger riots are reported to have occurred in Vienna and Lintz (German Wireless, February 7th).
Economic Position of lite Czecho-Slovak Republic. According to the War Office Summary of Information (February 7th and .1.0th), an exhaustive Memorandum has been prepared dealing with this subject. In Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, agriculture is well developed, peasant proprietorship being general. Cultivation is carried on by advanced methods, the land being well manured, and machinery being largely used. The dairying, brewing, and especially the sugar (fourth in the world) industries are particularly mentioned. Agricultural syndicates, well organised and financially strong, have succeeded in acquiring many of these industries which hitherto have been largely held by German capitalists. Forestry is well developed. There is a considerable export trade in many forms of leather goods. The manufacture of machinery has been highly developed, but its export has been hampered by the Austrian tariff policy. There are rich beds of coal and lignite. Other important industries include the manufacture of textiles, and especially that of porcelain and glass. To sum up, it may be stated that in the last generation Bohemia and Moravia have become strongly industrialised, and the majority of the population of these two countries is now industrial, commercial, or professional in short, urban ; in Silesia, although industries flourish, the population is generally agri-cultural ; while Slovakia, apart from a few industrial patches, is purely agricultural. Of course, agriculture is becoming more industrialised.The industrial population is in general hard-working, intelligent and well educated.GFBMANY.The National Assembly.  Numerous accounts of the transactions of the National Assembly, which met at Weimar on February 6th, have appeared in the Press reports of the past week. The proceedings included inaugural speeches, election of officers, the passage of the Constitutional Bill, procedure, negotiations for the formation of a Coalition Ministry, and a Bill for the nationalisation of communications.On February 7th Dr. David (Majority Socialist) was elected President of the Assembly by 374 out of 399 votes. llerren Fehrenbach (Centre), Haussmann (Democrat), and Dietrich (Nationalist), were elected Yice-Presidents.On February 11th Herr Ebert was elected President of the Republic by 277 out of 379 votes. Count Posadowsky (Conservative) received 49 votes, Herren Scheide-mann and Erzberger 1 each.   There were 51 abstentions.The Independent Socialists have brought forward a motion for the immediate transference of the National Assembly to Berlin.In the various speeches the union of German-Austria with Germany and acceptance of President WilsoiFs League of Nations have been specially referred to.The Bavarian Envoy declared, on behalf of the Governments of Bavaria, Wiirttemberg, and Baden, that these Governments understood that the passing of the Constitutional Bill would not annul the decisions as to the special rights of the Free States (German Wireless, February 1.1th).Germany&apos;? Future. Sir H. Rumbold (Berne) has received a memorandum from the Berne representative of the Polish National Committee, The memorandum is based on the discussions which have taken place at various secret meetings which in Germany influence, public opinion to a considerable extent. One of the chief subjects of discussion is Germany&apos;s capacity to take revenge in the future. Germany has not suffered from the ravages of war and she is gifted with great productive energy. The people are still imbued with the national sentiment of German pre-dominance. This instinct fostered by politics, economics, philosophy, and even religion cannot be easily eradicated. There is a realisation, especially on the part of the Socialists, that militarism has proved a failure in achieving the desired results, so that now they look to the International, which can exert no baleful influence over the disciplined German people, to cause disorganisation in enemy countries.With regard to the territorial future of Germany the author of the memorandum draws special attention to a meeting which took place in Berlin immediately after the armistice, at which Erzberger and Naumann discussed the various eventualities which might result from the Peace Conference. The general impression was that the Allies could not do much harm to Germany even by encouraging the separatist tendencies of the Southern Federal States or by preventing the union between
German Austria and Germany, an arrangement which could have no permanency. The real fear was that the Allies might deprive Germany of some of her present territory, especially in the East. Even annexations on the Rhine would he iniinitely less dangerous than the loss of Rosen, East Prussia, and Upper Silesia. &apos; A strong-Poland would mean the death blow to Germany&apos;s future which was bound up in her capacity to exercise control over Russia. According to Erzberger, who was supported by the business men represented at the meeting, the militarists had struck too soon, before Germany had ensured her supremacy in the East, but she could profit by the lesson provided she could avoid suffering a mortal blow in the East.&apos; Bolshevism. Sir II. Rumbold has received through a reliable agent a message from some of the leading politicians of the new German Government, including Count. Brockdorff-Rantzau and Colonel Reinharclt. In this communication, which is intended for British authorities, the menace of a Bolshevik invasion is emphasised. It is asserted that the only means of resistance lies in the volunteer army, which at present only numbers 25,000 men, and is unlikely to increase beyond 100,000 in the future. Sir II. Rumbold&apos;s informant corroborated the statement that all classes were permeated with the fear of Bolshevism. A scheme is suggested for forming a cordon on the eastern frontier of Germany in conjunction with British and American troops.The editor of the Freie Zeitung is of opinion that under the pretence of opposing a Bolshevik invasion Hindenburg is endeavouring to create a large army with which to restore the old regime.Lord Kilmarnock learns that a letter from Berlin has been received by Bolshevik sympathisers in Copenhagen stating that the town and forts of Konigsburg would be surrendered on the approach of a Bolshevik army. It is further stated that Allied soldiers in the army of occupation are readily influenced by Bolshevik propaganda.Sir W. Townley reports the presence of herr von Kuehlmann at The Hague. Von Kuehlmann&apos; is reported as stating that, unless large supplies of food are sent to Germany, Bolshevism wdil become uncontrollable.Spartaens Movements. (1.) Berlin.. On February Sth there were repeated encounters between the Government troops and the mob, which was only parth* of a Spartacus character.   There were 20 casualties.   Order was eventually restored.(2) Bremen. The losses on February 4th, when the Government troops entered the town, are reported to have been 29 killed and 97 wounded.. The port has been occupied.   Bremerhaven has also been occupied by Government troops.(3) Oberhausen. Martial law has been declared owing to plundering by Spartacus bands.(4) LubeeJi. The Soldiers&apos; Council attempted to mobilise the garrison in order to help the Bremen Spartacists, but met with no success.(5) Kiel. In consequence of the continuance of Spartacist disorders a state of siege was proclaimed, on February 7th. The town is in the hands of loyal troops.(0) Hamburg. Violent disorders have broken out, chiefly on the part of armed workmen. On the 6th the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council decided that the workmen should surrender their arms. The troops are mostly loyal to the Government. Work is being resumed.(7) Munich. The Spartacist agitator, Dr. Levien, has been arrested on the charge of intriguing to bring about civil war.(8) dusseldorf. The Spartacus Party dominates the town. Various civic bodies and bourgeois corporations have sent an ultimatum to the Spartacus leaders demanding (1) unrestricted freedom of the Press ; (2) permission to hold meetings ; (3) free election of Municipal Commissaries. If the ultimatum is rejected a general strike is threatened. Citizens are invited not to pay taxes to the present authorities. &apos; The above information appears in the German Wireless reports.Soldiers&apos; Councils. The Soldiers&apos; Councils of almost all the Army Corps met in Berlin on Tuesday, February 4th, for the purpose of discussing the decree of the Ministry for War regarding the settlement of the Commando Administration, and the -decree was strongly opposed by the majority of the speakers.   Simultaneously the
representatives of the 9th Army Corps especially attached People&apos;s Commissary Noske, for the way he had acted against Bremen, which-lies within the region of the 9th Army Corps. Finally, a vote of lack of confidence was adopted against Noske and Scheidemann (German Wireless report, February Oth).The new Brunswick National Assembly was opened on Monday, February !.0th, by the Chairman of the National Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils, who stated : &quot;The laws which have already been decreed by the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils, as well as the laws regarding the separation of the Church and the State, must be regarded as inviolable, and the Diet will not have to occupy itself with them any more. The Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council must remain the supreme authority, and thus&apos;must have the deciding voice &quot; (German Wireless, February 12th).Posen. Colonel Wade (Warsaw) has been informed by the Polish Foreign office that, in spite of the endeavours of the National Council for Peace, hostilities are still being carried on in the Province of Posen. The proposal of the Polish delegates in Berlin for the establishment of a truce has been rejected by the Germans. The latter demand the demobilisation of all Polish troops in the province. The Polish army has maintained a defensive attitude.On the other hand German Wireless reports continue to protest against Polish aggression.   Thus : The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Count Brockdorff-Rantzau, has replied to the protest of the Region of Meseritz against Polish unrest : &quot; The Government of the Empire will, with all the means at its disposal, exert its influence at the Peace Conference to prevent German territory from being severed from the German Empire. 1 also hope that it will soon succeed, by reinforcing the troops there, in repelling the invaders and averting all peril from that region.&quot;Considerable fighting appears to have taken place in the neighbourhood of Itawitsch (between Posen and Breslau). According to a German Wireless report dated February 7th, the Polish National Council has convoked for March 20th elections for the Constituent National Assembly of Great Poland, also in the Polish-speaking regions in Prussia, including West Prussia and Dantzig.Attention is drawn to an article by Major Endres, the gist of which is given in Tito Times of February loth (Through German Eyes), dealing with the military situation on the Eastern front.NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.The Strike. On February Oth Sir R. Tower reported that the strike of the dock labourers had been resumed and that shipping business had been suspended. He has been instructed by His Majesty&apos;s Government to impress the Argentine Government with the necessity of protecting the lives and property of British subjects in the event of disturbances.BALTIC PROVINCES.Military Situation. (.1) Livonia. According to Russian Wireless reports, in the Pskov region the Red Lettish troops have retired to the station of Izborsk (30 versts west of Pskov). On the southern front they have retired to positions 25 versts south-west of Valk. On the coast they have occupied Khainash and Zalismunde (north-of Riga). Lord Kilmarnock points out that hy the capture of Valk and Verro one of the main lines of communication to Riga has been cut.(2) Gourland.-ln the direction of Libau the Bolsheviks have reached Shrunden (Riga, February Oth).At Mitau volunteers are reported to be pouring into Red Lettish regiments (Mitau, February Oth).
Lord Kilniariioek has received a report; from Lear-Admiral Sir W. Cowan to the effect that the Lettish Government has strengthened its position, and is better prepared to resist the Bolshevik invasion. Relations between the Esthonians and Letts have improved, and the Baltic Germans are showing an increased willingness to co-operate with them. On the other hand, Lord Kilmarnock points out that the Bolsheviks may later be in a position to dispatch a large army against Esthonia. lie urges the necessity of co-ordination, especially with regard to the higher command, which at Libau is in the hands of the Germans, and suggests that the co-ordination of Allied policy in the Baltic Provinces might be effected through the machinery of a League of Nations.&apos; Laud Nationalisation. The estates of the Barons are being nationalised, and a Soviet Economy with hired labourers is being established. The Riga Soviet has issued an order to make lists of counter-revolutionaries, organisers of the White Guards and the agents of the Powers in occupation, to keep them under observation and to hand over their property to the local Soviets (Russian Wireless, February 4th).Food Supplies at Itiga. The following telegram from Riga, dated January 31st, is repeated in the official Russian Wireless reports : At a conference discussing the question of food supplies, reports from the provinces showed that the situation there was most acute. The Conference decided to monopolise articles of primary necessity and to institute class rations. The monopolisation of food supplies will be effected with the help of the Workmen&apos;s Co-operative Societies, 45 of which exist in Riga. They form the Union of Workmen&apos;s Co-operative Societies. Co-operative Societies protecting the interests of the well-to-do are to be nationalised.&quot;Gable Censorship. -Lord Kihnarnock learns that the German censorship of telegrams at Libau has been removed (vide Report No. 105, page 7).Danish Assistance. Lord   Kilmarnock reports   that  as the  result of active&apos; recruiting, some 250 Danish volunteers are ready to sail to the Baltic.   It is hoped that this number may be eventually raised to 1,000, but this will only be practicable if equipment is provided in the immediate future.The Admiralty state that British tonnage cannot be provided for the transport of this force, but that an escort will protect any Danish ships which may undertake the voyage.DENMARK.Bolshevism. Lord Kilmarnock reports that the Bolshevik representative, Herr Suritz, together with the personnel of the Bolshevik Legation, left Copenhagen for Russia on February Oth.FINLAND.German Intrigues (vide Deport No. 105, page S). His Majesty&apos;s representative at Helsingfors has been informed by the Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs that steps are being taken to eliminate pro-German elements. Colouel Ausfeld left Finland on January 18th, and another officer in the Jaeger Regiment is being dismissed from the service.Recognition. His Majesty&apos;s representative was informed&apos; on February 7th that it had been decided at Paris to postpone official recognition of Finnish independence pending the disposal of the whole Russian question.MEXICO.German Relations. It is stated in the Press that official confirmation has been given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the statement that the Mexican Govern-ment has recognised the Provisional Government of Germany.
The Government has published a communication in the Press refusing to recognise the new Armistice conditions. Such recognition is stated to be contrary to the Mexican constitution, which guarantees to foreigners free disposal of their property, and the Treaty of Friendship between Germany and Mexico. It is further asserted, in contradiction to the above statement, that the Mexican Government lias no knowledge of a legally constituted German Government and that no information has been received of Germany&apos;s acceptance of the Armistice terms. His Majesty&apos;s representative points out that the clause of the constitution referred to has not been applied to British property.Cuba. Mr. Cummins reports that diplomatic relations with Cuba are believed to have been broken off.Indian Revolutionary Ageulx.--]Tis Majesty&apos;s representative reports that public conferences have been held by Indian revolutionary agents in Mexico for the purpose of discrediting British rule in India. An international league of &quot;Friends of India &quot; has been formed with the object of arousing sympathy for the Nationalist movement in India. Similar leagues are to be formed throughout the Spanish American Republics. Mr. Cummins has warned Carranza that if he permits these seditious utterances, his action may be interpreted as a breach of neutrality.NETHERLANDS.Passage of Troops. On February 3rd Mr. Balfour informed His Majesty&apos;s representative at The Hague that, owing to the congestion on French ami Belgian railways which was affecting not only demobilisation, but also the supply of food to the civil population in Germany, it was essential to use Dutch railways and waterways for the transport of troops and to conclude an agreement with Holland for this purpose. The troops Avere returning home to be demobilised. Therefore their passage could not involve the promotion of military operations against Germany, and Holland as a neutral was tinder no obligation to prevent it. A general breakdown of the essential lines of communication would be as little to Dutch as to Allied interests. A number of conversations have taken place on this subject between His Majesty&apos;s representative at The Hague and the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs. The latteFs attitude towards England has been favourable and he has been impressed by the suggestion that delay in demobilisation may produce disaffection among the troops and a tendency towards Bolshevism. He does not think that the Netherlands Government will object to the transport of troops and munitions down the Rhiue or Scheldt, but it is opposed to transit by rail and to the men carrying their arms.NORWAY.Resignation of the Ministry. Sir M. Findlay reports that the Ministry resigned on February 4th. Mr. Ualvorsen, the leader of the Conservative Party, has recommended a Coalition Government of Conservatives, Liberals, and Socialists, to which the liberal leader, Mr. Tveiten, is not unfavourable. The attitude of the Socialist leader, Mr. Buen, is not yet known.Sir M. Findlay believes that the Prime Minister expects the Socialist Party to refuse to join the coalition and the Liberals to refuse to join it without the Socialists. The Conservatives would then be compelled to ask the liberals to form a Government under the Prime Ministers leadership.Bolshevism. Mr. Ovey has been instructed to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, in view of the fact that the Bolshevik Government has been invited to send representatives to the proposed Conference at Prinkipo, the. Allied Governments do not intend to enter into any other negotiations with Bolshevik agents.General Mannerheim. It is reportediri the Press that the King of Norway and the Government have invited GeneraL Mannerheim and the Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs to visit Christiania in the near future.Sir M. Fihdlay reports that the Socialists have protested, against this visit since they hold General Mannerheim responsible for the massacre of Bolshevik prisoners.
SPAIN.Enemy Shipping. His Majesty&apos;s Government lias informed Sir G. Grahame (Paris) that in view of the terms of the Treves Agreement by which all German ships are to be handed over to the Allies, Spanish interference cannot be justified (vide Report No. 105, page 9). Any such surrender would create a dangerous precedent with regard to other neutrals who might put forward similar demands, it is thought advisable, therefore, that the Spanish Government should be informed that, if Germany agrees to hand over her ships, any interference by a neutral Government might be interpreted as a breach of neutrality.On -January 3rd Sir G. Grahame reported that the Spanish Government had refused to allow the entry into Carthagena of French tugs carrying crews for the ships assigned to France. The French Government - had therefore instructed its representative at Madrid to accede to the Spanish request without waiting for the German notification to the Spanish Government as to the surrender of the ships. The French Ambassador handed to the Spanish Government an official note to this effect on February 6th.Sir A. Hardinge reports that in the King&apos;s opinion the French Colonial Party is responsible for the French attitude, and is using the question of the six ships to pick a quarrel in connection with Morocco. Sir A. Hardinge thinks that the Spanish Government only wishes to satisfy public opinion and to save its dignity, and states that it is willing to refer the legal aspect of the question to the future decision of an international tribunal. On February 5th he stated that the circumstances of the Spanish claim were exceptional, and rested on the voluntary cession of the six ships by Germany to Spain before the armistice. Spain would only yield to a legal decision or to force.-Meanwhile the Foreign Cilice has been informed by the Spanish Ambassador in London that in order to force, a decision the Spanish Government is preparing to despatch the ships to Argentina. Lord Hardinge lias therefore informed His Majesty&apos;s representative at Madrid that in the event of the vessels putting to sea they will run the risk of capture as enemy ships.Sir A. Hardinge reported on February 9th that he had received a note from the Prime Minister stating that the Government had been officially informed of Germany&apos;s consent to the naval conditions of the Armistice.Portugal. According to a semi-official Press communique, the Spanish represen-tative at Lisbon has informed the Portuguese Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Spanish Government has instructed the frontier authorities not to give any assistance to Portuguese agitators and to intern all Portuguese subjects who take part in political intrigues.Anglo-Spanish Agreement. Sir A. Hardinge reported on February 2nd that steps were being taken to prepare the way in the Spanish Press for the denunciation of the agreement (vide Report No. 105, page 9). It was important, both on commercial and political considerations, to prevent any diminution in the supply of coal to Spanish, industries. It must also be impressed on public opinion that the agreement was solely a war measure.SWEDEN.Austrian liar Material. According to information received by the Italian Government some 50 to 60&apos;million crowns&apos; worth of Austrian war material is stored in Sweden. His Majesty-s Government has concurred in the French proposal that application should be made to Sweden for the transport of this material vid Dantzig for the benefit of the Polish Army.SWITZERLAND.Bolshevik Relations.- On February 4th Sir II. Rumbold reported, that the Swiss Government in a circular note to the missions at Berne had called attention to the detention in Russia by the Soviet Government of M.
