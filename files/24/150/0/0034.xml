&quot;WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.The Blockade. On receipt of the notification that the Peace Treaty had been duly ratified by Germany the Council of Five decided that the conditions prescribed in M. Clemenceau&apos;s letter of June 27th had been fulfilled and that the Blockade of Germany should therefore be raised as from July 12th (Astoria, July 11th).THE BALTIC STATES.Political Situation. M. Ulmanis arrived at Riga on July Sth and took over the civil government from&apos;Colonel Tallents. The latter reports that the town is quiet, though a state of nervousness prevails among the populace. A loan from the Allies, the opening up of trade, and the prevention of unemployment are the first requirements (Mr. Bosanquet, July 11th).The People&apos;s Council has accepted the Lettish Coalition Government (Mr. Grant Watson, July 14th).Mr. Grant Watson states that reports have been received to the effect that the Russian troops at Mitau, especially those under the command of Prince Lieven, have come under German influence. Placards have been posted in the town calling for German volunteers for the Russian Army. German agents foster the belief that Germany is working for a united Russia.According to the latest information received from Reval and Libau the Germans are concentrating a large number of troops, together with tanks and armoured cars, at Mitau.   Many of these troops are said to have arrived fresh from Germany.On the other hand. Mr. Grant Watson reports that at Libau the garrison consists of Letts, Russians, and Baits under a British commandant, and that the commander of the Russian troops is in sympathy with the Entente.The German Government has addressed a Note to M. Clemenceau requesting that adequate protection may be given to the German population of Latvia in the absence of German troops.CHINA.The Peace Treaty. The Chinese delegates at the Peace Conference have addressed a telegram, of which the following is a summary, to the representatives of the North and South, explaining the reason for their refusal to sign the Treaty : &quot; We have been struggling for a reservation regarding the three clauses relative to Shantung in the Peace Treaty, and have exhausted all our resources in vain. We had been acting on the supposition that the aim of the Paris Conference was the establishment of a permanent world peace in which Right rather than Might would reign. Unfortunately the situation suddenly changed, and we cannot yield to the Powers&apos; decision which is tantamount to a death warrant on our nation. We accordingly refused to sign the treaty.&quot;   (Sir J. Jordan, July Sth.)Thibet. Sir J. Jordan, in collaboration with the Chinese Government, has issued a statement refuting the allegation made in certain Japanese controlled newspapers that Great Britain was using the Thibet question to extract concessions from China. It is pointed out that Great Britain, on China&apos;s invitation, is considering proposals made by China for arriving at a settlement of the long-standing frontier dispute with Thibet.&apos;Military Party&apos;s Activity. Sir J. Jordan learns that under the pretence of taking-measures against possible Bolshevik encroachment the military party is concentrating troops in Mongolia and the North-West. General Hsu Sim Cheng, who is a strong-supporter of Japanese policy, has been appointed Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief in the North-West with extensive territorial powers.   It is thought that the
Avhole scheme is nothing but an attempt on the part of the military party to strengthen their positiou with a view to co-operating with the Japanese in exploiting the mineral resources in the above regions.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.New Cabinet. According to a telegram dated July 9th from Mr. Gosling a new Cabinet was formed by President Masaryk on July 8th. Dr. Tusar, the late Czecho-Slovak Minister in Vienna, becomes Prime Minister. The Social Democratic Party-have now three Ministers in place oF two. The National Socialists lose their three Ministers ; the Agrarian Party gain one.German Bohemia. The following announcement is made in the German Wireless Deport of July 12th :-&quot; With reference to the already reported request of the German-Bohemian National Government to the German-Austrian Chancellor Renner, to enlighten the Entente Governments, who have been falsely informed by the Czecho-Slovaks as to the true result of the communal voting in German-Bohemia and as to the national character of the country resulting therefrom, it is now known that the voting in the whole of Bohemia gave a proportion of two Czechs to one German, which is in exact agreement with the national census of 1910. On the other hand, in German-Bohemia, taken alone, among 2-J- million inhabitants only 135,000 are Czechs, i.e., only 7^ per cent., which means that German-Bohemia actually represents a self-contained single-language area of German settlers.&quot;FRANCE.The Strikes.- On July lOch Lord Derby reported that the miners had accepted the arbitrament of the Ministers of Labour and Reconstruction, and had decided to resume work. They are granted an increase of pay ranging from one franc to three frances fifty and the fixation of minimum wages.On July 11th the employees of restaurants, cafes and hotels declared a strike. Their demands included an eight hours&apos; day, a minimum salary, &amp;c.The following unions have announced their intention of participating in the 21- hours&apos; strike on July 21st: Theatre employees, dockers, miners, taxi-drivers, railwaymen, sailors, and the Union of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones. Among the working classes themselves, however, there are indications that the strike is not popular. The Government is adopting a firm attitude, and has issued a circular to the Post Office employees and the railwaymen pointing out that a stoppage of work will retard demobilisation and increase the distress in liberated districts, and warning-strikers of the penalties they incur (Lord Derby, July 11th and 12th).GERMANY.Political and Labour Situation. (1) General. According to German Wireless reports the belief prevails that an attempt will be made to broaden the Government by the admission into its ranks of the Democratic Party. Herr von Payor, who is a south German, has refused re-election to office as leader of the party owing to.their failure to support tho Coalition Government in its decision to sign the Peace Treaty. Herr Schiller has been elected to the leadership of the party in his stead.Herr Wissell, the Minister of Economics, has handed in his resignation. He is an ardent advocate of socialisation. In this relation it is of interest to note that the feeling of the Trades Union Congress which recently met at Nuremburg was distinctly in favour of a complete system of socialisation.(2) Berlin. Though the train service has been resumed on one important line, the strike of transport workers continues. The extremists are blamed for inducing the men to remain on strike contrary to the advice of their own organisations.(3) Hanover. A state of siege has been proclaimed owing to conflicts between Spartacists and Government troops. Communist leaders have been arrested, though Gotteburg, who is considered the most influential of them, has effected his escape.(4) Oberhausen. A state of siege has been proclaimed in consequence of riots.
a.(5) Saxony. In spite of an increase in wages the strike in the coal mining industry continues.(G) Silesia. The strike on the lower Silesian railway continues.(7) Munich. Lord Acton learns that the capital is .quiet. Trices are high, but an abundance of food is obtainable by the wealthy classes. The Hoffmann government-ment remains at Bamberg.State Rights and Separatism. The Weimer correspondent &quot;of the Kolnisehe Zeitung (July 7th) states that a controversy is raging between the Centrum and the Social Democratic Party on the question of denominational schools. A compromise has been reached whereby the retention of these schools is permitted in individual States pending the settlement of the question by Imperial law. This decision has brought forward the larger question of State rights, as the Centrum hope to frustrate the intended Imperial law by strengthening particularist tendencies, and by redrafting-Article 18 of the new Constitution Bill, which provides certain facilities for particular districts to sever themselves from the State as hitherto constituted, and form a new State within the German &quot;Reich.&quot; The Prussian Government is strongly averse to any compromise in this direction, as tending to the disintegration of Prussia.Meanwhile assertions to the effect that Separatist movements are being conducted in Hesse, the Rhine Palatinate, and the Rhineland with the support of the French are again occupying a prominent place in the German Press. .The Vossische Zeitung (July 10th) publishes a telegram from Weimar which states that the Upper Silesian Deputies of the National Assembly had a long-discussion on July 9th with representatives of the Imperial and Prussian Govern-ments, with the result that the question of autonomy for Upper Silesia has been finally settled in the negative sense. Even Centrum deputies are said to have expressed their opposition to such autonomy being granted.The Eastern Provinces. On July Sth the President of the German Peace Delegation, Freiherr von Lersner, handed a note to M. Clemenceau which may be summarised as follows : In order to carry out the Peace Treaty in Germany&apos;s Eastern Provinces, extensive preparations will be necessary directly after the ratification of the Peace Treaty.The withdrawal of the German authorities from the district to be ceded will undoubtedly lead to complications, especially in the matter of internal administration. The German Government, therefore, considers it indispensable to conduct negotiations direct with the Polish Government. The object of these negotiations would be to secure the transfer of local authority and to arrange for the withdrawal of Prussian officials. The most suitable place for these negotiations would be Berlin, and an early reply is requested as to whether the Polish Government agree to this proposal and are ready to appoint representatives with tho least possible delay.Economic Agreement with Russia. Lord Acton learns from a reliable source that an economic agreement has been concluded between the German and Russian Soviet Governments. It is said that the agreement provides for the colonisation and exploitation of Russia by Germany.Pan-German Activity. Lord Acton reports that the ex-Crown Prince of Bavaria has secured Pan-German support in a scheme for the creation of a new monarchy embracing Bavaria and German Austria.Occupation of the Rhine. The first meeting between the German Commission for the Rhineland and representatives of the occupying Powers took place at the Hotel Trianon at Versailles on July 11th. The German President was Herr Lewald and the Chairman of the Allies M. Loucheur.Herr Lewald said that, although the German Government were aware that nothing could be altered in the Agreement, nevertheless in particular districts special arrangements were necessary, in order to put into effect its conditions. He emphasised the necessity of giving the inhabitants full freedom to exercise their civil rights and of removing the restrictions upon communications of all kinds. He presented the wishes of the Government with regard to each article in turn.M. Loucheur said it was their desire to do what was possible to alleviate the burdens of the population, but that the questions raised were so many sided that he proposed to postpone the discussion until investigation had been made by the occupying Powers. The Germans agreed to this and decided to return to Germany (Nauen, July 14th).
GERMAN-AUSTRIA.Relations with Hungary. According to a Wireless report circulated from Nauen; Herr Bauer, the German-Austrian State Secretary; lias handed a Note to the Hungarian Peoples Commissary for Foreign Affairs protesting against the way in which several institutions set up by the Hungarian Legation in Vienna have been not only interfering in the internal politics of German-Austria, but also by abuse of their extra-territorial position have plotted and even in some cases committed hostile acts. Czobel, the present Hungarian Minister of the Soviet Republic, has not only permitted, but not even tried to prevent these machinations. The German-Austrian Government is therefore compelled regretfully to inform the Government of the Soviet Republic that Czobel is no longer acceptable as its representative in Vienna.In reply to this Note, Bela Kun has&apos; protested against the treatment of the Hungarian Minister and the anti-Hungarian Press campaign in A^ienna.HUNGARY.&quot;The Entente and Rumania. Bela Kun has addressed a Note to M. Clemenceau protesting against various acts of aggression committed by the Rumanians in spite of the promises of the Allied Powers. The Note states that the Rumanian troops have not only failed to withdraw according to the terms of the Agreement, but since June 24th have launched several attacks against the Hungarians.In reply, the Peace Conference declared that they could not enter into discussions with Bela Kun as long as Hungary failed to observe the Armistice conditions. This reply produced a further Note from Bela Kun requesting a statement as to the manner in which Hungary had failed to cany out the Armistice conditions, and demanding the immediate withdrawal of ths Rumanian troops from the line of the River Theiss (Hungarian Wireless Reports, July 11th to 14th).Anti-Bolshevik Feeling. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Bucharest sends the following report (July 1st) : &quot; General Greenly, who returned last night from the Hungarian front, reports that the whole population including Hungarian elements, implores the protection of the Allies against the Bolsheviks and Bela Kun. This is in accordance with accounts which have reached me from all quarters. If those parts of Hungary outside Bolshevik control may be taken as a criterion, there is no doubt that the mass of the population abhors the present Bolshevik regime, and would welcome Allied or even Rumanian intervention.&quot; Reports from Hungary itself are somewhat contradictory, but it would appear that Bela Kun -is delighted at being treated by the Conference as the head of a responsible Govornment, and is therefore anxious to accede to requests made to him from Paris. He has, however, little control over the troops who are under German influence, and are defiant and full of confidence in their ability to crush the Czecho-Slovaks and ignore the Allies.&quot;Count Karolyi&apos;s Government. General Franchet cPEsperay reports that he has received a letter from Count Julius Karolyi stating that a provisional Hungarian Government was constituted at Arad on May 5th with the object of combating Bolshevism and rendering possible the re-establishment of a legal and constitutional administration. The Government was subsequently transferred to Szeged. It is composed as follows : President of the Council and Minister ofthe Interior    . -         - -         - Count Jules Karolyi.Minister for War     -         - -      - Nicolas de Horthy.Minister for Foreign Affairs -         - Count Paul Teleki.Minister of Finance -         - -      - Baron Louis Solymossy.Minister of Commerce     - Louis Varjassy.Minister of Agriculture      - -      - Jean Kintzig.Minister    of    Religion     and PublicInstruction      -         - ... Bela Kelemen.Minister of Justice -         - -      - Vacant.Minister of Public Welfare -         - Reserved for the Socialists.Minister of Food     -         - - Ditto.8429- 3!) - B
Certain, posts remained, unfilled as the support of the Socialists has not yet been secured.Sequestration of Securities. Instructions have been circulated by the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the name of the Peace Conference, to the represen-tatives of the French Government in Allied and other European countries, to represent to the Governments to which they are accredited that all banks in Hungarian territory have been ordered by Bela Kun to hold at his disposal all securities deposited with them. The circular states that this action is nothing less than robbeiy, and draws attention to the clanger which is incurred to all countries by the creation of funds for the purpose of organising destructive propaganda in foreign countries. It is proposed that the Governments concerned should forbid or supervise the importation and negotiation of all securities coming from Hungary.ITALY.Food Riots. On July 10th Sir R. Rodd reported that the food disturbances in Rome had taken the form of a general strike. No newspapers had appeared, shops were shut, and the tramway service was suspended. Riots had occurred in certain parts of the city. A similar situation, was reported to prevail in Milan. Naples was patrolled by troops. In Florence the attitude of the populace was calmer. The following day the situation both in Rome and Turin improved (July 11th).The President of the Council stated in the Chamber that food conditions presented an element of danger which by proper discipline, the assistance of the Allies, and a wise use of national resources might be surmounted. Thanks to the measures already adopted order was being maintained. The Minister of Commerce said that steps had now been taken to prevent the reversion from one extreme to the other by the sale of goods under cost price, which could only lead to famine. Speculators would be punished, but with the exception of one or two caterers over whom the State must for the present retain control, the Government intended to give the fullest, liberty to trade and private enterprise (July 13th).Labour Demonstration. Sir R. Rod! reports that the Governing Board of the General Confederation of Labour at a meeting with the directing Committee of the Socialist Party and Railway Workers&apos; Syndicate has decided in favour of a general and simultaneous strike on July 20th and 21st which will have the significance of a general mobilisation of the International proletariat forces against International plutocracy, which constitutes the enemy of liberty, and will mark their unconditional solidarity with the Russian and Hungarian workmen in their efforts to control the State.T7ic Government&apos;s Policy. Parliament re-assembled on July 10th. Signor Nitti summed up the Governments programme in four points: (1) the conclusion of peace negotiations in conformity with national aspirations ; (2) the acceleration of the transit from a state of war to a state of peace ; (3) the amelioration of the life of the people and the control of prices ; (4) the rapid adoption of new economic and financial measures. The Government, he said, was determined to maintain order and to combat the spirit of anarchy. Increased production and reduced consumption were the only remedies for the financial situation caused by the war. Foreign policy must in future be that of the people, without whose consent the nation should not be involved in alliances or wars. He deplored the recent incidents at Fiume, which had been exaggerated in the Press. Such episodes, however, could not affect relations with France, which were cemented in danger and consecrated by blood. The reform of the Senate and electoral reform on the basis of proportional representation would be taken in hand at once.Signor Nittfs speech was received with approval except by the Socialists and the members of the Federation of National Defence (Sir R. Rottd, July 10th).On July 14th the Government received a majority of 146 in a vote of confidence in the Chamber.Signor Tittoni on the Peace Negotiations. On July 11th Signor Tittoni made a statement in the Chamber previous to his departure for Paris. He proposed in the near future to explain in full the advantages and disadvantages of the Treaties, but in view of the pending decisions in Paris, he was unwilling at present to compromise himself by making a full statement. He stated that the Treaty with Austria assuring Italy economic and territorial advantages would be signed, with the exception of the
question, of Asia Minor 0013-, as to which Wilson&apos;s consultation with the American people must he awaited before a solution was reached. As for the Adriatic questions, colonial and economic, they had arrived at a point at which resolution was absolutely necessary. Any delay would be fraught with extremely dangerous consequences. Certainly the Delegation would not insist upon an over hasty settlement, but it would not consent to the settlement being uselessly deferred. He concluded by saying that the Delegation was as one in its thoughts and intentions regarding annexation and required to be supported solidly by Parliament in order that the peace to be signed should be an Italian peace. Meanwhile, Signor Tittoni appealed to the people to refrain from demonstrations against the nations with which they were negotiating, and to act with restraint and consideration (Rome, July 11th).The New Cabinet. Sir It. Rodd in a despatch dated June 24th prefixes his notes on the political leanings of certain members of the new Cabinet by the following remarks : -&quot; It must be remembered that there is a special difficulty in forming just estimates as to the political leaning of representatives in Italy, because the party system as we understand it does not really exclusively govern allegiances, with tho exception perhaps of those of the Socialist group, and even that is now divided. There is a tendency rather to follow men than principles, and the evil system under which Giolitti attained to power, by attaching to himself men of all colours and parties whom he secured by obligations for favours received by themselves or their constituents, has made political life unrepresentative and insincere. Thus men Avho could not detach themselves from the Giolittian fetters might be found on the right, or 011 the left, or in the centre of the Chamber, as Liberals, Moderates, or Radicals. In addition, there were always a certain number who had little political colour, and had become merely adherents of Giolitti. It is not enough then to consider to what party a representative really belongs, but it is necessary to have supplementary knowledge of his personal allegiance.&quot;&apos;Signor Nitti, who passes for an Independent Radical, was Minister of Commerce and Agriculture in GiolittFs Cabinet, 1911-13. Though relying for the present on the support of Giolittfs followers, he is probably too strong a man to remain permanently under his influence.Signor Tittoni was chosen by Giolitti as Minister for Foreign Affairs, 1903-05. .It is generally thought that he approved Giolitti&apos;s views on the subject of neutrality during the war; and while Ambassador in Paris he was consistently in favour of restricting the field of Italy&quot;s war activity. He has, however, been careful not to commit himself to any such views in public and has rather posed as a vindicator of Italian claims in Asia Minor and Africa. He is a Conservative by nature and undoubtedly desires to stem the tide which leads to Bolshevism.Signor Luigi Rossi, the new Minister of the Colonies, though sitting on the Right in the Chamber, has been described as a Giolittian.Signor Tedesco, the Minister of the Treasury, and Signor Schanzer are constant followers of Giolitti.The allegation that Senator Hortara, Signor Pontano, and Signor Ferraris are sympathisers with Giolitti must be taken with reserve. Sir R. Rodd sums up as follows : &quot; The further information contained in this despatch may serve to attenuate the charge which has been brought against Nitti of having formed a Giolittian Cabinet. It is probably safest to mistrust the application of such a label. Signor Nitti has taken what he can get, and has formed a composite Government. The result is not brilliant, but for the present, at any rate, he has not thrown himself in the arms of the official Socialists. He continues to have a bad press, and the administration is mistrusted for various reasons in the country generally. But the Chamber does not represent the country, and the former, I think, will give him a majority.&quot;JAPAN.Baron Kato&apos;s Speech. In an important speech to his party delivered on July Oth, Baron Kato strongly condemned the present Government on the following charges :  (1) The increased cost of living; (2) failure to treat labour questions in an enlightened spirit; (3) failure to appreciate tlie importance of increasing the national defences; (4) the maladministration of Korea; (5) failure of foreign policy, especially as affecting the Shantung settlement.   Baron Kato declared that Japan had been placeds-1-2G-3!) c
sn a position dependent upon Great Britain and the United States. He&apos;dealt with the resolution of the Anglo-American Association at Peking expressing sympathy with Chinese aspirations which he thought Avas a threat to the peace of the Par East, and demanded Government action in the matter.MEXICO.Revolutionary Activity. Mr. Cummins reports that rebel forces have occupied, sacked, aud evacuated Minaullan, causing a loss to the Mexican Eagle Oil Company of $-10,000.   Government troops are again in possession of the town (July 12th).NETHERLANDS.Tlie ex-Kaiser. The Dutch Government has sent the following reply to the Allied Note relating to the safe custody of the ex-Kaiser: &quot;The Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs has received from the French Charge d&apos;Affaires a communication addressed to the Royal Government by the Allied and Associated Powers relative to the case of the ex-Emperor and ex-Prince Imperial of Germany.&quot;This communication, which according tc its terms is only based upon rumours, contains an admonition to a neutral and friendly Government which has painfully surprised the Royal Government.&quot; The Royal Government is conscious of its international obligations ; it is also conscious of not having failed to fulfil them.&quot;As regards the case raised in the communication of the Powers it must reserve to itself the free exercise of its sovereignty as regards rights which appertain to it and duties which are incumbent upon it&quot; (Mr. Robertson, July 10th).PERU.Constitutional Reform. President Leguia has issued a proclamation providing for the following constitutional reforms which will be submitted to a plebiscite:  (1) Both Houses to be re-elected every live years ; (2) the Presidential term to coincide with that of the Legislature ; (3) the President to be elected by the direct vote of the people ; (-1) Congress to be composed of 35 Senators aud 110 Deputies ; (5) no Congressman may hold any .other official post ; (0) reform of the judicature ; (7) progressive income-tax; compulsory arbitration in disputes between capital and labour (Mr. Manners, July Ilth).SWEDEN.Labour Unrest. The printers&apos; strike is regarded as serious by Bourgeois news-papers, which are convinced that the Bolsheviks are behind the movement. The extreme Socialists now dominate the Typographers&apos; Association. The moderate Socialist Press has accepted the workmen&apos;s terms. The Politiken represents the typographers&apos; victory as the victory of the entire working classes and declares that the strike is the first step in the general struggle, of Labour against Capital.In Stockholm aud Gothenburg the extremists have gained a majority- of votes in the elections for the metal-workers&apos; Congress.Engineers at the extensive works at Malmo are on strike and have committed acts of sabotage.The Stockholm police are agitating for higher pay and threaten &quot; strong action &quot; (Mr. Ramsay, loth July).THE UNITED STATES.Irish Agitation. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Washington states that the Irish agitators, though acting with vigour, have failed to secure the support of influential men, the resolution in the Senate being mainly a political manoeuvre. The moderates who include not only unbiassed Americans but also those Irish-Americans who disapprove of the Sinn Fein, programme of complete independence,
