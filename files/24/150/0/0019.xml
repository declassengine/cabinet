WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Bolshevism. An Admiralty Memorandum (No. 38(5) on the International situation contains a summary of the principles laid down by M. Lenin in a recent publication, which gives in condensed form the political faith of the Bolshevik.Demobilisation. According to the report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending March 20th (G-.T. 704-3), the total number demobilised from His Majesty&apos;s Forces up to March 20th amounts to approximately 2,219,000, of whom a little over 63,000 are officers. There remain to be demobilised from the Army and the Royal Air Force about 962,000, of whonr 75,000 are officers.Relaxation of Trade Restrictions. Mr. Balfour reports (March 2Sth) that at a meeting between the Second Delegates of the five Powers, the following resolutions were adopted : (1) Dsihonia. That reasonable quantities of commodities into Esthonia be allowed subject to necessary guarantees against re-export to Germany and Bolshevik Russia.(2) German-Austria. That all blockade and trade restrictions with German-Austria shall be abolished, and that commerce shall be free with all parts thereof as soon as the necessary machinery of control against the re-exportation to Germany shall be set up.(3) Poland. That blockade and trade restrictions with Poland be abolished, and all commerce be free with all parts thereof from April 1st, 1919, provided that satis-factory machinery be set up before that date for the proper control of Danzig.(4) Rhine. That, subject to the approval of the military authorities, there is no objection from a blockade point of view to allowing the re-opening of the Rhine to traffic for the purpose of permitting the resumption of Swiss trade with Holland, Scandinavia and the Entente countries, which trade, however, is to be subject to the existing blockade arrangements.Blacklisting.-Mr. Balfour states (March 25th) that immediate announcement is being made by the Associated Governments that no firm in any neutral country will in the future incur the penalty of blacklisting because it has (a) exported foodstuffs to Germany within the limits approved by and in accordance with the regulations of the Associated Governments ; (b) afforded credits to Germany for the purchase of such foodstuffs ; (c) imported goods permitted by the Associated Governments to be exported from Germany.ALLIED  GROUP.BELGIUM.War Losses&apos; Compensation. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Brussels gives (March 31st) the substance of a conversation he has had with the Belgian Prime Minister on the subject of the benefits which will accrue to Belgium as a result of the Peace Conference. The Prime Minister said that the Conference was drawing to a close and recent news from Paris had caused him the gravest apprehension, for it seemed as though Belgium had been abandoned by her Allies, tie indicated the points, on which he hoped his country would receive help and support from His Majesty&apos;s Government.
BRAZIL.Shipments to Scandinavia. The Foreign Office has notified His Majesty&apos;s repre-sentative in Brazil of the scheme which lias been devised by the Allied Blockade Committee in modification of the present system of advanced bookings for shipments to Scandinavia.CHINA. .Repatriation of Chinese Coolies. The Chinese Government is said to be willing that the coolies should return from Russia (see Reports Nos. 110 and 111). Lord Reading is informed that the request for their repatriation from the Union of Chinese workmen is part of a plan for promoting an armed uprising of Bolsheviks in Siberia. In the opinion of the United States Minister at Peking, Bolshevik propaganda would find little material in China to work on, as social or class distinctions do not exist. Sir J. Jordan, however, agrees with the War Office that it is highly undesirable to give any opening for Bolshevik propaganda in Eastern Asia, and states (March 25th) that he has repeatedly drawn the attention of the Chinese Government to the activities of Bolshevik agents in Chinese Turkestan.FRANCE.Press Articles. In an article on the Russian situation, Temps (March 28th) observed that there are only two possible policies vis-a-vis Russia, either to treat or not to treat with the Bolsheviks. It is strongly opposed to the first solution, chiefly because thereby Bolshevik autocracy would at once become all-powerful, and insists that there should be no negotiating with Bolsheviks. Temps urges that the Associated Governments are bound not to desert their Allies in Central Europe.Lord Derby draws attention to an article in Journal des Debats urging that before demobilisation is complete, the Allies should form a volunteer corps to meet such situations as have arisen in Hungary (March 24th).Several French newspapers (March 28th) refer to Mr. Lloyd George;s protest at the Peace Conference against the indiscretions of the French Press.Meeting of Tiailwaymen s Union. Sir G. Grahame reported (March 28th) that a meeting was held the previous day at Marseilles, of the P.L.M. Railwaymen&apos;s Union, representing some sixty thousand members. The Secretary-General of the National Railwaymen&apos;s Federation stated that his union would not start a partial strike, but, in agreement with the General Labour Confederation, would organise a general movement when the time came, without allowing themselves to be carried away by any premature impatience, however legitimate. He was supported in this line by the representatives of other railway unions.Command of Allied Troops in. Hungary and Rumania. The former Rumanian Commander-in-Chief, General lliesco, stated, in the course of an interview published in Petit Parisien, that the French Government intended to appoint General Man gin to command Allied troops in Hungary and Rumania, but denied that the appointment was made at his instigation. He admitted, however, that about six months ago he had submitted a scheme for the constitution of a Rumanian-Polish front under the supreme command of a great French leader (Sir G. Grahame, March 29th).The Acquittal of Villain. Sir G. Grahame (March 30th) is of the opinion that the acquittal of Villain, the murderer of Jaures, has occurred at an unfortunate moment, as there are Socialists in France who are genuinely Bolshevik in tendency and who will know how to make good use of this incident to inflame the wage earners against the present constitution of society. Certain leading Socialists depict the acquittal as a provocation to the socialist and working classes on the part of their bourgeois enemies.GREECE.Suspension of Demobilisation. Sir G. Grahame (Paris) reports (March 30th) that as a result of ,the present situation, the demobilisation and despatch to the Islands of the Greek Army Corps of National Defence are temporarily suspended,, and the Corps is being retained in the eastern part of Greek Macedonia.
ITALY.Italian propaganda. The Foreign Office has asked Sir R. Rodd to make inquiries concerning three alleged Italian subjects who, it is assumed, are coming to England for Italian propaganda purposes.Food Shortage;. Sir R. Rodd is informed (March 29th) that, owing to a shortage of wheat, the quality of bread is to be reduced by the addition of maize flour.Blockade of Adriatic Coast. Sir R. Rodd states (March 30th) that the naval blockade in the Adriatic is raised as from midnight March 30th.JAPAN.Press Campaign against America and Britain. Sir C. Greene reports (March 30th) attacks in the Press against America and, to a less degree, Great Britain, which he ascribes to militarist circles. The chief items singled out for attack are the League of Nations, self-determination, abolition of conscription, racial discrimination, and tire future of German islands. The main indictment, says Sir 0. Greene, appears to be concentrated upon activities-attributed to America in China, and he thinks that the General Staff has initiated the campaign with a view to creating an atmosphere of suspicion and hostility against America with the object of giving the country the idea that if conscription were abolished Japan would be left defenceless against America, possibly supported by Great Britain.Delegation to Germany. The Japanese Press of March 22nd announces the appointment of six military officers to proceed to Germany to investigate the probable future status of that country, whether as a democratic nation or as a resuscitated autocratic military power (Sir C. Greene, March 30th;.PORTUGAL;Ministerial Crisis. Sir L. Carnegie reported (March 29th) that the Government had resigned, and on March 31st that a new Ministry had been formed by the Minister of Instruction in the late Government, composed of representatives of all Pepublican parties.   The new Minister for Foreign Affairs is Doctor Xavier Da Silva.SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Italian Minister at Belgrade. Sir C. des Graz reports (March 17th, received March 20th) that the Italian Minister presented his letter of credence a second time, but the President of Council refused to accept it owing to its wording (see Report No. Ill, page 4). Prince Borghese thereupon left for Budapest, informing several people that he was going on leave.Serbia. Sir 0. des Graz learns (March 18th, received March 20th) that M. Nichol Gavrilovitch, new Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs, is being proposed as the new Minister in London. He is said to be one of the best men Serbia has, is very friendly to England and speaks English.The Foreign Office has instructed Sir C. des Graz (March 30th) to inform the -Serbian Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government have learned with great surprise of the arrest of Captain R. H. Broclie who had been despatched by General Phillips from Scutari to Southern Montenegro. His Majesty&apos;s Government reserve their attitude until a report has&apos; been received from Captain Brodie who has been, summoned to London. Sir 0. des Graz is also to ask the Serbian Government for an explanation of the firing at and wounding of an Englishman named Eden who was travelling with Prince Bis Doda when latter was assassinated.Fiume. Sir R. Rodd reports (March 29th) a widely circulated rumour that a British Navigation Company has secured practically a monopoly of interests at Fiume in the event of its becoming Jugo-Slav, aud this is given as an explauation of the attacks in a section of the English Press against the claims of Italy. The Cunard Company is openly mentioned as the company referred to. Sir R. Rodd thinks it desirable that some denial should be given to the story.
UNITED STATES.Sale of Governmcnt-oirued Ships. His majesty&apos;s representative at New York forwards (March. 27th) Mr. Hurley&apos;s proposals relative to steel ships. He proposes that Government-owned ships, amounting at present to n50 vessels of 3/100,000 tons deadweight, he sold and operated by American citizens without restrictions, other than those provided in the Dill and that fixing the maximum freight-rate. The G\ mice  at which the ships will be sold to be that ruling in world markets.   Theconditions attached to the sale arc given in the telegram.Settlement of Accounts of Discharged Soldiers. Lord Reading states that His Majesty&apos;s Consulates are receiving numerous letters from discharged soldiers regarding the final settlement of their accounts, and asks what arrangements have been made by the War Office.Irish Questions. According to Lord Reading (March 29th), passports have been granted to Messrs. Walsh, Ryan and Edward F. Dunne, who will go to Paris to present the claims of Ireland to the Peace Conference as representatives of the Philadelphia Convention. The deputation expects to sail on April 2nd and to remain in France until Ire.land&apos;s case is fully determined.ENEMY GROUP.A USTRIA-H UNGARY.Hungary. News transmitted by the Korr Bureau, Budapest, on March 27th stales that tbe revolution is being carried out in exemplary order in the provinces of Hungary. The transfer of production from capitalist to socialist control is proceeding smoothly.According to a German Wireless report, the Hungarian revolution is considered in Vienna in the light of a national lather than a Bolshevik revolt against the terms demanded by the Allies. The Social Democrat and Communist Parties have united on the following basis : (1) Complete power to be given to the proletariat. (2) The proletariat is to be armed and the bourgeoisie disarmed. (3) An army of workmen is to be organised ; railways, &amp;c, are to be socialised. (4) Church and State are to be separated immediately.The following announcement appears in an Hungarian Wireless report of March 27th : At a conference of the whole of the representatives of the late Communist Party Bel a Kun submitted the following resolution : &quot; The representative Committee of the dissolved Hungarian Communist Party declares that it regards the party as completely dissolved, and that any person who initiates any undertaking or does any act in the name of the Communist Party is a deceiver and enemy of the interests of the proletariat.&quot; This resolution was unanimously adopted, and thereby the Communistic Party is definitely merged in a United Hungarian Proletarian Party, which is designated as Socialistic.The Ivorr Bureau states that in the establishment of a Provisional Administration and Suffrage, the Russian example will for the most part be followed. The Village Council will look after the country people&apos;s affairs and the Town Council those of the townspeople. Councils for the districts and counties will be formed from the delegates of Village and Town Councils, and from the Town and County Delegates will be formed the National Assembly of Councils. This National Assembly of Councils will be the legislative body of the Hungarian Soviet Republic.The right to elect and to be elected is granted to all men and women over IS years of age who earn their living by work useful to the community. Soldiers of the &quot; Red &quot; Army and foreigners engaged in work useful to the community have also the right to vote.Everyone is precluded from participation in State business who refuses to adapt himself to this new order and wishes to live without working.   Therefore no vote is7786-la n
granted to those who employ hired labourers for profit, or to those who live on their income without work, nor to merchants, monks, the feeble-minded and those who have been deprived by the Courts of their political rights (Budapest, March 29th).Ordinances have been passed for the control by workmen of industrial and mining undertakings and communications, for the nationalisation of housing, and for compulsory work and the right to work (Budapest, March 26th).A decree has been issued for the organisation of a Red Army *&apos; to defend the interests of the proletariat against all.internal and external enemies and to fight for the freedom of the proletariat of the whole world.&quot; Revolutionary tribunals are also being formed (Budapest, March 27th.)It is denied that war has been declared on Rumania and Serbia (Budapest, March 30th). Numerous congratulatory messages have passed between Budapest and Moscow.. In the opiuion of a reliable Hungarian authority the revolution is attributable to (I.) the alleged non-observance of the Armistice conditions by the Entente Powers, (2) Czech, Rumanian and Serbian aggression, (3) the consequent flight of population into towns, which became overcrowded, (-1) unemployment caused by Allied occupation of coal and mineral districts, (5) failure of the Entente to answer the Hungarian Governments Notes of protest, (6) the feeling that Hungary is to be allowed no voice in deciding the future frontiers of the country. The movement may therefore be considered a national rising to save the country&apos;s honour. If a statement were made to the effect that Hungarian delegates would receive a hearing at the Peace Conference, that the Armistice of Belgrade would be observed, and that foodstuffs and raw materials would he transported into Hungary, the Bourgeois and Socialist patriots would quickly separate from the Bolshevik minority (Air. Clive, March 26th.)Sir C. des Graz and Sir H. Rumbold have received information in support of the view that the rising is nationalist.The General Officer Commanding the French Army in Hungary reports that he has been informed by Bela Run that foreign missions are at liberty to leave the country when they wish to do so (Sir 0. des Graz, March 27th).German-Austria. According to Professor Lamasch, events in Hungary are likely to react on Vienna. He considers that the Austrian authorities should be warned that the supply of food by the Allies is dependent upon political stability, and suggests that the situation would be relieved by (1) a speedier and increased delivery of supplies, (2) raising of the blockade against Austria, (3) the settlement of frontier-disputes, (I) sharing of war debt by all States composing former Empire, (5) occupation of Austrian towns by other than Italian troops.He states that Vienna is in favour of union with Germany, but that the rest of the country is against it (Sir PI. Rumbold, March. 26th).His Majesty&apos;s representative at Prague has been informed that eventually it will be impossible to prevent the union if the desire for it proves durable. Discussions between the Czech and Swiss Governments, which are both directly concerned in this question, are suggested (Mr. Balfour, March 27th).Czech Occupation of Sudetenland.  Mr. Gosling (Prague) learns on reliable authority that Czech military and civil authorities have rendered the position of the population of Sudetenland unbearable by their oppressive acts, especially in Troppau and other towns.   President Masaryk has promised to make investigations.Slovakia. Martial law has been proclaimed and mobilisation ordered. Fears are entertained of Bolshevik outbreaks on the Hungarian frontier (Sir H. Rumbold, March 30th).Russian Relations. Articles, which probably reflect the opinion of the Czech Government, have appeared in the Bohemian Press to the effect the Czecho-Slovak Republic and Jugo-Slavia cannot remain permanently without Russian help. The re-establishment of Russia is therefore considered essential (Mr. Gosling, March 25th).German Silesia. With regard to the independence of German Silesia (vide Report No. 112, p. 4), President Masaryk informed Mr. Gosling (March 24th) that the Czecho-Slovak Government favoured Prince Henry of Pless&apos;s proposals provided the movement was supported by the majority of German Silesians, and provided the form of government was Republican. The Czech-Slovak Government would not, however, take an active part in the movement for fear of arousing Polish resentment.
GERMANY.Reactionary Meetings. According to a German Wireless report of March 20th demonstrations took place on March 23rd in favour of the ex-Kaiser and General Ludendorff. The former German National Anthem was sung. The occasion is seized to launch the usual attacks against the Entente, who are accused of throwing the bourgeoisie into the arms of the reactionaries by their harsh peace terms.Political Situation. The British Red Cross representative, Mr. Abrahamson, has had a conversation with Count Brockdorff-Rantzau, in which the latter stated that if the peace terms of the Allies proved so severe as to crush Germany the German Government would refuse to accept them. The Sparlacists would then gradually gain control and would attempt to infect enemy and neutral countries with Bolshevik doctrines. The payment of indemnities would be thus avoided, while coercion in the shape of the reimposition of the Blockade would be counteracted by a rapprochement with Russia (Sir 0. Marling, March 30th).Sir C. Marling (Copenhagen) learns that further disorders in the near future are anticipated in Berlin. The German Government is stated to be suffering from nervousness and irresolution.Strikes. Strikes are threatened for April 1st, especially in the Ruhr District and at Essen. In the former the Government has resolved to proclaim a state of siege, and troops have been despatched to protect life and property. &quot;The nation must not be terrorised by one province and one class. Everything for the man who works now, nothing for the man who strikes.&quot; At Essen the strikers demand immediate intro-duction of a 6-hour shift without reduction of wages, au increase of 25 per cent, in wages, recognition of the Council system, carrying out of the so-called Hamburg points in connection with communal authority, release of political prisoners, establishment of a revolutionary Workmens Guard, and disbandment of Volunteer Corps, alliance with Russia in political and economic matters, disarmament of police, and payment of strikers.Disorders in Germany. Attention is drawn to a Memorandum (G.T. 7038) on disorders in Germany issued by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office. The enmity of the extremists to the Government is ascribed to (1) the belief that the real objects of the revolution have been sacrificed. Proletarian dictatorship and the socialisation of all instruments of production are demanded. (2) The coalition between the Majority Socialists and Radical Democrats and Catholic Centre, which means a strong infusion of the bourgeois element in the Government. (3) Economic distress. A succinct account is given of the Spartacist risings in various parts of Germany, details of which have appeared in previous General and Western Reports. These disorders have been put down by the Government chiefly through the firmness of herr Noske, but the author of the Memorandum is unable to say whether the danger of Spartacism in Berlin and throughout Germany has been finally arrested. The general Socialisation Bill and the Coal-Industry Bill passed by the National Assembly in the second week of March are mild when compared with the demands of the extremists which include the socialisation of all capitalistic enterprises, together with large estates and forests, the recprisition of all unused dwellings, the confiscation of fortunes made during the war and the imposition of heavy taxes on all large fortunes, the extension of the system of Workmen^ Councils and their recognition in the Constitution as administrative and legislative bodies, the election of judges and administrative authorities by the people, and the immediate resumption of diplomatic relations with the Russian Soviet Republic and Poland.Russian Relations. The following announcement is made in a German Wireless report (April 1st): &quot;The general uncertainty of obtaining just terms of peace is causing Germany to consider the state of relations between herself and Russia. Public opinion would not comprehend that, in the establishment of political and economic relations with Russia, Germany should allow herself to be outstripped by the Entente States. No.one in Germany wishes to join Russia in an armed alliance against the Western Powers. Even the Independent Social. Democratic leaders are opposed to such a policy which would place Germany under the military protection of Russia. They also object, in accordance with Lenin&apos;s own statements, to applying the principles of Russian Bolshevism directly to GermanyPoland. It is stated in the German Wireless report of April 1st that Germany is ready to accept pledges which are sufficient to counterbalance the political and
economic objections to taking a Polish army through Danzig. On the other hand Germany will take Foch&apos;s offers in the Danzig question as a forecast of what consideration Germany may expect in the matter of peace terms. The Cabinet has resolved to call the party leaders of the National Assembly to Berlin for April 2nd, in order to be able to consult with them on the question of the Danzig negotiations. This will assure complete agreement between the parties and the Cabinet.Three further classes are being called rip by compulsion for military service in the insurrectionary (*.e., Polish) area of the Province of Posen.NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.The Port Strike.-A further decree has been issued placing the river and coasting-services under official control. The crews are being granted back pay for February by the Argentine Government (Sir R. Tower, March 29th). The question of diverting shipping from Buenos Aires to some other South American port until such time as the exercise of the boycott is abandoned or forbidden is under discussion (March 26th. 27th, 28th).The Elections. The elections took place on March 23rd. So far the returns are favourable for the Socialist Party (Sir R. Tower, March 28th).Wireless Station. Sir R. Tower has been informed by the Minister of Marine that the President has signed a decree granting a concession to a German Company for erecting a wireless station.BALTIC PROVINCES.Military Situation. (1) General. Mr. Watson (Libau) points out the necessity for permitting supplies to reach German troops operating against the Bolsheviks.According to the Minister of Defence of the Lettish Government there are some 200 Lettish soldiers at Archangel aud 500 at Odessa who have expressed a desire to return to Livonia in order to participate in operations against the Bolsheviks.(2) Livonia. According to official reports from Reval the Esthonians have had successes in the regions of Marienbufg and Pskov.(3) Gourland. The Bolsheviks have retreated east of Mitau.Political Situation. According to the British Agent at Libau the Germair Governor has drawn attention to the dangerous outbreak amongst the workmen of that town owing to a scarcity of food and the prevalence of high prices. Mr. Watson states that the situation will become critical unless supplies are received immediately from Copenhagen. In the event of the collapse of the Lettish Government the Germans would assume complete control (Sir C. Marling, March 29th).The Esthonian representative at Copenhagen has informed Sir C. Marling that owing to lack of food and money the morale of the troops is suffering and many Finnish volunteers have left the army. Uncertainty as to the attitude of the Entente .and fears of reaction in Germany are favouring local Bolshevism (March 27th).ECUADOR.Loan. Negotiations are being conducted for raising a British loan (Mr. Keyser, March 26th).MEXICO.Political Situation. There appears to be considerable dissatisfaction with Carranza&apos;s  Government.   In a revolutionary manifesto  which   has  been  widely
circulated, au attack is made upon. Carranza&apos;s pro-German attitude. In tlie Southern States the inhabitants are suffering severely from military and civil oppression and the hatred against the present regime is intense.Considerable discussion has been aroused by the announcement that only those nations which respect foreign rights aud properties will be admitted, to the League of Nations. There are signs that Carranza is changing his attitude with regard to the redress of British grievances (Mr. Cummins, March 29th and 3(Jth).NETHERLANDS.Bolshevism. His Majesty&apos;s representative at Rotterdam points out the danger of Bolshevik agents endeavouring to obtain passages to the United Kingdom as members oE ships&apos; crews (Mr. Maxse, March 28th).NORWAY.The Government. Though in a minority in face of a combination of other parties, the Government still remains in office as the Socialists refuse to join a Ooalition Government, while the Conservatives are not prepared to take office except in a coalition (Sir M. Findlay, March 28th).Trade with Germany. Sir M. Findlay learns that a statement has appeared in the Norwegian Press to the effect that the Allies will permit certain trading with Germany. The Americans are reported as being prepared to grant Germany large credits for the purchase of goods in the United States. Proposals are made for securing part of this trade for British capital with the aid of Scandinavian firms.SPAIN.Political Situation. A Memorandum (G.T. 7055) has been issued hy the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office dealing with the political situation in Spain. Four problems confront the Government: (1) The Ministerial situation. Since his resignation and resumption of office the. position of Count Romanones has been strengthened. On February 27th the sittings of the Cortes were suspended on account, according to the Royal Decree to Parliament, of the obstructive conduct of the deputies. (2) The Regionalist problem. The Government and the Mancomunidad schemes still remain before the country, but the question has been temporarily shelved. The most important differences between the two schemes are to be found in the Government proposal for a single Chamber and a Governor who has the power to suspend laws which he considers ultra vires, and the Mancomunidad demand for a bicameral legislature and a Governor with the position of a constitutional sovereign. According to this scheme, the Catalan legislature is to have all powers not expressly reserved to the central authority. It is probable that Senor Cambo, who belongs to the wealthy commercial section of the Regionalist Party, is not averse to the question being shelved since his position has been rendered difficult by the demands of the Extreme Left. (3) The problem of Morocco. Count Romanones insists upon the maintenance of the status quo ante helium, that is the Spanish zone in its integrity for Spain, and Tangier, if not under Spanish, at least under inter-national control. France has admitted the right of Spain to be consulted and will probably confine herself to getting rid of the Algeciras Act, while Spain has appointed a Francophil governor over her zone. The way seems open for a conciliatory policy. The Gibraltar agitation has collapsed. (1) Labour unrest. The Syndicalists appear to have won a complete victory at Barcelona and the result of their victory remains to be seen. &apos;0f better augury is the downfall of the oppressive cacique system in Granada and the excellent behaviour of the troops during the recent disorders.Labour Unrest. The following telegram (March 31st) has been received from Sir A. Hardinge: &quot;The internal situation is improving everywhere, including Barcelona. Strikes and other troubles are fast subsiding. The &apos; Red Censorship,&apos; by which syndicalists succeeded for a day in preventing the publication in the Madrid Press of anti-revolutionary opinions or intelligence, collapsed.&quot; On the restoration now expected shortly of normal conditions, the formation of. a new Government to pass the Budget and dissolve Parliament is contemplated.&quot;7786-1!) c
SWITZERLAND.Coal Supplies. Sir PL Rumbold has been authorised to inform the Swiss Government that, subject to home and Allied requirements, His Majesty&apos;s Government is ready at once to facilitate as far as possible the transport of 30,000 to 40,000 tons of coal a month to Switzerland from Great Britain via the Rhine.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.(N.B.

The moral victory of the policy would be a just League of Nations in which each nation is prepared to discuss its individual wishes in a conciliatory manner with every other nation. One could not bend to the dictates of the victor, but only to an impartial verdict and that was why he thought he could not depart from the Wilsonian points, whereto belonged in the very forefront the siibmission of differences to a neutral court of arbitration and also the renunciation of armaments such as would permit of neighbours springing at each others&apos; throats. German sovereignty was prepared for this limitation provided that our present enemies and future neighbours were subject to the same limitations. In a League of Nations in which Germany would exclusively be the&apos;object of the executive, she would not be able to enter.
