WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.GENERAL.Economic Co-operation. Proposals have heen put forward for the reteution of some form of international consultation in economic matters pending the establish-in ent of the League of Nations (G.T. 7613).THE BALTIC PROVINCES.Political Situation. An armistice has been concluded between the Esthonians on the one hand and the Landwehr and the troops under German command on the other. According to its terms (1) hostilities were to cease hy land, sea and air by noon on July 3rd ; (2) all German forces to evacuate Latvia as soon as possible and not to make any forward movement except against Soviet troops ; (3) all German officers and troops to leave Riga by July 5th ; (-1) the Landwehr to leave Riga and withdraw behind the River Dvina hy July 5th ; (5) the Esthonians not to advance beyond the position occupied by them on July 3rd; (6) free communication to be opened by the Germans between Riga and Libau; (7) Allied governors to assume temporarily the administration of Riga in co-operation with the Lettish authorities ; (8) other details to be settled under the direction of the Allied Mission (Mr. Bosauquet, July 3rd).On July 6th Colonel Tallents reported that all Riga east of the Dvina was clear of the Germans and that he had re-established the Town Council. On the 7th the Lettish Government was reported by Mr. Grant Watson to be on its way to Riga. In order to improve Russo-Lettish relations negotiations were on foot to offer the post of Minister of Commerce to a Russian. The Government was meeting with some opposition from the Socialists and was itself unwilling to co-operate with the Baits.A Copenhagen telegram (July 4th) states that General von der Goltz with his Stall has arrived at Mitau.Mr. Grant Watson recommends that the blockade of Lettish ports should be raised (July Sth).The Northern Corps, General Gough reports (July 4th) that the Northern Corps is in a desperate condition owing to the lack of stores and ammunition. A Copen-hagen telegram (published in The Times of July Sth) announces the loss of Krasnaia Gorka, Koporva and several stations on the Petrograd-Narva railway west of Gratchina.Forests in Latvia. The Lettish Government has taken absolute possession of all the forests, covering roughly 1,300,000 acres of land, formerly belonging to the Russian Crown.CHINA. .The Peace Treaty. The Minister for Foreign Affairs officially informed Sir J. Jordan that the Chinese delegates at the Peace Conference had been instructed to sign the Treaty and that, as a consequence of their refusal to do so, he had resigned office. Sir J&apos;. Jordan reports that the military party under the leadership of Tuan Chi Jui still appears to favour signature, but that public opinion overwhelmingly approves the action of the delegates. The strikes have terminated, but the Japanese bovcott continues and the temper of the country is not reassuring.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.Political Situation. The following is the gist of a despatch dated June 23rd which has been received from His Majesty&apos;s representative at Prague. There is a regrettable lack of cohesion between the component parts of the Czecho-Slovak Republic, and, in spite of the fact that the behaviour of Czech officials and soldiers
has perceptibly improved in German Bohemia, the Czechs have succeeded in hostilising not only their former enemies the German Bohemians, but also the Moravians and Slovaks. In Moravia high-handed methods and religious intolerance has strengthened the party in favour of autonomy. In Slovakia a really grave situation prevails, for the inhabitants of the towns are in practically open sympathy with the Magyars, while the peasants regard the Czechs with but scant affection, and merely desire to be left alone to pursue their agricultural avocations. Like the Moravians, they view with apprehension the clerical intolerance of -the Czechs, and their desire for autonomy is almost universal. The Jews in Bohemia appear to be on the whole a law-abiding people, and have been given fair treatment by the Government, though the Czechs are extremely hostile to them. In Slovakia the Jews constitute a much less desirable element, and are to a great extent imbued with Bolshevism. Upon the creation of the Republic a considerable number of the old Czech nobility who have Nationalist traditions were prepared to give their services to the Republic, but the President was too apprehensive of public opinion to risk the experiment of giving them employment. This and the fact that their houses and goods are being sequestrated has produced great dissatisfaction among the members of the aristocracy.In spite of his distinction and personal charm, President Masaryk lacks the broad and generous outlook on life and the spirit of justice and toleration that might be expected of him. His Ministers are generally ignorant and narrow-minded, and have lost the confidence of the public.FINLAND.intervention in Russia. general Gough reports a change in the political situation as affecting Finnish intervention in Russia. The Government has come to terms with General Yudenich and there is complete accord between General Mannerheim and the Cabinet. Meanwhile, the retreat of the Northern Corps and the Bolshevik successes in the Olonetz region threaten the safety not only of Finland, but of the whole of that corner of Europe. General Gough therefore strongly urges the grant of a substantial loan, which Finland requires.FRANCE.A Twenty-jour Tlourn Strike. The Confederation Generale du Travail has decided to arrange a general twenty-four hours&apos; strike on July 21st, to coincide with similar airangements made by British and Italian Labour organisations. The Confederation Generale du Travail will make an energetic appeal to French workmen with a view to giving the widest extension possible to this demonstration.The objects of the demonstration are to bring about (1) the cessation of all armed intervention in Russia; (2) speedy aud absolute demobilisation; (3) the re-establishment of constitutional liberties; (4) a full and complete amnesty ; and (5) above all, a reduction in the high cost of living by all possible means (Lord Derby, July 4th).&quot; Humanite&quot; on tlie Peace. The following article by M. Marcel Cachin in Humanite illustrates the Socialist point of view on the peace terms :--;&apos; More than five years of war have ruined the old world; they have thrown out of gear the bourgeois society which has lasted for more than a century. The normal evolution of capitalism would in any case have ended in Socialism, but the inter-intermediary period has been shortened by the war, and the working classes must prepare to.assume their historic mission in the years now coming. The bourgeois State is not in a position to establish peace in a manner which the modern conscience of the peoples imperiously demands. The peace which will be signed how is not a durable one. It is poisoned by all the vices of a world which is disappearing. The capitalists who direct affairs have negotiated in the interests of themselves and of their class. They have come into collision at one and the same time with the actual conditions of international life and the sentiments of justice of the proletariat everywhere, which alone represents the future. An issue cannot be found to the financial situation of the great European nations, and no financial technician, however experienced, how-ever subtle, can find such an issue. All the augurs of the bourgeoisie bend over the sick budgets in vain.    The charlatans of nationalism promised the ignorant and
simple that the spoils of the enemy would suffice to fill &quot;the public coffers. Any serious man shrugs his shoulders at such promises. The working men of all countries, those of the victorious as well as those of the defeated countries, demand new conditions of life. There are great strikes everywhere : in America, Canada, Italy, France, Belgium, and even in neutral countries. The world is shaken to its foundations. The soldiers and sailors, freed from service too tardily, return to civil life, bringing with them a real spirit of revolt against militarism and the old formulas of passive obedience. They find at home uncertainty and disquietude about the economic situation, which offers no security for the future ; they come into contact with shameless commercialism, and find-a prodigious disorder in the distribution of goods and prices which render existence impossible. The Socialists, who point out these evident facts, are accused of being bad Frenchmen paid by the enemy. They put on one side, with a contempt which they merit, these criminal accusations, and they devote themselves, as must all working men, to the task of positive recon-struction which will be urgently necessary when the working classes shall have received the heritage which has come to them in such tragic conditions.&quot;Trade with Germany. Lord Derby forwards a Memorandum on the possible trade relations between France and Germany in the near future. The writer first draws attention to an article in the Matin by M. Bouilloux Lafont, in which the latter states that French importations into the territories on the left bank of the rhine have already reached the figure of 500,000,000 francs, and urges that France should organise an exchange of goods with these regions and freely admit their importations.The writer of the Memorandum fears that France may, in the near future, find it to her advantage to trade more particularly with Germany than with other countries. There is a tendency in France to continue the old misunderstanding of dividing-Germany up into Prussian and non-Prussian countries, and to imagine that the latter are naturally drawn towards France by affection and historical ties. Thus extensive trade relations between various parts of Germany and France may be justified by the argument that these parts of Germany are not Prussia. Germany may therefore become Great Britain&apos;s chief competitor in France. Moreover, the unfavourable rate of German exchange, which means that German imports will be sold at prices, when translated into the currency of the importing country, .far below the imports of other countries, will-militate in favour of Germany.GERMANY.The Peace Terms. The Berlin representatives of the United Press put the following questions to Dr. Bell, the Minister of Communications : -(1) AYill Germany, after signing the Peace Treaty without r eservation, proceed to cany it out ?(2) Will Germany surrender the Kaiser and Superior Officers ?(3) What will Germany do about the Poles and military measures in Poland ?The Minister replied : (1) We will honour our signature ; Germany will make every effort to carry-out the Peace Treaty. (2) We believe the Entente will discover the necessity of altering such of the peace conditions in their own interest as they recognise are impossible of fulfilment; we believe the Entente will not insist upon the surrender of the Kaiser and Superior Officers. (3) The Empire will in no case support war against the Poles.(Nauen, July 2nd.)The Political Situation. (1) General. According to a wireless report of July 2nd, the Majority Socialist and Centre Party Government is confronted with a trial of strength against the influence of Communism. Many of the organisations participating in the present strikes declare that they are determined on the destruction of the Government and the institution of a proletariat dictatorship.Sir W. Townley learns from the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs that all the signs indicate the outbreak of a revolutionary movement in Germany at an early date. In Dr. van Karneebek&apos;s opinion the revolution would be followed either by a Communist Government or by a military dictatorship. If the former came first, he thought it would be speedily succeeded by the latter, which would eventually give place to the re-establishment of monarchical institutions on a constitutional basis.
[Tlie following notes are derived from the German Press of the end of June.](2) Prussia. Food riots broke out at Gassel on June 21st. Food shops and clothing warehouses were looted. Attempts to storm tho prison and police, station failed. A state of siege w;ts proclaimed. On June 25th food riots broke out at Frankftirt-on-Oder, and had to be suppressed by.Government troops.(3) Brunswick. Smuggling of arms is being carried out on a large scale.(-1) Saxony. The elections to the new Workers&apos; Council, in place of that suppressed by General -Marker, at Leipzig, resulted in a victory for the Independents, who obtained 101 seats out of a total of 300. -11 were obtained by the Majority Socialists and 18 by the Democrats.(5) Hamburg: The disturbances were described last week. Tho situation is apparently unchanged.(6) Mannheim. Food riots occurred on June 21st.The Strikes. The situation remains unchanged. The stoppage continues on railways, trams, and omnibuses. The food supply of Berlin is imperilled through lack of transport, and industry and electric works through coal shortage. llerrOser, the Minister of Railways, has issued a proclamation that, the Government is reducing the price of foodstuffs to flic lowest possible limit, and the democratisalion of railways is being carried out in accordance with the constitution of the Kmpiro and the resolution of the National Assembly. The proclamation continues: &quot;Though railway organ isa-tions declare that the present strike is not justified, it continues in spile of the fact that imports are held up and foodstuffs are being ruined. To avoid famine the Minister is compelled to enforce tho resumption of traffic with every means at his disposal. He therefore declares that all workmen who fail to resume work by July 13l.h, at latest, are dismissed; tho same applies to all officials who do not go back to their duties by that date. Care is being taken to preserve tbe working man&apos;s freedom in accordance with disciplinary measures.&quot;In spite of promises to resume work, the strikers are still idle. This is said to be due to Communist propaganda. The Executive Council of Workmeirs and Soldiers&apos; Councils have been equally unsuccessful in ending the strike. Meanwhile the move-men t is spreading to Frankfurt, Darmstadt, Maintz, and Hanover, and communication between the North and South of Germany is becoming increasingly difficult.The demands of the Dank employees were settled by arbitration on July 5th (Nauen, July 2nd to July Oth).Latest reports indicate some improvement in the situation, especially at Frankfort and Darmstadt.The Coal Supply. The business manager of the Mining Association in Essen has communicated tho following information concerning the effect of the peace conditions on the German coal, industry : &quot; Our stocks of coal were reduced by the peace conditions from 195 milliards of tons to 73 milliards of tons. The output of coal, which in 1913 amounted to 190 million tons, will in future only run to 91 millions, as 00 million tons have been lost through the cession of German territory alone and 43&apos;3 million tons must further, according to peace conditions, be handed over to the Allies. Whereas before the war 03 million tons were required by industry and trade, in diminished Germany there would in tho future be not morcth an 10 million available for these purposes.   We stand by the grave of our economic life &quot; (Nauen, July 3rd).Separatism. Tho Kblnische Zeitung (July 1st) publishes a resolution passed unanimously by the Advisory Council of the Rhenish Centre Party with reference to the Rhino Republic. The Party declares its intention of opposing any separatist attempts which may be made at this juncture, though such opposition does not imply a refusal to recognise the justice of such attempts on principle. Immediate action must be discouraged, it says, because it would be contrary to, party discipline, and would result in splitting the party and endangering its existence.&apos; Further, it would be most fatal for tho whole population of the Rhine land and for the Empire.GERMAN-AUSTRIA.Communism. A Vienna wireless report of July 5th contains the following information :  &quot; At the final meeting of the Congress of Workmen^ Councils of Austria, tho majority showed itself to bo clearly opposed to all Communist attempts.   As aS-126-2b u
counter-blow, the Vienna Communists have summoned for July Gth a congress of representatives of all their organisations ih Austria.&quot; The None &quot;Tag publishes a police report showing the close contact that exists between Hungarians in Vienna and Austrian Communists, which includes the sending of large sums of money from Budapest to Vienna, and the disbursement during April of 60,000,000 kronen by the Hungarian Legation in Vienna.&quot;Slgria. The German-Austrian Delegation has addressed a further note to the Allied and Associated Governments complaining of Jugo-Slav aggression in Southern Styria and requesting the occupation of the contested regions, and in particular the town of Marburg, by Entente troops.HUNGARY.Proposed Operations against the Bolsheviks. Sir C. des Graz reports that two members of the Hungarian anti-Bolshevik Ministry at Szegcdin, oh which Count Julius Xarolyi is the head, have paid a short visit to Belgrade. They gave a terrible account of the horrors of Bolshevism, which had been let loose in their country, and touched Tipon the policy of the Italian Government in its alleged support of the Bolshevik regime. They then informed Sir C. des Graz that they had come to Belgrade to enlist the sympathy of the Italian Government, and to obtain certain facilities of transit which would enable them to make a start in operations against the Bolsheviks. From Szegedin the difficulties were too great, whereas the country to the west of the Danube would be the most favourable &quot; jumping-off &quot; ground. To reach that from Szegedin, however, the use of the Serbian-Jugo-Slav railway by way of Szabatka and on was necessary. Though with conqjaratively few men at present, they hoped, and indeed appeared to count on a very considerable number of officers and men, now forced by circumstances and threats of odious reprisals against their families to serve in the Bolshevik ranks, coming forward to meet and join them.The Armistice with Czecho-Slovakia. A wireless message from Budapest, dated July Sth, gives details of the neutral zone established at the Conference between Hungarian and Czecho-Slovakian representatives at Pressburg. The boundaries of this zone are, roughly, 5 kilometres on either side of the line of demarcation as laid down in the Ententc&apos;s Note of June 13th. The administration of the zone will be assured by authorities of both nationalities. Points of difference will be settled by mixed Commissions.ITALY.Franco-Italian Conflict at Finnic. Sir R. Rodd reports that serious disturbances have broken out between French and Italians troops in Fiume as a result of which nine French soldiers were killed and several wounded. Reports indicate that the incidents were provoked by the Italians, but the Italian Press has published violent FrancophdWJ- articles on the subject. It is also slated that French soldiers have been attacked at Genoa and in other parts of Italy. Serious consequences are feared, as large numbers of French soldiers still remain in Italy.Food Flots. Sir R. Rodd reports that violent disturbances have broken out in Florence and in several cities of Romagna on account of the high price of food. After numerous shops had been looted the Prefect of Florence issued a decree requisitioning all foodstuffs, with the result that on July 5th the situation was reported to be calmer.In Rome suppliers and middlemen have decided to reduce by 25 per cent, the prices of foodstuffs, clothing, and all articles not qualified as luxuries. A further reduction is. expected. These measures are due to private initiative under apprehension of a serious popular outbreak.On July Sth the Minister of the Interior published a manifesto stating that a plot fostered by anarchists, who were taking advantage of the food situation, had been discovered. Their object was to take possession of the markets and chief points of the city and to terrorise the population by acts of violence. The manifesto states that the conspirators have been arrested (Sir R. Rodd, July Sth).Political Events. The Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Oflice has issued a Memorandum (G.T. 7621) on Italian affairs from March to June 191!). The Memorandum stales that so far from preparing public opinion for a realisation
of the  act that Italy would not obtain satisfaction for all her territorial claims, the Government permitted the conduct of active propaganda in Paris and. London, and made a strong effort to bring Italian public opinion itself to the point of demanding the satisfaction of very far-reaching claims. Before the publication of President Wilson&apos;s Memorandum, even friendly papers had begun to talk of Anglo-Saxon Imperialism, while Prance was reproached for her unwillingness to cede the port of Jibouti and her anxiety to promote a Danubian Confederation with the object of preventing German-Austria&apos;s adhesion to the German Empire. As a result of President Wilson&apos;s appeal this agitation was redoubled, and the country practically unanimously rallied to Signor Orlando. The Government now attempted to restrain the violent campaign against Great Britain and the United States, which they had originally promoted, with the result that a movement began for weakening Signor Orlando&apos;s position, by the Nationalists because he was considered to be too conciliating, by Signor Xitti because he considered the moment favourable for creating a coalition in his own support, and by the Giolittians because their leader thought the time ripe for effective intervention.From this time onwards there was increased evidence of a revival of pro-Germanism, pro-Magyarism, and even pro-Turkism in high Italian circles. For instance, Italian agents were stated to be treating with members of the Oommittee of Union and Progress ; the majority of the Press were sympathetic to Germany when the peace terms were published ; German commercial agents visited Northern Italian towns; there were several dealings in arms with the Hungarian Communists.During the same period the situation was complicated by a crisis in domestic affairs. The Executive of the Italian Socialist Party decided to adhere to the Third Communist Internationale, the direct outcome of which was a successful strike at Genoa with the object of preventing the despatch of munitions to Russia. There were large strikes in Naples, Milan, Biella, and Rome, and a general strike was only narrowly7 averted.   The causes were partly political, partly industrial and economic.The events immediately leading to the fall of Signor Orlando&apos;s Government have been described in previous Reports.The Memorandum ends : &quot;It may be remarked that already a strong opposition to the Government among the Interventionists has begun that is, among that group which was conspicuously anti-German from the beginning, and helped to nullify Giolittian influences in bringing Italy into the war: Whether this will be sufficient to counteract the clever Giolittian manoeuvring it is at present, impossible to say. We are in any case likely to see more efficient, though perhaps not more popular, domestic administration, but on the foreign side a purely opportunist policy, with a- definite orientation towards Germany should the allies not be able to secure some satisfaction of Italian territorial claims. The only practicable alternate to the Nitti-Tittoni Government a Luzzatti Cabinet seems out of the question for the moment.&quot;JAPAN.Future PoFiey.  On June 28th, Mr. Alston telegraphed the following-information : &quot; In an interview granted to the Press on June 26th, the Minister for Foreign Affairs is reported to have said that (1) negotiations between Japan and China for the restoration of Shantung will commence after the ratification of the Peace Treaty ; (2) international relations with Germany will begin to resume normal conditions about two months after the ratification, when negotiations for the conclusion of a commercial treaty will be started; (3) though owing to the establishment of the League of Nations some adjustment may perhaps be made in the provisions of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the alliance will remain unaltered.&quot;MEXICO.Revolutionary Activity. Mr. Cummins has received a report that rebel activity is increasing in the region of Puerto Mexico. The train service has been suspended and all telegraph lines across the isthmus cut.PERU.Political Situation, His Majesty&apos;s representative at Lima reports that the coup (Vital in favour of Senor Leguia has been successful. Sehor Leguia has proclaimed himself provisional President pending ratification by Congress of his claim that hes426-26 C
sreceived a majority of votes at the last election. He has appointed a Cabinet, and is supported hy the Army, the Administration, and the country generally, with the exception of a small but important section of the landed and financial classes.SOUTHERN SLAY STATES.Italo-Serbian Hostility. Sir C. des Graz has received an Aide Memoire from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that on June 1-lth the Italians demanded of the Serbian Commander at Klegne (south-west of Libra) the evacuation of that position. This was refused in the absence of superior orders, with the result that the Italians launched an attack, which was repeated on June 21st. The Italians are said to be concentrating seven or eight thousand men towards Klegue, and the Serbian Government considers that this concentration constitutes an immediate danger of conflict between the two armies.SPAIN.The Future of the Government. Writing on the eve of the meeting of the new Cortes, Sir A. Hardinge states that the political future is full of uncertainty. The optimist view is that as the Government possesses, with the support of the Dato Conser-vatives, a working majority in both Houses, it will he able to suppress obstruction, vote the budget in the course of the next few weeks and prorogue Parliament until October next. The pessimist view is that Count Romanones and the &quot; Reds,&quot; now united in an unholy alliance, will succeed in making business impossible by prolonging for an indefinite period the discussions on the address in reply to the Iving&apos;s speech. Sehor Cambio&apos;s Regionalists, the more conservative of whom have got over their fear of Bolshevism, are opposed to the Government, while Sehor Dato&apos;s supporters are not prepared to support Sehor Maura in any attempt to meet the Regionalists&apos; demands. Meanwhile, a movement has been initiated by Senor Salvador to effect the reunion of all the Monarchist Liberals against the common foe, though the Liberals have been discredited by the rivalry of Count Romanones, the Marcjuis of Alhucemas, and Sehor Alba, by the weakness of Count Romanones in dealing with the forces of disorder, and by the hostility of the army.According to Press reports the Opposition lost no time in attacking the Govern-ment on the manner in which the elections were conducted.The Speech from the Throne. The Speech deals with the following subjects:-(1) Foreign Relations. The state of concord with the Holy See, which is in accordance with the Catholic sentiments of the nation, is fully maintained. Peace is welcomed. (2) International Policy. In the future, the motives which governed Spanish international policy at the opening of the Cortes in 1907 will be the same as heretofore. (Commenting on this the pro-German Press defends SpaiiFs neutrality, but other papers point out that the declaration of international policy in 1907 has been reversed by this neutrality and by Seiior Maura&apos;s anti-Ally policy during the war.) Spain has declared her adherence in principle to the League of Nations. (3) Morocco. The pacification of Morocco has made good progress, and the Cortes will be asked to consider proposals tending to simplify the public services, to increase local revenue, and to alleviate the burden of the Treasury. (1) Economic and Social Legislation. Allusion is made to the prevailing unrest. Reforms include education, the land qimstion, housing, State charities, and national production. (5) Autonomy. A settlement is desired.SWEDEN. .Trade with Russia. On July 1st the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in an interview with Sir C. Kennard, enquired whether Great Britain was actually at war with Russia, and whether Swedish cargoes, consigned to the Soviet Government at Petrograd, would be permitted to reach Russia.   The enquiry was to be considered as formal.Strike of Printers. Sir C. Ivenuard reports that, owing to the printers&apos; strike, no daily papers were published on July 5th except the Social Democraten and the extreme Socialist Politiken. The former took the opportunity of carrying on propaganda for the Socialist Press, and the latter published an appeal to refuse once and for all to &quot; set out in print a single counter-revolutionary telegram or a single article hostile to the working classes.&quot;
The Aaland Islands. In its reply to the Finnish Note (see Report No. 125, page 9), the Swedish Government states that the Aaland Islands should lie reunited to Sweden on historical, racial and strategic grounds, and insists that the question can only be settled by a referendum according to the clearly expressed wishes of the inhabitants.SWITZERLAND.The League of Nations. Lord Acton reports that on the occasion of a cantonal festival in the Ticino, M. Motta, the Minister of Finance, delivered an address strongly advocating the adherence of Switzerland to the League of Nations.The President has again informed Lord Acton that he is convinced that Parliament will be favourable to Switzerland&apos;s entry into the League.Vorarlbevg. According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, if German-Austria declines to recognise the right of Vorarlberg to self-determination the Swiss Govern-ment will take no further interest in the question (Lord Acton, July 5th).Dr. Euder, who has been re-elected Landmann of Vorarlberg, has made a statement to the Diet, in which he said that Vorarlberg had temporarily joined Austria, but reserved the right of uniting with Switzerland or Germany.peace discussions.Handbooks -prepared in the Historical Section of the Foreign Of/ice.
