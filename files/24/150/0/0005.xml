WESTERN AND GENERAL REPORT.general.Repatriation of Prisoners. (1) Germany. Reports have been received to the effect that British prisoners of war in Germany are in danger of starvation, especially in the manufacturing centres. The camp at Cassel, where there are 1,000 prisoners, is given as an example. Sir W. Townley has been instructed to request the Netherlands Minister at Berlin to bring strong pressure to hear upon the German Government to find the necessary rolling stock to carry food from Holland and Denmark.It is reported that at the camp at Lechfelcl, when the former guard was relieved by some young volunteers, the latter fired on the prisoners, killing one Russian and wounding one American and two British prisoners. The Netherlands Minister is being asked to inquire into the incident. A small relief party under the Red Cross is being sent from Italy to Munich to obtain information about Bavarian camps and to arrange for their evacuation and relief.The British Government has decided to send ships to Hamburg and Bremerhaven for the transport of prisoners from those ports.The Foreign Office learns that many prisoners working on farms have not been informed of the armistice, in order that their labour may be retained by the farmers. The Foreign Office learns that there are still 300 British prisoners working in mines near Sagan. On December 18th the Inter-Departmental Committee on Prisoners of War issued a statement in which the number of repatriated prisoners from all enemy countries was given as -1,374 officers, 91,784 other ranks, and 3,4-19 civilians.On December 9th Mr. Abrahamson reported that the only camp entirety cleared was Ruhleben.The Netherlands Minister at Berlin has been requested to inform all British prisoners in Germany that His Majesty&apos;s Government is doing everything in its power to expedite their repatriation, but that the claims of the Allies with regard to their prisoners and the limited number of ships at its disposal must cause some delay. Speedy repatriation can best be assured by the maintenance of strict discipline and control of food supplies.(2) Denmark. Owing to reports of the serious condition of prisoners in Germany and the fact that the Danish authorities are putting certain difficulties in the way of speedy repatriation, Lord Kilmarnock suggested on December 17th that the Allied Governments should request the Danish Government (1) to provide accommodation for 10,000 men, (2) to lend railway trucks for the transport of food to Germany, (3) to allow all Allied prisoners, with the exception of Russian prisoners, to pass the Danish frontier. Lord Kilmarnock thinks it would be necessary to make the supply of coal to Denmark dependent on the Governments compliance with these requests.(3) Switzerland. Sir H. Rumbold reported on December 14th that the German authorities were already evacuating British prisoners from camps in South Germany through Switzerland.Responsibility for the War. With reference to Dr. solf&apos;s proposal for the convocation of a neutral Commission for the purpose of establishing the responsibility for the war (vide also Report No. 98, page 4, under &quot;France&quot;), M. Pichon proposes to inform the Swiss Minister at Paris that the German note requires no reply, the responsibility for the war having long since been incontestably established by all the documents.German Mercantile Shipping. His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at Paris and Rome have been informed of the importance of obtaining immediate control and disposal, of
o Othe mercantile shipping of Germany by the Allies. This must he a matter of agree-ment, since there exists no relative provision in the Armistice. It is suggested that, while no definite terms can be laid down pending careful investigation, the German Government should be given to understand that the Allied Governments will furnish Germany with such supplies as they judge necessary. It is further stated that the use of this shipping cannot be confined to relieving Germany, and that its ultimate disposal as arranged by the terms of peace is not to he prejudiced by any intermediate action. The French and Italian Governments have been requested to instruct their representatives on the Naval Armistice Committee at Wilhelrashaven to urge Germany to place her mercantile shipping at die disposal of the Allies.allied  group.CHINA.Enemy Interests, Sir J. Jordan reports that though the Chinese Government is willing to intern undesirable enemy subjects, the process is slow owing to complete lack of organisation. It is not considered probable that any limited scheme of repatriation can result in the destruction of enemy influence. The Allied representatives at Peking have therefore decided to recommend to their respective Governments the repatriation of all undesirable enemy subjects, but wish to be assured that sufficient transport is available for the purpose before approaching the Chinese Government.CUBA.General Strike. Mr. Cowan (Havana) reported that a general strike was declared on December 10th, nominally in sympathy with the strike on the Cuba railroad, though the latter was settled on the same day. Mr. Cowan considered that the agitation was political in origin and directed against the Government. He drew attention to the serious effects which the strike might have on the sugar industry. On December 13th Mr. Cowan was able to report that, following upon a strongly-worded proclamation by the President of the Republic the strike Avas called off. lie fears, however, further labour trouble in the near future.FRANCE.President Wilson.-Lord Derby reports that President Wilson was received at Brest and Paris with great enthusiasm. Meanwhile the Socialist and Conservative Press publish articles illustrative of their respective attitudes towards him. The Temps declares that France shares with President Wilson the desire for a complete victory, and with him aims at a just peace. She now thinks only of repairing the past and ensuring the future, and this is the ideal of the President. The more incorrigible Germany shows herself, the more indispensable will be the League of Nations. Capus in an article in Figaro deplores the address presented to President Wilson by the Municipal Council of Brest and the speech delivered by the Socialist Mayor. He points out that no mention was made of victory. The cry of &quot; Long live Wilson,&quot; he declares, is a cry of victory, not of a cowardly compromise which, under the pretext of justice, would spare German people from punishment for its crimes and payment of its debts. M. Herve, in Victoire, calls upon French Socialists not to compromise President Wilson by seeking to monopolise him for themselves, and not to place him in an awkward position by giving him the&apos; impression that they like him in preference to the man whom the whole of France adores M. Clemenceau. The Socialist Deputy, Marcel Sembat, in an article in the Ileure, takes exception to
the speed with which the President was conducted through the town of Brest, and declares that the Government was responsible for this owing to the fact that Brest is Socialist. The President, he goes on to say, knows no French, hut he will, nevertheless, not trust Pichon and Clemenceau&apos;s translations. Another Socialist Deputy, Marcel Cachin, writing in Htimanite, comments on speeches delivered by M. Poincare and Mr. Wilson at the Elysee to the detriment of the former. He complains that the President of the French Republic made no definite mention of a League of Nations, declared that the future alliance of nations must exclusively comprise the Entente belligerents, and waived aside the popular hope that this- war would be the last. Mr. Wilson, on the other hand, was precise and firm on these capital points. The Confederation Generale du Travail have issued a manifesto to the Paris working-classes relative to the Governments refusal to allow a demonstration on the day of the Presidents arrival without his consent being asked for. The Committee considered that any such request would be discourteous to the President and therefore the demonstration has been cancelled.The Confecleratiou Genercde du Travail. The first Session of the Confederal National Council was held on December 15th for the purpose of &quot; modifying the constitution of the Confederation Generale du Travail in accordance with the present necessities of Trades Unionism in France, and of giving to its action all the strength and authority which it needs to undertake the extensive work which labour expects and circumstances demand and permit.&quot; Resolutions were passed sympathising with President Wilson&apos;s aims and demanding, inter alia, freedom to hold meetings, the liberty of the Press, amnesties, and, above all, representation of the working classes at the General Peace Conference.Alsace-Lorraine. Commenting on the opening words of President Poincare&apos;s speech at Strasbourg on December 9th, &quot; Le plebiscite est fait,&quot; the Temps says : &quot; If we do not wish any other plebiscite but this, it is not that we fear in any way the surprises of a ballot, but that we do not intend to subordinate to any discussion rights which are unconditional, imprescriptible, and sacred .... France, returning to the Rhine, again becomes the champion of liberty in Central Europe.&quot;The Rhine Provinces. M. Clemenceau has informed Lord Derby that the French Government does not meditate annexations on the left bank of the Rhine, with the possible exception of the Sarre valley, which was taken from France after the battle of Waterloo despite a protest from England. (In regard to the question of the coal resources of that district, vide Report No. 9S, p. 4.) M. Clemenceau, however, thought that the Rhiue was the natural frontier of Germany and that the provinces on the left bank should be constituted on a basis of guaranteed neutrality. Lord Derby thinks that the Socialists, though absolutely opposed to annexation, would support any measures for the establishment of an independent state as a &quot;barrier between France and Germany.ITALY.Occupation of Zara. Lord Derby reported on December 12th that the French Government was in agreement with the British Government as to the undesirability of Serbian troops being sent to Zara and other places affected by the Treaty of London. It also agrees that representations should be made to the Italian Government dissuading it from the occupation of Fiume to the exclusion of Serbian troops.Naval Command in the Adriatic. The Italian Minister of Marine has asked Sir R* Rodd whether Allied warships in the Adriatic are still under the Italian command. He asserted that French warships were being sent into the Adriatic without reference to the Italian command and that French ships were carrying-on propaganda and influencing the local population against Italy.The Ministry. The Minister of the Treasury informed Sir R. Rodd on December 16th that the Ministry would be reconstructed in the near future. The less energetic members of the Administration were to be replaced, and among these would be the Minister of War and possibly the Minister of Commerce.
PORTUGAL.Assassination of the President. Sir L. Carnegie reports that the President of the Republic was assassinated on the night of December 14th. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment has requested Sir L. Carnegie to express its sympathy. A Provisional Govern-ment has been formed with the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as President of the Council.Sir L. Carnegie reported on December 17th that Admiral Antunes, the late Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, had been elected President of the Republic by Congress.   The Ministry has resigned and a new one is in course of formation.SOUTHERN SLAV STATES.Italian Relations. According to a despatch received on November 2Gth from Sir H. Rumbold, Italian territorial claims were discussed at a conference of Serbs, Croats, and Jugo-Slavs at Geneva. It was pointed out that in Dahnatia and the islands the Jugo-Slav population numbered 600,000 against 15,000 Italians. There was a large Jugo-Slav majority at Fiume, if the suburb of Susak and the hinterland were included. A protest against the Italian civil and military occupation stated that the frontiers of the zone of occupation coincided with those traced by the Treaty of London of April 25th, 1915, a date at which the principle of national self-determination had not been officially recognised. The same despatch outlined the views of M. Stoyaovitch, the Jugo-Slav leader at Geneva. He inveighed against the Italian occupation of Fiume and Zara, but conceded that the Italians had a right to Trieste.The Foreign Office has informed Lord Derby that the Prince Regent of Serbia has represented to the British Government the grave situation which has been brought about by the action of Italy on the Western front of the new Jugo-Slav State, which, if the Italians persist in their present policy of encroachment, may lead to war.Sir C. des Graz learns through the French Government that the Italian Govern-ment has protested against the orders given by the National Council of Agram to the authorities at Spolato to the effect that they are to swear allegiance to the Jugo-Slav State, and to dismiss Italian officials in the event of their refusal. The French Government proposes to request the Serbian Government to inform the Jugo-Slav authorities that the legal status of Austria has not been affected by the armistice and that their action is against their own interests.The Future of Jugo-Slavia. Sir C. cles Graz learns that a single Parliamentary Government is to be formed in concert with the Crown Prince of Serbians Government for Serbia, Montenegro, and all the Jugo-Siav territories, with one sole national representation. On his journey through Herzegovina and Bosnia Sir G. des Graz noted the joy expressed by the people at the union with Serbia.Montenegro. -Sir C. des Graz has received an account of recent events in Monte-negro according to which the Deputies, after a general election, met at Podgoritza on November 24th. The following day they declared the reign of the Petrovitch dynasty at an end, A proclamation was issued announcing the union of Montenegro with Serbia.The Montenegrin Government at Paris has addressed an appeal to His Majesty&apos;s Government, in which it is stated that the will of the Montenegrin people has been misrepresented, It is the policy of the Government of Serbia to constitute Monte-negro into a Serbian province. The decisions of the Assembly convened at Podgoritza are illegal. Montenegro claims its independence and the withdrawal of Serbian troops.Macedonia. Sir H. Rumbold is informed that Serbia desires to annex that part of Macedonia formerly occupied by Bulgaria, which it claims is racially more Serbian than Bulgarian. It is only intended to claim a small strip of Bulgaria itself sufficient to enable Serbia to secure the railway along the Timok River.7001-36 a
UNITED STATES.Naval Policy. Gear-Admiral Badger, the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the General Navy Board, who appeared before the House Naval Affairs Committee, strongly urged that appropriations should be made for the purpose of building up a navy which would by 1925 be the equal of any other navy in the world. Inter-national policing under a League of Nations and the creation of a large United States mercantile marine, in his opinion, necessitated such a navy. He stated that the war had shown that the possession of a second best navy had proved valueless to Germany in time of war.Mr. Barclay reports that there is a growing feeling in the Navy Department that the United States Navy should be brought tip to the strength of the British Navy. Anti-British elements have used the opportunity to press their claims. Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Tail, &quot;on the other hand, supported by the Republican Press, declare that the United States should be content with the second place.The Irish Question. On November 12th Mr. Barclay forwarded to His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs a copy of an appeal made to President Wilson by the Archbishop and clergy of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco, from which the following is an extract : &quot;We petition His Excellency the President to use the unique position of the United States at this conjuncture to the end that the claims of Ireland to be a free and independent nation in the fellowship of nations shall be acknowledged by the United States ; and the place of Ireland .... may be assured by the influence of the United States in such a manner that Ireland may stand in equal condition with Poland and Serbia and all the wronged nations of the world.&quot; A copy of this petition was sent to all the dioceses of the United States with an appeal urging them to take similar action. Mr. Barclay looks upon this petition as an indication that there will shortly be a recrudescence of Irish agitation in the United States. He thinks that pressure will be brought to bear on the President by means of the Irish vote to induce him to raise the Irish question at the Peace Conference, and that the only way to avoid the appearance among the Irish population and the Catholic clergy of strong anti-British feeling would be to announce a generous scheme for the settlement of the Irish question. Mr. Barclay has been informed that the speech delivered by Cardinal 0&apos;Connell, who is the most influential leader of the British in the United States, at a reception given by him to the French and British Roman Catholic Missions at Boston, was intended as an appeal to the British Govern-ment to act before it was too late. If England&apos;s hand were forced by America, not only would Irish opinion be permanently alienated, but the opportunity, created by the Avar, of placing relations of the United States and Great Britain on a sound and lasting footing would be lost.Mr. Barclay has been informed that the President, for internal political reasons, may not be averse to raising the Irish question, but that the Irish leaders are waiting to see the results of the British elections and the policy of the Cabinet before acting.On December .10th a mass meeting Avas held in New York under the auspices of the United Irish American Societies at which a resolution Avas passed urging the President to declare at the Peace Conference that the peoples of Ireland should be gxwerned only with their consent and that the Avill of the majority, ascertained by a plebiscite of the adult population, should be accepted as the soA^ereign will of the people instead of the present rule by force. At another meeting Senator Phelan declared, in a speech dealing Avith Ireland, that if armaments Avere not reduced so as to make a programme of aggression by any one Power ineffective, then the United States Avould be obliged to build the greatest navy in the world.Shipments to Northern Neutrals. The War Trade Board has draAvn up a scheme for the consideration of the Allied Blockade Council. The proposals include: (1) a general increase iu the ration of all commodities to neutral countries up to their full domestic needs ; (2) continuance of export licences ; (3) no licences to be issued to consignees on any black list; (1) applications to be no longer referred to London. The War Trade Board considers that the agreements concluded with the various countries concerned furnish sufficient security against re-exportation to the Central Powers. Mr. Barclay points out the difficulty of making similar concessions to Switzerland, Avhich will undoubtedly demand them,   lie thinks that Allied nations
such, as Greece will be adversely affected if it becomes known that shipments are -being allowed more freely to neutral countries than to them.   He suggests that every effort should be made to maintain control of the more important commodities and to retain an effective black list.ENEMY GROUP.A USTRTA-H UN G A RY.Internal Condition. The usual appeals emanate from Vienna asking the Allies to provide food and fuel. Lord Acton has been told that a catastrophe in Vienna is no longer a matter of days but of hours. Herr Bauer and the Burgomaster of Arienna have again urged that pressure should be brought to bear upon the Czecho-Slovak Government to release coal from Bohemia. A population of 10 millions, they say, cannot be left to starve and freeze in darkness. Lord Kilmarnock learns that the Mayor of Vienna met the neutral representatives at a conference at which it Avas stated that unless coal arrived immediately from Bohemia gas lighting and cooking would cease, and a situation would arise which would lead to famine and pillaging. Sir H. Rumbold has been handed a telegram from a nephew of Prince Lichtenstein in which it, is stated that, owing to Herr Bauer&apos;s policy, a catastrophe is inevitable. It urges intervention by England and the United States, and the despatch of at least 4,000 troops. It asserts that a pogrom on a large scale is being organised in Vienna. With regard to Vorarlberg and the Tyrol the Swiss Government has invited the Inter-Allied Commission to discuss a general scheme of relief which it has already drawn up. The Federal Government, however, requires an assurance that supplies sent into Austria from Switzerland will be replaced by the Entente. The French delegate on the Commission has received instructions to enter into discussions, and Sir H. Rumbold suggests that all the Allied delegates should receive identical instructions so that the French Government, which shows a tendency to act on its own, may not receive all the credit.Bohemia. It is reported through the Wireless stations of the German Govern-meut that on December 12th the Czecho-Slovak troops under the leadership of French and British officers occupied Tetschen, and Bodeubaoh, of Avhich the population is purely German.   On the same day Carlsbad was occupied.It is reported from the same source that the German-Bohemian Government has removed its official residence to Dresden.Interest attaches to a despatch from Sir H. Rumbold, dated November 7th, -which describes Czecho-Slovak aspirations as dealt with at the Conference at Geneva. The Czecho-Slovak State considers itself a sovereign and independent State with its capital at Prague, and its peojde will in no way consent to remain under,any form oil Hapsburg rule. It aims at expanding to its ancient frontiers which will embrace Bohemia, Moravia, and Austrian Silesia, together with certain territories resulting from the rectification of the Hungarian frontier, so as to include the districts peopled by Slovaks exclusively. The region of Lake Neusiedl, which is besprinkled with Slovak and Slovene islets will revert to the new State aud will serve the twofold purpose of forming a corridor between the Czecho-Slovak and the Jugo-Slav States and of erecting a barrier against German expansion towards the Balkans. The Czecho-Slovak State leaves to the future any policy of alliances with the newly formed States, but declares its friendly feelings towards Serbia and the Jugo-Slavs, and favours the creation of Danzig as a Polish port. It is considered important to prevent any union between the Magyars and German Austria as well as between the latter and Germany.GERMANY.General: Attention is drawn to an able and comprehensive report on the Revolution in Germany (G.T. 0475). The author lived in Germany during the four years preceding the war, aud during the war has been interned.   The following may
be noted among the many interesting points. Distinction is drawn between the morale of the troops from the front and those on the lines of communication. The former have so far proved a conservative influence in the general upheaval. One of the chief problems of the future is the attitude of the army after demobilisation when the economic situation will make for uuemployment. The writer states that if the Provisional Government can manage to keep the provisioning arrangements from failing completely until the convening of the National Assembly the situation may be saved. He attaches great importance to the meeting in Berlin on December 16th of the delegates from the Soviets of all Germany. He thinks that a body may then be created which will supplant as the most powerful body within the Empire, the Berlin Soviet. He slates that Hindenburg has increased his popularity by declaring his willingness to work with the Provisional Government.On the other hand, Sir 11. Rumbold states that in the opinion of the Swiss Minister in Berlin the Spartacus group will eventually come into power and Bolshevism will spread through Northern Germany. It is to be noticed, however, that this information, which was imparted by the President, was accompanied by a hint that Germany was in need of food.Bavaria. Dr. Muehlon informed Lord Acton on December 12th that the French troops were received as cordially in the Bavarian Palatinate as in Alsace-Lorraine, though in the latter case he had doubts as to the amount of enthusiasm displayed. Herr Eisner, he asserted, considered that the Palatinate was definitely lost to Germany. He was given to understand that Prince Max of Baden enjoyed considerable support among the Southern States.Sir H. Rumbold has received an account of an interview with Professor Jaffe, the Bavarian Minister of Finance, in which the latter displayed marked pro-English sympathies. He denied the existence in South Germany of any Bolshevist tendencies such as were to be found in Berlin, where many Bolshevist agents had arrived from Russia. He hoped that the Entente Governments would ward off Bolshevism by helping the moderate elements in Germany. If Germany- were not crushed, she would make a rapid political, economic, and military recovery. It was not in the interest of the Entente Powers to exact an excessive indemnity. The loss of Alsace-Lorraine, however, would constitute a formidable obstacle to economic recovery even if France consented to export her surplus iron to Germany.NEUTRAL GROUP.BALTIC PROVINCES.Esthonia. According to a telegram received from Lord Kilmarnock on December 12th, Mr. Menning has again appealed for the assistance of British warships. The Bolshevist army, which has been reinforced, is advancing from the line Walck-Werro (Livonia), and the Esthonians have evacuated Wesenburg. The Esthonian delegates at Stockholm have been requested to represent to the Allied Ministers the necessity of sending at least two regiments of infantry and some batteries to Esthonia. A report from Lord Kilmarnock states that the Germans, who are acting in complicity with the Bolshevists, are withdrawing rolling stock, provisions, and means of communication. He also learns that they intend to hand over Walck to-the Lettish Bolshevists, who are extremely hostile to the Esthonians. The British Government has sent a message to M. Clemenceau suggesting that pressure should be brought to bear on the Germans to facilitate the transport of local troops and to cease their interference with anti-Bolshevist operations. The Eighth German Army Command has left the country by sea and the North Russian Army has placed itself under the orders of the Esthonian Government. (This information conflicts with that given in Report No. 98.) Mr. Clive has been informed by the Esthonian Minister for Foreign Affairs at Helsingfors that the Germans still remaining in the country have cut the railway and telegraph lines between Reval and the forces in the field.   He considers
CHILE.Relations with Peru. The reply of the Chilian Government to the United States Note expresses the conviction that the differences between Chile and Peru will be definitely settled in accordance with the Treaty of Ancon. Chile promised not to disturb the peace. In a conversation with Sir E. Stronge the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that the internal situation had considerably improved and that an amicable settlement with Peru was expected. Sir F. Stronge has been informed by the French Minister of a secret Council held on December 11th at which it was stated that Chile could obtain a supply of munitions now in Japan which belonged to the British Government and that Great Britain would cede to Chile four light cruisers in return for the two battleships which were taken from Chile at the beginning of the war. It was also suggested that Great. Britain should be requested to help in the settlement of the Tacna Arica question.DENMARK.The Schleswig Question. Lord Kilmarnock has received a note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs putting forward the official request of the Danish Government to the British Government to raise the Schleswig question at the Peace Conference.Bolshevism. Lord Kilmarnock reports that the Danish Minister and the Legation at Petrograd left Russia on December 17th.FINLAND.Food Supplies. The Allied Blockade Committee has authorised the shipment to Finland from Sweden or Denmark of 11,000 tons of cereals on the understanding that these quantities wall be replaced by equivalent shipments from the United States.German Troops.--Mr. Clive learns that all the German troops left Helsingfors on December 17th.NETHERLANDS.Passage of the Scheldt. Sir W. Townley has been instructed to address a Note to the Netherlands Government to- the effect that the British Government is making arrangements to transport supplies via the Scheldt and the Rhine and across Limburg, and that it does not anticipate any objection on the part of the Netherlands Govern-nient in view of the passage of German troops through Limburg. The Belgian Minister at The Hague informed Sir W. Townley that, &quot;in reply to the Belgian Note, the Netherlands Government stated that normal conditions would be re-established with regard to the navigation of the Scheldt.Resignation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Mr., Robertson (The Hague) reported on December 16th that the Queen was prepared to accept Mr. Karnebeck&apos;s 7001- 9h Cthat they are playing into the hands of the Bolshevists. A protest has been made to the German Government. The Bolshevists have declared the members of the Esthonian Government outlaws. Lord Kilmarnock states that the middle classes in the Baltic Provinces are bitter towards England, as they consider she has abandoned them to their fate.According to a Russian Wireless report the capture of Narva meant the loss by the Esthonian bourgeoisie of their principal point cVappui, since the White Guards, composed of Russian and German officers, were concentrated at that place. It is further stated thai the authority of the Councils is being consolidated, and that many Esthonians are enlisting in the Red Army.
resignation. The Prime Minister, discussing with the Queen the choice of a successor to the Foreign Minister, stated that Mr. Van Swinderen was not favourably regarded by the Allies. The Queen replied that it was entirely unconstitutional that the Allies should choose her Foreign Secretary.The Kaiser. On December 10th the Prime Minister stated in the Second Chamber that the Government was prepared to consider a different place of residence for the Kaiser if the Foreign Governments proposed one. He declared that energetic action would be taken to prevent airy intrigues. In an interview with Sir W. Townley on the following day, the Minister for Foreign Affairs assured him that the Government had no previous knowledge of the ex-German HmperoPs arrival in Holland.   He denied that a deputation had been sent to meet him.Mr. Maxse (Rotterdam) reported on December 13th that the German Legation, which was continually visited by officers of the German Guard in plain clothes, was in close touch with&apos;the German Crown Prince, lie learns that Court circles are active both in Holland and Germany.A German Proposal.- Mr. Robertson learns that the Catholics at Cologne made proposals to Mr. Nolens to the effect that Holland should be amalgamated with AVestphalia and the Rhine Province.NORWAY.Russian Policy. The recall of the Norwegian Legation from Petrograd has been used by the Socialists to enquire into the Russian policy of the Government. They demand to be informed whether the breach with Russia was forced upon the Norwegian Government by the Allies, whether Norway has been asked to co-operate in the protection of the Baltic Provinces, and whether the Government is acting in association with the other Scandinavian Governments. The Socialists threaten to dispatch a mission to Petrograd and, if they can obtain the support of the Trades Unions, to call a general three days&apos; strike as a protest.SPAIN.Political  Situation. Attention  is  drawn  to  a  Memorandum  (G.T.   6400), describing the political difficulties which led to the fall of the Maura and Alhucemas Governments and which now confront Count Romanones.   A weak foreign policy, which failed to satisfy the growing pro-Ally sympathies of the people, helped to bring  about  Seiior Maura&apos;s  resignation on    October   2nd.    His  successor, the Marques de Alhucemas, who is, perhaps, the weakest, of the Spanish leaders, in coalition with men   wdio were never conspicuous for their political loy-alty, was unable to face the demand for Home Ride for Catalonia.   The policy  of Count Romanones appears to consist in autonomy7 for Catalonia, a good understanding with the Allies abroad, and constitutional reform at home.   If   there   is  truth in the report (oide Report No. 98, page  11)  that  he has Avon the support of Senor Oambo, he will have on his side a man who has held the Catalans together on the Regionalist issue, and who is regarded as the statesman most likely to promote and develop the economic life of Spain.   He will have to face an active Republican and Socialist Party which has been deeply7 influenced by recent events in Germany and Austria.   The Republican Deputies resolved at a recent meeting that a Republic should immediately be proclaimed with a Directorate of five, two of whom are Lerroux and Domingo (the latter has openly demanded the King&apos;s abdication in the Chamber).   This Directorate has issued a manifesto declaring that Spain cannot continue to exist as a monarchy7 and setting forth a programme of political, social and economic reform.    The Republicans apparently also wish to secure Gibraltar in exchange for concessions on the African coast.   The author of the Memorandum finds it difficult to estimate the power of the revolutionaries, but thinks there is still a chance of retaining the monarchy if monarchical politicians, and Count Romanones in particular, have the honesty and energy to embark on a real course of reform.
With, reference to the Catalan question Sir A.. Hardinge reports that the Spanish Government has published a reply to the local Assembly. The work of drafting a Bill, based, Sir A. Hardinge thinks, on the Irish Act, is being given to a Royal Commission which is to be appointed immediately. On November 19th Sir A. Hardinge was given an audience by the King who expressed his desire after the war to strengthen the commercial ties uniting Spain and Great Britain. The King-alluded to French aggression in Morocco and suggested that Spain and France should relinquish their interest in Tangier and agree to hand the Tangier zone over to England in return for the cession of Gibraltar to Spain. Speaking of the internal situation in Spain, he regretted that some of the Allied consular representatives had played into the hands of the revolutionary elements which sought, to identify the triumph of the Allies with that of anti-monarchical forces throughout Europe, hy receiving the congratulations of so-called pro-Ally deputations, largely composed of Republicans and Socialists.Relations with Germany. The Spanish Government has demanded the recall of the German Ambassador and certain members of the Embassy on account of their active interference in the internal politics of Spain.SWITZERLAND.Internal Conditions.

Rumbold on December 15th that as a result of an enquiry into the recent political disturbances in Switzerland, the Government had decided to expel from the country IS Bolshevists and 15 Italian anarchists.

Rumbold has been informed that Mr. Wilson has been invited by the Federal Government to visit Switzerland.THE VATICAN.Alleged Franco-Papal Scheme. Sir Ii. Rumbold reports that Prince Schoenburg has had an interview with the Papal Nuncio in Munich, in which he received the impression that the latter possessed information concerning the alleged Franco-Papal scheme for the creation of a Catholic South German monarchy, which would include Munich and Vienna. The Papal agent at Berne told Lord Acton that it was thought at the Vatican that the Rhenish Palatinate would be comprised in the above scheme.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.(N.B.

(Lord Derby1-, December 13th).The following suggestion for reparation by Germany has been put forward bv a Canadian who has been in Germany since the outbreak of war, and has just returned to this country : &quot; If the rebuilding of devastated areas could be carried out as far as possible by German labourers, tins would at once relieve the difficulties of finding employment for men in Germany under present circumstances, and therewith relieve the Allies from the unwelcome probable effects of the chaos which would result there from continued unemployment of such masses of men. It would also leave the industrial population of Belgium and France free for its own industrial work. For the rest the Allies might insist that certain of the groat Geiinan mining and industrial concerns should be handed over to Entente control for whatever period of years the Allies might determine ; German capital in these under-takings being provided with low-iuterest-bearing bonds. In this way the Allies would themselve&apos;s control the production and distribution of products of these works ; German industry would be gaining no advantages for future trade from the working of them ; there could no longer be objection from our side to the supplying of raw material to them in so far as this might be necessary under any scheme of the Allied Governments for carrying on these works ; the German labour involved would be sure of employ-nient, and thus again the dangers which could accrue to us from a chaos in the German industrial world would be averted ; the entire profits from this labour would however go toward liquidating the indemnity imposed upon Germany; and the Allied Governments would control the distribution of all the products.&quot; (G.T. 4675.)Attempts are being made to sell industrial concerns in Alsace-Lorraine, confiscation&apos; being feared.German Wireless of December 12th contains the usual quotations from the neutral (?) Press slandering the Allies about armistice conditions and policy.
