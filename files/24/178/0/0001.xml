CONFJDtiM 1 IAL LIBRARY[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government f &quot;THIS is not as my colleagues might suppose taken from the new Land Campaign literature, but is an extract from a speech by Lord Randolph Churchill in the House of Commons on the 20th March, 1884.The House would see that there was an immense difference between rural and urban landlords.Urban landlords had acquired more by chance than by anything else property with a value attaching to it and a power attaching to it which never could have been contemplated by the State in framing laws in regard to property.   (&quot; Hear, hear! &quot; from the Ministerial side.)   Let them consider the power which a great landlord could exercise in London, or Manchester, or Birmingham.    He could act as a complete obstructionist of all public improvements or progress.   (Hear.)   He could exercise the most despotic power over every individual who resided on his property. Nobody residing on his property could&apos; alter his house or improve his house without the consent of the owner of the property, and when the alterations were made with the consent of the owner they reverted to the owner at the expiration of the lease. Would anybody tell him why an urban landlord should have power which we utterly declined to confer on a rural landlord?   (Hear, hear.)   There was no real freedom of contract at all in those parts of towns where there were great accumulations of land.   Belgrave Square was in the hands of one owner, and no one could live there except on the owner&apos;s conditions.   If Devonport came to be owned by a landlord regardless of public opinion, he could turn out half the population.   Was it ever contemplated that such powers should be exercised by one man ?   Was it unreason-able that Parliament should make an effort to limit the rights of owners of urban property?   The object of the two Bills of the hon. member for Stoke and himself ought to commend itself to hon. members on the opposite side of the House, because it was the multiplication of freeholders.   Nothing acted as such a powerful stimulus to Socialism and popular discontent, or favoured conditions that were likely to bring about revolution, more than enormous accumulations of land in single hands  (cheers) either in the country or in towns, but more especially in towns.   Parlia-ment had done something to stop this accumulation in the country.   In the course of a few years the Act of Lord Cairns would have broken up a great many estates. Why should not Parliament make an effort to break up the accumulation of land in towns, where it was fiftv times more objectionable?   It had been calculated that if the House legislated on the principle of this Bill 2,000,000 freeholders would be created in a short time.   It was proposed to add 2,000,000 to the electoral roll; would it not be better that that number of electors should be freeholders than, that they should be men liable to be turned out of their houses and subjected to every kind of injustice and extortion? ....   Who was the more likely to be a contented and patriotic citizen the man who was a freeholder and who was safe in his property, or the man who was at the mercy of a colossal landowner?   It was utterly against all public interest not to take some decided action with respect to these large landed properties in towns. The breaking up of large accumulations in towns must be under-taken by one side of the House or the other before long.   Without doubt, the State had the right to set its face against particular tenures of land if it held that they were mischievous; it had done so before, and it would do so again.Printed for the Cabinet.
