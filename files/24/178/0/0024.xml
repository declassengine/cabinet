II. POSITION  IN  CHIEF  INDUSTRIES. COAL MINING.Uuring the last three months has been witnessed that improvement in the coal-mining industry which has. exerted so important an influence in the unemployment situation. The absorption of unemployed miners was most marked during December, but at the close of the month the position was still worse than it was at end of 1924.IRON AND STEEL.Unemployment has continued to be abnormal in this industry and there are few signs of material improvement since last September. Towards the end of the year, however, prospects were better and a general tendency to more full-time working was evident.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.The position in the shipbuilding industry remained, unsatisfactory, a slight improvement in some districts being counterbalanced by a decline in employment in other areas.In repair work the usual seasonal reconditioning of ships absorbed an appreci-able number of unemployed.ENGINEERING.In engineering as a whole unemployment was still heavy, but the position is better than it was a year ago.In motor, cycle, and in electrical engineering, employment continued good, while a demand, for construction work resulted in increased activity in this branch. Marine engineering, on the other hand, showed little improvement.TEXTILES.Cotton. While in this industry there were upward fluctuations, the employment position on the whole remained unchanged, instability in prices of the raw material and a slackening in demand for manufactured goods, preventing any decided improvement.Woollen and Worsted. In these highly localised industries signs were not wanting of a recovery from the acute depression which set in about the end of 1924. It was most noticeable in the worsted trade. In the low-woollen trade at Batley and Dewsbury, there was but little improvement.Lace. The difficult position in which this industry finds itself was, in general, unchanged, a further decline in employment taking place at Long Eaton and Derby.Hosiery. The unemployment situation was somewhat easier, the recovery being most marked in Nottingham.Silk. There were few signs of improvement in the silk industry, and, except in the artificial silk branch, unemployment remained very heavy.BUILDING. BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.In the building industry and in brick and tile manufacture, employment continued to be fair. Among skilled building operatives the normal seasonal depression was somewhat more severe than last year.CLOTHING TRADES.Apart from a slight increase in activity during December, the tailoring trade showed the usual seasonal slackness.In the boot and shoe industry there has been no marked improvement, but business was more brisk in Leicester owing to demand for Russian hoots.POTTERY.The position in the pottery industry was still unsatisfactory, and, except at Worcester and, Derby, there has been little relief in the unemployment situation.TRANSPORT AND SHIPPING SERVICES.The general activity which is to be expected at this period of the year received a further stimulus from the demand for shipping services for the export of coal, especially in South Wales and in the North-Eastern Areas.
III. WORK INSTITUTED FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.Numbers Employed.[See note on page 1 of November 1924 Report (CP. 541 (24) ).] The table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistance from the Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.Scope of Table. The schemes included are those undertaken by Local and other Authorities and Public Companies with a financial contribution from the State with the object of relieving unemployment; certain schemes put in hand by Government Departments for the same purpose; and works in respect of which guarantees have been given under the Trade Facilities Acts as capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in this country. Schemes to which State financial assistance is given, but which are not undertaken primarily for the relief of unemployment (e.g., Housing Schemes), and works put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance are not included. Certain other schemes involving Government assistance are also excluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with employment thereby; these include the Export Credits Scheme and contracts for equipment, clothing, &amp;c, accelerated by Government Contracting Departments.Method of Compilation. The figures for the Road and Bridge Schemes assisted by the Ministry of Transport and for schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee are (with the exception of certain road schemes in respect of which returns are received direct by the Ministry of Transport) obtained from returns received at Employment Exchanges from Local and other Authorities and Public Companies. Those relating to schemes assisted under the Trade Facilities Acts are compiled by the Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whom guarantees under the Acts have been given. In the case of the remaining works the figures are compiled or estimated by the Departments mentioned. The figures given tor December 1924, which have been prepared (so far as information is available) on the same basis as that now in use, provide an approximately accurate comparison.

The figures take no account of the employment provided indirectly, e.g., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.t No figures available.I No distinction is now made between the Forestry Commission^ normal and relief work, and grants for afforestation form part of the normal programme. The average number of the Commission^ Forest Employees during the quarter ended December 31st, 1925, was 2,108 as compared with 1,836 for the corresponding quarter of 1924.S Scheme completed.II These figures indicate men employed oh the work itself. They include part only of the men employed on &apos;the manufacture of the materials used. They take no account&apos; of the labour involved in winning, transporting, &amp;c, raw materials.
IV.-OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act to make better provision for furthering British settlement in His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions), various schemes have been agreed with Dominion Authorities. This Act, as its title implies, is not one of the Government measures designed to deal with unemployment, and should not be so regarded. It should be borne in mind that the excess of the total outward over the total inward movement from this country is somewhat less than 100,000 a year, and therefore small in comparison with the natural increase of population which for many years before and after the war has not been much less than 400,000 a year.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the months of October, November and December (with the corresponding figures for last year) and for the nine months ended the 31st December, 1925 and 1924, respectively, are set out in the following Table: Quarterly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The Empire Settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.Dominion.

The Scheme, however, closed to new applications in December 1922.

Expenditure by Poor Law Authorities, A (England and Wales), B (Scotland).These Statistical Tables have been compiled with a view to showing the extent of the effort from public sources since the Armistice to meet the problems of Post-War Resettlement and Unemployment, and to indicate the measure of assistance provided by the Exchequer. With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.

(Estimates, Class VII, Vote 3.)The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided Insurance against unemployment in certain selected industries. It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924 the rates of benefit were raised (from 15s.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12s.) to 15s. a week for women, with 2s. (instead of Is.) a week for each young dependent child. Until the 30th June, 1926, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may be paid during unemployment subject to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the disqualification for benefit in the case of persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.Statement of Income and Expenditure from Armistice to December 26, 1925.Expenditure                     Benefit paid         ....          ....          .... 231,894,000Appropriation for Administration   .... 22,048,000Section 9 Unemployment InsuranceAct (No. 2), 1924         ....          .... 1,474,000Miscellaneous Refunds, &amp;c.....          ....          .... 2,949,000--   258,365,000

(U.) Ministry of Transport Schemes.Road and Bridge Programme, 1919-20. To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such ,time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn a grant aggregated in cost to approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment Works assisted out of the Road Fund. 1920-23 Programmes.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920/21, and the following statement shows the total estimated expenditure by the contributing parties to date and a forecast of expendi-ture during subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923.Payments during Year.

Land Settlement.In England and Wales the provision under the. Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, of small holdings and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and (b) through the agency of County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs.Settlement through Local Authorities. These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to the 31st March, 1926, the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders being borne by the Exchequer. No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet cash outgoings.Land Settlement.(A.) England and Wales.
