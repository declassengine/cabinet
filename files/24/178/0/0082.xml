E2 $J* 2.... the n Home,, S sore ta rjrii  jopsii m$ t i QS-Q f^5^?. ^a. 6^25 JO.1.     GETTERAL POSITION..Since my last Report several important measures have been taken to improve the emergency organisation and there is now very little remaining to he clone before the actual occurrence of an emergency. 2.     MEETINGS Off COMMITTEES.There have been one meeting of the Cabinet Committee and three meetings of the Standing Sub-Committee since 6th October.A Sub-Committee has been appointed to inquire into the important question of the extent to which the Goveriment should assume responsibility for compensation in respect of damage to transport and other property lent or requisitioned in connection with an emergency and in respect of bodily injury to volunteers. An interim report has been received and it has been decided to appoint Sir Ernest Bain (who has assisted the Government on previous occasions) to aot as the Government1s agent and adviser in questions connected with emergency insurances, with the assistance of a Committee of representatives of the Chief Insurance Companies, the Treasury and the Ministry of Transport. It is hoped that the Sub-Committee will be able to present a final report at an early date.A series of informal Conferences between officials of the Departments chiefly concerned with the emergency arrangements was started in November, and the Conferences are now he] u at fortnightly intervals.     The principal object of the Conferences is to keep the Departments in touch with each other; they have
also facilitated the conduct of a substantial amount of businessnot of sufficient importance to bring before the Standing Sub-Committee or the Cabinet Committee. 3.      CIVIL COMMISSIONERS1.....QHG aNI3ATI0JJ.fa) The Chief Civil Commissioner has kept in close touch with the organisation in all Divisions through regular reports from the Chief Assistants, and is satisfied with the progress whioh has been made.fb) The vacancies in the posts of Food Officers and Police Liaison Officers on the Divisional Staffs (referred to in para1(a)  of my last report) have all been filled-    As regards the Port Labour employers,  it has been arranged that the associations at the headquarter ports of the water Transport District Committee shall be represented  on the Divisional staffs by the Chairmen of those Committees, and in other ports through the Chairman of the Volunteer Servioe Committee,  on which they are represented.Arrangements have also been made with the Canal Association for the appointment of Canal Representatives to advise the Civil Commissioners in the 6 Divisions where inland water transport has any degree of importance o(c)    Nine new Volunteer Service Committees have been set up and Chairmen appointed in all cases except three.    Arrangements are being made to fill these vacancies and also two or three vacanoies which have been caused by resignations elsewhere.    The instructions to Chairmen have been brought up to date and revised instructions have been circulated. 4.      CIRCULAR TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES.In pursuance of the Cabinet decision, a circular was issued to local authorities on 20th November, defining their duties in an emergency and giving information as to their relations with the Government organisation.
Oe the whole the Circular has been well received and co-operation by Local Authorities may generally be anticipated.     In several cases a resolution has been passed that the Circular should lie upon the table but this does not necessarily mean that the local Authority would not co-operate, should occasion arise *In South Yorkshire opposition is to be expected as well as in certain districts near the Merthyr Valley in South Wales,  though the attitude of the South Viales Local Authorities generally has not on the whole been unfriendly *In the Northern Division the Circular appears to have been regarded generally from a political point of view but the opposition does not seem to be very seri ous.In the North Midland Division in consequence of the Circular, some Local Authorities have overhauled their own organisation and are making preparations for an emergencyeIn London, the municipalities abutting on both sides of the River, east of the City, have shown no desire to co-operate but when an emergency is imminent they will probably agree to assisto TRANSPORT *(a) Road Transport.The development of plans for the organisation of Road Transport has shown that it is necessary to increase the number of separate areas and 148 separate sub-centres, . outside London,  in. England and Wales have now been set up.      The appointments of Road OfficTS
A Q Cand Chairmen of Haulage Committees at all these * \ centres are now practically complete, hut changes [take place from time to time owing to the resignation of the men originally appointed.A special Haulage Committee has been set up for the Metropolitan area with 3 Road Officers in that area.      The Committee has had two full meetings. The members have undertaken responsibility for particular sections of the trade fecgo conveyance of meat, wheat and flour,  etc) and consultations have taken place with the individual members, who have made good progress with their plans.Arrangements have been made between the Home Office and the Ministry of Transport for the Police to assist the Road Officers in the preparation of lists of mechanically propelled commercial vehicles in the various areas and this is now in hand.Divisional Food Officers have been engaged upon determining the routes which will be most useful for the transport of food in an emergency.      The information collected from them is now being communicated by the Board of Trade to the Ministry of Transport and the Home Office and is mapped.A scheme is being considered by the Minister of Transport whereby vehicles requisitioned under the Lmergehcy Powers will be operated by Haulage Contractors on Government account, and a draft Agreement under whioh such Contractors would operate has been drawn up and is under discussion with the Commercial Motor Users1 Association.Certain amplifications of the Emergency Regu-lations have been found to be necessary and the amend-meuts are.,
if?being made and Orders under the Regulations are being draf to d .(b) Rai2.f2.Yfji.Discussions have taken place between the Minister of Transport and the Hallway Companies with, a view to ascertaining that the Companies are making progress with their own plans, and a Conference has taken place between representatives of the Board of Trade and the principal Railway Companies with regard to foodstuffs left derelict on the railways in the event of a. stoppage and also with a view to ensuring that  such train services as can be run in an emergency shall be used on the routes most important for the transport of food.      The Railway Companies refuse naturally to give any guarantee cf  such services, hut my advisers are fairly satisfied that there will not be a complete and absolute stoppage of all trains,6.    ELECTRICAL POWER STATIONS IK THE ORBITER LONDON AREA aThe revision of the LoE,P0 Scheme dealing with the arrangements for manning the London Power Stations has been actively pursued.      This revision is necessary on account of developments at the London stations during the last few years, and the requirements of each under-taking as regards Laval Ratings and volunteers will vary accordingly.      New lists of volunteers have been, obtained from Technical Institutions, etc and these volunteers are now being allocated to the various stations, more than 50 per cent, of the hey positions having been allocated,7.    PRESERVATION OP ORDER,(a) Schemes have been, worked out for the better safe-guarding against seizure by ill-disposed persons of (i) explosives, particularly those in. use at mines or quarries or in process of distribution thereto,, and(ii ) arms and ammunition, more particularly those-5-
in possession of Rifle Clubs,  Cadet Corps, etc.(b) The Emergency Regulations have been reviewed: two additional Regulations relating to Police powers have been drafted and certain other amendments settled in consultation with the Departments concerned,(c) Particulars of the more important vulnerable points throughout the country have been obtained and analysed^      Not much further progress, however, can be made with this problem,  or with the further arrangements for the protection of long distance convoys., pending a decision as to the scope to be assigned to the military^ a matter which I hope to pursue at an early date08,      FOOD SERVICES. ( a ) Divisional Qr,q;anlsationaDivisional Officers are making satisfactory progress with their emergency arrangements.. Conferences with the principal food traders concerned have been held and the necessary panels of advisers or technical committees have been established,The headquarters staffs of Divisional Pood Officers include 24 Technical Assistants of whom 18 have been appointed and are in possession of the Emergency Instructions issued to Divisional Officers,      I am assured that the remaining 6 will be available when required. In many cases these Officers are voluntarily attending Conferences held by the Divisional Officers in their Divisions .(b) Docai Food Officers.The total required is 309.      When the last report was made 90 had been appointed,   leaving 219 vacancies. Since then a  further 177 have been selected,  leaving
only 42 appointments still tc be made.These,it is-anticipated, will be filledshortly.Arrangements have been completed for.obtaining returns of stocks of wheat,  flour, meat, bacon and ham, butter, cheese, canned goods, canned milk,  jam,  sugar and tea in each of the 11 Divisions,.      Returns in respect of the stocks of these commodities as at 30th January have been asked for in each Division,      Although returns are coming in well it is not anticipated that a complete return will be available before next month;(d)    Trade. Co&quot;operation.The Technical Advisers of the Board of Trade have been freely consulted with re.ga.rd to trade problems and in particular in connection, with the obtaining of stock returns.      The Trade Associations generally have shown a disposition to be helpful.Conferences with the trades are continuing,  and the only commodity in which the attitude of the traders gives cause for dissatisfaction is milk.      The Representatives of the London Milk Trade at a Committee,  convened specially for the purpose, unexpectedly passed a resolution which in effect demands that the. Government shall take both financial and executive control of the distribution of the London milk supplies in an emergency.      The president of the Board of Trade is to meet this Committee at an early date in an endeavour to induce the Trade to take a more enterprising view of their responsibilities:.Similar difficulties have occurred in regard to milk in some other centres, notably Birmingham.      It is anticipated that these local difficulties will be more easily capable of adjustment than the difficulty in London and that the settlement  of the latter may assist in
overcoming the difficulties in the provincial towns. tjQO(e) Organiaers^ of Voluntary Seafaring Labour, Organisers have now been appointed in the twoScottish Divisions and this Organisation is now complete. The Instructions for the Organisers have been revised and issued to the officials concerned,StlpTMWD,9.      (a) The Organisation for which the Secretary forScotland is responsible has been considerably developedduring recent months,     The Circular issued to LocalAuthorities on 21st November appears generally to havesmallbeen well received^     A few/Town Councils in mining areas resolved that the Circular should lie upon the table or otherwise indicated a non-co--operative attitude.     The Corporation of Aberdeen resolved to take no action on the Circular but this was done by a chance majority (of 12 to 11) and is likely to be reversed,.     The Corporation of Glasgow by a majority decided to set up a Committee to consider necessary arrangements, and a very usefxil meeting has been held between the District Commissioner (Sir Arthur Rose, D0SoG.,) and the Lord Provost, Town Clerk and other representatives of the Corporation,      In Edinburgh and Dundee there has not been a discussion in the Town Council but full co-operation during an emergency is anticipated.The Circular has served, a good purpose in clearing up the general position.      It has had the further effect of concentrating attention on the actual problems which may arise in an emergency.      The District Commissioners generally are in close touch with Local Authorities, and in. some cases with firms,  in their respective areas with a view to promoting desirable co-operation.      District Commissioners
have also had meetings with their Food, a nd Haulage Committees.(b) A Conference of District C-Tmnissi.oners and representatives of the Scottish Office,  Scottish Command General Post Office and Ministry of Transport was held in Edinburgh last month for the purpose of exchanging information and discussing further developments.      It then appeared that the local organisation under each Commissioner was being effectively consolidated by consultation with the expert assistants on the various subjectso(c) Arrangements for the safeguarding of stocks of Explosives held in magazines belonging to the agents of Messrs, Nobel have been substantially adjusted with that firm.      These negotiations have been condticted jointly with, the Home Office,  and the arrangements are on the same lines in both countries.(d) Information respecting vulnerable points has been collected and will be the subject of discussion with the Military Authorities.Vi c J.E,Home Office.22nd February,  1926.
