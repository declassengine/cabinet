Percentage of unemployment (Great Britain) in the insured industries at the end of January 1924     .... .... .... ....   11-81925     .... .... .... ....   11-11926     ................   10&quot;8From Table (A) above it will be seen that the number of persons on the registers on the 25th January, 1926, shows an increase of 98,427 over the position on the 21st December, 1925. This increase is, however, not indicative of a general decline in employment during the period as, following a rapid rise in figures in the fortnight immediately after Christmas, partly due to the discharge of temporary postal workers, there has been a consistent reduction in the three succeeding weeks. The industrial situation, with the exception of some of the Textile Industries, showed little appreciable change, and it is noteworthy that the increase in the number of men unemployed in the South-Eastern Division during the period is greater than the cumulative increase in the number of men on the registers of the other six Divisions.The position at the 25th January, 1926, was decidedly better than at the corresponding dates in 1924 and 1925, the decrease from a year ago being 40,095, and from two years ago 119,691.(C.) Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 25th January, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 11*1, as compared with 10&apos;5 at the 21st December, 1925, with 11-2 at the 26th January, 1925, and with 11&apos;9 at the 28th January, 1924.The figures at the 25th January, 1926, in respect of industries showing appreciable variations in unemployment during the month, together with the increase or decrease as compared with the previous month and with a year ago, are given in the table below: Industry.

Seasonal depression in the Building and Tailoring Trades contributed to the decline. In addition, employment in the Cotton Trade received a set-back, while the improvement in the Woollen and Worsted Trades, which was indicated in the last report, has been checked, and this accounts for the relatively large increase in the number of women unemployed in the North-Eastern Division. The Engineering Industry also showed signs of a falling-off in employment.
On the other hand, in the Coal-mining Industry, the improvement continued, although at a somewhat decreasing rate, while a satisfactory change was noticeable, especially on the Tees-Side, in the Iron and Steel Trades, in which there were 4,742 more persons at work than on the 21st December. Shipbuilding was in general unchanged, although Ship-repairing showed signs of some activity, and in Marine Engineering a slight increase in employment was witnessed. Among Textiles, the Linen Trade showed the most marked signs of improvement.Generally speaking, the position in insured industries on the 25th January, 1926, was slightly better than it was a year ago; Iron and Steel showed a decrease in unemployment, but in spite of the activity which has been evident in Coal-mining during the recent months, this industry is still in a worse position than at the corresponding date in 1925. This is most noticeable in the Durham Coalfield, where the number of miners unemployed is as high as 18&apos;8 per cent.(D.) Latest Figures.The latest figures of unemployment published are those for the 15th February, giving the total number on the registers as 1,139,300. The decrease over the position at the 25th January amounts to 61,527, and over the figures of a year ago to 100,496. Whilst the distribution of the decrease over the various industries is not yet definitely known, a geographical analysis shows that it was shared by all the Divisions.A.
