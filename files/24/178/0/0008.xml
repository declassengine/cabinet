(&apos;Adoptsd &quot;by the Ooune.il)I an. extremely glad that the Council will be able so early as at this session, to meet the wishes of the Sixth Assembly by setting up the Preparatory Committee for the Economic Conference.     My co7i.leagu.33 are aware of the great interest which the &quot;French delegations proposal has aroused, and of the universal welcome it has received *1 have the honour to propose to the Council that it adopt the following resolution?THE COUNCIL,Eoting the resolution of the 6th Assembly; &quot;The Assembly,:firmly resolved to seek all possible means of establishing pesos throughout the world;Convinced that economic peace will largely contribute to security among the nations;Persuaded of the necessity of investigating the economic difficulties w.hlab. stand in the way of the revival, of general prosperityh and of ascertaining the best means of overcoming these difficulties and of preventing disputes;Invites the Council to consider at the earliest possible moment the expediency of constituting on a wide basis a Preparatory Committee vhich, with the assistance of the Technical Organisations of the league and the International Labour Office, will prepare the work of an International Economic Conference.
The convening of this Conference under the auspices of the league of Nations shall be a matter for subsequent decisions by the Council.And after examining the proposal submitted by the French Government, with regard to the composition of a Preparatory Committee, and th e observations of other Govemmen-sa and of the technical organisations and of the International labour Office o&amp; that proposaloAnd having approved the Report of the Rapporteur;DECIDES1.      To appoint a technical Preparatory Committee,  consisting not of representatives of Governments or of organisations but of persons chosen as experts and beet fitted by their qualifications and personal experience for the task of preparing fcr the Conference.2.       The task of this Committee will be to arrange for the preparation and collection of such economic information as may assist the work of the Conference, and to consider and present for the approval of the Council the programme, composition, rules of procediire and date of meeting of the Conference^ 3.-       This Committee will be composed of persons drawn in part from the technical organisations of the League and the International Labour Office, in part from persons with experience of industry, commerce and agriculture, in part from persons of scientific qualifications as economists,  in part from persons who. can express the workers&apos; and consumers1 points of view.

The Council, having considered the list presented bythe Rapporteur and the Secretary-General, authorises the issue
of invitations in conformity with it, and the publication of the composition of the committee on receipt of acceptances from the persons inviteSoThe appointments will be personal in character^    In ease a member is unable to attend, the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee will be authorised to ix?.vite another person of similar qualifications to attend in his place.The date of the first meeting of the Committee will be determined by the Chairmen in consultation with the Secretary-Gene raloThere is no need to explain the reasons which, forbid the publication of the list of invitations which will be issued to the persons chosen by the Council until the Secretary^General has received acceptances from the persons concerned eThe Secretary-General will of course be authorised to use the report on which the Council has taken its decision, in order to acquaint the persons invited to sit on the Preparatory Committee with the nature of the duties the Council is entrusting to thessoI would venture briefly to explain the significance of the decisions which the Council is about to reach ?    These decisions /are based strictly on the Assembly Resolution and the discussions of the Second Committee;    the Preparatory Committee will be composed of persons sitting as experts and not as representatives of any Government or organisation.    It will be entirely untrammelled in its discussions.   With a view to drawing up the programme of the Conference, the Committee3o
will have to consider in what domains the economic difficulties which are at present experienced are international in character, and to discover the points in respect of which practical solutions might he contemplated, together With the appropriate methods of giving effect to these solutions.    The conclusions of the Committee as regards the programme., Composition, rules or procedure and date of the Conference will be submitted to ths &quot;councils the Council will keep in touch with the work of the Preparatory Committee by sitting as a special committee, to which Governments Members of the Council may send delegates other than these who ordinarily represent them at sessions of the Council. If necessary, it will advise the Preparatory Committee as to how it should carry out- its work.The undoubted qualifications of the persons on the list and the number of nationalities represented afford every guarantee as to the efficacy     and impartiality of the Committee7s work.    This gathering of experts who have participated in the work of the technical organisations of the League of Nations and in that of the International. labour Office, men who hs^e personal experience of business and industrial life, men of science who have devoted their lives to economic problems, and qualified representatives of the working classes and the consumers,, will make the Preparatory Committee, as contemplated in the Council resolution, an organ perfectly adapted to fulfil its task, am organ in which all the main interests affected will be represented^4o
