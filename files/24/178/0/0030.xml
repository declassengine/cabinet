In view of the criticism likely to be levelled against the Government as soon as the House meets, in consequence of the restriction of grants in aid of relief works, I have inquired into the present position of this matter and set the facts out briefly in this memorandum for the information of my colleagues. !3.     The decision to restrict the grants was reached by the Economy Committee of the Cabinet In November, 1925.     in oonsequenoe, the Unemployment Grants Committee sent to all Local Authorities a ciroular letter dated the 15th Deoember,  1925 (copy -   attached)   informing them that in future before approving a scheme for grant,  the Committee would require to bo satisfied:-*Not only that the work is in all respects a suitable one of public utility put in hand out of ordinary courseIexpressly for the purpose of relieving unemployment, but also that it would not otherwise be undertaken for a considerable, period (ordinarily more than 5 years), and that the unemployment sought to be relieved is exceptional&quot;. 3.     It has boon ruled that in general, in ordor to constitute &quot;exceptional unemployment&quot;    for this purpose the average percentage of unemployment for the past 12 months must have been at least 15, but the Grants Committee have been empowered subject to other conditions being satisfied to make a grant when the percentage ratio is slightly under 15 if the present rate of unemployment is appreciably In exoesB of 15^ and appears likely to remain so during the ensuing a months.   Thebo figures for obvious reasons have not been mado public, and it is important at this stage that they should not be announced.
4, The Treasury at the outset ruled that theCommittee should not make grants in respect of road schemes but that ruling has since been withdrawn and the Committee may now make such grant3 on the merits of the particular scheme submitted.5. .      The Committee were also permitted to make grants on the old terms in respect of schemes submitted to them before the date of the restriction where it might be said that the Local Authority was committed to carry out the work in question.    The principal factors in determining whether the Authority is committed are -(a) if the application for the grant was beforethe Committee prior to the 30th September, 1925,. and(b) If the application for the grant was made after 30th September, 1925, but prior to 30th November, 1925, and it can be shown that the Local  -Authority was committed  to the scheme either by reason of the expense it had already entailed or by some action on behalf of the Committee, e,g, the promise of a grant if the scheme was modified In any particular way,6. The number of schemes which the Committee have regarded as &quot;commitment&quot; cases and dealt with on the old lines is 90, as followsCapital Scheme s. Value. .Approved 48 339,000Not approved 9 76,000Under consideration 33 614,000(including 4 schemes of the value of 36O.,000). ^
7, The number of schemes falling to be consideredby the Committee under the restricted terms, i.e, the sum of the number of schemes submitted before the issue of the circular In respect of which there is no commitment, and the number of schemes submitted since (up to 26th January, 1926), is 489, as follows 1-No, of CapitalSchemes.       Value..Approved 6 124,000Not approved 405 2,952,000Under consideration 78 1,543,000Failure to pass the test of exceptionalunemployment was the ground of rejection in most casesbut it cannot of course be assumed that schemes rejectedon this ground would have passed the other tests,8. Prior to the restriction of the grants, in theperiod between 1st May, 1925 and 26th November,  1925,the decisions of the Committee had been as f ollows:-No.  of CapitalSchemes,      Value. .Approved 1,072 12,222,063Not approved 345 2,950,0479. Of the schemes    under consideration at thepresent time an appreciable number stand referred to the Technical Departments who are required to advise the Committee as to whether the scheme is to be regarded as &quot;a suitable one of public utility&quot; and &quot;that it would not otherwise be undertaken for a considerable period (ordinarily more than 5 years)&quot;,
1.7 i10.   Under the restricted terms; grants heve been promised in respect of schemes in the following localities -Glasgow, Sunder Isold, Gateshead, Tynemouth, Bellingham,(OcUurham) Airdrie (Lanark), and grants have been refused to such Authorities as Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds,Darlington, Nottingham, Hull, Cardiff and Manchester.. 11,   A number of protests regarding the new conditions have been received from Local Authorities (including the Association of Municipal Corporations) and also fron political bodies, mainly Trade Unions and branches of the Labour Party.     These protests are based on the following contentions amongst others:-1.    That the problem of unemployment is more than ever a National problem and not a local one and that the restrictions imposed by the Government cast further expense on those Authorities while relieving the Exchequer. 2.    That it is much more desirable to provide work than to maintain unemployed persons out of the Unemployment Fund or by way of outdoor relief, and 3.    That Local Authorities in distressed areas have, for 4 years past, been promoting relief work schemes to an extent which makes it difficult, if not impossible, for them to suggest further works accelerated by a period of more than 5 years, 12*   A further type of protests&apos;comes from Birmingham and other towns.     In July 1925, with the approval of the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment, officers of the Unemployment Grants Committee visited over 60 Local Authorities in Great Britsin and without, of course,/pledging
pledging the Committee in any way, xurged looal Authorities to submit schemes of relief work prima facie likely to receive assistance from the Committee. Birmingham was one of the towns visited.     The City Council, however,  did not make formal application to the Committee for a grant in respect of schemes its officers formulated, although in fact work on one or two schemes was started.      It is thought the.t this delay in making formal application arose from the belief that the Government would increase the- rete of grant.     3?he Birmingham schemes now fall to be considered under the new conditions and since the conditions are not satisfied the Committee have refused a grant.(Intel. ) A.

Parish Councils.WORKS FOR THE RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.Sir,I am directed by the Unemployment Grants Committee to refer to their Circular Letter of the 30th March, 1925, with regard to schemes of work undertaken by Local Authorities with State assistance for the relief of unemployment.The Government have recently had under consideration the question of grants from State funds in relief of unemployment, and it has been decided by them that the Committee should in future satisfy themselves, before approving any scheme which may be submitted to them, not only that the work is in all respects a suitable one of public utility put in hand out of ordinary course expressly for the purpose of relieving unemployment, but also that it would not otherwise be undertaken for a considerable period (ordinarily more than five years) and that the unemployment sought to be relieved is exceptional.The Committee will, therefore, only be able to entertain applications for grants in respect of new schemes of work if they clearly comply with these conditions. Out-standing schemes at present before the Committee are being considered upon their merits, and with due regard to the Governments decision. A separate communication respecting these schemes will in due course be addressed to the individual Local Authorities.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,T. P. NORMS, Assistant Secretary.&quot;Unemployment Grants Committee, 23, Buckingham Gate,Lonuon, S.W.1.15th December, 1925.A copy of the Circular Letter is forioarded herewith for the information of the Surveyor to the Authority.W5625)  Wt 19823-112 10.000 12/25 H.
