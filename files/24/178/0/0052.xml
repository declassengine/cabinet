[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]SECRET. Copy No.CP. 51 (28).  -CABINET.NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE IMAM OE THE YEMEN.Memorandum Circulated by Secretary of State eor the Colonies.NEGOTIATIONS have for some time been proceeding with the Imam of the Yemen, whose territory borders on the Aden Protectorate. This Arab ruler was a Turkish vassal ,before the war, but all Turkish influence having been eliminated from his territory, he now constitutes the responsible authority with whom the Resident at Aden has to deal. The frontier of the Aden Protectorate was demar-cated by agreement with the Ottoman Government in 1905. The Imam has never recognised this frontier, and has in fact been encroaching, to a certain extent, upon the protectorate ever since 1921. His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed by treaties, some of them of over forty years&apos; standing, to protect the tribes on the Aden side of the boundary. It has been in the hope of regularising the position, without having recourse to other than diplomatic means, that the negotiations referred to above wei-e instituted. Agreement was very nearly reached last year on the lines of the draft annexed to this memorandum, which ihad been drawn up in consultation with the Foreign Office, India Office, Treasury, Admiralty, &quot;War Office, Air Ministry, and Board of Trade. Before finally agreeing to sign the treaty the Imam suggested that a British representative should be sent to discuss the position with him personally. Sir Gilbert Clayton, who was returning via Baghdad, Bombay and Aden, from his recent successful negotiations with .l.bn Saud, consented to undertake this duty, and is now at Sanaa as the accredited representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Under his instructions he will attempt to induce the Imam to sign the treaty in the :form ;of the annexed draft. He will make it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government do not intend to make any concession in regard to the Aden Protectorate boundary, and has been instructed that while he need not insist, as a condition precedent to signature, on the with-drawal of the Imanfs troops from the Aden Protectorate, he is to impress quite clearly on the Imam the necessity for the immediate withdrawal of all the latter&apos;s troops as an essential corollary of the treaty once it has been signed.It is hoped that, as a secondary consequence of the establishment of permanent relations with the Imam, the interests of British trade in the Yemen may be promoted to the exclusion of certain foreign interests which the Imam has shown a tendency to encourage in the past.L. S. A-Colonial Office, February 8, 1926.[14178]
