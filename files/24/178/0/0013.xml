CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)IffffTDENT IAL.-&apos;- CABINET.P. 13(26). __HOME OFFICE BILLS FOR 1926.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.83Factory Bill.The most important question for consideration as regards legislation for which the Home Office is responsible is whether the Factory Bill shall be introduced this Session or postponed until later.    As the Cabinet are aware,  the original draft of this Bill has been carefully revised with a view to meeting so far as possible the criticism that the conditions imposed on employers were too onerous;    but if any Bill at all is introduced its main object must be to raise the standards of the poorer factories to those adopted in the better factories,   and the question for the Cabinet is whether the present year is an opportune time for the introduction of such a measure.    It will be remembered that a Factory Bill was included In the Election programme of the Conservative Party and in the King&apos;s Speech of December 1924 and there is a section of opinion in the Party which favours the early introduction of this measure.    Any. Bill will,  however, meet-with substantial criticism from the industrial organisations,  and it may be argued that it  is impolitic to lay any additional burdens on trade at the present time when some small signs are visible of trade revival after a long period of depression.There is only one question outstanding as to the provisions of the Bill,  and that is the question of the hours to be fixed for the employment of women and young persons.    On this matter I have been in consultation with the Minister of Labour;,   and if the Cabinet decide in favour of introducing a Bill this year,   1 will circulate a draft of the revised Bill and a memorandum on the hours question.
Lead Paints Bill.This Bill was introduced last Session hut made no progress. The reasons for it are set out in the memorandum which I circulated to the Cabinet in April last  (CP.202(25)).    The object of the Bill is to enable Regulations to be made for the protection of the health of painters using lead paint.    A draft of the Regulations was agreed upon between the Home Office and the industry three years ago.    The Bill will be critioized by the Labour Party on the ground that it does not include any provision as to the prohibition of lead paint for internal work, but I believe there will be no serious objection to the proposal for Regulations. Time ought certainly to be found for this Bill.Coroners Bill.This is a comprehensive Bill for amending the law with regard to Coroners and is based in the main on the Report of the Coroners Committee of 1910, which reported that the existing law   was antiquated and required to be brought into line with modern requirements.    During the Debates in December,  1924, and December, 1925,  on the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, which continues in force two Emergency Acts relating to Coroners&apos;   juries,  I had to promise, as my predecessors had promised, that the question of juries would be dealt with in a permanent amending Bill.The Bill was introduced at the end of last Session for the purpose of eliciting comments and criticisms from persons and authorities concerned.I think there will be no opposition to the general principles of the Bill, but it is a measure of some length containing thirty clauses, and may involve considerable discussion in Committee on points of detail.    For this reason the Bill should be introduced early in the Session.Petroleum Bill.I introduced at the end of last Session a Bill to amend the Petroleum Acts.    This Bill passed the Lords but time could not be
, found for it in the Commona.    The most important object of the Bill is to make better provision for safety precautions during the transport of petroleum.    The Bill has been agreed with the Oil Companies and it is desirable that it should be passed as soon as possible.Police pensions Bill.I introduced at the end of last Session the Police Pensions Bill, which has two objects -  (l) to give statutory effect to the agreement arrived at under the auspices of the Lee Committee and already adopted by the Government to increase from 2-g- to 5 per cent, the statutory rateable deductions from Police pay towards the cost of pensions, and (2) to give effect to the recommendation of the Mackenzie Committee that Police Authorities should be enabled to apply for the benefit of the wives or widows and children of the Police strikers who were dismissed as a result of the strike in 1919 the rateable deductions made from their pay during their service.    The additional deduction for pension, is at present being made under the authority of a statutory Regulation, but this method is only satisfactory as a temporary expedient and it is essential that the agreement come to with the local authorities and the representatives of the men should be fixed by means of an Act of Parliament.    It is unlikely that there will be any substantial opposition to this Bill and it should be included amongst the Bills to be passed early this Session.Wild Birds Bill.This is a consolidating and amending measure based upon the Report of a Departmental Committee of 1919 and upon subsequent suggestions from the Wild Birds Advisory Committee.    The existing law is inadequate and unsatisfactory in many respects and this is a non-Party Bill to which a great deal of thought has been given by Lord Grey of Fallodon,  the Chairman of the Advisory Committee,  and others who are interested in this special subject. Such criticisms of the Bill as have reached me have been on points
of detail and can be easily met.    I understand that certain ofI should he glad if time could be found for the Bill.Legitimacy Bill.This Bill was included in the King&apos;s Speech in December, 1924.    It passed the Lords 8SBd^e-b4^M3^i--a---Se-trcrn6r^erBrd^K-g-in--t-he .&amp;e*ffl&amp;e*is-last. Session but time could not be found for its f^ar-the^aprogress/   I think it should again be introduced in the Lordsearly in the Session and time should be found for it in the Commons.Representation of the People Act  (Amendment) Bill.It had been the intention of the Cabinet to pass a Bill last Session for establishing a single register.    The question whether a Bill for this purpose should be introduced this Session will have to be considered.Child Adoption Bill.This question was recently considered by a Committee of which Mr. Justice Tomlin was Chairman,  and the Committee prepared a draft Bill which I have sent to the Lord Chancellor for his observations.    There is at present no legal provision in English law for the adoption of children and the desirability of legislation on the subject was mentioned in the Prime Minister&apos;s Election Address.    The question of finding time for legislation on this subject should be borne  in mind.Age of Marriage.I am considering the preparation of a short Bill raising the age of marriage, which at present is 12 for girls and 14 for boys.    I believe there would be general support for a Bill raising the age to 13 but I reserve any detailed comments until I have made Certain further enquiries with regard to the question when I propose to circulate a memorandum.the provisions of the Bill would be welcomed by the farmers.
There are two other matters on which the question of Government legislation will have to be considered -(l) Reports of Judicial Proceedings, There will be strong pressure on the Government to take up the question of the regulation of reports of judicial proceedings. Sir Evelyn Cecil&apos;s Bill of last Session passed the Lords and a strong memorial In its favour was presented by over 200 Members of the House of Commons.    To devise a Bill which will effect the objects in view without imposing undue restrictions on the press is a matter of considerable difficulty, but if the Government does not itself legislate, we shall be pressed to give facilities for a Private Member&apos;s measure, and I think the question of framing a measure which the Government can either introduce or accept must be faced.(2) Moneylenders Bill.When Lord Carson&apos;s Moneylenders Bill of last Session was sent to a Select Committee the Government made it clear that the general objects of the Bill had their sympathy.    The Lord Chancellor said &quot;the Government sincerely desire that this matter should be taken up and dealt with&quot;.    Subsequently amendments were moved by the Government to meet departmental criticisms and the Bill passed all its stages in the Lords.    The question should be considered whether this Session the Government will themselves introduce a Bill or will give facilities for a Private Member&apos;s measure,V/..J.H.HOME OFFICE,14th January,   1926..P77-81.
