CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY. 9T$5(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITAiasriO MAJESTY&apos; S GCfiSKiMBET. )S E C R E, T. CP, g2 (26) .LEASEHOLD ENPRA^CHIgEMBST.Memorandum; by the.....Lord Privy Seal.I have examined the Leasehold Enfranchisement bill of 1884 and the debate upon its Second Reading, an extractfrom which tho Chancellor of tho Exchequer has recentlycirculated, to the Cabinet0     The debate is -very instructtive.     I will not dwell upon the ordinary objections it contains to tampering with the conditions of a contract onbehalf ef one of the parties to it at the expense&apos; of theother, because these are obvious.      Such action is alwaysa shook to the convictions of some of the best members ofour Party.     I admit however that there are many examples of the harsh enforcement of these contracts which mayconstitute a good claim for the provision of equitablesafeguards, but surely do not constitute any claim f,$rthe abolition of the rights of wery owner of leaseholdproperty whether he administers them harshly &amp;r not0   Hodoubt I shall be told that for whatever he loses by such legislation every owner would be fully compensated, butthe question is(l)    is such compensation practicable,  and(2)    If it is practicable is leasehold enfranchisement,  even with compensation, for the public advantage?The fundamental difficulty which stands atthe root of all legislation on these lines isimmediately apparent in the debate of 1884.    The freeholdof houses in urban districts is commonly, .if not inthe majority of cases, not owned singly.     In most instancesCopy Kb. .y*J**%J
the houses form -part of blocks, built perhaps many years ago. freeholder,  as the leases fall&quot;11 in, will desire,The normal course isat any ratethat thein all progressive neighbourhoods,  to rebuild them under a uniform scheme-    It is evident that if at any time the tenant of one house of the block is able compulsorily to buy the freehold th e s cheme of rebuilding becomes impossib 1 e .      The frame rs of the Bill of 1884  fthere were- in fact two .Bills but in the following respect I believe they agree) tried to mitigate this  difficulty by providing that there should be no power to enfranchise near the end of a lease, at a time that, is tc say when the owners expectation of realising the advantage of proposed, development would be dangling before his  eyes.     V!ith this object they imposed an Interval of 2 0 years before the. termination of the lease, within which no power of enfranchisement was to be allowed,    I do not suppose that in these days the promoters of leasehold enfranchisement would  look at so long a close time as 2 0 years before the end of the lease.      Probably a shorter interval - say of 5 years - would be accepted.      But whether the interval be long or short it does not meet the weight of the difficulty, because this lies not  in the hardship to the owner - great though that may be - but in the mischief tc the public interest. In point of faot to give the power to any leaseholder to destroy a scheme for rebuilding would strike a blow in all urban districts at building development by private enterprise.&apos; I limit this sentence by the words private enterprise, because I presume that power would always be retained where the Local Authority is the owner to over-ride the leaseholder1 s right of enfranchisement in the interests of development.      But though I presume that this exception would be made I think it
miwould &quot;be in truth indefensible.    Once you have granted the principle that a leaseholder is to have the right to obtain the freehold upon certain terms whenever he pleases, then the ownership of the Local Authority ought not to put him in a worse position than any other leaseholder, at any rate not with-out compensation.      There are I believe variants of this privilege to Local Authorities, put forward to get round the paralysis of development involved in the enfranohisement system, in addition to -ihe exception of property owned by the local Authority itself, namely, in some form or other power for an owner to apply to the Local Authority for exemption from the threat of leasehold enfranchisement on behalf of a particular scheme of development.      But all of them are open to the same reply.      If the hardship of disturbance is to give a leaseholder the right to the freehold then the hardship is no less whether the disturbance Is  threatened by a private owner or by a Local Authority or by a combination of both.This is the greatest difficulty which  stands in the way of leasehold enfranchisement.    But there are others, small by comparison to this one hut nevertheless inxportant in themselves. The landlord Is to be compensated.   Hoi&apos;? is the compensation to be calculated?     Take the case 1 have already put of th o owner-of a block, one house in which It is proposed eompulsorily to enfranchise.    On what principle Is the compensation to bs calculated?     Is the leaseholder to pay only the market value of the house,  or is he to make good all the loss to the owner which the dost ruction of his scheme entails?     The latter alternative is  evidently the  just one,,  but I imagine it would knock the bottom out of the practicability of the system. Then I have just spoken of the market velue of the houseo What Is the market value?     Or rather what would be the market!7    &apos;&apos;. 3*    &apos;       .        ,      - w;    ,
value when &apos;th3 freehold property had become nothing more than tenure during the good pleasure of the leaseholders upon it?     I have no knowledge to read the riddle, but evidently market value as applied in those conditions would be something different and far less than the market value of the same house before leasehold enfranchisement had become the law0      I have spoken of the objection from the&quot;public5s point of view and from the owner&apos;s point of view, but there are also objections from the-point of view of the neighbouring tenants of the same estate.      An estate is worked according to a certain policy, it may be for residential or it may be for business purposes 0     If one house in a residential block is enfranchised and turned into a shop the amenity of the neighbours is infringed.      They will have a grievance because they are deprived of the owner&apos;s protection,,In the earlior part of this Memorandum I have said that the harsh enforcement of the conditions of a lease may constitute a good claim for the provision of equitable safeguards0     If anything is to be done for the leaseholders it is upon these lines    and not the lines of leasehold enfranchisement that I venture to think we ought to proceed.      The case is put of well-established and profitable &quot;businesses upon premises&apos; of which the leases are about to run out,  and attention is&apos;)called to examples of owners who have used these -circumstances in order to wring an unconscionable advance of rent out of the tenants as the price of renewal.    In order to meet such harsh treatment it has been suggested to me that some right of compensation should belong to the tenant.
That has an ugly sound, because it seems to involve the establishment of tribunals such as those of which we have had a melancholy experience in Ireland, and I agree that if it does involve suc.li a consequence the expedient is wholly unacceptable *      I would like however to explore the possibilities of a much rougher form of compensation a sum of money fixed in proportion to the value of the premises as established by the rent, which is not open to dispute,,,      For example it might be provided that whenever an owner^ private or public, refuses to renew a lease of business premises,.  or when the renewal of the lease us refused by the tenant on account of an alleged unfair increase of the rent, a  sum equal to a year - or two years - of the existing rent - of course the rack rent - should be payable by the owner to the tenant, unless the owner would be able to show to the satisfaction of the Courier Court Judge p  in the one case that the tenant had no reasonable doubt for the last five years that the lease would, not be renewed,  or in the other that the increased rent is not unconscionable.      If costs followed the event before the County Court Judge unreasonable litigation would be avoided.      On these lines perhaps harsh enforcement of contracts might be prevented without the damage to the public interest and to the rights of individuals involved, in leasehold enfranchisement.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.I.9th February,  192 6,
