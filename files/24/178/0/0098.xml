&apos; CONFIDENTIAL ILIBRARY.   copy No. 3aSPJiil. CABINET,J?, 97 (26). HOME AFFAIRS OOMCTTEE.PUBLIC HEALTH (SMOKE ABATEMENT) BILL. ^08Memorandum by- the Secretary for Scotland.I refer to the last paragraph of the memorandum of the Minister of Health of the 4th Maroh, 1926, (CP.87 ( 26).   As there indicated, it is necessary to have special clauses applicable to Scotland only, viz., clauses 6-8 and 14,    Of these clauses, 6 and 14 deal with tho administrative machinery for carrying out the pro-visions   -it the Act in Scotland;   clauses 7 and 8 are &quot;Saving&quot; and &quot;Repeal&quot; clauses.Clause 6 is of more importance:   it re-enacts with modifications and extends to counties tho provisions of section 384 of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1892.   tinder that Aot it is enough for the prosecutor to prove the omission of smoke, and the enus is then thrown on the defence to prove that the leest practical means for preventing smoke, etc., aro adopted, whoreas under the English Public Health Act, which the Bill purports to amend, and tho [   e or responding Scottish Public Health Act, the onus is on the proseou-ticn to prove the emission of smoke in such quantity as to be a nuisance, etc.   It may be therefore that tho Scottish provisions of the Bill are more drastic than the English, but the existing Scottish law in burghs, whioh are most likely to be affected, is already more drastic than the existing English law, and in this connection I would refer to clause 2, under which the  onus in England ef disproving a nuisance may be thrown on the defence.&apos;JOHN GILTOR&apos;.sottish Office. 6th  March, 1926,
