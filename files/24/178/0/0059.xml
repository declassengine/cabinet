CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,j C E li L58 ( 6).. Copy Ho.    6 OQ A B IJ piLPACIFIC,   ClBLa    BILL.T*B% TBiiASUSfT        &quot; 7;3331.      The pacific Cahle Board, administers on behalf of the Imperial Government and of the Governments of Canada, Australia and New Zealand the cable system in the Pacific connecting the Dominions named.2.     The Board has recently duplicated its main cable at a cost of  2,750,000,  the whole of which is being provided from its Reserve Fund.     tinder the Pacific Cable. Act, 1911, the Board must now set aside as part of its annual expenses such sums as will be sufficient to repay within 35 years the amount drawn from the Reserve Fund with interest at the rate of 3-g- per cent per annum.3.     This statutory requirement is entirely unreasonable in the circumstances,  2,750,000 accumulating at 3f per cent for 35 years would amount to over  9,000,000 and there is no possible object in the board accumulating such a huge reserve. The annual payment required ( 146,150) would be a crippling burden on the Board5s Budget,     Any annual deficit resulting would fall to be shared by tho partner Governments,  involving in the case of Great Britain (-whose share would be 5/l8tha) a Parliamentary Vote.     liven if a deficit were not actually caused the effect would be to divert to reserve, profits which would otherwise be applied - under statute - to accelerating the repayment by the Board of the capital originally advanced by this country for the construction of the cable.4.     The draft Bill alleviates the Board&apos;e position by limiting the amount to be repaid to the Reserve Fund
within. 85 years to the- sum actually drawn out viz.,  2,75.0,000 The annual payment necessary for this purpose os  45,000 which is reasonable.5.      The draft Bill was approved by the Pacific Gable Board at its last meeting.6,      It is necessary that the Bill should be passed not later than August and I accordingly ask for authority for its Introduction.      If the Bill is not passed by August the Board will have no option but to place to Reserve this year the full amount necessary to satisfy the conditions of the 1911 Act.      This would almost certainly involve a deficit on their budget this year and necessitate a supplementary estimate being laid before Parliament,R. Moll.Tre asury Chamber s, 10 &quot;February, 1926.
