OOAL.SIR ADAM NIMMO said it would bo remembered that at the last two meetings he had reported quite a steady improvement In the ooal industry. He thought that improvement was continuing, although perhaps not quite in so marked a way as it had been during the previous three months. Those, however, who were working In the industry believed that it would go on certainly for some months.The figures seemed to bear out that view, because for December 1925, the output of the United Kingdom was nearly 221- million tons, whilst for December 1924, it had been 22 million tons.   We had to keep in mind that the slump in the industry did not begin to show itself markedly until well into 1925 The weekly outputs from the beginning of this year showed that we were holding our own quite well.   The figures were very nearly the same as they had been for the corresponding period of 1925 -14,572,000 tons up to the week ending 16th January, as against 14,531,000 tons for the corresponding period in 1925.    It appeared, indeed, that we were now in a better position than we had been.The unemployment figures were also better than they had been at the lowest point, whioh was about June 1925.   And In December 1925, from the point of view of the working time, the position was not relatively worse than in December 1924.    5.46 days a week were worked in December 1925, as against 5.36 days per week in December 1924.Sir Adam Nimmo thought that the collieries were fairly well placed in regard to orders up to the end of April, and that a good   deal of substantial business oould be done during the rest of the year if we knew what was going to happen at the end of April.   There is no doubt that the uncertainty as to the situation after the end of April was preventing both buyers from dealing with business and coalowners from being willing to contract for the rest of the year.There appeared to be in some quarters what might be called an un-british view as to the possibilities of trade in coal. It was being pressed on the country that we must expect to do leas business in coal than we did.    Sir A. Nlromo did not think that was a sound view. It was only a question of the relative price at which the trade was to be done.    If we were going to say that the price was to be some shillings per ton above the true economic price, of course, we oould not expect to do the trade; but experience in recent months had shown that we should not be content with such a position. It was on this point that the McMillan Report went, in his opinion, grievously astray.    That Report was based on the position that the trade could not be got at any price, and that it was no use trying to bring down the cost of production because the trade was not there. The experience we had had, however, since then had proved conclusively that this was an unsound view. Sir Adam believed that it would spell a great disaster for the industry, and a greater disaster for the oountry, and he was one of those who would like to combat it.
CONFIDENTIAL.COAL (CONTD.)As he hed indicated before, he thought it would be found that the subsidy would have reached its peak in December, and that the country could look forward, as far as could be foreseen, to a lessening subsidy during the coming months until the whole difficulty that was in front of us had been got rid of.   In his own district in Scotland they were able to pay 7$ more In rages on the owners1 position in February than they had been in January.   It was due, of course, to the larger output of coal that we were getting, aid to the expansion in our markets; and if we could go on with that policy the economic situation which the Government would have to deal with at the end of April would be easier than might have been anticipated a couple of months ago,Mr. GALLAGHER said that the Scottish Co-operative Whole-sale Society had had prepared a very full summary of the coal trade over a very long period, from the consumer s point of view.   They were anxious about what was going to happen in Scotland, and they desired to see for themselves what the whole tendency had been during a course of years.He thought the figures bore out that the price of coal all through since 1913, and particularly since 1920, had a very considerable influence on the sale.   The sales had, generally speaking, gone up and down in something like an inverse ratio to the price movements.   For the year 1920, which was a very good year until the slump came late in that year, their turnover was 326,039 tons, the value being  449,911, The average price was 27/7d per ton.   That was a pitmhead price and this coal was a good medium quality household coal, 80% of it, the rest being   slack used for factories.    The average was pretty constant through all the years.    In 1920 the Government de-controlled, and in 1921, which was a- very bad year after de-control and reductions in wages,  the turnover fell to 241,700 tons, of the value of  360,869, the average price rising to 30/6 per ton.   In April 1921 there was  a miners&apos;  strike, and the Government assumed control of all available supplies.    In 1922 there was a very sharp drop in the price of coal, to 2l/6d from 30/6&apos;d.a drop of 9/- per ton, and there was a sharp increase in the Society&apos;s turnover to 283,552 tons and the value of was  304,281.   By 1922 they were beginning to feel very severely the reductions in wages and the decreased purchasing power of the people of the country.    In 1923 there was a boom at the beginning of the year.   It should be noted that they had a fairly constant number of purchasers, and fairly constant sales to the Retail Co-operative Societies of about 6,000 tons a week.    In January 1923 there was a boom in the coal trade owing to the occupation of the Ruhr by France, and the price rose to 23/5d.   The Scottish Society1s turnover during 1923 was 295,944 tons, and the value  346,876.   During 1923 they had a very good time in coaltand there   seemed to be good prospeots.    In 1924 there was a very good period right up to the beginning of May,   The average price rose to 27/10 from 23/5d.   The turnover rose to 307,185    tons in spite of the fact that the price had gone up.    1924 seemed to be a good period, and things looked very well Indeed, and the value rose to  427,666 .    That was the highest point they had had until they went back to 1919,   In March 1925 there
$ f confidential. &apos; * -COAL  (CONTD .) .were, threats of a strike and there were considerable sales of coal as against that, but in May the Government intervened and the subsidy, about that time, was determined upon.   There was a steady decline in the trade from May right on, until at the end things were very bad indeed, .&quot; There was a fall of4/- per ton from 27/10 to 23/10,   That made an average percentage cf 14%.    The value fell to  389,083, a fall of 9% in the total value of the coal sold.   The   turnover rose to 326,573 tons, an increase of &amp;%.    One could see that, broadly speaking, one thing compensated for another; a decreased price had resulted in an increased sale, but not just to the extent that the price might warrant, and these figures went to show that when the price of a commodity was raised without increasing the purchasing power of the consumer, things righted themselves eventually by a decrease in the sale of the commodity,As regards the war period; in 1913 his Society had sold 316,143 tons of coal of the value of  241,977, the average price being 14/8d per ton.   It was 14/8d a ton in 1914.   It rose to 18/4d in 1915, 20/8d in 1916, 2l/- in 1917, 24/9d in 1918, and 24/6d in 1919.   He would merely make this point, that the increase in 1925 over 1913 in the price of coal corresponded closely with the increase in the cost of living, or if one put it the other way, to the  decrease In the purchasing power of currency.   It was an increase of exactly 58^, which approached very closely the Increased cost of living, so that the deduction to be made was that the economic value of coal to-day, considering the decreased value of currency, was approximately the same as it had been in 1913.   It appeared that if the coal trade was to revive In this country something would have to be done to give us cheaper coal.IRON AND STEEL.MR. BAKER stated that the movement of these trades was tending upwards.   Prices were hardening and there were rumours of further furnaces being blown In,   In the heavy steel trade manufacturers were in the same difficulty as other manufacturers, - they did not know what was going to happen next May, and they were, therefore, a little dubious about booking orders.   Last year we consumed more steel in this country than in 1913, but, of course, our exports were down, while our imports were up.   Ship plates were recently reported to have increased in price by 2/6d per ton, making the price  7,7.6d,, which could not, however, be considered remunerative. The sliding scale which governed the wages of the major portion of the workers in the heavy steel trades showed a reduction of Qi% for the three months commencing next Sunday.   That would leave that scale at about 2Q^% above base, but it was already ll\% above that base in 1914, so that their wages were now about 15% or 16% above 1914.The United States steel trade was reported to be producing up to 84/f of capacity and Germany to have produced in 1925 69% of the total 1913 output of pre-war Germany, but orders In Germany fell off in the latter part of the year and unemployment was increasing t    This appeared to be broadly the position of the heavy steel trade at the present moment *
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.).MR. DQRMAN observed that our importe of Iron and Steel In December were on a very high level, practically, a quarter of a million tons, while the exports were a little better also in December, at nearly 341,000 tons.    Mr. Baker had mentioned the pig iron position as being a little better.    This was quite correct.    The stocks of pig iron in the country were, no doubt, at a very low level, but it was necessary also to look at the production in 1913 and compare it with the present production of pig iron.    It would be seen that the production at the present time had greatly diminished.    Some blast furnaces would undoubtedly have to be blown in.    Mr. Dorman&apos;s own firm were giving orders to put two blast furnaces in, but they did it with some doubt, owing to the coal position. Naturally if a firm spent  7,000 or  8,000 on the lining of blast furnaces, and put a new blast furnace in, they did not want to feel that they would have.to put It out again in May; nevertheless they had got to take a risk in some of these matters.As regards steel, consumers were buying from hand to mouth, which made it very difficult to get specifications for keeping the mills running on full-time.    Orders were being placed in spasmodic fashion.    Shipbuilding, which was of course one of the mainstays of the steel trade, was still in a depressed condition on the north-east coast.    A very few new orders had been placed there, but some orders had been given on the Clyde.In Belgium there had been a strike for some time, but it was now passing away, and this would very likely have the result of making the Belgians keener competitors.    They are putting in blast furnaces in addition, teut one hoped that there would be room for the total output of both oountrles.The constructional engineering trade was still busy but was quieter, not so many new orders having been placed.    The same remark applied to galvanised sheets which had had a wonderful run of prosperity.      The orders there were not now so plentiful, but all the galvanised sheet makers were well held for the next two months.    The wire trade was dull and in a difficult position.    The imports of wire rod were very heavy, and the future was a little doubtful at the moment.Generally speaking, Mr. Dorman thought it might be taken that the trade on the whole was better, if only because--the pig iron position was stronger.STEEL.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR remarked that the industries he always spoke of were not those dealing with heavy steel, but were the higher class steel trades, Including all the tools used In every kind of engineering shop and textile works, etc.:    The January figures for export would probably just about come up to those of January last year, and would not be any better. He thought that in many places, certainly in Sheffield, manufacturers had made a big effort to improve their December figures and had sometimes really robbed January in filling up December.
STEEL  (CONTD.).Generally speaking, the average of the trades in question was fairly good, but their condition was very patchy.    Trade fell off heavily, and then it came back again; but the average today was better than the average of January of last year.What Mr. Landale said about Southern China was very serious indeod (see the section &quot;Trade in China&quot;).    If this state of things went on very much longer British traders would certainly lose their goodwill in China because the demand there now was that trade should be done without any British marks on the goods.    That was a very serious matter, and perhaps more serious in China than in any other country.The Canadian trade was very much better; and no doubt due to the great prosperity in the United States, there was less competition from that country.    The Australian and New Zealand trade was good.    South Africa was about normal. The South American trade was very much better.   British firms were now getting a much higher percentage of the tenders they quoted for, particularly in competition with Germany. In fact, they were getting about seven-eights of those they quoted for, whereas a little while ago they were only getting a half or less than a half.On the Continent, Germany had gone to pieces altogether. Before that, Sheffield had begun to do quite a good steel trade there again, but that was almost closed now; there were so few people in that oountry whom one could trust with credit that it was difficult now to do any serious business. The trade with France was almost nil.   What with the co-efficients on the tariff and the Exchange, French business was practically hopeless. Their price was about 16 to our 39. On the other hand, Italy, in spite of the exchange, was very much better.   British trade with that country had improved in high class steel manufactures in a very extraordinary manner, particularly when the state of the exchange was taken into consideration. Spain was good, Portugal bad.    The Russian trade was very difficult, and very fluctuating.    They were demanding very long credits and exceptional terms. Some people here were doing the trade and taking the risks, others were leaving the trade alone. The home trade was decidedly better^. There was a very big inflow of home trade orders, whioh were not large, but were steady.In the alloys trade, which reflected the steel trade, the war stocks were only now- beginning to be exhausted^ consequently, there was now likely to be a considerable rise in price.    It had, however,  taken the whole of the years since the war to make a real impression on these war stocks.Generally speaking, the position was fairly hopeful, but very patohy.    One would not like to say what it was going to be next month, although there were signs  that the export for next month in the particular trades which were being referred to, would, on the whole, be better than for February of last year.
NON-FERROUS METALS.SIR CECIL BUDD observed that there was very little to say about the non-ferrous trade.    There was nothing very satisfactory and nothing very unsatisfactory.    They had been very quiet for two months, but that was not very unusual at the beginning of the year.    Some of the industries were wanting new orders, and on the whole, although Sir Cecil did not expect quite as good a year in these industries as last, whioh all circumstances considered was a very good one, he thought the prospects were fairly satisfactory.ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING.SIR PHILIP NASH thought there was nothing special to report since the last meeting of the Council.    The Home market for electrical machinery had remained last year at about the same level as the year before.    Both those years were about 20$ worse than 1923.    It seemed likely that this year the home trade would remain at about the same level.    As regards the export market, there had been a very much improved position in respect to the amount of work that had oome to this country.      In 1923, in heavy electrical machinery 21,000 tons were exported from this country, and in 1925, 33,000 tons. But as against the increase in tonnage of about 58$,  the increase in value had only been about 48$.    There had been a sagging of prices.    There had been, on the other hand, a large increase in the imports of what is known in the Board of Trade Returns as electrical goods.    These were understood not to be machinery, but electrical appliances, wireless apparatus and fittings, and so forth.    The figures showing the declared value of these imports, had risen from  2,400,000 in 1923 to  4,300,000 in 1925, which was nearly double.One feature of the export trade which the Council might like to know of is this, that the most modern and the most up-to-date plant manufactured in this country was for orders abroad.    In this country a demand for high tension electrical apparatus and big size turbines and so forth did not exist, and would not exist for many years, but our manufacturers were familiar with that class of work because of the experience they had gained in executing orders for countries which had larger areas, and larger distances over which to transmit electricity.       As regards prices, at the moment undoubtedly Swiss prices and Swedish prices were depressing all world prices because in those countries they were hungry for work. Switzerland had a capacity out of all proportion to her own home market, and to fill the Swiss workshops they would require to get about 80$ of their work from outside their own country.
C0NFI2EHTI.AL&quot;SHIPBUILDING.SIR JAMES LITHOOW sent a message to the following effect:-There certainly had been a slight revival in the placing of new contracts at home, but this had to be considered in conjunction with the fact that the last quarter was the worst &quot;we had had for many years, and that more orders had been placed abroad than in this country.    In Sir J.Lithgow&apos;s opinion this had not been caused by a genuine demand (as the freight markets were worse than ever), but was due to far-reaching reductions In cost abroad, and he looked upon this as a confirmation of his contention that it was our higher costs in Great Britain which were the principal cause of the unemployment hore.TEXTILES:^COTTON.SIR V/. CLARE LESS thought that the position in Manchester might best be described by the word Sir Arthur Balfour had used &quot;patchy&quot;.    There had been decided changes of a patchy kind in one market and another during the last month.    Generally speaking,  the position seemed to be that,  for the time being, a very heavy volume of inquiry was maturing in orders in isolated markets^Germany was distinctly and definitely worse.    The restriction there was, as far as one could judge,  entirely financial-    Largo quantities of goods ready for export to Germany were waiting here until the last lot shipped had been paid for,  and until that financial stringency was relieved that market would remain bad.Syria and Egypt were still congested owing to the troubles in Syria.    The Moroccan market was very dull, but not necessarily at all unhealthy, and Improvement could be looked for there.The Calcutta side of the Indian markets had been buying strongly, and fairly persistently     It looked as if the Calcutta market was feeling confidence.    On the other hand, Bombay and other parts had not been displaying that confidence, although they had been making large   inquiries for the .finest kinds of goods and as a consequence, the finishers had done quite a fair amount of businessThere was more business going on with China, but of a spotty character, nothing like big buying or anything of that sort, but we ought to remember that an increase of exports to China would not necessarily mean an increase of orders for Lancashire, because there was a very large accumulation of heId-back goods.    Still,  there had been quite considerable orders for finishing processes going through for China during the last few days.South America was keeping quite good, and on tho whole it looked as though we are creeping back into orders, but slowly.
CONFIDENTIAL.   &apos; TEXTILES:      COTTON (0ONTD) .COL. SEDDON BRO&apos;v.N said that in the spinning trade the Egyptian section in the fine counts was a little better, certainly better than a month ago, and the mills were engaged full time, but there was not the same margin of profit as there had been say, six months ago, and the margins were certainly being cut*     As regards the American section of the spinning trade, there was one bright spot, the figures showed that the sales for the last two weeks had more nearly approached production than for a great many months past. In spite of that fact, American yams were being sold without any profit on the Exchanges and the mills were working short time.The cloth trade was certainly bad, and any standard cloth could be bought in Lancashire at a price which showed an absolute loss to the manufacturer.     The trade with China In cloth had, however, shown some signs of improvement, and India had been buying rather better, especially in light fabrics.The Industry was    suffering severely from the loss of the     German trade.     The very best customers whom they had trusted for years in Germany were now totally unable to pay. It was one of our greatest markets and now one hardly dared sell any yarn there from Lancashire.   The German banks were, however, using every effort to let German traders have money on a more reasonable basis.     In June or July there were people in Germany who were paying 12% for overdraft rates.     Those were good firms j small firms were paying up to 20%.   &apos; It had been reported, however, during the last few days that overdraft rates had been secured at 7$.     If that was true it would help trade *MR. JudSON remarked that, as regards the spinning section, since the Council&apos;s last meeting, if there had been any change at all things had gone worse.     During the last week the hours per week had been reduced by 8-f, making the working hours 30^ now as against the full time hours of 48   per week.TEXTILES: WOOL.  &apos; MR. ANDREWS wrote as follows:-&quot;At the Meeting a month ago, I reported that the slight improvement noticed during October and&apos; November had continued. I regret to say I cannot report any realextension of this slight Improvement, but the position is fully maintained.     Raw material is a little lower still in price than in December, and this Is all to the good in looking forward to the future for the production of cloth at a reasonable price.&quot;The Wool Combing Section is better employed than at any time during the last nine months.&quot;Spinners are fairly well employed, but the future is not any too bright. They have sufficient orders on hand to keep them going a little longer.   They are fully employed in the1 Merino Section, which is mostly for the Home
CONFIDENTIAL.  &apos; TEXTILES: WOOL  (OONTD.).Trade, but are badly in need of new orders in the Cross Bred Seotion, whioh Is largely dependent upon orders from the Continent.    The demand for Yarn for Germany is fairly good, but Spinners are afraid to accept the orders because of their Inability to collect monies already owing to them.&quot;The Weaving Section is fully as good as a month ago, if anything a little better, having more Looms at work than at any time during the last six months.&quot;The Unemployment throughout the whole of the Worsted Section of the Trade shows a slight improvement.    The heavy Woollen Trade is still very bad,  and there are no signs of improvement in that section.    No doubt a good deal of this is caused by the disturbance in the Far East&quot;.POTTERY.MR. HOLLINS thought that at the moment the position in . the potteries was very hopeful.   Looking back on the Board of Trade re-turns for last year it was seen that exports were keeping up fairly well.    There had been a Blight fall in quantity and a rather heavier one in values; but compared with the total exports it was a very small percentage.    It was stated that this year the bookings of orders were muoh better for the beginning of the year than they had been for some time and the prospeots for the future were good.The Finished Pottery Manufacturers1 Federation, along with the National Society of Pottery Workers, had realised that during the years succeeding 1914 the constant rises and falls of wages had had a tendency to disturb the confidence of the market,  and- last year the employers and the workers got together and agreed not to exchange notices.    This year again they had an arrangement for continuing the Wage Bill, until March, 1927.GENERAL TRADE. MR. MACRTN wrote as follows:-&quot;From reports received the position appears to have changed but little since we last met.    A feeling of hopeful optimism undoubtedly exists in most trades and I personally believe that this Is justified.    There is nothing in the -nature of a boom although the volume of trade does seem to me fairly well maintained.    The one great cloud on the horizon is in connection with the coal industry.    If we can be assured that thiB matter can be settled without an industrial upheaval, I am satisfied we can look forward to a decided improvement all round&quot; .GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING.MR. TENNANT handed in the reports from the Branches of the Westminster Bank, with regard to general trade.   He thought that on the whole they showed further improvements, with the exoeption, however, that in the wool and cotton industries no particular improvement seemed to have taken place.
GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING  (CONTD.).With regard, to the money market at the beginning of January,  owing to the rise in the Federal Reserve Bank rate there had been great apprehension that our Bank Rate might go up, but during the month the Exchanges had all moved in our favour,   and now that apprehension appeared to have been removed.    The Bank of England, during the last week, had gained a considerable amount of gold.   There had been a considerable number of issues during the month - foreign issues amounting to about  9,000,000, Empire issues to about  4-g- millions, and of course  a good many domestic issues in this country.SIR FELIX SCHUSTER had not much to add to what Mr .Tennant had said.    There was progress in certain directions, but he did not think that the branch reports of the National Provincial Bank showed that it was so very marked.   There was improvement in the Boot trade and in the Potteries, and also from Lancashire they had got some better reports; and the China market was brighter than might have been expected in existing circumstances.   Then, of course, our coal    exports were pretty large, and the home trade was also better, but some of the branch reports observed that this might be merely precautionary in view of possibilities.On the whole,  although progress was still to oe expected, one could not say from these reports that it had really been attained, we were just marking time.The money market looked healthier.    There v.ere new issues, and plenty of them still coming, and several big foreign loans; nevertheless the market seemed fairly well able to absorb them, particularly when they yielded a high rate of interest.    The fear of a further rise in money rates seemed to be removed for the time being.   The Dutch Exchange, which ha d been improving very well,  md got above gold point, had fallen away again.    One could not speak with very great confidence, but still the general feeling was that rates for money would be cheaper before very long.SHIPPING.SIR ALAN ANDERSON observed that the  tonnage under construction during the quarter ended last December as compared with the December quarter in the previous year was down by roughly one-third - the figures were 1,300,000 tons for the December quarter of 1924, as against 900,000 tons for that of 1925.   Coal exports were lower in 1925 than the year before, as also were the shipments of bunker coal,    The tonnage launched in the quarter ending December 1925 was 216,000, while a year earlier it was 353,000.   The tonnage commenced during the same quarter was 160,000 tons in 1925, and 190,000 in the previous year.
SHIPPING    (CONTD.)Perhaps a slackening in the production of tonnage was not wholly a bad thing from the shipowners&apos; point of view, but it did not show good prospects.   On the other hand, the laid-up tonnage, which was very high in the summer and autumn of 1925, decreased sharply towards the end of last year - it was 407,000 tons on January 1st last as against 488,000 tons on the previous January 1st, not a very greaty reduction, but in the meantime it had been very much higher, up to 770,000 tons in July.    Freights for the month of December 1924, were 28$ of 1920, and for December 1925, 27$.    There had been probably a slight reduction in the level of expenses, but there again the freights had in the meantime touched a considerably lower point.In the matter of Trade Facilities as regards loans for shipbuilding, shipowners would very much like some of their number to be on the Committee when these loans were discussed.    They felt that their business was very seriously affected by the granting of loans for shipbuilding, and that it would be a good thing if they had a chance of expressing their views.     They would agree to ship-builders being consulted also.    As to wireless, it seemed to shipowners that if the automatic alarm signal matured, as they hoped it would it was going to be a very great improvement- in securing safety at sea;    but they trusted that the Board of Trade would not want to make it a compulsory fitting, at any rate until it was fully tested and other nations made it compulsory also.    It was a fitting which ought to relieve the shipowner, and his inclination would therefore be to adopt it as Boon as he possibly could.    On the other hand, it was a tricky thing, and there were only a few makers;    and they did not want to be put in the pocket of some inventor of apparatus.Again, there was the Convention for the limiting of shipowners&apos;  liability.    In 1913,  the Pilotage Aot took away the power of the shipowner to defend himself from claims on the ground that pilotage was compulsory. That was an agreed change, shipowners consented to the removal of that defence, and the Government of the day agreed that they would support an international Convention for putting right the rules about the liability of ship-owners which, as.was well known, are very unequal over the world.    The removal under the Pilotage Act of the defence of compulsory pilotage was deferred for five years to give time for that Convention to be brought in.    Then the war came and that caused delay;    the defence of oompulsory pilotage had since gone, and tie Convention had not yet matured.     Other nations, however, it was under-stood, were now nearly ready to enter into a Convention, so that our shipowners were hoping that the British Government would support the Convention and push it on. They thought it would be of considerable help.
CONFIDENTIAL. &quot;     s n *1jc i-a a.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.MR.  HURCOMB observed that the railway receipts for the first three weeks of the year were  107,000 less than those for the corresponding period of 1925.    There was an increase of  19,000 in passenger traffic and a decrease of  126,000 in goods,  resulting in this net decrease of  107,000.MR. PHILLIPS said that the unemployment figure at the end of January was  just over 1,200,000,  or about 62,000 more than at tho end of December.    There was,  as usual, a large increase at Christmas and the New Year, and the figures had fallen by about 51,000 from the peak figure of 4th January.Of those registered on 25th January 915,000 were recorded as wholly unemployed,  222,000 as temporarily stopped and 64,000 as casuals.    It was significant and perhaps rather disquieting that the number wholly unemployed on 25th January was only 2,000 less than at the beginning of January,  and casuals actually 4,000 more,  so that practically all the decrease of 51,000 in January was accounted for by absorption of those temporarily stopped.The Ministry of Labour had now had this new analysis of the unemployment figures for seven weeks and though it was early yet to draw conclusions,  one point that seemed to. emerge was that the figures for those temporarily suspended fluctuates much more violently than the others;    thus,  in the seven weeks the highest figure for those temporarily suspended was 50 per cent, above the lowest, while the highest figure for those wholly unemployed was only 9 per cont. above the lowest.    The effect of Christmas short time was evident here; but,  so far as they went, the figures seemed to show that the main fluctuations were in the numbers on short time rather than in those wholly unemployed.SHOPPING, WEEKS: EMPIRE GOODS.THE PRESIDENT observed to Mr.Sanderson that the question had been put to him to what extent,  if a town were organizing a Shopping Week,  they could get displays of Empire goods for shop windows from Dominion Offices or Dominion organisations. The President was. not quite sure to what extent that had already been arranged for.    In any case,   it might be worth while considering whether anything further could be done in that way.MR.  SANDERSON said that for some weeks past, if not for some months,  this matter had been under consideration at Australia House and a great many efforts had been made to deal with it,  but some difficulties connected with it had not yet quite been overcome.
AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON reported that this was the time of year in Australia when very dry conditions were prevalent;   there had,  however, been some good rainfalls in Queensland, but it would be a month or two yet before the rains were due.   The prospects for beef were fairly bright, but sheep and lamb exports were restricted, me.inly owing to market values.     The prices for butter for local consumption in Australia were considerably in excess of those for export, and the difference was being refunded to exporters by the producers themselves under the Patterson Scheme,  one result of which was that the British consumer got butter cheaper than the Australian consumer.   The Queensland Government had again announced its intention to form a Ootton Pool Board,   Mainly owing to the very dry conditions throughout October, there would be a decreased area under Cotton as compared with last year, but subject to weather conditions being favourable, it was expected that better results would be obtained from the decreased area.Figures in connection with the Broken Rill mining operations showed very good results during 1925.     Wages there had been regulated by a sliding scale and were on an upward grade, while the year had been quite free from industrial troubles.   The high prices for lead,  silver and spelter,  together with an increased tonnage of ore raised, should result in making the value of production for 1925 greatly exceed that for the previous year, which totalled five and a half million sterling.   All mines along the Broken Hill line worked continuously during the year.     The ore raised at Broken Hill during the year amounted to about one and a quarter million tons, an increase of nearly 200,000 tons over 1924, while in December the employees totalled 5,858,  or 450 more than for the corresponding period of 1924.   Apart from Broken Hill,  the mining industry in Australia generally was decidedly depressed, particularly the gold and coppe r mines *......Wool prices had fallen since December, but the market seemed fairly steady at a lower level of prices.     The National Council of V ool Selling Brokers stated that taking the actual receipts for 1925-1926,  the clip in the stores at 31st December last,  and estimating the balance expected to be received, the clip would total 2,1200,000 bales,  of which 1,273,000 bales remained unsold at 31st December.     About 150,000 bales were sold in January so that there wer^ a little over one million bales still to sell.INDIAN TRADE.MR. LlNi-SAY said that the calendar year figures of Indian trade had just come in,  and they showed a total of 633 crores, say about  475,000,000,  in exports and imports, of which roughly one-third were imports and two-thirds exports.   The margin between the two had increased very materially during the   past three years in favour of India.   The natural corrective to&quot; that balance of trade would have been a rise in the exchange,,
INDIAN TRADE  (CONTD).tending to discourage exports and encourage imports, and the exchange had, in fact, risen Appreciably, from l/4d early in 1923 to over&apos;l/6d. to-day.     That was a rise of over 12f$. In spite of that rise, however, the exports had continued to increase and imports had remained fairly steady.     The reason was chiefly to be found in a succession of good monsoons in India, but there was also the fact that prices in the London market had tended to rise for a number of India&apos;s staple exports.     Their tea, coffee,  jute, mang-anese, tin and wolfram -were all getting very good prices.A survey had been taken the other day for the Commerce Department at Delhi of the position of India&apos;s staple goods in the London market, and it was found that they fell into three classes; the first class, grains, oil seede,hides and skins,-was getting prices about 40% above the pre-war levels; the second class,- fibres, jute,cotton, hemp and wool,- was getting prices about 60$ above pre-war;   and in the third class there was a wide range of goods whioh had been rather favourably treated In London - tea, coffee, shellac, manganese, tin and wolfram - all staple Indian goods, which are getting about 80% above pre-war prices-.     So India&apos;s wholesale price index number of 160, as it stood at present, which was 60% above pre-war, was the mean of these three different groups.   For the difficulty which India   had in purchasing at present there appeared to be two reasons.     Firstly, with the rise in the Rupee, Rupee prices of Imported goods had been steadily falling; and secondly this tendency had merely accentuated the fall in the world&apos;s market price for manufactured goods.     It was quite obvious-that no dealer in India could buy for stock on a falling market, for he would be defeated by his competitor next month, and that was the chief reason why India had not been buying during the past three years.     She had bought from hand to mouth as her requirements materialised, and the result was that her purchases had been comparatively steady.Statistics had been taken   out to show the proportions in which India produced, on the one hand, grains and oil seeds, which were getting only 40% above the pre-war prices,and on the other hand, tea, coffee, tobacco, and so on.   Out of a total of 234,000,000 acres under cultivation in India 211,000,000 are under food, grains and oil seeds, while the rest, 23,000,000 acres only, were under every other variety of crop - cotton, jute, sugar, tea, tobacco,indigo, opium, and coffee.The pieoe goods situation in India was not good so far as the local mills are concerned.     Several mills had not re-opened In Bombay, in spite of the abolition of the Cotton ... Excise Duty, and there was a rumour that two more closed down on the 1st of this month.      It was understood that out of a total of 200,000 hands normally employed at the Bombay mills, at least 10% were out of employment, and probably more.At the last meeting of the advisory Committee of the Department of Overseas Trade Mr. Lindsay had given some figures showing how the piece goods trade from this country to India had tended to pass in the hands of the bazar, that is to say
INDIAN TRADE  (CONTD.),out of the hands of the old established Indian and European firms in India Into the hands of the less well-known and perhaps less reliable firms .   A summary of these figures is appended :-Total trade of Calcutta in imported ple^e-goods in January-October 1913 ........599,471 bales,of which the bazar accounted for 127,060 bales.Total trade in January-October, 1925..... 322,016 bales,of which the bazar accounted for 146,022 bales.Finally, the British share of the&apos; Iron and steel trade had advanced considerably during the past year.   The British proportion of imports in this trade before the War was roughly 60 j last summer It was 65$,  and the figures just received showed that it was now about 70%.TRADE IN SOUTH AMERICA.MR. HOSE considered that the position in South America generally might be considered to be rather good   rom the point of view of the likelihood of their buying more goods from England.   Chile had had its reserve bank properly established and this was now open; gold had been deposited and notes were being issued.    They had also had excellent Customs returns for last year, superior to those of the year before.   Chile had raised a lot of money&quot;in London lately and her credit here seemed to be particularly good.The new Brazilian loan was interesting because it had been done through the so-called Coffee Institute, which was a new creation of the Brazilian Government for the purpose of placing in their hands what was practically the control of the coffee trade.   That would remove the trade from the hands of the merchants who formerly had It and place - it In the hands of the Coffee Institute.   This step would probably greatly assist the finances of the Coffee business, which was at present paying sometimes 18% per annum for advances.In the Argentine there was not quite such a good story. They had a very heavy attack of Black Rust on the wheat in the Northern Provinces and that had spread to the South. It was said that, in consequence, the exportation of wheat for the year would be likely to amount to something nearer two million than the five million tons which were estimated some four or five months ago.   But it was not unusual to find these estimates fluctuating right up to the point of the actual harvest, and there was also the possibility of a compensating maize crop.Peru was not doing very well at present.    They had a considerable  credit stringency and their exports of Cotton and Sugar had been lower.
&amp;2K.\*TRADE IN CHINA.MR. LANDALE said &quot;that as regards imports,  there was a better demand for Manchester goods in Shanghai and, generally speaking, import business in that part of the country was improving.      In Hongkong and the South matters still remained at a deadlock and very little business was being done.      In some cases Manchester goods delivered in November against sales made before the boycott had been shipped by Chinese to Shanghai,  the British marks had been removed and the goods stamped &quot;made in Germany&quot; and re-shipped by Chinese steamers to Canton.      In the matter of exports, there was very little demand in Europe for the usual export of Seeds and Hides from China.    The Continent, more particularly Germany, did not seem to be in a position to buy anything, and prices in China were above these in India, due, no doubt, to difficulty in moving produce from up-country under existing disturbed conditions.British Shipping on the China Coast was still very much hampered by the condition of affairs in Canton and Swatow, where no British ships could call at present.The extra-mural section of the Peking Mukden Railway having again been seized by the Mukden Authorities, the railway was deprived of about half its property and earning power.    Daily cash receipts were one sixth of what they should be and insufficient to cover operating expenses.    Serious damage had been done to bridges in the extra-mural section.    The Tientsin Pukow Railway, which if protected and properly administered would be one of the best paying lines in China, was almost completely dominated by military contending parties who were occupying and using it for their own purposes without payment.    The staff had not been paid their salaries and wages for three months or more, and the Administration was in debt to suppliers of material to a sum of approximately eight million dollars. The loan service of the Supplementary Loan issue had been in default sinoe 1st November last.Quiet having been restored in the neighbourhood of Shanghai,  the Shanghai Nanking Railway and the Shanghai Hangchow Ningpo Railway were shewing remarkable powers of recuperation but bofdi were badly in need of additional engines and rolling stock.    Since the return of the British Staff to their headquarters in Canton there had been a marked improvement in traffic earnings on the Canton Kowloon Railway, but only a very limited train service could be run.    This railway&apos;s loan service was also in default.

IMPORTS AND EXPORTS IN 1924 AND 1925.COMPARISON WITH 1909-13.in the chart which we give to-day the course of our Import and Export trade is traced month by month during the last two years, so far as variations in the volume of trade are concerned, the reduction of the monthly declared values to the approximate equivalents at the average values, article by article, of 1934 being made on the basis of the figures which wo V published at quarterly intervals ar^ ^-W&quot;1- L J surveyed in our issue of 21st January. Corresponding figures for the five years 1909-13 have been prepared, the particulars given in the returns issued before the war under the title &quot; Imports and Exports at the Prices of 1900 &quot; having been used in combination with the results of post-war calculations of trade at 1913 values. To ensure a reasonably satisfactory comparison, it has been necessary to make an addition to the pre-war figures as published, so as to obtain an approximate representation of the Imports and Exports of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the quinquenniun 1909-13. The lines shown on the chart give the results of these calculations of the external trade of the United Kingdom, as at present constituted, in that quinquennium, valued on the basis of the declared values revealed in the published figures of the trade of 1924.On previous occasions we have published charts corn-paring, on the basis of 1913 prices, the external trade of the British Isles in recent years and in 1913. The contrasts of the volume of our export trade currently carried on with that of the average of five years pre-cediug the war are somewhat less marked than in the comparisons with the trade of 1913. In view of the fact that, both in volume of trade and in the level of prices, there were signs that 1913 marked a turning point, and that the rapid expansion of the years immediately pre-ceding had already given place, for a time at least, to a period of less active trade, the comparison with 1909-1913 is not less instructive than that with 1913.   At thesame time it must be remembered that, in averaging the monthly figures for five years, some of the sharper con trasts between successive months tend to be smoothed away, and the annual pulsation of trade thrown into greater prominence as a consequence.The steady growth in the volume of export trade during the quinquennium 1909-13 is indicated by tlit general upward trend of the line representing exports in that period, which contrasts rather markedly with the absence of expansion shown by the lines for 1924 and 1925. Our chart of a year ago showed that in 1923 the volume of export trade was very closely similar to that of 1924. The calculations on which the chart is based indicate an average volume of exports about 20 pe cent, greater in 1909-13 than in 1923-25.The lines relating to imports show for 1925 an excep tionally marked reduction in August, pending ths results of the new harvests of the Northern Hemisphere and an exceptional volume of import in December, more or less compensating the August hesitation. The volume of imports in 1909-13 was less than in either 1924 oi 1925. An expansion of about one-sixth appears t( represent the contrast with the latter year, and refleoti in the main the increasing requirements, of a growing population in respect both of food and of the material of industry.The course of our re-export trade is not shown on the chart. The very great influence in that branch of trade of the fluctuations in value of a few commodities, such as rubber and wool, make the calculations underlying the chart less generally significant for re-exports than for the larger import and export trade. If it were ; sible to deduct from the imports of each month the valui of those goods which will not be retained for use or con sumption in the United Kingdom, the variations of re-exports, so grouped, and of retained imports, month bj month, might possess a greater interest. The re-export actually recorded in any month consist, however, partly of goods recently imported and partly of goods imported in the preceding month or earlier. The result is thai such calculations as are possible lose much of their ; nificance. The difference between imports and export as shown on the chart does not, accordingly, represent the balance of our trading month by month.18821.   Wt.250.   2/26.   Wy. &amp; S., Ltd    Gp. S8.
Statement regarding the export trade position made at the meeting of the Advisory Committee to the Department of Overseas Trade held on the 20th January, 1926,i, _ ,,i    a     .............COAL tir. Hargreaves,  (Yorkshire colliery district), said-&quot; that the mining Industry was pretty fully occupied and heattributed this largely to the effect of the recent cold weather and also to the Government&apos;s subvention.   The American labour troubles had also led to a general improvement in trade Good business was being done with Belgium and Sweden, and he said that in those markets our coal exporters had not suffered greatly from German competition.     He referred to the possible position of affairs when the coal subsidy came to an end, and he also touched on the question of the effect of sheltered wages on the unsheltered trades.     He agreed with the Chairman that a fall of price would be very beneficial to the export trade and would lead to large orders being obtained for this country.COT TON Mr , Hoiroyd (Cotton Spinning) was unable to reportmuch general improvement in the cotton trade.     In the spinning section the position had grown worse and it would be necessary as from the 25th January to start two days short time instead of one.     The effect of this decision was that working hours would be down to about 28 hours per week. He was glad to say, however, that during the last two or three weeks there had been a much better demand for cotton cloth and many mills were full for several weeks ahead. This improvement would in turn benefit the spinning section.In answering, a point put by Mr. Dodwell, he emphasised that it was Impossible to fit up better mills than those existing In Lancashire.      He deprecated any statements to the contrary.     It was true that Japanese spindles were running on three shifts and that their lower wages and longer hours of work resulted in Lancashire products being under-sold in the world5 s markets,j r. Vyle referred to the export of textile machinery and the diminution which must necessarily take place in the export of textiles as the result of other countries being able to satisfy their own demands,&amp; ST5BL Mr , Bond speaking of the pig iron,  steel and finished steel industries,  said that considerable change had occurred in the pig iron market.     Prices were higher and, as the result of the strike in Belgium, and. the economic conditions in Germany, the demand was difficult to fill. Apart from this, in the heavy iron and steel trade he could sec- no signs of improvement.     During the last six or eight weeks a dull period had been experienced in the black sheet and galvanised, sheet trade.     There was fortunately no reason to suppose that the demand would not recover and exports were well maintained.      It was a remarkable feature that the total world production of pig iron was no larger today than it was in 1913, although there had been every/reason
ERALInitial,^placedreason to expect that the world con.su.uption would be increased, The United States were responsible for half of the world c onsuinpt ion of st e e 1.The tin plate manufacturers of South 7/ales were seriously perturbed at the reported application of the Broken Kill Proprietary Company to the Australian Tariff Board for a duty of  5 per ton to be imposed on tinplate. The industry proposed to make representations to the Commonwealth Government on the subject and he hoped they could enlist the assistance of the Department  in the presentation of their ca,se.     Hr , Samuel stated that the matter would be given consideration,fiAiia AND fcr . Vyle said that though Birmingham wasiPffiADBS.   not .satisfaction&quot;sfied&apos;&quot;with last year, he thought that the prospects for 1926 were more hopeful.     There was more freedom of purchases from colonial markets, more export business was at present being done and more enquiries were being received, Fir, Vyle also referred to the coal situation and said that the position of to-day was to an extent being over-shadowed by uncertainty.IvlNG. Mr , Good enough, who was unable to be present at themeeting, send the &quot;following statement to the Committee*&quot;We see a good deal of improvement in many directions, notwithstanding the adverse Board of Trade returns in regard to &quot;visible&quot; exports and imports which have just been issued,  and we think that conditions should further improve as the adverse effects of the over-valuation of sterling in the earlier part of the year gradually disappear , Up to the present there seems to be no doubt that, as contracts are usually made for some time ahead,, this over-valuation has had a continuing prejudicial effect, but it is gradually diminishing&quot;The whole outlook., however, at the present time is mainly over-shadowed by the coal problem.      The coal trade appears to be fairly active but, pending the issue of the Report, there is great uncertainty as to what will happen after the termination of the subsidy, and this uncertainty must necessarily prejudice business,&quot;Mre Rogers said that speaking as a banker he was of opinion that markets abroad were full up.     This resulted in a temporary set-back, but he thought that the position would be cleared up in the near future&apos;.      He spoke optimistically of toe prospects of trade with Persia and mentioned that Birmingham &quot;was now minting Persian coins which had. previously been minted in Russia,Mr. Gray Buchanan (iron and steely metals,  India merchant trade. et&quot;fVJ sTated that a rise of 10% in the price of pig iron had followed an advance in Yorkshire coal and coke prices.     But for this advance he thought that orders from Japan and the United States would have been
placed, in this country,, instead of, as had been the case, being diverted to Germany,     As far as the territory in whic; he was mainly interested, which extended from Egypt to Singapore, was concerned, orders were plentiful.    Important orders had been received for steel bars, road rollers, raaohlne tools, and in India an increasing trade was being conducted in copper squares,Mr, Dodwell (China merchant trade) read an extract from an article by&apos; the foreign correspondent to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; (19/1/26) regarding the attitude of China towards Britain,    He said that in his opinion the views correctly expressed the position..     He added that the boycott on British goods in Canton was causing British merchants considerable misgiving and they were only able to place goods on the market by shipping them on foreign steamers or by smuggling them in.     Fortunately in the north, the boycott,was,comparatively speaking, a failure. He stressed the desirability of taking steps to counteract the insidious propaganda campaign conducted by the Bolshevist in China and mentioned that British merchants were finding large sums for that purpose.     They hoped to receive Government financial assistance,     He thought the China merchants had prepared a scheme and promised, if that wore the case, to submit it to the Department,     The Chairman stated that the Foreign Office were watching the position, which was causing the gravest anxiety, very closely.     The adverse effect on trade with China created by the present condition of affairs  was fully realised,Mr, Dodwell then drew attention to the loss of trade sustained by this country in China and pointed out that the share of the piece goods trade held by the United Kingdom had fallen from 63609 per cent, in 1911 to 28,84 per cent, in 1923, though in 1924 it had risen to 32449 per cent, On the other hand, the Japanese who only enjoyed 12,69 per cant, of the trade in 1911 had increased their proportion to 56.69 per cent, in 1.924, the 1923 figures being 60,21 per cent,.     He presented a statement showing the imports of various classes of machinery, piece goods and metals into C hina.Mr_f._Lijid.say stated that the political position in India had. improved &quot;and mentioned the good effect of Lancashire attitude in connection with the abolition of the cotton excise duty.     Referring to the cotton market he said that the fall of raw cotton should have its reflection in the price of cotton goods and the imports into India,   The price of cotton fell by some 15 per c6nt . during April to November, 1925; during which period the imports into India were 983,000^000 yards as against 1,181,000,000 yards for tho corresponding period of the previous year.     The British share of the trade was 84 per cent.     Mr. Lindsay made special reference tc the tendency of British imports being handled by a 1 3.1? P*g J* ilVd aber  ef  smaller firms than was the practice in pre-war days.    He quoted figures substantiating this suggestion.   . He was very definitely of the opinion that this tendency to trade direct with the smaller firms must have a bad effect both on quality and service.In regard to the reports of a shortage in the jute crop, from the enquiries he had made he under stood that the crop would be sufficient for normal requirements and that steps were being taken to ensure that shipments of good quality seed would be made,
