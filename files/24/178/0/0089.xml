P. A. HANKEY.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, February 26, 1926.Enclosure 1.Extract from DRAFT Minutes of the 210th Meeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence, held on February 25, 1926.^ ^ 4t 4fc ^ ^(7.)-KENYA.   PROPOSED CREATION OF A european defence FORCE.(OLD. Paper No. 258-C.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in which he brought to the notice of the Committee of Imperial Defence a Defence Force Bill for Kenya containing clauses which legislated for compulsory service in the Defence Force (OLD. Paper No. 258-C).Mr. AMERY explained that the Defence Force Bill had been accepted by the Legislative Council in Kenya, but that subsequently Mr. Thomas, the Secretary of State for the Colonies under the Labour Government, had refused to give his assent to the Bill. He presumed that Mr. Thomas&apos;s reasons for refusing assent were that he was in principle opposed to compulsory service in any part of the British Empire. He now proposed to give his assent to the Bill, but before authorising the Governor to introduce it into the Legislative Council, he considered it desirable to bring the matter before the Committee of Imperial Defence. His own opinion was that there was no objection to the proposed compulsory service conditions, since he considered that the conditions in Kenya justified such a measure. The white population in Kenya was comparatively small and lived in the midst of a large black population. The white population were inclined to be somewhat hot-headed, and he considered it preferable to place them under a certain measure of discipline by enrolling them in [14248] b
an organised Defence Force than to the sporadic formation of irregular corps in time of emergency. &quot;v &quot; vMe. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN suggested that the question was one which should receive consideration by the Cabinet.Conclusion.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed That the question should be referred to the Cabinet for consideration. ******Enclosure 2.[C.I.D. Paper No. 258-C.]KENYA.PROPOSED CREATION OF A EUROPEAN DEFENCE FORCE.Memorandum      the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I DESIRE to bring to the notice of the Committee of Imperial Defence the position in regard to a proposal for the creation of a European Defence Force in Kenya.In 1919 the Governor of Kenya (then the East African Protectorate) submitted two draft Ordinances providing respectively for the establishment in the Colony of a Defence Force and a Territorial Force. Service in the Defence Force was to be compulsory (with certain exceptions) for Europeans ; the Territorial Force was to be organised on a voluntary basis and to consist of such members of the Defence Force as might volunteer.The Oversea Defence Committee, in their Memorandum 497-M, dated the 11th November, 1920, took the view that the conditions in East Africa, where there were small white populations living in the midst of large native populations, were somewhat different from those generally prevailing, and for this reason they agreed that, although the principle of compulsion had not been generally adopted throughout the British Empire, it was probably only by resorting to it that it would be possible to organise the adult male Europeans in Kenya (and Uganda) into efficient military forces for dealing with any internal disturbances that might arise.Subsequently legislation to provide for the creation of a Defence Force on the lines proposed was introduced in Kenya in August 1921. It was, however, rejected in the Legislative Council, all the unofficial members being opposed to the measure, their opposition being to a great extent on account of the compulsory conditions attaching to it.   The Territorial Force Bill was, however, passed and became law.In January 1924 the Governor on his own initiative reintroduced the Defence Force Bill and it was accepted by the Legislative Council; but it was subsequently not assented to as the Governor was informed that the then Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Thomas) was not prepared to approve a compulsory service Ordinance.At the end of 1924 the Governor reported that the feeling among the British settlers in Kenya was emphatically in favour of the Bill. At the same time attention was called to the fact that the enactment as drafted only provided for a very modified form of compulsion in times of tranquillity and that the existing absence of local defence arrangements might, in the event of a native rising, result in the loss of much life and property in the scattered farm areas before a force could be sent to the districts affected. The Governor took the view that to meet this risk there must be compulsory registration and an obligation to serve.After careful consideration of the matter I telegraphed to the Governor in February 1925 that I agreed in principle with the provisions of the proposed
3530Defence Force Bill, but that I would require to be satisfied as to the proposed use of the Force. The Governor has since reported that the Force would be employed in the event of native unrest for the purpose of localising the disturbance as far as possible and protecting life and property until such time as the situation could be taken in hand by the King&apos;s African Rifles, assisted, if necessary, by the Territorial Force.&quot;When the details of the proposed Bill were recently under the consideration of the Oversea Defence Committee the question was raised as to whether the compulsory clauses contained in the enactment might not be criticised as providing for the arming of Europeans to shoot down the black population; and in consequence it has been suggested to me that, before authorising the Governor of Kenya to reintroduce the Defence Force Bill into the Legislative Council, I might like to bring the matter to the notice of the Committee of Imperial Defence. My own opinion is that there is no reason why, by general agreement, the proposed compulsory service conditions should not be introduced in Kenya.L. S. A.February 5, 1926.[14248]
Enclosure 3.OVERSEA. DEFENCE COMMITTEE.KENYA.Defence Force Ordinance.Remarks by the Oversea Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.THE Colonial Office have referred for the consideration of the Oversea Defence Committee a despatch from the GJ-governor of Kenya, forwarding a copy of a Bill entitled &quot; An Ordinance to provide for the organization of the European inhabitants of the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya for the defence thereof,&quot; together with certain other correspondence between the Governor and the Colonial Office in explanation of this Ordinance.The despatch, together with the Ordinance and the subsequent correspondence, are attached as Appendices to these Remarks.2. Before referring the Ordinance to the Oversea Defence Committee for consideration, the Colonial Office, in a despatch, dated the 12th February, 19i!5 (Appendix III), requested the Governor to furnish them with further information with regard to the following points, namely, the proposed employment of the Defence Force, its training, its relations with the Officer Commanding the Troops, Kenya, and its cost. The Governors replies to these queries are contained in a despatch, dated the 9th April, 1925 (Appendix IV).3.   These replies may be summarised as follows : (a.) Proposed use of the Defence Force.In the event of native unrest or rising, the Defence Force would be employed with a view to localizing unrest as far as possible and to protecting life and property until such a time as the situation could be handled by the King&apos;s African Rifles assisted, if necessary, by the Territorial Force.(b.) Training.Compulsory training is not legislated for, as for some years to come the majority of the members of the Force will, it is considered, have had military service in the Great War. The probable type of service to be undertaken does not call for a high standard of military training, but does require that the men enrolled should be armed and capable of using their weapons; it is also necessary that all details be previously worked out so that, in the event of the employment of the Force, there will be no confusion. Musketry classes, through rifle clubs, are to be encouraged, and, if he considers it necessary, the Governor can order a district unit to fire a course or any untrained member to be trained in the use of the rifle.(c.) The Relation of the Force to the Officer Commanding Troops.The Force, if it takes the field, will be under the command of the Officer Commanding Troops. In normal times he will be the Chairman of the Central Committee, which will regulate the organization of the Defence Force.[.OC.D. Paper No. 676-R.J

Before referring the Ordinance to the Oversea Defence Committee for consideration, the Colonial Office, in a despatch, dated the 12th February, 19^5 (Appendix III), requested the Governor to furnish them with further information with regard to the following points, namely, the proposed employment of the Defence Force, its training, its relations with the Officer Commanding the Troops, Kenya, and its cost.

(d.) Cost.The estimated cost will he approximately  3,000 per annum. The details of the expenditure are given as an Enclosure to Appendix IV.4. The Oversea Defence Committee have no remarks to offer with regard to the Governors observations quoted under sub-paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) above. With regard to (6), the question of training, the Committee note the intention of the Governor not to legislate for compulsory training other than musketry training, but they further note that Section 25 empowers him by Regulations published m the &quot; Gazette &quot; to provide for &quot;(a.) The general government, discipline,  training,  and management of  the Defence Force,* * * *        ;       * * &apos;(c.) The attendance at Drills, Inspections, Classes and Courses of Instruction of members of the Defence Force and the examination of members of the Defence Force as to proficiency in military professional subjects.....&quot;This seems to give the Governor unlimited powers to order whatever training of whatever length he thinks fit, and, moreover, to order members of the Force to go through courses of instruction and to submit themselves for examination in military professional subjects.In addition, Section 21, which relates to inspections and rifle practice, contains no limits to the liabilities of members of the Force in those respects.It may be considered that the powers thus conferred on the Governor are too wide, and the Committee suggest that it would be better to re-word Section 21 so as to give the Governor express power to call out all or parts of the Defence Force for inspection, training, or rifle practice, while at the same time limiting the total amount of time to be devoted to these purposes to a definite number of hours or days per annum.The Governor could then, at his discretion, still refrain from imposing the liability for training for any particular year or years if he considered it to be-unnecessary.The following redraft of Section 21 is suggested : &quot; 21. The Governor may from time to time call out, in the manner provided by Section 17, the Defence Forcfi for inspection, training or rifle practice under their own officers at such time or times and at such place or places within their respective Defence Force Districts as he may direct, provided that the total period of time in any one year for which any member of the Defence Force may be required to appear for inspection, training or rifle practice shall not exceed [here state the maximum number of days or hours of training which it is considered desirable to impose^ exclusive of any period during which he has been called out for service under Section 19 of this Ordinance.&quot;5. Turning now to a more detailed criticism of the Ordinance itself, the Committee are of the opinion, after consultation with the Legal Advisers of the War Office, to whom the Ordinance was referred for criticism, that the actual drafting is capable of amendment in certain particulars, and that it might have been desirable to have followed, to the extent to which they seek to attain the same object, the lines of the Military Service Statutes of those Dominions and Colonies which have already adopted compulsory service. Such enactments are in force in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and in certain of the Colonies. It is probable, however, that this Ordinance as it stands will attain its purpose generally, and will be held capable of adequate enforcement by the courts of the Colony. Amy defects which appear can he removed by subsequent amendment.6. The Committee note that service in the Defence Force is to be compulsory, with certain exceptions, for all male British subjects of European origin or descent between the ages of sixteen and sixty years (both inclusive), and that &quot; other residents of similar age and origin or descent may be enrolled.&quot;   (See Section 3.)Although the principle of compulsion has not been generally adopted, the Committee recognise that, in order to organize the adult male Europeans in Kenya into efficient military forces for dealing with any disturbances that may arise, it may be necessary to resort to this method, particularly in view of the fact that the conditions in East Africa, where there is a small white population living in the midst of a large native population, are somewhat different from those generally prevailing; and pas experience has shown how difficult it is to raise and maintain from a small scattered white population an efficient military force on a voluntary basis.
They consider, however, that provision should be made whereby the Governor could refuse to enrol a resident of European origin or descent, other than a British subject, should such a course appear advisable, and suggest accordingly that a full stop should be inserted after the word &quot;capacity &quot; in Section 3, and that&quot;the last two lines of that Section should be amended to read as follows : &quot; Provided further that a male person other than a British subject may, subject to the same conditions as to age and origin or descent, enrol himself with the permission of the Governor.&quot;7. It is suggested that there is need for a series of definitions, e.g., of such expressions as (a) &quot; British subject of European origin or descent&quot; (Section 3, lines 2 and 3); (b) &quot; enrol himself &quot; (Section 3, line 7).As regards (a), it is suggested that the phrase should be amended to read &quot; British subject, both of whose parents are of European origin or descent.&quot; Such wording would exclude undesirable persons of mixed parentage.As regards (6), it would appear desirable to include specific instructions as to the procedure to be adopted, unless it is intended to make such provision by Regulations under Section 25.8.   The following detailed criticisms are put forward for consideration: Section 3, lines 3 and 4.&quot; between the ages of 16 and 60 years (both inclusive).&quot;It is suggested that this definition would be made clearer if the form of words used in the Military Service Act, 1916, Section I, were employed, i.e., &quot; who has attained the age of sixteen years and has not attained the age of sixty-one years.&quot;It is desirable to describe the ages in words and not in figures wherever any reference to them occurs, both in the body of the Ordinance and also in the marginal headings.In addition provision does not appear to have been made in this Section for the enrolment of those persons who attain the age of sixteen years at any date subsequent to that on which the Ordinance shall come into force. It is suggested, therefore, that the following words should be added after the words &quot; so resident as aforesaid &quot; in line 6 of the section, &quot; or within one month of attaining the age of sixteen years,&quot; &amp;c.Section 3, lines 4 and 5.&quot; Colony and Protectorate &quot; should apparently read &quot; Colony or Protectorate.&quot;Section 5, line 6.&quot; between the ages of 16 and 60 years (both inclusive).&quot; Vide remarks on the definition in Section 3, lines 3 and 4.Section 6.It is questionable whether a compulsory oath should be required of persons &quot; deemed to be enrolled&quot; whether they wish it or not. A similar power was given in the Australian Defence Act of 1903, but there is nothing of the kind in British National Service Acts.Section 18, line 3.It is suggested that the words &quot; wilfully fail or neglect&quot; are likely to cause legal difficulties, and that in consequence the word &quot; wilfully&quot; should be omitted.Section 18, line 10.The meaning of the expression &quot; or to both&quot; is not clear in relation to the expression &quot; or in default of payment.&quot;Section 19.The second sentence should be amended to read as follows : &quot;Provided always that in the case of sudden and imminent danger in any district, when it is not possible to obtain the authority of the Governor without undue delay, the Senior Commissioner or Officer discharging the duties of Senior Commissioner may for the defence of the district or any part thereof, &amp;c, &amp;c.
Or alternatively the Clause should stand in its present form and the following-paragraph inserted at the end : &quot;Provided further that no action beyond what is necessary for defence or protection as aforesaid shall be taken without the authority of the Governor or, if he cannot be communicated with without undue delay, of a Senior Commissioner or Officer acting as Senior Commissioner, who shall forthwith report to the Governor as hereinbefore laid down.&quot;It is suggested that either of the&apos;above amendments would prevent a junior officer from calling out the Defence Force in his district except for the protection of life and property and not as an offensive or punitive measure.Section 22. ^It is suggested that the precedents of other Colonial and Dominion Statutes might well be adopted, such as Section 55 of the Defence Act (Australia), 1903, and that Sub-section (1) of this Section be amended to read as follows : &quot; Members of the Defence Force shall, when they are on service or called out for the same or when called out by the Governor under Section 21 hereof, be subject to the provisions of the Army Act, 44 and 45 Victoria, Chapter 58, and all Acts amending or substituted for the same, save so far as they are inconsistent with this Ordinance, but so that the regulations under Section 25 hereof may prescribe that any provisions of those Acts shall not apply to the Defence Force.Provided that (a.) The words &apos; the Defence Force &apos; may be read therein for the words &apos; Regular Forces,&apos; the words &apos; Member of the Defence Force &apos; for the words &apos; Officer or Soldier,&apos; as the case may be, and the word &apos; Governor &apos; for the words &apos; His Majesty &apos; and &apos; Secretary of State &apos; ;(6.) No sentence of a court martial upon the trial of a member of the Defence Force shall be carried into execution unless confirmed by the Governor or such officer as he may appoint on his behalf.&quot;Section 24, Line 7.The meaning of the words &quot; without prejudice, &amp;c.&quot; is not clear. This sentence appears to require redrafting.Section 24, Line 11.The expression &quot;or to both&quot; is not clear in relation to the expression &quot;and in default of payment.&quot;(Signed) L. A.

APPENDIX II.Governor, Kenya, to Secretary of State tor the Colonies. (No. 1440.) JSir, . November 5, 1924.WITH reference to Kenya telegram No. 252 of the 11th August, I have the honour to submit a copy of the official report&quot; of the debate in Legislative Council on the Defence Force, and to recommend strongly that further consideration may be given to this Bill before His Majesty is advised to exercise his power of disallowance.2. The feeling amongst the British Colonists in Kenya is emphatically in favour of the Bill as forwarded to you. This feeling was brought out when the last Officer Commanding Troops held over thirty meetings in the settled areas, and received unanimous support in his outline of the Bill.3. The Bill only allows for a very modified form of compulsion in times of tranquillity. The principal measures contemplated are that the names of Europeans capable of bearing arms should be registered and that local Defence schemes should be brought into being and passed by a Central Committee.4. The absence of such local defence arrangements means that in case of native risings much loss of life and property may ensue in the scattered farm areas before a force can be sent to the area affected. In order to obviate this danger, there must be compulsory registration and obligation to serve, or else the defence arrangements will lack the completeness which is essential to their success.5. I have said that there is a wide-spread feeling in the country in favour of some form of compulsion, and the provisions of the draft Bill embody that principle in the most moderate form.It was clear from the speeches of the Elected Members that they believed that no Bill from which the principle of compulsion -is entirely eliminated would be likely to win the active sympathy and support of the community.6. I shall be grateful if you would convey your decision by telegraph in order that the financial provision in the Estimates may be adjusted as necessary before the third reading takes place towards the end of December.I have, &amp;c. (Signed) E. T. COEYNDON.APPENDIX III.Secretary of State for the Colonies to Governor, Kenya.(CO. 57093/24.)Sir, February 12, 1925.IN confirmation of my telegram of the 4th February, I have the honour to inform you that, in view of what is stated in Sir E. Coryndon&apos;s despatch No. 1440 of the 5th November, I am willing to agree in principle to the Defence Force Ordinance of 1924, a copy of which was forwarded in Sir E. Coryndon&apos;s despatch No. 400 of the 7th April last.2. There are, however, certain aspects of the matter upon which I first require to be satisfied namely, the proposed employment of the Defence Force, its training, its relations with the O.C. Troops, Kenya, and its cost, and I asked in my telegram of the 4th February that I might be furnished with a full report on these points.I am, &amp;c. (Signed) L. S. AMERY.APPENDIX IV.Governor, Kenya, to Secretary of State for the Colonies.yNo. 409.)Sir, April 9, 1925.WITH reference to your telegram of the 4th February and your despatch No. 148 of the 12th February on the subject of the Defence Force Ordinance, 1924, I observe with satisfaction that you are willing to agree in principle to the provisions of this Ordinance.2. As regards the points on which further information is desired, I have the honour to inform you that in the event of native unrest or rising this Force would be employed with a view^ to localizing unrest as far as possible and to protecting life and property until such time as the situation could be handled by the King&apos;s African Rifles, assisted, if necessary, by the Territorial Force.3. Training. Compulsory training is not legislated for, as for some years to come tlie majority of the members of the Force will, it is considered, have had military service in the Great War. The probable type of service to be undertaken does not call for a high standard of military training, but does require that the men enrolled should be armed and capable of using their weapons; it is also necessary that all details be previously worked out, so that, in the event of the employment of the Force, there will be no confusion.* Not reproduced.
Musketry classes, through Rifle Clubs,&apos;are to be encouraged, and if he considers it necessary the Governor can order a district unit to fire a course or any untrained member to be trained in the use ofthe rifle.4. The relation of the Force to the Officer Commanding Troops. The Force, if it takes the field, will be under the command of the Officer Commanding Troops. In normal times lie will be the Chairman of the Central Committee, which will regulate the organisation of the Defence Force.5. An estimate of the cost of the Force, submitted by the Officer Commanding Troops is annexed, from which it will be seen that the expenditure involved will be approximately  3,000 per annum. -6. I trust that in the light of this report you will advise His Majesty not to exercise his power of disallowance.I have, &amp;c.(Signed) E.
