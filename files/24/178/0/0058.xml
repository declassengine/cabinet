[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, iPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1926, SECRET. *CP. 57 (26).CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.Indians in South Africa,The following telegraphic correspondence between the Government of India and the Governor-General of South Africa is circulated for information with reference to CP. 22 (26) :-Telegram from Viceroy, Department of Education, Health and Lands, to Secretary ofState for India, dated 7th February 1926.Following telegram has been received to-day from the Governor-General of South Africa; &quot; Your telegram dated 10th January, 0008 Overseas/6&apos; My Ministers desire me to thank Your Excellency very cordially for your courtesy in communicating to thehrso fully and promptly the interim and provisional conclusions and recommendations of the deputation sent to South Africa to enquire into the position of the Indian population in the Union.&quot; 2. With regard to Your Excellency&apos;s suggestion that it might still be possible for the Union Government to agree to the holding of a round-table conference, my Ministers&apos; fully appreciate the desire and motives of the Government of India in pressing for this particular method of dealing with the problem. They wish me to state, however, that they have repeatedly given their most earnest and anxious consideration to the proposal, but that for reasons already stated, and in spite of their desire to meet the wishes of Your Excellences Government, if possible, they cannot see their way to alter the decision to which they have previously come.&quot; With regard to the observations in the deputation&apos;^ Report on the general situation in South Africa, and more particularly on the probable effect of the various provisions of the proposed legislation, my Ministers wish to point out that any conclusions to which the deputation have come must necessarily and do admittedly rest on very fragmentary evidence gathered within a very limited period. They agree, therefore, in general conclusion that this evidence must be supplemented before final and reasoned judgment shall be possible. They cannot, however, agree that such further evidence must be collected by means of a fresh enquiry on the part of a commission appointed for the purpose, as this course seems to be unnecessary in view of similar and very exhaustive enquiries by the Asiatic Enquiry Commission held only a few years ago, and of information which can be made, available from official sources. Besides, a fresh enquiry as suggested will of necessity cause further delay of legislation which is urgent and is already long overdue, while on the other hand Parliamentary Select Committee, to which it is proposed to refer the Bill, will provide most suitable means and opportunities to supplement, as far as such may be required, any evidence which is already in hand.&quot; -I-. While, on the one hand, my Ministers must regret their inability to accede to the request of the Government of India for a round-table conference, or a fresh enquiry, they, on the other hand, fully realise the anxieties of that Government to place as fully as possible the case of the Indian community in South Africa, before the Government of the Union. It is for this reason that they previously adumbrated the possibilities of the evidence before a Parliamentary Select Committee by the deputation of the Government of India now in the country after Bill shall have passed the second reading. Although reference to a Select Committee after the second reading will imply the maintenance of the general principles of the Bill, it will, at the same time, offer a very wide scope for evidence and will not even exclude evidence on such a fundamental question, in which the Government of India is primarily concerned, as to whether the proposed segregation shall be voluntary or compulsory. To this suggestion which they have offered, my Ministers have thus far received no reply, and they are consequently in doubt as to the existence of any difficulty on the* Quoted in second enclosure to CP. 22 (26).1002      100   2.26
part of the Government of India in accepting same. If such difficulty, however exists on the ground of too great a restriction of evidence which deputation might desire to bring forward, my Ministers would agree to propose reference of the Bill to a Select Committee before the second reading, thus widening the scope for evidence so as to include principles of the Bill. They wish it, however, to be understood that such a proposal on their part will be subject to the Government of India intimatino-thei r willingness to avail themselves of this opportunity, specially offered, to place evidence before Select Committee through their deputation now in South Africa, and, further, that it will be subject to Select Committee being required to report to Parliament within such limited period as will enable Parliament to deal finally daring the present session with legislation proposed.&quot;5. My Ministers have gladly acceded to the request of Your Excellency&apos;s Government that the deputation, who are now in Cape Town, shall be received by one of the members of the Union Government. Intimation to this effect was sent to the head of the deputation immediately after the receipt of Your Excellences last communication, and proposed interview has already taken place.&quot;The matter is receiving our urgent consideration.Telegram from Viceroy, Department of Education, Health and. Lands, to Secretary ofState for India, dated 9th February 1926.Our telegram dated 7th February. We have sent the following reply to the Governor-General of South Africa : &quot; We are in receipt of Your Excellency&apos;s telegram dated the 5th February, and would be grateful if you would be so good as to convey to Your Excellency&apos;s Ministers our warm appreciation of the courtesy and consideration they have extended to us and to our deputation.&quot; 2. While we cannot conceal from Your Excellency our deep disappointment that Your Excellency&apos;s Ministers have found it impossible to agree to either of the alternative methods put forward by us as best calculated to lead to a satisfactory solution of this problem, we recognise that our proposals have been given the fullest and most anxious consideration. &quot;We further understand that the offer now made to us involves a departure from the normal parliamentary practice and procedure, and we see in this another proof of the desire of Your Excellency&apos;s Ministers to find a solution of this difficult question. My Government are, in the circumstances, prepared to accept, subject to the conditions stipulated in Your Exoeliency&apos;s telegram and to our observations in succeeding paragraph, the offer made by Your Excellences Ministers of an enquiry by a Parliamentary Select Committee before the second reading of the Bill. We note with satisfaction that the terms of reference to Committee will be sufficiently wide to include the consideration of the principles of the Bill, and we assume that it is the intention of Your Excellency&apos;s Ministers &quot;also to allow representatives of Indian opinion in.South Africa an opportunity of presenting their case to $lie ; Committee, which we feel, sure Your Excellency&apos;s Ministers will agree could not fail materially to assist the Committee in its task.&quot; 3. As the. Union Government are aware, our objections to the Bill are fundamental, and are against the principles on which the Bill is. based. We propose, therefore, to instruct our deputation to present the case before Select Committee in respect of general principles, although it necessarily follows from our arguments that we object also to details of the Bill. We realise that Your Excellency&apos;s Ministers are anxious to avoid -unnecessary delay, but we trust, in view of the very grave consequences for Indians which the proposed legislation must involve, the fullest possible opportunity, compatible with the limitations laid clown in Your Excellency&apos;s telegram, will be afforded for presentment of the Indian case.&quot; 4. We are anxious that offer made by Your Excellency&apos;s Ministers and our reply thereto should be published here with least possible delay, and should be glad to know urgently by telegram when it is proposed to make these public in South Africa to enable us to arrange for publication here.&quot; -.r,^    &apos;  .
