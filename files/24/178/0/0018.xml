Ministry of Home Affairs, Northern Ireland, Belfast, 20th January,  1926.Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Home Affairs for Northern. Ireland to&apos; refer to your letter of the 19th instant f  addressed to Sir J:-mes craig, notifying the decision of the Imperial Government in regard to the release of the Northern Ireland prisoners, and to state that as His Grace the Governor is at present absent from BELFAST,  it will not be possible to obtain his authority for the release of these prisoners until his return on Saturday the 23rd instant0      Immediate steps will then be taken to arrange for the release of the prisoners from the various gaols In which they are at present serving their sentences0I have also to state that the Northern Government does not,  for various reasons,   think it desirable &apos;.hat these men should be permitted to take up residence in Northern Ireland,  except in localities where their presence Is not likely to constitute a danger to the public peace.It will be appreciated that with a Police Force which has just suffered so serious a depletion in numbers It will not be practicable to provide for such close supervision as formerly,  and In these circumstances the presence of the convicts who are now being relased might In certain parts of Northern Ireland prove a source of grave danger^It has been decided,  therefore,  that exclusion orders under Regulation 25  (a) of the Civil Authorities  (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland), 1922,  should be made in the case of all these prisoners, prohibiting them from residing in or entering any portion of Northern Ireland save such portion as may be fixed (to be set out in the Order) having regard to the circumstances of the cases it is proposed that an Officer of the R.U.Constabulary should notify each of the prisoners when being released of the terms of the Order,  and the Minister assumes that the Governors of the Gaol3 concerned will afford facilities to enable this to be doneaI am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) \.\A, MAG-ILL,ASSISTANT SECRETARYaRt0HoneSir John Anderson,K,C,Bo; Under Secretary of State for Home Affairs, Home Office.

&apos; illTELEGRAM FnOH THE PRIME MII^ISYBu TO SIR JAMES ORAIG. (Despatched January  1st ,    1926 ),I have just learnt of the proposal of the Ministry of Home Affairs to issue exclusion orders In respect &quot;of the prisoners to be released under the Supplementary Agreement *     I must strongly urge you to reconsider this proposals     The clemency of the Crown which has been exercised on behalf of these men ought not in my opinion to be qualified by what is In effect a further penalty in respect of their original offencesc     Those of the men whose homes are in the Free State can be dealt with if In fact they&apos; return to Northern Ireland and make mischief while an regards those whose homes are in Northern Ireland, and the majority of whom would have been due for release In the ordinary course this year,  the action might justly be deemed oppressive,      I am most anxious that this country and Ireland as a whole should reap the full benefit of the better feeling which I trust has been engendered by the recent Agreement and I am convinced that the action contemplated will be widely regarded as Inconsistent both -with the professions contained in that Agreement and with the exercise of Royal clemency *      I do not forget, the responsibilities which rest upon your Government with their depleted resources but make these urgent representations because I feel that dangers are involved in the action proposed which outweigh any risks that would attend the complete liberation of the small number of men concerned 0i&quot; 2 -
