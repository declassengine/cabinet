CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1926.confidential .fitTelegrams exchanged between His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Constantinople and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.[E 676/62/65] , (1.)Sir ti. Lindsay to Sir Austen Chamberlain.Constantinople, January 28, 1926.I HAVE to-day returned from Angora, where I had two interviews with Minister for Foreign Affairs and one with Prime Minister.With former, conversations were friendly and, on the whole, quite businesslike. There was in his language an absence, though unusual and incomplete, of quibbles, insincerities and false arguments. We soon disposed of preliminary question of conditions or reservations formulated in note of 9th January from Turkish Ambassador in London. I made it unmistakably clear that views of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to Geneva proceedings were radically different from those of Turkey in the note, and on this Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed his readiness to continue conversations, each side, as he said, maintaining its own opinion.I said that I had come to ascertain what adjustments were possible to facilitate matters for Turkish Government, and to do so I was anxious to find what were reasons of State underlying their wide territorial demands. He said first point was question of security as affected by Kurdish situation. With Persian Kurds he said that no trouble need be anticipated, but with passing of any considerable number of Kurds under a third Power interminable difficulty was to be anticipated. Pie gave an odd turn to this question by maintaining, I think insincerely, that southern Kurds would always be desirous of joining themselves to their kinsmen in Turkey, and would therefore be impelled to organise constant raids across northern frontier and keep up a state of perpetual insecurity. He said that Turkey did not wish to incorporate Arabs in the State and that Turkish Government had no hostility to Irak and no desire to reconquer lost territories. He referred more than once sympathetically to &quot;Arab ethnic entity.&quot; Turkey had no fear of any Arab aggressiveness against herself. It is particularly to be noticed that he stated no arguments in favour of inclusion of Mosul town in Turkey.Another point made was what he called &apos;&apos; floating frontier.5&apos; At a previous stage of dealings between the two countries, he said, frontier claimed or held by Great Britain during last six years had been steadily pushed further north till now we have a de facto line more unfavourable than that of rejected Treaty of Sevres. To convince Turkey of permanence of any arrangement now made, frontier must go a good way back to the south.I asked him to develop idea he had in mind at Geneva, when he had suggested a guarantee pact. He replied that, presupposing settlement of a frontier, he had contemplated a three-Power pact, including Persia, and guarantee of joint frontiers between them; then later on he had hoped for a similar pact for Syrian frontier bringing in French. This, he said, would have necessitated conclusion of similar arrangements with Russians, and so attainment of her final aim, which was neutrali-sation of Turkey.He made no mention of any idea of demilitarisation, though I gave him every opportunity. I also ascertained that commercial adjustments had no attraction for him. He was not in the least interested in a scheme for transit of Turkish goods through Irak to Basra, which has been mentioned in a newspaper.With Prime Minister I had a good deal more difficulty. He told me quite frankly that he wanted to leave Mosul negotiations solely to Minister for Foreign Affairs3289   [14175]
and did not wish to discuss it with me, and I found it hard to make him talk till quite at the end, when he relaxed somewhat. He said at one moment that possession of Mosul City was the crux of the whole question, but perhaps the remark may be dis-counted somewhat, as it was in reply to a challenge which I put. He referred to Kurdish question, as he did last November, but rather subordinated it in importance to territorial and frontier question. Latter, he said, was-only aggravated by existence of former. He referred to Minister for Foreign Affairs&apos; suggestion about &quot;floating frontier,&quot; saying that, as a result of it, everyone in Eastern Turkey and Western Persia now believed that English intended to push to Van and that resulting disquietude was intolerable. The frontier to be fixed could not be acceptable unless it was such that tribes would be convinced by its nature that it was final and that no further expansion northwards would take place.My general impression is that Turkish Government have now made up their mind to give up claim to Mosul town, but that they are determined to obtain a cession of territory further east and to have as much as they can possibly get. I obtained no indication as to what line would satisfy them. I do not think that they have any idea of other alleviations in their mind at present.General atmosphere at Angora is calm and there is no longer any talk of war. The tone with regard to my visit, both at the capital and in Constantinople press, is one of indifference and scepticism over outcome of negotiations. This, I think, is an inspired mot oVordre.(Repeated to Bagdad.)[E 687/62/65] (2.)Sir R. Lindsay to Sir Austen Chamberlain.Constantinople, January 29, 1926.[REFERENCE omitted.]Neither of Ministers mentioned internal prestige of Government as a factor impelling them to demand concessions from His Majesty&apos;s Government, but it was stated very explicitly to me by Yunus Nadi, a scurrilous Deputy-journalist, who is well in the presidential circle. He said British pressure over Mosul question was constituting a peril to the republican regime. I think this is true. The hat orders have caused wide dissatisfaction to lower classes. New taxation proposals are likely to make it extend to upper classes, while new civil code, which is to be voted en bloc in a few days by Assembly and put into force at once, affecting as it does whole status of the family, and of women in particular, is giving serious misgivings even to Presidents friends. Thus, though&apos;Government is strong, it is also menaced at its base. If, as I believe is the case, it is to the interest of His Majesty&apos;s Government that present secular and republican regime should continue in Turkey, then this matter of prestige is an argument in favour of finding some solution for Mosul question which will give Turkish Government something to be proud of.[E 688/62/65] (3.)Sir 1&apos;. Lindsay to Sir Austen Chamberlain.Constantinople, January 29, 1926.MY immediately preceding telegram.I had intended to return to Angora in about a week and continue discussions with Turkish Government until you were ready for any further step, but I fear this idea will not work. Both Turkish Ministers were restive under cross-examination and showed impatience to get to business. If, therefore, I revisit the capital as I had meant to, I feel sure I shall elicit no further information as to Turkish views, and I might do more harm than good. If there is any specific point on which you require further enlightenment or have any message of any sort for Angora, I could either go there or communicate through Turkish delegate here, but at present I am in a quandary as to how to proceed and should be most grateful for any guidance you can give me within the next three or four days.
[E! 688/62/65] (4.)Sir Austen Chamberlain to Sir B. Lindsay (Constantinople).p. Foreign Office, February 2, 1926.YOUR telegram of 29th January : Angora negotiations.I consider it would be inadvisable for you to go back to Angora at this moment.The entire question is being considered here as sympathetically as possible. I fear, however, that some time must necessarily elapse before a definite reply can he sent.
