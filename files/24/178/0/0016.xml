Copy No.CP. 16 (26).CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT  ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 124.   December 1925.THE following statement gives a summary of the recently published return of unemployment in the various industries. The larger quarterly report will be issued as soon as the collection of the necessary returns for the period up to the end of December has been completed : (A.) Numbers of Persons on the Registers of Employment Exchanges inGreat Britain.	1923.	1924.	1925.				 	Dec. 17.	Dec. 22.	Nov. 30.	Dec. 7.	Dec. 14.	Dec. 21.	Decrease since Nov. 30.Men .. Boys .. Women Girls ..	884,338 32,688 227,456 30,004	897,451 30,281 215,850 25,635	937,434 29,131 172,582 26,128	939,241 28,073 169,059 24,884	912,369 26,835 164,662 23,580	896,386 25,865 157,953 22,196	41,048 3,266 14,629 8,932Total..	1,174,486	1,169,227	1,165,275	1,161,257	1,127,446	1,102,400	62,875Note : (1.) The above figures represent the number of persons registered at Local Offices as applicants for employment.   In the main they relate to persons who had claims to benefit current and were not at work on the dates given. (2.) No&apos; statistics for the week ended December 28 are available.Percentage of unemployment (Great Britain) in the insured industries at the end of December 1923     .... .... .... ....   10*51924     .... .... .... 10-61925     .... ............   101With the exception of a slight rise in the men&apos;s register at the 7th December, the figures of men, women, boys and girls on the registers of Employment Exchanges decreased progressively throughout the three weeks for which statistics are available, the net decrease amounting to 62,875. The continued fall in unemployment is again accounted for largely by the continued improvement in coal-mining and the absorption of workers in the Christmas trade.Compared with the corresponding dates in 1923 and 1924, the position at the 21st December, 1925, was somewhat better, the decrease being 66,827 over a year ago and 72,086 over two years ago.

(B.) Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 21st December, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was I0&apos;5, as compared with 11&quot;0 at the 23rd November, with 10&apos;7 at the 22nd December, 1924, and with 10-6 at the 21st December, 1923.The figures at the 21st December in respect of industries showing appreciable variations in unemployment during the month, together with the increase or decrease as compared with the previous month and with a year ago, are given in the table below: Industry.

The improvement shown in most of the other industries during the month was largely seasonal.The Building Trade showed the largest decline. In the Iron and Steel Industry a slight retrograde movement was evident, and a further fall occurred in Pottery and Earthenware.Other industries not mentioned in the above table which showed considerable improvement at the 21st December, 1925, as compared with a year ago, were Tinplate Manufacture, Lead, Tin and Copper-mining and Brass and Allied Metal Wares Manufacture.Industries which are still in a worse position than a year ago are Coal-mining, Marine Engineering, Shipbuilding and Ship-repairing, the Linen Trade, Stone-quarrying and mining, and Building and Public Works Contracting.
(C.) Latest Figures.The latest figures of unemployment published are those for the 11th January, which give the total numbers on the registers as 1,221,403. The increase over the position on the 21st December amounts to 119,003,*but the figures are less than those of a year ago by 58,451. This large increase in unemployment is normal at this period of the year. While the distribution of the increase over the various industries is not yet definitely known, a geographical analysis shows that it has occurred in nearly all parts of the country.A.
