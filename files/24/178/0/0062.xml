S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.------ -......-SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES. -APPLICATION BY THE LINEN INDUSTRY, Memorandum by the President   of the Board of Trade.An application has been made under the Safeguarding of Industries Procedure by the Irish and Sootch Linen Industry for a duty of 10$a on imported linen yarns and on Importedlinen piece goods and other linen manufactures.The industry is a large one,  employing some 86,000 insured persons;  some five-sixths of whom are in Northern Ireland, where the production of linen goods is one of the few staple industries. Sir James Craig has made strong representations to me and to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in favour of the application. Unemployment is severe,,  the percentage of totally unemployed being 33.6 in December 19S5.Since the war the industry has been depressed largely on aocount of the failure of supplies of flax from Russia and neighbouring countries and the consequent scarcity of raw materials and high prices. In part,  also?demand has decreased owing to change in fashions, and the adoption of substitutes.Exact information regarding production is obtainable only for 1906; it was then 158 million lbs. of yarn and 356 million linear yards of cloth (the latter is estimated to he equivalent to 462 million square yards). The Applicants have made estimates&quot;of production in recent years, the estimate for 1925 being 70.5 million lbs. of yarn and 143 million square yards of cloth.The industry has always depended largely on the export tradeExports of cloth represented 60% of home production in 1906 and82% of home production in 1925.The Imports of cloth In 1906 are estimated to have been4.3% of the home production in that year and in 19S5 5.6% of-1-CRET. 7&quot;61  (26)
home production, hut on account of the falling-off in the demand of the home market the increase in the ratio of imports to home consumption has been very much greater.   In 1906 imports were   10% of home consumption, and in 1925 they were 24$.   The extent of the home market is calculated by the Applicants from their estimate of home production, by the deduction of exports and the addition of imports.   This calculation, therefore, depends wholly on the Applicants estimate of home production, but It is really the only ground on which it could be contended that a prima facie case has been made out.Imports of cloth were valued in 1913 at  1,195,000, and in 1924 (excluding those from the Irish Free State) at  664,000. In the corresponding years exports were valued at  8,248,000 (Great Britain and Ireland) and  13,320,000 (Great Britain and Northern Ireland) respectively.Imports of yarn similarly are smaller than in 1906;   but while in 1906 they were 13$ of home production,  in 1925 they were 25.7% of home production.The imports of yarn come from Belgium, France and Ozecho-Slovakia, and of cloth mainly from Belgium;    hours are longer and wages lower in these countries than here.There is a considerable importation of cloth from the Irish Free State, the cloth produced there being largely marketed through Belfast,     The Applicants state that the Irish Free State and the Government of Northern Ireland could make an arrangement as to this,  though the nature of the arrangement is not disclosed.   If a special concession such as a preference amounting to the whole duty were made to the Irish Free State in connection with linen,  there would no doubt be a demand for a similar preference by other Dominions in regard to other duties in which they were interested.     Also, unless a similar duty was concurrently imposed by the Irish Free State,  there wouid be danger of foreign goods being imported into the Free State and subsequently reaching the United Kingdom in the same
or other forms as Free State goods.Departmental papers giving more detailed particulars of the industry are attached.If this were simply an English application I    should, on the whole, reject it, hut in view of the representations which Sir James Craig has made,  it raises an important question of policy and I therefore submit it for the consideration of my colleagues.(Intld.)    P.C-L.Board of Trade,12th February,  1926.
SAFEGUARDING OP INDUSTRIES? LINEN INDUSTRY.Revised Application. (Previous application D.C.3.27). Note by Mr. Ashley for the Departmental Committee.The revised application adds little that is new besides production figures to the former case rejected on the ground that imports were not abnormal.The applicants have now furnished production figures for the years 1906 and 1922-5, and the following comparisons can thus be made with respect to linen manufactures.All Linen Manufactures.

The applicants comparisons of Import figures on page 6 and in Appendix I are vitiated by the fact that they Include Imports from the Irish Free State and therefore show a sharp and fictitious rise in 1923-4-5.

Some difficulty would probably arise with regard to the relation of the Irish Free State to any duty whioh might be imposed, but in this connection, both sides have indicated their willingness to come to some arrangement.The applicants ask for a duty of 10 per cent, on yarns, both the imports and exports of which are now some 55 per cent, of their quantity in 1913.The following table gives a comparison of imports and production of yarn prior to and since the war.Yarn (by quantities)*j I 1	1925 tage	as percen-of 1906.	1 Percentage increase 1922 to 1925.I Production... j Imports...... L......,v............._______.....	43.6$ 87$		-7.8$ 207$ (192  to 1924 only)It is noteworthy that output of Yarn is less this year than in 1922,  though from 1922-4 production had shown a rise.Evidence of currency depreciation and low wage rates remains as in the previous case..   Particulars of unemployment are given on pages 8 and 9: for Northern Ireland, the figure for December 1925, was 35.2 per oent. unemployed, though until then, the figure had been falling, being 24.56$ in 1922 and reaching 10.36$ in 1924. In Scotland,  employment is stated to have fallen from 23,711 persons employed in 1914 to 13,566 employed in April of last year. The unemployment figure for both Great Britain and Northern Ireland in   December 1925, was 55.3$ unemployed out of a total employment of 86,620.Protests against the application have reached the department from members of the industry both in Sootland and in Ireland, and detailed statements will probably be forwarded from these sections: their protest probably relates, however, more particularly to the application in respect of yarn than to that in respect of linen manufactures.P.A.2/2/26.
SAFEG HARD IMG OF INDUSTRIES. LIKEN YARN AMD PIECE-GOODS.Note by the Departmental Committee.This is an application by(a) The Flax Spinners&apos; Asscn..,  Ireland,(b) The Irish P owe r Loom Manuf act&apos;arers &apos; As sen.,(c) The Irish Linen Merchants As3on.,(d) The Scottish Flax Spinners1 and manufacturers&apos; Association.in respect of Linen Yarns and Piece-Goods,(1) There is no doubt of the substantial Importance of the industry: the numbers normally engaged In Northern Ireland in the processes from scutching to weaving, &quot;being stated at 66,000,  (besides 15,000 to 20,000 in subsequent operations)  and in Scotland in April,1925, the number employed was approximately 13,600.(2) Unemployment is severe.     Among the Linen Employees in Northern Ireland the percentage of totally unemployed was in 1922 24.6%&apos;, in 1923 15.5%; in 1924 10.4%j and in 1925 35.2% (In each case for the month of December).     Separate figures for Scotland are not available, but the number   of operatives was in June,1914, 23,711, and in April,1925, 13,566.(3) The main fact which emerges cn consideration of the applicants case is that there has been a very heavy fall In production as compax^ed with the pre-war period, and that the decline In consumption has been much more marked in the home than in the foreign market. Further, whilst the three years 1922 to 1924 showed a steady upward trend of production, there was a bad reaction in 1925.     Applicants estimates, which In respect of production the Departmental Committee are
unable to check, are as follows.-(a)    YARNS.1--	 ---Pr oduction.	Net Imports.	Imports as Percentage of Production.

The effect on employment of a restriction of imports., on their        [I present scale, could only be very small in the case of piece-   I goods etc.,  though it might be appreciable in the case of yarnsjl The proposal to impose a duty on yarns raises, however, a question which is referred to in a later paragraph of this note.(5) A striking feature of the applicants case is the shrinkage of the home market.    They estimate the United Kingdom 1 consumption (home production - exports and net imports) of
linen piece-goods etc., at about 203 million sq. yards in 1906, at 45 million in 1921, at about 52 million in 1923 and 1924, and at only 33 million in 1925*   The foreign proportion of the home consumption in 1906 was 10$j in 1921 it was 5.4?&apos; and has since steadily risen to 24$ in 1925.(6) The main cause of the depression in the Linen industry of the United Kingdom appears to be the general shortage of supplies of flax, and the shrinkage of the demand for linen goods as a result of the consequent high prices and the substitution to a large extent of cotton for linen.    The home market has shown a much greater shrinkage-&quot;-than the foreign market, probably because the United States, our principal export market, is in a much better position than ourselves, to pay hi^a prices.(7) The chief competition is from Belgium and Prance, where wages are substantially lower and whose imports into this country ar,e aided by heavily depreciated currencies.(8) The Informal Committee are of opinion that taking the application as it stands a case within the terms of the White Paper is formally made out.   There is no important user-producer industry which might be adversely affected by a duty on linen piece-goods except possibly the fishing trade in respect of sail-cloth.   But as regards yarns there is   certain to be some opposition: a group of manu-facturing firms in Northern Ireland (small In relation to the total number) and a similar group in Scotland (relatively more important) have indicated that they dissociate themselves from,  and oppose, the application -and it is understood that their objection is in fact to a duty on yarn,(9) It must be remembered that it would be extremely difficult to administer any system of drawbacks in respect of imported yarns used in the manufacture of goods forexport, and in respect of imported linen piece-goods used-B-
in the preparation of made-up goods for export;    and that the export trade is far more important at present than the home trade.(10) Finally, it is clear that even if the applicants should be successful,, before a Committee the beneficial effect on employment of a restriction of the imports of pieoe-goods could only be small,  though it might not be insignifioant:    the imposition of a duty on yarns might appreciably affect employment in the spinning seotion but the reaction on the weaving side and the export trade might offset this considerably,   though applicants are apparently not afraid of such a result,(11) Another point to notioe is that imports from the Irish Free State are large.     They are omitted from the figures above for 1923-25,
