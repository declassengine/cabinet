THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S QOVERMEIOT.CAB INET, ^Home Affairs Committee, Copy No,       vLocal Authorities (Emergency Provisions) Bill. Covering Note by the Minister of Health.Notioe of this Bill has already been given.     It is an essential Bill and it is desirable that it should be paefretf hy the 31st March of this year as the provisions which it proposes to continue will expire on that date.It provides, as did the Local Authorities (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1924, for the extension for a further 2 years of -1. the operation of Section 1 of the Local Authorities (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1923, whereby the cost of indoor relief in the metropolis is charged on the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund at the rate: of l/3d per head per day, and the cost of outdoor relief is.-, charged on the Fund at a maximum rate of 9d per head per day.2. The operation of Section 2 of the Emergency Provisions Act. of 1923, which enables local authorities to borrow for the purpose of providing temporarily for their current expenses, and otherwise extends their borrowing powers during the continuance of abnormal employment.The proposed extension of the borrowing powers of local authorities is necessary and uncontroversial, but there will be opposition in respect of the proposed extension of the charges on the Metropolitan   Common Poor Fund.I have received deputations representing boththe Unions who contribute to and the Unions who receive- 1 -SECRET. CP.74(26).
from the Common. Poor Fund.     The former class have urged strongly that there should be a reduction in the rate of charge Upon the Fund and that in all circumstances a Union should be required to pay at least 25 per cent of any expenditure of a class which is chargeable on the Fund.     ThB Receiving Unions have urged that the rate of charge in the case of out-door relief should be increased from 9d to l/-.The Paying Unions base their request upon principles of financial soundness and upon the ill results   i&apos;n the shape of the increase of out-door relief which have, as they claims followed from the present arrangements.     The Receiving Unions point to an increase In the cost of relief per head and to the increase of cost which they allege results from the refusal of unemployment benefit to large numbers of persons.I have great sympathy with the views of the Paying Unions, but, as my colleagues are aware, it is proposed next year to introduce a   Bill which will re-organise the administration of the poor law in the Metropolis and I cannot but feel that what these   Unions suggest really amounts to little more than an irritant and can have no substantial curative effect upon the position as it exists in London.In these circumstances I think it right to continue the present provisions.     A draft of the Bill is attached.(Intld.) N.C.Ministry of Health.February 18th, 1926. *-
