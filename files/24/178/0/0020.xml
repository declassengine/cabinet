NTJAl.fclSjOCME!?T IS THE FROPFBTY OF HIS ;BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 standard OF OFFICERS1 LIBSSING IE THE NAVY. Note by the First Lord of the Aflmiralty.kt a Meeting of the Cabinet oh August 7th, 1925, following a discussion on the pay ox the Fighting Services, it was decided that the Admiralty should enquire into and report to the Cabinet on the question of messing in the Havy, with a view to effecting a reduction In its cost,   (Cabinet 44(25),  Conclusion 9(e)),I accordingly circulate the attached Memorandum which has been prepared by the Admiralty on this subject.EC RET.v. 19(26).CABINET.ii * 0    13&quot;mA amir a It y, S.W.1.,26th January,  1926.
The standard of Messing of Naval Officers, in theirrespective Messes,  is more or less uniform,  as might he expected from the conditions imposed &quot;by a Naval ^Service;and it may be taken that the cost of messing in a Ward Room -the majority of Naval Officers mess in the Ward Room - is4,/- a head daily, which includes such &quot;extras&quot; e.s afternoontea,  coffee at lunch and dessert.    These &quot;extras&quot; are not, ofcourse,, taken by every Officer, and the cost  is therefore often less than 4/-.The cost of messing of Junior Officers in the Gun Room Mess is about 2/9d. and in the Warrant Officers1 Mess about S/6d a day:    &quot;extras&quot;, such as are provided, have not been included in these figures.These results compare favourably with the other Services. In the Army the cost of messing varies with the individual Regiments according to the table kept, but taking- an average Line Regiment as a suitable standard for comparison with a Ward Room Mess in the navy,, it is gathered from enquiries which have been made, that the cost per head, including &quot;extras&quot; corresponding to those allowed for in the Navy figure, works out at about 4/&apos;- a day.    In the Royal Air lores,   where the standard is more uniform than, in the Army, the cost is also understood to approximate to 4/- a head.The figures quoted include in each case the Ration Allowances paid by the Services, which are the same for Officers as for Men.The board of Admiralty are satisfied that the standard of Officers&quot; Messing in the Navy is very moderate,and they do not consider that any modification in the existing arrangements is called for.
