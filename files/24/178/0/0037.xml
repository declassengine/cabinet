This Bill was approved by the Cabinet and introduced last session.    It is urgently pressed for by all the interests concerned.    It is I helieve wholly non-contentious;    and I ask that it may be introduced in the House of Lords at once.The provisions of the Bill are explained in my memorandum CP, 361 (25), which was before the Cabinet when they approved the Bill last year.(2). It was explained in that Memorandum that the Bill corresponded, so far as regards Clauses 1, 3 and 4, with an earlier Measuring Instruments Bill which was Introduced in the House of Commons in 1922 and was introduced in,  and passed, the House of Lords in the Session of 1924, hut on neither occasion succeeded in making further progress, although there were no signs of opposition to the measure,(3).    It was further explained in my memorandum that Clause 2 of the Bill was new, and was required in order to authorise fees to he imposed for work done by the Board of Trade and by Inspectors of Weights and Measures in respect of which, in the opinion of the Law Officers, It is not competent to make a charge under the present wording of the law.(Intld).
