i mmCONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,4 this document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.fCRET.Ik 68(86)CABINET. RE-ELECTION OF MINISTERS BILL. gQMemorandum by the Home Secretary.This Bill will reach Committee at an early date and accordingly it is desirable that a decision should be reached without delay as to the attitude which the Government will take on the amendment proposed by Sir John Simon that the Bill shall not operate during the lifetime of the present Parliament.It is to be noticed that Sir John Simon advanced no arguments in favour of this proposal.      He admitted without qualification that the principle of the Bill was right, but at    the end of his speech suggested that &quot;it is in a high degree invidious and in the circumstances unfair for a change of this sort to be brought  into operation very soon after a General Election when an immense majority site on the Government side,  etc.&quot;.It seems unreasonable that if the principle of the Bill is admitted to be right,  its operation should be postponed.      The position is simply this. - The House by a large majority has admitted that the requirement of re-election is an unnecessary inconvenience, but as the Government which will for the next few years be inconvenienced happens to be. a Conservative Government,  therefore the Opposition parties would like to see the removal of the inconvenience delayed.I myself was doubtful about the principle of the Bill, but once the principle has been admitted,  1 think that our
W.J.H.ISth February,  1926,supporters will not like postponing its operation.One must remember that it is not the Cabinet so much as the rising Members of the Party who will suffer from the hardships of bye-elections.May I therefore have my colleagues&apos;  decision as to the line I am to adopt in Committee?
