no^UMEflT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOvFlBNMENT.CABINS T. Hemo.ran.dvgn by the Minister of Labour. INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OP HOURS OF WORK.100 (26 ) .1. On the 22nd January the Cabinet after considering my memorandum CP * 17 (22), authorised me to arrange for invita-tions to be sent to the Governments of Belgium, Prance, Germany and Italy to attend a Conferenoe in London to consider the question of the International regulation of hours of work.2. The invitations, whioh were issued for the 15th March, havo all been accepted, but I ought to inform my colleagues that the French Government in their answer expressed the opinion that the confer on.ce should devote itself exclusively to exchanging views on the various difficulties presented by tho Washington Convention and to reconciling as far as possible such divergencies as were brought to light with the object of facilitating simultaneous retifioation of the oon-vention by the five Powers ooricerned.     They asked to be assured of my concurrence in this view of the task of the Oonferenco and 1 replied that the Conference had been oalled with the object of soeing whether any solution could be reached of the difficulties that had hitherto prevented ratification.3. Since the invitations were issued, I havo discussed vax-ious points in the Convention with the General Council of the Trade Union Congress, who have at my request set up a small informal committee to be available to me for consul ta-tion on current industrial practioe and the of feet upon it of tho provisions of trie Convention.     I am also to discuss *       these aspects of the problem further with the National Con-federation of Employers&apos; Organisations in the course of this weok. -i.
Ministry of Labour. 8th March,  1925 .4* In my former memorandum I outlined trie main points upon which agreement seemed to me essential, if real progress was to be made by the Conference.     It seems to me vital that any such agreement should in tho first place impose no restrictive conditions that would In practice affect adversely the competitive power of British industry, and that it should secondly do something - however tentative - towards establish-ing a basis for raising the standard of working conditions as regards hours of labour among our competitors abroad. In particular I regard it as essential to secure assont to the British view on what are to be considered as hour of work, on the method of calculating hours for purposes of overtime, and on the requirement that an extra rate of not less than 25p is to bo paid for overtime *5. If in the course of or as a result of this Conference I find it practicable to reach an agreement on these lines, together with satisfactory assurances that the other States concerned will adopt tho agreement and ensure enforcement, the Govemm.ent should, I think., be prepared to implement itj I propose to work to this end accordingly.(Intld.)
