[This. Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government ]SECRET. Copy No,     3QCP. 89. (26).CABINET.IRAK POLICY COMMITTEE.REPORT.AT a meeting of the Cabinet held on the 17th February, 1926 (Cabinet-6 (26), Conclusion 2), the Cabinet, at the request of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, agreed-......    :That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows :- The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (in the Chair), The Lord Privy Seal, The Secretary of State for the Colonies, The Secretary of State for War, - The Secretary of State for Air,   &apos; The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,The Under-Secretary of State, India Office (nominated by the Secretary of State for India),should meet to advise the Cabinet upon the instructions to be given to the British Ambassador in Constantinople for his guidance in negotiations with Turkey.2. The Committee met on the 24th February, and, at the request of the Foreign Secretary, Lord Salisbury took the Chair. At this meeting they had the advantage of hearing the views of Sir Henry Dobbs, High Commissioner for Irak, on those questions in which Irak itself is intimately concerned.3. The Committee commenced its enquiries with an exhaustive examination of various proposals for securing a general settlement with Turkey under the following headings: (a.) A treaty whereby Turkey&apos;s neighbours would guarantee her integrity, and would undertake to come to her assistance if attacked.(b.) A Pact whereby Turkey, of the one part, and all or some of her neighbours, of the other part, recognised her frontiers as finah and undertook not to attack one another.(e.) A guarantee of the Turco-Irak frontier only, coupled with an undertaking to submit to arbitration any disputes arising in respect of that frontier. id.) Readjustments of the Brussels line laid down by the League Council on the16th December, 1925. (e.) The extension of the Baghdad Railway to Mosul from its present Easternterminus at Nisibin. (/.) Reassurances to the Turks regarding our policy towards the Kurds inIrak.(g.f A Turco-Irak Extradition Treaty. 01.) Commercial agreements.(i.)  An invitation to Turkey to join the League of Nations.[14266] .    ;-;Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1.926.
The views of the Committee in regard to these proposals, and the considerations by which the Committee were guided, are summarised in the following paragraphs: A Treaty of Guarantee.4. It is not practical politics for Great Britain to guarantee the frontiers of Turkey against aggression, and to associate with herself in this action France, Italy, Persia, Greece, Bulgaria and possibly Russia. The difficulties of inducing the other Powers-and especially Italy and Russia to come in are likely to be insuperable; and public opinion at home, already uneasy at the extension of the Mandate in Irak, would be seriously alarmed.at this additional liability.A Pact of Non-Aggression.5. The less ambitious proposal for a pact of non-aggression between Great Britain and Turkey, on the lines of the recent Russo-Turkish Treaty, is open to two objections. Firstly, it requires a stringent saving clause to safeguard our obligations under Article 16 of the Covenant, and any mention of the League of Nations, at any rate, short of according Turkey the full rights enjoyed by Members of the League (see paragraph 12 below) is most distasteful to Turkey in view of the Council&apos;s recent award. Secondly, it would be unworkable without a system of compulsory arbitration, which is contrary to the policy hitherto followed by His Majesty&apos;s Government at Geneva and Locarno.Guarantee of the Turco-Irak Frontier.6. A strictly limited guarantee of this nature has several advantages. It should allay Turkey&apos;s fears, amounting to an obsession, that our demands for the extension of Irak northwards will never &quot;cease, and thus tend to give her that sense of security which she needs, at any rate as regards one of her frontiers.Readjustments of the Brussels Line.7.- (a.) There, is no objection on strategical or other grounds to ceding to Turkey the two salients at the Eastern end of the Brussels line, provided there is no question of the transfer of any considerable population.(b.) It would, however, be a mistake, and possibly vitiate the whole negotiations, to demand in return fpr these salients a quid pro quo, such as a strip of territory in the Tiari country North of the Brussels line.(c.) Any cession to Turkey of territory to the South of the two salients, extending as far as Rowanduz, would be dangerous not only on strategical, but also on general grounds,for the following reasons : (i.) Rowanduz is the key to the whole position in South-Eastern Kurdistan; it was taken by British forces three years ago, after an operation: of great difficulty.(ii.) The abandonment of this district would cause grave discontent among the Iraki Kurds; it would alienate from us a population which is now especially friendly, and have a very unsettling effect throughout Irak, (iii.) The recently appointed Kurdish chief over all this district is a man who has been sentenced to death in Turkey, and We clearly could not abandon him to the Turks.(iv.) A withdrawal from Rowanduz would not appease the Turks, and would seriously weaken our strategical position. An early reduction of the Imperial units in Irak would thus be rendered impossible, and the expenditure on those units would be prolonged.Extension of the Baghdad Railway to Mosul.8. With regard to the proposal for the extension of the Baghdad Railway from Nisibin, this might, to some extent, adversely affect the strategic problem of Irak. Nevertheless, other things being equal, the strategic disadvantages are outweighed by the political and commercial advantages which Would ensue from a favourable outcome of our conversations with Turkey.
It. has riot yet been&apos; definitely ascertained whether the Turks would appreciate the value of this proposal, but if they should show any inclination in tbat direction it might be possible to arrange for the completion of the line. This could be effected directly by British capital in the Iraki section of it, and by a loan to Turkey for the Turkish section. Possibly, further financial &quot; gilding &quot; for the benefit of the Turks might be practicable. For the moment, however, the most that can be said to Sir Ronald Lindsay is that, if he should find the Turkish Government attracted by the prospect of the completion of the Baghdad Railway, the question would receive consideration.Reassurances regarding British Policy towards the Kurds.9. It is clear from Sir R. Lindsay5s reports that it will be exceedingly difficult to convince the Turks that the liberal measures adopted in Irak, e.g., as regards the use of the Kurdish language in the schools and courts, do not conceal an ulterior design to foster Kurdish separatism and political autonomy. An effort should, however, be made to reassure Turkey on the point that our whole efforts are concen-trated on making the Kurdish districts in Irak a part of Irak.Extradition Treaty.10. Turkey has frequently complained that criminals and malefactors, after committing crimes on the Turkish side of the frontier, are able to obtain immunity from punishment by crossing into Irak territory. An agreement for the extradition of fugitive offenders between Irak and Turkey might, therefore, appeal to the Turks; and His Majesty5s Government could use their good offices to bring this about.Commercial.11. With regard to the possibility of offering to the Turks a participation in the oil concession in the hands of the Turkish Petroleum Company, the difficulties are very great.  The shares are at present allotted to four groups, viz. : (1.) The British (Anglo-Persian) Oil Company. (2.) The Anglo-Dutch Shell Company. (3.) The French Group. (4.) The American Group.This arrangement was only reached after protracted negotiations of considerable difficulty, arid it would be most undesirable to disturb it. In the event, however, of the American Group refusing to take up their &quot;shares which is unlikely the possibility of providing something for Turkey might be reconsidered. As, however, the shares belong to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, they could hardly be expected to hand them over to Turkey without compensation, which we should have to provide.The alternative would be to offer the Turks a share of the oil royalties;Under the present arrangements the Irak Government is to get 4s. per tori of oil produced. The objections to asking Irak to forego a portion of what may turn out to be her principal source of income are overwhelmingly strong, both on grounds of sentiment and of practical equity. This alternative, therefore, offers no opportunity for a concession to Turkey.A n Invitation to J din the League Of Nations.12. Sir R. Lindsay 5s reports show that the main object of Turkey is to obtain a sense of real security Within her Own borders. This cannot be done by a guarantee to assist Turkey if attacked (see paragraph 4 above); but it could be pointed out to her that, in addition to the guarantee which we should be ready to give regarding the Turco-Irak frontier only, she could obtain a great measure of security on her. other frontiers if she came into the League. Her present distrust of the League could be met by the same arguments as were used in the case of Germany, namely, that the more Turkey is dissatisfied with the League, the greater the reason for her to seize the opportunity of obtaining a voice in the League,5s proceeedings. But the suggestion might be approached upon much wider grounds. The Turkish Govern-ment is anxious to qualify in all respects as an up-to-date Western Power.   It could
therefore be represented to them with great force that membership of the League of Nations is the hall-mark of Western civilisation, and would be entirely in keeping with Angora&apos;s policy of making the new Turkish State thoroughly Western.Conclusions.13. . The general conclusions of the Committee are as follows : .It would be useless to send Sir R. Lindsay back to Angora, to resume negotiations with the Turks, unless he is in possession of all the proposals which we can entertain to be used with the Turks as and when he thinks best. His instructions should indicate firstly, the proposals which His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to countenance, viz., a treaty guaranteeing the integrity of Turkey and undertaking to assist her if attacked; a pact of non-aggression in respect of all Turkey&apos;s frontiers, with or without a system of compulsory arbitration; and a readjustment of the Brussels line which would hand over Rowanduz town and district to Turkey. Secondly, they should define the limits of what His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to offer to the Turks, viz. : (1.) An Anglo-Turkish treaty whereby Great Britain and Turkey mutually engage to respect as final the Turco-Irak frontier, and to submit to arbitration any disputes which arise in connection with that frontier.(2.) A readjustment of the Brussels line, not extending beyond the two salients at its eastern end.(3.) Assurances to the effect that every precaution will be taken, as regards administrative measures in the Kurdish parts of Irak, to prevent those districts becoming a menace to Turkey&apos;s administration of her own Kurdish provinces.(4.) A suggestion to Turkey that the best way in which she can secure a completesense of security on all her frontiers is to join the League of Nations, . . as all progressive European States have done, and thus obtain thebenefits Avhich all Member States enjoy under the Covenant. (5.) Consideration of the extension of the Baghdad Railway from Nisibin toMosul if the Turkish Government is-attracted by the prospect.   (But seeparagraph 8 above.) (6.) The good offices of His Majesty&apos;s Government to obtain for Turkey some form of participation in the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s concession.As explained in paragraph 11 above the difficulties in this direction areat present almost insuperable. (7.) It is also perhaps worth consideration whether we could probably offer our good offices to secure the conclusion of a Turco-Irak extradition treaty.It is recognised that none of these proposals, taken by itself, will offer much attraction to the Turks, and that even taken together, they fall considerably short of the more ambitious scheme (a guarantee of Turkish integrity, plus a substantial modification of the Brussels line), which Sir R. Lindsay seems to regard as the minimum required to satisfy Angora. At the same time as a whole they give Turkey greater benefits than the terms of the recent Russo-Turkish Treaty, which was hailed as a triumph at Angora; and they are probably not less attractive for Turkey than the terms to which she has just agreed with alacritjr in the Turco-Syrian agreement negotiated by M. de Jouvenel.14. It is important that Sir R. Lindsay should receive his instructions early in March, as the season is approaching in April when there will be greater danger of incidents and unrest on the Brussels line owing to the melting of the snow on the mountains. The terms contained in this Report might, if the Cabinet agree, be transmitted to him by telegraph so that in case he desired to make any representation in respect of them there might be time to give them consideration.Signed on behalf of the Committee,SALISBURY, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, March 1, 1926.1 I
