[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.MOST SECEET. Copy No. BiCP. 75 (26).CABINET.CIVIL SERVICE COST OF LIVING BONUS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.IN 1920 a revised scheme for the payment of cost of living bonus on Civil Service remuneration was brought into force. So far as.the scheme applied to officers with wages or salaries not exceeding  500 a year, the scheme represented a bargain with the staff side. To officers above that limit the scheme was applied by executive decision. The general effect of the scheme was to provide an addition, equivalent to the increase in the cost of living, to wages or salary not exceeding 35s. a week. On wages or salary above that amount the percentage addition payable by way of bonus becomes less and less as the rate of salary increases.In the following year the Government decided that the bonus payable on salaries in excess of  500 a year should be made subject to a special cut (additional to any downward variation corresponding to a fall in the cost of living index figure), and that no bonus at all should be paid on salaries of  2,000 a year or over, or so as to increase a rate of salary to more than  2,000 a year. The effect of this change, which was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the House of Commons in the course of discussion on the Treasury Vote, may be seen from thefollowing typical examples : Bonus which would nowbe payable under Bonus actuallySalary.                                original 1920 scheme. payable.                                             750 a year............         248 2111,000 a year............         313 2191,500 a year...........         443 1992,000 a year............         573 NilRepeated appeals have been made for the abolition of what has come to be known as the &quot; super-cut &quot; on salaries in excess of  500 a year. In reply to a deputa-tion of staff side representatives which came to see me on the subject last March. I explained the difficulties which made it impossible at that time to abolish the super-cut, adding that I was prepared to leave the matter open, and would be fully prepared at a later date to consider in the light of existing circumstances any further representations the staff associations concerned might desire to make. In reply to further representations made to me at the end of October, I felt obliged to say that the situation in respect of the super-cut was not materially - different from what it had been last March, and I asked the staff side to postpone their request for the time being.The staff side have now decided in favour of an appeal to arbitration. My colleagues are no doubt aware that, in pursuance of an undertaking made in May 1923 by the present Prime Minister, a system of compulsory arbitration is now established in the Civil Service. The system embraces all classes of Civil Servants on rates of basic salary not exceeding  700 a year, or on scales of salary beginning at less and rising to a maximum of more than that amount. Whatever the award of the Arbitration Court may be, the Government is under obligation to accept it, subject only to the overriding authority of Parliament. The broad [ll2-j:i]
effect of the arrangement is to hand over the decision on questions of pay for the vast majority of the Service to a body responsible to no one but itself.It might easily happen that if the question of the super-cut were taken to arbitration, the Court would give an award in favour of the claimants. After full consideration, and having regard particularly to the circumstances in which the present arrangement was brought into force, I have come to the conclusion that it would be expedient to bring the matter again before the House of Commons. In that event I should propose to inform the House that whatever might be possible later on, it would not be right to abolish the super-cut under existing conditions. If the House of Commons were to accept this view, that would be the last word. The Government would be neither obliged nor entitled thereafter to allow the matter to be submitted to arbitration.I appreciate the difficulties of the course now suggested. The amount of money involved in the claim is about  200,000 a year a large sum no doubt, but inconsiderable in comparison with the enormous sum of  6,000,000 a year involved in the claims of the Union of Post Office Workers on which, I understand, -arbitration is now proposed. The particular consideration on which I should rely in this case for anticipating arbitration by a resolution of the House of Commons is the fact that the original decision to impose the super-cut was taken in view of strong representations from all sides of the House, and that the change was brought into effect after it had been expressly submitted to the judgment of the House.W. S. C.Treasury Chambers,February 18, 1926.
