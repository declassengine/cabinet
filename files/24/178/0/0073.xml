(THIS DOCUMENT IS TILS PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY13 government cp, 78(35) .CABIN.....E^note by the Secretary for Scotland.The Scottish Union of Allotment Holders have for some time been pressing for further facilities for the development of allotments, and I recently received a deputation from them with regard to the possibility of legislation on the lines of the English Allotments Act of last yoar.    In discussion it appeared that, as the allotment movement had not reached the samo stags of development in Scotland as in England,, the Union would probably be satisfied meantime with a provision similar to that in the English Act empowering a local authority to rate within a limit of a penny in the pound *I said that if arrangements could be made for the introduction of a short Bill by a private member,  I would see what could be fiono to secure facilities for its passage though I could prive no undertaking that facilities woiild be given,A one-clause Bill, drafted in my Department has now been introduced by Commander Fanshawe, and li?. down for Second Reading on Friday,  19th instant.    It is supported by members of all parties.    I understand that a unanimous resolution of approval has been passed by the Scottish Union of Allotment Holders, and I am not aware of any serious objection likely to be taken to it, though some members may be disposed  to raise the question, of financial aid  from State funds towards the provision or equipment of allotments,I propose,  if my colleagues agree, to announce at Second Reading that the Government approve the Bill and will do what is possible to grant facilities for its passage in the event of its passing generally non-contentious,JOHN GILMOUR.Copy No.Scottish Office,16th February, 1926.
