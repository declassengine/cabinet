THE BRITISH FILM INDUSTRY. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I am anxious that the Cabinet should authorise me to make an early announcement of the Governments policy -with regard to the British film industry.    Since the middle of la year, I have been in consultation with the three sections of the Industry - the exhibitors, the renters, and the producers - so far as It is possible to consult such loosely organised^and incoherent bodies, and with representatives of a large number of organisations outside the industry, Including the London County   Council, the Federation of British Industries, the National Union of Teachers, the British Empire League, the Society of Authors, the Stage Guild and others $ and the time has come when I feel I can., formulate my proposals and when I feel a Government pronouncement Imperative.To attempt a full history of my dlsoussions, would be long and not very intelligible.   But I propose to summarise the position as I see it as the result of my investigatixms^I can hardly emphasize too strongly the Importance of establishing a British film industry.    In Great Britain and throughout the Empire, nearly every film shown represents. American Heas, set out in an American atmosphere (and in American language). The accessories are American houses, American motor oars, American manufactures, and so forth, I have no wish to attack orCONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. ^7PT&quot;W (26) \2bCABINET.
to malign the American industry, hut cinematograph audiences everywhere are made up of the most impressionable sections of the community, and it seems to me of the utmost importance that they should see at least some proportion of British films - of importance for our prestige, for our trade, and - I am assured - for our morals.   I am therefore convinced that a British film industry would he a national asset.   But I am anxious not to underrate the difficulties, and not to undertake ambitious measures which might overweight an infant Industry.I am also anxious not to confuse the issue by bringing in considerations of moral or artistic censorship.   British films can only succeed if film audiences, composed largely of young and &quot;low-brow&quot; people, will pay to see them.American domination is due to the following factors, among others(1) The Americans have a vast - and growing -home market.    They have some 22,000 cinema theatres in the United States of America, as compared with our two to three thousand.(2) Reputable people have therefore been induced to sink a very large capital in the industry..(3) They have thus attracted the best technicians and the best &quot;stars&quot;, and can produce films almost without regard to cost.(4) In their technical methods and research they have progressed during the war and after it far beyond our producers.(5) The British exhibitor who wants a big well-advertised American film Is often only allowed to get it if he contracts to take v&amp;th it a number of other films, many of whicih he has not even seen.    This is the system known ag &quot;tjlock-booking&quot;, and &quot;blind-booking&quot;.   As many as 52 films may be sold In one block.-2-
(6) American producers and renters can&apos;afford to advertise a film so thoroughly that an exhibitor is almost driven to acquire it.(7) When a good film is produced in this country, so many exhibitors have &quot;block-booked&quot; for months ahead that the producer cannot place it and must stand out of this money for months.To deal with this situation, I have been pressed to take immediate and drastic action and force a quota of British films on all exhibitors.    But to do that would antagonise many of the exhibitors.    They have a genuine and natural fear lest they might be compelled to show poor pictures, pictures which would not draw audiences. If that fear were realised,  it might kill the movement for British films in tho   same way that the voluntary &quot;British film week&quot; of 1923, by giving a chance to the worst films, did so much harm.Representatives of the industry itself originally recommended a strong line.    A &quot;Joint Ti&quot;ado Committee&quot;, containing representatives of all three sections produced a report recommending the introduction of a &quot;quota&quot; system, involving legislation to compel the renting and showing of a fixod and growing proportion of British films;    the abolition of &quot;block-booking&quot;,  again by legislation; and the establishment of a properly equipped British film studio for the production of films.    These proposals ware referred to their constituents.    The exhibitors, on a referendum, rejected the quota by a small majority in a 5Gf* poll - the majority being mere than accounted for by the votes of two of the largest exhibitors who oast a vote for eaoh &quot;house&quot; they controlled.    They approved action
against &quot;block-booking&quot;, and, in principle,  the establishment of a studio.    The producers and renters naturally favour a quota, and the renters have now declared that legislation to prevent &quot;block-booking? is useless without a quota.   But, generally speaking, the result of the discussions is to show that, so far as there is any consensus of opinion in this peculiar industry, it supports the suppression of &quot;block-booking&quot; and the establishment of a studio.While these various organisations were still passing resolutions, Lord Ashfield (who is Chairman of Provincial Cinematograph Theatres, Ltd.,  the Company in which Lord Beaverbrook is interested), after consultation with me, wrote the letter which appeared in the Press on January 22nd last. It gave the first indication that his Company was prepared to co-operate in assisting the British industry; it pointed out   that British films had failed because they were not good enough, and that the British market was not in itself large enough to give a proper return on the expenses of producing a big film.    He went on to suggest that exhibitors should agree to give a preference to suitable British films, disputes between producers and exhibitors being referred to an impartial tribunal, and that exhibitors should agree not to &quot;block-book&quot;.I understand that Lord Ashfield has since expressed considerable interest in the project for establishing a modern studio in this country, which seems to me one of the essential factors.     There is at present no large up-to-date studio, suitably situated and equipped. sWhen the Germans decided to establish a film industry,  the first step they took was to erect a proper studio.    Something approaching 90% of modern films are taken (or &quot;shot&quot;) indoors; and a studio with proper apparatus and facilities,  in which space could be hired and technical assistance obtained by a producer, without his having
cO sink capital in the erection of a small studio for himself, would be of enormous advantage to our producers.At the same time that I received evidence of Lord Ashfield&apos;s desire to assist, I received encouraging evidence of America&apos;s growing anxiety as to the movement, and desire to help oo that the movement should not become anti-American. I have discussed the question with representatives of the largest financial interest in the industry, and of the largest producing company, and I have reason to believe that if we show a determination to establish the industry here, they will co-operator.    If we do nothing, they are not likely to go out of their way to stimulate the British industry.In these rather confused circumstances, one thing seems to me clear - that public interest in the question, and the interest now shown by the trade, demand a statement of policy from the Government.    If we do not seize the opportunity,  the movement will die away, and the industry will perish.My conclusions are that the protective measure of a compulsory quota would be, at present, a mistake, for the following reasons:-(1) We should not have the general goodwill of theexhibitors; and we ought not to compel them to do whatthey may be prepared to do voluntarily.(2) Public opinion is still growing, and if theexhibitors are allowed to try voluntary methods, andfail, we shall be in a far stronger position to enforce the compulsory system.(3) An immediate compulsory quota wouldaicouragethe inefficient or unscrupulous producers (who are numerous) to raise a little money in the old way and produce bad films to force upon the exhibitors - whichmight damn the whole scheme.
(4) Parliamentary time would not admit of a    4 fi 7 contentious measure.Yet I ^consider It necessary to keep the exhibitors to their various promises, and to make them define those promises as closely as possible.    I therefore suggest - and Lord Ashfield has promised to do what he can to bring the exhibitors into line, if we aot in this way - that I should be authorised to make an immediate pronouncement on the following lines;-(l) That we recognise the national importance Of British Films.-(2) That we are ready to take the exhibitors at their word and will leave them to make a genuine voluntary effort to take as from a given date in the future an agreed proportion of British films.    They should agree with the producers to eet up a trade body to settle disputes and to make a return to me, say quarterly, of the proportion * f British films shown.(3) That if the quota is not realised, or nearly so, within an experimental period of say one year, from the given date, we will enforce it by legislation.(4) That we are prepared to legislate against block-booking if the exhibitors represent to us that legislation is necessary.    The general lines of the legislation would be that after a given date in the future(a) A contract to show a film made before the film has been &quot;trade-shown&quot; should be unenforceable at law.(b) A contract to take a film which was not to be shown within six months should be unenforceable.(5) That we should give our blessing to the idea of a national studio, provided a sound scheme with proper financial backing is put forward (as I hope the Brighton scheme will be);  and a guarantee under the Trade Facilities Act will be possible for such a scheme;if the Committee approve.k of Trade, (intld.)
