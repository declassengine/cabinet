[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ]Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1926.SECRET. Copy;-No.   $0CP. 15 (26).CABINET.RETENTION OF ADDITIONAL  BRITISH  BATTALION IN  IRAQ.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. As my colleagues are aware, in addition to the 8 Air Force squadrons which are the primary instrument of defence in Iraq, there has for some years past been a small contingent of Imperial ground troops. In particular, for the last two years this garrison has included 4 Imperial infantry battalions, 1 British and 3 Indian.2. In October last, owing to the delay in obtaining the League&apos;s ruling on the frontier question, and the uncertain Turkish attitude, the Committee of Imperial Defence decided (at the suggestion of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff) that I should have authority to arrange with the other Departments concerned that any of the battalions which, during the coming trooping season would normally be relieved, should be retained in Iraq in addition to the relieving battalions.3. In accordance with this decision, it was agreed with the War Office that the number of Imperial battalions in Iraq should be raised temporarily from 4 to 5 by retaining a British battalion (the 2nd Battalion Bedford and Hertfordshire Regiment) which in the normal course would, on relief by a replacement battalion, have left the country.4. When the strength of the Iraq Garrison was again under discussion by the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet at the beginning of December, this action was brought to the notice of my colleagues and they endorsed the further retention of this battalion for an unspecified period.5. An immediate decision is now required as to whether in the light of the developments of the last few weeks this additional battalion is to be retained in Iraq any longer. In the absence of such a decision the whole War Office trooping programme is held up.6. The Turkish attitude is still obscure, but, all things considered, I am of the opinion that we might justifiably accept the element of risk involved in this battalion&apos;s withdrawal. It must, however, be recognised that this reduction of the garrison to normal increases to a corresponding extent the probability of our having to ask for reinforcements from India in the hypothetical event of Turkish aggression in the spring.The General Staff have been consulted by the Air Staff on the question and have expressed their concurrence.7. As, however, the decision to raise the strength of the Imperial garrison temporarily from 4 to 5 battalions by the overlap of this British battalion was approved by the Cabinet as a whole, I think it right that my colleagues should be asked to endorse a decision to withdraw it.S. H.Air Ministry, January 14, 1926.[14076]
