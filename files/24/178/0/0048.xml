DOCTMEJTSiT IS; THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMNJC MAJESTY&apos;S CfOVERNMENI!C R E T,Copy Inq.C A B I N E. 47 (26),.TJjpMPLOYiqMT INSURANCE (NORTHERN IRELAflTrAG^lmEKT;&apos;     &quot;Memo r an dimi by the Chancellor /of the Jbcche guer.I have arrived at a provisional arrangement in this matter with Sir James Craig and his colleagues whioh I have undertaken to put forward for the approval of the Cabinet-      I am still personally in favour of the amalgamation of the.Unemployment Funds &quot;of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and such an arrangement would also be acceptable to Northern Ireland Ministers as it would of course transfer the whole of the excess deficiency of their Fund to the amalgamated Fund,     But on the assumption that the Cabinet remain unwilling to adopt this solution Sir Jarnes Craig offers to postpone the initial date of the agreement made last August from 1st April last to 1st October,  the excess debt incurred by the Northern Ireland Fund during the intervening six months being added to the amount to be placed to the Suspense Account,  and the interest charges thereon being brought into account in future years. The effect of this postponement will be to reduce the estimated contribution to be made by the Exchequer this year to approximately the figure of  ,650,000 which I had originally contemplated.
As regards future years i3ir James Craig is unwilling to agree to the insertion in the Agreement of an over-riding maximiun for the contribution as I had desired,  but he undertakes to give me for publication a letter agreeing that,  if in any year the contribution exceeds  1,000,000, the Imperial Government shall be free, without breach of agreement, to reopen the question on its merits.      He also agrees to observe strictly the regulations adopted by the Ministry of Labour in this country and he invites the fullest possible inspection by their representatives of the Horthem Ireland administration.    (-See correspondence annexed.)In these circumstances I ask the Cabinet to approve the Agreement as now embodied in the Schedule to the Draft Bill attached,W,S.CaT re usury Chambers ,8th Pebruary,  1926.

The contribution from one Exchequer to the other in 5 respect of a financial year shall be a sum equal to three-fourths of such sum as may be required to equalise per head of the population of the respective countries the payments from the Exchequers of the respective countries into their respective unemployment funds in respect of that year (excluding any 10 payments on account of advances from those Exchequers to their respective unemployment funds but including, in the case of the country to which the poorer fund belongs, the amount of the equalisation payment).4.
