March 1926.SECRET.CP. 93 (26).Previous paper : CP. 24 (26).CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.AFGHANISTAN.My colleagues may care to read the attached extracts from a telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul regarding Afghan relations with Russia.BIRKENHEAD.Telegram from H.M. Minister at Kabul to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,dated 24th February 1926.No. 37. 24th February. Reference to recent correspondence beginning with my telegram No. 161 and ending with Government of India&apos;s telegram No. 320 S. Present political atmosphere in Kabul suggests extreme distrust of Russia, and tendency to gravitate towards Great Britain. If we play our cards carefully I-think that elimination of Russians from Afghan Air Force will be gradually secured, though not immediately.At my next audience with Amir I propose, on authority of your telegram No. 41 [vide CP. 7 (26)], to discuss, in frank and friendly spirit, general question of employment of Russian personnel in south-eastern zone.1045      100   3.26
