[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.ITALIAN   WAR   DEBT.1.   General Survey of the Question.The net amount of the Italian Debt to H.M.G., after allowing for all possible accounting adjustments (explained in section 2 (c) below), is        ...      ...      ...     ....The amount of the Italian Debt to the U.S.A. as funded is (at $4-86 to  1)    ......... 560 millions. 419 millions.In round figures therefore the net British debt is to the Americans as 4 is to 3.The Italians will no doubt claim that their Debt to this country should be funded on exactly the same terms as their debt to the United States of America.Italy&apos;s debt of  419 millions to the United States of America was funded by a settlement providing! for 62 annuities as follows :    1926-30      ...        1,029,0001931-40 1941-50 1951-60 1961-70 1971-80 1981-873,008,000 rising annually to 3,739,000 4,342,000 ,, 5,407,0006,471,000 8,877,000 11,604,000 15,236,0007,974,000 10,829,000 13,919,000 16,664,000If the Italian Debt to His Majesty&apos;s Government of  560 millions were funded on exactly the same terms as the Italian Debt to the United States Government of  419 millions the scale of payments would be : 1926-30 1931-40 1941-50 1951-60 1961-70 1971-80 1981-87    1,375,0004,020,000 rising annually to 4,997,0005,803,000 ,, ,,      ,, 7,226,0008,648,000 ,, ,,      ,, 10,657,00011,864,000 ,,                 ,. 14,473,00015,509,000 ., .,      ,, 18,603,00020,363,000 ,,                 ,, 22,271,000(For full scales in each case see Appendix 1).This scale (on the 3% per cent. Tables) is equivalent to a flat annuity for 62 years of  7,311,000. The initial payments, however, are very small, the amount of the flat annuity only being reached in 1950, and the later payments being proportionately heavy.There is no logical reason why we should grant the Italian Government the same terms as they have obtained from the United States of America, and we are clearly not bound to accept the same system in all its details as the United States of America accepted. We could indeed quite fairly claim that the settlement of the Italian debt to us should be based on the terms which the United States of America accorded to us, and not on the terms they accorded to Italy. In so far as we do not insist on full Baldwin terms, we&apos; are making a concession; and the extent of that concession should be limited to what we consider is the Italian capacity of payment. Now the present value of the Italian funding arrange-ment with the United States of America does correspond pretty closely with&apos; our estimate of what Italy can pay; but the precise scale seems to us to let Italy off too lightly in the earlier years and to put too heavy a burden on the later years.From our point of view it is much better to adopt with the Italians, if not the scale of payment, at least the system envisaged with Monsieur Caillaux for the settlement of the French debt, i.e., a flat rate of annual payments, commencing about 1930, with a short scale during the first four years only. Any departure from this system in dealing with the Italians will obviously make it much more difficult to clinch the Caillaux settlement. Moreover our Exchequers need for receipts at an early date is far greater than Americans.55733 A
On the other hand, the fact that the Italian payments to the United States of America will be small during the earlier years, and very heavy later on, makes it both possible and advantageous for Italy to make substantial payments to this country during the earlier years and correspondingly lighter payments at a later date.For these reasons the Treasury propose that the Italian debt to Great Britain should be funded on the basis of the following scale : years54 years1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934-87 1,500,000 3,000,000 4,500,000 6,000,000 7,500,000 7,500,000 7,500,000 7,625,000 8,000,000This scale (on the 3^ per cent. Tables) is precisely equivalent to a flat annuity for 62 years of  7,311,000, i.e., it is proportionately the same as the settlement made by the Italians with the United States of&quot; America.If the American settlement and the above Treasury proposal are compared on the basis of present values, both represent, on the 3^ per cent, tables, the payment by Italy of approximately one-third of her debts and the cancellation by the creditor powers of two-thirds of those debts : indeed, on the 41 per cent, or 5 per cent, tables, the percentage of the debt cancelled would be even larger.If the American settlement and the above Treasury proposal are compared on the basis of the aggregate payments, without regard to their present value, the Treasury proposal is more favourable to Italy as the total payments under that proposal represent 15 per cent, less than the total debt to this country, as at the date of funding, whereas the total payments under the American Settlement represent nearly 20 per cent, more than the total debt of Italy to the United States of America. (This method of calculation is, of course, not sound financially, but it may be useful for window-dressing purposes.)The scale of payments proposed by the Treasury cannot be regarded as beyond the capacity of Italy; indeed the aggregate payments due up to 1930 by Italy to Great Britain on this scale and to the United States of America under the recent agreements would be more than covered by italy&apos;s reparation receipts,* if the Dawes Annuities are transferred in full, and there would be a surplus of  1,791,000 in 1926, 951,000 in 1927, 1,746,000 in 1928, 2,281,000 in 1929. 1,613,000 in 1930.From 1931 onwards Italy would (on the same assumption) have to make a small contribution from her own resources but this would not rise to  1 million till 1941, nor to  4 millions till 1955.Under paragraph 9 of the agreement of the 18th February, 1919, the Italian Government gave us a charge for the repayment of a capital sum of  30,000,000 (pari passu with other lending Governments, as regards loans made after the 1st February, 1919), on her first receipts from reparation. It will be observed that this was a charge on any reparation receipts (not. merely on cash reparations). Italy has, in fact, received about  24,000,000 in reparation, but she has not made the above repayment either to us or, as far as we know, to the United States of America, who have a similar charge. The above agreement clearly entitles us, subject to- the pari passu claim of the United States of America, to olaimj all Italian reparation receipts in repayment of principal up to  30,000,000.* These are principally the Italian share (10%) of the Dawes Annuities : but the Italian share 25%) of the small payments by Hungary, Bulgaria and Czecho-Slovakia is also included.
Moreover we have always maintained that, given time, our debtors could reasonably be expected to pay something towards their debts from their own tax resources, as this country has to do.Appendix 1 gives for each of the years 1926 to 1987 : (1) Proposed scale of payments to H.M. Government. (2) Pari passu scale with Italian-American scale. (3) Scale if the Italian Debt were funded on terms offered to Monsieur Caillaux.(4) Italian Reparation receipts. (5) Italian Payments to U.S.A.(6) Excess (or deficit) of Reparation Receipts over payments to U.S.A.If the Dawes Annuities are only realised to the extent of 50 per cent, from 1928 onwards, the Italian Reparation receipts would amount to about  6 millions a year; the amount which she would have to provide out of her own resources from 1928 onwards would be only 1,600,000 in 1928,  2,000,000 in 1929,  2,700,000 in 1930,  5,000,000 in 1931 to 1933.From 1934 onwards her payments to Great Britain ( 8 millions) would be only greater than her reparation receipts ( 6 millions) by the amount of  2 millions.Italy has (apart from reparation receipts) a favourable balance in inter-national accounts of nearly  20 millions and as the result of the reparation deliveries she receives from Germany, she is relieved of sterling payments amount-ing to some  3 millions per annum which she regularly found before the War for coal imports from this country. The present burden of internal debt represents less than her pre-war debt burden, in terms of pre-war purchasing power, whereas her industrial production has increased in value by 40 per cent, above pre-war. (A fuller statement on these points is given in Section 3 of this Note below.)The scale proposed therefore appears to the Treasury the fullest measure of ,generosity which His Majesty&apos;s Government could, in fairness to the British tax-payer or the other Allies, concede to the Italian Government.   The extent of the concession offered may be illustrated by the following Comparisons : Equivalent flat annuity for 62 years of 1. Scale proposed (and also of scale exactly proportionate to U.S. scale) (on Z\ per cent. Table)......       7,311,0002. Scale on same terms as that offered to Monsieur Caillaux(on 31 per cent. Table)................     12,069,0003. Scale on terms on which British Debt to U.S.A was funded (repayment in 62 years with interest at 3 pen cent, for 10 years : then 3^ per cent.)   ......       ......     21,344,0004. Scale to repay the debt in full, viz., repayment in 62 years with interest at 5 per cent., a shade less than the interest actually being paid by the British taxpayer on the loans raised to enable War Loans to be advanced to Italy       ...       ..................     29,429,0002. The Amount of the Debt. (a) The gross Debt.The value as on 1st January, 1926, of Italian Treasury Bills held by the Treasury will be  592,474,215. The original capital advances amounted to  406,735,000 (of which about 75 per cent, was pre-Armistice and 25 per cent. post-Armistice), and the difference represents interest. Interest, or rather discount, at an average rate of 5-095 per cent., has been added to the capital as it accrues.55733
The interest has been charged at Treasury Bill rate and subsequently Bank Rate from 1916 till 1920 and at 5 per cent, from June, 1920, under the terms of the Financial Agreements. (For actual rates see Appendix 2.) The United States Government charged interest at 5 per cent, on all their Loans till April, 1919, and agreed to postpone interest on Debts for 3 years from April, 1919; when the British Debt to the United States of America was funded in December, 1922, arrears of interest were calculated at A\ per cent, simple. (In the American-Italian Agreement interest is calculated at 4J per cent, simple from April, 1919, till December, 1922, and at 3 per cent, simple from&apos; 15th December, 1922, till 15th June, 1925, the date of funding.)However lenient we may be as regards the future scale of payment by which the Italian Debt to this country is to be funded, we cannot agree to any recalculation of back interest in stating the amount which, as a historical fact, is actually due at the date of funding. The rates charged by us (just over 5 per cent, compound) are in accordance with the relevant Agreements and represent no more than the actual cost of the money borrowed by the British Treasury to lend to Italy. To recalculate interest on the Italian Debt to us on the same basis as that which the United States of America agreed to as regards the debt due to them would involve a reduction of  66 millions in the amount of the Debt as on 1st January, 1926.Still less can we accept payments only 13 per cent, above these to be made to the United States of America on the plea that the original capital of the Italian Debt to His Majesty&apos;s Government after deducting the gold deposited against it (reducing it to  384,500,000) is only 13 per cent, more than the original capital of the Italian Debt to the United States of America ( 339,000,000). Such a plea ignores both the terms on which the Loans were actually contracted and the dates at which they were made (we had lent  150,000,000 before the United States of America enterted the war).(b) Gold Deposit.Under the Nice Agreement of June, 1915, and the London Agreement of November, 1915,  60,000,000 and  122,000,000 respectively were advanced by the British Government to the Italian Government, being partly covered bv gold Shipments to this country of  10,000,000 and  12,200,000 respectively.The Agreements provided that the credits at the Bank of England in favour of the Italian Government arising out of the shipments of gold &quot; shall be a deposit not to be withdrawn until after the repayment of the advances, when the sums in question will be returned to the Italian Government in gold.&quot;Large advances were made subsequently to the Italian Government, without any gold backing.Certain negotiations took place in 1920 and 1921 the question being whether this gold was repayable only when all Italian debt was repaid or as soon as the Nice and London advances had been repaid. Finally on 22nd June, 1921, the Chancellor of the Exchequer informed Signor Bonomi that he did not think that the request made by a former Chancellor of the Exchequer that the Italian Government should agree &quot; not to ask for the return of the gold until the whole of the Italian debt to the British Government had been liquidated &quot; could be regarded as a modification, except in form, of the practical position with regard to this gold. He recognised however that the modification in the form suggested raised serious technical difficulties for the Italian Government, and in those circumstances he was &quot; content to leave the former position unchanged, it being understood, hoioever, that for practical purposes, the British Government must&apos; continue to regard the gold as a set off, against the total amcnint of the Italian Governm-enf s indebtedness to the British Government.&quot; The Chancellor was subsequently informed by the Italian Ambassador on 30th June, 1921, that his proposals with regard to the gold had been accepted by the Italian Government.The &quot; technical difficulty &quot; of the Italian Government is that this gold has continued to appear as gold held abroad in the statements of the gold reserve of the Italian Banks, and they cannot now correct the figures without revealing that the figures of their currency reserves hitherto published are, to this extent, fictitious.
This difficulty can be met by an arrangement similar to that proposed by Monsieur Caillaux as regards the similar gold deposit made by France, viz. : that the gold should remain as a non-interest-bearing deposit for 62 years, an equivalent amount of the original war debt being kept in cold storage, and that after the completion of the payments under the Funding Agreement/the Italian Government should have the right to redeem the gold by making additional payments to an equivalent amount.(c) Accounting Adjustments.During the process of liquidating the departmental accounts with Italy certain credits have been found to be due to Italy, chiefly as payments on account of the final amounts due to Italy in connection with the accounts of the Inter-Allied Wheat Executive and Inter-Allied War Risks Insurance Schemes and to a smaller extent owing to excessive or erroneous charges made by British Depart-ments. The Italians may claim that some or all of these credits should be paid to them in cash or applied to meet the earlier payments due under any Funding Agreement which may be reached.&apos; Any such claim should be unhesitatingly refused. Under Article 1 of the Agreement of 8th August, 1919, the various assets of the Italian Treasury ivhich should come into the hands of the British Treasury in future (inchiding those resulting from the liquidation of the Wheat Executive and War Risks Schemes) are to be devoted to the cancellation of Italian Treasury Bills held by the Treasury. Italian Treasury Bills amounting to  25,445,000 have been cancelled in accordance With these arrangements and the present total of the Italian Debt would be greater by over  25 millions if these credits had not been used to cancel Italian Treasury Bills.The Wheat Executive Accounts and War risks Accounts are now completed, but have not yet been agreed by the French and Italian Governments, as the accounts are very voluminous, technical and complex. The Wheat Executive Accounts show a balance of over  2 millions due to Italy, on which Italy will probably claim interest of  1J millions. Italy also has a very unconvincing claim against the Ministry of Shipping in respect of the transport of Iron Ore : in order to close the Departmental Accounts, the Treasury has provisionally offered to cancel Italian Treasury Bills for  1 million in full and final settlement of all outstanding claims, including the Iron Ore claim. There is also a balance of over  500,000 on the &quot; Italian Suspense Account &quot; in the books of the Treasury, which represents credits to Italy by various Departments which we have agreed to leave available for Stamp Duties on the renewal of Italian Treasury Bills by way of special exception to our right to use Italian assets to cancel Bills under the Agreement of 8th August, 1919.Thus, to sum up the position, we should be prepared in full and final settle-ment of all outstanding Departmental Accounts, including those of the&apos; Inter-Allied Wheat Executive and War Risks Insurance Schemes, to allow (for capital and interest) a credit of     ......       ...       .......       5,000,000.We should also be prepared, if the point is pressed by the Italian Delegation, to allow interest on the Gold Deposit from the date on which we used the gold, as we already have done in the case of the French Gold Deposit.  This would amountto ......       ......................       4,400,000(We can only agree to allow interest from the dates on which we used the gold.)Thus the debt as on 1st January, 1926, of............    592,474,215would be reduced by the value of the gold Deposit ...to ......................and again reduced by these further adjustments of to a figure of   ... the odd amount of 22,200,000  570,274,215  9,400,000  560,874,215  874,215would be paid off in cash and the amount to be funded would be ...   560,000,000.3.   Italian Capacity of Payment.A. Italy&apos;s Budget Position. &apos;(i) For 1924-25 there was an actual cash surplus of 2,077 million lire ( 181 million) on a Budget of 20,556 million lire ( 185 million) and for the first four months of 1925-26 a similar surplus of 563-1 million lire ( 4-J millions).55733 a 3
(The &quot; assets and liabilities Budget &quot; for 1924-25 shows a surplus of 417 million lire, i.e.,  3^ million only. It shows a lower surplus mainly because part of the cash, receipts represent arrears of taxation and are credited to previous Budgets. But the effect of these arrears ought to be taken into account in connection with Italian capacity to pay off debt.)(ii) The surplus is being used&apos;to pay off internal floating debt, the reduction of which is being] steadily accelerated by various funding operations.

Italian Economic Position.Industry.The gold value of the output of Italian industries is estimated to have doubled since 1913 and to be now 6 milliards of gold lire (see page 53 of the Department of Overseas Trade Report for 1925).
The following figures of increase of production since before the War in specific industries are available :-Steel : 68 per cent, increase in output.Textiles (omitting artificial silk) : Horse-power employed (1924) has risen 46 per cent.; number of workers has declined 21 per cent, as compared with 1911.Raw Cotton : Imports (1924) are at their pre-war level (about 200,000 tons).Raw Wool: Imports (1924) increased in value (gold lire) over four times about twice in bulk.--        Raw Silk (Cocoons) has increased 22 per cent, in output (1924).Artificial Silk : Production is increasing rapidly; 4-6 million kg. in 1923, 8 4 million in 1924 and 12-5 million (or 15 million according to one estimate) in 1925.Motor Cars : This is another rapidly growing industry. The greater part of the product is exported. In 1924 exports were valued at  4 millions as against about. 14 millions in 1913.The increase in industrial production since 1913 may be estimated at 25 per cent., and the increase in agricultural production at 10 per cent. Wheat Production has increased 16 per; cent., and Sugar Production 38 per cent. Italy-s consumption of Electrical Power since 1917 has increased at least 150 per cent. Population has increased 14 per cent. Unemployment (despite the increase in population and decrease in emigration) is negligible. As a result, national income is estimated to have risen from about  800 millions in 1913 to  1,150 millions in 1925 or nearly 44 per cent.F.-Arguments said to have been used by the Italian delegation at Washington.According to a Press Announcement made by the United States Government the Italian delegation submitted &quot; a documentation of 24 monographs composed of material gathered along scientific lines by the most prominent Italian statisticians and economists &quot;. The monographs are then summarised. Appendix 3 gives the nine points of the summary in inverted commas, with critical comments below each quotation. The arguments as a whole as stated in the summary seem singularly unconvincing.G. Arguments put forth by the United States Funding Commission.The United States Treasury, immediately after the Funding Agreement had been reached with the Italians, put out a semi-official ^communique of a most tendencious and misleading character with the object of attempting to show that the settlement made with the Italians represented approximately the same treatment as that accorded to Great Britain and Belgium.Appendix 4 gives the text of the communique with comments showing its fallacious character.

Summary of Italian Monographs and Comments.(1) &quot; Italy&apos;s burden in the War was equal to 30 per cent, of her total national wealth.!&quot;The burden on the Italian Treasury due to the War may for the purpose of &quot; Capacity of Payment &quot; be measured, or at least illustrated by the increase of her Internal Debt. The Internal Debt increase from  625 millions (pre-war) to  757 millions (present) is  132 millions. This is about 3 per cent, of her pre-war National Wealth (estimated at  4,,480 millions by Gini). British Increase of Internal Debt  6,000 millions or 41 per cent, of pre-war wealth (estimated at  14,500 millions by Stamp).&quot; She had lost 652,000 men and 458,000 of her youth were disabled.&quot;The 652,000 includes Missing. The number .of deaths was 460,000 or IS per cent, of 1921 population (French deaths 1,385,000, Great Britain 744,000 being 3&apos;5 and 1-6 per cent, respectively of 1921 population).   British Empire deaths 946,000.(2) &quot; Italy received no valuable colonies out of the war.&quot;The Mandated Territories are not a financial asset, but a heavy burden. We have spent some  160 millions on British Mandated Territories since 1st April, 1920 (including  80 millions on the Middle Bast). Italy, on the other hand, satisfied her national ambitions by large additions to her territory in Europe, which are of much greater national value than mandates over distant Colonies.(3) &quot; Italy&apos;s share of reparations is 10 per cent, as against 52 per cent, allotted to France and 22 per cent, to Great Britain.&apos;&apos;Italy has certainly no&apos;t received less than her share in proportion to her claims. She entered the War after a long period of neutrality. The devastation is much less than that suffered1 by France and her shipping losses much less than ours. The 22 per cent, is the share of the British Empire.(4) &quot; Italy, by immense sacrifices, has balanced her budget, reduced her governmental expenditure, and is the only great power whose military expenditures are to-day less than they were before the War.&apos;&apos;Defence Expenditure (Lecu/ue of Nations Report).

British Army (as on 1st January, 1923) 228,000 (114,700 in Great Britain).(5) &quot; Italy has been the only nation to tax war profits at 100 per cent, and to levy a capital tax.&quot;A capital levy has been tried not only by Italy but by Czecho-Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, Greece and Poland all countries whose system of direct taxation was inefficient or greatly affected by depreciation of currency. In the case of Italy the tax is collected over 20 years and represents an additional income tax. As regards war profits the Italian scale was a graduated one rising to a maximum otfl 60 per cent, in the case of manufacturers and 40 per cent, in, the case of agents. In 1920, a tax on capital increases was established at the nominal rate of 100 per cent., less various
deductions, but in fact it appears never to have been applied effectively as the total yield from 1921-1925 amounts to 1,038 million lire ( 10,600,000) only. The measure of the &quot; burden. &quot; of a tax depends noft on the nominal rate, hut on the effective collections; and in Italy, as in all Latin countries, it is notorious that owing to under-assessment all direct taxes are the subject of wholesale evasion.(6) &quot; The burden of taxation in. Italy, taking&apos; into account, the national wealth and the national income, is higher than that of any other country 38 per cent, of her net income after deducting a minimum of subsistence.&quot;The depreciation of currency has made the real burden much less than the nominal burden. Italian Taxation (Central and Local) is 16 per cent, of National Incomei; British Taxation is 21 per cent, of National Licome. The claim&apos; that a minimum, of subsistence should be deducted in order to measure taxable capacity is not admissible. There are great differences in. the standards of subsistence in different countries and different climates and there is no common measure available. The Dawes Committee, which inquired into this question fully, advised that &quot; as a rough working assumption, such a minimum may be regarded as varying in proportion to the per capita income of different countries,&quot; i.e. it must be disregarded.(7) &quot; Italy has none of the principal raw materials. She must import food and all her requirements in oil, coal, cotton, iron and copper.&quot;Italy produces at least 60 per cent, of her &quot;Wheat requirements and nearly all the other food needed.&apos; She has some iron and abundant water-supplies (which have enabled her rapidly to develop her electricity power, and this, together with the receipt of German coal on reparation account, has greatly reduced her dependence on imports of British, coal).(8) &quot; With her constantly increasing population, it is doubtful if Italy&apos;s industrial develop-ment keeps pace with the increased demands of her population.&quot; See above on Italy&apos;s Economic position.(9) &quot; Italy&apos;*s balance of trade has always been adverse.   During the past nine months she exported 13 billion of lire, and imported 20 billion, a balance against her of 7 billion, lire.&quot; This deals with visible trade only.Italy has valuable invisible exports (Tourists and Emigrants&apos; Bemittances) and including invisible&apos; exports has a substantially favourable balance of trade (estimated at  2$ millions for 1922 by General Confederation of Italian Industries. For 1924 probably in the neighbourhood of  20 millions).As a result, Italy has, im recent years, been steadily investing capital abroad, having made public loans for substantial amounts to Germany ( 1 million), Hungary ( 11 million), Poland ( 4 millions) as well as numerous investments of capital abroad effected by private undertakings.APPENDIX   4.. Communique by United Stater Government, with Comments.[The words of the Communique are in inverted commas.]Para. 1.. &quot; The British settlement calls for an annual average payment equivalent to 4-6 per cent, of the total Budget expenditure. The Belgian settlement calls for- an annual payment averaging to 3-5 of the total Budget ex2Denditures; an average for the two Budgets&apos; effort of about 4 per cent. If we should apply this average io the total Italian Budget expenditure as basis for Italy&apos;s settlement of her entire War debt toward the United States and Great Britain, we would reach an aggre-gate total maximum annuity of about 30 million dollars.&quot;The comparison here made is absolutely fallacious. In the first place, it compares the total British Budget including our payments to the U.S.A., and the Belgian Budget, excluding such payments : if this discrepancy is adjusted, the Belgian percentage becomes 2-J per cent, instead of 3  per cent. In the second place, any comparison between the total Budget figures is unscientific. The charge for internal debt varies immensely according to the extent of the depreciation of currency : for Great Britain it is  6,688 millions, or  152 per head; for Belgium it is  298 millions or  38 per head; for Italy it is  757 millions or  18 per head. But from the economic standpoint internal debts cannot be regarded as a burden in the same sense as external Idebts, and it is fairer to compare the net Budgets, excluding all internal debts and also public undertakings, such as the Post Office or State Bailways. The following table shows the pei-centage which the payments to U.S.A. bear to Budget expenditure on this basis:  	Initial Payments to U.S.A.	Average Payments to U.S.A.	Present value of Total payments.Great Britain ... Belgium Italy    ............	Per cent. 9 1-9 4-05	Per cent. 10 5-4 5-6	Per cent. 113 106 76Further the communique takes no account of differences in. taxation which, in the case of Great Britain,&apos;is  15 4s. per head or 17 per cent, of National Income, whereas in Italy it is
.--((65733)   Wt. 20425   125  12/25   H. St.   G. 18&apos; 3 10s. per head, or 12J per cent, of National Income. The.communique suggests that Italy, ought topay less because her currency is depreciated and her taxation is comparatively lower than this country.Para. II. &quot; The British settlement calls for an annual charge corresponding to 1-9 per cent, of the total British foreign trade (imports plus exports for 1924). The Belgian percentage is 0-88 per cent., the average of the two figures being 1&apos;4 per cent. If we should adopt the same criterion in determining Italy&apos;s basis for settlement of her total War debt towards the United States and Great Britain, the aggregate of Italy&apos;s maximum annuity would be about $18,800,000, her foreign trade for 1924 having reached 33-706 million lire.&quot;This comparison, based on the total, volume of trade, takes no account of the difference between a Free Trade Country with a large transit trade, and a country with a strictly Protectionist System, like Italy. &apos;.Para. III.. &quot; Great Britain&apos;s average annuity represents 0-94 of her national income (3,950 million pounds), Belgian&apos;s maximum annuity represents 0-80 of her national income (35 billion francs). The average of these two indices is 0-87 per cent. If we should apply this average to the aggregate national income of Italy (100 billion lire) as the determining factor for the settlement of her. total War debt to&apos; the United States and Great Britain, we reach a maximum aggregate figure of $34,800,000.&quot;The above calculation is made without prior deduction of a minimum of sub-sistence. If such minimum were deducted, as it should be, for each of the three nations; the Italian maximum annuity would fall to about $22,000,000.&quot;This is the only fair basis o-f &quot;comparison, but -the figures actually adopted are not in accordance with our estimates. The national income of Great Britain, should in our opinion be stated at  4,000 million, whereas the national income oif Italy should be put at not less than  1,150 million (or 134 billion lire). Even this latter figure is probably on, the low side as Italian national income is still to some extent affected by the depreciation of the lire. If these adjustments are made, the aggregate annual figure for Italy&apos;s debt payments will be increased from 34-8 million dollars to approximately 50 million dollars.Para. IV. &quot; A settlement of the Italian War- Debt towards Great Britain and the United States based upon the average of the three Belgian and British indices above mentioned, &apos;would entail an annual maximum aggregate payment of about $217,800,000.This conclusion follows from the premises taken and shares their falsity.Para. V. &quot; The Belgian settlement represents a burden of $1&apos;58 per capita of Belgium&apos;s population.   Reparation payments on the basis of&quot; the Dawes annuity would be three times as much, i.e., $4&apos;65 per capita of which amount Belgium, owing to her priority, has already cashed a large share (2 billions gold marks).   Italy&apos;s per capita reparation credit is only $1-16 as above mentioned.   Belgium&apos;s is $4&apos;65, France&apos;s $6&apos;04.&quot; This is the most absurd of all the comparisons.  On this basis, the Separation Eeceipts of the British Empire would be about 12 cents, per head and we ought therefore not to pay more than -V of what France pays or        of what Italy has to pay.   It is not the receipts per head that count, but the total receipts of the nation, and as Italy has a population of approxi-mately 40 million she has something over $40 million available for the payment of external debts. It should be added that throughout this communique -(a) no account is taken of the relative amounts of the various debts, i.e., the comparisonsare worked out as if the same payment were due for a debt of  50 million and a. debt of  500 million.   This is carrying the doctrine of capacity of payment ad absurdum;(b) the difference in the taper of the Italian scale and the British scale is entirely ignored. The communique&quot; speaks of &quot; average annual payments &quot; without regard to the fact that in the ease of Great Britain these are payable almost in full from the start, whereas in the case of Italy, they only commence to be payable after about 30 years.
