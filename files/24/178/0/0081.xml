CONFIDENTIALTWIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.JCRET.WTBO (26)CABINET.1REPORT OF THE FOOD COUNCIL ON SHORT WEIGHT. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I attach a copy of the Report of the Food Council on Short Weight and Measure (Cmd. 2591).The Cabinet will remember that they authorised me to proceed with the drafting of a Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the Food Council.    I propose that that Bill should be considered in detail by the Home Affairs Committee as Boon as it is ready.    In the meantime, I should be glad if I may have authority to announce that the Government accept generally the recommendations of the Report, and that we propose to prepare and introduce legislation based thereon.I have not attempted to summarise the Report, which is in itself a concise document founded on an enormous mass of evidence.   The specific recommendations are set out in large typo in the Report itself,    I would only offer the following observations as showing why we can, I think, confidently accept the Report.(l) It involves no new principle.    Coal, bread, and tea are already sold by weight under statute.(2) Legislation at present in force, for the prevention of short weight and measure is admittedly ineffective. This is serious as regards foodstuffs; and the recommendations of the Report are designed to cover effectively the important articles of food.(3) Local Authorities are practically unanimous in support of the proposals.(4) The proposals command a much larger measure of
support from trade associations than I had oxpected (see paragraphs 12, 13, 14 of the Report).(5). The proposals are entirely consistent with the general policy we are trying to pursue, namely, that without imposing control we should help buyers to help themselves and encourage honest traders in honest trading.Clntd.)

FOOD COUNCIL.Report to the President of the Board of Trade on Short Weight and Measure in the Sale of Foodstuffs.SlE,We beg to submit the following report on the subject of short weight and measure in the sale of foodstuffs.1. As a result of representations which had been made to them Terms of from time to time on behalf of local authorities, the Board of Reference. Trade requested us, on the 12th August, 1925, to consider and AnnexA(l). advise what measures, if any, should be taken for preventing short weight and measure in the retail sale of articles of food and -drink, other than tea and bread.   The sale of bread is at present governed by temporary regulations, and the Board of Trade subsequently agreed with our suggestion that the range which we should cover in our enquiry should be articles of food of general consumption, including milk and bread.   An announce- Annex A (3). ment to this effect was made in the House of Commons on 1st December, 1925.2. We referred the consideration of this  question to our Witnesses Executive Committee, who have, for the purpose of the enquiry, mmtax^&apos; held 17 meetings,, and heard 67 witnesses, and, in addition, have Evidence, received and examined a large amount of documentary evidence. The oral evidenee* and the material parts of the documentary evidence, have been published in 4 volumes during the last few weeks.   We have not accepted evidence as to the administration of the Weights and Measures Acts or as to the accuracy and relative merits of the various types of weighing and measuring instruments at present in use, as these matters do not, in our opinion, fall within our terms of reference.3. The Weights and Measures Act, 1878, (Section 26), pro- s^te of thevides for the punishment of persons wilfully committing fraud Law. in the using of any weight, measure or weighing rnstrument. The Section reads as follows : &quot; Where any fraud is wilfully committed in the using of any weight measure scale balance steelyard or weighing machine, the person committing such fraud, and every per-son party to the fraud, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding* act. In accordance with the present practice, formulated in the interests of economy, verbatim records of the examination of single witnesses were not taken, except in two instances where the evidence formed part of other, proceedings. A summary of additional statements made by single witnesses during their examination is appended in each ease. .....      &apos; &quot; &quot;

Certain provisions of the Sale of Pood Order, 1921, which are continued in force by the Expiring Laws Continuance Act, make it illegal ito sell any loaf of bread, (except fancy bread and rolls) &quot; unless its weight be one pound or an even number of pounds.&quot;4. Except as regards coal, bread and tea, no legislative enactment applicable throughout the United Kingdom exists for the specific purpose&apos; of preventing short weight and measure. In . Scotland, however, there are in operation the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1892, and local Acts such as the Glasgow Cor-poration Act, 1907, and the Edinburgh Corporation Act, 1913, which contain provisions designed to deal with this matter.5. Witnesses representing local authorities and Inspectors of Weights and Measures have explained that prosecutions under Section 26 of the Weights and Measures Act, 1878, can only be successful in cases where an Inspector actually sees the weighing or measuring operation, and can prove that fraud in the using of the weighing or measuring instrument is wilfully committed. As wilful fraud is very difficult to prove, the public obtains little protection from this Section of the Act even in cases where goods are weighed or ;measured in the presence of the purchaser. The Section cannot be applied at all for the purpose of preventing the giving of short weight or measure in goods not weighed or measured for the purpose of sale in the presence of a witness. In this connection, it should be borne in mind that a very large and rapidly increasing proportion of our staple foodstuffs is made up in packages, either by the wholesaler or the retailer, prior to the time of sale.6. The Merchandise Marks Act, 1887, can only operate to prevent short weight or measure in cases where the vendor gives an invoice or other written statement indicating the weight or measure of the goods. Moreover, local authorities are reluctant to allow their Inspectors of Weights and Measures to institute proceedings under this Act, as they run the risk of being surcharged with the expenses of such prosecutions since these would not arise out of the administration of the Weights and Measures Acts.
7. Of the Acts which are in operation in Scotland, it would appear that the Edinburgh Corporation Act alone, in the view of Scottish local authorities, effectively prevents short weight and measure. The Acts in operation in other Scottish cities and burghs provide for the punishment of any person giving short weight and measure, and include the following phrase : &apos;&apos; unless he (the accused person) proves that the deficiency in weight measure or number has arisen without any fraudu-lent intent.&quot;The inclusion of this phrase (which, was omitted from the Bdin-burgh Act, the most recent one) has apparently rendered ineffective those sections of the Glasgow Corporation Act and the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act designed to prevent short weight and measure. Although the Acts provide that the onus of proof shall rest on the accused, it has been found, in practice; that in any case where it is pleaded that there is no intention to defraud, the prosecutor is called upon to prove that deliberate fraud has been committed. Even an admission of gross negligence by the accused is sufficient to secure acquittal. &apos;&apos;8. The foregoing remarks are, we think, sufficient to indicate that existing legislation cannot effectively prevent short weight and measure in the sale of foodstuffs.9. The witnesses representing the local authorities and those representing the Society of Inspectors of Weights and Measures have quoted numbers of instances, gathered from various parts of the country, of tests which have revealed short weight or measure in the sale of foodstuffs. In Glasgow, where Inspectors of Weights and Measures have authority to weigh or measure packages of goods offered for sale, out of some 23,000 tests made during the past five years, short weight or measure was given in over 3,600 instances. In the Metropolitan district-of Essex, short measure in milk was found in 45 out of 63 cases tested, i.e., in over 70 per cent, of the cases. We have also received a number of complaints direct from members of the public, in-eluding tradesmen, quoting instances of short weight and measure. It may be urged that in many cases the deficiency is very small, but the effect of a series of small deficiencies in weight or measure on the housewife&apos;s weekly budget is never-theless considerable. The instances reported to us include, amongst many others, the payment for milk on the basis of the quantity actually supplied at 8 d. per quart instead of Id., for meat at Is. lid. per lb. instead of the marked price of Is. Sd., and for butter at 2s. 9d. per lb. instead of 2s. 6d. In one case of the supply of milk in bottles, of 130 bottles tested, 73 per cent, were found too small to hold a pint.   A calculationMacdonald, Vol. II, pages 5, 6, and 12, Q. 296-9.Inglis, Vol. IV, page 44.Macdonald, Vol. II, page 6, Q. 323, 334-5.Instances of Short Weight or Measure.Macdonald, Vol. II, page 13, Q. 330.*Card, Vol. I, page 18.Cole, Vol. I pages 6 and 7.* Note.-In a letter, dated 3rd February, 1926, Mr. Macdohald states that the 3,601 packages foiihd incorrect during the five years 1920-25 were all deficient in weight or measure.
based on the firm&apos;s own returns as to the quantity of milk sold and on, the assumption that only 50 per cent, (instead of 73 per cent.) of the bottles were deficient to the extent of those tested, showed that the firm would make an extra profit by short measure alone of ; 1,400 per annum.10. We do not in the least desire to suggest that the giving of short weight and measure is generally prevalent in the retail trade of the country or to overrate the extent to which the practice prevails.   It is, on the other hand, equally desirable both from the point of view of the consumer and from that of the honest trader, not to underrate the opportunities which the absence of adequate protection affords for giving short weight and measure, or the extent to which some tradesmen, as shown by the detailed evidence to us, take advantage of these opportunities. The local authorities of the country, who have had this subject under observation for years past, are emphatically of the opinion that protective legislation is urgently called for and is indeed long overdue.   An influential deputation l-epresenting the County Councils&apos; Association pressed this view upon the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade in May last, and the Association of Municipal Corporations in a letter to us of November 26th last renewed the request, made already to the Government from time to time, that legislation should be initiated.   We have had evidence in support  of legislation from the London County Council, the Corporation of Glasgow, the Middlesex County Council, and the Essex County Council, in addition to evidence submitted on behalf of the Society of Inspectors of Weights and Measures.11. We have taken cognisance of the legislation in operation in the British Dominions and in the United States of America and we are indebted to the Superintendent of Assize, Pretoria, and to the Director of the Bureau of Standards, Washington, who, through the agency of the Deputy-Warden of Standards of the Board of Trade, have furnished us with their observations on the legislation dealing with short weight and measure which is in operation in South Africa and the United States of America, respectively. It appears that in all the self-governing Dominions, and in the United States of America, there is in force legislation prohibiting the giving of short weight and measure and requiring the great bulk of foodstuffs to be sold only by net weight or measure.- -Consultation .12. We have consulted in detail the various branches of the with Trade trades concerned and we have done this as far as possible through Associations. the trade associations. These associations readily responded to our request to submit their views and to send representatives to give oral evidence. Speaking generally and allowing for the not unnatural disinclination of those engaged in trade to welcome any legislative interference, every disposition was shown to assist us in the enquiry.     No exception was taken to the generalOole, Vol. I page 9.
proposal that the giving of short weight and measure should be made an offence, subject to adequate safeguards being included in the law for the protection of the trade. The Association of Multiple Shop Proprietors informed us at the outset of their evidence that they substantially adopted and agreed with the proposals put forward by the London County Council, including that for the sale of a number of important foodstuffs by net weight. The Co-operative Societies stated that they found no difficulty in selling a large number of foodstuffs by net weight. The Scottish Federation of Grocers and Provision Merchants&apos; Associations, who state that they represent 70 per cent, of the private retailers in these trades in Scotland, agree that the present legislation is not adequate and that further legislation to protect the consumer is desirable. While setting out in detail the diffi-culties likely to be encountered in selling certain articles by net weight, they have materially assisted us to frame our proposals in such a way as to avoid these difficulties. They support very strongly the proposal that specified articles should be required to be sold in fixed weights, such as J lb.,   lb., and 1 lb., provided that the retailer is not required to mark packages containing such quantities with a statement of net weight. The evidence of the bakers&apos;, dairymen&apos;s, and greengrocers&apos; associations is referred to in the sections of this Report dealing with bread, milk, and vegetables (pars. 45-48, 49, and 32, respectively), and the pro-posals relating to the sale of bread, milk and potatoes meet for the most part with their approval. The same may be said of the position taken up by the National Federation of Meat Traders&apos; Associations with regard to the sale of meat.Oahill, Vol. HI, Q. 1160.Alexander, Yol. IY, Q. 1478.McClelland, Yol. IY, page 27.13. When the evidence of the Federation of Grocers&apos; Associa-tions of the United Kingdom is considered, a different and some-what discordant note is struck. This Federation state that they represent between 50 and 60 per cent, of grocers in England and Wales, but do not include -shops owned by multiple-shop companies or co-operative societies, or cover any part of the trade in Scotland or Ireland. The Memorandum giving the considered views of the Federation, which was submitted in writing prior to the attendance of the Federation^ representatives, contained statements which they could not justify and which on examina-tion they found it necessary to modify or withdraw. The Federation in their memorandum stated that they supported and accepted the proposal that tea should be sold by net weight, whereas their representatives before the Select Com-mittee of the House of Commons in 1914, which recommended the proposal, strongly opposed it. They wrote of increasing &quot; the already huge army of officials &quot; in a paragraph which they agreed could not be justified by facts. The Federation alone, of all the authorities and traders&apos; associations who appeared before us, intimated that they desired the subject to be further investigated by a Select Committee of the House of Commons, although it was pointed out to them that when appearing beforeAttitude ofFederationof Grocers&apos;associations of the united kingdom.James, Vol. I, Q. 91.Bennett, Yol.

They gave as their principal reason that,the whole of the evidence should be in public, and that a Select Committee would be more public than the Food Council although they inquired as to a&apos; private meeting on the ground that there might be things which they could not say in public. We undertook that all the evidence given would be published&apos; we pointed out that.the principal traders&apos; associations concerned would be consulted ; and we indicated that nothing could be done by way of regulations without an Act of Parliament in the first place, thus meeting all the objections which had been put to us.14. The Federation agreed that the giving of short weight and measure should be a penal offence. They agreed that there were other articles besides tea that could quite well be dealt with in the same way as tea; they promised to furnish us, as other trade associations have done, with a list of such articles, and they agreed that the provisions for the protection of the trade which were approved by the Select Committee in 1914, and which are incorporated in our proposals, were adequate. The Federation have since written to say that they are wishful of doing anything in their power &quot; to assist the Council to bring about some method whereby the wilful giving of short weight or measure shall be made a penal offence, due regard being paid for protecting the retailer against prosecutions in cases where-he is not personally responsible.&quot; We regret that the Federation, while thus admitting the.necessity for action, have been unable to approve of any of the suggestions which have been put forward by other witnesses for giving effect to this general principle, or to make any suggestion on their own account. The Federation^ witnesses seemed to rely on proposals for further inquiry and delay, and to be quite unnecessarily apprehensive of the efi on their trade of proposals which experience has already shown to be productive of nothing but good results.15. Our first recommendation is that it should be enacted that, where food is sold by weight or measure, the amount supplied to the purchaser shall not be less in weight or in measure (as the case may be) than the amount purported to be supplied.16. It will be obvious that a general provision such as that indicated in the preceding paragraph would not, in itself, prevent short weight and measure. In fact it might result in a rapid extension of the practice, which already is widespread, of selling goods in packets or containers without reference to weight or measure. It is clear, therefore, that there must be some obliga-tion on the retailer to sell as many as possible of the principle foodstuffs by weight or by measure, and in the following para-graphs we consider what is the best method of providing for this,17. There are two alternative methods of procedure, viz. :-(1) To enact that all foodstuffs, other than those exempted, shall be sold exclusively by weight or measure;
(2) To specify  those foodstuffs which  are&apos; to be&apos; sold exclusively by weight or measure&apos;. : \: ;  *Witnesses representing the Society of Inspectors of Weights and Cole, Vol. I, Measures, the Corporation of Glasgow and the County Councils&apos; macdonald&apos; Association favour the former alternative, on the ground.that the ana Hamil-number of articles which cannot be sold either by weight or by ton, Vol. II, measure is small.   They all agreed, however, that if it would ^4339 to facilitate legislation they would support the second course of Kyle, Vol. specifying the foodstuffs which should be sold by weight or HI, page 73. measure.    Other witnesses, representing the London County Card, Vol. I, Council, the Essex County Council and the Middlesex County page 22. Council, definitely take the view that the second alternative is y&quot;] 1jS0&quot;&apos; preferable.   With this view traders are in agreement, and we 2i. &apos; &apos; Pag6 are strongly of opinion that as a, first step it will suffice if the Jacobs, Vol. proposed legislation ensures that certain foodstuffs of common nl- Q-1028 consumption are sold exclusively by weight or measure. to.1039.18. But, even if vendors are required to sell certain staple Cross foodstuffs exclusively by weight, and are liable to be prosecuted We&apos;ght-in the event of deficiencies in weight, it does not necessarily follow that purchasers will in all cases receive the full weight-demanded.   As the law stands at present, it is quite legal, except in the cases of bread and tea, to- sell any foodstuff by &quot; gross &quot; weight, i.e., to include the weight of the wrapper or container as part of the weight of the commodity demanded.   A considerable proportion of the retail trade of the country is Alexander, transacted on the basis of net weight, not only in such com- 1500^b. modifies as meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, but also in groceries alld page 5&apos; and provisions.   The more general practice at the moment, haw-ever, is to retail groceries and provisions by &quot; gross &quot; weight, although certain traders are obviously dissatisfied with a system which gives any competitor a legal right to use wrappers of which the weight is entirely unreasonable.19. One or two of the trade associations have suggested that a standardisation-limit should be fixed by law as to the percentage of weight tio11 of permissible for tare.   Other trade associations consider this WraPPers-suggestion impracticable, and this was the view taken by the Collier and Select Committee in 1914.   We, too, doubt the practicability Purves, Vol. of the suggestion, and feel that it is preferable to apply as far as       ^jgg162 possible the principle of net weight to staple foodstuffs.   We are McClelland, disposed to think that any statutory limitation of the weight of Vol. IV, paper in. which goods are wrapped or any statutory enactment as P^8e 26-to the kinds of paper to be used for wrapping particular goods 1 qDi65 and would impose unreasonable restrictions on the trade both of ike.&apos; paper manufacturers and of vendors of foodstuffs, and might expose them to vexatious proceedings in the courts.   If food traders find that, as a consequence of the proposals which we make, the standardisation of wrapping papers is convenient, they will no doubt arrange for such standardisation in consultation with paper manufacturers.     In our view it is preferable that 56480 A 4&apos;
TJobinson, Vol. I, page 25.Macdonald, Vol. II, Q. 364.standardisation of wrapping paper should arise from voluntary co-operation between traders, rather than that it should be imposed by statute.Net Weight. 20. In the case of goods which are packed by wholesalers, there is clearly no difficulty in applying the principle of sale by net weight, subject to the adoption of safeguards for traders, to which we refer later (pars. 36-43). Tea is already sold by net weight in order to comply with the Sale of Tea Act, 1922. One of the objections put forward to the extension of this principle is that greasy and sticky substances can only be weighed it separated from the bare &quot; goods &quot; pan of a weighing machine by a wrapper of some sort, and that the placing of a counter-weight in the &quot; weights &quot; pan has been held to be illegal. We have been informed by officers, whose duty it is to administer the Weights and Measures Acts, that they see no objection to the use of a counter-weight in order to secure net weight. We ourselves consider that such a practice is entirely unobjectionable. As, however, there appears to be some misapprehension in this matter, we think it desirable that steps should be taken to make it quite clear that the practice is not illegal.21. Other objections which have been urged are that the use of a counter-weight will involve waste of the assistants&apos; time, possibility of confusion of different kinds of paper and waste of the counter-weight itself. As regard automatic weighing machines with only one pan, it is urged that exact net weight cannot be given because the nature of the machines does not permit of the use of a counter-weight. This difficulty would, McClelland however, in the opinion of the witness representing the Scottish Vol. IV, grocers, be surmounted by the use of wrappers heavy enough to page 27. register an indication of weight, or light enough to be regarded as negligible in weight. Generally, we do not consider that the objections raised have much substance, and we have no doubt that retailers will be able to comply with a statutory requirement that certain foods shall be sold by net weight exclusively. On this question the Director of the Bureau of Standards, United States of America, says :  &apos;&apos; We consider that a provision for sale by net weight o; measure is very necessary if fair competition is to be estab-lished among the merchants and justice done to the con-sumers. Sales by gross weight make accurate comparison: of competitive prices a very difficult matter, and are, in mn opinion, very conducive to the perpetration of fraud.&quot;The Superintendent of Assize, South Africa, states : &quot; My experience leads me to assert confidently that sals by gross weight should not be countenanced in any shap or form if the aim is the protection of the public.   .   . -Our experience is that the number of commodities which cannot be sold on the net weight basis is very small &apos;&apos;.

We recommend, therefore, that certain foodstuffs specified Certain below should be required to be retailed by net weight exclusively, 24. We have received from various trade associations lists of articles which can, in their opinion, be sold by net weight, subject exclusively, to the adoption of certain safeguards which will be referred to later.   After a careful examination of these lists, we recommend that the proposed Act should require the following articles to be retailed exclusively by net weight: Bacon and ham.Butcher&apos;s meat (excluding heads, feet, hearts, lights, andcalves&apos; sweetbreads). Butter, lard and margarine. Cheese.Cereals, the following : Flour and cornflour, oatmeal and rolled oats, rice, sago, tapioca.Sugar.Coffee, cocoa, cocoa powder and chocolate powder.Dried beans and peas.Dried currants, raisins and sultanas.Jam and marmalade.Potatoes.From this requirement should be exempted : Articles sold in quantities less than 2 ozs., or in single pennyworths or less.25. We do not, however, consider that a requirement to sell by Pale bynet weight is in itself of sufficient protection to the consumer. FixedThe Wholesale Distributors&apos; Association, in submitting a list of WeIShts-articles which should be sold only by net weight, state : &quot; Any22. The objections to sale by net weight now put forward are no stronger than those made when the question of short weight was considered by the Select Committee in 1914. The opposition then offered to the sale of tea by net weight. has entirely disappeared. Objection was taken by representatives of the baking trade in 1914, when it was suggested that bread should be sold at a definite weight, but, as will be seen from the evidence given to us, the bakers&apos; associations now think that it would be a retrograde step to sell bread in any other way. There can be no reason for singling out bread and tea as the only articles to be sold by net weight. That it is quite practicable to sell other foodstuffs by net weight is conclusively proved by the facts that such a requirement is very largely in operation in the Dominions and that a considerable proportion of the retail trade of this country, in such articles as butter, sugar, flour and cereals, is already conducted on the net-weight basis.
Vol. IV, page 38.G-uy Collier, Vol. Ill, Q. 1207.Alexander, Vol. IV, Q. 1494, 1496.of these commodities whicn. are usually sold in packets should, in the opinion of this Association, be multiples of J oz. up to 2 ozs., and multiples of 4 ozs. up to 1 lb., for reasons which will doubtless be obvious to your Executive Committee.&quot; A representative of the Association of Multiple Shop Proprietors stated : &apos;&apos; There has been a lot of trading done especially with imported goods where for some extraordinary reason best known to the packer of the article a 15-oz. packet is put on the market. I suppose it is to make people think that it is 1 lb., but 15 ozs. is plainly stamped on the package to protect them.&quot; The representative of the Co-operative Societies said that he saw no difficulty at all in adopting the suggestion that goods made np &apos; in packages should be sold only in standard quantities, and when asked for bis views as to the practice of selling in such weights as 15-ozs., replied : &quot; I should say the ultimate object is a com-petitive one. People get into this habit of getting a packet which is approximating to a pound and very often these things have been a pound at first and have been reduced to 15-ozs. That is, they are actually in unfair competition with those who continue to pack a pound. . . . &quot;We think that the least informed people should have a square deal and they are more informed on standard weights than anything else. I think we should adhere to standard weights wherever possible.&quot; The Superintendent of Assize, South Africa, says : &quot; I am convinced through long experience that the marking of the contents of packages in most instances where the quantities are not regular, but are in odd ozs. with fractional parts added, affords very little protection to the public. . . . There is the further fact that such irregular weights tend to unfair competition as between traders.&quot;26. In view of this evidence, we recommend that certain of the foodstuffs mentioned in paragraph 24 should be retailed only in quantities of 2 ozs., 4 ozs., 8 ozs., 1 lb. or multiples of 1 lb., viz.: Butter, lard and margarine.Cereals, the following : Cornflour, oatmeal and rolled oats, rice, sago, tapioca.Sugar.Coffee, cocoa, cocoa powder, and chocolate powder.Dried beans and peas.Dried currants, raisins and sultanas.Jam and marlmalade.Potatoes.Flour : In order not to disturb a practice which is general in many parts of the country, we think that it should be permissible for flour to be made up in quarterns and  -quarterns (i.e. 3J-lbs. and If-lbs.) as well as in the fixed quantities stated above.
15Prom the above requirements we would exempt : (a) Articles weighed in the presence of the purchaser or his agent.(b) Articles sold in quantities less than 2 ozs. or in single .    pennyworths or less.Bacon and ham, butcher&apos;s meat and cheese, have been omitted from this list owing to the physical difficulty of cutting from bulk the exact quantity required by the purchaser.27. It will be observed that the above lists include only articles of common consumption. Many will, no doubt, hold the view that other articles could well have been included, and we our-selves feel that experience will show additions to be necessary. In order to provide for this possibility, we recommend that Parliament should be asked to delegate to the Board of Trade powers to enable the lists to be varied by means of Regulations, which should be laid before Parliament for a minimum period of six weeks. Almost all the witnesses approved of this course. The trade associations concerned would presumably be consulted, as a matter of course, before any alteration in either list is made.28. Under the present system it frequently happens that no indication (or only an inconspicuous indication) is given to the consumer of the actual weight of the foodstuffs which he is purchasing. One witness informed us that, looking at a selection of articles in one of the largest shops in Glasgow, he found that no person was able to tell, with any possibility of certainty, what he was getting. The adoption of the proposal made above (par. 26) for the sale by retail of certain foodstuffs in fixed weights will enable the consumer to know the weight of those foodstuffs, since all sales will take place in definite units of weight Vvith which the consumer is well acquainted. While this will be the case both with foodstuffs made up in fixed weights by the retailer and with foodstuffs packed by the wholesaler for retail sale in those weights, we consider that the wholesaler should be required to place a definite indication of net weight on the out-side of packages made up by him, since such an indication would provide the simplest form of warranty.29. It is already the practice of wholesalers to print on the outside of the packages many particulars amongst which a state-ment of the net weight can easily be included. Moreover, it will be in the interests of wholesale packers themselves, particularly in cases where loss in weight through evaporation may be appreciable, to make it clear to purchasers that at the time of packing or importation the packages contained the full weight demanded.30. We therefore recommend that all the articles mentioned in paragraph 24 should, with the exceptions noted below, when sold by retail be delivered to the purchaser with a legible state-ment of the net weight; in the case of foodstuffs made up in47?Power to be given to the Board of Trade to vary the Lists.Legible Statement of Net Weight.Macdonald, Vol. II, Q. 400.

In connection with this recommendation, we have con-sidered a suggestion made by the Incorporated Society of Inspectors of Weights and Measures, which has been supported by most of the witnesses representing local authorities, that meat, when delivered at the house of the purchaser, should be accom-panied by a ticket showing the true weight and the price per lb. of each purchase. The London County Councils representative stated that that Council had received a greater number of com-plaints with regard to short weight in meat than in other articles, and they supported the proposal for this reason. The repre-sentative of the National Federation of Meat Traders&apos; Associa-tions stated in evidence that it is at, the present time customary to ticket in the way suggested meat delivered to the purchaser^ house, and that &quot; a man would be an exceedingly bad trader if he did not do that.&quot; The Co-operative Societies also support the proposal. Its feasibility is shown by the present practice of the trade and by the precedent in the South African Weights and Measures Regulations, 1923, which provide that when meat is conveyed for delivery a ticket shall be sent with it stating clearly the name of the purchaser, the weight of the meat to be delivered, and in addition, when required by the purchaser, the price of such meat. We consider that to some extent the situation will be met by the recommendation made above (par. 30) as to the delivery of certain articles to the purchaser with a legible statement of the net weight, but we recommend that when butcher&apos;s meat is conveyed for delivery to the purchaser a legible statement of the net weight of the meat should be sent with it, whether the meat has been weighed in the presence of the purchaser or not. It wall be open to the purchaser, if he so wishes, to arrange with the vendor to include a statement of the price.32. It will be observed that we have not included in the list given in paragraph 24, fish, fresh fruit, or vegetables (except potatoes). The reason for this is twofold. Firstly, the consumer frequently desires to purchase many of these commodities by number and there can be no objection to a continuation of this custom. Secondly, retail traders in fish, fruit and vegetables, have complained of the irregularities which are said to exist, to an unusual degree, in the sale of those commodities by wholesale,
17asand while they state that they would not attempt to defend the Vol. II, pageretailer who passed on to the consumer the short weight which 76.he himself received, we feel that it would be a hardship to requirethe retailer to unpack and1 weigh the contents of packages receivedfrom the wholesaler.   We have not had an opportunity fully to investigate these complaints, but we hope to be able to do so when we are making our enquiries into these trades from the pointof view of food prices.   Meantime we understand that the horticultural Advisory Council (appointed by the Ministry ofAgriculture and Fisheries) on which all sections of the fruit and vegetable trade are represented, are considering the general question of the sale of agricultural produce by net weight or countor standardised package.   If it be found that the public isprejudiced by the non-inclusion of fish, fruit and vegetables inthe list of articles which must be sold by net weight, the Board ofTrade will, no doubt, use promptly the powers which we havesuggested should be entrusted to them of amending the list bysupplementary regulation.   We have included potatoes in the list by reason of their primary importance as a foodstuff and also because the Corn Sales Act of 1921 provides that a contract inpotatoes is null and void unless it is made by weight only andin terms of and by reference to the hundred weight of 112 lbs.33. The question of the inclusion of jam and marmalade in the Jam. list of articles which should be sold by net weight has engaged our careful consideration.   The Food Manufacturers&apos; Federation Wildblood, intimate that it is not the practice to sell jam by weight, and Vo1-      Q-that the method usually adopted is to sell jam in quantities of approximately 1 lb., 2 lbs., and 3 lbs., described as &quot; ones,&quot; &quot; twos &quot; and &quot; threes.&quot;   The Federation assert that these jars are made to a standard of overflowing water capacity, which results in consumers receiving full weight on the average but not necessarily in each individual case.   They have represented to us that there are two possible sources of error in endeavouring to sell jam by exact weight, viz., unavoidable variation in capacity of apparently similar jars, and variation in density or specific gravity of the various jams manufactured.   They object Macara, Vol. to the suggestion that jars should be made sufficiently large to ln. Q- l342-allow for this variation on the ground that with the best jams the larger jars might hold over 17 ozs.   In other words, it is possible that in certain cases the jam manufacturers would be giving overweight to the extent of 1 oz. or slightly more in the lb.34. We are not at all impressed by the evidence of the English jeSsop, Vol. grocers&apos; federation that the customer who goes into a shop to I, Q.77 to 82. buy jam asks for a jar of jam, and that he either buys by price or &quot; the assistant will very likely put different sizes on the counter&quot; for the customer&apos;s choice or says, &quot;Ones a shilling, twos so much.&quot; The fact is that the customer asks for a 1-lb. or 2-lb. pot, and so on, and in many cases believes he is getting that weight of jam.
35. The    Feed   Manufacturers&apos;    Federation    propose   the standardisation of a jar with a water content of 12J fluid ozs for 1 lb., and so on, but they state that, while this jar would oive on an average 1 lb., it would admit of variation up to f oz. without allowing for evaporation, which would add to the loss. On the other hand, Messrs Wm. P. Hartley, Ltd., a leading firm of jam manufacturers, state that a jar with this water content, even if enforced, would not contain 1 lb. of jam on the average, and that to ensure this it would be necessary to provide a jar holding 13J fluid ozs. of water.    Messrs. Hartley state that they guarantee the weight of their jam, that they make their own earthenware jars and that it is quite feasible to guarantee, to within 1 per cent., &quot;the capacity of any jar (whether of glass Vol.IV,       or earthenware). - They point out that jam imported into the page 45.       United States of America will not be admitted by the Customs authorities there unless the containers are marked with the net weight, and that even the words &quot;at the time of packing&quot; Macdonakl,   formerly allowed have now to be omitted.   They hold the view Vol. II, Q.    that some manufacturers deliberately order pots which will not hold the weight of jam purported to be supplied, and this is sup-Jacobs, Vol.  ported by the evidence of the Glasgow Inspector of Weights and , Q. 11   . jyreasureSj an(j Dy the evidence of the London County Council.That there is ground for objection, even if an odd weight is stated, is shown by a complaint recently made by a Hartlepool grocer that he had ordered a quantity of 1-lb. pots of jam and that when they were received he found a small slip on them stating that the pots contained 14 ozs. It is interesting to observe that the Superintendent of Assize of the Union of South Africa states thai &quot; there is the further fact that such irregular weights tend to unfair competition as between traders. Prior to the into duction of the present regulations large quantities of jam were made in the Union in all kinds of irregular weights ranging from 11J ozs. to 16 ozs., but in each case represented as 1 lb. Jams are now required to be put up in quantities of 8 ozs., 1 lb., or an integral number of lbs., and this measure has given the greatest possible satisfaction to the public and to the retail dealers. Tin producers offered all sorts of objections to the proposals but have now settled down to the packing of the prescribed weights,&quot; Jam has also to be sold in other countries by net weight, and in view of this and of the practical experience of a firm like Messrs. Wm. P., Hartley Ltd. in this country, we see no reason whj jam and marmalade should not be included in the list of articles to be sold by net weight and by fixed weight.Safeguards 36. In making these recommendations we have not overlooks for Traders, ^e practical difficulties which have been laid before us 1)] traders.

19479Goods. Annex B.be provided in these respects.   They are similar to those recom-mended by the Select Committee on Short Weight in 1914.37. The weight of some foodstuffs is subject to appreciable Evaporation variation by reason of climatic influences, as experiments con- rrl^s&apos;Packed ducted by the Standards Department of the Board of Trade show. As regards goods packed in this country, this difficulty is met by the proposal in paragraph 30 that the weight indicated on the package or container should be the net weight at the time of packing. In the case of goods packed abroad, the weight indicated should be the net weight at the time of importation. .. .It has been suggested to us that the object of the proposed legislation might be defeated by the packing of goods in an unduly moist condition. We do not think that this contingency is likely to arise, since the quality of most foodstuffs would deteriorate were such a doubtful practice adopted. However, the point could be met by the insertion of a proviso that the foodstuffs must be packed with due care and in such a condition as to ensure that no avoidable loss in weight through evaporation or any other cause takes place after packing or after importation (whichever is the later).38. Traders who receive foodstuffs packed ready for retail Warranty sale should be protected from prosecution by warranty clauses Clauses, similar to those appearing in the Schedule to the Sale of Tea Act, provided that the qualification in Clause (5) of that Schedule Annex c. be omitted.    We think that, in no circumstances, should a warranty given by a person resident outside the United Kingdom be available as a defence.39. We suggest that powers should be given to Inspectors to weigh the contents of packages on the premises of wholesalers, packers and importers, as well as of retailers. In the case of imported packages, it will probably be found convenient, if it-is desired to test the weight, for the tests to be carried out before the packages have been cleared by the Customs Authorities.40. No difficulty as regards evaporation can arise in the case of goods weiglied in the presence of and immediately handed to the purchaser or his agent. When, however, such a com-commodity as meat is delivered to the purchasers house, there may be loss in weight from evaporation and. drainage. We therefore consider that there should be a provision safeguarding the trader from prosecution for the giving of short weight in cases where the deficiency is due to unavoidable evaporation or drainage and has occurred in spite of due care having been taken to avoid such deficiency.41. We think that in order to protect traders from the possi- Vexatious bility of vexatious proceedings, regard should be had in the case ^^ep^s&apos; of goods sold in packets or containers to the average weight or Mistakes or measure of the contents of a number of packets or containers Accidents, exposed for sale.   Further, a defendant should be entitled toEvaporation from Unpacked Goods and . Drainage.Annex B.Walter, Vol. IT, Q. 428 to 431.
be discharged if he can prove that the deficiency is due to a bona fide mistake or accident after all precautions have been taken to prevent a deficiency.42. It is only reasonable that the employer should not be required to bear the consequences of spontaneously dishonest acts on the part of his employees. The National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, however, object to the suggestion that employees should be prosecuted on a charge of having given short weight or measure, while the Journeymen Butchers&apos; Federation take the view that in no case should an employee be prosecuted unless his employer is also prosecuted in respect of the same offence. Both the Union and the Federation envisage the possibility of a shop manager or assistant being convicted when an offence has been committed with the connivance or encouragement of the employer. Statements have been made to us in evidence which tend to show that occasionally an employer may be partly responsible indirectly if not directly  for deficiencies in weight or measure, even though, prima facie, the employee may appear to have been acting without the sanction or knowledge of the employer.43. The Margarine Act, 1887, and the Shops Act, 1912, each contain a provision to the effect that, when an employer is charged with an offence against the Act, he shall be entitled to acquittal provided that he lays an information and successfully prosecutes the actual offender. The Select Committee on Short Weight, in 1914, recommended the adoption of a similar pro-vision in short weight legislation. Since that date, statutes relating to *milk and dairies have, in addition, provided that where it appears to. a. local authority that an offence has been committed in respect of which proceedings might be taken against a purveyor of milk, the local authority shall, if reasonably satisfied that the offence of which complaint is made was due to an act or default of a servant or agent without the knowledge, consent, or connivance of his employer, take proceedings against the servant or agent without first proceeding against his employer. We recommend that similar provisions be included in the proposed Act.Negligence.       44. We have already referred (par. 5) to the difficulties which local authorities have experienced in proving that an offence is &quot;wilfully&quot;   committed.   It  should not  be possible,  as has proved to be the case in connection with the administration of Macdonald,   Section 60 of the Glasgow Corporation Act, for a person charged Vol. II, Q.    with an offence under the proposed Act to escape conviction by 323, 334-5.    pieaciing negligence.

480impossibility of proving the state of mind of the man committing the offence, and it is added that experience has shown the justice of this omission.45. We have consulted the trade associations concerned on the Bread, draft Sale of Bread Bill,, a copy of which was enclosed with the Annex A (2) Board of Trade letter to us of 12th August, 1925, and we find that the great majority of bakers are in favour of the main pro-visions of the Bill. Clause 1 (2) of the Bill provides that &apos;: A person shall not, either by himself or by any servant or agent, sell, or have in his possession for the purpose of sale, or deliver under a contract of sale, any loaf of bread unless its weight be one pound or an integral number of pounds,&quot; but Clause 1 (5) provides that &quot; The provisions of this Section shall not apply to fancy bread, or to loaves not exceeding twelve ounces in weight.&quot;46. The Bill does not, however,, attempt to define fancy bread, Fancy Bread and, so far as we are aware, no recognised definition exists. ^d ^ales. Absence of such definition might be held to give encouragement to the production of loaves which, while described by the vendor as &quot; fancy bread &quot; (and therefore not subject to the requirements of the Act), are intended for consumption as ordinary household bread.   If this practice were to become general and the bread so produced as fancy bread were regarded as such by the Courts, a state of affairs similar to that which exists in Scotland (to which we refer in the next paragraph) would result.   We have therefore given careful consideration to the question of defining &quot; fancy bread &quot; and we have examined definitions suggested by two associations of bakers.   We are not satisfied that either of the definitions is suitable for incorporation in legislation, or would assist the Courts in coming to a decision in particular cases.   The Jennings, term &apos;&apos; fancy bread &apos;&apos; has been used in legislation without defini- Vol. I, Q.;29. tion since 1822, and a witness, whose technical knowledge will not be disputed, informed us that &quot; it seemed to be impossible to get any real definition.&quot;   Further, we have received no evidence that the clause of the existing Sale of Food Order relating to Annex D. bread is being evaded in England and Wales to any material extent in the absence of a definition of &quot; fancy bread.&quot;   In the circumstances we feel that it is not desirable to include in any new legislation a definition of the term.47. The position, is, however, verv different in Scotland. Fancy Bread Clause 1 (6) of the Sale of Bread Bill provides that &quot; In the in Scotland, application of this section to Scotland, &apos; fancy bread &apos; shall not include a pan loaf, French loaf or any other loaf of a similar character.&quot; In Scotland, the bread most comfmonly consumed is &quot; batch &quot; bread, which is bread in the form of square loaves baked in batches in one piece; when separated, for sale the four sides of each loaf are crumb and only the top and bottom are crust. The &quot; pan &quot; loaf is somewhat similar in shape to the &quot; batch &quot; loaf, but is covered with crust, like the ordinary

The Scottish Association of Master Bakers are strongly opposed to the clause quoted above, which has the effect of requiring pan, French or crusty loaves sold in Scotland to be sold in weights of 1 lb. or multiples of a lb. At the same time they suggest that pan, French and crusty loaves should be sold at a fixed weight of 1 lb. 12 ozs. Basing their views on a Scottish Sheriff Court decision in 1898, the Scottish bakers urge that these loaves are &quot; fancy bread &quot; and do not therefore fall within the conditions applicable to the ordinary loaf. They add that the Scottish consumer prefers to pay the same price for his loaf whether plain or pan, and would prefer to have one 4 ozs. less in weight than the other provided the price is the same. They claim that the pan loaf costs more to make, both as to ingredients and labour, but these points are disputed. The opposing view, which has been put to us very strongly by the Scottish local authorities, is that the recognised weight of all kinds of loaf bread should be the same and the difference, if any, in quality as regards pan, French and crusty loaves should be adjusted if necessary in the price, particularly as these loaves are in common, and increasing consumption and are stated to amount to from 30 to 50 per cent, of the bread consumed in Scotland. Their evidence is that a large number of the com-plaints of consumers are found on enquiry to refer to pan bread, and as this bread has been sold at weights varying from 1 lb. 6 ozs. to 2 lbs. 1 oz. at the same price as plain batch bread, it can clearly be sold at 2 lbs. without difficulty. In fact it was so sold during three years of the war period, certain adjust-ments having been made by the trade ; and the Scottish Co-operative Societies, by a large majority, are in favour of making the pound the unit of weight for all these varieties of bread. This question is pre-eminently one for Scotland, but for our part we would deprecate the introduction of a new recognised weight for the loaf. We do not agree with the Scottish Master Bakers&apos; Association that the unanimous views of the Scottish local authorities, who may be presumed to represent the con-sumer, &quot; make no difference at all,&quot; and we entirely agree with those authorities and with the Scottish representative on this Council that all kinds of loaf bread in Scotland should be sold on. the same basis of weight.48. we recommend that the provisions of the draft Sale of bread bill should be incorporated in the legislation now proposed.This will obviate the necessity of continuing each year by the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Act the provisions of those Sections of the Sale of Food Order, 1921, which relate to bread.* Note.

We recommend that foodstuffs consumed in restaurants or on the vendor&apos;s premises should be exempt from the obligation to sell by net weight or measure.51. We have already referred to the practice of certain packers of goods who indicate the weight of the contents of packages in very inconspicuous characters and letters. Our attention has also been drawn to the practice of certain traders who exhibit price and weight tickets on foodstuffs which are clearly designed to mislead purchasers. We, therefore, recommend that all figures, letters and other indications of weight or measure exhibited on foodstuffs offered for sale should be clear and conspicuous, and that no indication of weight or measure which is calculated to deceive should be exhibited.Exemption of Food Consumed in Restaurants,, etc.&quot; Fake &quot;-Tickets.52. We also recommend that oral misrepresentation of weight Oral Misre-or measurement should be an offence. presentation.53. It has already been indicated that one of the sources from Position of which short weight and measure arises is the fact that many JJg^&quot;^01 purchasers are not in a position to observe the process of weighing t^&quot;^^?. and measuring the goods they are purchasing.   We consider that in cases where the weighing or measuring of any foodstuffs takes place in the presence of the purchaser the weighing or measuring appliances should be in such a position that the purchaser can read all indications of weight or measurement.54. Except in so far as packed goods are concerned, we have &quot;Wholesale not consulted in detail the wholesale food trades on the question Tra(!le-of short weight or measure.   Certain retailers (in addition to49. The evidence which we ha-ve received with regard to; the Milk, giving of short measure in milk has convinced us of the urgent necessity of legislation to prevent this practice, which, from the evidence given to us, appears to be astonishingly prevalent. We think that in addition to the general provision against the giving of short measure, special steps should be taken to prevent the use of bottles containing slightly less milk than the quantity which the consumer might reasonably be expected to demand. We understand that these bottles are sometimes sold bearing the words &quot; 9/10ths of a pint,&quot; or a label stating that no specific quantity of milk is guaranteed. The object of the vendor is fairly obvious; he hopes that the quantity of milk in the bottle will be mistaken by the public for a pint and he charges the current price for a pint. The National Federation of Dairymen&apos;s Associations agree that milk should be sold only by standard measure and, in order to put the sale of milk on a satisfactory basis, we recommend that fresh milk, except when sold in single pennyworths or less, should be retailed only by imperial measure and in quantities of half a pint or multiples of half a pint.
Jessop, Vol. I, Q. 285.those engaged in the fish, .fruit and vegetable trades to which we have already referred) do not in all cases appear to be able to protect themselves effectively against the&apos; possibility of short weight being given by wholesalers. We, therefore, suggest that our main recommendation, namely, that the giving of short weight or measure should be a statutory offence, should apply to wholesale trade as well as to retail trade. The Wholesale Distributors&apos; Association, the National Federation of Produce Merchants, the London Dried Fruit Trade Association and the National Federation of Fruit and Potato Trades Associa-tions have accepted the principle under-lying this recom-mendation, and we do not imagine that the vast majority of wholesale traders will have any objection to&apos; it.Method ofAdministra-tion.55. We propose that the powers of administration of the suggested new Act should be vested in local authorities at present administering the Weights and Measures Acts. We do not, however, think that such powers of administration should be entrusted to local authorities which are not in a position to employ a full time Inspector for this work. It seems to us highly undesirable that the proposed new legislation (or indeed the existing Weights and Measures Act, with which we are not, however, concerned) should be administered by part time officers, receiving a very low salary, who are appointed by a local authority which may be composed largely of local retail traders.Robinson, Vol. I, page 25.56. Witnesses representing local authorities have stated that the administration of the proposed legislation would not necessitate any large increase in staff. It may be useful here to reproduce an extract from the evidence of the witness repre-senting the Middlesex County Council :  &quot; My experience has shown that, when a new Act com-mences to operate, the existing staff of Inspectors of Weights and Measures direct their attention especially to the pro-visions of the new Act, reducing work under the older Acts, as those will have become better known, and better observed. As the traders become acquainted with any law, the work thrown on to the Inspectors by that law correspondingly diminishes. The duties of the Inspectors are not limited to enforcing Acts and to prosecuting; a large part of their duty is to make the law known. Because of this, the increase in the inspecting staff which might be necessitated by the proposed legislation would be not nearly so great as might prima facie be expected; and in some districts no increase of staff would be needed.&quot;Jacobs, Vol. Ill, Q. 1H0.This view is supported by the evidence of the London County Council, who say that the increase would be quite small and might only be temporary.
57 We have had our attention drawn to a recommendation of Period fer the Select Committee on Short Weight, 1914, that &quot; The limit of Laying In-48 hours fixed by the existing Acts for laying informations before formatlons-Justices be increased to 28 days.&quot;   One of the trade witnesses Stephens, pointed out that the adoption of this recommendation (which is ^&quot;to^eo&apos; contemplated in  Clause 1   (4)   of the draft  Sale of Bread Bill) would be a hardship to the trader, and we feel that, even    though    the    trader    may    have    been    acquainted without delay of the fact that an inspection has been made, the interval between the inspection and the notification that proceedings would be taken should not be unduly prolonged. We are of opinion that the interval should be limited to 14 days.58. In order to allow manufacturers and packers of foodstuffs Commence-to make any necessary changes in their packing arrangements, operation of we think that the suggested provisions of the proposed Act which proposed 0 relate.to packed goods should not apply until six months after Act. the date on which the Act is passed, and that a similar period should elapse between the dates of issue and commencement of operation of any regulation affecting packed goods made by the Board of Trade pursuant to the Act.59. We would say, in concluding this Report,, that it seems Conclusion, to us to be quite impossible to ignore the experience of the local authorities of the country or the unanimous views and proposals which they have put before us, or to fail to realise, when refer-ence is made to legislation by the other countries we have referred to, how much this country lags behind in the elementary business of securing that the consumer gets what he asks for and pays for. Nor does it accord with common sense that, while elaborate machinery is established by law to ensure that sellers should provide themselves with correct scales, weights and measures, no provision should exist for ensuring that the quantities of foodstuffs actually sold should be what they are represented to be, with the two exceptions of bread and tea. In the absence of provisions making the giving of short weight and measure a penal offence, it is obviously possible for a retailer so inclined to keep his apparatus in perfect order and yet to give short weight and measure almost at will, while the inspectors are powerless to interfere. To avoid this, the work of supervision should include the amount of the goods delivered. It has been suggested that the consumer should protect himself, but when large retailers urge that they cannot face the wholesaler who does not give them the quantity he purports to sell and that they need vinden, Yol. the protection of the law and its enforcement by inspectors in II, Q- 955 to order to safeguard them, it can be seen how futile it is to expect 969-the housewife to defend herself against those traders who give short weight and measure and who would refuse, probably with emphasis, to admit any fault or to accept her evidence.

Suggestions that the cost of living would be increased by the selling of goods by net weight, i.e., in giving the consumer the goods for which he pays, or that unemployment would be caused by so doing, serve only to show the weakness of the case against proposals for dealing with admitted abuses.60. With regard to our proposals, which are summarised below, it is fair to say that the use of the words &quot; impracticable &quot; or &quot; impossible &quot; can no longer be justified. They have the force of law in other countries, and most of them have to some extent been&apos; voluntarily adopted in this country. The principle governing them has already been accepted in the Sale of Tea Act, 1922, and the clauses of the Sale of Food Order relating to bread, and the experience gained in the administration of these measures has demonstrated that they work satisfactorily and have attained their object of reducing to a minimum the giving of short weight in the sale of tea and bread. We cannot find any reason against extending the principle to other staple food-stuffs. We have been at pains to consult the traders in detail, to meet their views and to secure their co-operation and goodwill. There is agreement as to the necessity of further protection for the consumer, and on the principle that the giving of short weight and measure should be made a penal offence, and the safeguards we suggest for the trader are accepted as adequate.61. We earnestly trust that it will be possible for legislative effect to be given to the proposals contained in this Report during the present session of Parliament.62. We desire to express our appreciation of the manner in which our enquiry has been organised, and the efficient way in which the available material has been prepared for our con-sideration by the Secretary to the Council and by his staff, of whom we wish specially to bring to your notice Mr. H. Beer, on account of the excellent work which he has done.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)   Beadbuby,Chairman.The Rt. Hon. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, K.B.B., M.C., M.P., President of the Board of Trade.oth. February, 1926.

i8ii29 -ANNEX A (1).Board of Trade, ^ (Industries and Manufactures Department), Great George Street,London, S.W.1.12th August, 1925.Sib,I am directed by the Board of Trade to state, for the information of the Food Council, that they have had before them the question of taking further measures for preventing short weight and measure in retail trade, concerning which representations have been made to them on behalf of local authorities from time to time, and have recently been renewed by the County Councils Association. I am to enclose herewith for your con-fidential information copy of two memoranda&quot; prepared in this Depart-ment which indicate the history of this question before the war and the present position, together with notes of a deputation from the County Councils Association which was received by Sir Burton Chadwick, Parlia-mentary Secretary to the Board, in May of the present year.Legislative provision for the prevention of short weight or measure in the sale of coal, tea and bread already exists in the Weights and Measures Act, 1889, as regards coal, in the &quot;Sale of Tea Act, 1922, and as regards bread in the Sale of Bread Acts (together with special legislation relating to Scotland) and certain provisions of the Sale of Pood Order which are continued in force by the Expiring Laws Continuance Act. A further Bill (of which copy is enclosed) t dealing with the Sale of Bread was in- f See below, introduced into the House of Commons during the 1924 Session, but in view of the pressure of other Parliamentary business it .has not been possible to re-introduce it in the present Session.It appears to the Board that detailed consideration requires to he given to the question what measures, if any, should be taken for preventing short weight and measure in the retail, sale of other articles of food and drink, and they would be grateful if the Food Council could see their way to consider this matter and advise them upon it.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)      S.

ANNEX A (3).Tuesday, 1st December, 1925.*13. Captain Garro-Jones asked the President of the Board of Trade if he will state the exact terms of reference to the Pood Council on the subject of short weight.Sir Philip Cunwffe-Listeu: The Pood Council have been asked to advise what measures, if any, should be taken for preventing short weight and measure in the retail sale of articles of food and drink other than tea and bread. I understand that the evidence offered to the Food Council was such that they have been obliged to consider this subject in relation to bread also. The range which it is intended the Council should cover in their present consideration is articles of food of general consumption, including milk.ANNEX B (1;.Board oe Trade (Standards Department).REPORT UPON THE DOSS OF WEIGHT AND EVAPORATION INFOODSTUFFS.A knowledge as to the extent of the possible variation in course of time of various articles after weighing is a matter of some importance when short weight legislation is under consideration. No authentic in-formation appears to have been accessible hitherto and it was therefore suggested that experiments should be undertaken to ascertain as far as possible, within the limited period that might be available, at least the general nature and scale of the variations that might ordinarily be ex-pected. In general, evaporation would constitute the principle cause of loss in weight, but in the case of meat, loss will also arise from the escape of the juices. At the request of the Food Council, experiments were put in hand to determine the changes arising under both these heads.Evaporation Tests.Evaporation tests were made upon a considerable number of articles, such as butter, jam, sugar, cereals and various sundries. Two sets of samples were obtained, and in most cases two specimens of each article in each set. One set consisted of goods purchased in the ordinary way from three shops in the neighbourhood of this Office, which were selected as representative of various classes of trade. In each case the articles were bought over the counter, and no suspicion appeared to arise that they were required for any special purpose. The goods were sealed and weighed at this Office as received and have since been kept unopened. In no case was the gross weight less than that demanded.The second set of samples consisted almost wholly of packeted goods, and were obtained with the assistance of Inspectors of Weights and Measures, and with the co-operation of the wholesalers direct from the warehouse. Duplicate empty packages were also obtained, in order to ascertain whether they showed any variation that might have to be allowed for. The original weights in this group were taken by the Inspector, and the goods forwarded to the Department hence a few days here elapse between the first and second weighings.The samples have been kept under constant observation, being weighed at first daily, and then twice a week. As it was quickly obvious that the state of moisture of the air was an important factor in the changes taking place, readings were taken upon a hair hygrometer after the first few days. It is not, however, possible to say what was the condition of the air when the various packages were made up.
It should perhaps here be explained that &quot; dry &quot; and &quot; moist &quot; in this connection do not necessarily mean &quot;fine&quot; or &quot;wet&quot; weather respectively. At any given temperature the atmosphere can take up a certain amount of moisture, this amount increasing as the temperature rises. When this limit is reached, the air becomes saturated, and fog, not necessarily rain, tends to occur. Conditions which conduce to fog, such as a fall in temperature and still air, also conduce to a moist atmosphere, that is, a state in which the amount of moisture present is a high percentage of the maximum possible.The percentage saturation of the air may vary over a wide range, but anything outside the limits of 30 to 90 per cent., especially in enclosed premises, may be considered abnormal. The average ordinarily assumed is 66f per cent. Within the three-weeks during which readings were taken, the extreme values recorded are 47 and 86 per cent, with an average over 20 readings of 65 per cent. The driest days occur in the middle of the period, and in most of the articles tested, the maximum loss synchronises roughly with that time, a recovery then setting in. The articles purchased locally show rather a greater tendency towards a loss in weight than is observed in the second group, as the more permanent packing of the latter would lead one to expect.In considering the results which have been obtained up to the present, it should be observed that under the Weights and Measures Regulations, 1907, an ordinary counter machine of 7 lbs. capacity is required on verifi-cation to be sensitive to 2 drams. After a. period of use, it would naturally become less sensitive. Few of the articles tested would ordinarily be weighed out upon a machine of smaller capacity than 7 lb., and larger machines, which would be rather less sensitive, are often used. One per cent, upon a 1 lb. purchase is equal to, roughly, 2J drams. Similarly, automatic machines for filling packets by weight are ordinarily required to work to a margin of i per cent, upon a definite load. These factors may be regarded as fixing the scale upon which any observed change in weight is to be assessed.It is perhaps unnecessary to give in full all the weighing recorded, but the actual figures are available if required. The following summary records the behaviour of all the articles at present under observation:  A. Articles purchased locally. Period covered by these observations, January 5th to February 1st, 1926.1. Gain in weight.Packet raisins, 4 per cent.; packet green peas, 1 per cent.2. No appreciable variation (less than \ per cent.).Jam, marmalade, loaf sugar, white granulated sugar, packet suet.3. Appreciable loss (1J to 2 per cent.).Butter (now quite rancid), candied peel, raisins (loose).4. Important loss (3 to 4 per cent.).Lentils, split peas, haricot beans, dried fruit salad.In most of the above cases, loss in weight is shown during the first week and during the drier days which follow, the loss being then checked or partially recovered as the amount of moisture in the air increases. In many other instances, however, the fluctuations arising in this way are of about the same order as the maximum loss, that is, the variations which occur are largely, if not wholly, due to atmospheric changes, rather than to any progressive change in the goods themselves. The range in these cases is generally small.Thus, demerara sugar, which at one period lost J per cent, and flour and flaked oats, which lost 1 to 1J per cent., return practically to their original figure. With flaked rice, a loss of 1 per cent, becomes later a gain of j per cent. Sultanas, custard powder (loose) and packet.corn flour lose 2 per cent, and recover to 1 per cent.   A test was also made
upon sausages. A loss of about J oz. in one lb. occurred in two days increasing to I oz. to 1 oz. on the third day, by which time the articles were probably unsaleable.B. Goods obto d from the packers. Period covered by these obser-vations, January . [or in a few cases January 12th] to February 2nd, 1926.The results obtained from this group of samples were, generally speak-ing, similar to those above described. On the whole, however, where losses have occurred, they are usually appreciably smaller than those recorded in the previous group, and in several cases there is an actual gain in weight. The dummy containers tested show but small variations, which can usually be ignored. In very few instances do they exceed J dram.The period covered is substantially the same as that for the previous set of samples, but in this case the goods for part at least of the dry period previously referred to were in course of transit, and were there-fore not freely exposed.The following have, since they were first weighed by the inspector, (a) gained in weight:	Per cent.

Per cent.Haricot beans        ...     J Green peas   ...      ...    ljLentils......      ...   1-1  Dried fruit salad    ...    3C. Sundries. A further, small group of sundries, received at this office a few days later than the above, has been under observation for about 14 days, during which time the moisture in the atmosphere has been a little above, rather than below, the average. In no case has there been a loss in weight since the samples were weighed by the inspector,but gains as follows have been recorded:  Per cent. Per cent.Cornflour      ......     1-J Ground-rice ...      ...    1Dessicated cocoanut...     1 Peas    ... ...      ...    1No significant change has arisen in white pepper, Epsom salts, Spanish juice, icing sugar, baking powder.In assessing the value of these results, a number of factors have to be taken into account. In the first place, there is a limit to the time which will elapse after making up before the goods become unsaleable owing to deterioration. This limit will be smaller in the case of the samples contained in the ordinary grocers&apos; bags, which are often of a porous nature, than in those properly packed and sealed up in carton or in other more or less impervious wrappers. As an offset to the greater length of time that the latter class may be kept, it would appear, from the samples examined, that they were probably drier when put up, and also that they are less responsive to changes in atmospheric conditions.
351RThe samples tested were derived from a limited number of sources, and they were kept under similar conditions and observed over the same period. The results obtained cannot therefore be taken as representa-tive of what might occur under other and more extreme conditions  for instance, an extended -period of dry or moist weather.The conditions under which, the goods are kept, which might determine the case or otherwise with which moisture might be gained or lost, have also to be taken into account. In the above experiments, the samples were laid out singly upon a bench in a way that would not greatly hinder such changes as might tend to occur. They were kept in a room which is ordinarily in occupation. Although heated by a coal fire it can be described as a cool room.The proper investigation of the whole of the field is a matter of some complexity. The experiments are therefore being continued, in order to obtain more definite information on these outstanding points.D. Loss in weight of meat after cutting. The directions given to the Department were   .   .   .      the following cuts should be taken:  (1) 5 lbs. of thick lean out of the round of buttock.(2) 5 lbs. of the sirloin.(3) 1 lb. of. steak. In each case, cuts from imported meat and from home meat should be taken, and the meat should be cut at 4 p.m. in the evening, and weighed at noon next day.&quot;These directions were exactly followed. Each piece was cut from the carcase at about 4 p.m.. in the presence of a representative of the Department, and weighed on the spot. The imported meat had just been taken from cold storage, and was still hard frozen.Tho meat was then placed in a cool room in the basement of this office, the. temperature of which was practically steady at about 50oF. The larger pieces were hung on hooks and allowed to drip freely; the smaller pieces were laid on inclined dishes to permit of free drainage. Each sample was then re-weighed at noon next -day.The results obtained were as follows : - 	Weights when cut.			Weight at noon next day.			Loss (actual).

If in any proceedings under this Act in respect of any package of tea the defendant proves that he purchased the tea in the package in which he sold it or had it in his possession for the purposes of sale and with a written warranty of the net weight of the tea contained in the. package, and that he had no reason to believe, at the time when lie sold it or had it in his possession for tho purpose of sale, that the package did not comply with the provisions of this Act, he shall be entitled to be discharged from the prosecution.2. For the purposes of the foregoing provision, a statement on any package or any wrapper, band or label affixed thereto or delivered there-with shall be deemed to be a warranty.3. A warranty shall not be available as a defence to any proceedings under this Act unless the defendant has, within seven days after service of the summons, sent to the prosecutor a copy of such warranty with a written notice stating that he intends to rely on the warranty, and specifying the name and address of the person from whom he received it and has also sent a like notice of his intention to such person.4. The person by whom such warranty is alleged to have been given shall be entitled to appear at the hearing and to give evidence, and the court may, if it thinks fit, adjourn the hearing to enable him to do so.5. A warranty given by a person resident outside the United Kingdom shall not be available as a defence to any proceeding under this Act, unless the defendant proves that ho had taken reasonable steps to ascer-tain and did in fact believe in the accuracy of the statement contained in the warranty.6. Where the defendant is a servant of the person to whom a warranty was given, he shall, subject to the provisions hereof, be entitled to rely on the defence hereby allowed in the same way as his employer or master would have been entitled to do if he had been the defendant, provided that the servant further proves that he had no reason to believe that the package of tea did not comply with the provisions of this Act.7. Where the defendant in a prosecution under this Act has been dis-charged under the provisions of this schedule, any proceedings for giving the warranty relied on by the defendant in such prosecution may be taken as well before a court having jurisdiction in the place where the contravention of this Act took place, as before a court having juris-diction in the place where the warranty was given.8. Every person who, in respect of any tea sold by him as principal or agent, gives to the purchaser a false warranty in writing, shall be liable on summary conviction, for a first offence, to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, for a second offence to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, and for any subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds, unless he proves to the satisfaction of the court that when he gave the warranty he had reason to believe that the statements or descriptions contained therein were true.
