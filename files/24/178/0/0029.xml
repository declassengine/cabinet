DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.C A BINE T. * OT.28C26 )IRON AND STEEL. (Safeguarding of Industries. Application.) Memorandum by the President of the. Board of Trade.I have recently received a deputation from the Iron and Steel Trades Federation, which asked for an Interview with the Prime Minister.The main purpose of the deputation was to urge that applications should be entertained from sections of the steel trade, where there was a prima facie case under the Safeguarding White Paper, and where the repercunsive effect on other industries would not be such as to bring the applicants within the recent decision of the Cabinet.    The sections  which they instanced as desiring to apply were (1) Wire rods, wire, and wire netting:  (2) Joists for   constructional steel.The Federation contended that exception could not be taken to either claim on the ground of its adverse effect on other industries.    Wire and wire netting were consumers goods, and wire rods the raw material of wire only.    Joists for constructional steel could be protected without harm. So far as constructional steel was exported, it was manu-factured by firms who were themselves makers of joists^ and who would therefore welcome a duty.    So far as construc-tional steel was used for building in this country;, building was a sheltered home trado which could not reasonably object; and constructional steel was not used in working class houses..The Cabinet will remember that we decided not to entertain sectional applications, because we believed that such a course would be unfair to and would be resented by
the larger and more elementary sections of the trade. The deputation however were instructed to put forward their request for sectional treatment by the whole Federation. The reason which prompted our  decision on this aspect cf the case Is thus proved to be unsound.    I think therefore that the Board of Trade must treat a sectional application of the kind I have indicated on its merits; and that an inquiry must be granted where a prima facie case Is established,I made It clear to the deputation that there could be no question of granting an inquiry where the section was the raw material of other industries or of the re-rolling branch of their own industry.    They raised the question of wrought iron; but agreed that this was ruled out by our decision.I attach a copy of a letter I have received from the committee responsible for the original application.(Intld.) P.G-L.Board of Trade,25th January, 1926 ,
Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co.11, Ironmonger Lane, London, E.C.2.22nd January, 1926.The Sight rion&apos;ble Sir Philip Cunliffe Lister,K.B.E. ,M.C,M.P., The President of the Board of Trade, Great George Street, S.W.1.Sir,The Committee responsible for the applications from a number of sections of the Iron and Steel Trade for Committees under the Safeguarding of Industries Procedure laid down in the White Paper Cmd. 2327, have held a Joint meeting to-day and have had before them the statement of the Prime Minister made in the House of Commons On Monday, December 21st, and a report from the deputation which had the honour of waiting upon you on Thursday, the 14th instant.The Committee recorded the profound disappointmentoccasioned to  the Iron and Steel industry by the decision of thePrime Minister, particularly as they had been much encouraged to expect a different result in view of the firm determinationexpressed in his Election Address that:-&quot;We are determined to safeguard the employment and standard of living of our people in any efficient industry in which they are imperilled by unfair competition by applying the principle of the Safeguarding of Industries Act or by analogous measures&quot;.The Committee note that in view of the magnitude of the interests concerned, H.M. Government are of opinion that the introduction of Import Duties covering the whole range   of Iron and Steel, might be interpreted as a breach of the Prime Minister1b declaration with regard to a general tariff.While the Committee are not prepared to accept this view they desire me to remind H.M. Government that the pressure of Continental competition as affected by depreciated Exchanges
is crushing, and those conditions are entirely beyond the control of industry, and the responsibility for adopting measures to enable them to be effectively equalised during the period of natural adjustment, must roBt on H.M. Government.The Committee instruct me to press once more for the reconsidoration of the decision that the applications under the Safeguarding Procedure cannot be ontertained, or alternatively, that immediate steps should be taken to explore possible methods of providing employment for those workers in the industry who must become displaced unless an immediate lmprove-ment in existing conditions is effected.I am to remind you that the amount of employment represented by the Iron and Steel imports for 1925,  (2,700,000 tons), if made from British oro and coal, is upwards of 110,000 men for the whole year.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd, )av- Peat.Socretary, Iron and Steel SafeguardingCommittee.
