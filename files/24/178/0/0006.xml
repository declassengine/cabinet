SECRET,Pi 6  (26),- SoCAB I NET.PROVISIONAL PROGRAMME OF LEGISLATION (BOARD OF TRADE).Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,I wish to submit, for the consideration of the Cabinet, the following programme of legislation to be introduced by the Board of Trade in the next Session:-(Safeguarding of Ind is tries.Part I of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921, (Key Industry duties) expires on the 18th August, 19,06- It will bo necessary to renew these duties either In their present form, or with such modifications as may be recommended by the Export Committee which is now sitting.    I assume that these duties together with tho duty on wrapping paper and any other Safeguarding duties, which the Cabinet approve, will be included in the Budget Finance Bill. (2). Merohandigo Marks.The Prime Minister has already announced that a Merchandise Marks Bill will be Introduced.   A Bill Is now in draft based on the detailed recommendations of an Inter-Departmental Committeo.    The Bill will be a Joint Bill drawn up by the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Agriculture. This Bill must be Introduced in tho House of Commons.    It will bo generally popular, but a group of Liberals will oppose it. I doubt whether it will be opposed officially by the Labour Party.It will be desirable to introduce at the same time another Merchandise Marks Bill containing a number of useful amendments of the existing law which have been recommended from time to time and are long overdue.    This Bill is not ofHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.
a controversial. character, though it would lead no doutft to a good deal of discussion.    It could not be combined with iho other Bill because it would bo impossible to get so large a Bill through in a reasonable time against the opposition excited by the controversial part of a combined measure,    I should propose not to prooeed with the second Bill till the first was through, and&apos; it might even bo left over till another session.   But I think it Important to introduce the second Bill with the first in order that the complete Merchandise Marks policy of the Government may be before the House and in order to hold out tangible hopes to those who dislike or are lukowarm about the first measure but are pressing for the promised amending Act.(3). Short Weight,Weights and Measures. Bankruptcy. -I should propose that Bills on these subjects should be Introduced in the House of Lords,    None of them Is contentious * (a) The Bill dealing with short woight will be baaed on a report of the Pood Council, which I hope to rooeivo in the latter part of January.Under existing legislation to give short weight is not in itself an offence, except in the caso of coal, tea and bread. A person giving short woight or measure can only be successfully prosecuted if fraud is wilfully committed in the weighing or measuring process. Deliberate intention to defraud is difficult to prove, and the Pood Council will recommend further legislation with a view to preventing short weight and measure in the sale of all foodstuffs.Lord Bradbury will assist in piloting this Bill in the House of Lords.(b) The Bill dealing with the Weights and Measures will bring petrol pump installations within the scope of the Weight;,
2i&amp; Measures Acts,  and will also make these Acts apply-to instruments for measurement by counting and for the measuring of superficial area.    It will also remove a doubt which has arisen whether the fees allowed under the Weights and Measures Acts and the Fees (Increase) Act, 1923, for testing etc., of weighing or measuring instruments may be charged where the apparatus sub-mitted fails to pass the test. This Bill was introduced in the House of Commons last Session, and is, I think, universally demanded. It is long overdue.(c) The main object of the Bill, which is to give effect to the recommendations of the Committee on Bankruptcy,  is to deal more strictly with fraudulent bankrupts. The Bill is supported by the Commercial community. Legislation has been promised,  and I know of no opposition that is likely to be raised against the provisions of the Bill,All these Bills could conveniently be introduced in the House of Lords early in the Session, when that House will not be occupied with other business.(4) The Cinema Industry.We shall be strongly pressed to deal with the Cinema Industry, The object of any legislation in this sphere would be to secure that, after a reasonable period, a progressively increasing quota of British films should be shown. It would also be necessary to deal with block booking. If the exhibitors can agree among themselves, the Bill should not be contentious. The renters and the producers are already in agreement. I doubt, however, whether most of the exhibitors will agree, though there are indications that at the worst a large minority will, which is better than might have been expected. Legislation on this subject would have support among all parties and among a section of the Press..- It might be possible to introduce such a Bill in the House of Lords, where considerable Interest in the problem has already been shown.-3-
9 5^5^ Export Credits.Unless extended by Statute it will be impossible to grant new credits under the Export Credits scheme after the 26th Sep tember, 19 26 *A Committee, under the Chairmanship of Major Hills, is examining the question of insurance against bad debts In export tradec The Committee will report soon,. Their report may contain a recommendation to the effect that Government credit facilities should be continued in some form or other and possibly by extension and modification of the existing Export Credits scheme.If it is decided to provide Government credit facilities for export trade after September next, legislation will be necessary. The necessary provisions could be included in a Trade Facilities Bill or any other Bill dealing with the provision of credits   or guarantees. In the past the extension of export credits have been provided by the inclusion of a clause in successive Trade Facilities Acts or  under the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Acts.As far as I can ascertain, there will be strong support within our Party for all the legislation which I have indicated.(6) Company and Assurance Company Law.I have had     Committees inquiring into these subjects and I expect their reports at an early date.  I should propose to postpone legislation, however, until 1927.(7) A number of agricultural members and local authorities on the sea coast have been pressing ?or a Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Coast Erosion, If time- * permits, this Bill might be introduced in the House of Lords,(Intld. )     P ,C -L .Board of Trade,5th January, 1926,-4-
