OONFIDENTlA.?., LIBRARYTHIS DOCUftiENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT.SSOBET 3 UCP. 96(26)0 A B I NET SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES WORSTED.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate the Report of the Committee appointed underthe Safeguarding of Industries procedure to consider anapplication in respect of Worsted Tissues and Fabrics.Para. 17. The Committee find that the Industry is of substantialimportancej    that foreign goods are being imported intoPara. 30. and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom inabnormal quantities;      and that the price at which suchPara. 37. goods are being imported is below the price at whichsimilar goods can be manufactured in the United Kingdom.Paras. 48 They find, however, that unemployment is not at present&amp; 78.seriously affeoted by the foreign importations; butthey express considerable anxiety as to the probability of increasing importation and its effect on employment.Paras. 49       On this they report as follows?-ai 50.In this connection we view with considerable apprehension the large increase in imports of foreign manufacture as revealed by the figures appearing in para-graph 37 of this Report and point out that in five years the retained imports have risen from approximately 3,000,000 square yards in 1921 to nearly 30,000,000 square yards in 1925.    There is nothing we have been able to discover which suggests that the volume of foreign importation is likely to diminish in future.    Assisted by the falling exchange, French manufacturers are in a position
to continue to export to this country large and increasing quantities, and although it is not possible to forecast the exact course of events, the inference seems incontestable that during, the near future and until the French exchange becomes stabilised, the advantage of a falling exchange will lie with the French manufacturer, with the result that the progressive inorease in the volume of imports of French goods into the United Kingdom may reasonably be expected to continue.    In these circumstances, we consider that within the immediate future, importation may reaoh such a magnitude as to exert a seriously adverse effect upon employment in this Industry.Me therefore consider that should importation continue to increase in a volume such as is indicated by the experience of recent years such importation may exert a seriously adverse effect upon employment in the industry.The Committee find as a faot that the present competition  Is unfair owing to the depreciation of French currency operating so as to create an export bounty.As regards inferior conditions of employment,  the Committee find that the applicants have failed to establish Inferior conditions of pay or hours.    It 1b not easy to see how they arrive at this conclusion. There is no doubt that the pay of French workers is very muoh below the English standard, and a certain amount of overtime is worked without extra pay.    The Committee, however,  take the evidence of certain trade union witnesses, who said that from their inquiries they were satisfied that internally the franc was worth 6d-. as against 3-Jd. externally, and that therefore the purchasing power in franos of the
wages of textile operators was not inferior to the purchasing power of the wages of textile operators in England.    I should find it difficult to defend this conclusion If 1 were forced to do so.    1 do not believe that the internal purchasing power of the franc is anything like twice as great as its external purchasing power.    But even if this were true, what yon have to take into account, it seems to me, is whether wage cost is so much less in a foreign country as to afford serious handicap to the British industry.However, in view of the finding that employment is not at present seriously affected, i do not think that we should be justified in proposing a duty in the forthcoming 3udget. (d) The Committee recommend that the progress of theIndustry should be carefully watched, regard being had to depreciation of foreign currencies, volume of retained imports, and employment in the industry.IjPara.78 (e) They recommend that, if seriously increased unemploymentarises in the industry from a substantial increase of the volume of retained imports, accompanied by an increase in the bounty obtained by foreign manufacturers as a result of further currency depreciation, a duty of 12-g- per cent.    should be put upon cloth and upon clothing made therefrom.    I propose, therefore, with the assistance of the Customs and the Ministry of -Labour, to watch the progress o&apos;f imports and of unemployment.      It should be comparatively simple to keep the table in Appendix A up to date, and to obtain a sufficiently accurate review of the unemployment position    Should unemployment become worse and imports increase, I will bring the matter before the Cabinet again.Para * 78
r* p oI think it will be necessary to publish the Report, and I propose that it should be published,  together with any others that are ready, about the time of the introduction of the Budget.(Intld.)      P.O-L.Board of Trade,5th March,  1926.
BOARD     OP     TRADE.SAFEGUARDING      OF      INDUSTRIES.REPORT      OFWORSTED      COMMITTEE.
BOARD      OP      TRADEThis fourteenth day of October,  1925.The Board of Trade are hereby pleased to appoint the following lady and gentlemen to be a Committee to enquire into and report upon the application made by the Bradford and District Manufacturers&apos;   Federation, the Keighley and District Manufacturers&apos; Federation and the Textile Commission Manufacturers&apos; Association in accordance with the terms of the White Paper relating to Procedure and Enquiries in connection with the Safeguarding of Industries, presented to Parliament on 3rd February, 1925, for the imposition of a duty Upon tissues or fabrics (whether in the piece or in any other form) of any weight from 2 ozs. per square yard up to and including 11 ozs. per square yard, made wholly or partly from wool or hair:-Sir Arthur Whinney, K.B.E.,  (Chairman) Dame Helen Gwynne-Vaughan, D.B.E. Mr. Ernest Bevin.The Board of Trade are  further pleased to appoint Capt. S.E.J. Brady, M.B.E., to be Secretary to the Committee.(Signed)P.  CUNLIFFE-LISTER.
Sir,We were appointed on the 14th October, 1925, to be a Committee to enquire into an application for the imposition of a duty upon tissues or fabrics (whether in the piece or in any other form) of any weight from 2 ozs. per? square yard up to and including 11 ozs. per square yard made wholly or partly from wool or hair.We have held 19 meetings and received evidence from 43 witnesses.    In addition, we have received a memorandum from the Huddersfield Chamber of Commerce on the question of the tariff treatment by foreign countries of woollen and worsted tissues containing a small proportion of silk.   We did not consider it necessary to request the Chamber to supplement their -memorandum by oral evidence.We are indebted to the Statistical Department of the Board of Trade for the preparation of tables showing the retained imports of the materials within the scope of our enquiry, and also to the Ministry of Labour for information on unemployment in the woollen and worsted industry.The   Applicants were the Bradford and District Manufacturers&apos; Federation,  the Keighley and District Manufacturers&apos; Federation and the Textile Commission Manufacturers1 Association.      The evidence showed that out of a total number of approximately 30,000 looms in Bradford and District, members of these Associations controlled 24,063. A ballot had been taken to ascertain the views of their members upon the question of an application for a duty with the following result:The Right Honourable Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, K.B.E, M.C, M.P., President of the Board of Trade.

In addition, the Chairman of the Executive Council cf the London Employers&apos; Association and of the Wholesale Mantle and Costume Manufacturers&apos; Federation gave evidence on behalf of these organisations supporting the claim for a duty, with the modification that a duty at the maximum rate should be imposed on all garments made from the cloth under reference.5. The application was opposed by a Group Committee of the textile Trade Section of the London Chamber of Commerce representing merchants, importers, wholesalers and distributors.    It was made clear to us that the Group Committee in no way represented the London Chamber of Commerce.    Three cloth manufacturers and two garment makers joined with the Opponents and gave evidence.6. The National Association of Unions in the Textile trade also opposed the application for a duty on behalf of the workpeople engaged in the Industry.    A private individual appeared and claimed to present the case on behalf of consumers who, he said, would oppose the proposed duty for the reason that any duty would increase the cost of clothing and so cause unemployment.7- A retired French manufacturer also gave evidence on the
relative cost of manufacture of single and double warp fabric .in Prance, and conditions generally in Roubaix.No large manufacturing firm outside or inside theApplicant Associations appeared before us to give evidence in opposition to the application.9.Both sides were represented by Counsel, Mr. Alexander Neilson, K.C., and Mr. J. Willoughby Jardine, appearing on behalf of the Applicants, and Mr. Cyril Atkinson, K.C, M.Pand Mr. C.p. Entwistle on behalf of the Opponents.10.During the early stages of the Enquiry it became evidentthat the definition by the Applicants of the goods on which they desired a duty to be imposed was too wide in that it covered many items which were apparently outside the scope of the application.    They,  therefore, excluded felts, rags and knitted goods, and subsequently amended their definition to read as follows:-    &quot;All dyed or undyed imported tissues or &quot;fabrics manufactured from warp and weft in a weaving loom &quot;(whether in the piece or in any other form) and made wholly &apos;br   partly from wool or hair, of any weight from 2 ozs. per &quot;square yard up to and including 11 ozs. per square yard, but &quot;excluding felts, rags and tailors&apos; clippings&quot;.11. The Applicants stated that the worsted industry was originally established in East Anglia in the fourteenth century and went North over 100 years ago and settled in the West Riding of Yorkshire.    It has since developed to such an extent that Bradford and District has become universally identified with the&apos; highest grades of worsted fabrics.12. The Applicants claimed in substance that foreign fabricsare being sold or offered for Bale in the United Kingdom at prioes which are below those at which similar goods can profitably T*e manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom and
indeed they sought to demonstrate the.t foreign prices were lower than the prime cost of manufacture in Bradford. Although the volume of imports since 1913 has declined,  the Applicants maintained that the imports to-day are of a different character from those in 1913, and that competition in fabrics hitherto considered typically British is new much more severe.    They added that the volume of trade was less than before the war so that the imports only intensified competition.     This competition,  they contended, was mainly from countries whose manufacturers, aided by depreciating currencies, were able to undercut manufacturers in- the United Kingdom,     In their view, a duty on imported fabrics would have no adverse effect on employment in any other industry.     !-; itnesses representing the making-up industry supported this view,  provided that the imposition of the duty were extended to made-up garments. 13. The Opponents maintained the.t many of the importedfabrics could not be regarded as being of the same class or description as those produced in Bradford;    that French manufacturers used cheaper wool and employed different methods from those obtaining in Bradford and that thereby they were enabled to produce more cheaply.    They further stated that if Bradford were suffering from unemployment it was   due to the fall in the export trade and not to the volume of retained imports.   Fith regard to the - difference in price,  the Opponents &apos; asserted that combing and dyeing charges are too high in Bradford and that if such charges were reduced Bradford manufacturers could compete successfully with foreign manufacturers.    It was the contention of the Opponents that many classes of imported oloths are sold on account of novelty or fancy effect in which they considered that the
- ^ 7 rrContinental manufacturers were superior.     They admitted,however,  that. Bradford manufacturers are pre-eminent in the types of goods in which they specialise.14. We now pass to a consideration of the questions uponwhich we are asked to report as laid down in the Instructionsto Committees in Section II of the White Paper Cmd, 2327.(1), WHETHER THE APPLICANT INDUSTRY IS,  BY REASON OP THEl VOLUME OP EMPLOYMENT ENGAGED IN THE PRODUCTION OP THE GOODS TO V-HICH THE APPLICATION RELATES,  OR BY REASON OP THE NATURE OP THE GOODS PRODUCED, AN INDUSTRY OP SUBSTANTIAL IMPORTANCE.15, The Applicants contended that the worsted manufacturing industry is of substantial importance, not only on account ofthe numbers employed, but also by reason of the nature of thegoods produced.In support of their case, they drew attention to the faotthat according to the 1921 Census the number of workpeopleemployed in the worsted manufacturing section of the wool textile industry in Bradford, Halifax, Shipley andKeighley amounted to 28,061 of whom 18,838 were in Bradford,in which district there are approximately 30,000 looms inexistence *16. The Opponents at first did not challenge the importanceof the Applicant Industry, but upon the representatives of the Trade Unions appearing and asserting that the workpeople in the industry had not been consulted,  the Opponents changed their position and claimed that the Applicants could not therefore be deemed to be an industry within the meaning of the White Paper,     They further asserted that in the production of fabrios there are other processes besides weaving, such as combing,  spinning and dyeing, and that inasmuch as the Applicants were only concerned with the weaving prooess, they could not be regarded as being entitled to speak for the industry as a whole.
17. We do not attach undue importance to these aspects tothe Opponents1 case.     In our view it has been proved that the Industry is of substantial Importance, by reasonof the volume of employment and of the nature of thegoods produoedo(2) WHETHER   FOREIGN GOODS OF THE GLASS OR DESCRIPTION TO WHICH THE APPLICATION RELATES ARE BEING IMPORTED INTO AND RETAINED FOR CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IN ABNORMAL QUANTITIES .18. It was suggested by the Opponents that it is notpossible to determine what may be considered to be abnormal without deciding in the first instanoe what is normal and we were invited to contrast the retained imports in 1913 (being the last pre-war year) with those of 1924 and to draw the deduction that the retained Imports In the latter year as compared with 1913 were not abnormal.19. An initial   difficulty arose from the fact that theretained imports in 1913, as given in the Trade Returns of the United Kingdom,  relate to linear yards, whereas those of 1924 are calculated in square yards, and also because the classifioa-tion has been amended so as to make comparison almost impossible.   To overcome the difficulty as to yardage it was suggested by the Applicants,  and concurred in by the Opponents, that one quarter should be added to the linear yardage of 1913 in order to express the same in square yards.   Adopting this formula the Trade Returns show that in 1913 the retained imports amounted to approximately 70,000,000 square yards as against about 22,000,000 square yards in 1924.   It,  therefore, followed in the view of the Opponents that the retained imports of 1924 were not only in no sense abnormal in quantity but were in fact considerably less than those of 1913.20&quot; A further aspect of the Opponents&apos;  case was that theindustry is now suffering from bad trade in consequence of the reduced capacity throughout the world to purchase.-f\...
goods of tho class or description to which the application relates.   Moreover, owing to change of fashion,  about half the quantity of cloth used in 1913 is required nowadays to make a woman&apos;s dress,  and therefore this particular industry is hit by an enormously reduced demand for its goods. In addition,  competition is being experienced from knitted garments of wool and artificial silk, as the great development of trade in these goods in recent years has tended to reduce the demand for woven materials suoh as are produced by the Applicant Industry. 21. The Opponents further urged that the industry issuffering more from reduced exports than retained imports and that the retained imports are trifling as compared with our exports of similar goods.    In support of this contention, they produced a table compiled from the official Trade Returns of the United Kingdom for the years 1922 to 1925 relating to the retained Imports and the Exports of British manufacture of woollen and worsted tissues under 12 ozs. per sq. yd.  so far as can be ascertained,  which may be summarised as follows:-Retained Imports.      U.K. Exports. Sq.Yds. Sq.  yds.1922............. 6,663,799 151,535,2001923............. 12,393,220 176,856,9001924............. 21,757,176 184,999,4001925;............ 29,765,690 155,266,800(Details of these figures will be found in Appendix &quot;AR)5The Opponents pointed out that these figures go to showthat the imports are insignificant when compared with the volumeof the export trade of the United Kingdom.82. Attention was drawn by the Opponents to the fact that exports of worsted tissues have been decreasing for many years,but that Woollen exports had shown a tendency to increase, andtherefore they desired us to draw the inference that the present condition of Bradford trade is not due to abnormal retained imports.
The Applicants claimed that the quantity of goods imported inAS1913 contained a large variety of oloths which are no longer imported, these having gone out of fashion, such as delaines, armures and certain oashmeroa and merinos, and they sought to show that by deducting the yardage - of these classes the comparable figures of retained imports in 1913 was reduced from 56,000,000 linear yards to 10,000,000 linear yards, and, that the latter figure only, represented the measure of competition in 1913. At a maximum this would represent 15,000,000 sq. yards against about 22,000,000 sq. yards imported in 1924.The evidence was in very considerable conflict and we do not consider that the intentions of the instructions contained in the White Paper require us to decide the question of abnormality of imports upon a comparison of goods imported in 1913 which had become unfashionable by 1924.    Conditions of fashion and consumption have materially changed sinoo 1913 and such changes necessarily affect the value of any deduction whioh.., might be drawn if that year were taken as the standard of normality.   Moreover, there is nothing in the White Paper whioh suggests that we should be so bound, and it appears to us to be more reasonable to determine the question upon data relating to a less remote period. It may be claimed that oven at present the normal conditions of trade have not yet been reached, and that normality will only arise at some future date when the world has recovered from the effects of the war. We consider we have to deal with matters as they are known to exist and not upon a hypothetical assumption as to what may happen years hence.The applicants claimed that if goods are imported into this country at a time when they could be made by our own workpeople who were unemployed in consequence, then these imports are abnormal.      They further asserted that the object
of the White Paper is to relieve unemployment, hence abnormal imports and unemployment are inter-dependent, i.e. that imports are abnormal when their volume is sufficient to cause diminution of employment.26. We do not regard as of first rate importance the evidenceput forward with the object of showing that many of the types of goods imported have gone out of fashion and have been replaced by others, we have to judge what imports are in competition with British manufaotured goods as a v/hole, and not with the individual varieties which fashion from time to time dictates. It is clear, that in the main, any type of cloth of the kind with which we are concerned can readily be substituted, as the demand arises, for another.27. We therefore base our conclusions upon the figures ofretained imports as disclosed by the Trade Returns of the United Kingdom from 1920 to 1925.    The retained Imports of woollen and worsted tissues under 12 ozs. per sq. yd, so far as oan be ascertained were19S0 j e o c s e 1921 * 9 a o ft a1922 0   o  ft  o 0  b1923 o a o *. v o 132*4* c 9 * o * o1Q25 o  0 s 9 9 91,918,988 sq. yds, 2,962,663    &quot;      w 6,653,799    &quot;      &quot; 12,593,220    &quot;      &quot; 21,757,176    &quot;      &quot; 29,765,690    &quot;      &quot;Imports under 11 ozs. are not separately given in the Trade Returns.   The above figures probably also include a small amount of cloth over 12 oz. such as tapestries and damasks, but the quantity of material imported in this category is comparatively small and can be disregarded.    These figures reveal not only a continuous increase in the retained imports but one which has been sustained during the whole period of six years.^Details of these imports will be found in Appendix &quot;A&quot; together with corresponding United Kingdom exports.
In 1920 the French manufacturers (who supplied over 80 per cent, of the imports of woollen tissues under 12 ^zs. during each of the years 1922 to 1924) had not themselves re-established their industry after the war.    This fact, however, does not detract from the severity of the competition as disclosed by the figures between the years 1922 and 1925, which show that during this period alone, the imports retained for consumption in the United Kingdom - mainly from France - have inoreased nearly fivefold.The imports of apparel show a similar upward tendency. A comparison with 1913 is not possible, as the classification has changed, but the Trade Returns for 1921 to 1925 show that the retained imports of women&apos;s and girls&apos; garments of woven fabrics:- costumes, dresses, coats, skirts and the like, were as under:-&amp;1921............    1,140,4891922............    1,588,6661923............-    2,424,3871924............    3*655,5571925........... .    3,582,464It does not follow, however, that all these articles of apparel are made from materials within the terms of our reference,  as the goods are not subdivided in the Trade Returns according to the nature of the materials from which they are made. The slight decrease In the figures in 1925 is no doubt accounted for by the imposition of the silk duty from July the 1st of that year.With regard to the Opponents&apos; contentions that imports are insignificant when compared with export trade,  and that exports have been diminishing during recent years, we observe that the volume of retained imports during the last few yearsshows an ever inoreasing ratio when compared with the figuresof British Export Trade, thus,in 1922 the retained imports were 4.4$ of the export trade.&quot;  1923    &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7.0%    &quot;      &quot;        &quot; &quot;&quot; 1924    n &quot; &quot; &quot; 11.836    &quot;      &quot;        &quot; &quot;n  1925 &quot; &quot; 19.2%    &quot;      &quot;        &quot; &quot;
From these figures it is evident that the volume of retained imports when compared with the volume of exports is advancing in an ever increasing ratio, which if continued will not be without serious effect on British Industry.We therefore find that Foreign Goods of the class or description to which the Application relates are being imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in abnormal quantities.(3) WHETHER THE FOREIGN GOODS SO IMPORTED ARE BEING SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AT PRICES WHICH ARE BELOW THE PRICES AT WHICH SIMILAR GOODS CAN BE PROFITABLY MANUFACTURED OR PRODUCED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.In the course of the enquiry it became evident,    that inthe main, foreign goods are produced by processes whichdiffer from those in operation in the United Kingdom, and that not only do the processes of manufacture differ in each centrebut a lower grade of wool is largely used by Continentalmanufacturers who produce principally single warp fabricsas against double warp fabrics in which Bradford manufacturersspecialise.It transpired in evidence that the selling price of foreign goods was lower than that of British, but that their durability is inferior.    Furthermore,  it was clear from the evidence of the technical witnesses that it is a matter of considerable difficulty to   distinguish single warp from double warp fabrics except by a process of disintegration.While we recognise that the processes of production differ we consider that for the purpose of the enquiry the products may properly be regarded as similar, in the sense that, whether made from single or double warp,  the   ultimate commodities are in competition:- they are in fact indistinguishable by the consumer.
34. The Applicants sought to prove that the prime cost ofgoods manufactured in Bradford is higher than the selling price of comparable foreign goods in this country.    They submitted to us 17 samples, mainly of women&apos;s dress materials, which they claimed to be fully representative of the existing bulk trade.    Certified costings were furnished In support of their contention.    Important merchants who claimed to be in continual and close contact with English and French markets also appeared and gave evidence as to the extent to which Bradford Is undersold by the foreigner.    Evidence regarding costs and selling prices was also given in camera.35. From the data submitted It was established that on someclasses of material Bradford manufacturers are undersold by as .much as from 15 to 20$,    In addition, it was demonstrated that the difference In prices was widened in cases where purchases were made in francs and the settlement effected some months later on a falling exchange.36. The Opponents urged that, apart from the difference Inthe methods of manufacture, the cost of combing and dyeing in Bradford and District is excessive and tends unduly to increase the price of the finished article In the United Kingdom.    The Applicants agreed that combing and dyeing charges are high, but furnished data to demonstrate that the ratio of these charges to prime cost in 1924 showed but little increase over that obtaining In 1914.    Nevertheless the evidence submitted by the Opponents showed that these charges press unduly on the Industry at the present time, and are having an adverse effect upon the cost of production of the finished article, thus indirectly influencing the volume of imports from abroad.   We take the view, however, that it is not possible in considering the subject of this enquiry, to take into account the costs of those processes which are beyond the control of the Applicant Industry.
In. our opinion the Applicants have proved their contention that foreign goods are being sold or offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices which are below the prices at which similar ^opds can be Profitably manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom.Certain factors which conduce to the lower price of the imported commodities are more particularly dealt with underHeadings 5 and 6.    (paras. 51 to 68.)(4) WHETHER, BY REASON OF THE SEVERITY AND EXTENT OF SUCH COMPETITION, EMPLOYMENT IN THE MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION OF SUCH GOODS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IS BEING, OR IS LIKELY TO BE, SERIOUSLY AFFECTED.In the presentation of their case the Applicants relied upon evidence of the number of idle looms and of the fact thata number of workpeople are working half time.   They statedthat they had ascertained from the members of theirAssociations the following particulars as to the number ofidle looms:-Week-ending. Fullr time. Idle.     Short time.31st January,  1925. 55.1$ 35.7$ 9.2$9th May,  1925. 43.4$ 39$ 17.6$31st October,  1925. 53.0$ 39.5$ 7.5$Several witnesses gave evidence as to the number of Idlelooms and one large manufacturer owning 732 looms gave his experience as followsYear. Percentage of Idle Looms.1923 15$1924 30$192.5 33$Another witness, being a member of a firm possessing 600 loomsIn 1913, stated that his firm now has 317 looms of which only28 are running.   A third witness possessing in 1919, 383 looms,
of which 65.8$ were then working, stated that he now has only 3-18 looms of which 87.3$ only are working. Evidence to a similar effect was given by other manufacturers.39. This evidence was supported by that of certain merchants ina large way of business. One firm which in 1913 purchased 5$ of its requirements from abroad, now purchase about 60$ of -foreign goods. A member of another firm which before the war purchased 90$ of its requirements from Bradford and lofo from abroad, stated that during the last two years his firm has purchased the whole of its requirements from abroad. Corroborative evidence of this nature was given by several witnesses, the effect of which was that foreign made goods are purchased on account of price and not on account of quality or nature.40. The Opponents endeavoured to prove&apos; that the number ofidle looms was largely due to the change of fashion from gabardines to poplins and repps, and gave evidence to the effect that a weaver can produce at least three pieces of poplin in the same time as that taken to weave two pioces of gabardine.Another reason put forward by the Opponents to explain the number of idle looms was that the number of operatives in the woollen and worsted industry had diminished from 273,330 in June, 1924, to 257,700 in October, 1925.    These figures relate to the woollen and worsted industry as a whole and the Opponents were unable to state the numbers which had left the worsted industry in particular.    The Opponents further stated that the amount of unemployment in the woollen and worsted industry was low as compared with that in other industries, being only 10.8$ in October, 1925, as
oompared with an average of 11.4$ for all industries^-.    The Opponents further pointed out that the Applicants were weavers and that there was little or no unemployment among that section of the Industry, and that such unemployment as exists arises mainly from the fact that the change in fashion from gabardine to poplin requires fewer vreavers and other operatives. They pointed out that according to the Returns of the Ministry of Labour in November 1925, there were only 64 men and 297 women worsted weavers unemployed in Bradford, 2 men and 276 women in Huddersfield, 6 men and 50 women in Keighley and 4 men and 20 women in Halifax. 41, They claimed that these figures show that unemploymentin the worsted industry is comparatively small, and submitted that far from unemployment arising from the Importation of similar goods, it was brought about by the change in fashion and by the competition arising from the use of knitted garments of wool and artificial silk. 42. Representatives from the Trade Unions connected with theIndustry also gave evidence to the effect that there had always been fluctuations in employment, and that whereas the worsted section of. the industry is sometimes   well employed, and the woollen section depressed,  the reverse is frequently the case, and they stated that unemployment at the present time is worse in the heavy woollen section than in the worsted section. They further expressed the view that if the whole of the foreign goods now imported into the United Kingdom were manufactured in this country, it would not place on full time all those workers who are at present on short time.*-The Ministry of Labour Gazette for January 1926, gives the percentage of unemployment amongst insured workers in the woollen and worsted industries as 8.8$ as against the average for all Industries of 10.5$.
43. The Trade Union Representatives further asserted that unemployment is closely connected with fluctuations in the price of wool, and pointed out that during 1924 the price of wool rose considerably, while during the early part of 1925 a fall in price took place, with the consequence that buyers having no confidence in the market placed comparatively small orders for piece goods,  thus affecting employment In the weaving industry.    They pointed out that the price of raw wool during the past two or three months had been more or less stable, with the result that orders for piece goods had begun to flow in again as indicated by the reduction in recent unemployment figures.44. In support of their evidence as to the small amount- ofunemployment in Bradford, the Trade Union Officials stated that during the past three years they had only disbursed  438,000 In unemployment pay (including the State payment) to the 52,000 persons whom they represent.45. They put forward the view that if employment in theworsted Industry is to be safeguarded,  it should be done by control of the world&apos;s prices of wool, either by G-overn-ment buying or co-operation between manufacturers.46. We endeavoured to arrive at a close approximation of thefacts relating to unemployment by enquiry from&apos;the Statistical Department of the Ministry of Labour,  to which Department we are indebted for their assistance.    From this source we learned that the total number of operatives in the woollen and worsted industry in October,  1925, was 257,700 of whom 10.8$ were unemployed.    The Ministry, however, pointed out that their figures do not  take into account operatives working short time, and that this would probably have the effect of increasing the figures by about 4 or 5$.    They stated that the figures also did not include stoppages for one or two days a week, and did not take into account the
fact that weavers who ordinarily-attend two looms aweek, may now in many cases be operating one loom only.The Ministry added that some of the looms referred to bythe Applicants were probably idle on account of the reductionof workers in the industry which has taken place during thelast few years.The- Ministry submitted figures relating to the number of applicants for employment as Worsted Weavers at the Bradford Employment Exchanges, as follows:-In December,  1924 &apos; ...      43 men and      167 women483      &quot;&quot; May, 1935 .. . 7S if&quot; June, 1935 ... 110 &quot;* July, 1925 ... 157 &quot;&quot; October, 1925 ... 73 &quot;&quot; November, 1925 ... 64 &quot;804 &quot;1,135 &quot;654 &quot;297 &quot;w December,  1935    ...      55    &quot;      *        192      M It should be remarked that according to the witnesses for the Applicants, the diminution of unemployment during October and November, 1925 was due to the fact that there had been a stoppage in the industry in Auguat and that manufacturers were now working to catch up arrears.The inadequacy of the data furnished by the Applicants on whom the onus of proof lies has not tended to diminish the difficulties we have experienced in reconciling the evidence submitted on the subject of unemployment in the Applicant Industry.    With the objeot of further elucidating the matter and bearing in mind that wages mean employment, we called upon both sides to supply us with an estimate of the wages which would be paid in the United Kingdom if all the retained imports in 1924 had been manufactured here. The estimates produced showed a wide variation. The evidence of the Applicants indicated a total of  311,000 while that of the
Opponents showed a comparable figure of upwards of  130,000; both sides, however, purported to deal only with wages In the weaving industry.    It is clear, however, that if wages which would have been disbursed in connection with other processes, such as combing, spinning and dyeing, were taken into account, the above mentioned figures would be very considerably increased.48. We have arrived at the conclusion that unemployment isnot at present seriously affected by the importation of foreign competitive good3.49. The conclusion of the Committee Is, however, not to be confined only to the state of affairs as It exists at present. By the instructions contained in the White Paper, the duty Is placed upon us of forming an opinion as to whether employment is likely to be affected In the future by the importation of foreign goods.    In this connection we view with considerable apprehension the large increase in imports of foreign manufac-ture as revealed by the figures appearing in paragraph 27 of this Report and point out that in five years the retained imports have risen from approximately 3,000,000 square yards in 1921 to nearly 30,000,000 square yards In 1925.    There is nothing we have been able to discover which suggests that the volume of foreign importation is likely to diminish in future.    Assisted by the falling exchange, French manufac-turers are in a position to continue to export to this country large and increasing quantities, and although it is not possible to forecast the exact course of events, tho inference seems incontestable that during the near future and until the French exchange becomes stabilised, the advantage of a falling exchange will lie with the French manufacturer, with the result that the progressive increase in the volume of imports of French goods into the United
- Kingdom may reasonably bo expected to continue.    In these- circumstances&apos;, we consider that within the immediate future, importation may reach such a magnitude as to exert a seriously adverse effect upon employment in this Industry.5o. We therefore consider that should importation continueto increase in a volume such as is. indicated by the ..experience of recent years such importation may exert aseriously adverse effect upon employment in the industry.(5) WHETHER SUCH EXCEPTIONAL COMPETITION COMES largely from COUNTRIES WHERE THE CONDITIONS ARE SO DIFFERENT FROM THOSE  IN THIS COUNTRY AS TO RENDER THE COMPETITION UNFAIR.- Competition for the purpose of such enquiry is nottobe deemed to be unfair unless it arises from one or more ofthe following causes:(a) Depreciation of currency operating so as to create an export bounty.&quot;(b) Subs id ie s, bounties.,  or other artificial advantages .(c) Inferior conditions of employment of labour, whether as &quot;respects remuneration or hours of empToyment, or otherwise,.&quot; obtaining amongst the persons employed in the produotion of the imported &quot;goods in question as compared with those obtaining amongst persons employed&quot; in the production of simlfar goods in the United Kingdom.51. With the exception of a comparatively small quantityof fabrics imported from Italy, Belgium and Germany, competition with British Manufacturers comes from France and it is therefore necessary to consider the conditions which exist in that country under the three sub-heads prescribed by the white Paper.52. With regard to sub-head (a) the Applicants contended thatthe competition which they are at present experiencing from France arises from the effect of the depreciating currency of that country which operates so as to create an export bounty. They pointed out that the franc has been steadily depreciating during the past few years and in consequence competition has
become intensified.    They emphasised that tlie difference in selling prices is accounted for not only by the relatively lower wages-of. the French weavers owing to the depreciating franc, but that such lower wages have their effect on every article used by French manufacturers and therefore apply to every operation in the industry such as combing,  spinning and dyeing. The cumulative effect of the relatively lower wages in every process and in the cost of all stores which are used in the oouvbq of manufacture is therefore considerable.    The Applicants also pointed out that British manufacturers are handicapped by the relatively higher cost of social services. One witness who employs 1,400 persons submitted his figures to prove that as compared with 1913 the cost of National Health and Unemployment Insuranoe has increased by over three times that of 1913,  and that Rates and Taxes are much higher and also that the cost of Insurance for Workmen&apos;s Compensation has increased. 53. We consider it was demonstrated that the foreignmanufacturer derives an advantage from the relatively lower wages which he pays by reason of the fact that the interna purchasing power of the franc exceeds its external value. We agree with the Applicants that the difforence in wages applies to every process in the worsted manufacturing industry. It is clear, however,  that as foreign manufacturers buy their wool in the world&apos;s markets they are under a disadvantage in respect of the purchase of raw materials in so far as these have to be paid for in foreign currency,  and it is even conceivable that the French currency may eventually suffer a degree of depreciation which will countervail tho advantage the French manufacturer derives from the relativelyoheaper coat of labour.     The evidence of a prominent merchant strongly oupporte
the applicants   contention as regards the bounty which is conferred by the depreciating currency.    This witness stated that in June 1924 he made oontraots in francs when the frano stood at 82 to the &amp;, but that he covered his commitments by purchasing francs at various rates up to 116 to the  , and thus, cloth which cost about 20 francs, equivalent to 4/7^-d. per metre when he placed his order,  actually cost him 3/ll-d. This difference in price was entirely due to the depreciating exchange.    Further evidence of this nature was received in camera in support of the Applicants&apos; contention that owing to the depreciation of the franc,  the cost of French cloth in sterling was considerably reduced between the date of order and delivery. 54. The Opponents contended that the bounty depends on aoontinuing depreciation of French currency and suggested that if the franc appreciated the French manufacturer would be adversely affected.55. We are of opinion that competition is unfair owing to the depreciation of the French currency operating so as to create an export bounty.56. With regard to sub-head (b), we received no evidence as tosubsidies, bounties or artificial advantages,  other than that referred to under sub-head (a).57. With regard to sub-head (c), the Applicants sought to prove that wages in France, Belgium, Italy and Germany are very much lower than in the United Kingdom.    They also stated that overtime in England commences after 48 hours per week but only after 53 or 54 on the Continent.58. The evidence of the Opponents as regards Germany was directed to show that their currency had been stabilised for two years, that the Bank Rate in Berlin was 13 to 14% on loans fully secured and that the Berlin rate of discount was 9% against the
London rate of 4?o.    They, therefore, pointed out that German manufacturers, are handicapped and certainly enjoyed noadvantages over their British competitors.-59. With respect to Prance, the representatives of theNational Association of Unions in the Textile Trade stated in evidence that a deputation had recently visited Prance in connection with an enquiry into wages,    They stated that French wages, according to the grade of worker have risen to approximately from five to seven times what they were before the war, and in addition that the French worker receives family allowances as well as sickness and surgical benefits. They stated that the French worker also receives 15% to 20fo extra wages for increased production, and that the working hours have fallen from 60 per week, pre-war, to 48 per week at the present time, whereas British hours of labour had only been reduced from 55-g- to 48 hours per week.    Nevertheless, the deputation pointed out that French workers receive no increase of hourly rate of pay up to 53 hours, whereas the overtime rate of pay in the United Kingdom is rate and a quarter for all hours over 48 per week. They stated, however, that the weavers in both countries worked the same number of hours, that is 48 hours per week. These Trade Union witnesses were satisfied from actual enquiry made in France, that the franc is internally worth 6d. as against 2^-d. externally, and that the present purchasing power of the wages earned by French textile workers is in excess of that obtained by British operatives.    In these circumstances, they urged that there were no inferior conditions of labour in France.60. The Applicants endeavoured to meet this point by statingthat although French wages may have increased 5 to 7 times over the pre-war rates, yet in order to equal the increased British wages, corrected by the fall in exchange, and taking
into account reduced hours, the French wages should have increased 9 times with the franc at 100.88 to the   or lOf times with the franc at 121 to the  , from which fact they dedu.ced that relatively the French worker is not now as well off as the British worker ?/hen viewed in the light of the falling French currency.61. As against this it has to be borne in mind that accordingto the evidence of the Trade Union representatives, the internal purchasing power of the franc is worth 6d. as compared with the value of 2-g-d.  externally.    Moreover, the Trade Union officials, discounting the value of calculations of exchange, came to the conclusion as the result of personal enquiry and inspection that the purchasing capacity of the wages of French textile workers is considerably in excess of those of their British confreres.62. Having regard to the evidence adduced before us, we areof opinion that^ the Applicants haye^ failed to establish inferior oqnditionsi of employment of labour either as regards remuneration or hours of _em.pl oyjaenjt.63. We- are asked in the White Paper, when dealing with thisquestion, to call attention to any special circumstances by reason of ?/hich the industry in the United Kingdom is placed at a serious relative disadvantage.    From the evidence given before us it   is clear, that, as Paris is admittedly the centre for women&apos;s fashions, French manufacturers have a decided advantage over British manufacturers in being able to keep in closer contact with the French Model Houses. These houses produce new fashions and French manufacturers are thus able to secure a start over British manufacturers in reproducing fabrics in cheaper form for general consump-tion.
It may be that when the British Model House mentionedin paragraph 67 is in operation, the position as regardsthe British manufacturer will be improved.64. Haying regard to our conclusions under heads (a)  (b)and (o), we find that competition is unfair only in so faras it ariaes from depreciation of French currency whichoperates so as to create an export bounty in favour of theFrench manufacturer.(6) WHETHER THE APPLICANT INDUSTRY IS BEING CARRIED ON IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WITH REASONABLE EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY.65. The Opponents did not at first challenge the generalefficiency and economical conduct of the industry, but drew our attention to the following points:-(a) That the concentration by Bradford manufacturers on the production of double warp fabrics places them at a disadvantage as compared with the French manufacturers who specialise in single warp fabrics.(b) That the industry is not economically conducted by reason of the high cost of dyeing and combing charges.We have already&apos;dealt with the question of double and single warp fabrics in paragraphs 31 to 33 and the question of combing and dyeing charges has also been mentioned in Paragraph 36. 66. The case for the Opponents was designed to prove thatcontinental manufacturers are more adaptable to changing fashions than Bradford, but the Applicants satisfactorily demonstrated to us that Bradford goods were in every way equal to those produced by Foreign manufacturers.    Several times during the hearing witnesses for the Opponents stated that certain cloths were not manufactured in Bradford but these statements were immediately countered by the
Applicants producing Innumerable samples which v?ere made in Bradford.   We are convinced that it is on price that in the main Bradford is temporarily beaten,  and the Opponents agreed that certain types of goods produced in Bradford have no equal, and their quality is undisputed.    They,  however, asserted that women to-day do not demand quality and durability, but owing to ever-changing fashion they require an article which will drape and handle we 11^ and which is cheap in price.   In this respect they consider the French have an advantage.67. In, order that British manufacturers may no longer be atthe mercy of foreign Model Houses, a British Model House has now been established in London by British manufacturers, with the object of producing garments from British material which it is hoped will appeal to leaders of fashion and large makers-up generally.     We understand that it is part of the arrangements that every purohaser shall be informed where the material and trimmings oan be obtained.    In our view this goes far to negative any suggestion of want of efficiency in this connection and indicates that the industry is alive to the necessity of conducting its business in an efficient manner. As another instanoe of alertness we are informed that during the last few months the Bradford Chamber of Commerce has held joint meetings with the Drapers&apos; Chamber of Trade in order fully to disouss in what way they can be of mutual assistance. We understand that a joint oommittee of these two bodies has now been formed and it   is the intention of Bradford to shew to the retailers, through the Drapers&apos; Chamber of Trade, their latest productions, 68. We also received evidence that steps have been takenin the woollen and worsted trade to reduce costs,  one instanoe being the establishment of an Employers&apos; Liability
Inauranoe Company whereby we were informed considerableeconomies have been effected.Another Company has beenformed under the title of Wool Textiles Supplies, Limited, in order to manufacture Reeds and Healds.    The Applicantsstated that the Company has justified the claim that it supplies these articles of the highest standard at the lowest cost.    The Applicants further instanced the Textile Manufacturers&apos; Waste Company, Limited.   It is to this company that they sell the wastes produced in the course of manufacture, which are sorted,  classified and sold in bulk at prioes far more remunerative than formerly.   We were also informed that the   federations In the woollen and worsted industries have examined the question of costings and have produced a guide for their members which they claim will assist them in producing reliable costings and thereby assist in making the firms more efficient.    The industry also has a Research Association which is doing valuable work,  9&apos; We are of opinion that the Applicant Industry is beingparried on in the United Kingdom with reasonable efficiency and economy.(7) WHETHER THE IMPOSITION OP A DUTY ON GOODS OP THE CLASS OR DESCRIPTION IN QUESTION WOULD EXERT A SERIOUSLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON EMPLOYMENT IN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY BEING AN INDUSTRY USING GOODS OF THAT CLASS OR DESCRIPTION IN PRODUCTION.employs a considerable number of workers, would be affected by a duty on imported woollen and worsted fabrics.     This trade,  they stated, attaches great Importance to having an open market in which to buy their cloth.     They pointed out that there had been a very large increase in the marufaoture, of women&apos;s ready-to-wear garments during the past few years70.The Opponents contended that the making-up trade, whioh
for homo&apos; and export trade, and that employment in this industry would be affected by the increased cost of its raw material.They suggested that England is the centre of the textilewarehouse trade and that foreign buyers come here becausethey know that no duty is included in the price of goods.    they maintained that, owing to the profits of the importer, whole-saler and retailer, the l/- duty on a 3/- cloth would bedoubled by the time the material reaches the ultimate purchaser.Therefore, if the price of cloth is forced up, less will be bought and employment in the making-up trades will be affected.They stated that a duty on imported cloth would increase thecost of production in this country, because, owing to theincreased cost of clothing to the community, the cost ofliving would rise, and thereby our export trade would beaffected.     The cost of clothing,  they stated, was alreadymuch higher than the increased cost of living since 1914.    Inexplaining how the duty would be doubled the Opponentsmentioned that the wholesaler received 12^ per cent, profit1/on- returns, the maker-up 20 per cent, and the retailer 33 &apos;3rd per cent.    The rate of profit on &quot;cost&quot; would of course be higher.    Thus, all these percentages would considerably increase the cost of garments made from dutiable material. Further,  the duty would throw the trade into the hands of wealthy concerns, as importers possessing but slender financial resources would not be able to pay the duty.    They further asserted that a duty might have a serious effect on our export, re-export and colonial shipping trade, as, If a duty of ZS^/zrd per cent, were imposed upon imports into this country, other countries might retaliate by raising their duties.    They went on to state that the tariff in Franoe and Germany is much smaller than that proposed by the Applicants, that our export trade in men&apos;s worsted is considerable and
would be affected if foreign countries raised their tariffs. They further expressed the view that the duty would affect the export trade in made-up good3 owing to the difficulty in securing drawbacks.    The representatives of the Trade Unions mentioned that a duty on woollens and worsteds might cause harm to the shoddy trades as other countries oould put an export tax on rags.    Prices In this country would then rise and unemployment result.    It was the considered opinion of the Trade Unions concerned that a duty on imported woollens and worsteds would increase unemployment in the long run as a gain in the home trade would be lost by reduced exports.    The Opponents added that the re-export trade would also be affected, as merchants would prefer to ship from the country of origin and thus avoid difficulty in respect of drawbacks. They claimed that unemployment would thereby be caused amongst packers, carters, dockers, casemakers, etc.    The Opponents also contended that if a duty were put on cloth there was nothing to prevent the yarn being imported instead and thereby unemployment might be caused amongst spinners In this country.71. On the other hand the Chairman of the London Employers&apos;Association and Wholesale Mantle and Costume Manufacturers&apos; Federation appeared before us and said that their members were in favour of the application provided that the duty was graduated aooording to the value of the cloth, and that the duty on garments be imposed at the maximum rate.    He stated that the number of employees of the members of the London Employers&apos; Association amounted    to from 80/100,000.    These organisations, we were informed, have members throughout the country and comprise the principal firms in Great Britain manufacturing women&apos;s and children&apos;s goods, costumes and mantles.72. Further evidence was given in support of the Applicants&apos;case by a large clothing manufacturer to the effect that it was very difficult to say whether a duty would increase the price of clothes.    He stated that shops sell at regular
fixed prices and the incidence of increased cost might be circumvented by substituting cheaper linings or a different type of material.    He did not consider that employment in the making-up industry would be affected.    The Chairman of the Bradford Merchants1 Association apprehended no decrease of employment in the merchanting trade, and he suggested that the duty need not necessarily affect the price to the public, as the distributors might be content with less profit since the advantage in buying cheaply is not always handed on to the public.   He mentioned that wholesale garment makers all work to fixed prices and demand cloth at a certain price.    It was his opinion that the larger production in Bradford as a result of the duty would cheapen the cost.    Another wholesaler appearing on behalf of the Applicants stated that the duty would not be prejudicial but indirectly beneficial to the industry.73. The weight of evidence indicated that employment in otherindustries would not be adversely affected but that the imposition of a duty Bhould enable   Bradford manufacturers to reduce their costs and that competition already existing between home manufacturers would be stimulated, thereby counteracting any incentive to raise prices.74. With regard to the suggestion that yarn might be importedinstead of cloth,  a witness for the Applicants stated that it would be impracticable to do this because yarn is imported in such a form that Bradford manufacturers cannot handle it, for example, on paper tubes.    Further,  the transport charges would be too heavy,    ^e stated that the bulk of imported yarn is used in the hosiery trade.    Another witness corroborated this point, stating that foreign yarn i3 not suitable for Bradford goods but mentioned that foreigners might probably concentrate on the yarn -for the hosiery trade.
75. We are of opinion that the Imposition, of a duty on goods of the class or desoription in question would not exert aseriously adverse effect on employment in any other industrybeing an industry using goods of that description in production.(8) WHETHER, HAVING REGARD TO THE ABOVE CONDITIONS, THE APPLICANT INDUSTRY HAS,  IN THE OPINION OP THE COMMITTEE,  ESTABLISHED A CLAIM TO A DUTY AND,  IF SO, WHAT BATE OR RATES OF DUTY IN THE OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE REASONABLY SUFFICIENT TO COUNTERVAIL THE UNFAIR COMPETITION.76. The Applicants claimed a duty at the rate of SsWrd.per cent, ad valorem but the Chairman of the London Employers&apos; Association suggested a graduated duty to include made-up garments and that the duty on garments should be at the rate claimed.    The Applicants defined the goods on which they desired a duty as follows&quot;All dyed or undyed imported tissues or fabrics &quot;manufactured from warp and weft in a weaving loom (whether &quot;in the piece or in any other form) and made wholly or &quot;partly from wool or hair, of any weight from 2 ozs. per sq. yd. &quot;up to and including 11 ozs. per square yard but excluding felts, &quot;rags and tailors&apos; clippings.&quot;    They suggested that If imported worsteds are partly of cotton, the duty should be levied ad valorem on the whole fabricj but if the wool is mixed with silk or other material already dutiable,  the duty should be levied ad valorem at the rate which is the higher of the two.77. The Opposition objected to the duty covering woollensas well as worsteds even though within the terms of reference, on the ground that the whole of the evidence tendered by the applicants was directed to worsteds and not to woollens.    They oontended that the difference in wages cost between Great Britain and France shows a much smaller peroentage in relation to the total value of the finished article than the rate
of duty asked for.    They stated that the cost of weaving ie only 9% of the total cost of the material,  so that a duty of 33V3td. per cent, on the cloth would amount to over 330$ on the work done by the weavers. 7g. (a) In view of the conclusions at which we have arrived onthe specific points laid down for our consideration in the White Paper, we are of opinion that the Applicants have failed to substantiate a oase for the imposition of a duty, inasmuch as we find that the evidence upon the vital question of unemployment does not support the view that employment in the industry is being seriously affeoted by the volume of retained imports.(b) Had the case been proved to our satisfactionin this respect, we find that a duty at the rate of 12^- per cent, ad valorem would have been adequate to countervail the existing export bounty which Foreign manufacturers are now deriving from depreciating currency, but for the reason above stated WE DO NOT RECOMMEND the imposition of such .a duty.(c) We recognise that any further marked depreciation of foreign currencies will operate to augment the existing bounty to foreign manufacturers, to the disadvantage of manufacturers in the United Kingdom and this may well influence the volume of importation, with consequent serious effect upon employment in this country.(d) We therefore recommend that close observation be directed to the future trend of the three factors in operation, vi7a) Depreciation of foreign currenciesb) volume of retained imports (c) Employment in the Industry.(e) If seriously increased unemployment in the industry arising from a substantial increase in the volume of retained imports be accompanied by an increase in the bounty obtained
by foreign manufacturers as a result of further currency depreciation.  WB RECOMMEND THAT A DUTY TO BE COMPUTED UPON THE BASIS OF THE KATE OP 12-fr PER CENT. MENTIONED ABOVE, BE IMPOSED, WHICH WILL BE FOUND SUFFICIENT TO COUNTERVAIL THE EXPORT BOUNTY OBTAINED BY FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS.(f) For the purposes of calculating the rate of 12f per cent, above mentioned, we have taken French currency as being approximately of the.exchange value of 130 francs to the   sterling, Belgian francs 107 to the   sterling,  and Italian lire 121 to the   sterling.(g) Such duty should be imposed on all dyed or undyed imported tissues or fabrics manufactured from warp and weft in a weaving loom (whether in the piece or in the form of apparel or cut out ready for manufacture into apparol) of any weight from 2 ozs. per square yard up to and including 11 ozs. per square yard,  and made wholly or partly of wool or hair, but excluding felts, rags and tailors&apos; clippings.    In the case of fabrics or apparel already dutiable under the silk or other duties, it is not our intention that an additional duty should be imposed but that whichever rate is the higher should prevail.(h) In order to confine our recommendations as nearly as possible to the scope of this Enquiry, we further recommend that apparel and fabrics containing a component of wool or hair, of the value of 10 per cent, or less, should be excluded from the operation of such duty.(i) If hereafter, the conditions prevailing are deemed sufficient to warrant the imposition of an Import Duty,  such duty should be at the eame rate on made-up goods as on cloth, and we consider it should be imposed on all apparel, or goods intended to be used in the manufacture of apparel.    It is not
our intention that the Import Duty should be imposed on any other articles containing woollen or worsted fabric. It is in our view desirable that if an Import Duty be imposed a corresponding drawback on materials In the piece should be granted on re-exportation. The question of drawbacks on made up articles is, we suggest, a matter for consideration by the Board of Trade and H.M. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, and we therefore refrain from making any suggestions In this direction, While it will,  in our opinion, be essential for drawbacks to be granted on materials in tho piece, we fully recognise that serious administrative difficulties lie in the way of extending the drawback to articles made up in this countr-y, as, owing to the similarity in many types of cloth produced in this country and abroad, it may well prove to be impossible to establish the origin of the cloth in apparel intended for export.We desire to place on record our sense of appreciation of the very great assistance rendered to us by Captain 3.3,J.Brady, M.B.E., who has acted as Secretary to the Committee. His technical knowledge of the industry has been invaluable and the discharge of his duties has been characterised by high ability and unsparing effort.iVe have the honour to be Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Signed).

$04RESERVATIONS. 0     1While concurring generally in the above report I wish tomake the following reservations:-(a) Clause 30.    I do not consider It has been proved that imports are  at present being retained in abnormal quantities, but it is clear that if Imports continue to increase to the same extent as in the past few years they soon will become abnormal.(b) Clause 78 (d) and (e). In view of my reservation above, I agree that close observation should be directed to the future trend of the three factors In operation, viz:-( a) Depreciation of foreign currencies,(b) Volume of retained imports,(c) Employment in the industry.If seriously increased unemployment in the industry arising from a substantial increase in the volume of retained imports is accompanied by an increase in the bounty obtained by foreign manufacturersas a result of further currency depreciation, 1 consider that,the duty recommended should not be imposed until a wider enquiry has been held over the industry as a whole to ascertain as to whether the costs of combing, spinning and dyeing, as well as weaving, have been brought to such a point as to prove that every effort has been made to manufacture the goods in this country at a competitive cost. If this be proved, then I am of opinion that sufficient duty should be imposed to countervail the export bounty obtained by foreign manufacturers due to the depreciation of the currency.I make this reservation because the Applicant industry were worsted weavers only and, being a small part of the woollen and worsted industry, I do not consider it advisable to place an import duty on woollen and worsted tissues until due enquiry has been made in every branch to ascertain whether they are manufacturing with reasonable efficiency and economy.(Signed) E.
