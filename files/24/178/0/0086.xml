CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,   r4blS DOCUMENT IS THB PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).MET. C A B I U E I. 0opy No,j,p.86(26) HOME AOTAIRS COMMITTEE.COUNTY BOROUGHS BILL, Memorandum by the Minister of t Health.This Bill carries into effaot the reoent recommendations of the Royal Commission on Local Government on the first part of their termB of reference, and I shall be glad to reoeive authority to introduce it in the House of Lords,The Royal Commission contained representatives of all the Associations of Local Authorities and they presented an agreed report.     I have just ascertained that it is probable that the Oounty Councils Association may suggest that legislation should be deferred until the Royal Commission have also reported on the second part of their terms of reference, hut this report may not he made for two years or more, and I consider, therefore, that immediate legislation on the agreed recommendations is desirable, the more so that these recommendations are complete in themselves.     It must he borne in mind that Town Councils have In some oases been holding up their applications for nearly 4 years and strong resentment would be felt at any further delay.The proposals of the Bill are that -1.   Towns shall not he constituted County Boroughs unless they have a population of at least 75,000 persons, the present limit being 60,000 (Clause 1). fc.   All proposals for the constitution of new County Boroughs and all proposals for the extension of County Boroughs shall in future be made by Private Bill instead of byProvisional/
O JL wProvisional order, unless no objection is raised by Counties, Boroughs or i-istriots affeoted to the latter form of procedure, or unless objection having been raised is subsequently withdrawn (Clauses 1 and 8),   At present, they can he made either by private Bill or by application to the Minister of Health for a provisional order. 3,   section 1 and tha First Sofcedule of the Borough Funds Act, 1903, (relating to the holding of meetings of electors and the taking of polls before a private Bill oan be promoted) are not to apply to Private Bills promoted solely under this Bill (Clause S). 4.   When the boundaries of any local authority are altered, compensation for the increase of burden in respect of the maintenance of roads may be made up to a limit of El years&apos; purchase, instead of 15 as at present (Clause 5).The recommendation of the Royal Commission on this matter was restricted in terms to cases of the constitution or extension of County Boroughs, their report being con-fined to this class of Authorities, but all Authorities must manifestly be treated alike in this matter.The Royal Commission also recommended that there should &quot;be an appeal to the Ministry of Transport where -(i)   a bounty Council refuses to &quot;main&quot; a road, and (2)   where differences arise between a County Council and Urban Authorities on the question whether the County Council should contribute towards the cost of improvements on main roads maintained and repaired by the Urban Authorities,It is proposed to include provisions to this effect a Ministry of Transport Bill.H.C.*5tn February, 1926.
