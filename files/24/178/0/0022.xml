(THIS TOCUMEHT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GO TOJRNMSNT),S 3 ORE T.C, P. 21 (26) Copy iTo.^  0 A B I g 38 !T.UNIVERSITY    OP   LOITOOH.130lOMOEtAJSTDUM by the PRESIDENT of the BOARD of EDUCATION.As the Cabinet is considering the programme of legisla-tion for the coming Session, it may be well that I should bring to the attention of my Colleagues one natter with regard to which legislation may be neceseary,A Departmental Committee was appointed by the then President of the Board of Education in, 1024 to consider the constitution of the University of London and to formulate pro-posals to guide a Statutory Commission, as in the case of the recent Royal Commissions on Oxford and Cambridge.     A reform of the constitution of the University is long overdue.     It is cumbrous and gives the University no real hold over its many constituent Colleges, and consequently no control over its own policy.     This weakness is particularly evident in matters of finance.     At present the University Grants Committee of the Treasury is obliged to allocate a grant separately to each constituent part of the University,     This ie quite contrary to the principle of University autonomy whioh the Committee applies elsewhere, and Its last published Report contains a strong oon-condemnation of the practice which the present constitution of London University forces upon it,     I understand that it is, therefore, the view of the Treasury and their advisers that the present state of things should not be allowed to continue, in the interests either of the University or of the Treasury, which now gives annually over ,2450,000 in grants to the various units of which the University is composed,     I may add that it is no secret that the main excuse of the London County Council for giving no more than it does to London University education is
the present constitution of the University.The Departmental Committee will probably report in March next as soon as its Chairman,  Commander Hilton   Young, returns from India.      I have no official knowledge of what the Report will contain, but J. believe that it will be a short and business like document on which a Statutory Commission will be able to work;    &quot; that it will avoid the more controversial aspects of the problem; and that its main feature will be a&quot; recommendation to 3et up a body inside the University which can be given a block grant from the Treasury to distribute among the various colleges.   Any change in the present constitution will, of course,  be opposed by some people, but I do not think that the opposition to a limited proposal of this kind will be serious or that a short Bill to set up a Statutory Commission for London University will be very controversial, or likely to take up any appreciable amount of parliamentary time.       Past history, however, makes it clear that it will     greatly reduce the risks of controversy if a   Bill follows as closely as possible upon the issue of the Departmental Committee&apos;s Report, and I understand that the Treasury and their advisers are accordingly most anxious that no time should be lost in putting it through.It   is, of course, of the utmost importance that no hint of what the Committee is likely to report should leak out in advance.,B.P.2 3rd January, 1926.
