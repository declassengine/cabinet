E C g ST.---- CABINET.99(S3).HOURS FOR THE SALE -OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR IN CLUBS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.As my colleagues are aware,   strong demands have recently been made by various organisations representing over four thousand working men&apos;s and other clubs, for a return to pre-war freedom in regard to the supply of intoxicating liquor in registered clubs or,  at the least, for considerably greater latitude than is allowed by the existing law (Licensing Act, 1921).    This proposal is strongly opposed by those who,  in the interests of temperance,  are asking not only that   .the existing restrictions should be maintained but that the law should be amended in various ways so as to secure more effective control over registered clubs.    A similar attitude in favoxir of greater control over registered clubs is taken up by many bodies of licensing justices including the Magistrates&apos;  Association.In November last 1 received two deputations - one from representatives of the clubs and one from representatives of the temperance organisations,  - who put before me these divergent points of view,  and I promised that I would pla.ce the views of the deputations fully and fairly before the Cabinet in order that they might decide what action should be taken.The accompanying extracts from the proceedings of these deputations  (Appendix II) will,  I think,  sufficiently indicate the nature of these demands and the facts and arguments which have been submitted in support of them by the two deputations.   . A note  (Appendix i) is also annexed summarising the history of the question and indicating the various considerations to be borne in mind.This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos; s Government.
It would be superfluous to emphasise the well known difficulties and far reaching consequences which may be involved in any decision by the Government to undertake legislation affecting this aspect of the licensing problem.    The club problem forms part of a complicated whole and cannot be isolated and detached for separate treatment.    I do not think the.time is yet ripe for any general amendment or complete overhaul of the licensing system,  and it would be difficult at the moment to emfeark on any amendments affecting clubs only without becoming involved in highly controversial issues which might extend over the whole field of licensing legislation.Moreover,  it is to be remembered that a Committee which I appointed last year under the Chairmanship of Lord Southborough for the purpose of examining the possibilities involved in schemes of disinterested management of public houses has not yet concluded its labours.    The position of registered clubs as suppliers of intoxicating liquor in competition with licensed premises in the same district must necessarily,  I think, fall to a certain extent within the purview of this Committee and it is possible that they may make some recommendation for the&apos; amendment of the law affecting registered clubs.    This is an additional reason why I should prefer that the Government should not at present undertake any amending legislation on the subject of registered clubs.It was suggested by members of the deputation of temperance bodies that an inquiry might be held in order to ascertain the facts.    In my reply to this deputation I indicated that a full and complete inquiry into the whole position might be desirable.    I am not quite satisfied, however,  that the present time would be a convenient one for holding such an inquiry and I should prefer that consideration of this suggestion also should be postponed until the Southborough Committee has issued its report.March,   1926.W .T  FT
APPENDIX I.CLUB HOURS.NOTE ON HISTORY AND PRESENT POSITION.The alleged pledge of Mr,, Lloyd George-.Before 1915 there was no restriction of the hours of sale of intoxicating liquor in clubs *   ,-Restrictions were first introduced by regulations made by the Liquor Control Board&apos; in the exercise of powers conferred on them by the Defence of the Realm Act,  1915. These powers were superseded by the Licensing Act of 1921.It is contended that the Act of 1921 was a breach of a pledge given by Mr, Lloyd George when he introduced the Defence of the realm Act of 1915n    In that speech he said -&quot;We propose to take powers,  limited to the period of the War, because we do not want to raise any issue beyond that.    I do not mind saying that I should have liked,  If it had been possible,  to have taken this opportunity cf putting the nation In a position at the end of the War to deal with this problem without the complication of vested interests,    After all - the House will allow me to say this - the nation has got to live afterwards.    It could perhaps afford a drink bill of  160,000,000 before the War.    Even then many lived in squalor and misery,    But it was a prosperous period.    No one knows how long this War will last.    No one knows how exhausting it will be0    What *we could afford before the War we certainly cannot afford after the Ware    One of the things we cannot afford is a drink bill of  160.,000*000.    I had hoped it was possible, by the agreement of all parties,  for us to be placed in a position to do something that would have given us complete control during the War, and which would have made it unnecessary for us,  either to have very heavy taxation,  or any of those other expedients which would give us complete control,  at the same time leaving us free-men of-all parties,  to consider, when we put our heads together, how we are to rebuild our country..    However, that is not the proposal I am now making,    1 simply propose that we shall have powers during the War&quot;.    (Hansard for 29th April,  1915.)These words referred not specifically to clubs but to thegeneral proposals for the control of liquor, and all that theyimply is that the War legislation was not to commit anyone . as towhat the policy should be after the War.    There appears to have been no specific pledge to restore pre-war freedom to clubs.The Post War position.At the end of the War the view was widely held that, while relaxation of many of the War restrictions was inevitable and proper,
experience had demonstrated that the principle of restricted hours was a good one and that it would he undesirable to return to unrestricted supply of liquor in clubs and to the full day opening of licensed premises.    There is evidence that the trade itself shared this view.    Bills were introduced in 1920 and in 1921 by representatives of the trade (Colonel Gretton introduced the Bill of 1921) which, while designed to relax the existing restrictions, yet recognised (l) the principle of permitted hours (2) the necessity of bringing clubs under more stringent control and (3) the desirability of making public houses something better than drinking shops.The Act of 1921.In the early part of 1921 a Parliamentary &quot;Round Table&quot; Conference was arranged consisting of Members of the House of Commons who represented various shades of opinion.    This Conference, over which the then Attorney-Genera J. (now Lord Hewart) presided and of which Mr. R, Richardson, M.P., the President of the Working Men&apos;s club and Institute Union, was a member, reached a large measure of agreement on the principal questions involved.    It was on the basis of the recommendations of this Conference that the provisions of the Licensing Act, 1921, are based.   Under that Act registered clubs are subject to the same general restrictions as licensed premises in regard to the total number of permitted hours but, unlike licensed premises, clubs oan settle for themselves during what hours they will supply liquor subject only to the limitations (l) that they must not begin to supply liquor before or continue to supply it after the earliest and latest times laid down in the Act, and (2) there must be a &quot;break&quot; between the permitted hours in the morning and the permitted hours in the.afternoon so that liquor fiannot be supplied continuously during the wholepf the maximum of 8 hours (or,  in the Metropolis,  9 hours) allowed during the 24 hours. Clubs are therefore allowed more elasticity in regard to permitted hours than licensed premises for which the permitted
hours are fixed by the licensing justices in each district.The present demands of the clubs.The proposals made by the representatives of the registered clubs at the deputation of November 5th are that on weekdays the hours of supply in clubs should be any twelve before midnight and that every club shall have the right to determine during which of those twelve hours intoxicating liquor may be obtainable by its members.    it is also proposed that one hour shall be added to the existing permitted hours on Sundays.    (This is. merely their interim demand^    they continue in the press to make it clear that their real demand is to regard a Club as a private house and drink at all hours-. )In effect these proposals mean that the existing maximum of permitted hours for- clubs on weekdays would,  in the case of registered clubs in the Metropolis,  be extended by three hours, and by four hours in the case of clubs outside the Metropolis. The two hour &quot;break&quot; which is required under Section 1 of the Act of 1921 would no longer apply to clubs, with the result that a club could so fix its hour that liquor might be supplied continuously from noon to midnight.The adoption of an unbroken twelve hour period of permitted hours in clubs would tend to accentuate an anomaly that,  to some extent, has been observed in the operation of the Act of 1921. By an arrangement of their permitted hours the. clubs in a particular district may be able to supply drink to their members during the hours when the sale of drink in licensed premises is prohibited. Thus there may be, and probably are,  in some districts almost continuous facilities for drinking from the earliest to the latest hour allowed by law.    The present proposal of a twelve hours period for clubs would obviously increase the opportunity for such arrangements.   &apos;Probable attitude of the Liquor Trade.If any substantial concession is made to clubs as regards
permitted hours,  it is almost certain that an equivalent extension of facilities for the sale of liquor in licensed premises would at once be demanded,  at any rate by a great majority of the trade interests.    The clubs,  it is true, base their claim to preferential treatment upon the argument that &quot;members&quot;  clubs are not placeti where the public can obtain drink but are private premises in which liquor is the  joint property of the members and is supplied only to them.    But this argument will not convince the licensed victuallers who regard the clubs as rivals in the sale of drink.The position of the brewers is more doubtful.    Some of them are to a certain extent financially interested in clubs and, as customers, clubs are not to be ignored.    On the other hand, as owners of public houses they would probably regard concessions to clubs as unfair discrimination.Possible increase in clubs.A criticism of the proposed extension of drinking hours in clubs is that It might lead to a considerable infcrease In the number of registered clubs - which, under the existing system of non-discretionary registration,  could not be held in check - and that this increase would tend still further to neutralise the efforts of the licensing justices in getting rid of redundant public houses.    This criticism however may be carried (and often is carried) too far.    Even if the rate of increase in clubs were appreciably greater than it is at present, the rate of decrease in on-licences would more than balance the position.    To illustrate this it may be mentioned that over the whole period from 1904 to the end of 1924 registered clubs have increased by 5,100 as compared with a decrease of 18,94-2 in on-licences during the same period.    These figures require very careful analysis to appreciate the true deduction to be drawn from them.    Nevertheless the growth in the number of clubs whose revenue is alleged to be drawn mainly from the supply of intoxicating liquor is a source of considerable uneasiness to the temperance bodies.
Against the proposals put forward by the clubs the temperance interests and many of the licensing justices have strongly urged that registered clubs should be subject to the same permitted hours as licensed premises in the same district. This proposal is open to the objection that different kinds of clubs require different hours and that it would not be reasonable to expect, e.g, a golf club to have the same permitted hours as the public houses in the same district. Further proposals put forward by the temperance bodies are -(a) that licensing justices should have full discretion to grant or refuse an application to register a new club, instead of the present law under which the clerk to the justices is bound to register upon application duly made:(b) that existing clubs should be required to renew their registration annually and that such renewal may be refused on certain grounds:(c) that when a club is struck off the register the premises may be disqualified for use as a club for five years:(d) that police officers should have the right of entry into clubs without warrant.The experience of the Home Office indicates that a substantial case can be made out for these proposals - especially (d) - but they would, of course,  arouse strong opposition in many quarters.
APPENDIX II.CLUB DEPUTATION.This deputation included representatives of the Association of Conservative Clubs,  the Club and Institute Union,  the National Federation of Liberal Clubs, the Golf Clubs Protection Association, and a few other Clubs,Sir Herbert Nield,  speaking on behalf of the Association of Conservative Clubs, said there are 1,521 Clubs affiliated to the Organisation and the total membership exceeds 500,000.In 1925 Conferences had been held in ten important centres and at each of these Conferences the absorbing interest had been the question of existing restrictions,  and resolutions had been spontaneously and unanimously carried protesting against outside interference.The stand taken by Clubmen is on three incontrovertible grounds:-(1) That Clubs are private premises,  to which none but members have access as of right. (2) That the refreshments supplied are the joint propertyof members.(3) That none other than members can purchase them.By what right, members ask,   are they denied access to their own property, on their own premises, and at times when they desire to make use of that property?Clubs are in no way concerned with the hours of sale in licensed houses, for between Clubs and ordinary licensed houses there are these fundamental differences:-In Clubs, the refreshments are the property of members collectively;    none other obtain them,  and no individual member can derive a farthing profit from their disposal, whilst in the case of licensed houses, drink is a commodity sold to &quot;all and sundry&quot; for the gain of the vendor, and,  Indeed, by law   &apos; must be supplied to any person not being a child,  or already under the influence of alcohol.
-2-R1 7Again.,  in the case of Clubs, refreshments are merely     - &apos; incidental to the main objects for which they were founded, wiailst in public houses  (save in the case of Trust Houses, hotels and the like) the sale of drink is the sole object of their existence,The argument that there is parity between public houses and Clubs is,  therefore, fallacious.    Clubs decline to be placed on the level of,  or in the same category as,  public houses.    It is well that this should be more generally realised than is the case at present in some quarters *The main cause of the grievance lay, he said,  in the Licensing Act of 1921.    The Bill was supposed to be an &quot;agreed measure&quot; but it was nothing of the kind.    He himself had protested against the Report of the. Committee on which, the Bill was based,  but his protests were met with the statement that if the Bill were not accepted nothing would be done to remove war restrictions.What has incensed clubmen more than anjrthing else isthe violation of the pledge given by Mr. Lloyd George when therestrictions were originally imposed.    Speaking in the Houseof Commons on .April 29th,  1915, he said:&quot;We propose to take powers limited to the period of the war,  because we do not want to raise any issue beyond that.&quot;The temporary surrender of rights which Clubs had long enjoyed was acquiesced in,  solely and wholly on the strength of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s pledge that the surrender was to be limited &quot;to the period of the war&quot;.The Association of Conservative Clubs took a plebiscite of Clubs affiliated to our organisation on the question of the present hours as permitted by the Licensing Act 1921.    Ninety-five per cent, of the replies received to the specific questions addressed to our Clubs showed:-(l) That universal discontent prevailed at the existing state of affairs,(2) That,  owing to varying local conditions,  the discontent would not be removed until Clubs were again permitted to
regulate their own internal oonoerns.(3) That the present permitted hours of supply in Clubswere insufficient, and in many places unsuitable, to therequirements of members.He asserted that the allegation that when licences arecancelled on the ground of redundancy they are replaced byClubs was a &quot;very largely exaggerated&quot; allegation.Speaking on behalf of Clubs used mainly by the workingclasses he saidUnder the existing limitation, refreshments for the most part, are obtained at hours during which members are engaged following their various avocations, and cannot be at the Club to enjoy them,.    On the other hand, at the very time when they can be at their Club for social and recreative purposes,  and may desire a drink, the supply is arbitrarily shut down and they are denied access to their own property.    In Clubs in South Wales, Lancashire,  Yorkshire, Durham and elsewhere, many members engaged in the mining industry are, through the operation of the &quot;shift&quot; system, unable to get anyrefreshment at all.........The 1921 Act was a piece of class legislation of the worst possible description, and directed especially against the working classes.    Whilst opulent people, with the necessary house accommodation, can entertain their guests and supply them with refreshments all day and until any hour of the night, without let or hindrance, the working man, who has no such accommodation and who, therefore, resorts to his club to enjoy the society of his friends, is peremptorily ordered by the Act to pack up and go to bed at 11 p.m.  (and even at 10.30) in London and 10 p.m. in the country.    It is this modern method of treating adults as children in this and many other direations, which is responsible for much of the unrest in the labour world from which the country is suffering to-day.He stated that there was no wish on the part of the Clubsfor which he spoke &quot;that the unrestricted hours which prevailedin pre-war days should be restored&quot;,    &quot;we desire to help in finding a solution to this problem.    We therefore suggest that the hoursof supply ..... shall be restricted to 12, and that it shall be within the competence of every club to select any 12 hours itchooses prior to midnight .....    It does not follow ........that all Clubs would keep open the whole of the 12 hours .....What, however, is desired is the right to do so if they feel sodisposed, and for members to have access to their own property athours best suited to their convenience.    With regard to Sundays,an additional hour of supply would be accepted, though underprotest, as a small measure of justice&quot;.
Mr. B.T. Hall, speaking for the Working Men&apos;s Club and Institute Union, said it consisted of 2,472 Clubs with, a membership of over 900,000.    He argued that &quot;the 1921 Aot, is based on the supposition that the hours of leisure (as distinct from work) are the same in all areas and with all classes of people&quot;, that in many parts of England men worked from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. &quot;leaving work at the very moment when what they most desire and need is snatched from their lips&quot;.    He apparently was against all restrictions on the hours of Clubs,  saying &quot;We do not believe any further powers are required ...... thanthe law already gave in the Act of 1902&quot;.Mr. Richardson, M.P. pointed out how much had been done by Clubs to improve the social conditions, especially in the mining districts.He pointed out that the shift system played a very important part In mining life and that men on the night shift were usually in bed till about 9 p.m.    These men &quot;are shut out. entirely from any use of the Club&quot;.Mr. Broadbent,  speaking on behalf of the National Liberal Clubs, said he represented 75 Clubs and over 100,000 members. He emphasized the point that the shift system made it impossible for many of the members to obtain the refreshment they required in the permitted hours.Mr. Hynes,  representing the Golf Clubs Association, said it was a grievance that golfers who played a round before going to business could not have a drink before 11 o*clock in the morning.Major Cuningham, representing the London Clubs Protection Association, said &quot;We do not greatly care as a matter of convenience for an extension of hours, but we base our protest on the principle that our clubs are our houses.    We should prefer to ask as a matter of principle for a complete rescission of control in our Clubs&quot;.Mr. Richards,  speaking on behalf of the Clubs of Wales, elaborated the arguments about the inconvenience caused to miners, railwaymen,  iron and steel workers and others employed on shifts, by the present restrictions on hours&apos;.
p, 9 nAPPENDIX II  (Oontd. ). u    0THE DEPUTATION FROM THE TEMPERANCE COUNCIL OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES OF ENGLAND AND WALES, THE COMBINED NATIONAL TEMPERANCE AND OTHER ORGANISATIONS,  and THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF WOMEN OF GREAT BRITAIN.The main argument of the Deputation, which was in the nature of a counter deputation to that received on behalf of the Registered Clubs, was stated by the Reverend Scott Lidgett:&quot;First of all  .... there is no case for any relaxation of the existing restrictions on clubs,  secondly .... there is a good case for increasing the   restrictions on such clubsj     , ...  in the interests of morality,  in the interests of true temperance, in the interests of fair play to others who have the power to sell intoxicating drinks - in the public interest generally, it is of the greatest importance that the clubs should be brought more fully under the existing licensing law,  and .... the conditions under which they carry on the sale of intoxicating drinks should be approximated to those under which the regular trade is carried on&quot;.Arguing against any extension of the permitted hours for Clubss  the Reverend C.F. Tonks said:&quot;We believe that the argument that the Club is a privateinstitution and that the intoxicating liquors supplied are the  joint property of the members can be pressed too far, and tlie Council emphatically contends, and has strong evidence to support the contention, that the Club which supplies liquor to its members and their guests cannot be ignored when any attempts are being made to find a legislative solution of the existing drink evil.Clubs are in existence today,   in spite of any statements made to the contrary, which have been established on premises which,  as licensed premises, were closed as redundemt with heavy compensation under the  1904 Act.    Village Clubs are on the register today which have been initiated and financed by
brewers in competition with Village Institutes run on teetotal lines.Clubs are not uncommon in the large industrial centres where the profits of the liquor bar finance practically the whole club,  the membership subscription being but nominal. Facts in support of those contentions could be laid before you..Tile antagonism of the licence victuallers to the registered clubs and their dissatisfaction with the present law are based on the recognition that the liquor-supplying clubs enters into serious competition with licensed premises.    The support given on the other hand to the club movement by brewers and distillers is evidence that they look upon the clubs as providing a profitable outlet for their commodities.  ..e.....Extended hours for the supply of liquor in clubs would, moreover, be a direct inducement for lovers of the drink to organise new clubs for the purpose of obtaining liquor!    and as the law stands at present there would be nothing to prevent them from doing so      .....&quot;The proposals of the Deputation were summarised by the Reverend Tonks and Mr.  Henry Carter as follows:-&quot;Firstly there should be uniformity of hours for the sale of liquor in every locality as between all clubs and licensed premises.    This uniformity should extend not only to the number of hours but to the actual hours.    This would prevent two present evils, namely,  the passing of drinkers from club to &quot;pub&quot; and from &quot;pub&quot; to club when the actual permitted hours as between club and licensed premises do not coincide?    and also the passing of members from one club to another for the sake of obtaining liquor when the hours of different clubs do not coincide.    This passing of members from one club to another is rendered easy by the privileges accorded to club members under the system of the affiliation of clubs. Such coincidence of hours should operate as regards Sunday as well as weekday,  not only in England but also in Wales and Monmouthshire where Sunday closing is in force.
R9 9itl wSecondly,  it should be a regulation, we contend, that no young persons- under 18 years of age should be supplied with intoxicating liquor on club premises.    This would bring clubs into line with the &quot;under 18&quot; Act of 1923.Our third point is that off-sales of liquor should be entirely forbidden.We further contend that the law as regards clubs being struck off the register needs to be strengthened.    A ground for such striking off when any complaint lodged in writing is proved, should be &quot;that the club is habitually conducted mainly for the purpose of supplying and obtaining intoxicating liquors&quot;.    For the purpose of determining whether a club is conducted in good faith as a club the Court should have the right to take into consideration not only the nature and suitability of the premises occupied by the club, but also the provision of facilities for recreation and other forms of social aotivity and the percentage of the clubs total income derived from receipts for the supply of intoxicating liquors during the twelve months preceding the complaint.It should be a condition, we believe,  of remaining on the register that every club should supply annually to the Justices^ an aiidited statement of accounts and balance sheet.Today the Justices may exercise their discretion whether a club,  on proof of complaint,  shall be struck off the register or not.   We feel strongly&apos; that this discretion should apply to the first proved offence only.    On proof of a second offence the Justices should have no option but to strike the elub off the register subject to an appeal to Quarter Sessions..Lastly with regard to the inspection of clubs,  we have no desire to place either club members or thepolice in an invidious position, but we contend that a liquor-supplying club should be open to inspection, and we therefore suggest that any Police Officer, not below the rank of Inspector,  should have the right of entry into a club,  but that he should not be in uniform when engaged on this duty.......
We ask that the present mode of automatic registration of clubs should cease,  and that each application for the right of drink supply in a club should be  judicially considered 0e , , . We are satisfied that the present automatic method by which clubs can grow to any number whatsoever is defeating the policy which a Conservative Government initiated in 1904? that is, the policy of the reduction of the number of redundant licensed premises by payment of compensations&quot;In considering whether a club should be registered the judicial authority should,,  it was suggested,  have regard to &quot;the nature of the premises where it is suggested that a club should exist.    Have the premises, for example,  been used for a public house which had had its licence taken away on the ground that it is redundant?    If so.,  there are strong practical reasons for requiring an interval of a term of years between the closing of the premises as a public house and the opening of the premises as a registered club.    We would ask that the authority should also consider the bona fides of the proposed club0    Has a brewing company or a distilling company any financial interests, direct or indirect,  in the proposal?    Further, will the supply of liquor in the club be free from any tie?    In a word, does the proposal represent a genuine local public request?&quot;Mr, Carter also suggested that,  subject always to the qualifications that there was no relaxation of existing restriction-, in the interim,  they &quot;would welcome a full, fair enquiry by His Majesty&apos;s Government into the whole club question.Sir Edward Smith,  Chairman of the Justices of the Tower Division,  said that he was sure from his experience that &quot;the great bulk of the working men and women in the East End of London -particularly the women&quot;   &apos; would be against any increase of facilities for drinking in Clubs,,Lady Emmott and Mrs. Wintringham spoke for the National Council of women In opposition to any increased facilities on the ground that &quot;Clubs give an added temptation to the men on their way from work or when the public houses are closed&quot;.
