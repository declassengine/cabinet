[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1926.SECRET. Copy No. 3-CP. 7i (26).CABINET.PALESTINE LOAN GUARANTEE BILL.Note by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1. IT is proposed that the Government of Palestine should raise a loan in London for the sum of  4,000,000 for purposes which are explained below, and that His Majesty&apos;s Treasury should guarantee the payment of the principal and interest on that loan. The main reason for proposing an Imperial Guarantee of this loan is the peculiar position which Palestine occupies as a mandated territory. That position renders it practically impossible to raise a loan on the mere security of the general revenues of Palestine, since no absolute assurance could be given to the lenders that the political conditions of the territory will remain as they are at present during the next forty years, which is the probable period of the currency of the loan. In these circumstances, any loan raised on such a security would inevitably have to carry a very high rate of interest.2. The principle of an Imperial Guarantee for the Palestine loan was discussed by the Duke of Devonshire and Mr. Neville Chamberlain, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the Autumn of 1923, when it was decided that the question should stand over until further progress had been made with the settlement of certain political difficulties then engaging the attention of the Palestine Government. The question came before the late Government at a Cabinet Meeting on the 21st February, 1924, when it was decided that the question of the issue of the Palestine loan, under some form of British guarantee, should be left for arrangement between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Cabinet 16 (24), Conclusion 7). The intention to guarantee the loan was announced in the House of Lords by Lord Arnold on the 2nd July, 1924.3. It is clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government, as well as the Palestine Govern-ment, stand to gain if the loan is backed by an Imperial Guarantee. At present the Palestine Government is in receipt of a Grant-in-Aid from His Majesty&apos;s Government equal to the expenditure on the British Section of the Palestine Gendarmerie and certain expenditure in Trans-Jordan. Owing to the improved financial position of Palestine, it is hoped to reduce this Grant considerably during 1926-27. If His Majesty&apos;s Government guarantee the proposed loan, the Palestine Government, as stated above, will be able to obtain the money which it requires at a considerably lower rate of interest than it could if the loan were not guaranteed. It should thus be possible to make a further reduction in. the Grant-in-Aid equal to the saving which will accrue to the Palestine Government if the loan is floated, under the proposed guarantee.4. At the same time it is clear that, unless the finances of Palestine suffer a severe set-back, it is most unlikely that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be called on to make any payment on account of either principal or interest on the loan.5. In anticipation of the loan the Palestine Government has spent over  2,000,000 on works of a capital nature. Part of this money was advanced by the Crown Agents for the Colonies and the remainder was 1 found from the surplus balances of the Palestine budget. It is proposed to charge the whole or at any rate the greater part of this expenditure to the funds raised, by the loan, thus releasing the surplus funds for other purposes, including the repayment of certain amounts due from the Palestine Government to His Majesty&apos;s Government on account of the deficit of the Occupied Enemy Territories Administration and on account of stores taken over from His Majesty&apos;s Government. The amount due on the first account is not yet finally determined, but it falls between  210,000 and  215,000; that due[14210]&quot;
on the second account, apart from certain items still under discussion, is about  50,000. During the current year the Palestine Government has already repaid to His Majesty&apos;s Government the equivalent of  250,000 on account of stores, viz.,  162,500 in cash plus  87,500 in the form of a release from a debt of that amount due to the Palestine Government on account of Railway Services. Out of the balance of the proposed loan, provision must be made for the expense of raising the loan, estimated at  160,000, while the sum of  500,000 is to be paid to the British Treasury as the first half of a payment due to His Majesty&apos;s Government in respect of the fixed capital assets transferred to the Palestine Government in 1920. The remaining  500,000 will be repayable at a later date when the finances of Palestine permit, either by a sinking fund or by lump sum payments. Interest will begin to be payable on this debt as from the 1st April, 1926&apos;. The balance of the proceeds of the loan will be spent on works of development in Palestine, but the exact allocation between the various works has not yet been settled.6. Stores and material required for the works carried out in anticipation of the loan were ordered through the Crown Agents for the Colonies, thus ensuring that the orders were placed in this country whenever possible. For example, the Palestine Government has recently placed a contract with an English firm for the repair of twelve locomotives, which have been sent to the United Kingdom for the purpose. If the firm in question carries out the work economically, a similar contract will be placed in this country next year provided that the railway traffic warrants the additional expenditure. Stores and material required for the railway, telegraph and public works to be paid for out of the proceeds of the proposed loan would similarly be placed in the United Kingdom through the Crown Agents, and to this extent the loan will directly benefit manufacturers in this country.7. There remains the question of the provision of Harbour facilities in Palestine which it is proposed should be paid for out of the proceeds of the loan. A scheme for the construction of a Harbour at Haifa at a cost of  1.000,000 was submitted in 1923; but it has been held up owing, among other reasons, to lack of funds, and an alternative scheme is now under consideration for the improvement of the existing Harbour facilities at the ports of Jaffa and Haifa at a much lower cost. If the latter scheme is adopted it may be possible to carry out the work departmentally or by a special staff acting under the direction of the Consulting Engineers, in which case the material and plant required would be obtained from manufacturers in this country in the usual way. If, on the other hand, it is decided to proceed with the more extensive scheme at Haifa, it would probably be more economical, in view of the expensive nature of the plant required, which is useless for any other purpose, to have the &quot;works carried out by a firm of contractors under the supervision of the Consulting Engineers. Certain Italian firms have already applied to be allowed to compete in the event of the work being thrown open to tender; and it would appear to be difficult, in view of the special status of Palestine as mandated &quot;territory, to justify the express limitation of any competition for the work to British firms.8. Article 18 of the Palestine Mandate provides that there shall be &quot;no discrimination in Palestine against the nationals of any State Member of the League of Nations (including Companies incorporated under its laws) as compared with those of the Mandatory or of any foreign State in matters concerning taxation, commerce or navigation, the exercise of industries or professions, or in the treatment of merchant vessels or civil aircraft. Similarly, there shall be no discrimination in Palestine against goods originating in or destined for any of the said States, and there shall be freedom of transit under equitable conditions across the mandated area.&quot; In view of the terms of this Article it would not be practicable to attach to the guarantee of the proposed loan a formal condition such as that suggested in the Cabinet minutes of the 3rd February, viz., that any contracts for development of harbour works, &amp;c, should be given to British and not to foreign firms (Cabinet 3 (26), Conclusion 16). Any such condition would at once be challenged as a contra-vention of the mandate. In practice, British firms will, from the nature of the case, be in a position of some advantage as compared with their foreign competitors.9. The question has been considered whether it might not be possible to abandon the proposal for a guaranteed loan and to proceed instead under the Trade Facilities Act, 1924, in order to ensure that the proceeds of the loan are used in the manner best calculated to promote employment in this country. This alternative would not appear to be practicable. In 1924 the question was put to the Treasury whether mandated territories could be regarded as   &quot;part of His Majesty&apos;s
Dominions &quot; for the purposes of Section 2 of the Trade Facilities Act. The Treasury-replied (1st November, 1924) that mandated territories did not fall within the scope of the Section. This ruling is one that may possibly be open to argument; but, even if it were reversed, there are two further considerations which appear to preclude action under the Trade Facilities Act in the present case. In the first place, the Act purports -to apply to moneys raised for the purposes of new expenditure only, whereas about half the money to be raised under the proposed Palestine loan has, in effect, already been spent. Secondly, the remainder of the Palestine expenditure cannot properly be described as being &apos;&apos; in anticipation of expenditure which would normally have been incurred a,t a later date,&quot; which is a prior condition, under Section 2 (1) (b) of the Act, to any Treasury undertaking to contribute towards the payment of interest.10. A statement is appended giving the main heads of expenditure under the proposed Palestine loan. It is subject to minor adjustments as between the amounts allocated under the first six heads. It is to be noted that the amount of  500,000 under head 7 will be payable to His Majesty&apos;s Government immediately the loan is raised.Colonial Office, February 17, 1926.APPENDIX.Loan Schedule. 1.
