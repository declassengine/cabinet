[This Document is the Propterty of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1926SECRET.Copy JNo.   3QCP. 32 (28).CABINET.NEXT IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN accordance with the conclusion of the Cabinet on the 18th December (Cabinet 60 (25), Conclusion 5) the Prime Minister sent a message to the Dominion Prime Ministers on the 21st December stating that Plis Majesty&apos;s Government had been considering whether they should propose a meeting of the Imperial Conference in 1926 or 1927; that it would hardly be possible at that stage to suggest a time for assembling if the latter alternative were adopted; but that, if a meeting was arranged for 1926, it was thought that the time might be either the middle of June or the beginning of October. The message concluded with an enquiry as to the views of the Dominion Prime Ministers on the most suitable date.Replies have now been received from all the Dominions except the Irish Free State; and in a message of the 19th January the Prime Minister of the Common-wealth of Australia has suggested an early announcement that the Conference will be held. Such an announcement would, he observes, assist the Commonwealth Government materially as regards queries raised in connection with the Locarno Treaty. The Prime Minister has replied that he notes Mr. Bruce&apos;s wish for an early announcement as to the date of the Conference, and will endeavour to arrange accordingly. Copies of the telegrams to and from the Dominions will be found, in Appendix I to this memorandum.In his previous message of the 24th December, Mr. Bruce had urged strongly that the Conference should be held in June 1926. He pointed out that the announce-ment made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the 18th November, that His Majesty&apos;s Government hoped to discuss with the Dominions the whole position arising out of the Locarno Treaty at an Imperial Conference, had received wide publicity and aroused considerable interest in the Treaty, and expressed the opinion that to put off the Conference until 1927 would completely, destroy this effect and create the impression that the Treaty was relatively unimportant and the principle of consultation on such&apos; matters a comparatively unimportant formality. He expressed the conviction that the Treaty, both now and in its ultimate effect, is of paramount importance to the Dominions, and that, as its direct and logical result, new defence proposals would have to be formulated which would be of vital interest to the whole Empire, and especially those portions contiguous to the Pacific. He summed up his views in the statement : &quot; We feel that the Locarno Treaty in itself is of sufficient importance to render an early Imperial Conference essential, and that it carries with it a suggestion of further development upon which it is imperative that the Empire should be consulted and speak with a single voice.....   It isimpossible to ignore the fact that the question of inter-Imperial consultation has reached a very interesting and delicate stage, and it is highly desirable, in the interests of the Empire, that the advances we have already made in this direction should be consolidated. To delay the Conference until 1927, especially when there are so many important matters to be discussed, would be a retrograde step of a most dangerous character.&quot;The above message suggested June 1926 as the date of the Conference, but the replies of the. Prime Ministers of the Union of South Africa and Newfoundland indicate that, if the Conference is to be held this year, October would be a more convenient date from their point of view, and in his further message of the 19th January, Mr Bruce has intimated that this would be acceptable to the Common-wealth Government. The Government of India also have stated that, if the Conference is to be held this year, they would prefer October to June.[14153]B
2The Prime Minister of New Zealand at first stated that, having regard especially to the election of a new Parliament (which would not ordinarily meet until the end of June), it would be more convenient if the Conference were held in 1927, but in his message of the 6th January he stated that if His Majesty&apos;s Government, after receiving the views of all the Dominions, decide that it is in the common interest that a Conference should be convened this year, he will do his best to make such arrangements as will permit of his personal attendance.While the above replies point to October 1926 as the most suitable date for holding the Conference, the Prime Minister of Canada has stated that it is evident that the present parliamentary position in Canada makes it impossible to undertake to send representatives to a Conference in June of this year, and very uncertain whether they could be sent in October, and that, so far as Canada is concerned, early in October 1927 would at present appear the most convenient time pending an announcement by all the other Governments concerned of the dates they would prefer.Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s message appears to be based to some extent on the assumptions that the sole object of holding a Conference, at any rate this year, would be to discuss the situation resulting from the Locarno Treaty, and that, while this question is one which might well be discussed at a Conference when occasion permits, such discussion cannot be said to be essential to enable the Dominion Governments to determine their policy, and it may be necessary for them to express their opinions in advance of a Conference. While it is true that an examination of the situation resulting from Locarno would constitute a very important part of the work of the. Conference, there indicated in my memorandum of the 17th December(CP. 532 (25), several other questions, both political and economic, on which personal discussion with Dominion Ministers is highly desirable.Further, while it is naturally impossible for Canadian Ministers, in the present political situation, to express any opinion as to the possibility of attending a Conference in October next, there appears to me much force in a -suggestion made by Mr. Bruce in his message of the 19th January that the propinquity of Canada to Great Britain should render it possible for Canada to send representatives to a Conference a.t any generally suitable time. It may well be that another General Election in Canada will be necessary this year, but, unless the election actually takes place in or later than September, the position should have become sufficiently clear to render possible the presence of Canadian representatives at a Conference in October. Such information as is available points in the direction of an election as soon as estimates and other essential matters have been disposed of, i.e.. about June.I v/ould suggest that the Cabinet should now give general approval to a Conference in October.It seems to me that, in view of the statement made in the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the 18th November, on which Mr. Bruce has laid so much stress, and of the terms of the telegram sent by the Prime Minister to the Dominions on the same date, it would be difficult now for His Majesty&apos;s Government to express a preference for 1927 over 1926. General Hertzog has just made a most interesting and helpful statement in regard to the Locarno Treaty (see Appendix II). It is evident that he made it in the expectation of an early Imperial Conference, and I doubt whether he could maintain the position which he has taken up if the Conference were postponed until 1927. On the other hand, Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s feeling that he will be bound, in the event of a Parliamentary discussion of the Locarno Treaty, to announce that the Canadian Government are not disposed to recommend participation appears to be largely coloured by the view that the Conference will not be held until 1927, and it is possible that he might be able to postpone such an announcement if the Conference is held this year.In the event o.f a decision in favour of a Conference in October, the next step would appear to be for the Prime Minister to telegraph to the Prime Minister of Canada pointing out that, as he will now have seen, the general view of the Govern-ments of the other Dominions and of India is in favour of a Conference in October 1926, and that this view is shared by the Cabinet here. In the circumstances, would he concur in an announcement being made that it is intended to hold an Imperial Conference in October 1926 ?It would also seem necessary to send a reminding despatch to the Irish Free State, from whom no reply at all has yet been received.L.

RPresident of the Executive Council.      e9&quot;ins -As you are aware, Article 9 of the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee, which was initialled at Locarno, and which it is hoped will be signed on 1st December, provides that the Treaty shall impose no obligation upon any of the British Dominions or upon India unless the Government of such Dominion or of India signifies its acceptance thereof.So far as this country is concerned, Parliament is being given an immediate opportunity of discussing the Treaty and, assuming that Parliament gives its approval and that the other signatories also are prepared.to ratify the Treaty, we propose to advise His Majesty to ratify.As regards the Dominions, we have been proceeding on assumption that no obligation under Article 9 of the Treaty would in any event be undertaken by any Dominion Government unless the whole position had been laid before its Parliament and the approval of Parliament obtained. It has also seemed to us that, before arriving at any final judgment, Dominion Governments would desire the fullest possible information as to the situation created by the Treaty in relation to the whole field of foreign policy and defence.It would appear to follow that there should be a general examination of the whole situation, and we suggest that such examination could best be deferred, until there has been an opportunity of personal discussion between Ministers here and representatives of the Dominions and India, such as would be afforded by the next Imperial Conference, as to the date of which we hope to be able to make proposals in the near future.Similar message sent to other Prime Ministers.

We could hardly at this stage suggest a time for assembling if the latter[14153]* No. (1).
alternative were adopted, but if a meeting were arranged for next year, we think that the time might be either the middle of June or the beginning of October. Before, however, proceeding any further we should be glad to know your own views as to the most suitable date. I am sending a similar telegram to the other Prime Ministers.  Baldwin.

Your telegram of 21st December. * Following for Prime Minister from my Prime Minister.   Begins: Your message regarding Imperial Conference. While I recognise that there are several very important Empire matters to be dealt with by Imperial Conference and that it is desirable that its meeting should not be delayed unduly, there are several difficulties in the way of my attendance at a conference next year. A new Parliament has just been elected, and its first session will not begin in the ordinary course until the end of June next. It is essential that I should personally not be absent from New Zealand during this period. It is unnecessary to mention other obstacles in detail. It would therefore be more convenient to the New Zealand Government and myself if the conference was held in 1927. Coates.

Next Imperial Conference. Following for Prime Minister from my Prime Minister.   Begins: Your telegram of 21st December.* My Government very strongly of opinion that the Imperial Conference should be called in 1926, and, indeed, we cannot see how the same can be delayed. The Locarno Treaty has been hailed as the most important and far-reaching Treaty of recent years. The Australian people are waiting for some declaration from Government in regard to it. Official pronounce-ments from your Government have emphasised the importance of the Treaty and the necessity for an early Imperial Conference to discuss it. On the 18th of Novembert you cabled that it seemed to you that, before arriving at any final judgment, Dominion
Governments would desire the fullest possible information as to the situation created by the Treaty in relation to the whole field of foreign policy and defence. In the statement made in the House of Commons on that date the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it was recognised that only Dominion Governments acting with the approval of their Parliaments could undertake on their behalf the obliga-tions which His Majesty&apos;s Government asked the Imperial Parliament to undertake, and that your Government hoped to discuss matters with the Dominions at the next Imperial Conference, which should not be too long delayed. Further, that it was not thought possible to discuss questions of such importance and covering so wide a field by despatch or telegraph. These statements have received wide publicity, and naturally aroused considerable interest in the Treaty. To now put off the Conference until 1927 is to completely destroy this effect and create the impression that the Treaty is relatively unimportant, despite your Government&apos;s assurance to the contrary, and that the principle of consultation on such matters is a comparatively unimportant formality. My Government is convinced that only by personal con-sultation between Prime Ministers at the Imperial Conference can a basis for united Empire action in regard to the Locarno Treaty, which is vital, be arrived at which will be acceptable to and^ receive the endorsement of the Parliaments of the self-governing Dominions. Failing an Imperial Conference in June, various Parliaments will of necessity have to consider the attitude towards the Locarno Treaty with extreme probability of different decisions being arrived at which would present the appearance of disunity in the Empire on a fundamental and vital question. This most essential to avoid. As to the Treaty itself, from cables exchanged between us we are convinced that it is now and in its ultimate effect of paramount importance to the Dominions. Your telegram above quoted* suggests that it has created a new situation with regard to foreign policy and defence.These are the conclusions formed by my Government, and, indeed, we feel con-vinced that, as a direct and logical result of the Treaty, new proposals will be formulated in the direction of defence. Any such development, particularly in regard to naval limitations, is of vital interest to the whole Empire, and especially to those portions of the Empire contiguous to the Pacific. On such a matter we must be consulted.In short, we feel that the Locarno Treaty in itself is of sufficient importance to render an early Imperial Conference essential, and that it carries with it a suggestion of further development upon which it is imperative that the Empire should be consulted and speak with a single voice. The moral effect of a united Empire declaration in regard to these matters is, in our opinion, profound, and my Govern-ment considers that on every possible occasion the Empire should so speak. It is impossible to ignore the fact that the question of inter-Imperial consultation has reached a very interesting and delicate stage, and it is highly desirable in the interests of the Empire that the advances we have already made in this connection should be consolidated. To delay the Conference until 1927, especially when there are so many important matters to be discussed, would be a retrograde step of a most dangerous character. My Government therefore considers it is most desirable that an Imperial Conference should be held in June 1926, and trusts that it will be found possible to so arrange.

(received Dominions Office, 4-5 p.m., 9th January, 1926.) Confidential.  8th January.Following from Prime Minister for your Prime Minister.   Begins: Questions raised by signing of Treaty of Mutual Guarantee and other Locarno agreements, and in particular the proposals as to Imperial Conference contained in your telegrams of 18th November^ and 21st Decembert, have received the careful attention of Canadian Government.In examining Locarno agreements and reviewing the negotiations which led to their adoption, we have been impressed by the evident reasonableness and goodwill and frank facing of the realities which have marked the attitude of the repre-sentatives of all the Powers concerned. We have noted with particular pride the unceasing striving for peace and reconciliation in Europe and the skill and patience displayed by British Statesmen in recent years. Undertakings of France and Germany to accept their present frontiers and to renounce war in favour of arbitra-tion as means of settling future disputes, together with the Arbitration Agreement between Germany and her Eastern neighbours, should ensure new era of conciliation and co-operation among the Powers of Europe. Entrance of Germany into the League will remove one of the great stumbling blocks to its complete effectiveness.Question whether it was advisable or necessary for Great Britain to guarantee the settlement on the Western border is naturally one on which there is more room for difference of opinion. Canadian Government recognise the force of the considerations which led the British Government to conclude this question, while inevitably having important consequences for other parts of the Empire, was primarily matter of concern to Great Britain with which its Parliament and Govern-ment were best qualified to deal. Nor would we desire to take exception to the decision of the British Government, in view of these considerations and of the urgency which was held to exist, to determine its policy without consulting the Dominions in Imperial Conference or otherwise. Dominions have been furnished throughout with adequate summaries of all proposals and stages of the negotiations. It is noted also that, in accordance with precedent set in 1919 Tripartite Treaty after consultation with Dominion Prime Ministers, then in Paris, and followed in proposed Cannes Pact three years later, Article IX of the Treaty Of Mutual Guarantee provides that no
*obligation shall be imposed on any of the British Dominions or on India, unless its Government signifies acceptance, a procedure which of course implies real freedom of choice.As regards Canada, Canadian Government has not been able to conclude that it would be warranted in recommending Parliament to guarantee this European settlement. Considerations similar to those which have led the British Government to decide not to increase its obligations in the case of the Eastern boundaries of Germany appear to make it inadvisable for Canada to increase its obligations on either boundary. That such increase of obligations would be involved, appears from study of specific provisions as well as from the very fact of negotiation of the treaty and of the provision that it is not terminating until such time as two-thirds majority of the Council decide that ordinary engagements of the League afford adequate security. Such further undertakings would appear to run counter to the policy, consistently advocated both by the present Canadian Government and its predecessor, of endeavouring to secure more flexible interpretation of Article X of the Covenant. Instead of undertaking in advance to fight either on the side of France against Germany or on the side of Germany against France, as the case may be, in any future Rhine war, it appears advisable to leave the question of participation for determina-tion at the time in the light both of the situation abroad and the situation at home.Canadian Government has considered the suggestion that an Imperial Conference should be held for discussion of this question in 1926 or 1927, and. that such examination should precede any final judgment by a Dominion Government upon the matter. We agree that this question is such as may very profitably be considered in personal Conference when occasion permits. It is not apparent, however, that such a Conference is more essential to enable the Dominion Government to determine its policy after signature of the Treaty than it was for the British Government before signature. The Parliaments of the Dominions will be in possession of all information as to the Treaty and its bearing upon European affairs which was presented to the Parliament of Great Britain, and which was found adequate for reaching decisive judgment. The Canadian Government of course agrees with the views set forth in your telegram of 18th November* that it would undertake no obligation under Article IX. unless the whole position had been laid before Parliament and approval of Parliament obtained. Particularly in view of the fact that it may not be possible to arrange a date for Conference convenient for all the Governments concerned earlier than in 1927, it would not seem practicable or consistent with the responsibilities of Governments and Parliaments of the Dominions when the question is raised in Parliament, as it will inevitably be, to postpone an expression of opinion until after the Conference. While considering that it will probably be necessary therefore to provide for a discussion in Parlaiment, Canadian Government is quite prepared to maintain an open mind upon the question so that in case any change in present position or any consideration brought forward in discussion at the Imperial Conference gives ground for taking views other than that indicated above, corresponding action could then be recommended.As to the date of the next Imperial Conference, it is evident that the present parliamentary position in Canada makes it impossible to undertake to send representatives to a Conference in June of this year, and very uncertain whether they could be sent in October. So far as Canada is concerned early in October 1927 would at present appear most convenient time pending announcement by all the other Governments concerned of the dates they would prefer.

I note that replies now received from all Dominions with the exception of Canada. Apparently October of this year is generally acceptable time for the Conference, and this will be satisfactory to Australia.   Owing to the political situation, it would appear unlikely that a definite

In view however of the great iSLtan^e of the matter to the Dominions and the proximity of Canada to Great BrE my Government does not think it necessary to wait for such advice before Sdins^n the Conference. I suggest, therefore, that your Government makes annooinlement at an early date-that the Conference will be held. It will assist us Serially with regard to Queries, raised in connection with the Locarno Pact, which still command unabated interest in the House and Press.

(9).APPENDIX II.Attitude of Government of Union of South Africa to Locarno Pact.(Extract from &quot;Daily Telegraph,&quot; January 30, 1926.)Cape Town, Friday. In the House of Assembly to-day General Hertzog, replying to a question put by Mr. Nicholls regarding the Locarno Treaty, said : -&apos;&apos; The honourable member will recollect that the Locarno Treaty does not contain anything more about us than the statement that it is open to us also to sign this Treaty as guarantors, and that until we have signed it no obligation arising from it will rest on us. So far we have not received any definite request to sign it, although it is understood that, at least as far as Great Britain is con-cerned, our subscribing to it would be welcomed.&apos;&apos; As the Government of the Union has already been informed by the British Government that an Imperial Conference is about to be held, we must take it that it is the intention of the said Government to discuss this question fully at this Conference, and to submit to the Dominions a more complete statement, setting out in a more detailed form the circumstances of the whole question than has hitherto been possible, notwithstanding the praiseworthy manner in which the Government of the Union was informed during the whole course of the Locarno Conference.&quot;If I am correct in my surmise, the honourable member will at once recognise that it is the intention of the British Government that we shall be kept fully informed before any definite decision is arrived at by us, and such a decision will only be taken after joint consultation. I am of the opinion, therefore, that it would be neither advisable nor courteous towards the British Government for this Government to make any declaration as to its attitude in regard to the Locarno Treaty.&apos;&apos; For the same reason, I am of the opinion that it would not be desirable for this House at this stage to proceed to do anything which may anticipate or influence any resolution, as we are presumably not yet in possession of all the necessary information. I further wish to point out that, as far as the Union is concerned, a resolution of this House only can decide with binding effect whether or not the Locarno Treaty shall be signed by us. The House, therefore, in due course will have ample opportunity of discussing this far-reaching and important question.&apos;&apos; Renter.
