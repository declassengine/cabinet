CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,508(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT&apos; SECRET.     . Copy No.   *^&apos;C3CP. 64  (26 L --------CAB I N E memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.A question has arisen in connection with an appeal from the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State to His Majesty in Council, upon which I desire to have the views of the Cabinet,Under the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty dated the 6th December 1921,  and afterwards confirmed by Par-liament,  the law, practice and  constitutional usage governing the relationship; of the Crown to the Dominion of Canada is to  govern its relationship to the Irish Free State;  and this provision,   even if it stood alone, would preserve the prerogative right of the Crown to hear appeals from the courts of the Free State.    But the matter is made even more clor,r by Article 66 of the Irish Free State Constitution, which provides that the decision of the Supreme Court shall in all cases be final and conclusive, but adds:-&quot;Provided that nothing in this Constitutionshall impair the right, of any person to petitionHis Majesty for specisL leave to. appeal from theSupreme Court to His&apos; Majesty in Council or the rightof His Majesty to grant such leave1&apos;.A few weeks ago application was made to the Privy Council by the plaintiff in an action brought in the Courts of the Irish Free State (Lvman v, Butler) for leave to appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State to the King in Council.    The caL &apos;
507arose under the Land Aet 1923 of the Free State; and the question was whether certain land had or had not vested under that Act in the occupier.    Th   land had been leased by a life-tenant for her life, and after her death possession of. the land was claimed by the reyersicn-ary; but the lessee contended that, although the Appointed. day1  for the vesting of the land under the Act had not arrived,  the land had vested in him and could not be recovered.    The High Court decided in favour of the occupier (the defendant), and this decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court, one of the three judges dissenting.. On the application for leave to appeal coming before the Judicial Committee,  the Committee,  after a   short discussion on the Act, ware satisfied that there was a substantial, point for argument; and they were informed by Counsel for the appellant that the decision was one of great importance and affected a number of estates in the Irish Free State. The Committee accordingly advised that leave to appeal be granted ,The course taken by the Judicial Committee appears to have given umbrage to the Government of the Irish Free State, who have introduced and passed through the Dail a Bill of which the admitted intention is to prevent the appeal in Lyman^v^-^BlI-SS from becoming effective.    The Bill declares that the Land Act of 1923 &quot;shall be construed and have effect and be deemed. adways to have had effect&quot; as if certain words which are not to be found in the Act were inserted therein;    and there are other retrospective pro-visions which are intended to give legislative confirmation to the decision of the Supreme Court.    iBr,Kevin 05Higgins,
in introducing the Bill,  said that it was intended as a protest against the action of the Judicial Committee in giving leave to appeal in h.ym: n v,  Butler,      He in formed the Bail that in the discussion which took place at the time of the agreement for a Treaty there were very definite understandings end very definite assurances given that the preservation of the Prerogative would he more a theory than a fact,  and that the  practice so far as the Free State was concerned would be the practice observed in the case of South jifrica rather than in the case of certain other Dominions.     He suggested that this assurance had not been observed in granting leave  to appeal in the case of   hyman v. Butler, which (he said.) was a trumpery case of no importance.I understand that the  Bill has passed the hail and I think that it is now before  the Senate.Lord Panesfort has given notice that on Wednesday next he will call attention to the Bill and its effect on the right of appeal to  the privy Council,  and will ask His Majesty&apos;s Government what steps they propose to take in the matter,,I shall have no difficulty in dealing with the complaint made by Mr- 0TBiggins as to the action of the Judicial Committee,      I have madi enquiries and have seen the minutes of meetings which took place during the discussions which preceded    the Treaty; and I can find no confirmation of Mr 0&apos;Higgins&apos; statement that an assurance was given that the practice obtaining with regard to appeals from South Africa would be followed in the case of the Free State.      Hut this is of little importance,  as the practice is and will be in fact the same        in the case of both these Dominions,      The Free State, like  the Union of South Africa,  is a unitary State,  so that the questions
which so frequently arise in uanada as to the relation of the Dominion to the provinces will not arise for decision. Further, in the fi-ree State, as in south Africa,  there is no appeal as of right, and special leave to appeal must he obtained in each case.      in these circumstances,  there is no question that the practice followed by the Judicial Committee in South African cases -. namely, not to give leave unless some questions of grave importance *nd of general interest is raised, - should and will be followed in the case of appeals from the Free State.      whether a particular case falls within that description must, of course,  be determined bv the Judicial Committee itself.      In the present case the Committee thought the issue to be of sufficient importance  to justify leave  to appeal being given;, and I have no doubt that if a similar application had been made in a South African case, leave would have been granted.But the important question for decision is as to the action which should be taken with regard to the Bill. I have no doubt that the Government will be asked to request the Governor-General to reserve the Bill un&amp;er Article 41 of the Free State Constitution for the signification of the king1s pleasure;    but it does not appear to me that it would be wise to tfke this course.      Full power to legislate as to land in the Irish Free State hrs been granted to the Free State Parliament;    and although the proposals in the Bill may-appear unfair to the individual litigant in depriving him of a right of appeal to which ho is entitled,, that does not appear to be a sufficient reason for advising the refusal of the Royal Assent.     ho doubt the real purpose of the Bill is to prejudice  the right of appeal to Bis Majesty in Council, and if a similar course were followed with regard to other appeals it might be necessary to take action;    but that time
510has not yet arrived.      II the noyal Assent were refused to the present Bill, an agitation would at once arise in Ireland for the total abolition of the right of appeal to the king in Council and the agitation might react on other Dominions of the Cr own,C.25.2.26,
