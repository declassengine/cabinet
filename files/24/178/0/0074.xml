CONFIDENTIAL JJBRARYL 135(This dooument is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government).SECRET .CABINET .CP.73 (26).REPORT OF THE LUXURY TAX COMMITTEEL Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1 have been carefully considering the proposals for a tax on betting limited to credit bookmakers and to cash book-makers on race-courses.      In my view this scheme will.h3.ve two results.     First,  it will divert much of the credit business to Holland where a bookmaker being free from tho proposed tax will be able to give longer odds.      Secondly, it will tend to the further increase of street betting, since the illicit bookmaker will be able to give better terms to his clients than the credit cr race-course book-maker .The difficulty which the Police already experience in dealing with street betting is laregly due to the fact that public opinion is not with them.      The public conscience can see no moral difference between street betting and betting at Ladbrookes or at Ascot.      Consequently the Police get no information from the public and are in fact rather thwarted than helped in their efforts to suppress street betting.The overt recognition by the Government of credit betting and place betting will tend to confirm the general view that the harrying of street bookmakers is unjustifiable and to mako Police action still more difficult.     At the same time the number and activities of such street bookmakers will be increased by the financial advantage which the tax will give to the illicit over the recognised bookmaker.
17th February, 1926.It is, however, essential that the Police Authorities shall do their utmost to enforce the law, and it will be my duty as Home Secretary to do all I oan to support their efforts.     But if the position created by the tax makes a greater call on the efforts of the Police, that call oan only be met by increasing the strength of the Police Forces, and I think it right to warn my colleagues that this result may have to be faced.W.J.H.
