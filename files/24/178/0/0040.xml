[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]MOST SECRET. Copy No.   38  2 &amp; 6CP. 39 (26).CABINET.LUXURY TAX COMMITTEE.REPORT.(1.) Under the existing law Credit Betting is legal everywhere, and Cash Betting is illegal everywhere except on a race course. Cash Betting oh&apos; a race course is commonly called Street Betting and is repressed as far as possible by the Police. The legal betting by credit or on a race course accounts for at least 85 per cent, of the whole turnover. The illegal or Street Betting is estimated at 15 per cent., but the Customs think this is probably too high.(2.) The proposal to tax Betting has always hitherto been argued on the basis that all forms of betting, legal and illegal, credit, race course and street betting, must equally be recognised, legalised and taxed by the State. On this assumption it would be necessary to legalise Cash Betting everywhere, to register the present street book-makers and to allow them to open betting offices either wherever they pleased or to whatever extent might be considered necessary by the State to meet the requirements of particular districts. The proposal therefore encounters at the very outset the grievous obstacle of the legalisation of what is now illegal, and the setting up under the aegis of the State of numerous betting offices in working class districts where cash book-makers would discharge their present forbidden traffic.(3.) There is no doubt that such a proposal would excite very serious oppositions. The argument that at present there is one law for the rich and another for the working man sounds very well, but it would not stand against the protests which would certainly be made by the official Labour Party, the Trade Unions, the Nonconformists, the Churches and the great majority of those Institutions and individuals engaged in social and philanthropic effort among the people. All these bodies would say : &quot; We do not approve of betting, and we will resist any proposal to facilitate its spread among the working classes.&quot; This also is the view of the Home Office, who say with force that the law, though in appearance inconsistent and inequitable, has nevertheless striven constantly to repress betting as[14146] b
2far as possible and particularly in those quarters where it is most mischievous. We are all of opinion that, if the legalisation of Street Betting is indispensable to a tax oh betting, the Government would be ill advised to entertain such a project.(4.) We have therefore proceeded to enquire whether a tax limited exclusively to betting which is now legal is practicable, and what are the remaining objections which could be urged against it. Having heard the opinion of the Customs, we are satisfied that there is no mechanical difficulty in collecting such a tax. It would indeed be easy and inexpensive to collect the great bulk of it from the credit book-makers, who have large, offices and elaborate telephone services, and are substantial people conducting business on a very extensive scale. Moreover, the House of Commons Committee considered that a tax of 2-1 per cent, would be the maximum that could at the outset safely be imposed upon the present illegal street book-maker without leading him to prefer the present illegality of the streets to taxed recognition in a betting office. But once the street book-maker&apos; passes out of the picture, there would be no difficulty in collecting a 5 per cent, tax from the credit book-makers, and no more difficulty in collecting 5 per cent, than 2\ per cent, on the race courses. The financial yield of a 5 per cent, tax limited to the 85 per cent, of legal betting would be greater than the yield of a 2-^ per cent, tax which covered the whole field.(5.) Sir Henry Cautley (the Chairman of the House of Commons Committee) believes that the turnover on which tax would be levied amounts to at least  200 millions a year, 5 per cent, on which is  10 millions. Deducting the 15 per cent, for the street book-maker which it is proposed to forgo, this would leave  170 millions, on which a 5 per cent, tax would yield  8J millions. The Customs, while adopting and indeed supplying the  200 million basis as the only one available, consider that a further deduction of  50 millions should be made to allow for reduction in betting due to the tax, laid-off bets by book-makers, evasions, &amp;c, leaving a taxable turnover of  120 millions. A 5 per cent, tax on this sum would yield  6 millions in a full year. This is an important contribution to the Revenue.(6.) It is to be observed that by confining our action within the present legal limits the more serious oppositions are avoided. There would be no alteration in the law about betting. There would be no extension of its legality. What is now legal would be taxed; what is now illegal would be repressed as at present. There would be no betting houses with the scandals which might possibly attach to them. Betting facilities beyond what at present prevail would not be brought to the notice of any class of people; and no sanction of respectability would be accorded to the operations of the street book-maker or backer. There would of course be no alteration in the non-recoverability of bets by law. Indeed it could be argued that a tax on betting so limited was essentially and wholly an anti-gambling measure; that street betting was repressed by the Police
and race course betting taxed by the Customs. It could no doubt be urged that the existing invidious distinction between working class and credit betting was pro tanto reduced by the application of a new form of discouragement to credit betting.(7.) : The present evil of street betting and the existing anomalies of the law ,would not be removed. The contempt into which the law is brought wiren its enforcement is not supported by public opinion, the elaborate organisation for breaking the law which street book-makers have developed, the alleged occasional corruption of the Police and their many admitted difficulties in repressing street betting would still continue as they do at present. These conditions would not be bettered, and in consequence a certain amount of popular support and argument would be withdrawn from the tax. Neither, hoAvever, except in one particular to which we shall refer later, would they be worsened. The Exchequer would be seeking revenue and not attempting to deal with a very controversial topic of public morals It would be seeking revenue where the overwhelming bulk of it lies and where it can easily be found, and leaving the rest exactly as law, practice and malpractice have created it.(8.) It must be remembered that every conceivable method of taking money from people is open to valid objection and arouses keen resistance. A permanent addition of  6 millions to our strained revenues is worth winning. It cannot be judged in isolation; it must be contrasted with other alternatives for acquiring the same sum, as well as with the reliefs both to direct and indirect taxpayers which such an increase to the Revenue might render possible. Nevertheless, we feel bound to state the various remaining objections (serious or minor) which could be urged against a Betting Tax even upon a limited basis.(9.) Nearly all betting legal and illegal alike-is done on starting prices. These starting prices would be fixed by the dominant credit and race course book-makers. If they had to bear a 5 per cent, tax they would rightly shorten the odds so as to pass the burden on to their clients. The illegal street book-maker, on the other hand, would give the same shortened odds, would not pay the tax, and would put the difference in his pocket. Thus it would be argued that street book-making would become more lucrative, the temptation and the resources of those who indulged in it greater, and that consequently the scale of their operations and the many evils attendant upon them would be extended.If a tax is placed on legal betting, shall we not be committed in all probability to take further steps in the near future in order to deal with the present anomalous position ? Shall we not be asked either to regularise street betting or to suppress it&apos;( The objections to the licensing of street bookmaking have been fully stated. We must also recognise the practical impossibility of suppressing it. The safeguards by which street book-makers are&quot;surrounded make it impossible for the police to arrest the activities of the great majority of those engaged in it.   Public opinion,[14146] b 2
moreover, might well resent further powers being given to the police as regards street-betting, whilst the State was regulating betting in other forms for the purpose of taxation. If, therefore, a decision in favour of a tax on legal betting is taken, it must be done with full knowledge of the consequences, and with a clear agreement as to what is to be our course, if challenged to deal in one way or the other with illegal betting.(10.) We do not believe that there would be any transference of clientele on account of the tax from the present legal credit book-makers to the illegal street book-makers. The social conditions and the scale of the wagers are too different, and it is unreasonable to suppose that a 5 per cent, tax would induce an habitual credit backer to exchange the convenient and respectable facilities of credit betting for the harassed, precarious and petty illegal gambling of the streets. Neither the habits of the credit clientele nor the yield of the tax would be appreciably affected by any transference.(11.) We have found ourselves unable to measure with any certainty what the effect of a 5 per cent, tax on legal betting would be upon the volume of betting. Every factor is speculative and disputable. No estimate can be formed of the amount of new money put into betting every year. Some hold that the amount is comparatively small and that a tax operating on every stake would take from the same new money over and over again, thus exercising a serious deterrent on Credit Betting and reducing its volume. If this were so, it might disappoint the Exchequer, but it would not expose the Government to political embarrassment. The First Lord of the Admiralty on the above grounds would prefer a 2-J per cent, tax at the&apos; outset.(12.) In this connection it is suggested that there is a small class of professional racing men or small owners of race horses, rnany of whom radiate from Newmarket, who make a scientific business of betting on their special stable knowledge, that they make very small profits on a large turn-over and many operations, that they use these small profits as a means of paying the expenses of keeping race horses, that the tax by its cumulative effect would reduce or even obliterate these profits and would consequently react injuriously upon horse racing. It should, however, be mentioned that Lord D&apos;Abernon, a high authority on racing, and many other large owners of race horses are strongly in favour of the tax.(13.) It is contended in other quarters that the great majority of the owners of race horses do not depend for their participation in the sport upon the profits of judicious betting. The public bet not with the hopes of making a steady income which indeed would seem rather an illusory hope but for excitement or at least amusement. They indulge in a luxury for which, in the great majority of cases, they can afford to pay. They would not be deterred from betting by having to accept adds shortened sufficiently to equate a shilling in the pound. They would put up the extra new money rather than be deprived of their deplorable but delectable diversion.
(14.) In accordance with the request of the Cabinet, the Committee have considered the possibility of using totalisators, but they are agreed that no solution to the problem of a betting tax could be found by this means. They are of opinion, however, that no objection need be raised to the use of totalisators on race courses where desired.(15.) We conceive that we have now placed the Cabinet in a position to judge as well as possible this question which is so peculiarly one of personal opinion. The Chancellor of the Exchequer definitely asks for Cabinet authority to include, should the financial situation render it desirable, a 5 per cent, tax on all Betting that is at present legal, in his forthcoming Budget proposals. We are of opinion that, provided no alteration is made in the law affecting Betting, and no form of gambling is rendered legal which is now illegal, there is no insuperable political or moral reason against such authority being given.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, February 4, 1926.Note by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.I DISAGREE with the opinion expressed in the last paragraph as to the political effect of the proposed tax.I believe that a tax on legal betting would entail considerable political disadvantages both from the annoyance caused to those who bet, and from the hostility of those who would fear an increase of street betting. I further believe that the proposed discrimination by taxation between legal and illegal betting could not be maintained, and that the Government would soon be driven either to legalise and tax street betting, or to attempt its suppression, and that either of these courses would have serious political results among opposing, but equally important, sections of opinion.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL (Chairman). W. C. BRIDGEMAN. ARTHUR STEEL-MAITLAND. DOUGLAS McGAREL HOGG.W. G.February 4, 1926.
