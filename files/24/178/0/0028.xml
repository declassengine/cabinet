[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1926.SECRET. Copy No.   3^CP. 27 (26).CABINET.HOUSE OE LORDS REFORM  COMMITTEE.REPORT.AT their Meeting on the 17th June, 1925 (Cabinet 29 (25), Conclusion 2), the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor on the subject of House of Lords Reform (CP. 148 (25)), and agreed that this question should be referred to a Cabinet Committee.The Committee was constituted as follows : The Lord Chancellor (in the Chair).The Lord Privy Seal.The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Home Secretary.The Secretary of State for India.The Secretary of State for Air.The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries.*The Eirst Commissioner of Works.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.They have been furnished with full information as to the conclusions of former Committees on the same subject, and as to the constitution of the Second Chambers in the Dominions and abroad. They have also had the advantage of discussions with representatives of the Committees of Unionist peers and Members of Parliament which had been formed to consider the matter.2. The Committee are satisfied that there exists in the Unionist Party a strong and widespread feeling in favour of an amendment of the Parliament Act. Under that Act a Bill which has been certified by the Speaker of the House of Commons to be a Money Bill cannot be either amended or rejected by the House of Lords; and any other Bill (including a Bill making radical changes in the Constitution), if passed three times by the House of Commons, even in one Parliament, must, though rejected by the House of Lords, be submitted for the Royal Assent. It is obvious that, if these provisions remain law, it will be in the power of a Socialist majority in the House of Commons to carry subversive and, indeed, ruinous changes in the Constitution and social order of the country, without any check on the part of the Second Chamber or of the electors; and most Unionists hold the view that it is the duty of the present Government to provide a safeguard against that danger. On the other hand, a repeal or virtual repeal of the Parliament Act would not (the Committee believe) be generally acceptable to the party or to the country, and the object in view can best be attained by grafting amendments onto the framework of that Act.3. As to Money Bills, it is probably useless to expect that the House of Commons, however constituted, will consent to abandon its paramount control over Bills of a purely financial character; but the provision of the Parliament Act which leaves the decision as to what Bills are of that character to the Speaker of the House of Commons alone, is plainly indefensible. The Bryce Conference recognised the justice of this view, and recommended that the question whether a Bill is or is not purely financial should be dealt with by a Joint Standing Committee of the two* Lord Irwin ceased to be a member of the Committee on November 3, 1925. [14008] b
2Houses, not to exceed in number seven members from each House, and to be set up at the&apos; beginning of each Parliament. &quot;Such an arrangement,&quot; they said, &quot;for deciding these delicate questions seemed preferable to that contained in the Parliament Act, which does not cover all the cases likely to arise, and which places on the Speaker responsibilities with which it is not desirable to load an office whose perfect impartiality everyone desires to preserve.&quot; They added a recommendation that Bills and provisions dealing with local rates should not be held to fall within the category of financial Bills or financial provisions, and that the Second Chamber should have power to deal with matters affecting local rates. These proposals, which have received the approval of a Conference upon which both Houses and all parties were represented, may well be accepted as a settlement of this part of the question.4. The attention of the Committee was drawn to the fact that in some cases Bills, financial in form but involving new principles of legislation such as the Elementary Education Fee Grant Bill, 1918, the Disabled Men (Facilities for Employment) Bill, 1919, the Housing (Scotland) Bill, 1921, the Safeguarding of Industries Bill, 1921, and the War Charges Validity Bill, 1925 had been certified as Money Bills; and it was suggested that a new definition of a Money Bill, which would prevent the passing of new and drastic legislation under the guise of finance without the assent of the Second Chamber, was required. The Committee found difficulty in framing a restrictive definition which would be likely to meet with acceptance in the House of Commons; but they are of opinion that the legislation now to be proposed should contain some direction which will enable the new Committee on Money Bills to exercise a discretion on this point without reference to previous decisions. They propose therefore that it should be enacted that the Committee on Money Bills, in deciding whether a Bill shall or shall not be certified as a Money Bill, shall henceforth have regard not only to the form but to the substance and effect of the Bill.5. As to Bills other than Money Bills, the question to be determined is how differences between the two Houses with regard to such Bills should be adjusted. The Bryce Conference suggested that such differences should be referred to a free Conference of representatives of both Houses, and that if the Free Conference ultimately failed to agree the decision of the House of Commons should prevail,  thus leaving untouched the main defect in the present system. The proposals which are sometimes made for the reference of disputed Bills to a joint session of both Houses are equally open to objection; and, having fully considered the various proposals, the Committee have arrived at the conclusion that in the case of a definite and obstinate difference between the two Houses on a Bill other than a Money Bill, it should be in the power of the parliamentary electors to decide whether the Bill shall or shall not become law. Where a General Election intervenes between the first rejection of such a Bill by the House of Lords and its second or third passing by the House of Commons and results in the retention in power of the Government responsible for the Bill, that result may well be taken as marking an approval by the electors of the Governments proposals; and in that event the Parliament Act may safely remain in full force, so that on a third passing of the Bill by the House of Commons it may be submitted (as now) for the Royal Assent, But there is a natural reluctance to multiply general elections, and a Government may be unwilling to postpone the passing of its Bill until an election can conveniently be taken; and in such a case it should (the Committee think) be in the power of the Government, after a Bill has been twice passed by the House of Commons and rejected by the House of Lords, to take a poll of the parliamentary electors (or referendum) upon the question whether the Bill shall or shall not pass. If the answer is in the affirmative, the Bill should at once, on the passing by the House of Commons of a resolution to that effect, be submitted for the Royal Assent; but if the decision should be in the negative, the Bill should fall to the ground.6. The Committee are well aware that a not inconsiderable body of Unionists have been opposed to the adoption of the referendum, on the ground that its use might be extended, and that if generally used it would tend to lower the authority of Parliament. The Committee do not undervalue this objection, but they are satisfied that it is outweighed by the great advantages attaching to the referendum as a means of settling differences between the two Houses. It can be most effectively advocated on the platform as committing the final decision on any constitutional change or other great question, not to a majority of the House of Commons, which may have no mandate on the question, but. to the general body of electors from whom the authority of that House is derived.   It has the further advantage that, while inMRMIB
a general election the relative value of each individual vote is conditioned by the size of the constituency in which it is exercised and by the possible splitting of the party vote, all votes would on a referendum have an equal value. The application of a referendum would be confined to the case of a continued difference between the Houses and could not be extended to other cases except by legislation; and it would surely not be more injurious to the dignity of Parliament than that the Speaker of one House should override the other. It should be added that both the representatives of the Committee of Unionist peers and the representatives of the Committee of Unionist Members of the House of Commons, with whom your Committee conferred, stated that the great majority of those for whom they spoke were in favour of the referendum.7. The question next to be considered is whether the above proposals for the amendment of the Parliament Act should be accompanied by proposals for a change in the composition of the House of Lords. In the opinion of the Committee, this question should be answered in the affirmative. It appears to be the almost universal opinion of those Unionists who have considered the matter that Parliament would not consent to increase the authority of the House of Lords by empowering it to compel an appeal to the electors, except on the terms of some reform being made in the constitution of that House. It is admittedly too numerous, it is almost wholly hereditary, and the relatively small attendance of its members (as evidenced by the return which accompanies this Eeport as Appendix A) is an occasion for frequent criticism. The very representative deputation of Unionist peers who conferred with the Committee expressed the opinion that the present House of Lords would not object to a considerable change in the composition of that House if by consenting to such a change they succeeded in protecting the country against the grave risks now inherent in the Parliament Act.8. As to the nature of the change which ought to be made, the proposals which have been put forward are infinite in their number and variety; but the Committee, after full consideration, have arrived at the following conclusions : (1.) The House of Lords should continue to bear that name and should consist of (a) the peers ol the Blood Royal, the Lords Spiritual (in reduced numbers) and the Law Lords, including the Lord Chancellor and ex-Lord Chancellors and peers who hold or have held high judicial office; (6) a strong representation of the hereditary peerage, which should con-stitute about one-half of the Second Chamber; (c) a body of members chosen by some method of indirect election; and (d) a smaller number of members nominated by the Crown. In each case the term of office should be twelve years, but one-third of the members in each category should vacate office at the end of every four years and should be re-eligible.(2.) The representative peers should number about 150, and should be elected by their own order and by the method of proportional representation known as the limited vote; but for this purpose Scotland, Wales (with Monmouthshire) and Northern Ireland should be separate electoral areas, each peer voting in the area in which he usually resides. Peers of Scotland or Ireland and peeresses in their own right should stand on the same footing as peers of the United Kingdom.(3.) The elected members should number about 100. As to the manner in which they should be chosen, there is room for much difference of opinion, but upon the whole the Committee think that a system based on the existing units of county government would be the most likely to secure a suitable choice. Accordingly, they propose that for this purpose the country shall be divided into a small number of electoral areas (say ten in all), that in each such area there shall be formed an electoral council consisting of persons chosen (in pro-portion to population) by the county and count)&apos;&apos; borough councils having jurisdiction in the area, and that the elected members shall be chosen by such councils. Such an electoral council would naturally consist of persons having experience of public service and held in high regard in their several localities, and the Committee are satisfied that they would make a good selection. It is not proposed to limit their choice to persons resident in the area. A possible scheme of division, which is intended for illustration only, is annexed as Appendix B.(4.) In connection with the proposal for local electoral councils, the Cabinet may be reminded that proposals for a devolution to local councils of some [14008]&quot; B 2
4of the powers of Parliament have long been under consideration, and a scheme for that purpose was proposed by the&apos; Conference on Devolution over which Mr. Speaker Lowther presided [Cd. 692 of 1920]. The electoral councils now proposed to be formed might in tune become the basis of such a scheme of devolution.(5.) The proposal that a limited number of members of the Second Chamber should be nominated by the Crown was originally made by Lord St. Aldwyn to the Select Committee of 1907, and it has many advantages. The appointment would, of course, be made on the advice of the Govern-ment of the day; and a Labour Government would naturally recommend for appointment a substantial number of members of the Labour Party, including Labour Ministers. A Conservative Government, being already well represented in the House of Lords, would be likely to include representatives of Labour among its nominees; and the list might comprise representatives of other national interests and of the Dominions. The number of nominated members should not exceed fifty.(8.) Peers not elected to the House of Lords should be eligible for the House of Commons; and as under any scheme of reform the hereditary peers would be asked to surrender their existing constitutional right to take part in legislation, it would be reasonable to provide that a peer who is not elected to either House shall be entitled to attend and speak in the House of Lords, but not to vote.9. With regard to the manner in which these proposals, if accepted by the Cabinet, should be presented to Parliament, the Committee think that it would be desirable in the first instance to introduce them in the House of Lords in the form of resolutions. If the resolutions are accepted by that House with or without amendment, it will be time to consider whether and at what time a Bill or Bills for giving effect to them should be introduced.10. It only remains to add that, while the conclusions of this Report represent the general opinion of the Committee, some of its members subscribe to certain of the resolutions with considerable hesitation. To them it appears that a Second Chamber constituted in the manner proposed must almost certainly be Conservative in its opinions, and that to such a body the country might be unwilling to entrust the power of forcing a strong democratic Government to put its proposals to the hasard of a popular vote. They would therefore prefer that for the present the Government should confine itself to proposing (a) the setting up of a new Committee as to Money Bills, and (b) an enactment that the Parliament Act shall not be altered by its own machinery without the intervention of a General Election. But to the majority of your Committee it seems clear that these proposals would neither satisfy the expectations of the Unionist party nor afford to the House of Lords a sufficient inducement to submit that House to a process of drastic reform.11.   The Committee submit the folloAving recommendations : (A.) Powers of the House of Lords.(1.) The decision as to whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill within the meaning of the Parliament Act, 1911, or is partly a Money Bill and partly not a Money Bill, shall be referred to a j oint Standing Committee of the two Houses, whose decision shall be final. The Joint Standing Committee shall be appointed at the beginning of each new Parliament and shall be composed of seven members of each House. The Joint Standing Committee shall choose their own chairman, who either may be one of their own body, in which case he shall have a second or casting vote, or may be chosen from outside from members of either House of Parliament, in which case he shall vote only when the voices are equal. In coming to their decision the Joint Standing Committee shall hence-forth have regard not only to the form, but to the substance and effect of the Bill.(2.) Bills dealing with local rates shall not be deemed to be Money Bills, and the House of Lords shall have power to deal with matters affecting local rates.(3.) The provisions of the Parliament Act, 1911, under which a Bill other than a Money Bill, which has been three times passed by the House of&apos; Commons, may be passed into law without the consent of the House of
Lords, shall not have effect unless a general election shall have intervened between the first passing of the Bill by the House of Commons and the third passing of the Bill by that House.Provided that at any time within six months after a Bill other than a Money Bill shall, have been twice passed by the House of Commons and rejected by the House of Lords in manner described in the Parliament Act, His Majesty in Council may order that a poll of the parliamentary electors shall be taken upon the question whether the Bill shall or shall not become law, and thereupon such poll shall be taken in manner to be determined by statute, and if a majority of the votes cast&apos;at such poll shall have been cast in favour of the Bill, then, if the House of Commons shall by resolution so direct, the Bill shall be forthwith presented for the Royal Assent, but otherwise it shall cease to be subject to the provisions of the Parliament Act.(B.) Constitution of the House of Lords.(1.) The House of Lords shall be composed, in addition to Peers of the Blood Royal, Lords Spiritual and Law Lords, of approximately (a.) 150 Peers elected by their order;(6.) 100 members elected by county electoral councils; and (c.) 50 members nominated by the Crown;the precise numbers in each case to be determined by statute. For the purpose of the election of peers by their own order, Scotland, Wales (with Monmouthshire) and Northern Ireland shall be separate areas. A peer shall be entitled to vote in the area in which he usually resides, and in the event of his having a residence in more than one area he shall elect in which area he will vote. Peers of Scotland or of Ireland, and peeresses in their own right, shall be entitled to vote and be eligible in the same manner as peers of the United Kingdom. The election shall be by a method of proportional representation to be determined by statute.For the purpose of the constitution of county electoral councils, Scotland, Wales (with Monmouthshire) and Northern Ireland shall be separate electoral areas and England shall be divided into areas of sufficient size: and the electoral council for each area shall consist of persons appointed (in proportion to population) by the county and county borough councils having jurisdiction in the area. The term of office of the persona so appointed to sit on the county electoral councils shall be four years. Each of the elected and nominated members of the House of Lords shall be appointed for a term of twelve years. One-third of the members of each class shall vacate his office at the end of each period of four years, but shall be eligible for re-election or reappointment. Peers who are not members of the House of Lords shall be eligible for membership of the House of Commons. Peers who are not members of either House shall be entitled to attend and speak in the House of Lords, but not to vote.Signed on behalf of the Committee,. CAVE, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.
