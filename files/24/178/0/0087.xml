CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,.       515/THIS LOCIMEHT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS gjgt^J^^ ) .SJ^OJLl&apos; COPYlp^i/l0 A B I NET.---1--VCP.  86  (26), &quot;*      &apos;LAW OE PROPERTY f AM -HTJvCEgTjn BILL,Memorandum by the Lord Chancell or. I circulate herewith a draft of a Bill which I-am anxious to introduce immediately into the House of Lords aThe main object of the Bill is to cure two technical defects in the Acts which came into operation on the 1st January last Consolidating Lord Birkenhead * s La-./ of Property Act of 19S2 with the existing lew upon the subject&quot;The first of these defects is producing some anxiety, particularly in Bournemouth and near Ilfordi      The effect of the Aot is that, where land comprised in a settlement which was subject to an overriding yearly rent charge has been sold to a purchaser with an indemnity against the charge, the land (which is still technically affeoted by the charge) is deemed to be settled land and cannot be re-sold without the appointment of trustees to receive the purchase money.     A good deal of land has been,  or is likely to be, dealt with in this way,  and it is said that the provisions of the Act are hampering the - sale cr further development of building land, and the employment of labour-      It is necessary that this state of things should be brought to an end at the earliest moment possible, and for this purpose it is necessary that legislation should be introduced and passed into law without delsy.The second important point relates to the position of such Corporations as the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, the London County Council,  and certain bodies which   act as trustees
for the real property belonging to certain of the Non-Conformist bodies.      The operations of these bodies in dealing with their property are hampered by the salutary provision of the Act which requires that not less than two trustees should, except in certain exceptional cases,  join in dealings with trust property..      It is proposed to except them from this general provision.Advantage is being taken of this opportunity to deal with a few minor matters in which Inconvenience is or is likely to be felt-     Hone of the provisions of the Bill are other than technical or touch even remotely any controversial issue.CHouse of Lords,26th February,  1926.
