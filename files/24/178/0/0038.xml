1.9 7fcllS DOOTEKT IS TEE&apos;lftOP]ffiT jDF-parts of Scotland, particularly in the Northern and Western Counties and in the Islands, to enforce tho decrees of the Courts.    This hindrance to the effective admini strati on of justice is due to the very marked decline which has taken place during the last 50 years in the numbers of Messengers-at-Arms, and Sheriff Officers, who alone under existing statutes can competently take certain of the cteus necessary to enforce or execute judgments of the Court of Session and the Sheriff Court.2. The Bill gives effect to the recommendations of a departmental Committee which wa3 appointed by the Secretary for Scotland in 1922 in response to representations by legal bodies, and which has thoroughly explored the situation.   The main remedies proposed are an extension of the use of registered letters for the execution of certain processes and the giving of power to the Sheriff, when he 13 satisfied that no messenger-at-&apos;arms or Sheriff Officer is reasonably available, to appoint any suitable person to execute a decree or warrant,3. The recommendations of the Committee have been- received with approval in Scotland and I do not anticipate that there will&quot;do any material opposition to the Bill.   No charge on government funds is involved,   I shall be glad to have the consent of my colleagues to the introduction of the Bill in the coming Session &quot;with a view to its early passage into law.fcCRET.SP..57 (25),HOME AFFAIRS COMffiTTEE.EXECUTION OP DILIGENCE IN SCOTLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.;J0HN&apos;GILM0uBV,&apos;tMsh Office, Whitehall, S.Y3rd February, 1925.
