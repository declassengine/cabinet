LAxfl) DRAIHAQIS BILL, iieawrandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.Ike accompanying Bill has been drafted as the result of applications received from nearly every county Council in England and Wales, from the County Councils Association, and of resolutions passed by the council of Agriculture, in favour of County Councils being equipped Tilth greater powers as regards land drainage.The Bill does not go as far as the County Councils Association and others wish, but It has received the approval of the County Councils Association and the Council of Agriculture and to that extent may be said to he generally oomaendable to the industry of agriculture.     Any opposition will probably be In the direction of asking for greater powers, but tills will be resisted, as I foresee the necessity of introducing sooner or later legislation amending the whole law of land drainage.In the first place the Bill proposes (Clause 1) to transfer wholly to County Councils or County Borough Councils certain powers existing under the Land Drainage Act of 1913, which I say be delegated by the Ministry to County Councils. These powers have uitncrto been practically a dead letter, because it was necessary in the first   instance for the funds to be found by the Treasury.     The transfer of these powers wholly to County and County Borough Councils will throw on those Counolls the &quot;burden of finding the initial funds required, which are recoverable later from the owners concerned.
These powers are of two kinds.     First, County Councils will be enabled to oarry out compulaorily small schemes of land drainage in areas where a drainage authority cannot conveniently be set up, and secondly they will be empowered 3.nt;er alia to assume the powers of an existing land drainage authority where such an authority is not oarrying out Its duties properly.     It is hoped, however, that one effect of this Clause will be to encourage local authorities to continue without Government grants the schemes which they have during the past five years been carrying out with Government grants as unemployment relief works *Clauses 2 and following do not amend in any way the Act of 1918, but represent a new departure so far as that Act is concerned.     Under these clauses the County Council will be empowered to require an owner or occupier to clear out his ditches if he is in effect causing flooding owing to the existence of an obstruction.     This power has been widely asked for and is based on a power already incorporated in the Lancashire County Council Drainage Act and the V.:est Riding Drainage Act.     With a view to protect owners and occupiers from any unfair use of this power wide powers of appeal are provided.I hope the Committee will recommend to the Cabinet the early Introduction of this Bill.     If considered desirable the BUI might be first presented in the House of Lords.EftMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 5th February, 1926.
