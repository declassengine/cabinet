CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY.THIS DOCUMENT IS Tlffi PROPERTY OF KIS BRITASHIO JJ&apos;IAJESIY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.0 A B I K E I,HEfflRASDUIi BY THE MINISTER OB1 LABOUR. ElTJEREATIOKAL REGULATION OP HOURS OF WORK.1;secret,?,0,P, 17(26). The Cabinet will remember that in Hay last I submitted proposals aimed at the oalling of a conference in London of representatives of certain foreign Governments to oonsider the possibility      of securing an effeotive international agreement for regulating hours of work in Industry.I need not trouble my colleagues by reoapitulating the history of the Washington Hours Convention and the attitude of this oountry towards it, but I might remind them that one of the faotors that led me to put forward these proposals was an apparently growing realisation on the part of those responsible for seme of our most important Industries of the fact that the longer hours, worked by their competitors abroad, oonstituted one of the chief obstacles to their obtaining an adequate volume of business In the world&apos;s markets.Following upon the Cabinet!s approval of the prinoiplo on whioh my proposals were based, informal conversations took place with the Ministers of Labour of Franoe and Germany, and In June I circulated to them and also to the competent Ministers of Belgium and Italy a letter explaining what 1 had in mind and a memorandum setting out the chief points on which a satisfactory solution seemed essential. A copy of the letter and its enclosure form Appendix I to this memorandum.     It will be seen that the letter stated plainly that In my view the holding of a oonforenoe would only be justified if the replios of tho various Governments indicated the existence of a substantial prospoot of agreement being reached on the points contained in the memorandum.The replies of all four Governments have now been received, (oopies attaohod Appendix II) and while it is clear that the proposed conference will be faced with a large number of points of difficulty, some of whioh may even prove to beisreooncilablo, no reasons have in my opinion emerged that would justify a decision not to proceed to the convocation of the conference./Before^,
Before, however, such a conference is held it will be necessary to obtain the viows of tho leaders of industry in this oountry, both employers and employed.     Already steps have bean taken informally to bring the matter to the notioe of tho National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations.     If the Cabinet agree to the oalling of the conference, a more formal approaoh will be made to the Confederation and a similar approaoh to the Trades Union Congress Genercl Council, in order that the views of both sides oonoerned in industry may be obtained in as authoritative- form a3 possible.At tfee conference it would be my intention to adhere to the main principles expressed in my letter and memorandum of June last, namely, the necessity for uniform Interpretation and for effective enforcement, ooiapled with adequate statistical reports on the working of the legislation involved. &quot;   Subsidiary but important points are, the cloar definition of what is meant by hours of work, the regulation of overtime on some clear basis, agreement upon the processes that oan be regarded as necessarily continuous, upon the trades to which the rigid eight hour day and forty-eight hour.week oannot be applied, and upon the circumstances in whioh general suspension can be allowed.   I should also propose to press for a straight-forward and impartial consideration of the position of railways in relation to the Convention.I therefore invite my colleagues to give me authority to issuo to the four Governments concerned and to the Director of the International Labour Office (to whom a copy of my memorandum was sent for his confidential information) invitations to a conference in London to deal with this matter, and to instruct my representative to inform the Governing Body of the International Labour Offioe next week at Geneva that invitiations are being Issued.(Intd. ) A.

APPEND IX    I.102Letter and Memorandum circulated by Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland to the Ministers of Labour of Belgium, Prance, Germany and Italy.Note: The following letter is that actuallyaddressed to the Minister of Labotir for Belgium. The other letters were identical subject to such alterations as wero necessary to meet the.circum-stances of each individual government.I.L. 166/1925.29th June, 1925.Dear Minister,It will probably have come to your notice that the British Government has been occupying itself with the question whether It might be useful to have a conference on the lines of the Berne Conference of last year to discuss the international situation regarding hours of work in industry.    I recently had an informal conversation on this matter with my German colleague, Dr. Brauns. and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour had a similar conversation with M- Durafour, the French Minister of Labour, on his way through Paris to Geneva in May.At the meeting with Dr. Brauns a certain number of points arising on the Washington Hours Convention were discussed, and it was agreed that I should summarise these and forward them not only to him but also to M. Durafour, to the Italian Minister of Labour, and to yourself.      The summary in question is enclosed with this letter.It is unnecessary for me to recapitulate here the long aeries of negotiations that have taken place on this matter, with which you are as familiar as I am, but I would merely say that in initiating these Informal conversations the British Government has been actuated not only by genuine concern for the maintenance of the principles of Part XIII of the Peace Treaty, but also by the consideration that the principles of the Washington Convention can only be really carried out in practice if agreement can be reached as to what are the obligations imposed by the Convention and if there can be devised some method of carrying them out which would be capable of general,  simultaneous and effective operation.I hope, therefore, that it may be possible for your Government and the other Governments to whom I have sent copies of the enclosed memorandum to let me have their views on the points contained in it in as def3.nite a form as Is practicable. I should be glad to receive these views as early as possible, but I recognise that it will no doubt be necessary, and Indeed essential, first to ascertain the views of those who represent Industry in the various countries./&apos;-&apos;
1 regard&apos; it.&quot; as indispensable to, a real and: satisfactory solution of the problem before us that agreement&apos; should be reached on the points dealt with in the merorandurn, and I doubt whether It would be worth while to hold another con-ference on the Hours Question unless such agreement seems probable..   If, however, the replied of the various Governments indicate that there exists a substantial prospect of such agreement, I should, then be prepared,to issue formal.invita-tions to the Governments concerned, to a conference to be held In London.Believe me,Yours very truly,(Sgd) ARTHTg STEEL-MA.ITLAND.Monsieur Wauters,Ministre d.u Travail, hue de la Lois,.

WASHINGTON HOURS CONVENTION.M3JOKANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR FPU GREAT BRITAIN.1. There are a number of quest3.ons on which the Interpreta-tion of the Convention is doubtful; different   countries have different interpretat5.ons.    A further conference of the prinoipal countries concerned seems to be desirable, if these points are to be cleared up, with a view to arr5.ving at a protocol which all the countries would accept and enforce.2. It is, however, of little use t0 have a further conference,unless there is some prospect of arriving at agreement on questions of doubtful interpretation, and unless, as a necessary condition precedent to any general ratification, the countries concerned will adopt uniform interpretations, will embody them in their legislation, and will make provision for their effective enforcement.3.5,In&apos; the opinion of Great Britain, arrangements should be made by the Government of each country for obtaining definite statistical Information as to how far the legislation is being observed, and what is the precise effect of any exceptions granted.     Returns should be made, in a uniform, form to be agreed upon, to the International Labour Office, so that each country may be able to know.what is the position as.to enforcement in other countries.If agreement pretation, and thecan be reached on doubtful points of inter-Feiat-ioa, ana wie countries concerned can satisfy each other that they will enforce effectively both these particular pro-visions In the sense agreed upon   and the general provisions of the Convention,  then It -will further be necessary for arrangements to be made for the legislation to come into force simultaneously in the principle countries concerned.Among the doubtful points of interpretation, the following &apos; 3 some of the most important.-appear to be some of the moi (a) Definition of &apos;&apos;hours of work&quot;.Thethe hours employerhours to be recognised as durins which the worker is1 hours of work&apos;&apos; should be at tho disposal of the. and not hours of &quot;effective work&quot;.      If any exemption from this definition is to be allowed, on the ground of the special nature of the occupation.;  such cases should be agreed in advance and specified in the protocol..(b)Conditions for workingovertime.(i) In the opinion of Great Britain it Is essential that overtime should oe paid for at a higher rate, and that both this requirement and the rate at which over-time is to be paid should be included in the law and not left to adwiinistrative regulations..    In the opinion of Great Britain the rate for overtime should be that stated in the Convention, i.e. not less than 25% more than the regular rate.- o -j
(II) In order to avoid the difficultlea which may he created by different interpretations of the Convention, for example, as. regards_ex.oep-ivl.ons In cases of exceptional pressure of work ^Article 5(b)7&quot;, It appears to Great Britain to be necessary to agree^upon a reason, able maximum number of hours which may be worked as overtime in the course of the- year for all reasons, excluding possibly breakdown.&apos;^iBtributlpn^ of hours of work.(i) Article 2.a     It is assumed, that the week means the calendar we-elc7 i.e., includes Sunday.(11) Article 4.n   The continuous processes to, which this Article is to apply should bp agreed upon and scheduled . in advance.(ill)Article 5. Agreement should be reached With regardj to the interpretation of the Convention on such points as that raised by Dr. Brauns with regard to the building] trade. Germany wishes the . seasonal na ture of work in , the building trade to be recognised, ro oh at the average of 48 hours may be. substantially exceeded in the .suamar, In consideration of the inevitable reduction of hours in the Winter, &quot; ..(iv) la an exception to be made to permit of such arrangements as those described by Dr. Brauns in rolling mills in Germany, where men work, in 12-hour shifts, but have a pause of two hours in the middle, -during which they, are free to leave, the works?A further explanation on this point would in any., ca-e appear tobe necessary.(v) Agreement must be reached on the question whether time lost for such reasons as holidays and breakdowns can be made up at other times .without the extra hours so worked being regarded as overtime.     In the ylaw of Great Britain these extra hours should be regarded as overtime. -      - &apos;(d) Kail ways..It .would appear to be desirable to consider the position of railways in relation to the.Convention.    It is open to question whether, on a correct Interpretation of the Conventioi the existing systems of railway working can be brought within the Convention.(Q) Article 14-It is understood that the German Government are of opinion that this Article gives a Government power to suspend the Convention in respect of an Industry or industries menaced by serious internal difficulties.      In tho opinion of Great Britain the Convention would not bear this interpretation j which, if adopted, would &quot;appear seriously to Imperil its wholes structure.
1 0 yf.1     4APPENDIX    II.Replies received, from the Governments of Belgium, France, Germany and Italy to the letter and memorandum given in Appendix I.TJt A N S L AT 1.0 IT. (1. BELGIUM)Ministry of Industry,Labour and Social Welfare. BRUSSELS.51st July,1925.labour Office - 3rd Section No. R. T.3500 - 11/10.My dear Colleague,I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th June relating to the measures to be taken to hasten the putting into force of the provisions of the Washington Convention on working hours,    I have studied with the keenest Interest the memorandum which was enclosed therewith and I am forwarding to you, herewith, replies which give the point of view of the Belgian Government on the various questions raised by the English Government.     As these questions are chiefly concerned with problems of    interpretation of a legal nature , it did not seem to us necessary to submit them for examination to representatives of industry, as each Government is free to adopt in this respect the attitude which it considers to be expedient.     Further, you will note that the Belgian Government has adopted, In its replies, the same paragraph numbering as was used by the English Government in its Memorandum.Like you, I hops that the views thus obtained from various sources will prove how useful would be a Conference which would bring about the desired agreement on the appli-cation on similar lines of the Hours Convent5.on.I am, etc (Signed)    J.   &apos;,VAUTSRS.
IPSMEMORANDUM.1.      .Tho Belgian Government, like tho Government of Great Britain, considers that a Confer- .icc   of the principal countries interested would certainly help to explain those points, the interpretation of which may seem obscure.2.        The Belgian Government is also of opinion that an exchange of views would be in any event .very useful, as it would help to clear away misunderstandings and   differences of opinion which are more apparent than real.    It goes without saying that the countries concerned must undertake to adopt such uniform inter-interpretations as would be agreed on, and embody them in their legislation.      It -is perhaps not out of place in this connection to point out that the Belgian Act of 1921 is in conformity with the provisions of the. Washington Convention.3.       The Belgian Government is.quite prepared to furnish the International Labour Office with all statistical information to enable it to judge of the application of the Convention and of the ORtent of the deviations and exceptions allowed.      In any case, the annual reports of the Inspectors of Labour and the triennial report recently presented to the legislative assemblies on the application of the Act, already, In our opinion, contain the deslrod information.4.       It.is clear that, if agreement is reached on points of doubtful interpretation,the enforcement of these provisions, subject to the interpretations agreed on, must be made simultaneously in the different..countries.5(a).     Definition of the term &quot;hours of work&quot;.. The Belgian Government, agreos that the, expression &quot;hours of   -ork&quot; contained In the. Convention must be understood In the sense of the time during.which .the. workman is actually at the disposal of his employer, and exclud.es the time reserved for rest in the course of the day,  changing clothes, etc.(b)     Conditions on which oyertlme may be worked.-(1) The Belgian Government is. entirely in agreement with&apos; the view that; work prolonged .beyond the normal, duration should be paid at a higher rate,&apos; whichlike the conditions on which the overtime is authorised,  should be fixed by law and not by administrative regulations.It is clear that overtime pay should be time and a quarter as prescribed by the Convention, and also that overtime pay should be granted only in the cases implicitly or explicitly prescribed in the Convention (Seasonal Industries, industries in which working hours cannot be exactly fixed, preparatory or complementary work, intermittent work, abnormal influx of orders), excluding extensions of hours authorised for continuous processes or for the adoption of the &quot;English Week&quot;../(2j
(2) The Belgian Government Is all the more reagv to subscribe to the proposal for fixing a maximum number of hou of overtime per annum for cases of exceptional pressure of work; excluding unforeseen stoppages, since Article 7 of the Belgian law fixes at about&apos; 150 hours a year the maximum contemplated.(c) Distribution of Working Hours.. (2-) A l*jL* &quot;     It is self-evidont that the weekly raaxirau of 48 hours covers the seven days&apos; of the week and, therefor includes Sundays., (2) The Belgian Government sees no objection to fixing by common agreement the list of continuous Industries or processes entitled, to benefit by the special regulations provided for in Article 4 of the Convention.(3) A3^t&apos;,5 * &quot; So far as the building industry ia concern it is clear &quot;that this must be first on the list of industrio which are subject to seasonal influence, and may, as such, ad.opt a system of making up at certain periods&apos; for time lost at others.(4) The Belgian Government is prepared to adopt the system praotisod in rolling mills In-Germany on condition, however, that It is clearly understood that the average of 56 hours a week is not exceeded, as prescribed by Article 4 of the Convention.(5) The Belgian Government does not soe how the making up of time lost on account of holidays or voluntary Idleness can be justified by any of tho provisions of the Washington Convention.      If* however,  the heads of undertakings are to be empowered to do this by the proposed international agreement, it is clear that those hours must be regarded as overtime for which extra wages at time and a quarter must be paid.(d) Railways.The Belgian Government is of opinion that Art.1(d) of tho Convention settles any doubts on the subject of the application of the ConventIon to railway undertakings, railway undertakings are subject to this Article as are all other forms of. transportation of persons or goods, pending as eventual agreement on the subject of the oxomptions which may be permitted within the limits of the Convention.5(e). It is. not admissible, as&apos; the German Government., desires, for the Convention to be suspended at the will of the Gfcf/ornment in favour of one or more industries because they are threatened by serious internal difficulties. Article 14 of the Convention admits of only two cases of general suspension of these provis ionswar or an occurrence which threatens national security.      No other hypothesis can therefore, bo entertained.
S. FRANCETRANSLATION.French Ropubli c, Ministry of Labour, Cabinet of the Minister, Pari s.15th J anua ry,  19 26.Dear Minister,.With a view to the proposed Conference to hasten and facilitate tho ratification of the Washington 8 Hour Day Convention you were so kind as to sond me a memorandum which, you also addressod to the Gorman, Belgian and Italian Governments, as well as to the Director of the International Labour Office.I have tho honour to transmit to you here-with tho observations suggested to me by tho memorandum.1.     A conference between tho principal industrial countries interested in the ratification of the Convention appears to me desirable.      The fact that several countries and notably Franco have subordinated or have the intontion of subordinating thoir own ratification to that of. other countries underlines tho need for an agreement between these countries with a view to simultaneous ratification.It goe3 without saying that this Conforonoe could not have as a consequence, tho modification in any way of the Convention ovon if this modification had for its object that of facilitating ratification for cortain countries.Tho Convention should be ratified as it stands in its text and its spirit.   - Only a new International Conference convened under the conditions provided for. by Part XIII of tho Treaty of Peace would.have the powor to modify it.     Moreover, there is a. certain number of countries which havo already ratified&apos;it as -it - stands, and others whioh have proposed its ratification to their Parliaments in the same conditions.Far from facilitating ratification, such a procedure would complicate,the question and dolay its solution.  -   It would- seem that- there is no difforenoo of opinion on this point-It might be asked howovor, whether the protocol proposed by tho memorandum which would terminate the pro-posed Conference would not have the sarao result.Doubtless the protocol would interpret the text of the Convention and would not modify it.     But it is difficult to draw a line of demarcation between modifi-cations properly so called, and interpretations.      If a
Government has admitted a certain interpretation of tho Convention and has givon public voice, for example, to such interpretation before its Parliament in order to obtain ratification, the faot that it adopts later on by virtue of tho protocol another interpretation, would not that be equivalent to a modification of the Con-vention itself and would this not oblige the said Government to submit tho question once again to its Parliament?It is not my intention to say that each Government is free to interpret tho Convention in its own and that it has the right to admit interpretations which are in conflict with its text and spirit.     If this were the case it would moan the negation of all Conventions.If the interpretation given by a Government to a Convention which it has ratified soems open to objection, each of the other Governments which have also ratified it, oan by virtue of Article 411 of the Treaty of Peace deposit a complaint with tho International Labour Office which then follows tho procedure provided for by Articles 411 ot soq.     In the last analysis it is tho International.Court of Justice which will givo a final decision on tho definitive Interpretation of tho Convention.Only the&apos; International court of Justico has competence and powers in this matter.     A protocol on which the principal industrial countries interested have oomo to an agreoment could not have the same value.Moreover, it would be more difficult to achieve unanimity among tho interested countries, for euch a protoool than to obtain a 3/3rd majority of the International Conference for a new text.In our opinion the Conference proposed between the principal interested countries should.havo for its object, before all,-- that of enabling each of theso countries to inform itself of the interpretation given by each of the. others to the Convention in order to obtain a clear knowledge of the meaning and consequences which ratification of the Convention ?/ould have for each of these countries.Further,  the Conference might on points on which there are cloarly dlvorgont interpretations endeavour to unify and harmonise points of view.It would then be the task of oach country to go into the question whether it is possible for it to ratify the Convention.It goes without saying that oach country should eventually amend its legislation to bring it into harmony with the agroomonts come to.
2.    Replies to the questions put unclor No.2. have1 - t been given       above *3.    Tho question put under No.5. has evidontly for its object the statistical data to be furnished by coun-tries having ratifiod the Convention.     Such information could not be demanded of those who have not ratified it; a fortiori - from countries which have no legislation even on&apos; the subject.It seems that tho question is already settled by. the Convention itself.Article 7 obliges Governments that have ratified to communioate to the International Labour Office;(a) a list of processes classified as continuous;(b) complete information on the extent ofsuch agreements as are provided for under Article 5 (tho establishment of .tiine-tables for a period longer than the week)j(c) complete information on tho regulationsissued by virtue of Article 6  (permanent and temporary - exceptions) and their application.It may be useful if the different countries come to agreement on the form in which this information and all other data concerning the -application of the Convention shall be furnished to&apos; the International Labour Office.      The French Government is quite ready to enter into negotiations for this purpose.     But oxperience shows that tho intornational unification of statistics is a long and delicate task.     The French Governmont fears that ratification may be delayed if it is sub-ordinated to this unification...4.    If an agreement can bo arrived at on points of doubtful interpretation., it is evidently desirable that the agreement come to should stipulate that national legislations shall be modified in consequence, and that these anondmerits shall come into force simultaneously. But it seoms inexpedient that the question should bo settled in advance on all points whatever their importance and the difficulties that might be met with in any particular country in putting into force the amendments agreed upon.      It may so happen that in consideration of theso difficulties or of the small Importance of the points in dispute, different periods of time may be provided for by common- agreement.5.   (&apos;0 Definition of hours of work.     The expression &quot;effective work&quot; 1 s not&quot; found in the Convention, but it follows from the- different Articles of the Convention, especially Article 8,  that the hours of work to which it fixes a limit are the hours during which the worker is at the disposal of the employer, after deducting rosts granted during the duration of work and not considered
as part of tho hours of work.Tho French law employs the expression &quot;duration of effective work&quot;, but this expression has exactly &quot;the .same sense.     It is the time on call  (duroe de presence) of the worker in a factory after deducting rests, i.e., the time during which the worker is effectively at the disposal of his employer.     The terF ffeffective work? is not -synonymous with productive work.French legislation admits no excoption to this regulation.     The. duration of effoctive work thus defined may not exceed the limit fixed by legislation except in the case of permanent and temporary exceptions expressly provided for.     For - example, it is provided that the duration of effective work may in certain in-duatries be prolonged to 9 hours for timekeepers (?) and Office-keepers.     There is no question here of an elastic interpretation of tho oxpression &quot;duration of effective work&quot; but of the application of an exception provided, for by the French law as well as by the Washington Convention, in.accordance with the terns of whioh the limit on tho duration of work may bo -exceeded &quot;for certain classes of persons whoso work is specially intermittent&quot; .:(b) Over tim or Condi tl on a..     Article 8 of tho Convention reads that the rate of pay for overtime, Lev:, temporary exceptions which it is necessary to authorise in order to enable enterprises to deal with exceptional pressure of work,  shall not be less than one and one quarter times the regular rate.Tho French Government doos not deny the com-pulsory character of this clause.     Whether it be in-&apos;eluded in the law or in tho Public Administrative Regulations issued by virtue of the law, it has in French law the same compulsory value.; &apos;    Is it necessary to come to an agreement on a reasonable maximum number of hours&apos; overtime authorised in a year for any particular reason except perhaps breakdown of machinery?The French regulations are conceived in this sense, since differing in this from other legislations, thoy limit for each industry the number of hours of overtime which may be worked annually.      This number is very variable, as too arc the needs of the different industries.     If prily one maximum is fixed for all industrios, it will have to be fixed with regard to industries whiohhavo the greatest need and it risks being excessive for the generality of industries.     At the Washington Conference of 1919 two maxima were con-templated; one applying to&apos; tho generality of industries, tho other,  considerably higher, applying only to.&quot; certain industries designated by name.
It. must not be forgotten that if there were an agreement on this point, infringements of this agreomont would not be penalised in the same way as infringements of the Convention itself would be.(c) M.gAri.butiop, of the hours of labour.   :1 - Article 2.      The bearing of the remarks regarding the definition of tho xvoel: in Article 2 are not understood.The week is a period of seven consecutive days comprising necessarily one Sunday.Is it to be understood by the so romarks that the 48 hours a we ok referred to in Article 2 may be. distri-buted over 7 days at the rato, for example, of 6 days&apos; of 7 hours and one day of 8?It is not thought that this is the sense of Article 3.      Sunday or woekly rost Is the rule in all in-dustrial States.      The Convention supposes the application of this rule, and this is why the normal system it seeks to set up by the first paragraph of Article 2 is a week com-p rising 5. days of work of 8 hours., i.o., 48 hours..The possibility of distributing tho working hours over 7 days and of exceeding the weekly limit of 48 hours is provided for by the Convention only by way of exception, in Article 3  (c), in Article 4 and in Article 5.It is, of course, understood that the above considerations apply to the normal woek, regard being had to the regulation of weekly rest.Article 4.     Article 7 of the Convention stipulates that each government shall communicate to the International Labour Office the list of processes considered by it as coming under the above Article.An agreement may be arrived at for limiting these processes but it would add,, to the Convention.3 - Article 5.      Tho same remark.     An agreement on this point would add to the obligations arising from Article 7 in the application of this article.    Further explanations.seem in fact to be necessary on tho subject of the cases referred to by Dr. Braun-concerning rolling mills.     According to the letter of Article 4, it would authorise any organisation of work not exceeding 58 hours, on average a week..    Having regard to preparatory work, it would seom that tho object of this regulation was, not to authorise more than 8 hours per shift, but to mako the numbor of shifts of 8 hours 7 a woek.
It. must not be forgotten that if there were an agreement on this point, infringements of this agreement would not be penalised in the same way as infringements of the Convention itsolf would be.(c) Distribution of the hours of labour^ .:1 - Article 2.      Tho bearing of the remarks regarding the definition of tho week in Article 2 are not understood.The week is a period of sovon consecutive days comprising necessarily one Sunday.Is it to be understood by theso romarks that the 48 hours a weok referred to in Article 3 may be. distri-buted over 7 days at the rato, for example, of 3 days of 7 hours and one day of 8 7It is not thought that this is the sense of Article 2.      Sunday or wookly rost is the rule in all ln-dustrial States.      The Convention supposes the application of this rule, and this is why the normal system it seeks to set up by the first paragraph of Article 2 is a week com-prising 6.days of work of 8 hours, i.o., 48 hours.The possibility of distributing tho working hours over 7 days and of exceeding the weekly limit of 48 hours is provided for by the Convention only by way of exception, in Article 3 (c), in Article 4 and in Article 5.It is, of course, understood that the above considerations apply to the normal woek.  regard being had to the regulation of weekly rest.Article 4.     Article 7 of the Convention stipulates that each Government shall communicate to the International Labour Office the list of processes considered by it as coming under the above Article.An agreement may be arrived at for limitingthese processes but it would add.to the Convention.3 - Articlo. 5...     The same remark.     An agreement on this point would add to the obligations arising from Articlo 7 in the application of this Article.4.    Further explanations seem in fact to be necessary on ,tho subjectof the.cases referred to by Dr. Braun-concerning rolling mills.     According to the letter of Article 4, it would authorise any organisation of work not exceeding 56 hours, on average a week.     Having regard to preparatory work, it would seom that tho object of this regulation was, not to authorise more than 8 hours per shift, but to mako the number of shifts of 8 hours 7 a woek.
5.   Article 5 which provides that tho limit may be exceeded in case of accident or of force majouro and Article 0 which provides for overtime in order to   &apos; deal with exceptional increase of work, are two dietinot provisions to meet to different noeds, and in the opinion of the.French Government thoy should be applied independ-ently one of the other. . .&quot;(d) Hallways.   .&quot; &apos;.It seems difficult to maintain that the Convention   does not apply to railways.     Article 1 in fact states expressly &quot;transport of passengors or goods by rail&quot;.The French Government is of opinion that a correct interpretation of tho Convention permits of its application to railways.     It is also of opinion that tho regulations which it has issued for the application of the 8 hour day to the railways appear to it to be in con-formity with the Convention.In any case, tho proposed conference could neither declare the Convention inapplicable to railways nor admit for railways exceptions other than those pro-vided for in the Convention.(e ) Article. 14;. -In the opinion of the French Government Article 14 does not permit a&apos;Government to suspend the Convention where it is a quostion of ono or more industries threatened with serious internal difficulties.Article 14 can apply only &quot;in the event of war or other emergency endangering the national safety.&quot;Tho Reporter of the Commission at tho Inter-national Conference at Washington of 1919, in reply to a proposal which was made to dele to from this Article the words &quot;in tho event of war&quot; doclared -&quot;I foar that the doletion of the words &quot;in tho event of war&quot; might lead to an improper oxtension being given to tho words &quot;in the event of emergencies endangering the national safoty&quot;.     When those words follow tho words &quot;in the event of war&quot; the meaning of the whole phrase is clear, and when they are isolated there might bo a temptation to give them ah.improper extension. &apos;: I beliovo that thorc will bo more temptation to take advantage of tho words &quot;in the ovoht of emergencies endangering tho national security&quot; if the words &quot;in the ovent of war&quot; do not precede.     We have explained why what follows was added;- it is because of the law of certain countries which provides for the case of danger of war.     1 think that it is necessary to loavc the toxt as it stands, and I renow the hopo that use will never be made of it&quot;. e
Following these remarks the amendment for the delotion was rejected by 40 votes to 4, after the author of the amendment had himself acknowledged that the Reporter was right.In these conditions it does not seem that the sense of Article 14 can be doubtful.Believe me,Yours etc,(Signed) DURAFOUR.
TRANSLATION(5.  GERMANY)Federal Minister of Labour,/Tri replying,&quot; please&apos;   &quot; quote III.B.45417BERLIN,    N.W.40. Scharnhorsirasse, 35,22nd August,1925.To:      &apos; -&apos;      &apos; &apos; H ,&apos;-- &apos;     .;.;&apos;:: ; &apos; Jt Sir Arthur - Stee 1 -Mai11and,&apos;&apos; Ministry of. Labour,; -  London,Dear Sir Arthur Steel-Ma it land,1 am much obliged to you for your letter of 17th June, 1925.    I regret that I ani only now able to answer it; it was necessary to&apos;wait until the preliminary work in my Ministry in connection-with a new Hours of,Work &quot;Act had reached a oertain definite stage, in order fully to appreciate the bearing on German conditions of the questions contained! in your letter.As you know.. German legislation, on working hours already recognises the principle of the eight hour day. Moreover, as I have already publicly announced on several occasions, the attitude of. the German Government towards the question of an international agreement concerning working hours is of an entirely friendly nature.    I;am, therefore, glad to hear that you propose to invite the Ministers of Labour who took part in the Berne meeting last year, with the addition of the Italian Minister of Labour, to participate in a further discussion in London.      I am of opinion that further discussion cannot but be of assistance in arriving at an international understanding on the Washington Convention, and do not consider the differences of opinion regarding the Interpretation -of the Convention to be of so insuperable:a nature that a further effort should not be made&apos; to arrive at a oomplete agreement. ,  . . ;  ,..&apos;..-,..,,.....,,;-/ .....Nevertheless, I must take this opportunity to refer tothe special position, of Germany in regard to this question. The German Government; did hot take part in. the   proceedings at Washington, and was, therefore , unlike other Governments, , unable, before the adoption of the Convention, to make any observations on its compatibility with.the development of, and special circumstances affecting. German industrial life. Moreover, as is well known, international agreements have laid German Industry for the coming decades under enormous contribu-tions,. which call for special caution before further international obligations are undertaken.    I&apos; should regard it as serious, if the proposed negotiations should result in Imposing further considerable Obligations beyond those covered by the Convention, the possibility of which, from certain of the questions touched upon by you, does not appear to be excluded.      It seems to me necessary, while adhering to. the principle of a uniform inter-pretation to take into consideration the differing circumstances of the various countries.    I regard your proposal to Include Italy in the negotiations as valuable.    I -would, however,
venture to submit that It might be well, having regard to the close commercial relations between Germany, Prance, Italy and Switzerland, and&apos; their common boundaries, to include Switzerland also in the further negotiations.. You .wish to know my views on certain points, in order that you may be able to judge ,. from the opinion of the various countries, the probable success of a fresh discussion. I consider that a definite understanding on some of your questions can be arrived at only as the resui of a joint verbal discussion. By a discussion of this kl will the way be more easily found to overcome the existing difficulties. I beg, therefore ,, that, the following remark may be understood subject to this premise.I am quite in agreement with you that a uniform application of the Convention In,the various, countries is the most important preliminary Condition of joint ratifies tlon.      I pointed out in Frankfort, however   how difficult it is to exercise any control In this respect, especially in countries which, unlike England and Germany, do not possess a well-organised system of factory inspection and a strong Trade&quot;Union movement.    In Germany, the annual reports of the factory inspection officials even now conta valuable information regarding the application of the legislation on working hours, especially data concerning the inspections made.; overtime sanctioned,.. and other exceptions.-&apos;   These statistics might,, after the ratificati of tho Washington Convention, be amplified in,..such .a manna &apos;as to offer a reliable, survey of all the deviations -f ro$ the normal working hours sanctioned by-the inspection authorities.-. Oh the &quot;other /hand^ it,would, hardly be possible in my bplnlon, to include, in statistical -form, extensions of working hours which are permissible&apos;without official sanction.      Such comprehensive statistics would place an unduly heavy burden on employers&quot;., &quot;officials and State find It should, however,&apos; be possible to&quot;.dispense with these dat as the Convention leaves to the parties only a comparative small - number o.f exceptions for Independent decision; and a &apos; the ratifying ^States&quot;&apos; are on a like . footing in this ; respect,I havo already stated in Frankfort that I am in agree ment with your .interpretation of working hours The necess exceptions will &quot;chiefly relate . to branches of industry and occupations in which time on call (Arbgitsbere i t s cha-f t) is an&apos;important factor;/    ,;.&apos;..: ...: .        &apos;    &quot;&quot;&quot;*tiThe prbv is ion; regarding,the extra, allowance for overt (which was &quot;also&apos; -discussed. ,.a&apos;t Frankfort) is -particularly difficult to re cone lie.&apos; With German industrial practice.   In this country, overtime is paid, according to its nature, sometimes with&apos;a lower and some times, with: a higher -extra allowance.&apos; &apos;. The proscription ,of. a definite minimum extra allowance to be applicable in all .cases would entail considerable practical difficulties    It would certainly be be opposed to some extent even by the Trade -Unions ,&apos;- by reason&apos;of the inducement&quot;it would offer to work   overtime. , Possibly, it&apos;might be compatible.&apos; with, the&apos; Convention to reg this&apos; clause, not as a standard applicable to every Individ&quot; -case/ but&apos;, only as a. guiding rule&apos;, regarding the amount of t extra allowance&apos;generally.    &apos; It should, also be made clear, in my opinion, that the extra overtime &quot;allowance is applicable only to overtime in the sense of article 6(b) o the Convention.
The Convention does not provide for a maximum number Of permissible hours of overtime, especially in cases of extraordinary pressure of work.    Any restriction in this direction would go beyond the terras of the Convention. Perhaps it might be possible to limit the number of hours overtime for the different types of exception.    On the other hand, I hardly consider it possible to fix an over-riding maximum for all permissible exceptions, as the circumstances necessitating overtime ma:/ for different reasons be of an entirely different nature.    Owing to the absence from the Convention of limitations of this kind, those countries which have already ratified the Convention may also find themselves in difficulties.The expression. &apos;&apos;week&quot; must, as I held at Berne, be interpreted as implying the calendar week Inclusive of Sunday. It is a question, howtever, for consideration whether, in certain public supply Industries, e.g., dairies, a definite amount of necessary Sunday work, in certain circumstances, over and above the 48 weekly hours, should not be permitted.The question of the continuous undertakings was also discussed at Frankfort.      The Convention does not provide for the compilation of a list of such undertakings before ratification.      The compilation of such a list would certainly offer d.difficulties, owing to the widely different nature of the circumstances in the various countries (i,e. , technical development, economic conditions)..      I explained at Frankfort that a distinction is made in Germany between continuous under-takings and specific classes of work which, by their nature, must be carried on without interruption, although the whole of the undertaking need not be carried on continuously.The description I gave at Frankfort of the solution frequently adopted in German rolling mills, i.e., by means of substitutes, does not imply an adherence to the two-shift system, but was intend.ed only as an illustration of actual conditions.    It therefore appears to me hardly necessary to discuss this point further.The question of the making up of working time lost by reason of public holidays or accidents must, especially in &apos; view of French legislation, be cleared up by further discussion.:The treatment of railways, especially the question whether they are to be regarded as continuous undertakings, alscg needs further discussion.    It is of particular importance to Germany, in view of the German State Railways Act. The same applies to the application of Article 14 of the Convention. As regards the latter point, I would in this connection refer to the detailed statement I made at Frankfort,and would wish only particularly to emphasise the fact that Germany does not ask for any form of special treatment in this respect, but that It concedes to all ratifying countries the powers which, according to its interpretation, are conferred by Article 14.I should be gratified if my explanations were of any assistance in your valuable effort to bring about an inter-national understanding on the hours of work question.    In this hope, I remain, with cordial greetings.Yours etc.(Signed) DR.  JBRAUNS.
If?ITALY.(TRANSLATION)5462.A. 18.       . : ITALIAN   EMBASSY,7th December, 1925,Sir,In ft. letter I.L.166-1925 of the 17th June last Sir A. Steel-maitland&quot;, the British Minister of Labour, transmitted to the Italian Minister of National Economy a memorandum referring to the possibility of a meeting in London between the representatives of the governments interested in the ratification of the International Labour Convention relative to Hours of Labour drawn up at Washington in 1919.In Sir A, Steel-Maitland&apos;s letter it was added that before formally announcing the said conference, the British Minister of -Labour thought It desirable to learn the opinions of the different governments on the specific questions which were to form the subject of the deliberations which he set forth in a memorandum enclosed in his letter*-With reference to this request, I.have the honour to transmit to Your Excellency a memorandum stating the views of the Italian government oh the questions enunciated by Sir A, Steel-Maitland, and I venture to request you to be good enough, in comrnunieating it to the Minister of Labour, to add that the Italian Government would be glad to take part, through their representatives, in a conference to be held in London to discuss the desirability of simultaneously ratifying the, Washington Eight-Hour Day Convention which Italy has already herself ratified subject to the condition that it be ratified by the other great industrial Powers,In thanking Your Excellency for your courteous attention to this matter. .I have, etc.,,   (Signed)    TORRETTA,The Right Honourable,Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G,, M.P., etc., etc,, etc.,
(TRANSLATION) ,Attitude of the Italian Government on the various points of the Memorandum of the British Minister of Labour relative to the ratification of the Washington Convention on Hours of Labour.1,     In view of the fact that the Italian government have already deposited the ratification of the Convention under discussion, although making It conditional upon ratification by certain Powers, the Italian government cannot do otherwise&apos; than regard with sympathy the convening of a conference, between the more important States, charged with the task of arriving at an agreement on the disputed points of the Convention, and they sincerely hope that it 1 may be possible to achieve the aim of rendering possible the ratification and general application thereof on the basis of an interpretation which will take into account both the requirements of-production and the interests&apos; of the working classes, -On this subject the Italian&apos;government must first of al state as a matter of principle that the form of the Convention, which is generally held to be too rigid, does not seem to be such as to exclude absolutely an interpreta-tion which permits,   without invalidating its fundamental principles, the technical and economic requirements of the various industries to be taken into account, and which at the same time allows, in order&apos; to make compensation for the increase occurring in the costs of production in consequence of the restrictions of the hours of labour, of securing th9 intensification of the productive activity of the workman and the stimulation of appreciable and continuous progress in the technique of the plants and in the economic organisation of the administration,Y/ithout this adaptability it is evident that the Convention would have no foundation or ra is oh d&apos;etre, since it cannot in any way be assumed; that its promoters and signatories desired to produce a work at variance with the eoonomic possibilities of the various countries.    In fact, if due regard is paid to the letter and the spirit of the Convention, its olauses either appear to admit of an inter-pretation which does not lend them the appearance of being absolutely inapplicable, or they provide for submission where desirable to the varioxxs national legislations and to the agreements of the organisations of the individual countries and of the particular regimes for special countries since it is&apos; a principle whioh has always been admitted at the various international labour conferences that the conventions should leave a certain freedom of adaptation to the conditions of each country,
2,      In common.with the British Government, the Italian Government nevertheless concur in the view that the convening of the conference in question may be of value Inasmuch as there is a prospect that it may not be impossible to arrive at an understanding as regards the interpretation to be given to-the Convention, and inasmuch as the various States which will participate in the Conference may be prepared to adopt and carry Into effect the resolutions thereof,3,.     While supporting in principle the proposal of the British Government to Impose upon each State the obligation to make provision for the collection of statistics regarding the application of the Convention, the Italian Government would observe.that the statements and information to be communicated to the International Labour Office \uider article 7- of the Convention might suffice for the purposes indicated by the British Government, and that If It were desired for other reasons to make provision for the obligation to compile statistical data,, the difficulties to be surmounted in collecting and arranging such data, which will be by no means small in the great industrial countries, must be taken into account. , . -4, &apos;   In the event of agreement being reached on the points at issue of the Convention and the manner of its application, the Italian Government can only associate them-selves with the view of, the British Government that the States participating in the agreement shall simultaneously arrange to introduce into their legislation the modifications rendered necessary, in order to bring the same into line with the Convention, in accordance with the interpretation to be accorded thereto by the Conference,5,     Subject, to the. foregoing, the views; of the Italian Government regarding the various points of doubtful interpre-tation of the Convention specified by the British Government are as follows        -(a)    The hours to be recognised as &quot;hours of labour&quot; for the piirposes of the restrictions prescribed in article 2 of the-Convention cannot be held to be those during which the workman is at the disposal of the employer but those of effective work, both because there is nothing to warrant a different.interpretation and this is the one hitherto accepted by the States which have already ratified the Convention, arid because otherwise the Convention would be totally inapplicable .to many occupations of an essentially intermittent nature or involving mere attendance or care-taking.     With-regard to this.interpretative standard the Conference should consider whether it is not desirable to leave forthwith to the Individual.legislatures the duty of defining what is meant by effective work or of specifying in a suitable protocol what occupations cannot by reason of their special character fall within the limits prescribed by the Convention, and what pauses situated between the beginning and end of every period representing a working day must be deducted from the total, of effective work.      In this connec-. tion it appears to the Italian Government that the principle
i must be accepted that the restrictions as to hours of labour cannot be applied to occupations requiring intermittent work or mere attendance or care taking end that, moreover, there must be deducted from the total of effective labour any pauses of a certain duration, not exceeding definite limits, during which no services are required of the. workman,     In fine it appears, to the Italian Government, to be necessary to lay down that, save for suitable exceptions-in the case of miners, for the purposes of computing effective labour the time spent by the workman in proceeding to his place of work must not be taken into consideration,(b) As regards the conditions: for extraordinary work:(i) If on the one hand there is.no doubt that the percentage increase of 25% laid down by the Convention for the payment of extra work in relation to that of effective work represents a minimum and not a maximum rate of Increase to be fixed in the various legislations&apos;, on the other hand it appears that this increase of pay must be applied exclusively to extraordinary work properly so called and not to other services which may be allowed beyond the normal duration of the work, as it would be necessary to maintain if it were admitted that the last paragraph of article 6 of the Convention refers to (a)as well as to (b) of that article,(ii) Moreover, it does not appear necessary to restrict in the agreement at which it is desired to arrive the scope of the Convention by laying down limitations respecting the annual maximum of hovers admitted for extraordinary work, seeing that the Convent! explicitly yields as regards this maximum though under certain conditions, to the national legislation, in consideration of the fact that by its very nature extraordinary work is always confined within the limits of the exceptional and temporary exigencies of the enterprise,(c) For the purposes of the distribution of the hours of labour       ..(i)    By week must be understood the calendar week including Sunday,(li) It may be possible to arrive at an agreement to draw up in advance &amp; list of the occupations to which article 4 of the Convention is applicable,(Hi) An understanding should be arrived at to interpret article 5 of the Convention as meaning that the option provided therein of being able to regulate in ultra-weekly periods the daily duration of work shall be admitted in all cases In which it may be neoessary by reason of technical or seasonal exigencies, which shall, however, be specified and tabulated beforehand,
(Iv)    It may be desirable to go further into the question raised by Germany regarding the special regula-tion of the hours of labour in rolling-mills .(v)    The recovery of lost hours by means of extra hours not to be regarded as extraordinary work should be admitted,(d) The question whether the Convention is applicable to the present systems of railway work should be examined by the Conference in order to arrive at an interpretation which admits that modifications at variance with the technical and economic requirements of the railway servites shall not extend to them..(e) With regard to artiole 14 of the Convention an interpretation should be arrived at which given to the governments the power to suspend for definite industries the application of the provisions which limit the period of work when the eventual derogations to be accorded in altogether exceptional circumstances for this purpose are justified on the ground of general interest.5.
