!ggg DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S gOYJSKffMPKT.) SECRET.. ^- Copy No. SO[fl.P.4S(g6). CABINET.SAFEGUARDING OP INDUSTRIES APPLICATION (IROH A!:g) STEEL). Memorandum by tbe Minister of Agricull.ure and Fisherifc^.With reference to conclusion 8 of Cabinet 2 (26) 1 circulate the annexed memorandum on the use of wire in agriculture.     The beat estimate that I can obtain puts the value of wire, products of wire, and ateel joists used in agriculture at some  2,000.000 per annum.This is a considerable sum but the political objections to the safeguarding proposal are even greater than the economic objections.   Agriculturists are constantly complaining that articles of food are excluded from the Safegu&amp;rCLng of Industries scheme.   TJp to tho present they have not been able to say that any article used in their Industry is safeguarded.   But if a duty is placed on imported wire their complaints will be loud and bitter.   For some time they have kept up a running fire of criticism against the Government In connection with the legislation passed last session - The Rating and Valuation Act, the Widows1 Pensions Act and the Tithe Act. Many of thoir grievances in this connection are imaginery, but I think it would be very unfortunate if we gave them a real grievance by taxing an article which every farmer, small holder and backyard poultry keeper uses, while denying them protection for their produce.I suggest therefore that the President of the Board of Trade should refuse to set up a Safeguarding Committee on the ground that to protect the materials in question would have wide repercussion on a basic Industry.W.

SAFStHJAftulMG OP IMUUfrTRIES APPLICATION (IRON AtU) STEAL)&apos;&apos; memorandum on the use of wire, wire rods and steel . 1   joists in agriculture 71.   It is understood this application relates to Iron and steel wire, wire netting, woven wire, possibly to wire rods, and also to steel joists and girders.2.    itfire rods are mainly the raw material from which wire is drawn; but it is probable that some of this material may be used in its original form in the manufacture of iron hurdles, continuous iron fencing, standards for wire netting, supports, etc.3.   Agriculture is interested in the effect of any duty on these materials so far as they are used in the production of the following goods:-(a) Ordinary fencing wire - e.g., annealed wire, strand&quot;&quot;wire, barbed wire.(b) Interlocked square mesh wire, which is now Eeing extensively ucea for fencing purposes,(c) Wire notting, used chiefly as a protection agains &quot;&quot;&quot;ground game, for poultry runs, sheep penning, etc.(d) Manufaptured^goo ds such as staples for fixing wire, wire nails used extensively in ordinary timber fencing, wire used in the making of spile, or split chestnut fencing, cables for steam ploughing tackle, iron hurdles, iron gates and continuous iron.fencing.(e) Tools and Implements in the construction of which only a small proportion of wire is used, e.g. . Rakes, Forks , Chain-harrows , ;yine -harrows, Iron spoked wheels for drills, ploughs, etc.(f) Iron used by Blacksmiths for general repairs, Shoeing nails.(g) Steel Joist3/and girders, in the construction of DuSoh Earr.e*J&quot; Covered Yards, Cart sheds; etc. Possibly also the smaller joists may include the material used in the framing of Wind pov-er pumps.4.    It is difficult to estimate the total amount of these materials actually used in agriculture, or for ordinary Estate purposes. as regards fencing and wire netting large quantities are also
used in connection with plantations, and woodlands^ %  There are no guiding figures in either the Census ofProduction made for the year 1907, or in the recentBoard of Trade Returns,    Such figures as areavailable have been carefully examined, and the Boardof Trade have roughly estimated the annual home production atFencing wire    -    60,000 tons Wire netting   -   30,000 tons.After making allowance for Imports and Exports, theamount of these materials used for Home Consumptionannually might be roughly estimated at:-Fencing wire    -   51,500 tons Wire netting   -   16,000 tons.5.    In the case of both of these classes of material a certainproportion is used for fencing, etc. not connected withagriculture or ordinary Estate work, and allowing forthis, the following estimates have been arrived at:-fencing wire    -   45,000 tons Wire netting   -   15,000 tons.6.   The annual value of these based on the average figuresof Imports    and Exports would be approximately:-Fencing wire - 45,000 tons at  18 - 810,000 Wire netting - 15,000 tons at  30   a   450,000fcl,26Q,000To the above figure of  1,260 ,.000, must be added the value of the materials used in connection with the goods referred to in 3 (d) (e) and (f), which would probably raise the total to  1,500,000 prime cost per annum. For the Dutch Barns, Sheds, etc., mentioned in 3 (g) the sum of  160,000 per annum for constructional steel joists and girders might be allowed, or with a margin for iron and steel rods used in connection with the construction of these buildings say  200,000.
7.   The total figure thus arrived at,  1,700,000, represents prime cost.   The cost of these same goods to the agriculturist, or landowner will he increased by the ,profits and expenses earned by the middleman, and salesman.    Allowing 25% to cover this the ultimate selling price would amount to  .2,125,,000 per annum.8.    The use of wire, for. fencing purposes is rapidly increasing.The breaking up of the large estates during the past twenty years has entailed the construction of a great deal of new boundary fencing, and the change of ownership has been an occasion for extensive alterations on the farms affected.   Another factor is the recent laying down of lands to pasture.    It is a rare thing today to find quick-set hedges being planted.    Wire fences are the cheapest form of fencing and quickest to erect, and save a great ceal of subsequent expenditure in maintenance.   The lack of skilled labour, and the cost of such labour if available has caused a serious decline in the proper preservation of live fences and many of these are in such a bad state, that they have had to be strengthened, and gapped with wire to render them stock-proof.   The extension of poultry keeping and the modern method of keeping poultry in confined enclosures entail the use of an enormous amount of wire netting.    The use of hurdles, and string netting for penning or folding -   sheep is giving way to various forms of wire netting. Again wire is more extensively used in Hop Gardens, Pig-keeping in the open has Involved an extensive use of wire fencing.   The break up of Estates has frequently led to the ownership of farms being divorced from the ownership of woodlands, with the result that timber for fencing is not so easily or cheaply obtainable.Ministry of agriculture and Fisheries. 8th February, 1926.
