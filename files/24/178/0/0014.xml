(Memorandum prepared in the Colonial Office).In deciding on the 16th of December last that the present provisional boundary should be adopted as the frontier between Iraq and Turkey, the Council of the League of Nations attached tho following condition to their award&quot;The British Government is invited to submit to the Council a new Treaty with Iraq,  ensuring the contlnuanoe for twenty-five years of the mandatory regime defined by the Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Iraq and by the British Government;1 s &quot;undertaking approved by the council on the 27th September,, 1924,. unless Iraq is,  in conformity with Article 1 of the Covenant, admitted as a Member of tho League before the expiration of this period.As soon as, within a period of six months from the present date, the execution of this stipula-tion has been brought to the knowledge of the Council, the Oounoll shall declare that the present decision has become definitive and shall indicate the measures required  to insure the delimitation on the ground of the frontier line&quot;*The Secretary of State for the Colonies accepted the Council&apos;s decision on behalf of His Majesty1s Government and of the Ghverrment of Iraq, and stated that he hoped to submit at a very early date,   the new Treaty, whose execution would give final effect to the decision announced by the Council,    when referring . to the matter in the House of Commons on the 21st
December, the Prime Minister gave the following undertaking:&apos; -     &quot;I decided  ,  .  .  .  , at the beginning of next Session to have the proposed Treaty laid before the House for tho judgment of the House to be taken      on it.      On that occasion it will be open to the House to have the fullest and freest discussion and como to a definite.declsion as to whether or not they will adopt it&quot;c- It was thus essential, in order fa) that the Councils award might be made definitive; fb) that tho present uncertainty with regard, to the northern frontier of Iraq might be removed at the earliest- possible date^ and  f o) that the text of tho new Treaty might bo laid before Parliament on the 2nd of February,  in accordance with the Prime MlnislvGr3s promise, that no time should be lost in negotiating the terms of the Treaty with the Iraq Government and obtaining the approval of the Iraq parliament to     The original draft of the new Treaty was prepared while the Secretary of State for -fohe Colonies was in Geneva in consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs..     Its effect was merely to continue in operation the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of October 1Q22 and the subsidiary agreements, in so far as their duration depended on that of the Treaty, for a period of 25 years or for such shorter period as might elapse before Iraq obtained admission to the league of Cations.      The text of this draft, slightly modified as a result of interdepartmental discussion, was telegraphed on the 25th of December to the&apos;Acting High Commissioner for Iraq, who at once approached King Peisal and the Prime Minister of Iraq2c
SIon the subject.     As tho result of subsequent tele-graphic correspondence, Mr, Amcry agreed to the inclusion of two additional Articles,  designed to meet the suscapti-bilities of the Iraq Government and to secure a. smooth passage for the Treaty in Iraq,      The additional artIo-)es are numbered 2 and 3 in the text of the Treaty, as printed in the Appendix to this memorandum,      The first fNoV2) merely provides for a continuance of discussions which have beast in progress for some time past- regarding the possibility of amending the financial and military agreements in certain particularso    The second (N0c3) provides for periodic review.,, beginning in 1^28 and there-after at intervals of 4 years,  of two questions, namely, whether it is possible to press for the admission of Iraq to the league of Nations, and if not, whether,  on account of the progress made by tho Kingdom of Iraq or for any other reason, the amendment of the subsidiary agreements is warranted.    Before the new Articles were agreed to the concurrence&apos;of the Treasury and Foreign Office in their terms was obtained..    They do not necessarily commit His Majesty;s Government either to accept any amendment of tho subsidiary agreements or to press for the admission of Iraq to membership of the League,    In these respects they go no further than Articles XVIII and VI of theTreaty of 19220In order that there should bo no misunderstanding as to the effect of the v.c\i Treaty upon the pro-visions cf the military and financial agreements;, the Acting High Commissioner has been instruoted to address a letter to the Iraq Government making It clear that, in accordance with Article I of the new Treaty,
the subsidiary agreements are not affected except in so far as their duration depends upon that of the main Treaty-;  and consequently that the principle enunciated in Articles 1 and 3 of the military and financial agreementrespectively,   (Viz,  that Iraq shall accept as soon as possible, and in any Case not later than 4 years from, th? date of the agreementP  full military and financial responsibility for the preservation of Internal order and for the defence of Iraq against foreign aggression)  remains In force.cThe new Treaty was signed at Baghdad on the loth January,  1926,  and will at once be submitted to the Iraq Parliament for acceptancec   * The signed copies will not,  of course,  reach the Colonial Office for some days;    but the text,  as printed in the Appendix, has been carefully revised in the light  of the telegraphic correspondence and may be taken as accurateoMr0 Amery contemplates publishing the text of the Treaty as a Parliamentary paper imrrediatelv on its receipt from Baghdad/     It will probably be desirable also to publish,  as part of the Parliamentary- paper,  a brief introductory memorandum explaining the exact effect of the new Treatv upon British commitments..Colonial Office,14th January  1926.
