This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty1s Government.)Tj! C RET.CABINET.P. 76(26).IllDISQUALIFICATION OF PERSONS RECEIVING POOR RELIEF.FROM VOTING AT ELECTIONS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.The Cabinet at their Meeting on the 10th instant, upon consideration of a Memorandum CP.50(26) circulated by the Minister of Health, decided that a Bill should be prepared dealing with certain matters affecting the administration of the Poor Laws, and that the Bill should Include some provision for the disfranohisement of persons who have received poor reliefvoting at elections of Boards of Guardians, As the Minister primarily responsible for franchise and electoral questions,   I &apos;have to bring to the notice of my colleagues some points on which a decision will be wanted before this part of the Bill can be drafted.1.    First,  is the disqualification to extend to elections for rural district councillors?    By section 23 of the Local Government Act,  1894, rural district councillors represent the parish or area for which they are elected on the Board of Guardians,  and while so acting are deemed to be guardians.    I may say that representations have been received by me that the Poor Relief disqualification (removed by the Representation of the People Act, 1918) should be restored for elections of all local authorities and for parliamentary elections,  not only for elections of Guardians.2.    The old disqualification provision was not altogether satisfactory.    By it,  a person was disqualified for being registered as an elector if he had received poor relief during any part of the qualifying period for which the register was prepared, viz. the twelve months ending on the 15th July preceding&quot;kVsyh
-2-*AB.l fc^rf1the calendar year for which the register was in for-ce.    It often happened,  therefore, that persons who last received relief over two years before an election could not vote whilst others who were actually receiving relief at the time of the election were on the register and could vote and their votes could not be disallowed on scrutiny.Further, the contemplated single register with a qualifying period of three months will create some difficulty as to the form-the disqualification should take.    If the same principle is adopted a3 under the old system,  i.e. disqualifica-tion on the ground of relief during the qualifying period,  it would result, under a single register,  that those persons only would be disqualified who received relief during one particular quarter of the year.I suggest, therefore, for consideration whether a new method should not be adopted.    The simplest and most rational seems to me to disqualify persons who receive relief during some fixed period prior to the election.    This method, which would accord with the law in force before parliamentary and local elections were held by ballot, would entail some inter-ference with the principles of registration and the Ballot Act under which any registered elector is entitled to receive a ballot paper,  but the difficulty does not seem a serious one. The Registration Officer,  it is suggested,  should obtain from the Poor Law Authority    14 days before the election   the names of all persons who had received relief during the period specified and should be authorized before the election to strike the names Off the register.The fixed period, relief during which should disqualify, might run from the commencement of the qualifying period for the register on which the election is fought up to the date of the election.    This would have the result of excluding all permanent paupers from the register before it is made up, and so reducing considerably the number of names to be struck off later.
An alternative course would be simply to take proceedings against disqualified persons who vote - a person prohibited by statute from voting commits an illegal practice if he does soi but it is doubtful whether it would be a wise policy to enforce the law in this way. Prosecutions would be unpopular with all parties and convictions might be difficult to secure.3,    Where a man is the occupier, his wife&apos;a qualification for the parliamentary and local Government franchise depends on his right to the latter franchise.    Is relief given to the husband to affect her right to vote?4.    is medical relief to disqualify?   Formerly medical relief disqualified for voting at election of Guardians,  though not at other elections, but when the Local Government Act 1894 applied the register of parochial (i.e. Parliamentary and Local Government) electors to the election of Guardians,  the disqualification became inoperative in practice.5.    Is relief given on loan to disqualify;    or relief given to a man&apos;s family whilst he is receiving medical relief;    or relief by way of maintenance of a dependant relative in a lunatic or idiot asylum?6.    Is relief given for a period of less than one month during the specified period to disqualify?I would suggest that the consideration of these points -and any others that may arise - should be referred to a Cabinet Committee.    But in the first instance the Cabinet should decide definitely whether action is to be confined to the case of Boards of Guardians (and possibly Rural District Councils):    there will undoubtedly be pressure from certain quarters to extend the disqualification to other elections.17th February,  192S.
