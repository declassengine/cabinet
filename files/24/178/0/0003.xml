CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,^QjMgMggT. IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,On November 12th, 1924, the Cabinet decided that it would be inconsistent with the attitude towards Russia taken up by MOmberB of the present Government during the general election to sanction the equipment of Soviet Russia with arms and ammunition of British manufacture. Sinco the date of this decision, all applications for the oxportation of war materials to the Soviet Union have been consistently refused.On October Slst last Messrs, vickers addressed to the Foreign Office a letter (of which a copy is annexed) enquiring whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to consider the grant of a licence for the supply to the Soviet Government of smaii coast defence vessels and submarine mines stated to be required purely for defensive purposes.    Having regard to the above mentioned decision such a licence would normally be refused, but it appears to me that the application is one which it might be expedient to grant for the following reasons to which I invite my colleagues consideration -(l) The Cabinet decision undoubtedly related primarily to the export to Russia of offensive weapons, the supply of armaments     of a purely defensive character is obviously not open to objections of the same force.(2) The Admiralty are understood to take the view both In regard to mines and to coast defence vesselr; that the transaction is desirable.    They refer to the desirabilitySECRET;,;C A B I NET.CP.  3  (26)SUPPLY OF COAST DEFENCE VESSELS AND SUBMARINEMINES TO RUSSIA.
of Keeping Messrs. Vickers Naval Construction Works at Barrow occupied and to the fact that Russia will undoubtedly obtain her requirements from another country if British firms are refused an export licence.    In the case of submarine mines in particular they regard it to be preferable that Russia should be in possession of mines, the characteristics of which are known to us rather than those of foreign manufacture, the nature of which is uncertain and which may therefore cause considerable trouble if the mine field has to be swept on some future occasion.(3) Whilst direct measures of unemployment relief are being reduced, employment In the shipbuilding Industry remains at the lowest stage of depression so that we should think twice before letting slip an opportunity of affording  It increased employment.(Intd.)
