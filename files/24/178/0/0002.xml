The pithesS   price for November is not yet kn wn, but the f,o,b, value of export coal took a turn upwards for the first time since April.The demand for export co: 1 from the North East Coast is well maintained, and South Wales has been helped recently by an Important revival In demand from South America.      Prices generally have risen or steadied.      Ibe house coal trade, which did not show any signs of life until wid-November, is now very vigorous, and this,  together with the Impetus to production always given by the approach of the Christmas holidays, no doubt accounts for the big jump in output during tie last three weeks.      The last figure  (5,428,300) is the highest since the 31st January. -1&quot;

J a nuar y ,  19 2 6.The strike of anthracite miners in the United States still continues, although ir for nation fr m a reliable source indicates that work nay bo res&quot;wed very shortly and the threatened . stoppage in the Belgian, coalfield j.s new stated in the Press to have been averted by the men&apos; s accepting a reduction in wages. The Belgian Embassy has recently been making enquiries about the precise manner in which, our  Subvention is administered.Cost of Subvention.      There is nothing at present to add to what was stated in the v/hite Paper presented to Parliament at the tip-so when tire Supplementary Estimate was taken,  except that the unexpectedly sharp increase in output may mean some excess on our estimate for -December,  but will p.ake it more like 137- that we shall be within our/forecast for February and march.Overtures by Germany .      I annex a note of a.n interview that I have had with representatives of the west.pha.lian Syndicate I have sent a copy  to Sir -Herbert Samuel.Roya1 Commission.     The Commission had adjourned until the first week in January, when they will hear the only important evidence still remaining to be heard - the hining Association and Miners&apos;  Federation on their respective remedies for the present economic condition of the industry.      The Commission have  sketched out a scheme of their report but have not yet, I believe, come to any conclusions.      Their programme is to present their report at the end of February.O.RhL.Fo
Note of an interview on the 27th November, 1925, between Herr Georg I lib sen and herr A. Janus, of the \&apos;.estphalian Syndicate, and Colonel Lane Pox and LrtGowers0The Germans said that they had come to the conclusion, after examining l)r.Voegler1 s scheme for the formation of a pool by means of an export tax, that it was quite unworkable. Their experience led them to the conviction that any form of co-operation between Germany and England in the coal export trade was quite impossible unless we established organisations in our export districts controlling production and sales on similar lines to the&apos;westphalian Syndicate.    If that were done co-operation could be arranged - given the will - without any tax or any Government interference.    If it were not done,  no form of Government action could bring about effective co-operation... They asked whether we agreed.    we yeplied that we had already come to the same conclusion but had hoped to be shown that we were wrong0The Germans pointed out that it was impossible to disguise the fact that an arrangement of the bort that they had in mind would have the object of benefiting England and Germany at the expense of all other European countries - France and Italy in particular.    They expressed the fear that if an attempt were made to bring it about by Government action the political difficulties would prove insuperable.    They therefore emphasised-sised the importance of leaving the matter if possible,  to the industrials of the two countries, &quot;the Governments standing aside.    They asked If home dlJcushidn between them and leading members of the industry would be likely to do any good at this stage.    We agreed in principle that this was the better way to do it but told them that no progress at all could be made on those lines at present;  it might be taken as quite certain that, without Government  pressure,  or an economic pressure   uch keener than anything they had yet felt,  our Coal-owners would not listen to any proposals for selling co-operatively instead
of competitively,  even among themselves.    Ac to the former, we could, not give them any indication of what&quot;, if anything, the Government might do, but we emphasised more than once that if any pressure were brought to bear it would be not on the ground that this was a step towards an understanding with Germany but merely on the ground that co-operative celling within the British - coal trade was intrinsically better than competitive selling, leaving open the question whether such syndicates, if established, would be used as a weapon of competition against Germany or as a means of co-operation with her.    The Germans entirely concurred in this view.     The establishment  of syndicates was in their view the essential first step,  even though their primary purpose might be competition with Germany; once they were established they were quite content to see what they oould do by negotiation with them,.We pointed out that, in present circumstances, the moot effective impetus that could &quot;be given to the establishment of a system of co-operative selling in this country would be a recommendation in its favour b . the Royal Commission,      We ashed whether, if the Commission desired it, the kestphalian -Syndicate would be willing to depute someone to give evidence as to its history,  constitution, methods,  and the advantages claimed for the system.    They seemed favourably disposed towards the suggestion, but said that they would like to think Lt  over before giving a definite answerB
