P.C-L.Board of Trade,15th February, 1926.
5 Q ljSAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES APPLICATION (IRON  AND STEEL ).&quot;&apos; 5 &quot; 1. Wire.1. The original Safeguarding of Industries application made by the steel industry included wire rods in a section dealing with heavy steel products generally, wire, wire netting and woven wire constituted a section of the same application? and a separate application has been made in respect of wire nails and shoe rivets.2.   The application now suggested is in respect of Iron and steel wire, wire netting and woven wire and possibly also wire rods. The production and trade in wire rods and wire are shown in the following tables:--;-f IRS     RODS.				r.	Production. Tons.	Retained Imports. Tons.	Exports. Tons.	Home Con-sumption.

The trade is clearly one of &quot;substantial importance&quot; but it is by no means clear that the wire industry as a whole satisfies the conditions of the A&apos;hite Paper regarding abnormal competition.4. Before the war a large part of the wire rod used in this country was imported, as was also a substantial quantity of wire. During the war the wire industry in common with many other branches of the iron and steel
trade was expanded and the capacity for production in 5f fy J[ this country is now much greater than it was before the war.     Much of the present capacity is idle.5.        The imports of wire rods have been increasing rapidly during the last few years and in 1925 exceeded those of 1913,     The imports for the 4 quarters of 1925 were 24,053 tons, 21,376 tons, 33,949 tons and 34,478 tons. The home production is greater than in 1913, but is decreasing.6.     The position with regard to wire is similar. Imports have increased until they are now above the 1913 level, but home production consumption and exports are also above the pre-war level.7.       A large proportion of the wire rod and wire produced In this country Is made by a comparatively small number of large concerns which produce their own raw material, but there is a considerable number cf small wire-drawing establishments and doubtless the imported wire rods go in the main to the latter.8. wire has a gr*eat many uses.     Among the obviouslylarge uses for wire are wire nails (say 10,000 tons a year) wire netting (30,000 tons) wire rope and cables (consumption not known but may be estimated as some SO,000 tons) and wire fencing (again estimated at some 50,000 tons). Making allowance for imports and exports of wire there would appear to be some 100,000 to 150,000 tons of wire to be accounted for among other using industries.     Wo definite statistical information is available as to the amount used by any one trade but the number of trades is very large. Examples of uses ai*e:- armouring electric cables, re-in forcing concrete, piano wire, bookbinding wire, fibre case-making wire, wire wheels, aeroplanes, telegraph and railway signal wire, wire wound ordnance, pins and needles, paper clips, some light tools such as screwdrivers, springs, and spring mattresses, chains, mouse traps and bird cages
% fl 2sieves, fire and lamp guards, handles for many articles such as paint cans, wire baskets, reinforced glass, clothes pegs and meat skewers.9. Although these industries in the main must use home produced wire some of them must use imported wire, and there would doubtless be a demand for a system of draw-backs on exports.    It is not possible to give any definite indication of the volume of exports made wholly or partly of wire, since many of the articles fall under headings other than that of &quot;Other manufactures of wire&apos;1. We understand that in the case of one of the most important exports, wire ropes and cables, British wire is almost wholly used on account of its high quality and in that case the question of drawback might not arise, but as regards all other commodities made of wire there would almost certainly be a demand for a scheme of export drawbacks, which we regard as virtually impracticable. (See par 20 et seq.)10. There is a large import trade in articles made of or containing \vire, and the British manufacturer of many competitive articles would probai)ly ask for compensatory import duties, although in the case of many composite articles such duties would be extremely difficult to administer.11. In the event of its being decided that an application cannot be entertained in respect of the wire industry generally it may be desirable to examine the separate branches of the wire manufacturing industry to see if separate applications with regard to any of them would be likely to be successful.12. We have information for some of these industries, separate applications having been made in respect of wire netting, woven wire and wire nails (including shoe rivets).-5-

13. Statistics of the imports and exports for pre-war years are not available for the wire netting and woven wire trade but in any case neither industry would appear to be of &quot;substantial importance&quot; within the meaning of the White Paper,  taking into consideration only the number of men employed in making netting from wire.    The same remarks apply generally to wire nails and shoe rivets.14. The wire rope and cable industry may be of &quot;substantial importance&quot; but imports are insignificant. Information regarding the wire fencing industry is not complete but it would seem probable that much of the ordinary strand wire is indistinguishable from other wire and that the barbed wire industry does not employ so many men as say the wire netting industry.    It would therefore not appear that these branches of the trade would be likely to be successful in making separate applications under the White Paper.    It must be added that in all oases the products of the sections of the wire trade to some extent form the materials of other trades and would no doubt lead to claims by them for schemes of drawbacks and for compensatory customs duties.2. Joists.15.   An initial difficulty is that the scope of the proposed application has not yet been defined.    The trade returns now 3 how joists, girders, beams and pillars as one aggregate and this heading covers generally the H steel sections used in building construction In bridges, etc. and to some extent in shipbuilding. Associated with these sections of the trade are others such as angles, tees, channels and bars which also find extensive use in many other industries such as mechanical engineering and shipbuilding.
1913............ 282,000 108,000 121,8701922............ 215,000 39,000 58,7371923............ 309,000 61,000 76,8471924............ 290,800 88,000 72,6381925............ 310,000 108,000 64,09116. It is reasonable to assume that this Industry oan shew that it passes the test of substantial importance.      Imports have been increasing rapidly inrecent years, and are now approximately equal in quantity to the 1913 imports. Exports have fallen but production has slightly increased.All these products form the material of other industries, being used particularly in construction of large buildings and bridges.    Some of the products probably find their way into ship and barge building although this may not be a large use.    Some of the lighter sections are used in building barns and houses. This material is used alBo in smaller quantities in special work such as crane or conveyor building.    It is contended by the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers that only a small proportion of the foreign material is re-exported after being worked.    In so far as it is so exported drawbacks might be asked for, but probably the drawback problem Is considerably less important than in the case of wire (see par. 9).17.    The trade in other structural sections is larger.     The Manufacturers1 Federation group joists and girders with sections, angles, channels, tees, rounds, squares, flats and hexagons.   Relative statistics for the whole olass are:-The available information regarding joists, girders, &amp;c. is as follows.-RetainedProduction. Impor ts. Exports.Tons. Tons. Tons.

But with this extension of the application to cover angles,  etc., a much wider range of materials for other industries would be affected and there would be demands for import duties on manufactured articles containing these materials and for export drawbacks.
III. Effect on other sections of the Iron and Steel. Trade.19.    It is understood that these two applications have been put forward by the Iron and Steel Trade Federation as affording the best instances of self-contained branches of the Industry where a protective duty could be granted without entailing extension to other sections of the trade.   But as already pointed out (para. 15) there are indications that the application in the case of joists may be extended to the associated groups of angles, bars, etc. which form one of the larger and more elementary sections of the trade, and it would not be a long step from these to plates, sheets, etc.     In the case of wire, if all wire manufactures are Included, the line of demarcation from other branches of the trade is perhaps more clearly cut.     But even wire would not be free from complications.     For instancej if wire nails are protected, why not other iron nails; if spring mattresses, why not the whole bedstead.IV. Drawback.20.   In view of Its very material bearing on the problem,   it has been thought desirable to explain the position as regards drawback somewhat at length.21.   In the case of the McKenna, Key Industry,  and Safeguarding Duties., which are Customs duties only, with no countervailing Excise, the law requires the following conditions to be satisfied before drawback is payable on exported goods, viz:-(a) that the goods have not been used in thiscountry;   and(b) that the goods are the same goods as those on which duty was paid, o22,   As regards (a) it is not the practice to
TOWWrtiliiiiiW Si&apos;.Interpret &quot;use&quot; as use in manufacture and therefore to rule out claims for drawback on the sole ground that the article in question has been so used. The &quot;use&quot; which is a bar to drawback is what may be called consumers&apos; use, e.g. a camera used to take photographs, or a knife which has been used at table.23.    The practice as regards (b) has been to regard goods as the &quot;same goods&quot; only so long as they have not changed their form in process of manufacture in this country, and are still identifiable as the goods on which duty was originally paid.       The ground for the law as thus interpreted is that the detection of fraudulent substitution of the duty-free home product for the duty-paid imported product, while not easy even in the case of articles exported in the form imported, is virtually impracticable where the article changes its form and is exported as something different,24.   Following this rule in the case of wire, drawback would be payable on wire netting, wire coat hangers, or other wire manufactures, or on wire itself; if exported in the form in which imported, but would not be payable on the export of wire drawn from Imported wire rods, or of coat hangers or netting or a multitude of other articles such as those mentioned in paragraph 8, manufactured In this country from Imported wire.25.    To withhold drawback in such cases would clearly impose a handicap on the export trade, and. afford ground for complaint by traders.     On the other hand, any scheme for the payment of drawback where duty-paid wire rods or ivire had been used in the manufacture of other goods, possiblyiin conjunction with similar home-produced material which will have paid no duty, presents difficulties which appear to be insurmountable, if it is on the one hand to avoid impossible requirements from traders and on
the other to provide even moderate safeguards against fraud on the Revenue.25. Moreover, if the  attempt were made it would inevitably create a demand for similar facilities in the case of all other goods liable to McKenna Key. Industry, and Safeguarding Duties, and the prospect would have to he faced of drawback claims on exported articles containing, or alleged to contain, imported chemicals of any one or more of the 6,000 varieties which pay K.I.D. if, and only if, they are imported.26. The position, therefore, is that if a safeguarding duty is imposed on imports of wire, important classes of the export trade must he prepared to forego drawbacks,27,. It will be appreciated that the case is essentially different from that of goods containing, say artificial silk or sugar, on which there is  an Excise as well as a Customs duty, and in the manufacture of which therefore there is no possibility of duty-free materials having been used.    To modify the established Revenue practice In the case of goods liable only to duty if imported, would be a highly dangerous precedent and the case of a purely temporary duty such as that now under discussion would in any event not be en appropriate opportunity to introduce so important an innovation.28. As regards the case of joists and girders, it is improbable, from the nature of the use to which they are put, that there is any considerable export of imported articles of this description, and the drawback problem is therefore probably not of major importance.   Moreover, it is not likely that these articles change their form in the course of manufacture,  and If it were necessary to give a drawback, the existing practice should meet the case.
