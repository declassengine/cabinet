-CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.!Printed for the Cabinet.   January 192.6.SECRET.CP. 7 (26). &apos;, &apos; a&apos; yCIRCULATED  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.AFGHANISTAN.Previous papers: CP. 517 (25), CP. 521 (25).Telegram, -from TIM. Minister, Kabul, to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,4th December 1925: *No. 154- 2nd December. I shall be glad to receive early instructions as to the attitude I should adopt on the question raised in Viceroy&apos;^ telegram, 1255, dated 7th October, to Secretary of State for India [vide CP. 517 (2.5)]. It is reported on good authority that the Amir intends to spend two or three months at Jalalabad this winter, and it is probable that he will wish to take with -him aeroplanes and Russian air personnel to complete the Jalalabad aerodrome, construct hangars and carry air mails between Jalalabad and Kabul. I.suggest, that 1 should inform the Foreign Minister at once that His Majesty&apos;s Government would consider as unfriendly and provocative in effect (1) Flying by Russians in the vicinity of Indo-Afghan -border or anywhere east of Jalalabad or Ghazni or south-east of Kandahar.(2) Construction of hangars in eastern-southern Ghazni or Kandahar Province, for use by Russian personnel.&apos; (3) Presence of the Russian air personnel in eastern-southern Giiazni or Kandahar Province, except for carrying air mail for Amir when on tour away from the capital. .&quot;It appears that as a result.of my private warning to Minister of War last August,. Amir refused permission to Russians on recent Kandahar tour to fly near the Indian frontier or to remain behind in Kandahar or Ghazni to construct aerodromes, and it is important that I should make early representations to avoid awkward fait accompli at Jalalabad.In view of the last sentence of letter 3 attached to the Treaty, it would; be impossible to convince Amir of the reasonableness of our objections to Russian airmen being associated temporarily with his visit to outlying provinces.He will certainly contest even those stipulations which I have suggested above and might even seize the opportunity to denounce the Treaty. But in my opinion the time has come to make it clear to Amir that we will not tolerate Russian air bases near the Indian frontier.Telegram from TT.M. Minister, Kabul, to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,llth December 1925.No. 159. 9th December. I offer the following observations on the Secretary of State for India&apos;s telegram to the Viceroy, 3187fvide CP. 517 (25)], which crossed my telegram No. 154.Vital question is whether the establishment of permanent air base at Jalalabad,. Ghazni, or Kandahar, manned wholly or partially by Russians, would constitute present or future menace to Indian interests.In political sense I would unhesitatingly answer in the affirmative, since I believe that such bases would develop quickly into foci of anti-British intrigue, and their activities would be more difficult to watch and counteract than those of consulates, which are restricted by international law. In military sense I am hot competent to judge, but large increase in. Royal Air Force budget in India would presumably be considered necessary.On the assumption that the menace, present, or potential, is held to exist, I am convinced that it will be wise to litter warning without delay. This warning, I suggest, should be orally and informally given in terms indicated in my telegram No. 154, without mentioning that His Majesty&apos;s Government would take their stand on the Treaty in case it was not accepted. Warning would probably be resented at first, but I think it possible to persuade the Amir and Foreign Minister at, present stage, when there is no fear that it will upset a fait accompli, that it is not. unreasonable or inconsistent, for it would be in consonance with the spirit, of the Treaty and of the negotiations that preceded it. Moreover, Amir would know where he stood and be able to comply without humiliation. There is much force in argument., that there would be risk of renewing Amir&apos;s hope that he had discovered in our &apos; 903      LOO&apos;     1.26 &apos;   . &apos; - -&apos;
objection suitable subject for bargaining, and possibly of causing him to denounce the Treaty in anticipation of obtaining better terms in ensuing negotiations. But if Russians were permanently installed at Jalalabad, Amir could use this lever with still greater advantage. &apos; , .It. is also true that the Amir&apos;s suspicions may be aroused that we are deliberately interfering with development of the Afghan Air Force as such, particularly as the prohibition in regard to German personnel is to be maintained, but I could explain that the Treaty of Versailles was in force long before this question arose, and that we are not free agents in the- matter; also that the principle of exclusion of Russians-from the south-eastern zone, except on temporary visits, is necessary condition of British friendship, and is implicit in Anglo-Afghan Treaty.I consider that there is good chance that my warning would produce the desired effect, and if it were apparently unheeded for a time I do not contemplate having to use the weapon of detention of arms in India, even if the Afghans allowed it to be available. Fresh warning and increased, pressure before matter had gone too far should be sufficient to gain our point ; and I have reason to believe, now that the survey of the Khyber-Kabul road has been successfully launched, that Amir would be very sensitive to hint of closing down of British assistance on this road.I am willing to face the risk of my representations resulting in the deterioration of relations, because I feel not only that I am on firm ground, but that delay is much more dangerous. If no warning is given now, it may be confidently anticipated that Russian air personnel will attempt to dig themselves in first at Jalalabad and later at Kandahar, to be followed perhaps by Vneshtorg agents ; and once established it will be far more difficult to remove them, for Afghans would then consider our demands unreasonable.Amir would be more likely to respond to warning that he would be charged with unfriendliness towards Great Britain than to an appeal to self interest in regard to clearer perception of Russian aggressive designs so far from his northern frontier.British policy in regard to Afghan Air Force. A very influential Sardar recently remarked to me that Afghans were trying to fly before they could walk, that every rupee spent on the air force was thrown down a well, and that there was strong dissatisfaction among the educated classes at a fighting arm being in the control of a (corrupt group). I see no reason for doubting the sincerity of this statement, which would apply equally to British as to Russians.Of the three carefully selected Afghans, who spent three years in Italy at an aviation school, two were not permitted to fly at all, and third was a hopelessly inefficient pilot and has never flown since his return to Kabul, more than a year ago. It may safely be predicted that three years would be minimum course required in England for youths so profoundly deficient in education and capacity for hard work, and, withal, so vain and unpractical as the present-day Afghan. On this showing, even if the experiment were successful, it would cost about  5,000, including messing expenses, to turn out an Afghan pilot. It seems doubtful whether the expenditure on such an object could be said to be ha the interests of the British Empire. *&quot;*Two years ago I stated in a despatch that in present conditions, and in any that can be foreseen, an effective Afghan air force is a. chimera. Subsequent experience has strengthened this opinion. The present force of 12 efficient machines has been created by the Amir for self aggrandisement, and he is being encouraged by the Russians for purposes of their own to increase it. He knows perfectly well that any force he could maintain wdth Afghan personnel- would be useless against Russia or India, or even to quell internal disorder. lie has admitted to me that Russian controlled force would be a danger rather than help in a serioxis rebellion. It is true that timely arrival of two British machines in August 1924 probably saved his capital, but this was due partly to novelty of aeroplanes and chiefly to belief of tribes that the British were supporting Amir.The fact is that Afghanistan, which cannot find money to provide its miserably-equipped infantry and artillery with the barest necessities, or to keep ,important, roads in ordinary repair, cannot dream of affording an air force, nor can she find brains or capacity for its technical personnel.My recommendation is that British effort should be directed not to establishing British connection with an Afghan air force, but to restricting, by fair and reasonable means (in general interests of Afghanistan as well as of India), sphere of Russian., activity with that force. This should lead ultimately to disappearance of Russian personnel and Afghan military air force will die natural and unlamented death.With novelty wearing off and a lighter pocket Amir might become reconciled to-, possession of, say, four aeroplanes, which could accompany him on his tours and take-: part in ceremonial displays.   Pilots in charge would have to be foreigners for many
327years to come. This is all that Amir can afford without foreign subsidy. British -co-operation in civil aviation might be advisable at a later stage.As Amir is expected to leave for Jalalabad before end of-December, I request early orders. , -Telegram from H.M.

Translation is as follows :-&quot; We have heard that excitement has been caused in Government political and military circles by the news received recently of aggression by a military -detachment of the United Soviet Republics on our sacred motherland at a place called Darqad, in the province of Badakshan, and the killing there of the commander of an Afghan post. The anxiety and indignation caused to us by receipt of news of this sudden attack is most stunning. We have tried to obtain details, which will be published when received.&quot;It is rumoured that the garrison as well as the commander of the Afghan post have been killed by the Russians, and that Sardar Suliman Jan, the Governor, has been disgraced by the local inhabitants. ;The First Kabul Brigade is under orders to leave immediately for the north.

Foreign Department. Your telegram No. 3187 [vide CP 517 (25)]. We are keenly alive to the force of the objections you advance to our proposals for direct counter measures against Russian penetration. Attitude of friendly indifference towards the Amir&apos;s flirtations with Russians is the theoretical ideal which -we have endeavoured to pursue in the past. Nevertheless, after reviewing this difficult problem in the light of your criticisms and giving all the weight we can to the probability of Russian failure to maintain Afghan Air Force for long, we feel that, in this particular case, gamble is one which we are not justified in facing. For we are clear that establishment of Russian-controlled air station at Jalalabad, or elsewhere in the four provinces in the south-eastern zone, would constitute a serious addition to our military menace, and, combined with routine flying by Russians along our North-West Frontier, a political menace similar in kind to, but much more serious than, russia Consulates in Jalalabad, Kandahar, and Ghazni.At the same time, though we think we must be prepared in the last resort to refuse transit of munitions to Afghanistan and to face the consequent straining of relations, we readily agree that we should approach the subject with the Afghans -orally and as informally as possible. Indeed, while we agree generally with the Ministers telegrams Nos. 154 and 159, we think that we should studiously confine ourselves to objecting to the presence of Russian aviators in the south-eastern zone except on occasional visits by the Amir (vide the analogy of the Russian Minister) and actual operations against rebellious tribes as in Khost last year, and should -studiously avoid language like that in his second point in Katodon 15:1, which could be interpreted as dictating to Afghans internal. disposition of their forces. We recognise that tbe Ministers difficulties in this&apos; respect will be increased if the Tersailles Treaty embargo on Germans cannot in some small measure be lifted, and

In general we-feel that we ought not to go out of our way to facilitate maintenance of Afghan Air-Force while it remains in Russian control. We should do everything we are bound to do under the Treaty and nothing more.Telegram from II.M. Minister, Kabul, to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,2-kh December 1925.No. 1G4. 23rd December. My telegram No. 163. Extraordinary issue of Aman-i-Afghan, dated 21st December, states that Stark had very long interview with Tarzi on the night of 20th December, and former undertook on behalf of his Government: that .Russians should immediately evacuate occupied territory of Darqad, Bostan,. Shaftalubuz and Qulabad.   Paper expresses satisfaction at this happy result.Russian personnel in charge of Air Force have been temporarily suspended, and Amir is said to have ordered erection of anti-aircraft battery as a menace to his-own aeroplanes. It is reported that eight Afghans were killed and five captured in the, affray, and that Afghan territory to distance of 16 miles from the border is still in possession of Russians. Stark spent nearly whole of 21st and 22nd December at the Foreign Office and, in spite of his reported protest,, an Afghan regiment left Kabul last night for Faizabad. I have received no reliable information to substantiate-local rumour that rebellion has broken out in Badakshan.Telegram from II.M. Minister, Kabul, to Secretary of Stale for Foreign Affairs,21th December 1925.No. 165. 23rd December. Government of l.ndia&apos;s telegram to the Secretary of State-for India, 1708 S. Apparently the second point of my telegram 154 was obscurely worded. What I propose to say to Foreign Minister is : &quot; If you mean to build hangars in Jalalabad, Ghazni, or Kandahar, you should take note beforehand that His-Majesty&apos;s Government would object to permanent occupation of those hangars by Russians:&quot;Anything less definitive than this would give opportunity to Tarzi for wriggling-later on. Latest developments, reported in my telegram No. 164, indicate that the-Amir has become alive to the danger of Russian-controlled air force, and it is possible that the warning may prove to be unnecessary, at any rate for the present. All I require is discretion to utter the warning at the right moment.Telegram from Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to FI.M. Minister, Kabul,21th December 1925.41. Your telegram dated 9th December, No. .159. Proposed oral and informal&apos; warning to Afghan G-overnment is approved subject to substitution of words &quot;would regard very unfavourably &quot; for words &quot; would consider as unfriendly and provocative in effect,&quot; and to modifications suggested in Government of India&apos;s telegram, dated. .21st December, No. 1708 S.Telegram from TI.M. Minister, Kabul, to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,28th December 1925.No. 166. 26th December. My telegram No. 164, last paragraph. It is now-admitted by Afghan officials that there is insurrection in Badakshan, apparently among-the Tajiks in the region of Rustak-Chahiab; extent not known, but Chief of the General Staff told Military Attache to-day that no news has been received from Badakshan since 21st December. Considerable amount of am munition is being sent from Kabul by night, and move of court and troops to Jalalahad has been countermanded for the-present. Yesterday Amir gave address from pulpit of principal Kabul mosque, in which he said that the Russians had constantly encroached upon Afghan soil in the-past, ancl that it was better to perish in the struggle for existence than wait to be swallowed piecemeal. He said that he had not only suspended the Russian air personnel, but was keeping them strictly under surveillance. As far as I am able to judge, the general opinion among Afghans in Kabul is that Russians, in spite of Starks friendly profession, intended to make territorial acquisition at expense of Afghanistan by revolutionary means, and that the Amir is helpless at this time of the year, when the passes in Hindu Kush are blocked by snow.
Telegram from H.M. Minister, Kabul, to Secretary of State for Foreign A.ffairs,1st January 1926.No. 169. 31st December. My telegram No. 166. I had long interview with Tarzi this morning at his request. He at once broached the subject of Russian aggression in Badakshan. I asked for the facts. He said that the Russians bad occupied the island of Urta Tagai in force and refused to evacuate it on the ground that their subjects who had taken refuge in Afghan territory had committed raids from there into country north of the Oxus. Russians had demanded local joint commission, to which Afghan Government objected until island was evacuated. He said that negotiations for amicable settlement were proceeding, but if Soviet Government proved intractable war would be only solution. He asked whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to help Afghanistan in the event of hostilities breaking out. I said that it would be madness for Afghanistan to go to war with Russia, and urged the necessity of settling the dispute by diplomatic methods. I assured him of sympathy of my Government in any question affecting-integrity of Afghanistan, and hinted that British diplomatic support might be available if it could be shown that Russia was in unwarrantable occupation of territory which belonged indisputably to Afghanistan. But -I warned him to be careful to avoid any action which might provoke Russia to hostilities. In reply to my question, Tarzi said that there were no internal disturbances, so far as he was aware, in any part of northern Afghanistan. This conflicts with the account given to Military Attache by Chief of General Staff on 26th December. Tarzi promised to keep me informed of developments, and said that he would continue to consult me. His hint about possibility of war was probably in nature of flourish, but account must be taken of hot-headedness of the Amir. Cabinet meetings are being held almost daily to discuss the situation. I recommend that if Afghan Government makes out a good case and asks for British diplomatic support, advisability be considered of taking-action on the lines of point (1) in Government of India&apos;s telegram to Secretary of State for India, 1323 S., which was inserted at my special request. It seems possible that well-timed British representations might prove of valuable assistance towards peaceful way of meeting the difficulty.90313
