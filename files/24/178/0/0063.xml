Ever since the end of November (allowance being made for the Christmas and Pew Year holidays) output has been at a rate no?; far below that of the &quot;boom&quot; year 1925 when the Ruhr coalfield was In French occupation^     As is usual on such occasions,  It is difficult to disentangle the causes and estimate their respective Importance.      Increased demand from the United States (or her ordinary customers) on account of the failure to settle the anthracite strike is one cause.      Some slight revival in our own heavy industries seems to be another.      But the principal cause is no doubt that large consumers both here and abroad are trying to make up stocks against a. possible stoppage in May.      Current prices, generally (though there are some exceptions) have show!   a strong&apos; upward tendency since the beginning of the year.The material figures showing the course of trade in the industry as a whole since the beginning of August pre as follows:-

In December  the cost was  3,465,000;    in January, as was expected,  the corner was turned, and a decrease in the gap led to the cost falling by  415..000 to  3,050,000,      In February the gap is again decreased, and,  if the present rate of output continues,  the cost will fall by a further  300,000 or so to about  2^750pOOO9      Progressive reductions in March and April may reasonably be hoped.for though this cannot be counted on with certainty since it is impossible to estimate the extent to which the recent rise in prices will prove to have been, offset by the expiry, at the end of December, of a considerable number of long contracts at pre.-Subvention prices.     The total bill for the 9 months is likely to fall between  22,000.000 and  24,000,000.      The amount voted for the present financial year will be insufficient to meet the cost for the eight months,
bat a further supplementary estimate will not be needed as thero is a normal lag of over  1,000,000 in payments,Interpretation of tie Terns of Settlement.    She Miners&apos; Federation have now definitely&apos; abandoned their claim that the terms of settlement of last July meant that basis rates could not be altered,     I&apos;1 ever the le sr.,  I have found it impossible to induce tie Mining Association to sign a National Agreement with them covering the Subvention period. I have suggested to the Federation that in these circumstances the case might be- met by a formal agreement between them and the Mines Department,      They fell in with this suggestion, and the episode has been closed by the signature of a document In which they accept our interpretation of thesettlement, and we give ti em an undertaking not to nayto collieries subvention/unless they observe its terms0Roya.1 0omm 1 ssion.      The Royal Commission have made good progress with, the recital/of their Report but have not yet,  I believe, reached agreement on their more important recommendations.      The Chairman still hopes that the Report will be out by the end cf February, but this,  in the circumstances seems ratter a sanguine expectation.     Neither the Mining Association nor &quot;the Miners1 Federation will make any move until the Report has been published.     Nor does it seem possible for the Government to do so,  since the points on which pressure may be brought to bear on one side or the other depend entirely on what the Commission may recommend.G.R.
