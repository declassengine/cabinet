THIS D0CUME1TT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS &quot;SRITAHHlMD- -MAJESTYTS 50 VSIIMEtfT.SECRET. ; Copy Ho.1 C A B t IT B T.CP.12 (26).Provisional Programme bf Scottish Legislation, 1926. Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.I submit for my colloaguos&apos;  information tho following-notes in connection with the legislative programme for 1926.1.     I desire to proceed urgently with the following Bills:-(a) Rating (Scotlandj Bill.    This has already been before the OaFinet (Cab.^Minutes 59 (25)) and was introduced at the end of last Session.(b) Criminal,Appeal (Scotland) Bill. This Bill follows the recoijDraendations of a Depart&apos;men taX&apos; Committee and gives to persons convicted on Indictment in Scotland rights of appeal similar to those conferred by the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, on persons convicted in England. The appeals will be to the High Court of Justiciary, not less than three Judges sitting for the disposal of any appeal.(c) Prisons ( Sectland).....Bill.     This is a small Bill todo away with the statutory requirement of public auction of a discontinued prison, and is required mainly In connection with the discontinuance of the Calton Prison, Edinburgh.(d) reorganisation ^zat^ipn of Offices (Scotland) Bill.,      A Bill for the reorganization of a number of Soofetish&quot;Departments and offices was introduced in 1923 and a similar Bill for these purposes made some progress in 1924.      I propose to aslc authority for the introduction of a new Bill dealing with similar objects though in some respects on rather difforent lines.Of these Bills it is expeoted that (b) and (c) will be unaontrovarsial,2.     Three useful Bills with which the Lord Advocate is concerned and whicjh should be uncontcntious should also be proceeded with.     These are -(a) Execution of Diligence (Scotland) Bill,.     This Bill &apos;   proceeds on the reports&quot; of a Departmental&quot; Committee and is*   designed to overcome the difficulties existing in parts of \   Scotland, in enforcing the judgments of tho Courts, owing tothe dearth in these parts of officers competent under theexisting law to enforce or execute judgments.(b) ffeu Duties and Xon^, Leases^ (Scotland) Bill.   This is designed to simplifyland tenure &quot;by enabling &quot;owners of land to commute feu duties (perpetual yearly payments).    It also enables a tenant to convert a long lease into a feu - and so acquire (subject to the interests of the ground landlord) a right of property.
(o)    Burgh Kegla t ars (Scot Ian A),. Bill *,     I&apos;ha oh j sot of this Bill is to&quot;discontinue, When opportunities arise., tho separate Burgh Registers of Sasines so that writs relating to land which are at present recorded in a Burgh Register shall he in future -recorded centrally.The two Bills last mentioned are suitable for introduction by Private Members and have been intimated as ouch to the WhipB.5,     In addition, pressure may be put upon me to bring in Bills on a number of ether matters, including a Bill dealing with Allotments cn the lines of the Allotments Act, 1925, whioh applies only to England and Wales.The re-introduction of the Sheriff Courts and Legal Officers (Scotland) Bill, -which obtained a second reading in the House of Commons last Session, and of the Rent Restrictions (Scotland) Bill will probably be dependent  on the extent to which agreement can be secured on these Bills.4e     Several Scottish Departmental Committees are dxie to report shortly, and legislation to give effect to their reoomenda-tlons will no doubt be necessary.     The Reports which will probably arouse most interest are these of the Committee on Sexual Offences against Children, cf the Committee on Juvenile Offenders, and af tho Committee cn Sheriff Court Records.      There may possibly be strong public demand for immediate action on one or mere of these Reports.&apos;J0H2? GILMOUR.&apos;oottish Office ,Whitehall&apos;, S.W. 1.15th January, 1926.
