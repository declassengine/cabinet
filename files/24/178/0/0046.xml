CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY;(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government.)CABINET. HOME    AFFAIRS    COMMITTEE. WILD BIRDS BILL. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.This Bill was -introduced in the Commons last Session but made no progress.      It is a consolidating and&quot; amending measure based upon the Report of a Departmental Committee of 1919 and upon subsequent suggestions from the Wild Birds Advisory Committee.      The existing law is inadequate and unsatisfactory in many respects and this is a non-Party Bill to whioh a great deal of thought has &quot;been given by Lord Grey of Fallodon;  the Chairman of the Advisory Committee, and others who are interested in this special subject.   - Such criticisms&apos; of the Bill as have reached me have been on points of detail and   do not affect the main provision.      I understand that certain-of the provisions of the Bill would be welcomed by the farmers.      I should be glad if time could be found for the Bill, and it might be included amongst the Bills to be introduced in the House of Lords.: W.J.H.SECRET,&quot; CP. 45  (26).5th February,  192S.
