IRAQ.(a.) Withdrawal of Two Infantry Battalions (&amp;.) Possible Action of League of Nations against Turkey&apos; in the Event of turkish Aggression (OLD. Papers Nos. 656-B, 660-B and 665-B.) (Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of 207th Meeting, Minute 1.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the following three Papers referring to Iraq : A memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air, regarding the retentionof an additional British Battalion in Iraq (C.I.D. Paper No. 665-B). The Report of Lord Balfour&apos;s Sub-Committee on Action by the League ofNations in the event of Turkish Aggression (C.I.D. Paper No. 656-B). A Report of the Advisory Committee on Trading and Blockade, regardingpossible action by the League of Nations to bring economic pressure tobear upon Turkey (C.I.D. Paper No. 660-B).SIR HUGH TRENCHARD stated that after the recent decision given by the League of Nations on the Iraq Frontier, the War Office had asked whether the Air Ministry was willing to liberate the British Battalion which had been retained in&apos;[14129-1]
2Iraq as a temporary measure at the time of relief. He considered, and in this view the Secretary of State for Air concurred, that no undue risk would be incurred by liberating this additional Battalion. As, however, a decision to retain the Battalion had been reached by the Committee of Imperial Defence and by the Cabinet, it was considered that the sanction of these two bodies should be obtained before the Battalion left Iraq. The main object in retaining this Battalion in Iraq had been as a safeguard against panic within that country. Conditions in Iraq itself were now quite stable, and its further retention, having regard to the expense and complications involved therein, did not appear to be justified. In regard to possibilities of external aggression, the retention of an additional Battalion would not materially diminish the risk which was inherent in the situation vis-a-vis Turkey.LORD CAVAN explained that the Battalion in question was without any first-line transport. Its value, therefore, in regard to a possible Turkish invasion was very small. Owing to the stable conditions now obtaining in Iraq there seemed no reasons for keeping this Battalion for purposes of internal security. If the Battalion was retained it would necessitate sending out drafts to replace time-expired men, and its removal after the close of the present trooping season would involve considerable expense.LORD BIRKENHEAD enquired whether the views expressed with regard to the British Battalion applied also to the Indian Battalion which had been retained in Iraq, and whether the Chief of the Air Staff viewed with equanimity the with-drawal of two Battalions from that country ? He was unable to follow the reasoning which based a conclusion in favour of withdrawal on the decision recently reached by the League of Nations at Geneva. If, for military purposes, the Battalions were practically valueless, why had their retention been urged in the first instance ? In his view the recent decision at Geneva had not removed or diminished the anxiety which the conditions on the Iraq frontier entailed.LORD CAVAN replied that the Battalion had been retained for purposes of internal security.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD said that similar considerations applied to the Indian as to the British Battalion and that he was prepared to accept the withdrawal of both these battalions.Mr. AMERY stated that, when the situation in Iraq had been previously discussed, attention had been drawn to the pending relief of the two Battalions as a cheap means of increasing the actual number of troops in Iraq. He thought that the decision of the League of Nations did influence the situation to this extent, that a greater measure of stability in Iraq itself had been secured thereby. Having regard to the increase which would be involved in the Middle East Vote and the incon-conveniences which would be occasioned if these Battalions were retained after the close of the trooping season, he thought that their retention in Iraq was not justified. Broadly speaking, His Majesty&apos;s Government^ policy in Iraq was based on the assumption that peace would be maintained ; that in the event of Turkish aggression immediate action hy the Air Force would stop any Turkish advance; and that ground forces should not be accumulated with a view to fighting a war on land. In these circumstances, the advantage of retaining what amounted to a small immobile unit was very slight indeed. He was prepared to agree with the air and military advisers, unless developments of a critical nature arose in the meantime, that the Battalions should be liberated. The internal situation in Iraq was stable, and he did not apprehend that any panic was likely to occur.LORD BIRKENHEAD stated that he understood the views of the Service advisers to be that, however critical the situation might be, the Battalions referred to were useless. Only a short time ago the General Staff had submitted a most alarmist report regarding the situation in Iraq. In the meantime nothing had occurred, in his view, which justified the assumption that the risk had disappeared or had diminished.Mr. CHURCHILL stated that he did not think there was any inconsistency in the views expressed by the General Staff some time ago and their attitude in regard to the removal of the Battalions now under consideration. The General Staff was of opinion that our position in Iraq was one of great weakness and danger. In order to remove that danger a force of at least two Divisions would be required in Iraq. The Government, however, was not prepared to adopt this course, since, in their view, to
despatch large land forces to Iraq was not the right way, nor was Mosul the right place to fight a war against Turkey. The presence of these two Battalions did not affect the situation, and, in his view, we should not incur the expenditure which their retention would involve, having regard to the opinions expressed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the military and air advisers. Should the Turks cross the Iraq boundary just when the Battalions were leaving Basra, their departure could be countermanded at once by means of a telegram. In the meantime he thought pre reparations should be made for their withdrawal, subject to reconsideration before these Battalions actually left the country.LORD BIRKENHEAD stated that he was not in the least convinced that the withdrawal of these two Battalions was advisable. The alarmist Report which had been submitted recently contemplated our air forces being driven back from the frontier. Should such a contingency arise we would be placed in a position of great difficulty. The Chief of the Air Staff and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had stated that the withdrawal of these Battalions made no difference to the risks which we were already incurring. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, on the other hand, considered that the Battalions were of some fighting value. In his view, in the event of a Turkish advance the two Battalions in question would be of considerable value. Since, however, he appeared to be in a minority of one in holding these views, he was prepared to accept the decision of the majority, subject to his opinions being placed on record. He enquired what was the latest date the Battalions would have to leave Iraq 1SIR HUGH TRENCHARD stated that two dates had been put forward by the War Office : embarkation at Bombay on the 25th February, which would mean leaving Baghdad on the 12th February; or embarkation at Bombay on the 12th March, which would involve leaving Baghdad on the 5th March.Mr. BRIDGEMAN stated that, since an advance by the Turks could not be carried out before March, reconsideration of the question at the time of the actual departure of the Battalions from Iraq would take place before any further information was available of possible Turkish intentions.Mr. AMERY remarked that if the Turks intended to invade Iraq in March they would begin to pile up reinforcements before that date.Mr. CHURCHILL added that it was possible in the meantime that satisfactory arrangements might have been negotiated with Angora. He suggested that a decision should be reached now in favour of the withdrawal of the two Battalions, which decision should be reconsidered before the 1st March, and either confirmed or cancelled according to the military and diplomatic situation obtaining at that time. In the meanwhile, all arrangements should be made on the assumption that the withdrawal would be carried outLORD CAVAN pointed out that if the withdrawal was cancelled at the last moment, expenses in regard to the shipping, which would have been pre-arranged, would nevertheless have to be met.Some further discussion* ensued on the reports before the Committee, in the course of which the question of bringing effective pressure to bear on Turkey, even through the instrumentality of the League of Nations, was emphasised.Conclusions. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (i.) That arrangements should be made for the withdrawal of the additional British battalion from Iraq at the latest possible date during the present trooping season. (Understood to be the 5th March as the date for leaving Baghdad.)(ii.) That this question should be re-examined by the Committee of Imperial Defence, in the light of the then existing military and political conditions, immediately prior to the actual departure of the battalion, (iii.) That the conclusions in (i) and (ii) above should apply also mutatis mutandis to the additional Indian battalion.* Some notes of this discussion are available in the Secretariat of the Committee of Imperial Defence.
(Iv.) That the Foreign Office should telegraph to the Ambassador at Constanti-nople to the effect that the Ambassador&apos;s view in regard to the reports of mine-laying and measures of fortification by the Turks in the demilitarised zone of the Straits is urgently desired, (v.) That the report of Lord Balfour&apos;s Committee on &quot;Action by the League of Nations in the event of Turkish Aggression &apos;&apos; should be Held in suspense pending (a.) A reply to the telegram mentioned in (iv) above; and(p.) The development of negotiations with the Turkish Government.(vi.) To take note of the Report of the Advisory Committee on Trading and Blockade on &quot;Possible Action by the League of Nations to bring Economic Pressure to bear upon Turkey.&quot;* .&apos; - * . * - * * * *
