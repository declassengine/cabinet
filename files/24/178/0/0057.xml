Markets and Fairs (Welshing of Cattle) Bill. Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries.This Bill is intended to give effect to a recommendation by the Linlithgow Committee on the Distribution and Prices ofAgricultural Produce  (Cmd. 1927 para. 53) as follows:-&quot;If   the proposal is sufficiently supported, &quot;we recommend that legislation should be introduced &quot;rendering it compulsory to weigh all fat stock &quot;before sale, the weights to be exhibited automatically &quot;or otherwise in the sale ring, or in cases where the &quot;market is dependent on a Weighbridge in another part &quot;of the town announced by the Auctioneer from a &quot;certificate furnished by the Weighbridge operator&quot;.From enquiries which have been made by the Ministry of Agriculture, there appears to be considerable support for the compulsory weighing of fat cattle before sale, but the preponderance of opinion seems to be against the compulsory weighing of fat sheep, or pigs, or of store stock.The Introduction of legislation for the:  compulsory weighing of fat cattle has been considered by the National Farmers&apos; Union and the Council of Agriculture, and both bodies have expressed themselves in its favour.The present Bill prohibits Auctioneers  from offering for sale in markets where a Weighbridge is provided, any fat cattle (described in the Bill a3 &quot;cattle fit for immediate slaughter&quot;) unless they have been weighed and the weight disclosed to intending purchasers.Provision is made in the Pill for the Minister to grant exemption in cases where he may consider it expedient to do so.1.
Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 10th February, 1926.The Bill involves a change in practice at certain markets in the country but not at others, as out of about 620 markets which would he affected, all fat cattle are already weighed at 215 of them, rliile weighing is practised to a greater or less extent in a number of   otherscThe Bill does not apply to Scotland a3 the practice of weighing fat cattle at auction marts before sale isasalmost universal and the proposed Bill i.vould therefore be of little or no practical value in that co\.intryaThe Bill may be opposed by representatives of Auctioneers and possibly by some market  authorities as unnecessary on the ground that there is no local demand for the weighing of cattle and that farmers do not make use of the existing facilitiesi    This may be true, but the purpose of the Bill is to encourage the adoption of a practice which has been recognised for many years as advantageous to farmers..1 hope that the Home Affairs Gommittee will recommend the early introduction of this Bill in the House of Lords.vV, G,
