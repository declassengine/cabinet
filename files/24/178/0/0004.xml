[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1926.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 4 (26).CABINET.SEVERN BARRAGE.Extract from Minutes of Sixteenth Meeting of Committee of Civil Research, held at 10, Downing Street, S.W, 1, on&apos;Thursday, December 17, 1925, at 11&quot;30 a.m.* * * * * *7. SEVERN BARRAGE SUB-COMMITTEE.The Committee had before them the first interim Report of the Severn Barrage Sub-Commiitee (O.H. (H) 45).At the request of the -Prime Minister, Colonel Moore-Brabazon summarised the conclusions reached by the Sub-Committee. In considering this question, he had endeavoured to secure an early Report by the Sub-Committee in view of the length of time covered by the previous enquiries. He did not believe that it was possible to decide the main question, whether it was economically desirable to build a Severn Barrage, until it was definitely known whether such a scheme was physically practicable. The scheme was, however, one which appealed to the imagination, and be thought that there was sufficient evidence to justify the first stage of the enquiry being carried out. This would involve a net expenditure of  5,075, which would cover the cost of the aerial survey, the construction of the model of the Severn estuary, the purchase of special tide gauges for use by the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty and the out-of-pocket expenses of and fee for a Civil Engineer. In addition, there remained the marine survey to be undertaken by the Admiralty, the total cost of which would amount to  23,400, but this would constitute no net increased charge on public funds, as the normal activities of the Hydrographic Department were to be proportionately curtailed.Mr. Churchill said that he agreed that a case had been made out for the first stage of the enquiry being undertaken, and he did not propose therefore to offer any objection to the expenditure recommended by the Sub-Committee.Sir P. Gunliff e-Lister suggested that as the Sub-Committee recommended that the Ministry of Transport should be the Department on whose vote the expense involved should be charged, it would be more convenient if Parliamentary questions in regard to this scheme were answered in future by that Ministry rather than by the Board of Trade as heretofore.The Prime Minister concurred in this suggestion.The Committee approved generally the Report of  the Severn Barrage Sub-Committee (C.R. (H.) 45), and agreed : (a.) That a primd facie case had been established for the further expenditure ofpublic money on the prosecution of the enquiry. (b.) That the Ministry of Transport should be the Department on whose vote theexpenses involved in the first stage of the enquiry should be charged, (c.) That tlje following provision should be made for the cost of the first part ofthe investigation : (1.) An Appropriation-in-Aid of Navy Votes in recoupment of the cost of marine survey by the Hydrographic Department. (The total estimated cost is  23,400, exclusive of the cost of the tide gauges referred to in (2) below, and on the same basis the sum required for 1926-27 is  15,400.)[13979] [14046]
(2.) Purchase of tide gauges for use by the Hydrograpbic Department for the purposes of the marine survey,  000.(3.) Survey of the English Stones by aerial photography,  950.(4.) Construction of a model and its . experimental working for one year,  3,000.(5.) Out-of-pocket expenses, and possible fee for civil engineer engaged to visit the proposed site of the barrage, 500 guineas ( 525).(d.) That in future, questions in the House of Commons in regard to the Severn Barrage Scheme should be answered by the Minister of Transport.* * *     . * * *% Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, December 17, 1925.
