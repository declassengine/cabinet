THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS britannic.MAJESTY&apos;S government cabinet.SECRET.CPt 65 (26)HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.0MERCHANDISE MARKS (IMPORTED GOODS) BILL,Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade. &quot; ; **I append, for the consideration of the Home Affairs Committee, a Bill dealing with the marking of imported goods which has been prepared by Parliamentary Counsel in accordance with the views of an Inter-Departmental committee, on which the Board of Trade,  the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Dominions Office,  the Colonial Offioe, the Home Office and the Scottish Office were represented.     The Bill replaoes last year&apos;s Merchandise Marks (Imported Agricultural produce) Bill, and makes provision also for dealing with other goods.     It represents, in fact, a combination of three proposals -(1)    provisions for the marking of imported agriculturalMarks (Imported Agricultural Produoe) Bill)j (2)    provisions for the marking of other goods, onthe lines of a draft Bill which was prepared in 1923,after consultation with industrial and commercial Interests,  for the purpose of giving effect to a substantial measure of agreement which had then been reached.    Thi.s draft Bill was in fact published with departmental concurrence by the Association ofBritish Chambers of Commerce early in 1924;(3)    provisions for distinguishing foodstuffs and goods of Empire origin upon which the Imperial Economic Committee has reported. To these provisions there has been added(4)    a provision (Clause 1) making it illegal to sell or expose for sale or distribute by way of advertisement in the United Kingdom any goods which bear any name or trade mark being,  orproduce (to take the place of last year&apos;b Merchandise
purporting to &quot;be the name or trade mark of any manufacturer, dealer or trader in the United Kingdom not being goods produced or wholly or mainly manufactured therein unless the name or trade mark is accompanied by a definite indication of origin.Broadly as regards goods other than agricultural produce the Bill follows the lines of the draft compromise of 1923. After an inquiry held by a properly constituted standing Committee under the Bill, an Order in Council may be made requiring imported goods of a particular class or description to bear an indication of origin when sold or exposed for sale in the United Kingdom,   In order to safeguard the entrepot trade,  it is provided that the marking shall be at the time of retail sale,  there being In Clauses 3 and 8 provisions whioh take wholesale sale out of the Bill, with the exception noted below.     It must be said at once that a provision which requires marking at the time of sale only and not at the time of importation will not satisfy a number of important industries, e.g, the Sheffield cutlery industry,  the pottery trade, and   the glass bottle industry. But, in 1923 the Federation of British Industries were disposed to accept this compromise in view of the strong opposition that would have arisen from the merchant interests to oompulsory marking on importation.As regards agricultural produce,  however,  it was represented that unless such produce could in oertain oases be marked at the time of importation,  the measure-would be difficult if not Impossible, to work,  in view of
the impossibility of identifying imported goods at the time of sale.    The Bill accordingly provides that in the case of foodstuffs, the Standing Committee may recommend that the mark should be applied at the time of importation or at the- time; of exposure for sale . wholesale,  and that the Order in Council may so provide. The draft provides that the possibility of marking at the time of importation shall apply not only to agricultural produce, but generally to foodstuffs.   This will enable the Canadian representations with regard to the marking of tins of canned salmon to be dealt with; and the re-export trade in goods where this is likely to be claimed is not generally large so that the merchant difficulty is less serious.The obligation imposed by Clause 1,  that goods of any kind bearing any name or trade mark being,  or purporting to be the name or trade mark of any manufacturer, dealer or trader in the United Kingdom must also bear an indication of origin on sale, is no more than a logical extension of the existing Merchandise Marks Act, 1887,  Section 13 of that Act prohibits the importation-of any: goods of foreign manufacture bearing the name or trade mark of any manufacturer, dealer or trader in the United Kingdom, unless such name or trade mark is accompanied by a definite indication of origin. It is anomalous that&apos;this provision should exist at the time of importation and should not apply to goods when sold in this country.^ Many complaints have been received on this subject,  and it is believed that this Clause will be welcomed by the commercial community in this country. This is also a simple and obvious way of ensuring that a purchaser wishing to buy British goods is not misled.
It should.be added that the 3111 lias been drafted with full regard to the recommendations of the Imperial Economic Committee.Attention is also drawn to the following points in the Bill. 1.   Clause 1 has been carefully drafted so as not to apply to goods originally of British manufacture which are re-Imported after having undergone a small manufacturing process abroad^ 2.   The Commit tees, will be two standing Committees, one appointed nase 5..   by the Board of Trade and the other by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary for Scotland acting jointly.    In1the case of the latter Committee the Home Secretary may add a member if and when he thinks it desirable in cases particularly affecting Northern Ireland.This proviso does not affect the Board of Trade; I understand that the Home. Office think it desirable but the Ministry of Agriculture do not.3*   A provision is inserted in the Bill to cover advertisements lag Lj[    of goods of a particular brand or under a specific designation in order to meet representations which have been received from several industries.4,   The definition of indication of origin has been carefully framed so as to prevent the disclosure of the actual country of origin where the trader does not wish it to he disclosed.    It is fse^jS,   proposed that in the case of goods manufactured or produced in a foreign country, the words &quot;foreign manufacture&quot; or &quot;foreign produce&quot; shall be used, and in the case of goods manufactured or produced within the Empire the words &quot;Empire manufacture&quot; or &quot;Empire produce&quot;.    In either case a definite indication of the actual country of origin would be accepted as fulfilling the requirements of the Bill. .5.   Where it is not practically possible to apply an indication ff^jl3,    of origin to goods, the Committee may recommend and the Order may provide that the goods shall be distinguished from similar goods manufactured in the United Kingdom by some form of distinctive
colouring or other difference in their make-up. ? 7 76.    It should be added that Clause 1 has been extended to cover articles bearing British names distributed by way of advertisement.    This will meet a long standing source of complaint.The  special attention of the Home Affairs Committee is directed to the two following points on which t&apos;.:./ir decision is sought:-(1) Orders in Council before they come into force are tobe submitted to Parliament, and actually two alternatives areinserted in Clause 4 -(a).that the Order must be laid beforeParliament in draft and be approved by resolution of both houses, and(b) that the Order must be laid in draft before Parliament and. if either House presents an address against it within twenty-one days, the Order is not to be made.liiihich alternative is considered the better for this purpose?(2) Clause 6 gives to Local Authorities power to execute the provisions of the Bill in so far only as they relate tofoodstuffs, and gives their Officers the right of entry intopremises.    The provision is taken from the Imported Goods(Agricultural Produce) Bill,  and is in the view of the Ministryof Agriculture and Fisheries necessary for the properenforcement of the provisions in so far as they relate tofoodstuffs.    They already occur in a less drastic form in theexisting Sale of Food Order which relates only to meat and eggs.It is probable that the clause will place certain additionalburdens on the Local Authorities and may to some extent increasethe expenditure incurred by them.    It is proposed as will beseen to limit the application of this clause to foodstuffs, butthere will probably be pressure to extend it also to other articles.    It is for the Home Affairs Committee to considerwhether the provision should, in all the circumstances, be sanctioned.(Intd).       P. C -L.BOARD OF TRADE.12th February, 192 6.
Reservation by the Minister of Agriculture,I agree with, the memorandum of the President of the Board of Trade with the exception of the proposal in Clause 3, subsection 5, that the Home Secretary should have power to add a member to the Standing Committee in cases particularly affecting Northern Ireland.    &apos;.i.&apos;Ms appears to run counter to the principle of setting up an impartial Committee and would probably lead to demands for representa-tion from special interests in other parts of the United Kingdom,      Local interests could be dealt with best if put in as evidence before the Standing Committee.    If this Committee is to command &apos;confidence it appears to rae essential that it should be impartial and not representative.(Intd.)   W.G.
