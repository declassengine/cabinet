SUPPLY OF COAST DEFENCE VB SSILS AND SUBMARINE . ajugs- TO RUSSIA.REPORT BY THE NAVAL,  GENERAL AMD AIR STAFFS.1,     We were instructed to consider and report on the question of the proposed supply to Russia by Messrs Vickers of certain war material,  viz: small coast defence vessels and submarine mines.2.     We were informed by the Secretary to the Cabinet that the decision of His Majesty1s Government to prohibit the supply to Soviet Russia of arms and ammunition of British manufacture had been modified in cases where the war material was of a purely defensive character, but that this further question had arisen in particular reference to the possibility of war material supplied to Russia being passed on to Turkey.We beg to report as follows COAST DEFENCE VESSELS.3.      The construction of coast defence vessels in this country for Russia will be advantageous from the standpoint of helping the maintenance of our productive plant-      Such vessels, ,should they fall into the hands of Turkey,   could be easily dealt with by the British Navy.We are therefore in favour of their supply to Russia by this country.NOTEt      In this connection we understand that the 12 coastal motor boats, referred to in a letter from, the Private Secretary to tho. Secretary of State for War dated January 18th,  1926j  which,  we understand., was read to tho Cabinet, are being obtained from Italy.Submarine mikes. -4.     In the event of this country declining to supply Soviet Russia with mines,  they can easily be obtained by Russia from, other countries.
5.     As regards the possibility of mines supplied to Russia being passed on to Turkey,  the latter country could in any case, if so desired, obtain them elsewhere, e.g. from Italy, Turkey has already- had a s 1.1 j-ply of British .mines from Armstrong&apos;3 s ,      They are similar,  as would be any further supply, to the existing reserve of mines for our Navy. They are, however,  inferior to our new design.In the event of the mines being supplied by this coun.tr we should be aware of their type and. potentialities - an advantage in view of the possibility of their use against us GENERAL.6,      Both in the case of coast defence vessels and mines, should their provision be in the hands of this country, we could,  in case of emergency, stop supply.CONCLUSION.7.      For th sons indicated above we are unanimously ofopinion that Messrs Vickers should, be authorised to supply the war material indicated in their letter Y/63.1. of the 21st October,  1925, annexed to CP, 3 (26).(Signed) T.H.
