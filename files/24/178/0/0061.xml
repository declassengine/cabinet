Copy No.    30CP. 60 (26).CABINET.COMMITTEE ON EMPIRE MARKETING.REPORT.I. Composition and Terms of Reference.AT a Meeting held on the 3rd February, 1926 (Cabinet 3 (26), Conclusion 11), the Cabinet had before them the following documents in connection with Empire Marketing: -1. A note by the President of the Board of Trade covering the Report of an inter-Departmental Committee on the main recommendations of theImperial Economic Committee.   (C.P.-446 (25).) 2.

The recommendations by the Standing Committee on Expenditure that, in view of the present financial circumstances, the provision of the  1,000,000 grant for the development of Empire trade should be postponed, on the understanding that this did not modify the unqualified intention of the British Government to carry through that policy. (C.P.-31 (26).)The Cabinet agreed-(a.) That the recommendation of the Cabinet Committee on Expenditure in favour of postponing expenditure on the  1,000,000 grant during the present year should be reserved to a Meeting in the near future &apos;:- (b.) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (in the Chair):The Right Hon. Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G., M.P. The Chancellor of the Exchequer :The Right Hon. W. S. Churchill, C.H., M.P. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs :The Right Hon. L. S. Amery, M.P. The Secretary of State for War :The Right Hon. Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Bart., G.B.E., M P. The President of the Board of Trade :The Right Hon. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, K.B.E., M.C., M.P.

II. Composition of Organisation proposed by the Imperial Economic Committee.On examining the papers submitted to us, it appeared to us that the most important of the questions raised in them was that of the character of the organisation to be created for the administration of the proposed grant from public funds. The Imperial Economic Committee recommends in its first report (Cmd. 2493) that the new organisation should be modelled on such precedents as the Development Commission and the Forestry Commission. This Executive Commission would be an administrative body and would have complete control over the expenditure of the Government grant. If this course were adopted, the Govern-ments responsibility would be limited to handing over to the Commission a fixed sum for them to expend in the way that appeared best to them, in the light of the recommendations of the Imperial Economic Committee. We are unable to advise the adoption of this course in such a case as we are considering. We think that the House of Commons will require a closer parliamentary control and a more direct ministerial responsibility in the administration of so novel a grant, which may well raise questions of great general importance. We hold that whatever form of organisation is adopted, it must be of such a kind that the programme of expenditure can be brought under parliamentary review and that a Minister can be made answerable to Parliament for it.III. Organisation recommended by the Cabinet Committee.It is clear from the extract from the Minutes of the Meeting of the Imperial Economic Committee, held on the 3rd November, 1925 (C.P.-458 (25)) that that Committee attach great importance to their proposals for the establishment by the Government of the Executive Commission proposed in their Report. The Imperial Economic Committee is in a peculiar position. It is not a Committee appointed by the British Government, but a body the members of which are nominated by the various Governments of the Empire. We realise the practical importance of securing the concurrence of the Imperial Economic Committee in the form of organisation to be adopted; and from informal communications between the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and Sir Halford Mackinder, we believe that our recommendations can be made acceptable to the Imperial Economic Committee. In framing these recommendations we have endeavoured to devise a scheme which will give to the new Organisation the widest measure of independence compatible with the maintenance of Ministerial responsibility. We consider that this can best be achieved by the appointment of a Committee under the Chairmanship v of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. With the assistance of this Committee, the Secretary of State would be responsible for the administration of the Government grant, and a separate Estimate for which he would be answerable would be presented to Parliament for this Service.It would clearly not be possible for the Secretary of State to attend every meeting of the Committee. We therefore propose that there should be a Vice-Chairman, who could preside in his absence at meetings of the Committee. Such a Vice-Chairman should be in a position to guide the Committee on questions of policy and see that proposals put forward are not of a kind likely to create Parliamentary difficulty. It would seem desirable that either the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies or the Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should be entrusted with this duty.Unless special steps are taken to secure close co-operation between the Imperial Economic Committee and the Secretary of State&apos;s Committee, there would be risk of serious friction between them. In order to remove this danger, we recommend that the Imperial Economic Committee should be invited to nominate some of its members to serve on the Secretary of State&apos;s Committee. The Dominion Governments have always been anxious to prevent the Imperial Economic Committee from becoming an Executive body, but we do not think that any objection on this account would be raised to our proposals by the Dominions, and we understand that they would be welcomed by the Imperial Economic Committee. In view of the fact that the Secretary of State would accept full Parliamentary responsibility for all the Committee&apos;s decisions, it does not appear necessary closely to define the functions of the Committee. In practice it would no doubt be found that, as in the case of the Oversea Settlement Office, most of the Committee&apos;s proposals made in the presence and with the concurrence of the Secretary of State or his representative would be
approved without modification. If, however, an irreconcilable difference of opinion arose between the Secretary of State and the Committee, or a majority -of the Committee, the opinion of the responsible Minister would necessarily be decisive, since he would refuse to accept as a charge upon the grant expenditure which&quot; he felt unable to justify to Parliament. -The number of members to be nominated to the Secretary of State&apos;s Committee by the Imperial Economic Committee can best be settled by the Secretary of State in consultation with the Chairman of the Imperial Economic Committee, but we consider it desirable to provide for representation of British agriculture on the Secretary of State&apos;s Committee by arranging for the appointment of two members to be nominated by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. We further recommend that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury should be appointed a member of the Committee, so that Treasury requirements and criticisms may be considered before decisions are taken.The work of the Secretary of State&apos;s Committee will fall largely into two clearly defined groups, (a) Publicity and Sales, and (b) Research. We consider that it should have power to appoint such Sub-Committees as it may consider necessary for dealing with these and other questions and to appoint thereto suitable persons from outside its own ranks. We attach the greatest importance to the condition that no work should be carried out directly by the Secretary of Staters Committee or by new organisations where there is an existing Government Department or Institution capable of undertaking it. We believe that the whole of the research work can be done in existing institutions. No new organisation for publicity should be created until the facilities already existing in the Stationery Office have been carefully examined nor unless they are proved to be insufficient. By this means the appoint-ment of additional staff will be reduced to a minimum.As regards accounting arrangements we consider it important that parlia-mentary discussion of the grant should be limited to the Vote for the grant itself. It is particularly desirable to avoid the discussion of the policy of the Secretary of State&apos;s Committee on the Votes of other Departments which undertake special work on behalf of that Committee. There ought not, we think, to be any danger of this arising if proper care is taken when the estimates are framed.IV. Subsidiary Machinery to be Created.The staff of the new Committee should be kept within the narrowest limits compatible with efficiency, and its cost should be a charge upon the grant. It will be necessary to appoint a Civil Servant to act as Secretary to the Secretary of State&apos;s Committee and as Accounting Officer to the Vote for the grant. Details regarding subordinate staff should be settled by agreement between the Dominions Office and the Treasury..V. Representation of British Interests. -The Cabinet have already decided that the interests of home producers must he considered in the administration of the grant. We do not anticipate that any difficulty will be experienced in harmonising the interests of British agriculture with those of Empire agriculture, if the Cabinet adopt our recommendation to appoint two representatives of British agriculture on the Secretary of State&apos;s Committee. They are, however, of the opinion that it would not be practicable to attempt to secure the participation of British industry in the grant.VI. Amount and Character of the Grant.The Imperial Economic Committee recommend strongly in their report that any balance unspent at the end of the financial year should be carried forward to the next year and not automatically surrendered to the Exchequer. It appears to us that the balance of advantage lies in treating the proposed grant as a Grant-in-Aid, and allowing the Committee to retain in its hands any balance which may be held at the end of the year. We believe that more economical, administration will be secured in this way, as it will enable the Secretary of State&apos;s Committee to accumulate a reserve on which to finance important schemes. It will further remove the incentive to embarking on expenditure on less important schemes simply to avoid a surrender at the end of a year.&quot;[14227] &apos; b 2
We therefore recommend That the sum voted should be a Grant-in-Aid, unspent balances at the end of a year not being surrendered to the Exchequer, but that, if experience should show-that an abnormally large balance had accrued, the Government should reconsider the situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer dissents from this recommendation and urges that the normal procedure of surrender should be allowed&apos;to operate in this case, and has asked that his dissent from the recommendation in favour of the Grant-in-Aid system should be recorded. We recommend-That the grant should amount to  500,000 this year, and to  1,000,000 next year.VII. Proposed Amendment of Constitution of Imperial Economic Committee.The constitution of the Imperial Economic Committee does not lie strictly within our purview, but this question was raised in the Memorandum circulated by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (C.P.-481 (25)). The questions considered by the Imperial Economic Committee are of the greatest importance to British agriculture, and we consider that it would be an advantage if a representative who could speak for English and Scottish agriculture could be added to the Imperial Economic Committee. There are now three British members on the Committee, and the present proposal, which would raise the number by one, would only give effect to the original scheme by which this country was to have four representatives on the Committee.VIII. Summary of Recommendations. We recommend that-(a.) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should be the Minister responsible for the expenditure of the Government grant, and that, in this matter, he should act in conjunction with a Committee of which he would be the Chairman.(6.) The Secretary of State should be assisted by a Vice-Chairman, who should be either the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies or the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.(c.) The Secretary of State&apos;s Committee should be composed as follows : (1.) Such number of the members of the Imperial Economic Committee as the Secretary of State may determine in consultation with the Chairman of the Imperial Economic Committee.(2.) Two members representing English and Scottish Agriculture.(3.) The Financial Secretary to the Treasury.(d) A Civil Servant should be appointed Secretary to the Secretary of State&apos;s Committee and Accounting Officer to the Vote, and that the details of subordinate staff, which should be as small as possible, should be settled by agreement between the Dominions Office and the Treasury.(e.) The Secretary of State&apos;s Committee should have power to appoint such SUb-Committees as it may consider necessary for carrying out its work, and to appoint thereto suitable persons from outside its own ranks, provided that wherever there is an existing Government Department engaged on similar work, action should be taken by the Secretary of State&apos;s Committee through that Department.(/.) The cost of staff and of work undertaken at additional expense by Govern-ment Departments and public institutions should be a charge against the Government grant.(g.) Arrangements should be made to avoid the necessity for the presentation of Supplementary Estimates by Departments undertaking work on behalf of the Secretary of State&apos;s Committee.(h.) The interests of British agriculture must be considered in any allocation of the Government grant.(*.) The grant for 1926 should be  500,000, and for 1927  1,000,000.
(j.) It should take the form of a Grant-in-Aid, provided that if experience should show that an abnormally large balance had accrued, the Govern-ment would be allowed to reopen this question.Nvte. The Chancellor of the Exchequer dissents from this recommenda-tion, and presses that the normal procedure of surrender of unspent balances should operate in the case of this grant.(k.) Arrangements should be made by the Secretary of State- for Dominion Affairs with Dominion Governments for the appointment of an additional member to the Imperial Economic Committee to represent English and Scottish Agriculture.Signed on behalf of the Committee, AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN (Chairman).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, February 22,, 1926.o
