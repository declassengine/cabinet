RURAL HOUSIEG AETJ SLUM AREAS. REPORT.INTRODUCTORY. 1.   At their Meeting on the 19th January.    1926,(Cabinet 1 (26) 2) the Cabinet decided that the subjectof slum prevention and rural housing should beconsidered in the first instance by a Cabinet committee composed as follows:&quot;The Lord Privy Seal (in the Chair). The Lord Chancellor, The Chancellor of the Exchequer, The Minister of Health,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. The Secretary for Scotland.The Committee have considered the proposalsprepared by the Minister of Health for dealing withthese questions (R.H.(26) 2.) and submit the following report for the consideration of the Cabinet.RURAL 2,    So far as rural housing is concerned, the proposalsHOUSING:,of the Minister of Health aim at facilities for the re-condi t i oning of existing houses in agricultural districts.      There are,  it is estimated:,   20,000 houses which though sufficiently well built are below the necessary standard.      They could, however, be brought up to a reasonably adequate standard by the expenditure of from  70 to  150 per house.     In many cases the condition is so bad that Closing Orders have been made,  but have not been put into operation because of the absence of alternative accommodation in the neighbourhood.     The following
are the main outlines of the Minister of Health1s proposals which would, he believes,  enable these houses to be placed in an adequate state of repair,  though not brought up to so high a standard as thatof the District Council cottages.(a)    loans to owners for carrying out 01 approved reconditioning work (be,  for structural work necessitates generally on sanitary grounds and not minor repairs.)totalCo)    Grant of a proportion (say 2/Srds)  of the/ cost to be made to owner by local authority.(c) Repayment  to the local authority by the Exchequer of part (say Z/Zx&amp;a or -g-)    of the grant made to the owner.(d) Grant to owner to be conditional on his agreement to limit the rent he will charge for the improved house for a period of (say) 20 years.(e) Administration oi the scheme to be mainly in the hands oi county councils;.The -committee have examined these proposals and are in general agreement that the grant of assistance from public funds would be fully justified where it enabled insanitary cottages that are now closed to be re-opened as  this would pro banto increase the number of cottages available at  rents within the reach of the agricultural population.      They feel, however, that proposals involving the payment oi subsidies direct to the owners oi cottc-ge property would be open to mis-representation by political opponents, especially in the case of cottages the t are in actual occupation at the present time.      In the view of some members of the
Committee,; it would be &apos;preferable -to expand and amplify the existing provision for the building of new cottages in rural arees rather than, to spend public money on re-conditioning existing bouses which though in bad condition are in actual occupation.    Various alternative suggestions were, however,t considered by the Committee with a view to improving the sanitary condition of existing cottages.    Thus,  if the scheme were restricted to insanitary houses in respect of/vhich a Closing Order had been made or could be made, it might be possible to require the owner of such property either to turn over trie cottages in question to a local authority at a. valuation,  or himself to put them in a proper state of repair,  and in the latter event, it might be possible to give such owners facilities for obtaining money as proposed by the Minister of Health or on other favourableIt appeared that there were other difficulties to be solved and in view of the intricacy of this question, the Committee do not feel that in the time at their disposal it is possible for them to make definite recommendations regarding the form in which it might be practicable to give further assistance to rural housing.    They consider, however, that the whole question should be examined with the utmost despatch,  and they accordingly recommend that a Departmental or quasi Ministerial Committee should be appointed forthwith for this purpose.    It should bo possible for such a Committee to complete its enquiry within a few weeks.    When their Report has been received it will be open to the Cabinet to consider whether time ought to be found this Session for the legislation that will be required/
SLUM 3*        The proposals of tho Minister of Health for 0 &quot; AS.dealing with slum areas fall into two categories;  those relating to (a) areas which must he cleared and (h) slums actual or potential which can be brought up to the necessary-standard by reconditioning.    As regards the f ormer class adequate provisions  are contained in existing legislation,, but the  conditions for compensation to owners have proved Inequitable in their operation, and the Ministry of Health proposes to confer with the Treasury with a view to reviewing the basis on which compensation is paid.But as an alternative to the existing power of acquiring for demolition the Minister of Health proposes to extend the powers of Local Authorities to enable them to acquire properties situated in deteriorating areas so that they may be in a position to recondition blocks of property without demolition. It is further proposed that the existing arrangements for Exchequer assistance in respect of slum improvement schemes, under which a contribution from public funds is made to an extent not exceeding one half of the average annual loss in carrying out a re-housing scheme,  should be extended to cover re-conditioning schemes undertaken by Local Authorities.      As a further alternative Power might also be given to Local Authori-ties temporarily to take over and administer properties which could with advantage be re-conditioned, where the.owners themselves were unable to raise the necessary capital^.     The Treasury have not at present been afforded an opportunity of considering the financial aspect of the scheme and it will be necessary for this part of the question to be considered jointly by that Department and the Ministry of Health.-.In particular, It may be necessary, in&apos;order to avoid commitments of an indefinite amount,  to  Insert    revisions in the scheme limiting the amount of-Government assistance  to be given in any one financial year.-
A3 an essential part of his scheme for reoorfdftioning slums, the Minister of Health proposes to take, powers to enable or require Local Authorities to transfer the management cf house property in their hands to a small Commission of members nominated by them under a scheme to be approved by the Minister of Health for such a period as will put them outside the electoral influences to which ordinary members of Local Authorities are subject.The Committee realise that the ownership of large numbers of working-class houses by Municipalities would probably result in difficulties and abuses, especially in the case of low-rented property.Subject to  agreement being reached on the financial    j question the Committee approve the proposals of the Minister of Health as to slums and recommend  to the Cabinet that they should be adopted by the Government.I4.      The Committee are in substantial agreement that some paragraph dealing with the housing question should be inserted in the KingTs Speech cn the Opening of Parliament.    It can hardly be doubted that this question will be raised on the. discussion of the Address, in which  case the Government would be called upon to state its proposals.      This being so,  it appears to the Committee that no advantage would be gained by omitting this subject from the Ming1 s . Speech .      They realise, however, that it might possibly prove a source of embarrassment if pledges of too definite a character were given at this stage.      This is particularly true in the case of rural housing in respect of which they are recommending a preliminary enquiry.      At their, iuest the Minister of Health has undertaken tore oi
consider the hearing of the views of the Committee on the reference in the Xing&apos;s Speech and to prepare a paragraph for consideration by the Cabinet .In the  draft of the statement on Government PolicyIpBMENT OHlj CULTURAL on Agriculture which it is proposed should be issued as a policy-Uhite Paper (CP.25  (26)) the present wording of paragraph16 dealing with the question of rural bousing will require....to be further considered in the light of the discussion at to-morrow^ Cabinet.Siened on behalf of the Committee1SALISBURYChairmancWhitehall Gardens,  S,W.l. 28th  January, l026o
