CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,fTHIS,.DOOIEiBH? IS TBB PRO?BI*PY OP HIS &quot;2HITACHI0 MAJESTY&apos;B GOTjjRtfMEHT) .CABINET. TRAPS FACILITIES, BILL,  1926. JEg gI.a.nAum. ^7, the,J&apos;inanoial Secretary to the Treasury,1.      Trade Facilities.      The purpose of Clause 1 of this Bill is to raise the statutory limit to guarantees given by the Treasury under the Trade facilities Scheme from  70 millions to  75 millions and to extend the period during which guarantee^ may be given from 31st March 1926 to 31st March 1927.It is estimated that by the date the new Bill will have become opsrative the guarantees given will amount to approximately  65 million;    the effect of the Bill is therefore to permit an additional  10 millions of guarantees.2.     Export Credits.      Under the Overseas Trade Acts 1920 to 1924, the Board, of Trade are authorised by Parliament to make arrangements in connection with export trade for giving guarantees to an amount not exceeding  26,000,000;    such guarantees to be given before the 8th day of September,  1926, and. to remain in force not later than the 8th day of September 1930.A Committee, under the Chairmanship of Major J.W. Hills. M.P., is examining the question of Insurance against bad debts in export trade.    It is understood that the Committee has finished talcing evidence but it ,will be some little time before they are in a position to present their report,.    The Committee, have, however, agreed in principle to recommend that the Export Credits scheme should, be prolonged.    They will probably also wish to propose that certain changes should be made in the scheme with a. view to its simplification and to meeting certain defects in the conditions which have been commented on byCOPY HO.   O190
witnesses.    it is hoped that any modifications which may be suggested, can be effected without legislation, but in any case it is impossible to anticipate the Committee a recommendations under this head so far as the present Bill is concerned.    The Committee, whilst agreeing in principle to the extension of the Export Credits scheme, will indicate in the clearest possible way that they only recommend continuance of the scheme as a temporary measure and for a limited period.    They will suggest that it should run for 3 years beyond the present expiry date.It is proposed, therefore, that without increasing the maximum liability of  26,000,000,  the Acts should be amended so that the Board of Trade should be empowered to give guarantees at any time before the 8th day of September,  1929, and that the date up to which guarantees may remain in force should, be extended to the 8th day of September 1933.3.      The Bill will require to be based on a Financial Resolution and I ask for authority to table the necessary Resolution immediately.    Unless an extension is provided for by Statute it will be impossible to give new guarantees under the Trade Facilities Scheme after 31st March next.R. MoN.Treasury Chambers,2nd February,   1926.
