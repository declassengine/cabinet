CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,g^POCulCgT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC. lttJV^Y^OC)J^m^v)..Memorandum &quot;by the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State -for India.In December last we circulated to the Cabinet a Memorandum upon this subject251.     We proposed that a Bill should be prepared to give effect to proposals made jointly by the Government of India, the Secretary ofState cn  the-  c-Kt Chan c that two additional appointments should be made to the Judicial Committee, the persons appointed being specially qualified to hear Indian Appeals, that the salary of each should be  4,000 a year; and that the cost should be met equally by British and Indian revenues.     We also proposed that the draft Bill should not be introduced until resolutions approving these proposals had been passed in the Indian Legislative Assembly^     The Cabinet approved these proposals.Resolutions were accordingly introduced in the Indian Legislative Assembly and were defeated.The Viceroy states that though he disagrees with the action taken by the Assembly, he would not feel justified in disregarding the Vote and treating it as perverse, and that though if the proposal were again brought forward in twelve months1 time it might be carried, he is sceptical on the matter.      It is therefore impossible to proceed with tho proposals in their original form.It is, however, in our judgment, most desirable that steps should be taken to strengthen the Judicial&apos;   X C,P.526f 5) 1.C RET.?. 92(26).CABINET.JUDICIAL COMMITTEE
Committee at the earliest moment possible.   Many years have now elapsed since the question was first raised; and ever since 1919 successive lord Chancellors and Secretaries of State have been in agreement that the Indian side of the Judicial Committee requires reinforcement,  and that the necessary strength could only be obtained if salaries larger than those now paid to the members specially appointed by reason of their Indian experience were available *      The two Indian members of the  Judicial Committee are aged respectively 85 and 77.    The amount available for payment under the present law is  800 per annum,  in all, or  400 each, to which a bonus is added.      If a vacancy were to occiir we doubt whether it would be possible to fill it at the salary at present authorised.      ^Furthermore, during the last few years the number of those qualified to sit in the Judicial Committee has been seriously diminishing.. Of the four ex-lord Chancellors, three are otherwise occupied:  and several other peers who are qualified to sit as having held high judicial office are by ill-health or age disabled from giving as regular assistance as in the past oIt is, In our opinion, urgently necessary that steps should &quot;be taken to remedy this state of affairs, and we propose that as the Indian Assembly have rejected the resolutions, steps should be taken to obtain legislative authority for the payment to two members with special Indian experience of salaries of  2,000 each out of British revenues, and that a Bill for the purpose should be prepared and introduced with the least possible delay.Bo1st March,  1926.2o
