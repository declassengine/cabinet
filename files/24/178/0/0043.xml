CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government).SECRET. Q.P.42(26).CABINET. -^14HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. CORONERS BILL.30Memorandum by the Home Secretary.This is a comprehensive Bill for amending the law with regard to Coroners and is based in the main on the Report of the Coroners Committee of 1910, which reported that the existing law was antiquated and required to be brought into line with modern requirements.     During the Debates in December,  1924,  and December,  1925,  on the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, which continues in force two ^Emergency Acts relating to Coroners&apos;   juries,  I had to promise, as my predecessors had promised, that  the question of juries would be dealt with in a permanent amending Bill.The Bill was introduced at the end of last Session for the purpose of eliciting comments and criticisms from persons and authorities concerned.1 think there will be no opposition to the general principles of the Bill, but it is a measure of some length containing- thirty clauses,  and may involve considerable discussion in Committee on points of detail.      For this reason the Bill should be introduced early in the Session and it might,  I suggest, be introduced in the House of Lords.Attached is a copy of the Bill as introduced last Session.      Some amendments in points of detail are under . consideration but these points do not Involve any substantial question of principle and I should be glad to have authority to introduce the Bill subject   to such minor amendments.as may be required.W.J.H.5th February,  1926.
