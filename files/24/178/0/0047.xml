CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^. -GOVERNMENT,SECRET. C.P.46(26)CABINET,, HOME APPAORS COMMITTEE.?51DRAFT BANKRUPTCY (AMENDMENT) BILL. 1925.       T.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.This Bill is based mainly on the Report of the Bankruptcy Committee, 1924/25, but contains in addition a few amendments of the law designed to meet difficulties which have arisen in the course of administration.The Bankruptcy Committee was appointed by the President of the Board of Trade in June, 1924, &quot;to consider and report what amendments the Bankruptcy Act of 1914 recent, experience has shown to be desirable, more particularly in regard to the provisions for the discovery and punishment of offences.&quot; The Committee was appointed at the urgent request of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, who were alarmed by the large number of fraudulent bankruptcies which occurred on the collapse of the post-war boom.The chief object of the Bill is to strengthen in certain respects the criminal provisions of the Act, and in particular-to make failure to keep reasonable accounts (if followed by bankruptcy) a misdemeanour.   The latter provision has been discussed with the Ministry of Agriculture, in view of the possible difficulty of applying it to farmers.   Having regard to the safeguards the clause contains the Ministry do not object to it.Notes on the various clauses are attached (Annex A), and also a note on such of the recommendations of the Bankruptcy Committee as it is not proposed to adopt.   .Sub-Clause 1(1)  (in part) and Clauses 3 (in part),6,7,8, 9 and 10 of the Bill arise out of recommendations of the Bankruptcy Committee: Sub-clause 1(1)  (in part), Sub-clause 1(2)  aid Clauses 2,3,  (In part), 4,5 and 11. deal with points which have risen in course of administration.Board of Trade,5th February. 1926.P.C .L.
ANNEX A.*52Clause I, Sub-Clause (1).   This sub-clause is designedlepartmental first, to remove the doubts which have been expressed1 proposal.by the Courts whether subsequent good conduct is a &quot;special reason1&apos; for granting a discharge within the meaning of the first proviso to Section 26(2), which provides that the Courts shall refuse the discharge in all cases where the bankrupt has committed any ,   misdemeanour or felony connected with his bankruptcy unless for special reasons the Court otherwise determines.Jommlttee proposal. Secondly, the subrclause proposes that Section 26report, paragraphs139 and 66. of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914, should be amended byabolishing the two years statutory minimum- period of suspension of discharge at present prescribed in certain circumstances and giving the Bankruptcy Court full discretion as to the period of suspension of discharge.The existence of a fixed minimum of suspension   -has caused difficulty in dealing with cases where there has been no moral turpitude, with the result that a practice has arisen in the Courts of evading the difficulty by employing one of the alternative penalties and requiring a bankrupt, as a condition of his discharge, to consent to judgment for a merely nominal sum.Under the Bankruptcy Act of 1883 the Court had full discretion as to the period of suspension and In many cases the period of suspension ordered was merely nominal:    the statutory minimum of two years was inserted in the Act of 1890 to prevent orders suspend-lng discharges for too short periods, where certain offences were proved.    Subsequent experience has, however,  shown that the earlier system is preferable.
departmental Proposal. Sub-clause, (2).  - One of the present grounds for suspension of discharge is that the bankrupt has within three months preceding the date of the Receiving Order incurred unjustifiable expense by bringing a frivolous or vexatious action, 23(3)(h).    The effect of the limitation of three months is to make the sub-section almost nugatory and this amendment is designed to abolish such limitation while at the same time limiting the action in question to one which has brought on or contributed to the bankruptcy, kpartmental Proposal. Clause 2.    This clause is inserted at theI[ommittee Proposal. Paragraphs 41-45. 67 and 68.request of the Commercial Travellers&apos; Association. It is possible that the clause merely states the present law, but the point is one which it is desirable to clear up.Clause 3.    The object of this  amendment is to place all the modes of administration of bankrupts&apos; and insolvents&apos; estates on the same footing, as was intended, but was not completely effected by Section 39 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914.    It is also designed to meet certain difficulties which have arisen in construing the section.    The points in which the clause amends section 39 are:-(i) It makes the section apply where asecond or subsequent Receiving Order is followed by a composition or scheme of arrangement, (ii) It makes the section applicable in the case of a bankruptcy followed by an order for the administration of the estate of a deceased insolvent (Section 130).-o-
Illdepartmental proposal.hepartmental Iroposal.ixnmitteo prorjosal pagraphs 13&quot; &amp; 56.(lii) It restricts debts provable in the subsequent bankruptcy, composition or administration, by the trustee in the first bankruptcy to the unsatisfied balance of the debts provable against the property of thei bankrupt in the first bankruptcy and thus excludes partnership debts in the first bankruptcy, which a recent judgment in re Moss (1923, B   &amp; G.R.  135) had included. Crlause 5.    This amendment is designed to meet tho difficulty which has arisen in such cases as that of re Wigzoll (1921,  2 K.B. 835) where the amount of a debtor&apos;s cheques honoured by his bank after the date of the Receiving Order, without knowledge of a Receiving Order having been made, was hold to bo recoverable by the trustee from the bank.    It is considered equitable that the trustee should in the first place endeavour to recover from the porson who actually receives the money or property.Clause 6. Sub-clause (1).    Certain acts and defaults (e.g. fraudulent removal of property, concealment of property, destruction or mutilation of books) are at present criminal only if committed within six months prior to the presentation of the petition.    Having regard to the long periods of credit given in business and to the fact that the debtor does sometimes, by staving off the presentation of petition, cause the six months period to elapse, it is considered that the period of six months is too short and should be extended to twelve months.
paragraphs 30 &amp; 62.paragraphs 32 &amp; 63.paragraphs 17 &amp; 57.paragraphs 22* 25 &amp; 58.Sub-clause (2).     This amendment is designed to make the punishment for the offences referred to similar to that prescribed by Section 32 of the Larceny Act 1916, which deals with obtaining property under false pretences and fixes a maximum punishment of 5 years penal servitude.Sub-clause (3).     This clause is inserted to make criminally liable the receiver of any property the bankrupt has fraudulently pawned, pledged or disposed of and for which he has not paid..Clause 7*   This amendment is designed to remove the doubt whether a collusive execution suffered or connived at by the bankrupt with intent to defraud&apos; his creditors or any of them comes within the meaning of Section 156 (b).Clause 8.   This clause makes failure to keep and preserve proper books of account a criminal offence in the case of a first bankruptcy, instead of as heretofore only where a bankruptcy has been preceded by a prior bankruptcy or composition or arrangement with creditors.   The clause is designed to meet the great difficulty which has occurred in many fraudulent bankruptcies owing to the absence of books and the consequent inability to investigate the transactions of t&amp;e debtor.     The books of account which are required are further defined so as to enable the origin and destination of the goods to be determined.     In order to meet the case of the smaller retailer and the like, a proviso has been made that failure to keep books shall not be an offence in a first bankruptcy if the unsecured liabilities do   not   exoeed    500   and   the   existing
provisos are retained (a) that a prosecution canonly be instituted by Order of the Court and (b)that a bankrupt shall not be convicted under thissection if he proves that in the circumstances in which he traded or carried on business the omission to keep books was honest and excusable.The Ministry of Agriculture has been consulted with regard to the application of thisclause to farmers and in view of the safeguards which it contains they see no objection to it.It does not come into operation untiltwo years after the commencement of the Act.pmittee proposal Clause 9.    The section of the Bankruptcyiragraphs 29 &amp; 60.Act which it Is proposed to repeal, empowering the Bankruptcy Court to commit for trial anyperson whom the Court has ground to believe tohave committed a statutory misdemeanour incases of bankruptcy, is one that does notappear ever to have been used, and is of doubtful advantage.Ittee proposal Clause. 10.

as to render a prosecution desirable&quot;.   At present if an Official Receiver reports an offence the Court must order a prosecution if satisfied that there is a reasonable probability that the debtor will be convicted- if however, a trustee or other representative of the creditors reports the Court has complete discretion.     The effect of the proposed amend-ment would be to give the Court discretion in all cases.    The existing provision has worked quite satisfactorily and it is not considered desirable to repeal it.(2) The Bankruptcy Committee recommended that the law should be so altered as to provide that the Court shall pronounce on the discharge of every bankrupt on a date not later than two years after ,his Public Examination.    Somewhat similar suggestions as to the automatic consideration of the question of discharge in every bankruptcy were also made by the Bankruptcy Committee of 1S08.    It is, however, thought that the benefit to the commercial community to be derived therefrom is, at any rate in the present financial circumstances,  too doubtful to justify the extra work and consequent expense which would be involved.    The danger arising from the fact that so many bankrupts do not apply for their discharge is sometimes exaggerated.    It should be remembered that, until he has obtained his discharge, a bankrupt is prohibited under a penalty from obtaining credit for more than  10 without disclosing his status.

BANKRUPTCY COMMITTEE, 1924-5. REPORT.To the Eight Hon.Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, K.B.E., M.C., M.P., President of the Board of Trade.Sir,1. By Minute of the Board of Trade, dated the 18th June, 1924, we were appointed as a Committee &quot; to consider and report what amendments of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914, recent experi-ence has shown to be desirable, more particularly in regard to the provisions for the discovery and punishment of offences,&quot; and we have,&apos; accordingly, considered the matters so referred to us.2. The Terms of Reference directed our attention more par-ticularly to the matters dealt with in Part VII (Bankruptcy Offences) of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914, but we have also taken evidence and considered complaints and suggestions regarding the other parts of the Act.3. We have held 15 sittings and have taken the evidence of 17 witnesses, including representatives of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, the Textile Trades&apos; Association for the Prevention of Fraudulent Trading, the British Wholesale Mantle and Costume Manufacturers&apos; Association, the National Association of Trade Protection Societies, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, the Provision Trade Section of the London Chamber of Commerce, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors, and the British Bankers&apos; Association. The wholesale jewellery .trade and the boot and shoe manufacturing industry were invited to send witnesses, but informed the Committee that they had nothing 10 add to the evidence which they understood had already been given by some of the witnesses mentioned above. In addition, the Committee invited the expert assistance of the following gentlemen, who were good enough to attend as witnesses, Mr. Frank Mellor, one of the Bankruptcy Registrars of the High Court; Mr. Walter Durrance, Official Receiver at Bradford; Sir Archibald.Henry Bodkin, Director of Public Prosecutions; the Hon. W. J. H. Boyle,. Senior Official Receiver at the High Court; Mr. J. R. J. Johnston, Chief Bankruptcy Clerk, Board of Trade; and Mr H. E. G. Burls, Assistant Solicitor to the Board of Trade. The Committee h ave also received and con-sidered a number of valuable memoranda and suggestions from bodies representing various branches of trade or industry, arad also from individuals. :- &apos;61864 A 2
4. During our enquiry Mr. A. M. Samuel, M.P., has been appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade (Over-seas Trade Department) and has, consequently, ceased to be a member of the Committee, and Mr. H. H. Spencer has been unable, on account of ill-health, to attend the later meetings. The unavoidable absence of these two gentlemen has deprived the Committee of much valuable assistance.5. The evidence and documents placed before us and the fact that the interest shown in our enquiry by the commercial com-munity related almost exclusively to the means to be adopted to deal with, and as far as possible prevent, particular types of fraudulent bankruptcy, have led us to the conclusion that, in the main, the Bankruptcy Act, 1914, and the procedure there-under have proved satisfactory. We have, however, received suggestions for reform of the law relating to a number of Sections of the Act, and we propose, in the following Report, to deal first with the various suggestions relating to the provisions for the discovery and punishment of offences, as being the matters with which we are more particularly concerned, and when to deal with the other parts of the Act which do not relate to criminal responsibility. At the end of our Report we state, in summary form, our general recommendations as to amendment of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914.6. Before, however, dealing specifically with these matters, we beg to report that the evidence has satisfied us that in various branches of industry, particularly in the textile trades, very heavy losses have been sustained since the War by fraudulent trading, carried on largely by aliens, especially in the City and the East End of London. By starting business on a small scale .and at first paying for the goods supplied, these persons have enabled themselves to gain credit and increase their orders. Having obtained credit terms in this way, large orders are given by them spread over a wide area, and before the time for payment arises, the buyers have either disappeared or become bankrupt, and in either case the goods have disappeared. The disposal of the goods is accounted for in the books, if any are kept, as &quot;cash sales &quot; or as book debts owing by persons who are either fictitious, or cannot be found. In the absence of any proper description in the books, the tracing of the goods and of the proceeds of sale becomes very difficult and sometimes impossible. These bankrupts trust to the difficulties of obtaining the necessary evidence for a conviction and to getting a light sentence if they are convicted. It should be observed that many of those who have suffered losses have given credit to a surprising extent 10 these aliens without adequate enquiries as to their financial posi-fion, and without even taking up the references where any are given. An instance was given us by one witness where ordinary caution would have shown, as was found in the subsequent bank-ruptcy of the buyer, that the references. were given by men of straw; the one for the other as occasion served.  Another instance
was of credit to the extent of  4,500 being given to a minor, who had no business premises and was living at his mother&apos;s house. But the evidence shows that much of the credit given was the result of the severe fall in prices in 1920-1, and of the desire to get rid of accumulated stock, which led traders to grant credit to persons to whom it would not have been given under normal conditions.The Discovery of Bankruptcy Offences.7. The present system of investigation of the conduct of a bankrupt comprises a searching preliminary examination of the debtor in private by the Official Receiver of the Court, or his Officers, followed by a public examination of the debtor before the Bankruptcy Court; in addition, the Official Receiver and Creditors&apos; Trustee (if one is appointed) are able to have the debtor himself and other persons examined on oath at sittings before the Registrar or Judge of the Court held in private, and to obtain orders compelling the production of books and docu-ments and the filing of cash and goods accounts relating to the debtor&apos;s conduct and affairs. The debtor himself is also under statutory obligation, disobedience to which is punishable as contempt of Court, to attend upon the Official Receiver or the Trustee, or at meetings of the creditors, at which he can be required to give information and make complete disclosure a&quot;s to his affairs.8. We have received no complaints as to the existing system of investigation of conduct. On the contrary, the Director of Public Prosecutions spoke in the highest terms of the work of the Official&apos;Receivers and their staffs in preparing reports and conducting examinations, and of the assistance they afforded him in the cases which came before him. It was suggested by one witness that there should be, under Section 25, power to examine any banking account in the name of any member of the bankrupts family without proving, as a preliminary, that there is reason to think that the proceeds of the bankrupts assets had gone into that account; but this suggestion seems to the Committee to exceed all reasonable limits. It was the view of nearly all the witnesses that the possibilities of discovering and proving fraud in the type of fraudulent bankruptcy which has lately been occurring in the textile trades, and is referred to in paragraph 6, would be greatly increased if proper books of account were kept, but this matter is dealt with in the next section of our Report in connection with the suggestions relating to the provisions of Section 158 of the Act.9. We, therefore, report with regard to the provisions of the Act relating to the discovery of offences that no amendment is required.The Punishment of Offences. 10. During the last session of Parliament a Bankruptcy Bill (hereinafter referred to as the 1924 Bill), was introduced into the51361 A 3
House- of Commons as a Private Member&apos;s Bill and subsequently withdrawn when the President of the Board of Trade announced his decision to appoint this Committee. This 1924 Bill was drafted as the outcome of a report by a Committee appointed by the Executive Council of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, in pursuance of a resolution passed by that body, con-sequent upon the very serious losses caused by fraudulent bankruptcies to various trades, more particularly to the textile trades. The amendments of the Act proposed in this 1924 Bill related almost exclusively to Part VII (Bankruptcy Offences) of the Act, and we have had particular regard to them during our enquiry.11. In the following sections of our report we take the existing sections of Part VII of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914, in order, and ;,deal first with the complaints and suggestions that we have received relating thereto, and then with the suggestions relating to other parts of the Act, which refer to non-criminal matters.Bankruptcy Act, Part VII (Bankruptcy Offences) .12. Section. 154. Many of the acts and defaults dealt with in this section are criminal only if committed within six months prior to the presentation of the petition. It was proposed in the 1924 Bill to increase this period to twelve months, and the witnesses who appeared before us were almost unanimously in favour of this change. It was stated that many acts are committed which would be crimes if committed within six months of the petition, but that by staving off presentation of the.petition, by persuasion of creditors, or by other means, debtors evade the consequences of their acts. It was also stated that, having regard to the longer periods of credit now given, especially in the seasonal trades, the period of six months had become too short. Such little evidence as was opposed to this proposal was principally by way of expressing doubt whether the disadvantages of the further period of investigation required would be outweighed by the amount of crime prevented or punished by the change. The period of four months in the Debtors Act, 1869, was extended to six months only as recently as the Act of 1913, but the case for the further extension of this period to twelve months appears to us to be established.13. We recommend that sub-sections (4), (5), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), of Section 154 should be amended so as to provide that the acts and defaults of a debtor, which by those sub-sections are made criminal offences if done or committed within six months before the presentation of a bankruptcy petition, by or against him, on which a Receiving Order is made, shall be made criminal offences if done or committed within twelve months before the presentation of such a petition.14. No other amendment of the existing sub-sections of Section 154 has been suggested to us, but there have been several
additions to this section proposed. The 1924 Bill proposed to add the following sub-clauses : (a) If, within twelve months next before the present at;on of a bankruptcy petition, he has contracted any debt provable in the bankruptcy without having at the time of contracting it any reasonable or probable ground or expectation (proof whereof shall lie on him) of being ..   able to pay it ;(b) If, within twelve months next before the presentation of a bankruptcy petition, he has incurred liabilities with a view to increasing his assets in the bankruptcy;(c) If, knowing his insolvency, he shall have permitted orsuffered the whole or substantially the whole of his assets to be seized by, or applied for the benefit, of a particular creditor or creditors to the detriment of the general body of his creditors ;(d) If, within twelve months next before the presentation ofa bankruptcy petition, he, knowing his insolvency, shall have purchased goods and sold the same goods at less than cost or current market&apos; price unless he shall satisfy the court that such conduct was not fraudulent;(e) If, within- two years next before the presentation of abankruptcy petition, any payment shall have been made by a bankrupt to any person whether it be his wife, a relative, or otherwise, not in connection with a business transaction nor for valuable consideration, and at a time when the bankrupt knew he was insolvent or would become insolvent as a result of such payment.15. As regards (a), the greater part of the evidence before us has been to the effect that to,make criminal this act, which at present is one of the grounds for refusal of an unconditional dis-charge, would be much too drastic. It has been pointed out that if the debtor has contracted any debt provable in the bankruptcy, he would be prima facie guilty, and then the onus would be on him to prove that at that time he had reasonable expectation of being able to pay it. Apart from the general principle that it is undesirable to multiply crimes, unless there is some grave evil to be remedied not reached by the existing law, we are of opinion that no case has been made out for this proposal, and it does not in itself appear to us desirable. We therefore do* not recommend this addition to the present section.16. As regards (b), this is similar to one of the present grounds for refusal of an unconditional, discharge (see Bankruptcy Act, 1914, Section 26 (3)&apos;). We are informed that it is over 10 years since this particular fact has been reported on any application for discharge, and not more than seven instances have occurred since the Act of 1890.   The evidence thus shows that this offence is
additions to this section proposed. The 1924 Bill proposed to add the following sub-clauses : (a) If, within twelve months next before the presentation of a bankruptcy petition, he has contracted any debt provable in the bankruptcy without having at the time of contracting it any reasonable or probable ground or expectation (proof whereof shall lie on him) of being able to pay it ;(b) If, within twelve months next before the presentation of a bankruptcy petition, he has incurred liabilities with a view to increasing his assets in the bankruptcy;(c) If, knowing his insolvency, he shall have permitted orsuffered the whole or substantially the whole of his assets to be seized by, or applied for the benefit, of a particular creditor or creditors to the detriment of the general body of his creditors;(d) If, within twelve months next before the presentation ofa bankruptcy petition, he, knowing his insolvency, shall have purchased goods and sold the same goods at less than cost or current market&apos; price unless ho shall satisfy the court that such conduct was not fraudulent;.(e) If, within two years next before the presentation of abankruptcy petition, any payment shall have been made by a bankrupt to any person whether it be his wife, a relative, or otherwise, not in connection with a business transaction nor for valuable consideration, and at a time when the bankrupt knew he was insolvent or would become insolvent as a result of such payment.15. As regards (a); the greater part of the evidence before us has been to the effect that to,make criminal this act, which at present is one of the grounds for refusal of an unconditional dis-charge, would be much too drastic. It has been pointed out that if the debtor has contracted any debt provable in the bankruptcy, he would be prima facie guilty, and then the onus would be on him to prove that at that time he had reasonable expectation of being able to pay it. Apart from the general principle that it is undesirable to multiply crimes, unless there is some grave evil to be remedied not reached by the existing law, we are of opinion that no case has been made out for this proposal, and it does not in itself appear to us desirable. We therefore do&apos; not recommend this addition to the present section.16. As regards (b), this is similar to one of the present grounds for refusal of an unconditional, discharge (see Bankruptcy Act, 1914, Section 26 (3)). We are informed that it is over 10 years since this particular fact has been reported on any application for discharge, and not more than seven instances have occurred since the Act of 1890.   The evidence thus shows that this offence is
very rare, and, moreover, we think it would be difficult of proof, and that if it occurred it could be sufficiently dealt with under Section 154 (14).   We are unable to accept this proposal.17. As regards (c), the general view of the witnesses was that this is much too drastic, but many witnesses desired to have a similar provision limited, however, in its application to collusive action with intent to defraud other creditors. We think that the latter proposal is worthy of consideration -and- we suggest that either by a new sub-section of Section 154, or by amendment of Section 156, sub-section (b) (if not already sufficiently wide) a collusive execution suffered or permitted by the bankrupt should subject him to liability to criminal proceedings.18. As regards (d) and (e), the weight of evidence before us leads to the conclusion that those offences are already sufficiently met by Section 154, sub-section (15) and Section 156, sub-section (b) respectively, and this opinion was expressed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. In this view we concur and we are unable to accept either of these proposals.19. Section 155. No complaint or suggestion of any imporfc-ance has been made to us as to this section. There is evidence that a certain amount of trouble is still caused by undischarged bankrupts trading, nominally as managers, in the names of relatives. This is a difficult matter to deal with satisfactorily under Section 155 (b), and the evidence before us suggests that traders would do well to avail themselves more freely of the Registration of Business Names Act, 1916, and report to the Board of Trade any case of non-compliance therewith. We are assured that the Board have taken and will take all steps to enforce compliance with that Act, where complaint or information reaches them that its requirements have not been fulfilled. We do not suggest any amendment of Section 155.20. Section 156.-The evidence before us does not suggest any alteration of this section and we make no recommendation relating thereto, except so far as suggested in paragraph 17 above.21. Section 157. We have had no evidence which leads us to think that any alteration in this section is necessary..22. Section 158.-- The proposals of the 1924 Bill with regard to this section were as follows : (1) Section one hundred and fifty-eight of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914, shall have effect as if the words &quot; on any &quot;previous occasion&quot; in sub-section (1) of that section had been omitted therefrom. (2) The following sub-section shall be substituted for sub-section (3) of Section one hundred and fifty-eight of &apos;      the Bankruptcy Act, 1914 :  &quot; (3). For the purposes of this section, a person shall be deemed not to have kept proper books of account if he has not kept such books or accounts as are necessary to exhibit or explain
his transactions and financial position in his trade, business on profession, including a &apos; book or books containing entries from day to day in sufficient detail of all cash received and cash paid and, where the trade or busi-ness has involved dealings in goods, also accounts of all goods sold including a descrip-tion in sufficient detail of all goods sold and purchased whether for cash or credit, as will enable such goods to be identifiable and also particulars of the name and address of the supplier or purchaser of such goods, and statements of annual stocktakings showing the basis upon which such stocktakings are made : Provided that .a person engaged in any retail trade in which it would be a hardship or against the usual custom of the trade to enter such details as are hereinbefore required, then and in such cases, the omission-sion shall be deemed to be excusable.&quot;23. As regards the proposed sub-clause (1), the words in Section 158 sub-section (1) of the Act which it would be neces-sary to omit are &quot; who has on any previous occasion been adjudged bankrupt or made a composition or arrangement with his creditors.&quot; All the witnesses, except one, concurred in this proposal to make it criminal in a first bankruptcy not to have kept and preserved proper books of account. It was generally recognised by the witnesses that there would have to be a period of two years or so after the passing of such a law before any prosecution should take place and it was suggested that the sub-clause should apply only to cases where the unsecured liabilities were of substantial amount. The view was expressed that the proposed sub-clause would be of considerable value as a comple-ment to Section 157 sub-section (1) (c).   In this view we concur.24. As regards the proposed sub-clause (2) the witnesses generally urged that some further definition of the books to be kept is required in addition to that contained in the present Section 158 sub-section (3), particularly with a view to enabling goods sold or otherwise got rid of to be traced to their ultimate destination. The evils aimed at, so far as the evidence before us goes, occur in the course of carrying on trade or business, and we have heard nothing to induce us to think that the section should be extended to professions.25. We recommend that Section 158 should be-amended so as to make failure to keep and preserve proper books of account criminal in the case of a first bankruptcy, subject to the following conditions :  (a) The present proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 158 of the Act of 1914, with the substitution of five hundred pounds for one hundred pounds, should be retained as
-a protection. We think this would be quite sufficient f. . ... to exempt the honest retailer selling goods in the , ordinary course of his business.&apos; (b) The law should further define the books to be kept so -i that they shall include accounts of all goods sold and., bought and sufficient details of such goods and ofthe buyers and sellers thereof respectively to enable the goods and the buyers and sellers thereof to be j.&apos; identifiable.(c) No prosecution for this offence should take place before two years after the passing of the Act.We would refer to the recommendations made in paragraph 48 of the Report of the Bankruptcy Law Amendment Committee of 1908 (Cmd. 4068).. 26. Sections 159 and 160. No complaint or suggestion has been made regarding either of these&quot; sections and we make no recommendation. ..27. Section 161. Under this section, as it stands at present, where an Official Receiver or a Trustee in bankruptcy reports to the Court that in his opinion a debtor has been guilty of a bank-ruptcy offence, or where the Court is satisfied upon the representa-tionuf any creditor or member of the Committee of Inspection that there is ground to believe that the debtor has been guilty of any such offence, &quot; the Court shall, if it appears to the Court that there is a reasonable probability that the debtor will be convicted, order that the debtor be prosecuted for such offence. Provided that it shall not be obligatory on the Court in the absence of any application by the Official Receiver for such an order to make an order under this section for the prosecution of an offence, unless it appears to the Court that the circumstances are such as to render a prosecution desirable.&quot;The 1924 Bill proposed that the proviso in Section 161 should be omitted. Almost all the witnesses considered that trustees and official receivers should be on equal terms in applying for an order to prosecute, and many witnesses thought that it should hot be necessary in&apos;the case of an application for an order by a trustee, for the Court to be satisfied that, as well as there being a reasonable probability of conviction, a prosecution was in the circumstances desirable. On the other hand, it has been pointed out that the repeal of the proviso would limit the discretion of the Court and lead to orders for prosecution being made where a merely technical offence had been committed, and where, even if a conviction was probable, a nominal sentence only was to be expected. An alternative suggestion has been made to put trustees and official receivers on the same terms in these matters by omitting from the proviso the words &quot; in the absence of any application by an Official Receiver for such an order.&quot; This would give the Court full discretion. We recommend that in Section 161. after the words &quot; If it appears to the Court that
tbera is . a reasonable probability that the debtor will be convicted &quot; there should be inserted the words &quot; and.that the circumstances are such as to render a prosecution desirable-&apos;&apos;; and that the proviso should be repealed.28. Section 162. No suggestions were made regarding this section and we make no recommendation.29. Section 163.-&quot;This section gives the Bankruptcy Court power to- commit for trial. It was generally agreed by the witnesses who dealt with the matter that this section has never been used and might well be repealed. The Director of Public Prosecutions, with a view to avoiding some of the delay which occurs before a prosecution takes place, suggested that this section might be replaced by a section giving power to the Court of Bankruptcy, upon the disclosure in the Public Examination of the debtor of an offence, to direct him to be apprehended and taken there and then to a Police Court and charged. In order to give the Magistrates jurisdiction, it was said that it should be provided that the order for the bankrupt&apos;s apprehension should be deemed to be equivalent to an information, and an order to prosecute under Section 161 of the Act. The evidence, how-ever, of Mr. Registrar Mellor, speaking on behalf of the Bankruptcy Registrars of the High Court, was opposed to the Court of Bankruptcy being given any such powers, and we are not satisfied that it would work well in practice. We do not, therefore, recommend anything except a total repeal of the section.30. Section  164. This  section  deals  with  the  trial  and punishment of offences.   The provision in the Bankruptcy and Deeds of Arrangement Act, 1913, embodied in this section, making all bankruptcy offences punishable on summary convic-tion, has proved very satisfactory in practice.   It has, however, been the opinion of all the witnesses who gave evidence, on this point that there has been a tendency to treat bankruptcy offences as being of a less serious character than they in truth are, and that the present limitations. of the power of the Court in. regard to punishment have conduced to this view.   We are satisfied that, in recent years particularly, the frauds committed by bankrupts have resulted in very serious loss to creditors and have in many cases been carried on systematically and to an increasing extent. We, therefore, think that further power should be given to the Court.   It has been suggested that Courts of Summary Jurisdie-tion should be given power to inflict up to 12 months&apos; imprison-ment for a bankruptcy offence instead of only six months as at present.     It has also been suggested that as regards sub-sec- : tions 154 (13), (14) and (15) the punishment should be similar to that prescribed by Section 32, of the Larceny Act, 1916, which section deals with obtaining property by false pretences, and fixes a maximum punishment of five years&apos; penai servitude. The Common Sergeant (Sir Henry Dickens, K.C.), in a recent
trial of a fraudulent bankrupt, stated that in his opinion fraudulent bankruptcies would not be put down until the Courts were in a position to inflict penal servitude.We concur in both these proposals.31. Sections 165 and 166. No complaints or suggestions regarding these two sections were made and we make - no recommendation.Additional Suggestions eelating to Bankruptcy. Offences.32. It was urged by several witnesses that some provision should he made in the Bankruptcy Act to punish any person who buys new goods at such a price that he must be aware that the seller was not paying for them, and, further, that in such a case, the trustee should be given power to re-open the transaction, and obtain from the buyer the difference between the price he paid for the goods and their real value. We do not think -that this last proposal is practicable. As regards punishment for an offence it was generally agreed that there would be considerable difficulty in proving the case, but the matter was considered to be one of prime importance by many of the witnesses. A conviction for an analogous offence is, we believe, sometimes obtainable at present on a charge of con-spiracy, but it has been suggested, and we concur in the suggestion, that the principle of Section 33 of the Larceny Act, as explained in the case of Kutas (17 Criminal Appeal Reports, 179) should be applied so as to make it an offence to receive property unlawfully obtained contrary to Section 154, sub-sections (13), (14) and (15) and that a provision to this effect should be embodied in the Bankruptcy Act.33. The Director of Public Prosecutions has informed us that one of the great difficulties he has to contend with in connexion with bankruptcy offences would be removed by amending the Bankruptcy Act as regards venue, and inserting in that Act a provision similar to that in Section 39* (1) of the Larceny Acr, 1916, which provides that &quot; a person charged with any offence against this Act may be proceeded against, indicted, tried and punished in any country or place in which he was apprehended or is in custody as if the offence had been committed in that country or place : and for all purposes incidental to or con-sequential on the prosecution, trial, or punishment of the offence, it shall be deemed to have been committed in that country or place.&quot;34. We recommend that a section on the lines of Section 39 (1) of the Larceny Act, 1916, should be inserted in Part VII of the Bankruptcy Act.,&apos; Bankruptcy Act, 1914, Part I (Proceedings from Act of Bankruptcy to Discharge). 35..The only evidence of importance before us regarding tins part of the Act relates to Section .26 which deals with applica-tions for discharge.
Most of the witnesses desired that the law should be altered so as to provide that on a fixed date after the close of the bankrupt &apos;s public examination the bankrupt should be compelled to come before the Court, and have his conduct considered and the question of his discharge from bankruptcy determined. It is a matter for consideration whether this should be effected by a bankrupt being compelled to apply for his discharge or by the consideration of the discharge by the Court in every case, whether the bankrupt applies or not, but with power to require the bankrupts attendance. The main reasons put forward in support of this suggested change are: (a) Undischarged bankrupts are a danger to the tradingcommunity.(b) That when a man applies for his discharge, frequentlysome years after his bankruptcy, there is difficulty owing to lapse of time in getting full information for the purpose of the report on his conduct.(c) It is very undesirable that a bankrupt should be allowedto think himself free the moment that his public examination is concluded, as so many bankrupts do.(d) Offences under Section 155 appear in many cases to havebeen considered as merely technical offences and the provisions of the Section do not act as any real deterrent.(e) To have the character of a bankruptcy considered and thequestion of the bankrupfs discharge determined would greatly assist Trade Protection Societies and other bodies in giving information to traders as to the posi-tion and standing of persons who ask for credit. (/) That the expense involved by the extra work thrown on Courts, Registrars and Official Receivers would be far outweighed by the advantages obtained.36. On the other hand objection has been raised to the above proposal principally on the grounds that-(a) Discharge is a privilege and should not be thrust uponthe bankrupt.(b) That there may be a tendency if a time is fixed for theconsideration of discharges in all cases for the matter to become one of routine.(c) That undischarged bankrupts are not really a menace tothe trading community.37. Other suggestions on this matter made to the Committee may be summarised as follows : (a) That the Official Receiver should at some fixed period, say six months, after the close of the public examination, place upon the file a report dealing with the conduct of the debtor stating whether any misdemeanour or felony under, the Act has been-committed and reporting the &quot; facts &quot; (if any) which prevent an immediate un-conditional discharge under Section 26, sub-section (3).
It has been suggested that such a report would be useful if the debtor should apply for his discharge at any future time, and would also satisfy the require-ments of Section 73 (a), where a minor offence has been committed, and thus save the. Official Receiver from having to report to the Court an offence, where such an offence will obviously not support an Order for Prosecution.(b) That an undischarged - bankrupt continuing to trade should be compelled to furnish to the Official Receiver periodically, for a certain number of years, a certified balance-sheet.(c) That undischarged bankrupts should annually notify inwriting to the Official Receiver, with a statutory declaration, their addresses, occupations and earnings.38. We are of opinion that in one or the other of the ways mentioned in paragraph 35 the Court should pronounce on the discharge of every bankrupt on a date to be fixed as soon as may be after the granting by the Board of Trade of the Trusteed release (unless the bankrupt has himself already applied for his discharge), but not later than two years after the close of the Public Examination, if the Trustee has not been released by that time. We prefer that the Court should consider the discharge, whether or not the bankrupt himself applies, with power to require his attendance at the hearing. We would refer in this connection to the somewhat similar recommendation contained in the Report of the Bankruptcy Law Amendment Committee of 1908 (Cmd. 4068) (paragraph 85).39. It has been suggested further that the two years statutory minimum period of suspension of a discharge should be done away with, and the Bankruptcy Court be given complete discretion to deal on its merits with every case in which a bankrupt&apos;s discharge is considered. It was stated that the existence of a fixed minimum of suspension (apart from its undesirability on general grounds) has caused- difficulty in dealing with cases where there has been no moral turpitude, with the result that the Courts have been driven to get round the difficulty by requiring the bankrupt, as a condition of his discharge, to consent to judgment for a- merely nominal sum. The objection urged before the Committee to the abolition of this statutory minimum, period of discharge is that the principal reason for establishing it was that when there was discretion to suspend the discharge for, any period that was thought proper, orders suspending discharges for too short periods were made. But we think that this objection should not prevail and we recommend that the minimum period of suspension imposed by Section 26 (2) (ii) should be abolished.Bankruptcy Act, 1914, Part II (Administration of Property) .40, The complaints and suggestions made to us with reference to. this part of the Act relate only to Sections 39, 44, .45, and 46, and we.will deal with them in that order.
41. Section 39 (Subsequent Bankruptcy). We have received a complaint, on behalf of the Provision Trade, as to the right of the trustee in a prior bankruptcy to prove in a subsequent bankruptcy for the unsatisfied balance of the debts in the prior bankruptcy. It was suggested to us that the creditors in the earlier bankruptcy should be excluded until the later creditors had received 20s. in the  , and in support of this proposal, it was stated that, the goods being consumable, the assets in the second bankruptcy would be goods supplied by the later creditors only. This suggestion does not commend itself to us, because the amendment of the law made by the Section was first made so recently as 1913, has not been found in practice to work unjustly, and the reason assigned for its change is put forward only on behalf of a particular branch of trade.42. It has been suggested to us that the words &quot; which is followed by an order of adjudication &quot; should be inserted after &quot; receiving order &quot; in sub-section 39 (1). It is pointed out that a receiving order does not vest anything, and that the learned Judge in the case of Sergeant (1923) 2 Ch. 302 said that, of course, these words must be read into this section. We concur in this suggestion.43. It has been pointed out that in the event of a second or subsequent receiving order being followed by the acceptance and approval of a composition or scheme, the trustee or creditors in the prior bankruptcy have no rights under the section. It was suggested that this was contrary to the intention of the section, and that provision should be made that, in the event of a corn-position or scheme, the trustee in the last preceding bankruptcy should have similar rights as in the case of a subsequent bank-ruptcy.   In this suggestion we concur.44. It was also pointed out to us that where a prior bank-ruptcy is followed by an administration order under Section 130 (administration of a deceased insolvenfs estate), the section as it at present stands does not apply (re Sergeant (1923) 2 Ch. 302). It was suggested that this was not in accordance with the general aim of the section, and that amendment was required to make the section apply in such a case. Such amendment would place all. the modes of administration of bankrupts&apos; or insolvents&apos; estates on the same footing and seems desirable.45. It was suggested that the last part of Section 39 should be amended to show clearly that the trustee in the prior bank-ruptcy is a full creditor, e.g., has a right to vote. We think that this is the result of the section as it stands.46. Section 44 (Fraudulent Preference). At present it is necessary, when taking action under this section, to prove that the dominant motive operating in the mind of the debtor at the time was to prefer a particular creditor. This has given rise to a great deal of litigation in these matters, as it is so difficult to establish motives. It has been suggested that the section should be made to relate to the effect of the act, rather than to the
intention of the debtor, i.e., that any payment, etc., which had the effect of giving any creditor, or surety or guarantor for his debt a preference over other creditors should be set aside as a fraudulent preference. No reason has been suggested which induces us to think that there is any necessity to change the law which has not been materially altered since 1786, as shown by the opinion given in the House of Lords by Lord Halsbury, L.C. in Sharp v. Jackson [1899] A.C. 419, and has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the Legislature. Such a provision as suggested might well have the effect of seriously interfering with the ordinary course of business.47. Sections 45 and 46. Consequent on the judgment in re Wigzell (1921) 2 KB. 835, the witness who appeared before us on behalf of the British Bankers&apos;&apos; Association suggested that the protection afforded by these two sections should be extended to two days after the advertisement of the receiving order has appeared in the G-azette. But we recognise that it would be impossible to restrict this protection to banks and that it would obviously be very dangerous to make it general. We are informed that official receivers already, under the instructions of the Board of Trade, notify banks as early as possible of the making of a receiving order without waiting for the G-azette notice : further, that official receivers are instructed to oppose any stay of advertisement, except on the terms that the bankrupt should submit himself to preliminary examination at once, a condition which the Court has, in recent time at all events, generally thought fit to impose. This enables the official receiver to obtain information about the debtor &apos;s banking account where-upon he notifies the bank concerned. We do not recommend any amendment of Sections 45 and 46.Bankruptcy Act, 1914, Paet III (Official Eeceivers and Staff of the Board of Trade).48. The 1924 Bill proposes the following addition to Section seventy-three of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914 :  &quot; The Official Receiver and/or the Trustee shall in all cases of bankruptcy make and file a special report stating whether or not the bankrupt has, in his opinion, committed any offence under the Bankruptcy Acts, whether by. way of felony or misdemeanour, or of any conduct constituting a ground for attaching conditions to his discharge.&quot; It was, however, generally agreed by the witnesses that the present obligations on the Official Receiver under Section 73 (a) are quite sufficient.   In this connection, our recommendation in paragraph 38 above should be read.Bankruptcy Act, 1914, Paet IV (Trustees in Bankruptcy).49. No complaint or suggestion of importance has been made to us regarding this part of the Act.
Bankruptcy Act, Part V (Constitution, Procedure,      *:W and Powers oe Court).The only suggestion of importance under Part V was made on behalf of the British Bankers&apos; Association and relates to Sec-tion 119. They desired that a receiving order should no longer be made against a firm in the firm name, and that all receiving orders, as is the case now with orders of adjudication should be made against partners in their individual names, and if, after a receiving order is made, it is discovered that there was another partner, then a further receiving order should be made against him, but all bona fide transactions with him, between the first receiving order and the receiving order against him, should be protected.50. The Committee realise that hardships may occasionally occur at present to parties dealing with a person who is subse-quently discovered to be a partner in a firm against which a receiving order has been made, but the difficulty of adopting the suggestion is, that people doing business with the firm will know only the firm name, and, if the requirements of the Regis-tration of Business Names Act have not been complied with, - may be unable to ascertain the names of the partners. We think the better solution is the enforcement of the Registration of Business Names Act (see paragraph 19 above) rather than any amendment of the Bankruptcy Act in the sense proposed.Bankruptcy Act, 1914, Part VI (Supplemental Provisions) and Part VIII (General).51. No complaint or suggestion regarding the existing sections of these parts of the Act has been made to us.Limited Liability Companies.52. Several witnesses have complained that persons on the eve of bankruptcy, or who are undischarged bankrupts, have availed themselves of the Company Law to enable them to trade, and often to trade fraudulently, under the name oft a private limited company, commonly called &quot; a one-man-company.&quot; We are very sensible of the. evils which have been caused to the trading community by these means, but we- consider the subject to be outside our Terms of Reference and to be one that can only be properly dealt with by a consideration and review of the Company Law as a whole.Aliens, Deportation of.53. The majority of the witnesses desired that the Court of Bankruptcy should have power to recommend alien bankrupts for deportation at any time during, or after, the Public Examina-tion.   So far as the question lies within the scope of our enquiry,
and with proper limitations to exclude from its operation aliens who have been established in this country for a period of years, we think such power might be useful.Registration of High Court Judgments.54. During the enquiry our attention was called to the fact that, whilst under Section 183 of the County Courts Act, 1888, all County Court judgments of  10. and upwards have to be registered, no such provision applies to High Court judgments. This subject is not directly within our Terms of Reference and we express no opinion upon it except that it appears to be a matter worthy of consideration.Limitation on Deeds of Assignment Constituting an. Act ofBankruptcy.55. The last suggestion With which we need deal was that a Deed of Arrangement should not constitute an act of bank-ruptcy where it was assented to by a majority in number and three-fourths in value of the creditors. A limitation on the rigbt to use a Deed of Arrangement as an act of bankruptcy to ground a petition was imposed in 1913 (see Section 24 of the Deeds of Arrangement Act, 1914), and we think that this is sufficient and that no alteration of the Act in this respect is required.&apos;   SUMMARY OP RECOMMENDATIONS. Bankruptcy Act, 1914, Part VII (Bankruptcy Offences).56. Sub-sections (4), (5), (9) (10), (11), (12), (13), (14) and (15) of Section 154 should be amended so as to provide that the acts and the defaults of a. debtor, which by those sub-sections are made criminal offences, if done or committed within. six months of the presentation of a bankruptcy petition, by or against him, on which a receiving order is made, shall be made criminal offences if done or committed within 12 months before the piesentation of such petition.57. The law should be altered so as to provide, either by a new sub-section to Section 154 or by amendment of Section 156, sub-section (b) (if not already sufficiently wide), that a collusive execution suffered or permitted by the bankrupt should subject him to liability to criminal proceedings.58. Section 158 should be amended so as to make failure to keep and preserve proper books of account criminal in the case of a first bankruptcy, subject to the following conditions : (a) The present proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 158 of the Act, with the substitution of five hundred pounds for one hundred pounds, should be retained as a pro-tection to the honest retailer selling goods in the ordinary course of his business.
-   .2(*8(b) The law should further define the books to be kept,so that-they shall include accounts of all goods sold and bought, and sufficient details of such goods, and of the buyers and sellers thereof, respectively, to enable the goods and the buyers and sellers thereof to be identifiable.(c) No prosecution for this offence should take place beforetwo years after the passing of the Act.59. The proviso to Section 161 should, be repealed, and after the words in the section &quot; if it appears to the Court &quot;that there is a reasonable probability that the debtor will be convicted &quot; there should be inserted the words &quot; and that the circumstances are such as to render a prosecution desirable.&quot;60. Section 163 should be repealed.61. The law should be altered so as to give Courts of Summary Jurisdiction power to inflict up to twelve months&apos; imprisonment for a bankruptcy offence, instead of only six months as at present.62. The law should be altered so as to provide that as regards sub-sections (13), (14) and (15), of Section 154, the maximum punishment should be five years&apos; penal servitude.63. The law should be altered so as to provide that it shall be a criminal offence to receive property unlawfully obtained contrary to the provisions of sub-sections (13), (14) and (15), of Section 154.64. The law should be altered to embody a provision regarding venue similar to that in Section 39 (1) of the Larceny Act, 1916, which provides that &quot; a person charged with any offence against this Act may be proceeded against, indicted, tried and punished in any country or place in which he was apprehended or is in custody as if the offence had been committed in that country or place : and for any purposes incidental to or consequential on the prosecution, trial, or punishment of the offence, it shall be deemed to have been committed in that country or place.&apos;&apos;Bankruptcy Act, 1914, Part I.65. The law should be altered so as to provide that the Court shall pronounce on the discharge of every bankrupt on a date to be fixed as soon as may be after the granting by the Board of Trade of the Trustee&apos;s release (unless the bankrupt has himself already applied for his discharge), but not later than two years after the close of the Public Examination, if the Trustee has not been released by that time; the Court to have power to require the bankrupts attendance at the hearing.. 66- The existing statutory minimum period of suspension of discharge imposed in certain circumstances by Section 26, sub-section (2) (ii), should be abolished..
. &quot;    -Bankruptcy Act, 1914, Part.II:67. The law should be altered by the&apos;insertion in Section 39, sub-section (I), of the words &quot; which is followed by an order of adjudication &apos;,&apos; after the words &quot; receiving order.&quot;   &quot;68. The law should be altered to place oh the same footing all the modes of administration of the estate of a bankrupt or insolvent who has previously been bankrupt, i.e., Section 39 should be made to apply to a second or subsequent Receiving Order followed by the acceptance or approval of a composition or scheme and also where a prior bankruptcy is followed by an Administration Order under Section 130 (administration of a deceased insolvent&apos;s estate).69. Finally, we report that on most of the questions considered by us the conclusions arrived at have been agreed to unanimously. In the cases where a difference of opinion has arisen, we have very carefully considered and discussed the subject, but in no instance has it been thought necessary by the minority to give separate expression to their opinion, and the view of the majority has been accepted in such cases and appears in the Report.70. The Committee desire to express their high appreciation of the services rendered by their Secretary, Mr. S. AY. Hood, of the Board of Trade, both in the collection and presentation of &quot;evidence, in the drafting of this Report, and throughout the. enquiry. His work has been of the greatest assistance to the Committee.B. W. Hansell (Chairmm.). ; V. ,   Gr- M. Gillett.- - James Martin. &apos;A. 0. Miles. W. H. Whitelock. IT. F. Carlill. .: - &apos;S. W.
