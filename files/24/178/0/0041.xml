CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY&apos;[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)CONFIDENTIAL.CABINET.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN the course of my conversation with M. Briand in Paris, he raised again the question of Poland&apos;s claim to a permanent seat on the Council. I told him that, having been absent from home for nearly seven weeks, I could not pledge my Government until I had had an opportunity of again discussing the question with them, but that I should be glad to know, in order that I might report them to my colleagues, what were the grounds on which France based Poland&apos;s claim.M. Briand replied that it was certain that Germany and Poland would still have many subjects of difference which would come before the Council, whether in regard to minorities or to the Polish corridor and Danzig; that obviously there was much that was intolerable in the present situation; and that one could not look at the map of East Prussia without feeling that sooner or later some accommodation must be discovered. He repeated the regret which he had previously expressed to me about the manner in which the Vilna and Memel questions had been handled or mishandled, and he seemed vaguely to hope that Memel might yet in some way be found to be the key to a solution. In any case he had begged Count Skrzynski not to lose sight of the practical or to live exclusively in the ideal and not to close his mind to any possibility of an arrangement.Actuated by this desire to bring Germany and Poland together and to find some kind of compromise between them, M. Briand argued that they were far more likely to settle their grievances in an amicable and reasonable way if they met on an equality at the Council. They would then come under the influence of the Council spirit of friendliness and conciliation and the other Powers sitting round the table could give words of advice or urge moderation as might be opportune. If, on the other hand, Germany were admitted and Poland were excluded, both parties might be less reasonable ; Poland certainly would be less accommodating and would suffer under a sense of inequality and injustice.Secondly, M. Briand observed that, if Poland were a member of the Council, she would plead her own case. If Poland were not a member of the Council, France must necessarily be her porte-parole and advocate at every moment. France had her own difficulties to settle with Germany; he did not wish to add to them and complicate their solution by becoming the spokesman of Poland. That would be a position Avhich would be very disagreeable to him and hampering to his policy of reconciliation.M. Briand added some minor reasons. Belgium must retire almost at the same moment as Germany entered. This would be disagreeable to French opinion though it was inevitable. The admission of another ex-Ally would take the sting out of Belgium&apos;s withdrawal, and there would be nothing more to be said. Further, from the point of view of the development of the Locarno spirit in Poland, there could be no doubt that, if Poland were not elected, it would greatly shake Count Skrzynski&apos;s position and lend strength to his critics, whereas if he could show that by the policy of moderation which he had there pursued he had won a seat for Poland at the Council, his authority would be strengthened, and it would be easier for him to make further concessions.Personally I feel that there is great force in the first two arguments, and that some importance attaches to the last. As regards the first, namely, the inequality arising when of two parties to a dispute before the Council one is a member of the Council for all purposes and the other merely invited to the table for that particular discussion, M. Briand&apos;s contention seems to me greatly strengthened by what I observed during the fortnight I spent in Geneva in December, when the question of Mosul was under discussion. I could not help feeling that our position was invidious, that we could more easily have come to an agreement with the Turk if his representative^ and ours had been on exactly the same footing, and that independent members of the Council themselves felt the gene of this inequality and were less ready to decide in our 3287 [14168]1
favour because they felt suspect of partiality to the Power which was their colleague as against the Power which was a stranger to the Council. My own disposition, there-fore, weighing all the circumstances, is to support the claim of Poland. Ixthink-thati by so doing we shall best serve the cause of peace, and, as far as I can judge from the opinion of the other Powers represented on the Council, we shall be acting in accordance with the general wish. We might find ourselves isolated if we adopted an attitude of opposition.A. C.Foreign Office, February 1, 1926.P.S. Since this note was dictated, the Italian Ambassador has informed me that Italy attaches importance to the election of Poland to a permanent seat.
