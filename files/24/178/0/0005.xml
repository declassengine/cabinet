This document is the, property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence, December, 1925.17SECRET.6 &amp;8 Copy No.c.i.D.-&amp;mm.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.THE  EXTENSION OF SOVIET INFLUENCE IN ASIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate, for the information of the Committee of Imperial Defence, a memorandum by the General Staff on the Extension of Soviet Influence in Asia with an illustrative map.L. W.-E.The War Office,15th December, 1925.1. In December, 1924, a Memorandum* (0149/486) was prepared by the General Staff pointing out that the Government of the U.S.S.R. has embarked on a policy of territorial expansion in Central Asia and foreshadowing some of the possible consequences which such a policy might have on British interests if measures were not taken to check its development.Since that date, a considerable amount of further information on this subject has been obtained. Moreover, the Soviet authorities appear to have made appreciable progress towards the attainment of their objectives in certain directions. ,It is therefore thought desirable now to summarise the principal events which have taken place during the last 12 months, and to review the situation generally in order to ascertain whether these developments are such as to constitute a threat to the integrity of British status in the East and whether our.existing dispositions are adequate to cope with possibilities which may arise in the near future.2. From the strategical point of view, Soviet operations in Asia may be divided into three main theatres : (1) Far East. Which may be sub-divided into : (a) Chinese Eastern Railway Vladivostock zone.(b) Kalgan Canton zone, based on Mongolia.(c) Mongolia, including the Urga Tibet line.(2) Central Asia. Which may be sub-divided into : (a) Sin-Kiang (i.e., Chinese Turkestan) 1(b) Afghanistan y based mainly on Russian Turkestan.(c) North-east Persia J(3) Western Asia. Which may be sub-divided into : (a) Iraq and north-west Persia.(b) Turkey.It is proposed to review these separately.3. Fak East.(a) As the Chinese Eastern Railway Vladivostock zone has little or no connection with British interests, it can be dismissed briefly. It need only be said that Russian and Japanese aspirations in this area appear to be directly opposed and that, in short, the stage appears to be set in a manner almost identical with that which preceded the Russo-Japanese War of 1904.* Not circulated to the Committee of Imperial Defence. Copies were sent to the Foreign Office and the India Office.(B25/18)   80   12/25   W.O.P.   2458
&apos;VV&apos;;        &apos; -      2( ) As regards the Kalgan Canton zone, Soviet activity has been mainly concerned with the organization of support for Marshal Feng-Yu-Hsiang, the underlying political motive being undoubtedly the excitation and support of all elements in China which are likely to maintain anti-foreign (especially anti-British and anti-American) ideals.The support accorded has consisted of money, war material, propaganda and a modicum of Red personnel. It is reported that between 1st January, 1925, and the date of his recall (end of August), the Soviet Minister in the Far East, Karakhan, had expended on propaganda no less than  2,600,000 out of a total vote of  12,000,000 which had been set aside by Moscow for world-wide propaganda in 1925.In addition to this, a considerable amount of war material has been, and is still being, supplied to Feng by the Soviet military authorities who have instituted a workable line of communication connecting Kalgan with Urga. Transport on this line, which is some 650 miles in length, and which traverses a large stretch of the Gobi Desert, consists of a mixture of motor vehicles, bullock-carts and camels. In spite of the difficulties inherent in such an undertaking, it has been estimated by a competent and reliable authority that up to 300 tons a month of armament and munitions (including field guns) were being transported during August and September from Urga to Kalgan.From the purely military point of view, this amount is quite inadequate to cope with the requirements of any serious operations of war and is probably by no means commensurate with the expenditure and labour involved. Yet it gives a useful indication of the length to which the Soviet authorities will go towards giving a tangible sign that they are supporting the cause of the &quot; oppressed nationals &quot; of China. The same object is discernible in the recent flight of six Red military aeroplanes from Moscow to Pekin via Urga and the Gobi, and probably in the recent announcement that  12,600,000 has been allotted for the construction of a railway from Kiakhta to Urga and eventually to Pekin.As regards Red military personnel in the Far East, reports are conflicting. A report dated 1st October, 1925, indicated that a Red Russian formation, which included 12 field guns and a proportion of cavalry, was being formed in Honan at Loyanghsien for service in Feng&apos;s Army ; and a Tartar unit about 2,000 strong is said to be under formation near Kalgan. But these reports need further confirmation. On the other hand, the presence of numerous Red officials and &quot; instructors &quot; is undeniable.Summing up the present situation in this zone, it may be said that the efforts of the Soviet authorities have not been attended so far by the success expected at Moscow. Dissatisfaction has been expressed at the results produced, Karakhan is for the time being under a cloud, and it is possible that supplies and money will shortly be reduced. A good deal will depend on the future activities and on the success or failure of Marshal Feng. The important point to note is the Soviet plan for acquiring a definite interest in Chinese affairs through the agency of this leader and his Chinese supporters.(c) In Mongolia, Soviet penetration has been attended with much more tangible results. Although this Republic still nominally forms part of the Chinese Empire, it is no exaggeration to say that in reality it is now virtually a unit of the U.S.S.R.All commands in the Mongol Red Army are now held by Russians, Colonel Neklindov being Chief of the Staff. He disposes of the services of powerful Russian cadres and staffs of a total strength of about 5,000, of *whom no doubt a considerable proportion are Buriats.* Moreover, the Mongolian Army obtains the entirety of its war material from Soviet sources.The consolidation of Mongolia is well illustrated by the development of the Mongol Red Army. Originating from the guerilla Red bands of 1920-1, this now consists, according to our information, of 3 Divisions of Cavalry, totalling 36,000 men approximately. 2 Independent Cavalry Brigades (in process of formation). 3 Regiments Horse Artillery, totalling 81 guns. 1 Brigade Field Artillery, totalling 12 guns.&quot; Brigade&quot; (sic). Infantry, totalling 10,000 men approximately. Various technical and administrative units.* In this connection it is interesting to note that Buriats, when trained by Russian agency, have often been of considerable value to Moscow, not only politically but also as military leaders and instructors. Examples are Aguan Dorji who achieved appreciable results against us in Tibet in 1905, and whose influence is still felt in those regions, and Zerampil.t Additional formations appear to be contemplated and reports indicate that it is intended to station a &quot; 1st Mongolian Red National Division &quot; at Urga and a second at Kobdo.
All the above appear to be sufficiently well organized for the type of warfare likely to be undertaken and to dispose of a considerable number of machine guns. The predominance of cavalry is noteworthy.In addition, a Mongolian Air Force is reported to exist, organised into two squadrons of eight aeroplanes each, their station being at Lake Koso Gol, about 350 miles north-west of Urga. It is estimated by our Air Staff that about 24 machines have been supplied by Russia to Mongolia.   The pilots are said to be Soviet officers.The O.G.P.U. has long been firmly established in Mongolia, about 500 being reported at Urga. Moreover, a Commissar has recently been appointed to the district of Uriankhai, the capital of which is Kobdo, and it is therefore to be presumed that O.G.P.U. troops are probably in that town as well.It would therefore appear that the Soviet Union is now paramount in Mongolia, though this is in direct violation of the Sino-Soviet Agreement of 3rd May, 1924, by which Moscow recognized Western Mongolia as part of the Republic of China and undertook to withdraw all troops of the Soviet Union from that territory.The British Military Attache, Pekin, writing on 15th September, 1925, summarized the intentions of the Soviet Government as follows : (a) To gain complete control of the Mongolian Government, which at present isalmost an accomplished fact.(b) To get the complete monopoly of all trade, import and export, in Mongolia tothe exclusion of all other nationals. This is also practically accomplished. Part of the Soviet programme in this respect is the railway construction project between Chita and Urga.(c) To get the monopoly in the exploitation of the natural resources of Mongolia.(d) To gain complete control of the north-west of China, with Feng-Yu-Hsiang asthe figure-head, to counteract the influence of Japan with Chang-Tso-lin in Manchuria.(e) To make Feng-Yu-Hsiang the strong man of China and in that manner gaincontrol over China and so strike a blow at all other interested powers.He added : &quot; At present Feng-Yu-Hsiang is not ready to engage in a war on a large scale, and he is not willing to precipitate a struggle unless forced into it. However, next spring, when all his preparations are completed, he might attempt, assisted by the-Soviet and perhaps by some Mongolian troops, to establish himself as the power in China.&quot;Before leaving the &quot; Far East Theatre &quot;, mention must be made of a subsidiary line of Soviet penetration which is also based on Urga. This line runs in the direction of Tsaidam and Lhassa, with Nepal and Bhutan as probable ulterior objectives.A reliable report, dated 30th April, 1925, stated that an expedition under a certain ex-Colonel Kozlov would start from Urga in May with the object of carrying out a scientific expedition to Tsaidam and a political expedition thence to Lhassa in order to &quot; establish relations with the Dalai Lama and engage in revolutionary propaganda, especially in the Tibetan Army.&quot;Independently of this report, H.M. Minister at Pekin reported that Kozlov travelled vicL Kalgan and Lanchowfu (in Kansu), his probable itinerary including Koko Nor, Yarkand and Nepal.The reasons why the circuitous Yarkand route was used in preference to the direct one from Tsaidam to Lhassa are not known, but the most probable would appear to be (a) To co-ordinate Soviet activities in Sinkiang and Kansu with the proposals forTibet and Nepal.(b) To reach Nepal with less fear of detection.(c) To traverse districts more favourable to the dissemination of Soviet doctrines^At any rate, the progress and work of this mission are well worth watching. More recent information shows that there are now at least three Russian missions carrying out anti-British work in Tibet namely, those of (1) Kozlov, already described.(2) Mahandra Partab, who is to join Kozlov, and thence to branch off to Lhassaand Nepal. (3) Babinin, with a party from Urga.(2468) A 1
The last named has instructions from the Komintern, inter alia, to &quot; bring to the knowledge of the population that the U.S.S.R. would support a movement in favour of the complete independence of Tibet&quot;. This expedition has been assigned a credit of -65,000 sterling.4. Central Asia. (a) Sin-Kiang.In the General Staff Memorandum (0149/486) of December, 1924, the establishment of the Soviet Republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbegistan and Kazakistan was regarded as a &apos;  preliminary towards further infiltration Eastwards ; and the probable formation of a second series of Republics, notably Uighuria,* Jungaria* and Alti-Shahr was foreshadowed. This forecast has now in the main been realised.The latest and most important step is that the region known formerly as Chinese Turkestan has now become the subject of an agreement between Moscow and Feng in virtue of which it is to become the Soviet National Republic of Sin-Kiang. It is reported that armed bands of Red troops have already percolated into this area.. This sovietization of Sin-Kiang is a logical sequence of the sovietization of Outer Mongolia. It awaited only the conciliation and consolidation of the more Western territories which are now known as the Nationalist Soviet Republics of Central Asia. This now appears to have been successfully accomplished. At any rate, reports of revolts in these areas against Bolshevik domination have for some months been somewhat, conspicuous for their absence.A kindred project is the formation of an analogous Soviet Socialist Republic in the neighbouring Province of Kansu. This is also reported to have received the approval of Feng.The policy of Moscow towards Sin-Kiang was described very clearly on 26th September by Karakhan, whose proposals received the full support of the Sovnarkom and Politbureau. The following are relevant extracts from his speech : &quot; The Sin-Kiang Province, almost entirely severed from Central China, is an immense country from the territorial point of view, having an extent of about 1 million square versts with a population of about 3 millions. Squeezed in between the U.S.S.R., Mongolia, India and Tibet, this little-known country is likely to play a great part in the development of the economic life of the Middle East, both with respect to the national re-birth of the peoples of the East and the liberation of the same from the annexionist aims of international capital. . . . The majority of the inhabitants are Sarts, Khirghiz and Kalmucks, kindred in race to the population of Soviet Uzbegistan and Turkmenistan, and only a very insignificant section are Chinese and Mongols. The Sarts number about I\ millions. Since the formation of the Soviet Republics of Uzbegistan, Khirghizia and Turkmenistan, constant contact has been established between these Republics and the Sin-Kiang Province, and has yielded excellent results, both with respect to revival of trade and with respect to penetration of our influence into the most outlying districts of this country. The establishment of our consulates in the capital of Sin-Kiang, Urumchi, and in the towns of Kuldja, Kashgar, Sharasume and Chuguchak, has not only made it possible for our representatives to acquaint themselves with the position of the country and the state of the popular masses, but has served also as a bond drawing the kindred Sart and Khirghiz-Kalmuck tribes of this part of China into touch with the Sart-Khirghiz population of Turkestan, and increasing their natural inclination towards the U.S.S.R.   .   .   .&quot;&quot; The Mussulman population of the district is strongly anti-Chinese and proclamation of independence, particularly under the patronage of the friendly o U.S.S.R., will undoubtedly be met with enthusiasm by the people. . . . The transformation of Sin-Kiang into an independent province,&quot; or, more correctly, independent republic, would be an important step towards the final consolidation of our influence in Central Asia, and also towards seizure of new routes upon Tibet and India. By gradually forming a wide zone of nationalist republics from the Caspian to the Pacific we shall not only be creating protection fbr the U.S.S.R. against all aggressive movements of the imperialists, but would also create for oursehres a &apos; point d&apos;appui&apos; for an active policy in Tibet.&quot;* These are not shown on the map attached, but Jungaria may be taken to coincide with the most westerly portion of Mongolia whilst TJighuria probably overlaps from Russian Turkestan over the northern portion of Chinese Turkestan.
It only remains to note the extent to which the Soviet authorities have so far succeeded or failed in this programme.Concrete indications of success may be said to be : (a) The establishment of Soviet Consulates (i.e., propaganda centres) at Kashgar,Kuldja and Urumchi and possibly at Yarkand, Chuguchak and Sharasume.(b) The establishment of a revolutionary centre at Andijan and the location of aconsiderable number of trained &quot; militant agents&quot; in various localities in Sin-Kiang (22 were despatched in March after graduation from courses at Moscow and Tashkent, including 2 Tibetans).(c) The reported presence of armed Red bands in Northern Sin-Kiang (confirmationstill required).(d) A speech by Litvinov (Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs) to the Sovnarkomon9th October, in which he is reported to have said : &quot; During the recent conference with the delegation of Feng- Yu-Hsiang, it appeared that Feng had no objection in principle to the creation of an independent republic in the province of Sin-Kiang, but only on condition that the Soviet Government supported his candidature as head of the future United Chinese State, and on condition that the Chinese were assured rights of settlement in Sin-Kiang. Thus, this question may now be considered practically settled:&quot;On the other hand, we have the opinion of H.B.M.&apos;s Consul-General at Kashgar (dated September, 1925) that Soviet infiltration did not appear to him to have made much progress up-to-date and that he considered that the Chinese Viceroy at Urumchi was still able to keep control of the political situation.(b) Afghanistan.There seems no doubt that the action recently taken by the Government of India and the activities of H.M.&apos;s Minister at Kabul have had a beneficial effect, the result being that the Amir has now become very apprehensive of Soviet designs.This is all to the good ; but it cannot be stated too emphatically that at the best we can only say that the evil has been temporarily abated. Moscow is bent on permeating Afghanistan with Russian influence. There is not the shadow of a possibility that she will cease her work in this direction. Moreover, as H.M.&apos;s Representative at Moscow pointed out in his Memorandum of 24th July, it is very necessary that we should now realize and make provision for the fact that Russia is now growing stronger economically and not weaker and that her pressure on Afghanistan will increase in the future in direct proportion to this accretion of strength.Summarizing Bolshevik activities during the last year, the following may be said to be the most noteworthy items of progress : (a) The creation of  a pseudo-Afghan Air Force under complete Russian control.The strength of this Air Force may be taken as approximately one squadron.All material and skilled personnel are obtained from.Soviet sources, and anumber of Afghan pilots are being trained at Moscow. (6) The development of the  Bukhara Termez line  of communication.    this includes the completion of the railway to Kilif  and extension towardsTermez ; improvement of bridging facilities over the River Oxus at Termez ;a survey for a motor route from Termez to Kabul; and the development ofan air route between these centres.(c) Construction of a telegraph line from Kushk to Herat.   Negotiations for its extension to Maimana and Mazar-i-Sharif were undertaken, but have so far failed. The line is now to be carried to Kandahar, the cost of construction being debited against the subsidy account (vide below).(d) The establishment of an Afghan Communist Party Headquarters in Kabul and apparently also cells in other Afghan towns, together with a Bureau for the forging of passports in Kabul.(e) The reported location of propaganda and intelligence centres along the IndianNorth-West Frontier ; dumps of arms and listening-in W/T sets; and the support of anti-British elements on the Frontier such as the Hindustani fanatic colony at Chamarkand.(f) Certain commercial exploitations, e.g., concessions for the oil and iron of theHerat area, development of telegraphs and certain financial deals connected with bullion and currency in Kabul.
Directives have also been issued  or an extensive percolation into the Afghan Army. -Endeavours are to be made to install strong Russian cadres in the Afghan Regular Army to obtain the addition of an extra brigade (presumably as a key-unit) ;  to obtain contracts for the re-armament of the army ; and to obtain permission for the erection of&quot; a smokeless powder factory at Kabul.The quid pro quo offered for these concessions is extensive financial assistance. This takes the form of a subsidy in kind. It is estimated that during the past years this subsidy has exceeded half a million sterling in value, a sum the real value of which can best be obtained by contrasting it with our proposed subsidy of 7 lakhs (say,  50,000) a year.Under cover of this subsidy, the Soviet have introduced into Afghanistan a considerable amount of war material, the result being that the Afghan Army is now to a large extent dependent on Moscow for its supply of spares and of technical personnel.(c) Norih-East Persia.Turcoman activity mentioned in the General Staff Memorandum 0159/486 continued during the spring and summer. Latterly, however, Persian Government forces have succeeded in bringing this movement to some extent under control, a result due partially to the withdrawal from the Turcomans of Soviet support when the latter transferred their main activities to the Far Eastern theatre.The infiltration of Bolshevik emissaries into Meshed continues, but apart from this -the situation in this particular portion of the theatre under review appears quiescent.5. Western Asia.(a) North- West Persia.Intrigues against British interests still continue unabated, but active measures on the part of the Bolsheviks are in abeyance owing to the predominence of Riza Khan. The fact that this ruler personifies Persian national independence stultifies one of the principal slogans of Soviet propaganda the cry for independent nationalities in the East.Moscow now appears intent on obtaining close and friendly relations with the Persian Government and all subversive activities on the part of the Third International will probably be kept under strict control. Reports have been received which indicate Bolshevik complicity in the recent risings of the Shahsavan tribe (near Ardabil), but these are merely sporadic movements and should not be confused with Soviet policy as a whole.        &quot;In general, it may be said that the policy of Moscow is to form a Turkish-Persian-Afghan bloc of an anti-British orientation.   Thus, Litvinov on 9th October stated : &quot; The idea of forming a Turco-Persian-Afghan alliance has once more come to the fore in connection with the Mosul question. The categorical statement of the N.K.I.D. (Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs), made to the representatives of the Mussulman countries, that the U.S.S.R. was prepared to support the Turkish people with all the forces at its disposal in the event of a war between Great Britain and Turkey, produced a great impression on the directors of the policies of Persia and Afghanistan......&quot;This passage is merely quoted to illustrate the policy of Moscow. That any real, progress has been made up to date in this direction is very doubtful.(b) Turkey.The attitude of the U.S.S.R. towards Turkey has been outlined in the above paragraph. Soviet overtures towards Angora appeared to have ceased during the first half of this year, but revived immediately the possibility of friction over the Mosul question appeared. Thus, Chicherin, at a secret session of the Sovnarkom on 22nd August, said : &quot; The course of events over the Mosul question has forced Turkey to seek a way towards rapprochement with the U.S.S.R. The Turkish Government who did not desire to give up Mosul are prepared for an open struggle with Britain. The absence of necessary means makes it difficult for the Turkish Government to turn their desire into action.   The Soviet Foreign Office informed the Turkish Government
6. Conclusions.1. Summarizing this cursory review of Soviet political and military activities during 1925, it may be said that perhaps the most remarkable feature of the situation is the persistency with which the Soviet authorities are maintaining the offensive along every possible avenue. There has not been the faintest indication of any slackening or desire for peace on their part. No sooner does activity in one theatre die down than immediate attempts are made to exploit another line of possible advance. The one exception is the Western or European front, which has been quiet throughout the year, but that only because it was abundantly clear that there was no chance of progress in that direction. In short, the settlement of Europe has had the effect of deciding Russia to concentrate the whole of her energies on expansion in Asia. There, has recently been a decrease in the strength of the Red military forces on the Western frontier, and corresponding increase towards the south.2. It remains to forecast the future, and to see if this policy is likely to have any injurious effect on British interests.There are indications at present of a definite decrease in, and even reaction from, Soviet endeavours in what has been termed the Far Eastern theatre ; and, provided that the present Mosul negotiations can be successfully carried through, there would not appear to be much to fear from developments in the Western theatre. There remains the Central theatre, and, above all, that portion known as Sin-Kiang. Soviet progress of recent date in this region has already been outlined in pages 4-5. It is considered certain that further material success will attend their endeavours in the near future.The unfortunate fact must be realised that in the whole of Sin-Kiang there is no fighting population worthy of the name. There are no organizations which are at all likely to fight in defence of the existing regime or of Chinese suzerainty. Moreover, the so-called Chinese forces are composed to a large extent of Dungans and Taranchis, the majority of whom are drawn from the province of Kansu, which now appears to be ready for conversion into a Soviet Republic (vide map). There is thus no obstacle to the free and unfettered sweep of Bolshevik influence ; nothing concrete to prevent the march of Red formations into Sin-Kiang as soon as Moscow so desires, except only such disconnected resistance and diversion as the Basmachi on the Russian side of the border may offer.An important corollary to this is that, as matters are at present, whatever diplomatic and intelligence organization we may consider it advisable to create and maintain in that country can be destroyed by Moscow practically with a wave of the hand whenever it suits them to do so.Further, the sovietization of Sin-Kiang will give the U.S.S.R. a long stretch of continuous frontier with British India. Thus, the policy of Moscow to pierce a cordon of buffer states (vide General Staff Memorandum 0149/486 of December, 1924) will be carried an important step forward.3. A review of the present situation would not be complete without reference to the Red Army. The foregoing pages deal chiefly with Soviet political penetration. assisted, when and where necessary, by units of the State Political Department Troops (O.G.P.U.). But it must also be mentioned that, pari passu with these developments, there has been a slow but steady and quite perceptible improvement in the organization, training, equipment and (above all) moral of the Red Army. Owing to the economic improvement of Russia generally, this army is now obtaining a far more liberal supply of equipment, uniform and war material of all descriptions than was hitherto possible.   And7     . f.that the U.S.S.R. regards the right of Turkey to Mosul as inalienable and is prepared, in the event of relations between Turkey and England becoming acute, to give her support to the former.I assume that the decision of Turkey to enter the road of conflict against our enemy can only be welcomed by us.&quot;Although there have been several reports to the effect, it is considered very doubtful &quot;if any definite military convention between Turkey and the U.S.S.R, has ever been concluded. On the other hand, it can be stated with conviction that if at any time in the future an open rupture should take place in our relations with Turkey, Russia would undoubtedly support her materially. In future, therefore, when considering matters relative to the defence of Iraq, we should always envisage the possibility of having to contend not only with the Turkish Army but with considerable Red forces in addition.
it is not without significance that, at a time when the nations of Europe are bent on reduction of expenditure on armaments, the Soviet Union has just decided to increase its Army Budget from 412 million to 612 million roubles ( 61,200,000), an increase of nearly 50 per cent.It is not intended to imply that this army will ever be used directly against us, but it is as well to note that with regard to incursions into Central Asia it can now be regarded as a workable and decisive factor in the execution of Soviet policies should these meet with any attempts at opposition.   And there has recently been a definite concentration of&quot; force along the valley of the Oxus and from Samarkhand towards Tashkent.
