[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. JPrinted /or the Cabinet,   January 1926.SECRET.C.P. 24 (26)CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.AFGHANISTAN. I previous papers: CP. 517 (25), OP. 524 (25), CP. 7 (26).    ;I circulate for the information of my colleagues an extract dealing with Afghan relations with Russia, taken from the Summary of Events in Afghanistan between August and November 1925 prepared by our Minister at Kabul.As indicated in the footnotes, the telegraphic correspondence already circulated in CP. 7 (26) throws later light on some of the points mentioned.BIRKENHEAD.25th January 1926.14. The negotiations for the Russc-Afghan Trade Convention, which were interrupted by Monsieur Lejawa Miirafs return to Moscow in August, have not yet been resumed. It is reported, however, from a reliable source that agents of the Vneshtorg are shortly to be introduced into Afghanistan for the purpose of obtaining a monopoly of trade with the ultimate object of the dissemination of revolutionary propaganda among the agricultural population.15. An interesting example of the manner in which the Russians are pushing their wares in this country is to be found in their attempt to gain possession of the trade in oil, which has hitherto been obtained exclusively from India. Kerosene and petrol are now brought from Baku in drums containing 15 gallons each, which are sold at Rs. 55 Kabuli and Rs. 95 Kabuli a drum, respectively. This works out at about 3s. a gallon for kerosene and 4 s. 9cZ. a gallon for petrol, prices which are just able to undercut the Indian trader, but which involve a dead loss to the Russians on account of the enormous transport costs aud the high percentage of leakage that takes place on the road. It is believed that an order for 50,000 gallons of aviation spirit has recently been placed by the War Office with the Soviet Legation.16. The number of Russian air personnel in Kabul has increased to 33, and the Afghan Air Force is now entirely under Russian control.&apos;8 During the Amir&apos;s recent visit to Kandahar, a fairly regular air mail service with Kabul was maintained without any serious accident. Attempts were made by the Russians while in Kandahar to obtain permission to fly near the Indian frontier and to remain behind in Kandahar to construct an aerodrome after the Amir had left. I had previously warned the War Minister privately against granting any such permission, and both requests were refused. It seems likely, however, that the Russians will attempt to take advantage of. the Amir&apos;s forthcoming visit to Jalalabad to impress on him the necessity for establishing an air base there which would be open all the year round and would afford greater facilities for training than the higher altitude of Kabul.j&quot;It seems reasonable to anticipate that any air base in the neighbourhood of the Indian frontier which was manned wholly or partially by Russians would develop quickly into a focus of anti-British intrigue, and that it would be in the best interests both of Afghanistan and of India that the Russians should be prevented from extending the sphere of their activities into the south-eastern zone. Such a policy should lead eventually to the elimination of Russians altogether from the Afghan Air Force, for they are unlikely to continue to spend large sums of money on this force unless they are given facilities for using it for their own purposes.17. It is understood that the Afghan Government has agreed to the construction of the Kabul-Kandahar and Kandahar-Herat telegraph line by Russian personnel, and are considering an offer by the Russians for the free installation of a 20-kilowatt wireless station, which would be capable of communicating as far as Moscow, on the condition that it is worked exclusively by Russians.* But see Kabul telegrams 164 (para. 2) and .166 in CP. 7 (26).t But see Kabul telegrams 154, 159 and 165, Government of India&apos;s telegram 170S S. and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&apos; telegram 41 in CP. 7 (26).954      100   1.26
18. It is believed that Monsieur Stark is negotiating with the Afghan Government for opening a branch of the1&apos;Russian State Bank in Kabul, and is meanwhile conducting with Afghan traders the business of an exchange bank through a member of the Soviet Legation staff.19. A: Russian survey party has been engaged in ! examining the road between Kabttl and Mazar-i-Sharif via the Salang Pass. This Pass, owing to its exceptional steepness near the summit, the difficult nature of the rock, and the great depth of snow which covers if for many months in the year, is one of the most difficult barriers to cross in the whole Hindu Kusti range. The Amir is said to be optimistic that a tunnel, live miles in length, can be profitably constructed through the mountain just below the heavy snowline.20. There can be no doubt that the Russians.are putting forth strong efforts to get the Amir into their clutches and to encourage a revolutionary spirit among :the masses. It seems probable, loo, that they are actuated partly by a desire to create a situation at one of the most vulnerable points in the British Empire&apos;which will cause anxiety to His Majesty s Government and which can be used as a lever for extracting concessions for the Soviet. The utmost vigilance will have to be observed if their activities are to be kept within harmless limits.
