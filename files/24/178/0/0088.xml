Proceedings may be taken by Local Authorities when any smoke is a nuisance, not as now only as regards black smoke.Certain processes in the manufacture of steel are exempted from the Bill and power is taken by Provisional Order (a) to exempt other processes and (b)on the other hand to remove any exemption within five years of the date of the new Act.ClauseJ3B Local Authorities are empowered, and may berequired, to fix standards of smoke emission.     The presumption will then be that any emission above the .- standard is a nuisance a clause 4* The Minister of Health may transfer to theCounty Council the powers of a Local Authority which Is in default.Clause 9. Provision is made for oertain needed extensions of the Alkali Act.The principal proposals of the Bill are -
Clause 10.Local Authorities are empowered, with a view to the prevention of smoke, to make byelaws as to the heating of buildings (but not private dwelling-houses, now exempted from the smoke provisions of the Public Health Acts).Clause 12.At the request of the Board cf Trade, ships are excluded from the Act.

There is a strong demand thatGovernment Establishments should be brought under the general law.     There are constitutional difficulties in doing so, and this Clause is proposed to meet the demand, but a stronger provision may have to be conceded, despite the difficulties.The principal criticism of the Bill is likely to he that it is not sufficiently drastic; but in the present state of Industry a more severe measure does not seem expedient0At the request of the Secretary for Scotland, the Bill contains provisions (clauses 5 to 8 and 14) for the application of the Bill to Scotland,arch- 1986.
