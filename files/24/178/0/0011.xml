COAL.SIR ADAM ftIMM0 recalled that at the Council meeting two months ago he had said he thought the industry had reached bottom,  that there were indications that we were beginning to capture foreign trade and that these indications seemed to lead one to believe that the coal industry might be expected to expand to some extent.     At the meeting in the previous month he emphasised that tendency, and said he thought it was more pronounoed. Today the figures appeared to show that the expansion had gone on very quickly, and relatively speaking, the recent output figures were very satisfactory.     Prom the bottom position about three months ago we had had a steady expansion week by week.     Now if that position could be maintained it would represent a very large increase in the annual production.     The week&apos;s output of coal in tho United Kingdom quoted in the Statistical Tables which had been laid before the Council (see also Tables at the end of these Notes) amounted to 5,555,600 tons, as compared with an output of 4,872,000 tons a month ago, and was now very nearly up ta the output in the corresponding week last year.It had been demonstrated that we can get trade at a price.     It had always&apos;been the view of many that it was only a question of price whether the British coal industry would recover or not, and proceed on a policy of expansion.     At the low prices which had recently been ruling it was olear that we could hold our own against foreign competition, and while some of this expansion of output might be looked upon as being seasonal, there appeared to be no doubt that the whole position was on a much more solid basis than it was three months ago.     The real difficulty now was to know how these figures were to be supported by costs of production.     Proposals must be awaited from a certain quarter as to how the serious gap between prices and costs of production can be bridged, before anything definite could be said.     Sir Adam HImmo thought that prices of coal could not be put up higher if the coal industry was to be the means of stimulating trade in other directions.     The movement towards a better condition of things in the iron and steel trades looked to be undoubtedly due to the lower prices of coal, and if these lower prices could be maintained they would give the Iron and steel trades a very good chance of meeting foreign competition and gradually expanding their market.     It would be sufficient at the moment, however,  to indloate that the coal trade was in a much healthier and better condition, as far as output was conoerned, than it had been,  and that at the prices which were now being quoted there did not seem to be any reason why expansion should not go on quite steadily.
IRON AND STEEL.SIR A. BALFOUR said that, as regards the Sheffield trades, he was very glad to he able to report that they had started the year probably better than any for the last four at least.   The slump which took place in the last week of November and the early part of December seemed to have passed away.   Very good export orders were being obtained.    The home trade was a little weaker, but that was no doubt due to the holidays.    There was very keen competition for the orders, and very little profit in seme of them.Canada, which had been really a bad market for the Sheffield trades throughout the year, had improved in the last six weeks.    No doubt that improvement was largely due to the harvest.    Japan was still a very bad market, but the improvement in the exchange with Japan was affecting the position somewhat and we were getting more business than we had done in the last six months.South America was quite good.   German competition was found to be falling away very much there, and British firms were getting a good deal of the business formerly done by the Germans.   Australia and New Zealand were quite good also. China, iH spite of the war troubles, was quite a satisfactory market.    Our firms were beginning however to feel the boycott of Hong Kong rather seriously, and in rather an unpleasant way. Orders were offered for materials which had been supplied before, but with the request that they should now be imported without any mark at all.    Of course the firms did not like that because it was throwing away their goodwill, and when they pressed their customers in the matter, the latter suggested that the labels might be sent out with the materials,&apos;and these would then be put on the goods out there.   British firms were resisting this also, as it might have a very serious effect on their goodwill in Southern China, unless it were soon stopped.Generally, the situation was much more hopeful.MR. DORi AN had got out an estimate of December production, in order to have comparative figures for the whole year, and with pig iron he found the production during 1925  to have been about 64 million tons, which was a million tons less than in 192 4, and 4 million tons less than in 1913.    The pig iron position, for all that, was better, with more enquiries, and iron prices had moved up about 2/- a ton.    Of course they had to pay a little more for their coke.   Steel production in 1925 (estimating the December figures) came out at about 7,360,000 tons, which was less by 860,000 tons than last year, and less than it was in 1913, but not by very much.   As to Imports and exports - again estimating the December. figures, - the total imports of Iron and Steel and manufactures thereof were the greatest on record, viz., 2,700,000 tons, whilst the exports were roughly 3 , 700,000 tons, which was approximately a million and a quarter tons,  or 2 6 per cent, less than in 1913, and 4 per cent,  less than 192 4.   Steel enquiries were better.    There again, as had already been remarked at this table, one could get orders at a price, and the trouble was that the price was below the cost of production in the steel trade, but the orders were there - which, they were not a year ago.
IRON AND STEEL (C ON TP. )Steel firms did not quite know at what to estimate the price of coal after the end of April;    they had to put in tenders for rails and other orders at a very cut price, and they hardly knew what to do.    Of course they had to take their courage in their hands and hope for the best, but it would be a poor consolation if they found they had to pay 3/- or 4/- more per ton for coal when the time came.        The wire trade was bad, with very keen competition from Belgium and Germany; the black and galvanised sheet trade was remaining very firm; constructional engineering was quieter and there -were not so many enquiries, but that trade on the whole was fairly well employed.    Continental plates and billets had increased during the holiday week from 3/- to 5/- a ton in price.    The number of furnaces in blast in November 1925 was 141, as compared with 136 in October 1925. and 171 in November 1924.   There might be one or two more blown in, in the course of two or three weeks, if things went on as they had been going.MR. BAKER wrote -&quot;Prom press reports trade appears to be slightly better than a few months ago, but prices continue to fall and are at an unremunerative level.&quot;The fluctuations In the franc, and the strike which has been going on for some time in Belgium, have been advantageous to the British manufacturer.&quot;The South Wales Tinplate Scale shews on the last ascertainment a ten shilling reduction, but ag this reduction would involve a wage only slightly above base rate the employers have agreed to forego the reduction for the present.&quot;There seems to be a general air of optimism in the annual reviews of the industry now appearing in the press, but upon analysis it is difficult to find any real justification for this spirit.&quot;The only gratifying fact that has recently come to hand is that the steelworks of Messrs. Bolckow Vaughan and Company, and the Cargo Fleet Company at Middlesbor ough are so busy that the plant was worked over Christmas, and the only holiday stoppage at these works was confined to two days at New Year&quot; .NON-FBRR OUS . META IS.SIR CECIL BUDD thought he could report satisfactorily, on the whole, in regard to non-ferrous metals.    There had been rather a slowing down in the demand for them during the last few weeks, but he was inclined to think this was only temporary.    Last year we consumed in the United Kingdom about 87 per cent, of the copper which we consumed
$2NON-FERROUS METALS . (CONTD . )In 1913; in lead fle consumed 136 per cent; in spelter 87 per cent and in tin 94 per cent.    Those, he thought, were very satisfactory figures in the circumstances, and he sa?i no definite sign of any  setback,  though we should have a good deal of competition from abroad, and. not least from Germany.ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING .SIR PHILIP NASH   observed that in the heavy electrical manufacturing industry the home trade last year was a little below normal, and he saw no reason why that should change this year.    The export trade last year for heavy plant was very good, and this country probably got Its full share of the world&apos;s business.    The prices were not good, but it certainly paid a manufacturer to take business at the rate that he could get in world competition.    ./hereas the electrical trades had been compared with other trades as fairly busy, Sir P. Nash did not wish the Council to think that they were anything like fully occupied.    There was a very large capacity for manufacture in the electrical trades still unoccupied in this country.There was one point which he desired to emphasise: it was understood -that the Government would be shortly announcing some decision on what is known as the Weir report. That was a matter of very great importance to the industry, and whatever the Government pronouncement might be - whether It was favourable to a standardisation of frequency or not -it would probably release a considerable amount of trade. There was no doubt that certain buyers were holding up orders because of uncertainty as to which way the decision of the Government would go.TEXTILES: COTTON.SIR W. CLARE LEES said that there was very little fresh news of the cotton trade to report since the Council last met. But although there had been nothing definite happening of a very favourable nature, there was nevertheless a much better feeling.    One might perhaps say that trade was not better, but everyone was feeling that they were on a more sound basis of price and  cost.    The reports from abroad of competition, even Japanese competition, showed that m were much closer up to them than we had been for some time, and our feeling was that cotton piece goods now were definitely cheap.    There were very small margins In the intermediate processes.   The raw cotton itself was not high in regard to other world products, compared with the pro-war levels.   Many of the adverse factors which had been hampering us for many yoars had g one .
TEXTILES: COTTON (CONTP.) .There were two points which were likely to worry the industry, for some few months at  any rate.   Firstly as to Syria, with which not a very large trade was done, but It was one of those big little trades; the political disturbances there had caused people to divert shipments from Sjrria and even to draw goods back from Syria to Egypt.    That had caused tremendous congestion in the Egyptian market, and It was thought that the Egyptian trade, which had been quite good, would have a very quiet time for some months.   Secondly the position in China was disappointing in the sense that while Chinese markets were being maintained in very remarkable degree throughout the troubles, the British share of them was not being maintained.   So far as cotton piece goods were concerned, at any rate in the raw grey state, we were undoubtedly losing ground In China to Japan.    On the other hand, where we met Japan in rather finer goods, as in the Dutch. East Indies, evidence was forthcoming as recently as the previous day that Japanese competition was not defeating us, although It was troublesome.MR. JUDSON had nothing good to report about the cotton trade.   Since the Councils last meeting less time had been worked tn the spinning mills than for a year or two past, Mr. Judson had previously mentioned that an attempt had been made the week before the last meeting by the Employers1-Federation to reduce the working hours from 39^- per week to 35.   That failed; for although the employers got 80% of their members in favour of It, they said it was not a sufficient percentage.   However since then they had re-commended a full weelrs stoppage, apart from the other stoppages and apart from the holidays, and this had been fairly generally carried out, so that they had done better from their point of view by stopping the full week, with the other reductions, than by reducing to 35 hours per we-ek..^Stocks of yarn had accumulated to a tremendous degree. A lot of it wps already sold but the people who had bought It would not take delivery.   Cotton had come down in price. These stocks had been built up on higher priced cotton, and whilst some day it would be cleared, the buyers preferred at present to get cheaper yarns elsewhere and leave these stocks in the cellars.    However, since the New Year there had been a lot of enquiries from China and India for prices.   Of course at this season of the year in normal times trade was prosperous, but that wa3 not so this year and had not been so for the past four years.   It ms nevertheless hoped, now that the world was absolutely bare of cotton goods, that a better time for our trade would come this Spring,COL. SEDDON BROWN wrote, on 24th December, as follows&quot;In the American Spinning Section of the Cotton Trade matters are almost as bad as they can be; yarn is being freely offered all round the market at prices which shew a considerable loss to the Spinner, and this In spite of the fact that the Mills spinning American Cotton are still on short-time and are only working 39-g- hours per week.
CONFIDENTIAL.textiles:  COTTON  (CONTD.),&quot;For the past few weeks statistics prove that the production of yarn Is considerably in excess of consumption, and spinners who have good orders booked are experiencing the greatest difficulty in obtaining delivery Instructions against same.     For this reason the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners Association has issued a recommendation to all Spinners in the American section that they extend the Christmas holidays by closing their Mills for&apos;a full week in addition to the recognised holidays.&quot;In the Egyptian Spinning section practically the whole Of the Mills are running full time, but this trade is not as good as it was and orders Fire not finding their way on to Spinners&apos; order books as freely as one would expect.&quot;In the Cloth trade things are undoubtedly bad, certain good orders for India have recently been placed,  more especially in the light fabrics, but taken as a whole cloth prices are so bad that many manufacturers are losing money.&quot;Considerable anxiety Is being experienced with regard to sne of Lancashire&apos;s largest markets, Germany.     Payments are coming in very badly from Germany end the German inability to pay to date has certainly become much more marked during the last few week?.&quot;The depressed condition of the Cotton Trade is probably due to a very large e xtent to the serious drop in the price of raw cotton, both Egyptian and American growths.     Consumers of cloth throughout the whole world do not yet seem to be satisfied that cotton has reached the bottom as regards price, and have not yet sufficient confidence to buy their requirements.      It would almost look as though cotton would have to shew some strength as regards price,  or that the drop will have to be continued until It does find a bottom before the purchasing public will be prepared to buy with sufficient confidence to find full time work for our Lancashire Mills.&quot;TEXTILES: FOOL AND WORSTED.MR. ANDREWS stated that, so far ss unemployment was concerned, a considerable improvement had been shown In the worsted section of the trade.     Unfortunately there was not yet any improvement in the heavy woollen section. Yarn prices from July to October were dominated by the French demand.      German credit was still bad;    consequently they could not buy wool.     The Americans were in a very conservative mood and buying from hand to mouth.     At the moment the English buyers were dominating the wool   prices in all parts of the world.     That was a very favourable condition for us, and we had prices now at a very reasonable level;    not perhaps low, but giving a fairreturn to the wool grower and at the same time low enough for manufacturers to be able to obtain trade.      We have been very short of wool in this country, but it was now beginning to arrive more freely from the Dominions, with the result that the
TEXTILES!  WOOL    AND WORSTED  (CO!?TP ).wool combing section, Instead of working 50 per cent,  as they had been three months ago, were now working 75 per cent.     The spinning section one   might divide into three parts, the worsted home trade, the hosiery, and the Continental trade.     The worsted home trade was fairly good;    the hosiery trade was good;    but the Continental trade was bad on account again of German finance being so bad.     There were plenty of orders in Bradford for yarn for Germany but the exporting firms dared not ship the goods for fear of not being able to get paid,   and also on account of the considerable amount of money that Germany owed to Bradford already.      In the weaving section the worsted again was still good.      The manufacturers were better employed now than they had been at any time during 1925 except perhaps in the early months of January and Februaryi and were booked up fairly well for some few months ahead^The yarn section was still bad, and some of the manu-facturers attributed this to the decreased exports to Japan, That country made only the cheaper class of goods,  and, strange to say, at the present time we found that the best demand was for the dearer goods.     As Sir Adam Nimmo had said with regard to the coal trade, the woollen industry could get business at a price,  and if they could keep wool prices near what they are today, a little lower rather than higher,  they could look forward with a fair amount of confidence.CHEMICALS.MR. PERRY remarked on a satisfactory feature in the chemical and allied trades, namely that the percentage of unemployed workers was somewhat less in November 1925 than it had been in the previous month and in November 1924.      On the other hand, in the &quot;index&quot; commodity,  sulphuric acid, barely 50 per cent, of the country&apos;s plant was at work, this being largely due, he thought, to the continuous foreign competition in fertilisers, super-phosphates in particular, the production of which in this country was still falling very rapidly.     In heavy chemicals the only marked change in the export trade consisted in the serious falling off in our trade with Japan, which used to be a large and important one. There appeared to be a sort of collapse of business in Japan. There were very large stocks now in Japan which had never been the case before,  and no orders were coming forward at all.      On the other hand, the manufacturers of fine chemicals reported a healthy condition in home and export trade.On the whole the chemical trade had perhaps not quite maintained the slight spurt which had been noted last autumn,     The reel reason for this was probably to be found in the uncertain outlook in coal.
9 bPOTTERY.MR. HOLLINS observed that it was rather difficult at this time of year to analyse the position of pottery. There were feelings both of optimism and of pessimism, and both in regard to the home trade and the export trade. For example f in the export trade there were some large exporting firms doing six days a week and others only three or four.    The important thing sae that output in general had gone up last year, but this was due partly to the Ohristmaa orders of whioh the trade had had a fairly good show.    In regard to the export trade there was one pleasant aspect.      Canada had taken 1,000 cwts. more from us, but unfortunately we were losing in the Argentine.On the whole, trade was in a very fair condition.00-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY.SIR THOMAS ALLEN was glad - particularly from the point of view of consumers1  purchasing power - to report that there was an indication of considerable improvement in the Society&apos;s business, and the forthcoming quarterly statement of turnover would show that the trade for the thirteen weeks totalled over eighteen millions sterling, which was an increase of over one million,  or about 5% % on the corresponding period in the previous year.    The supplies received from their productive factories totalled about six and a half million,  showing an increase of about 4^-.    There was also an improvement indicated in the money turnover of the industrials, and an increase in the turnover of money in the Banking Department of something like 8-g$.Sir Thomas could confirm what had been said by Mr. Machin (see paragraph &quot;General Trade&quot;) that morning in respect of the north eastern area.    For a protracted period the Newcastle area had shown a very substantial decrease in purchasing power, amounting to about whilst generally,and in the Manchester and the London areas particularly, a substantial increase had been shown.    Two articles resulted, between them, in an increase of approximately  900,000, namely flour and margarine.     The production of margarine in this country was rapidly enlarging, and if the Dominions could help us more with their butter and cheese, there would be less margarine produced in this country.    This would be helpful, not from the point of view of the productive power of our own country, but from the point of view of the industrials who prefer to eat butter instead of margarine when they can get it at something like comparable prices.
CONFIDENTIAL. SCOTTISH OQ-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY.MR. GALLACHER explained that the Society&apos;s half year ended 26th December and that the figures he would give were for this period.      Their trade for the six months amounted to very close upon  9 millions, a very slight increase - about 2-g- per oent - over the corresponding six month in the previous year.    The grocery increase was 2i per cent.;    in the drapery it was one per cent, and in boots and shoes 2f- per cent.;    in furniture it v/as 3 per cent.    these percentages were rather small and to some extent disappointing, but    were to be accounted for to some extent by the decreased price of certain commodities.    For instates in groceries, in coal, In sugar and all the things into which sugar enters as a raw material, in butter and flour; there had teen a decided decrease in the price during the six months, so that the bulk of the trade would show a better comparison than the prices did.    Yarns had fallen considerably, and the drapery trade had gone up; in heavy goods there had been a considerable fall too, and a large portion of that trade was In ready-mades, whioh of course was a much cheaper class of trade;    in boots too, despite the severe weather we had had, there was a demand for cheaper articles, and instead of buying heavy goods for the snow, people were buying cheap rubber goods.    In furniture they had had during the last six months to begin manufacturing a lighter class of goods because of the smaller houses due to the new housing conditions; bo that all these things conduced to smaller money values.Complaints were general among retail traders In Scotland that they had never had such a bad December for many yeare. At Christmas there was a rush, but it was nothing at all to what it should have been, taking former times as a criterion. It was difficult to see what the outlook was.    Goal dominated the Scottish Industry, and the iron and steel, shipbuilding, . and woollen trades, the staple industries of Scotland, depended upon cheap coal and upon some certainty of cheap ooal over a period.    Everyone in Scotland seemed to be a little bit nervy as to what was going to happen in March when the subsidy came to an end, and until that uncertainty and doubt were dissolved,  it was to be feared that trade was not going to improve.GENERAL TRADE.COL. WILLEY observed that the Federation of British Industries felt the outstanding fact to be the continuous disproportion of activity between sheltered and unsheltered trades.    Dealing with trade as a whole,  there was undoubtedly, as everybody had reported, a better feeling, but it did not seem to be on a very solid basis,  because there was no very pronounced inclination towards forward commitments to an extent that would confirm the expectation of an improvement in existing conditions, - at least beyond the end of the present quarter.    The unsheltered trades mainly concerned in exports were undoubtedly feeling the effect of competition from depreciated exchange countries.
S8GENERAL TRADE (CONTPQ .In Continental trade the best example of activity was Italy where,  taking textiles for instance,  some firms were running two and three shifts and working to their fullest capacity.    In the United States, where purchasing power should be highest,  undoubtedly there was a continued resistance to any attempt to advance prices0    And particularly as regards textiles,  as soon as there was any evidence of advance in price, business appeared to fall off materially.    Generally speaking,  an impression had been formed that the proportion of people&apos;s budgets which was expended on textiles was now materially less than it used to be before the war,  and that this was  just as marked in countries with the highest purchasing power like tho United States,   as it was In the poorer parts of Europe.    All our trades which were dependent on exports were undoubtedly being affected by the low purchasing power of the Continent, not necessarily in direct but more particularly in triangular trade,  and it was hard to feel any confidence in an increase in purchases by those countries which was going to givo much hope of stimulus to our export trade.    The prospect of cheap money, which gave a little fillip to trade in the latter part of last year seemed to have passed away,  and the rapid issue of foreign loans seemed likely soon to absorb our available resources for foreign investment;  and,  though these loans had had little effect in increasing our exports up to now, neverthe-less if these Issues had to be slacked off to avoid any substantial advance In money rates,  those trades In this country dependent upon export would not have very much consolation in future prospects.    The Federation of British Industries had always been in favour of the removal of the embargo, as they had also been in favour of the reversion to the gold standard,  but one could not be blind to our prospects,  and, therefore, the outstanding puzzle, with a decreased purchasing power In the bulk of Europe, was to see where there could be a substantial increase in export trade on present values.The President remarked that,  as against that there was the general feeling of security after Locarno, which should result in a steadily decreasing expenditure on armaments and a greater will among tho nations to set their house in order,  and work.MR. MACHIN was pleased to be able to endorse the opinions that had been expressed by other speakers as to the much moro hopeful outlook that existed to-day than had existed for some time past.    The food and luxury trades appeared to have had a brisk Christmas season,  stook3 were In a healthy state,  arid there was more confidence than had beon the case for a good many years. As far as general trade was concerned,  the chief note of complaint that he had received came from the North Eastern part of the country which largely dependod on shipping and coal,; but from the general body of traders there were indications of a belief that If we could steer clear of any great labour upheaval there was no reason why,  this year, we should not make steady progress in every direction.
SIR F&quot;iLIX SCHUSTER said that the reports from the various branches of the National Provincial Bank appeared to reflect the statements on trade which had been given at the Council. A slight improvement in actual trade from variousquarters had been reported: and, added to that slight improvement In trade, there was  a much more hopeful feeling prevailing almost everywhere.       The actual movement of trade seemed as yet to be not quito so significant of improvement as the feeling that better times were coming.There was, however, a certain anxiety in some quarters that the Bank of England rate might have to be raised again, in consequence largely of Dutch requirements of gold.     Those Dutch requirements had been caused by purely temporary reasons, - large sales of rubber in this market;    they were trying to get rid of their rubber as fast as they could at the present high prices : that had certainly sent the Eastern exchanges against Holland and this was reflected here. Eventually the situation must right itself, b*c*use we exported rubber again to the United States,  and then the effect-on the American exchange would probably more than offset the Dutch exchange position.     There had been a good deal of speculation in the Stock Markets of the United States, which might raise the monetary rates there,  and a   good deal of American money employed here had been withdrawn. The amountsdue to America on Bank balances and so on appeared to have been very largely decreased during the last few months,  and personally Sir Felix was disposed to believe that we had got over the worst of the monetary squeeze.       Unless something quite unforeseen happened, he thought the b% Bank Rate ought to be quite sufficient. With a return to the gold standard we had got back to normal seasonal conditions, and our experience always had been that America and other countries made large demands on our market during November and December, and that in January and February that righted itself and money flowed back from America to London. Although there were no signs evident at the moment,  it was not at all Impossible, particularly as the feeling in America towards European markets was gradually improving, that they were willing to lend more money, and this must come through the London market * Sir F. Schuster was not afraid of the American   exchange situation nor as to our ability to maintain our gold standard without any severe pressure in the money market.       Of course, during the first three months of the year the revenue collections affected the City very much indeed, and money was apt to be scarce, but. although that might be reflected in a certain amount of tightness for the time being, a gradual easing of conditions might be anticipated.     The removal of the embargo had of course led to rather a rush of foreign loans, but the good effect as to improvement In trade, which seemed bound to come with increased exports, would make itself felt eventually.      There were signs cf the probable gradual liquidations of old loans,  and the advances being made today were largely for new trado, although a certain proportion of them were going into concerns which were still not quite through their troubles and were engaged in setting their houses in order.CONFIDENTIAL. GENERAL TRADE    AND   BANKING.
CONFIDENTIAL. GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING (CONTD) .MR. TENNANT said that the reports from the branches cf the Westminster Bank; bore out generally what had been heard at the Cnuncil that morning.     There was a more hopeful feeling in most of the trades, but in regard to the cotton trade the reports were decidedly worse.     There was a considerable improvement as regards output in the coal trade, - which was presumably being carried en at a loss, -and the general position of our Industry appeared to show a distinct improvement *&quot;With regard to our financial position, we had seen about 2-g millions of gold going out of the country during the month, principally to Holland.     Sir Felix Schuster had explained how that had happened in connexion with the Dutch rubber requirements, and it no doubt would right itself.     The returns for the Bankers&apos; Clearing House,  (if they could be held to convey any information as to the state of trade) had reached the record figure of forty thousand million pounds,which represented a considerable increase over last year.     As a matter of fact, however, the Clearing House returns were not Indicative of trade merely, but were largely affected by Stock Exchange movements.      of there was, for example, a rubber boom, that largely inflated the figure. Mr. Tennant thought the returns from the Provincial Clearing Houses were more accurate as a trade index,  and they, cf course, showed an improvement over last year,MR. BRAND agreed generally with the view expressed by Sir -Felix Schuster about money conditions.     We had here an enormous demand from the rest of the world, particularly from the Continent, for capital.     That was supplied to a great extent from America,     But we had to do a good deal ourselves,  and certainly    it was difficult to see why very-high rates for capital throughout the rest of the world should not do something to affect our rate here, -   why we should have a much lower rate than the rest of the world for capital,      It seemed&apos;that the scarcity In the whole world was bound to affect, us.     On the other hand, this&apos; market would doubtless only take absolutely first class issues from abroad, and perhaps the bulk of them, the big ones, would be made in a few months &apos; time.     Nevertheless, Mr. Brand thought the future of the Bank Rate in the next six months was a little uncertain, and it was surely more likely to go up than it was to go down.Mr, Brand desired to endorse a remark Colonel Wllley made,  as to the effect of the Continent of Europe on our trade, He understood it was the case that the Continent took about one-third of our exports.     How in regard to Germany in particular, all indications showed that conditions were extremely bad, their purchasing power very low, their bankruptcies very high.     True, their balance of trade had improved, that is their exports were increasing and their Imports decreasing, but probably the improvement in purchasing power in Germany would be quite slow; and, further, Mr, Brand did not think that when the French had put their position straight we should see them in a very prosperous or happy mood.     Therefore he believed that we   -
CONFIDENTIAL.     % 7 IGENERAL TRADE AND BANKING (CONTD.) .had got to faoo in the next year or so a bad customer in Europe, which would do something to offset our good customers In other parts of the world.SHIPPING.SIP. ALAN ANDERSON pointed out that thoro was very little change in the tramp shipping position, which was still bad. The November index of freights was 26/o of 1930, whereas in November 1924,  it was 29fo,    The figure for last November was a little better than for the previous month, but still it was a very bad one.    Laid up tonnage was considerably greater at the beginning of October than it had been at the same time In the previous year - 574,000 tons for tho principal ports of the United Kingdom, as against 333,000 in the year before.    Last October&apos;s figure was, again, a decrease since the worst point in the summer, but it was bad. As regards tonnage under construction, it was very noticeable every time how extraordinarily well we kept up our proportion of the world&apos;s total in spite of the despondency here.    We had, of course, vory much enlarged our shipbuilding capacity in this country.    For the quarter ending September of last year, we were doing 45fe of the whole world&apos;s total -1,009,000 tons against 1,197,000.    That was rather remarkable.    There was a serious drop in the orders placed at the end of last year, but apart from that we had been running just about level with the rest of the world, apparently.    The tonnage launched in the last four quartors, ending September,  in the United Kingdom was 1,215,000, and in the rest of the world 1,007,000; we therefore had over the half of the total, whoroas the tonnage commenced was  jU3t under the half.It had several times been suggostod that the method of helping tho shipbuilding industry by giving them State encouragoment to build ships is a double-edged weapon.    The Chamber of Shipping of course included amongst its members some of the owners who had got these grants, and therefore It did not speak absolutely with an undivided voioe, but it had passed resolutions viewing with grave doubt and suspicion the application of these trade facilities to increasing what was thought to be the real disease in shipping namely that there were too many ships just now. Another objection to the intervention of Government In this matter was that it was misinterpreted all over the world, and looked upon as a bonus to British shipping, which was really very unfair.    In America, for example, the help which the British Government were giving to shipbuilding here was regarded as a direct attompt by them to bolster up British shipping, and the fact was overlooked that this help was going very largely to foreign owners who have placed their orders hero.    It had been reported that the suggestion of having preferential rates on the American railways for goods to be carried in American ships was again to come up before Congress, That report had not been confirmed, but any impression in tho minds of people abroad that our Government was taking a part in the British shipping industry would probably lead to the suggestion of countervailing measures.
OOHPIPSNTIAL.RAILWAYS TRAFFIC,disclosure HSR33RT WALKER   observed that so far as one could judge   -from returns of railway receipts and tonnages, althcug trade was still in a very bad way, tho last thirteen weeks of the year showed a distinct improvement as compared with the first nine months.    While there was a very big decrease in the carriage of ironstone and of iron ore,  there were certainly signs of improvement in traffic in the steel tradd The carriage of building and road making materials was still very heavy - heavier perhaps than it had ever beenB    So far as we could tell at present, wool and cotton did not show any signs of improvement at all.Although coal, and especially coal for export, was still vex^y bad,  the general merchandise traffic was distinctly on the up move,  and receipts all indicated, that whereas we wore still losing very heavily on coal, wo wore picking up considerably in regard to general merchandise.MR. BROOKE said that the railway figures were a little better towards the end of the year/   The total published traffic receipts for 1925 showod a decrease of 3J?- millions, or 2)a, on the previous year.    The latest detailed figures, which were for last October, looked very bad, because the general merchandise figure was so much down as compared with October 1924, but that was accounted for by the fact that October 1924 was a boom monthj and if one compared the figures for October 1925 (excluding coal) with, for instance, those for October 1923,  thoy proved not to be so bad.UNEMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS said that in the first three weeks of Docembor there had been a drop of 63,000 in the unemployment figures.    Then,   just before Christmas,  there was an increase of 36,000, and,  probably, as in past years,  this would be followod by a further inoroa,so after Christmas.    There was no need, howover, to think that any suoh increase would be other than temporary.    It was known that the 36,000 in the pre-Christmas period consisted of persons temporarily on short time.    The Ministry of Labour   had recent],y made arrangements for dividing tho numbers of unemployed into three groups - wholly unemployed,  temporarily., and casuals; and. it was hoped soon?  if no unforeseen difficulties arose, to begin publishing figures under those categoriesa    It might interest the Council to know that out of the 1,102,000 unemployed on December 21st,  the numbers temporarily stopped represented a proportion of I7)r .Mr.   -Judson suggested that the unemployment figures-would be largely Increased if it were not for the fact that a considerable number of unemployed had been struck off in connection with the extended benofit, and as the result of that refusal,  they declined to go to the Exchange now.
CONFIDENTIAL. UNEMPLOYMENT (CQNTINU3D).Mr. Fhillips    did not think however, that the reductions which had taken place during the past few months were accounted for to any considerable extent by that cause.    In fact tho total number struck off owing to the new administrative rules had not been very large in comparison with the total reduction and there was another noticeable factor in that the number of people remaining on the registers,  although they were not drawing benefit, had shown a fairly considerable increase. The Ministry had no figures to show whether any individual person whose benefit was disallowed remained on the register or not;   but the margin between the total number who they knew were drawing benefit and the total number on the register was continuously Increasing.    Of course some reduction of the total unemployment figures had been caused since last September by the increased number of disallowances, but it was a small and not a large one,AUSTRALIAN TRADE,MR, SANDERSON said that the pastoral areas in Australia were rather suffering from want of rain. In the agricultural areas the harvesting was in progress and the yield proved rather better than had been expected.As to the overseas trade of Australia for 1924/25, the &apos; . total imports from British countries amounted in value to  91,000,000 and the total exports to  85,000,000;    as to trade with foreign countries the totals were as follows:-imports into Australia from foreign countries,  66,000,000, exports from Australia to foreign countries,  76,000,000,    The proportion of imports supplied by the United Kingdom was 43.9.^ in 1924/5 against 45,2$ in the previous year,With regard to butter supplies, which at this time of the year were important, the Queensland and New South Wales supply was Increasing,  and it was contemplated they would more than compensate for the reduction in the other States. The Australian Meat Council had reported favourable weather conditions during the past month, but owing to the shipping strike and the larger supplies in Great Britain of home killed meat,  the values were being adversely affected and meat stocks had been allowed to accumulate. Supplies were now being sent forward although it was expected that they would meet a comparatIvely depressed market.The President observed that, as regards imports into Great Britain and Northern Ireland, whereas in 19^.3 less than 25$ were coming from within the Empire,  the latest figures showed that over 29% were coming from w ithin t he Empire and the advance   had recently been specially pronounced. A year ago it stood at about 27%, whilst in the past twelve months it was over the 29%,
NSW ZEALAND TRADE.SIR JAMES ALLEN remarked that Sir Thomas Allen had invited the Dominions,   and New Zealand in particular,  to assist in supplying \nore cheese and butter to this country, in competition with margarine, (See paragraph headed &quot;Co-operative Wholesale Society&quot;),    New Zealand could only do that by increasing Its population, by migration;    it had got to the stage at which the ten thousand limit fixed some   time ago had now been reached,,  and Sir James thought his Government were considering whether it was possible to increase the number.The outlook for butter and cheese was quite satisfactory and it was stated that the sales of cheese already made would make a good supply for the early part of the season. They would be a little late in shipping their butter,  and for the first three months it was estimated that the production would be h%&quot;below last year&apos;s.    It was expected that 400,000    cases of fruit would be exported as against 230,000 last year. The   New Zealand Government were in the market for about If million pounds worth of machinery for workshops - mostly railway repair shops, -and tenders had been received from United Kingdom manufacturers and others. The New Zealand high-power electrical work was going steadily forward.INDIAN TRADE.MR, LINDSAY said that with regard to lndia&apos;s import trade as a whole, the British share still  continued lower than it was before the war, but that was due very largely to the fact that India&apos;s purchases from all sources of the highly manufactured goods in which the British manufacturer specialised were smaller than pre-war.   That point was endorsed by the British Trade Commissioner in India in his last report on Indian Trade. Taking, however,  as a separate group the highly manufactured goods which India imported very largely from this country, and In which this country specialised, and excluding the imports in which British manufacturers did not compete, Mr. Ai-nscough said that the British share before the war had been 75 per cent, and was still 75 per cent.    Although ,details of the calculation had not been published, Mr. Ainscough had no doubt   included cotton textiles in this group and those certainly showed a decline.    The British share of the cotton textile imports was now 82 per cent,  as against 95 per cent, before the war, Now,  -. both Bombay and Lancashire realised that their joint enemy in this matter was Japan.  It was kno.vn that the Japanese share of trade had gone up proportionately to the loss of British trade in the cotton textiles. in this connection a question which was interesting the Government of India just now was what action Mr. Wadia, the Chairman of the Bombay Mill-Owners&apos; Association,would take on his return to India. The cotton excise duty hid been removed, but Mr. Wadia held that this was not sufficient    of itself to place the 3ombay industry on its feet again, and it is quite likely that he would ask for some
CONFIDENTIAL.INDIAN TRADE. (CONTD. )sort of discriminating action against Japan.    It would be extremely difficult for the Government of India to put forward any legislation of that sort.    They were bound by the commercial Convention with Japan which involved most-favoured-nation treatment.    They could not very well denounce that Convention because the possibility of retaliatory action by Japan was serious.    Japan afforded an excellent market for Indian pig iron and they could hit India back in many ways. Not only that, but it was understood that a resolution put before the Associated Chambers of Commerce of all India at their last meeting in Calcutta to the effect that the Govern-ment should denounce this commercial Convention with Japan,was lost.    In answer to the President, Mr. Lindsay agreed that there was nothing in that convention which would prevent the India Government from raising the duties against all foreign countries, and maintaining them at their present level against the rest of the Empire.    Again, it was quite likely that Mr, Wadia might ask for an examination by the Tariff Board, which would correspond roughly to an enquiry by a committee appointed by the Board of Trade here, with a view to the safeguarding of the Bombay industry, but there again there would be some difficulties.    Much of the success of the Japanese in the Indian market was due to their higher efficiency, and also to the fact that they had written down their capital on the strength of very high profits made after the w ar.with regard to stocks of piece goods in India, these stocks were now held at the warehouses at the ports, and practically no stocks were held up-country.    Even the stocks at the ports were light so far as imported goods were con-cerned.    With regard to raw cotton, Mr. Lindsay had been in Manchester the previous day,  and found that  the demand for Indian cotton was falling off in Lancashire, due of course to the increase of American supplies.    However, the margin between Indian cotton of the best type which was ihd. off middling American before the war,  and a month ago was a half-penny off,  is now back at Id.  off, so that it looked as if with lower prices India may get a footing again in Lancashire.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR.  HOSE wrote:-&quot;The announcement h^s been made that the B^nco Central de Chile will open for business on 11th instant.    It will be recalled that the Banco Central de Chile Is the new bank authorised to be established under Chilean Government Decree of 22nd August, 1925, and which, as its name implies, will act as a central banking institution in the Republic.    Among Its functions will be the sole right of emission of the new national currency, b^sed on the peso of a par value of 6d.  which,  as a matter of fact, has been about the actual value of the peso in the international exchange market for some considerable time past.    Presumably,  the date of adoption of the new monetary unit will synchronise with the opening of the Bank.
-76CONFIDENTIAL. SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.(Contd.J&quot;In my last report to the Council, I mentioned that a considerable degree of monetary stringency was likely to ensue in connection with  the new banking legislation.    In fact, the conservation of   funds by the banks for the purpose of comply-ing with the new regulations has already brought about a short-age of currency and restriction of credit.    Prompt steps have, however, been taken by the Government to alleviate the situation, a Decree Law having been issued on 1st December last whereby, pending the commencement of operations by the new bank of issue, currency notes could be delivered to the banks in exchange for gold deposits abroad at the rate of $39.25 per   sterling, as well as against gold deposits in Santiago at the par rate of 40.    The native bank, to whose difficulties I referred a month ago, suspended operations on 1st December last to permit the inspection of its position by the Superintendent of Banks, under the new banking law,.&quot;The present position in regard to the national finances of Chile is obscure.    It was known some little time ago that the position was then not so encouraging as had been officially reported at the commencement of 1925, and apprehensions in this respect were confirmed by recent cable advices stating that the Budget deficit will be increased during 1926 by $300,000,000 (paper), to a total of $450,000,000 (paper).    We are still awaiting to receive by mail details as to the accumulation of this deficit, but the authorities hope to offset this adverse balance in the Budget to the extent of /100,000,000 (paper) by means of strict economy in administration, whilst the situation should be further ameliorated by receipts from the sale of Government nitrate grounds, due to take place on 30th April next.&quot;The complete returns of Chilean foreign trade for the first nine months of 19 25 have not yet been published, but official statistics relative thereto indicate that the Increased Import and export movement recorded in the early months, of the year have been maintained, notwithstanding the unsettled political conditions.    The aggregate value of 35 principal articles of importation in the period was $92,131,000 (gold of 18d.), as compared with $76,500,000 in the first nine months of 1924, while 28 principal articles of exportation were valued at $415,000,000 against $393,400,000.&quot;Increased consumption was experienced during 1925 in the all-important nitrate industry in Chile, despite competition resulting from the heavier output of synthetic nitrogenous fertilisers.    Chilean nitrate producers are making successful efforts to reduce the cost of production,  and,  as further expansion is anticipated in world consumption, prosperity In the industry should continue.    In general, the outlook is favour-able for further expansion in Chilean foreign trade in 1926, more especially in view of the satisfactory position of the wool, nitrate, and mining industries, and the possibility of stability In exchange resulting from the inauguration of the Banco Central and the establishment of the new parity rate.
0 0 M FID EH TlA L * SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (Contd.).In Argentina,, the textile trade is experiencing&apos; the increased aotlvity usual during the Summer season, and results so far have been encouraging.     A marked improvement is observable in the market for British textiles, notably for ,Manchester goods.     Indications are not laoking, however, of over-trading in some directions.     The demand for imported woollen goods is also improving, and foreign competition becoming less severe.     The depreciation in the exchange values of the currencies of Belgium, France,  and Italy has militated against the purohase of high-quality wool, and prices of their manufactures have consequently been advanoed.     In some instances,^ Continental dealers are quoting prices In sterling or United States dollars.   A slight improvement is recorded in the sale of yarns, and the hardware market is active,-&quot;In general,  commercial payments in Argentina are being met fairly satisfactorily, but,  owing to continued failures,  most British dealers are willing to do business only with old and well-known ollents.   In this connection,  the liabilities in trade failures in the first eleven months of 1925 amounted to  114,830,083 (paper), as compared with only ^85,407,378 in the corresponding period of 1924.Latest advices regarding prospects for the Argentine cereal crops show that the damage caused by &quot;black rust&quot;, although at first undoubtedly exaggerated, has been considerable in various distriots In the Provinces of Cordoba and Santa F5.     Heavy rain has fallen, and has retarded the harvest.   The rain has, however, been very beneficial to the growing maize, which is everywhere In excellent condition, and there oan be no doubt that, apart from wheat,  the yields of other grain crops will be substantially in exoess of those realised last year,&quot;Peruvian trade conditions have reoently been unsatisfactory, and the country appears to have not yet reoovered from the severe setback which resulted from the floods and the consequent destruction of crops in the Spring of 1925,    Credit stringency is reported, and importers make numerous requests for the extension of payments,  which,  in most cases, are being granted. Exchange has weakened somewhat,  the tendenoy being,  therefore, towards the reduotion of profits in the import trade, as prices oannot be raised without causing a material decrease in consumption,     Import orders have therefore been reduced to a minimum for the time being.     The expenses involved in the Arioa-Taona plebiscite are a drain upon Government resources in Peru as well as Chile, whilst the deadlook whloh appears to have been reached in this matter is a cause of anxiety to all having interests in those countries,&quot;With regard to Brazll.  the chief event to note is the flotation on behalf of the Sao Paulo Coffee Institute of a loan of  4,000,000 in London,  as well as of a further amount of  1,000,000 in Holland and Switzerland,    The Sao Paulo producers of coffee, the chief export commodity of Brazil, will no   doubt benefit considerably by the funds thus made available for the support of their industry, while the fact that this loan was granted in London after having been discouraged in New York should exercise beneficial influence upon the trading relations between Brazil and this country,&quot;
TRADE IN CHINA.Mr. IANDALE remarked that any inorease in Chinese Customs revenue would be found not to result from trade with this country.     As to imports,  the latest report from China stated that there was praotioally nothing being done in Manchester pieoegoods,  and that the local Mills were fairly busy.     In exports from China,  there was only a very small business in general produce.      Continental markets were very depressed, and Germany did not appear to be able to buy.     In silk there was a good business being transacted at advancing prices.No progress had been made in adjusting the difficulties between Hongkong and Canton,    The Committee of Chinese who were sent from Hongkong to negotiate a settlement in Canton had returned without accomplishing anything.     Latest written advioes from Hongkong were, however, hopeful that a settlement would soon be reached.   The Russians in Canton were the chief obstacle.The Ministry of Communications, Peking, was now in the position of having no control whatsoever over any railway   in China, and the Minister, Yeh Kung Oho,  one of the few men in China who had any understanding of the railway position vis-a-vis foreign obligations,  had resigned from the post.The Peking Mukden Railway was dominated by the military tunchun Feng at one end and by Chang Tso Lin at the other, and its service was mainly run for the transport of troops and military supplies which would not be paid for in cash.     The Japanese had protected their   railway in South Manchuria,  and there was a marked difference in the condition of the two lines,     The Peking Hankow and Tientsin Pukow lines were being controlled in Provincial sections by any military commander who happened to be in the neighbourhood.     In the cessation of hostilities round Shanghai,   tho two local railways were recuperating, but were badly in need of repairs and additional rolling stock,   &quot;The. Canton Kowloon Railway was not in a position to pay even its staff wages and was physically and financially in a deplorable condition.
