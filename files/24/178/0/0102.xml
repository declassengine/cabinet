MOST SECRET.545CP. 91 (26).CABINET.DEVELOPMENT OF TRADE UNIONISM IN THE CIVILSERVICE.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I THINK it desirable to circulate to my colleagues a memorandum which has been prepared in the Treasury on the subject of the develop-ment of trade unionism in the Civil Service.Treasury Chambers,March 2, 1296.The Development of Trade Unionism in the Civil Service.For many years past, and to an increasing degree in recent years, the rank and file of the Civil Service have been organising themselves on trade union lines. Most of the workmen in Government industrial establishments are members of one or other industrial trade union. The manipulative workers in the Post Office have their own Union of Postal Workers. On the clerical side of the Civil Service a large number of Associations have come into being. The Civil Service Clerical Association alone is reputed to have a membership of 20,000.Many of these Associations are run by men who are not Civil Servants. This practice dates from 20 years ago when the Postmaster-General agreed to receive representations from the members of an Association through its secretary, whether he were a member of the Service or not.   Since that time there has been an increasing tendencyw. s. c.[14268]
for Associations of Civil Servants. to employ as their secretary and representative in chief whole-time officials of their own., Two results have followed. In the first place, if only because these whole-time officials must justify their salaries, pressure to obtain better and still, better conditions of service has tended to become more and more persistent. By their -speeches and by their writings in the numerous Civil Service journals that are nowadays in circulation, leaders of Civil Service Associations do their utmost to prevent their con-stituents from resting content with things as they are and to inflame them with a desire for things that they have not got. It is noticeable, and natural enough, that the tendency to attack becomes more pronounced at times when Associations of Civil Servants fear that their existing conditions of service are in jeopardy.A further important consequence of the development of trade unionism in the Civil Service is the tendency towards affiliation with the Trade Union Congress and the Labour Party. Several Civil Service Associations, including the Union of Post Office Workers and the Civil Service Clerical Association, are affiliated to either or both of these bodies. In a number of cases their funds have been used to promote the candidature for Parliament of their own nominees. Officials of these Associations attend and take an active part at meetings of the Trade Union Congress and the Labour Party.No. one watching the march of events could say that the present situation was satisfactory or free from danger. The practice of employing whole-time officials who are not Civil Servants is wrong; and it is deplorable that Associations of Civil Servants should become attached to any political party. But whilst it is easy enough to criticise the present state of things, it is much less easy to find a remedy that would not be more dangerous than the disease. No one at this time of day would think of denying to Civil Servants the right to organise themselves in Associations for the protection and furtherance of their own interests: and it is no doubt better that they should form Associations of their own, even though staffed by persons who are not themselves Civil Servants and affiliated to a particular political party, than that they should join general labour unions. It is not the habit in this country to put clocks back, and however undesirable the present state of things may be, it could hardly be radically altered at this time; it would indeed seem impracticable to do more that insist on strict observance of the existing rule forbidding individual Civil Servants to take any active part in politics.Whatever else may be said about the growth of trade unionism in the Civil Service, it cannot be said that it has so far led to any general feeling among Civil Servants in favour of the &quot; strike weapon.&quot; It may be confidently asserted that Civil Servants in general are absolutely set against strikes in the Civil Service.   Strike funds do not exist: indeed,
when the executive of the Uuion of Postal Workers proposed to start a 546 strike fund a few years ago, the scheme was rejected by an overwhelming majority of the rank and file. In the established Civil Service strikes have hardly ever occurred. There was a strike of 450 London postmen in 1890: two established moulders joined the Moulders&apos; strike in 19t20: and there was a strike, also in 1920, of postal officials in Ireland, many of whom no doubt joined in because they were afraid of being murdered if they refused to do so.It is not so certain, however, that extremists who are out to cause trouble will not sooner or later be making serious attempts to develop a strike policy for the Civil Service. According to a recent article by the Labour Correspondent of the &quot; Westminster Gazette,&quot; Mi-. W. J. Brown, the Secretary of the Civil Service Clerical Association, is said to be negotiating an alliance -with the Industrial Unions, the effect of which would be that &quot; the members of the Civil Service Clerical Association would come under the sway of a small body which could call on them to cease work in support of the miners, transport workers, engineers or shipbuilders.&quot; In view of possible developments in the near future, it may be expedient to take an early opportunity (possibly by way of reply to a question in Parliament) of making clear to all concerned the incom-patibility of a strike policy with the position held by Civil Servants as employees of the Crown.The question of the right to strike was raised in 1920 by the trade union side of the Shipbuilding Trades Joint Council; and, under directions from the Cabinet, the following statement was made to the Council by the official side : &quot; There is no statutory prohibition of strikes by Civil Servants. Such a prohibition has not hitherto been found necessary, for Civil Servants have recognised that the fact that they are Servants of the State and the conditions of establishment with pension on retire-ment, impose special obligations upon them and differentiate their case from that of the employees of any private trader for profit.&quot; But the principle upon which Parliament has proceeded in giving legal sanction to the award of pensions to Civil Servants is that they should have rendered faithful and satisfactory service, and this primary condition cannot be held to have been satisfied in the case of servants of the State who by striking have endangered or prevented the carrying on of the public service for which Government is responsible to Parliament and the community.&quot;If any public declaration is now to be made, it might well follow the lines of this statement.
