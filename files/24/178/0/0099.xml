SECRET.p    f^f^lff     ^hfkir%     W JET N9*   30CP. 98 (26).CABINET.DIVERSION OF CREDIT BETTING.Note by the Chanceelob oe the Exohequeb.I CIRCULATE herewith a Memorandum by the Board of Customs and Excise on the subject of the suggestion made by the Home Secretary in OP. 73 (26) that the limited scheme for a Betting Duty which is now under consideration would result in. the diversion of credit betting to foreign countries.w. s. c.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, March 29, 1926.1. The Home Secretary suggests that the limited scheme for a betting duty which is now under consideration would result in diverting much of the credit betting to Holland where a bookmaker, being free from the proposed tax, would be able to give longer odds.2. This possibility of diversion of credit betting is not peculiar to the limited scheme, but would equally arise under the larger scheme which was examined by the Select Committee of the House of Commons. It is not, therefore, a new problem. Not only so, but Holland or other foreign countries are not the only places to which credit betting might be diverted there are more convenient places nearer home in which credit bookmakers might carry on tax-free operations, viz., the Isle of Man, Channel Islands and the Irish Free State. Northern Ireland is also a possibility as a betting duty could not be imposed on Northern Ireland by the Imperial Parliament having regard to the terms of Section 21 (1) of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.3. The fact is that avoidance of a betting duty by the transference of credit operations to a locality in which the duty does not run, is a possibility under any scheme of betting taxation. The questions for enquiry are the extent to which such avoidance is possible or likely and the practicability of restrictive measures.Is Diversion Possible or Likely f4. Rate of tax would clearly be the primary consideration in determining the answer to this question. It is clear that the greater the tax, the greater the tendency would be to avoid it. Tax-free operations with a 2\ per cent, tax would mean a margin to the bookmaker of Qd. in the  1, and similar operations under a 5 per cent, tax would give a margin of Is. in the  1 on all bets received over and above the margin of profit made by the bookmaker subject to tax. Either of these margins is substantial, having regard to the small rate of profit on turnover which is made by credit bookmakers in general, and prima facie it would seem therefore that there would be considerable inducement to credit bookmakers to transfer their offices from a taxed Great Britain to an untaxed Isle of Man, Irish Free Stats, Northern Ireland, Holland or elsewhere, and that this inducement would increase as the rate of tax increased.5.   But there are considerations which must be off-set against this tendency.   In the first place, it must be borne in mind that credit betting is for the most part transacted on a starting price basis the evidence before the Select Committee was that 90 per cent, of betting was of this kind and starting prices under a betting tax [14293]
would reflect the tax in reduced odds. The local Belfast or Dublin bookmaker would, probably give starting price odds on British events in order to pocket the extra profit arising from his tax-free operations. But if so, there would be no more inducement than at present for persons in Great Britain to bet at starting prices with them rather than with bookmakers in this country. It follows on similar reasoning that there would be no inducement for starting price bookmakers in this country to move abroad unless they were able to invent some scheme which would enable them to share with the British backer the advantage of freedom from duty.6. Regard must also be had to the additional expense which would be incurred by the credit bookmaker in Holland or elsewhere in order to attract custom from Great Britain. Extensive advertising by means of newspapers and circulars would be necessary if he were to secure any substantial portion of the existing credit bookmaking business and this would eat into his profits. It is believed that certain bookmakers in Dublin do at present carry on some credit business with this country, but the bookmakers who formerly advertised from Dutch addresses usually carried on a business of cash with order, and bookmakers moving the seat of their business abroad might adopt the same rule for their own safety.7. It is certainly true that a credit bookmaker setting up business abroad would, by reason of his tax-free operations, be in a position to offer longer odds for ante-post betting, but in relation to the aggregate amount of betting ante-post betting with credit bookmakers is believed to be small.8. The possibility of diversion must also be viewed from the standpoint of the person making the bet. Firstly, he would feel less secure in making bets with book-makers in another country and in a less accessible place, though this reluctance would be lessened if the foreign business were a branch of a reputable firm in this country. Secondly, the bet telephoned just before a race would be practically impossible. Generally there would be extra difficulty and expense in telephoning bets, though there would be not much more trouble and cost in wiring or writing bets. These considerations should result cumulatively in a distinct reluctance on the part of backers in this country to place bets with bookmakers abroad. On the other hand, there can be no guarantee that bookmakers overseas would find themselves unable to invent some form of bonus for backers which would overcome that reluctance in part.9. We feel therefore that, whilst it is easy to exaggerate the attractions to the British bookmaker and backer of conducting betting operations abroad, some diversion of this kind is possible. In any case it will probably be attempted in the first instance.Possible Restrictive Measures.10. Whether restrictive measures should be imposed in the first instance must clearly depend on the extent to which diversion is considered likely to occur, a question on which no firm opinion can now be expressed. But the bookmaker is an ingenious person and consideration must be given to the possible means of preventing avoidance in this way. What precisely those means should be would require detailed discussions between the Home Office, Post Office and the Customs and our suggestions are therefore given under all reserve.11. The first step would presumably be to render it illegal for any person in this country to place bets on British events with persons outside Great Britain. It would then be necessary to take such action as might be possible to detect and suppress illegal betting of this kind. In this connection it would be necessary to prohibit all advertisements in. this country of foreign bookmakers whether by newspaper or circular. But it would presumably not be possible to prevent the introduction into Great Britain of overseas newspapers which might contain betting advertisements relating to British events.12. Credit bets are laid by telephone, by telegram or by letter. In regard to each of these means of conveyance the Post Office is the authority and accordingly their advice has been sought.   A copy of their letter is annexed.13. So far as the telephone is concerned, it is clear that there are no means of restricting its use in this connection. But, as already pointed out, there are obvious difficulties in the use of the telephone for the purpose of placing bets abroad and in any case the backer would always have other, more convenient, means at band, viz., telegram or letter. It may be noted that the credit bookmaker will accept a bet which is postmarked before the time of the race.14 Telegrams and letters are more serious. The Post Office do not seem to contemplate much practical difficulty in holding up telegrams and letters addressed to
bookmakers outside this country, provided that they are supplied with names and addresses. They were not examined on this precise point before the Select Committee, hut they were asked their opinion on the possibility of action on these lines in regard to internal illegal betting. On this they were not hopeful, pointing out the many difficulties that must arise in identifying betting communications. We cannot help feeling that the Post Office are now rather too optimistic.15. But Post Office action would depend entirely, as they indicate, upon information supplied to them by this Department. How far we should be successful in obtaining it is a matter of conjecture.- We should be dependent upon information given to us by trade rivals in this country and upon such indications that came into our hands in the way of advertisements and circulars,16. The precise manner in which the Post Office should receive power to act in a particular case e.g., by Home Office warrant or otherwise would require further consideration.17. Our conclusion is that, although without any restrictive action forces would be at work to minimise the extent of diversion and successful safeguards might be difficult to devise, it would be desirable on the whole to prohibit the placing of bets on British events with persons outside Great Britain and to take powers to implement the prohibition. We feel that the existence of the prohibition with the accompanying powers would in itself be a considerable deterrent.Copy of Letter from the Secretary, General Post Office, to the Chairman, Board of customs and Excise.General Post Office, London, My dear Hamilton, February 23, 1926.Re Belting.I ASSUME that in the contingency to which you refer the Post Office would be supplied either by the Customs or by the Home Office with the names and addresses of the bookmakers on the Continent or in Ireland whose correspondence was to be controlled, and that proper authority, such as the Home Secretary&apos;s warrant, for holding it up would be forthcoming. You want to know whether the Post Office in these circumstances could effectively stop letters and telegrams directed to those addresses.As regards the Continent, most of the mails are made up in London and there would be little difficulty ; as regards the Free State and Northern Ireland, the outlets are more numerous and the mails would have to be searched at a greater number of offices. But in either case I do not think we should have any difficulty in imposing, and maintaining, an effective check ; if the list was a formidable one it might become rather an embarrassing operation, but if it were kept within reasonable limits, it could be worked quite easily.The same applies as regards telegrams; but the importance of keeping the &quot; barred &quot; list small is perhaps of more importance. The Marconi Company conduct a wireless service to Paris and Switzerland, and presumably they would have to be brougnt into line.It must, however, be expected that Continental and Irish bookmakers would start a system of &quot; cover &quot; addresses either in England or abroad, or both. As soon as these addresses become known they could be added to the list, and we could stop the correspondence without any trouble. They could not resort to advertising without attracting attention, and I imagine they could not get any extensive business without it.It would still be possible to pass on the bets by telephone to any of the neighbouring Continental countries or to Ireland. The cost would be considerable for individual bets, but the telephone might conceivably be used by intermediaries here for passing on a number of bets collected in this country. I doubt if it would be practicable to stop or control them, but it would probably be more or less insignificant.Yours sincerely, (Signed) G. E. P. MURRAY.Sir Horace P. Hamilton, .K.C.B.
