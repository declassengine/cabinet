rCONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY.Its DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY&apos;0F HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT).SECRET -\ACP.50(26) Copy Wo.G A B I W B T.POSITION AMD POWERS OP BOARDS OF 0-UARDIAKrS Bill. ^MORAimXJM BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.I find It necessary to draw the attention of lay colleagues to certain questions in connection with the Poor Law, which appear to me to call for early legislation.     In a certain number of Poor Law Unions the Guardians have adopted a definite policy of transforming Poor Law administration Into a system of providing maintenance In lieu of work.    This system seams to have begun with Poplar.     It has spread to other Unions and shows some tendency to increase.     It has been adopted almost explicitly by West Ham, some half dozen Unions in London, a number of Unions in the county of Durham and in part of the South Wales ooal mining area.The characteristics of the administration in these Unions are -(a) the recognition by the Guardians of a fixed and, usually,high scale of relief, frequently with an arrangement to limit the consideration given to the earnings etc of members of the family relieved.(b) the almost automatic grant in every case of relief atthe maximum amount permissible by the scale.(c) in some cases the granting of clearly Illegal relief,notably in the case of relief to persons concerned in a trade dispute.The results of this policy are shown in the great Inflationof the numbers of paupers, and very large increase in rate expend1-ture.     Such expenditure hears especially hardly on trading under-takings whose difficulties are already frequently vary great.*- 1 -
?.R9It Is quite clear that the adoption and execution of this policy has been greatly facilitated by the - &apos;. disappearance in 1918 of the disqualification of persons in receipt of relief from voting at the election of Guardians. In areas affected by this policy practically the only issue of the Guardians elections is the amount of relief which a candidate would be willing to support.     It is not necessary to labour the abuses which can- and do arise from this state of things.Such control as exists at present over the administration of Guardians determined to carry out this policy is limited and unsatisfactoryaShe accounts of the Guardians are subject to audit by the District Auditors, and improper and illegal expenditure may be made the subject of surcharge.In a few instances ratepayers have sought to restrain the Guardians from incurring illegal expenditure by Injunction.In a number of Unions the expenditure of the Guardians is on a scale much higher than can be financed out of local rates, and in some cases the Guardians are only able to carry on by borrowing from Government fund.s. In such cases an effort has been made to secure reduction of expenditure and improved administration by making advances conditional on the adoption of recommendations made by the Goschen Committee.Similar action has been taken in connection with applications for sanction to borrowing by the Guardians from outside sources, though my position In such cases is nou. so strong as where the Guardians are drawing on Government funds.Proceedings -by surcharge or In j-, men ion are useless. In these cases the stu-ch^rgw of largo sums of money on persons who cannot possibly pay is not a deterrent and
Imprisonment only has the effect of making martyrs..While a certain amount of improvement has been secured by pressure applied in connection with loan applications, there is always the risk that a Board of Guardians will refuse to function and leave the Government with the responsibility for the stoppage of necessary relief in the area.     My colleagues will remember that last autumn I had to take steps in connection with  .West Ham which Involved the risk of having to make arrangements, with no statutory powers behind me, for assaying on relief on the Guardians declining to carry out their duties.   This is a situation which may easily arise again at short notice, and I require to be empowered by law to deal with it.There is a further abuse, of which a number of examples have come to notice, which arises from officers of Boards of Guardians, such as Believing; Officers, becoming members or candidates for election as members of other local authorities in the same area,     I think that Instances of this abuse are sufficiently numerous to warrant dealing with the matter by legislation,I propose, therefore., that legislation should be undertaken providing -(1)   for the disqualification of persons who havereceived Poor Law relief,(other than medical relief) from voting at elections of Guardians. (2)   that where on application by the Minister or any ratepayer to the H?sh Court an injunction is granted restraining a Board of Guardians from Illegal expenditure and the members of the authority or any of them fail to obey the order of the Court, the Court without prejudice to any other action it may consider necessary shall disqualify the
disobedient members from service on the Board. (3)     that the Minister of Health may appoint persons to carry on the work of the Guardians who have refused or failed to perform their duties. (4)     that an officer of a Board of Guardians should be prohibited from-being or becoming a member of any other local authority in the same area, and an officer of any other local body in the area be prohibited from becoming a Guardian. I should propose on the other hand to take the opportunity of dealing with the disqualification from membership of Boards of Guardians and Urban and Rural District Councils which results from the acceptance of medical institutional relief by removing the disqualification where the Cost of relief has been repaid.     This is a minor amendment of the law which is supported by members of all parties.I think the most important of these proposals is the first, as being more likely to influence the policy of Guardians than any other.     It will be observed that I am proposing to limit the disqualification to elections for Guardians.     *Shere is possibly some case, though it is not so dear, for extending the disqualification to Local Government electionsj an extension to Parliamentary elections might be suggested but it appears to me to be one whioh it would be Very difficult to maintain.     By limiting the proposal to the case of Guardians&apos; elections for which an overwhelming case can be made out, I think we shall secure a very large body of public support.    I may say that this proposal Is very strongly supported by the London Municipal Society who have abundant evidence of the effect of the present state of things on the elections for London Guardians.
I think It is very desirable to provide some means &quot;of disqualifying members of Boards of Guardians who persist in illegal courses.     It is hardly possible to put this power into the hands of a Minister who would thus be called upon to penalise his political opponents.     It is, however, a power which might most usefully be glveh to the Courts, and I anticipate that the existence of such a power would make rate-payers more willing to attack their Boards of Guardians who were guilty of flagrantly illegal expenditure.The principle of legislation to supersede Boards of Guardians who refuse to function was accepted by the Government of 1923 and seeias to me to be an essential part of any proposals for dealing with the present situation.The conflict between interest and duty which may arise where a person is an officer of one local authority and member of another in the same area is so clear as amply to justify my proposal on this point.The proposals which I have indicated are, I think, the minimum which should be adopted and the abuses which have grown up are so great and the difficulties which arise are so serious that I am satisfied that the Government should take action without delay.I should be glad to have a decision of the Cabinet 01 the above questions so that a draft bill can be prepared for circulation to the Home Affairs Committee.N.G.
