CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,3-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP BIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT) .IH.DUSTRIAL ASSURANCE fJOyEMIULSOGIBTIESj; BILL. Memorandum by tho ffinKnoial Secretary jto^jtlie Treasury -1. Section 11 of the Industrial Assurance Act exemptsjuvenile societies and branches employing collectors from the provisions of the Act until .31st Beeember 1925:    and enables the Industrial Assurance Commissioner to exempt from the Act such societies and branches, if they were registered before that date.2c This section as It stands does not permit of the exemption of Societies with both adult and  juvenile members who employ collectors only for juvenile members,  though there is no good reason why they should not be exempted provided that they are branches of,  or connected with,  friendly societies which were registered at the date of the passing of the Industrial Assurance Act,   and provided that the receipt of premiums by means of collectors is limited to the premiums of the  juvenile members...      These provisos are necessary in order to prevent the setting up of such seeioties for the purpose of evading; the general provisions of the Industrial Assurance Act.3. In some eases it has been possible to surmount thedifficulty by forming a separate  juvenile society or branch: but as the final date for the registration of  juvenile societies so as to entitle them to ask for exemption is now past, even this remedy is no longer open in outstanding cases. The National Conference of Friendly Societies has been pressing for the removal of this difficulty, and the Industrial Assurance Commissioner assents.EGRET.P* 59(26).CABINET.1.
