this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT      2 7 SPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence. &quot;&quot;February 1936.MOST SECRET. Copy No.   44D.P.R. (D.R.) to BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements.PROGRAMMES OF THE DEFENCE SERVICES.REPORT.I. Introduction.IN October 1935 the Cabinet were informed (CP. 187 (35)) that the (Official) Defence Requirements Committee had been instructed to re-examine the question of Defence Requirements with special reference to the programmes of the Navy, Army and Air Force and to make recommendations for the future. The terms of reference of the Committee, for this purpose, were communicated at the same time to the Cabinet, who approved the procedure which had been adopted (Cabinet 45 (35)).2. The Report of the (Official) Defence Requirements Committee was presented to the Prime Minister on the 21st November, 1935, and was referred to the Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements, the membership of which was, by direction of the Prime Minister, slightly varied for the specific consideration of this Report; the consequent constitution of our Committee is given in Annex A.3. We have had nine meetings, and now submit to the Cabinet our observations and recommendations on the Report before us, a copy of which, with its Schedules, is attached hereto.II. The International Situation.4. We appreciate that in the Section dealing with the International Situation the Defence Requirements Committee desired to analyse the various factors which tend to disturb the peace and so to lead up to the measures which they recommend the Government to adopt to remedy a situation which is admittedly fraught with grave danger to this country. We have read this important Section of their Report in this light, and we agree that it represents a generally accurate picture of the state of international affairs. The wording and the emphasis is, of course, that of the Defence Requirements Committee, and, whilst we accept the general reasoning, it should not be assumed that it necessarily represents in detail our own views.5.   We can, however, fully associate ourselves with the deduction reached in paragraph 22 of the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee as to the [12683] b
four possible policies on which this country&apos;s international relationships may be based, i.e. : (i) Adherence to the system of collective security provided for in theCovenant of the League of Nations; (ii) A more limited system of collective security on the Locarno model;(iii) The pre-war system of alliances and ententes; or(iv) Isolation.The leadership of a strong Britain is now clearly essential to the success of the Covenant system; if the Covenant were to fail, co-operation and aid may be expected from other nations only to the extent that Britain is recognised as being-strong and ready; an isolationist policy would undoubtedly require the greatest strength of all. We are in full agreement with the views thus expressed by the Defence Requirements Committee and with their deduction (paragraph 23 of their Report) : &quot; The lesson we draw from recent events is the paramount necessity, whatever our policy in future, for making ourselves sufficiently strong to enable us to take our full share in maintaining the peace of the world and so to preserve ourselves, in the hope that a time may ultimately come when mutual reductions of armaments by consent may become possible without upsetting the equilibrium.   That time, however, is not yet.&quot;III. Defence Requirements (General).6. Continuing from their review of the international situation, the Defence &quot;Requirements Committee proceed to outline their views on Defence Requirements as a whole, recording the new factors of a recrudescence of German naval strength; the possibility of a hostile Italy on our main line of communications to the Far East; and the possibility of heavy and continuous air attack from Germany. In connection with our communications to the Far East the Defence Requirements Committee remark that our defence requirements are so serious that it would not be possible within the three-year period with which this Report mainly deals, to make provision for the case of a hostile Italy; we feel that the view that it is not urgently necessary nor feasible to make provision for a permanently hostile Italy should be endorsed.7. But even excluding Italy, the new considerations in the situation of to-day have led the Committee to make recommendations for revised standards of security in the case of all three Services. It will be convenient if we record our views on these new standards individually in the following Sections dealing with each Service concerned.IV. Navy Programme and Requirements.8. Since 1932 the standard of naval strength has for practical purposes been based on the following formula : &quot; We should be able to send to the Far East a Fleet sufficient to provide &apos; cover&apos; against the Japanese Fleet; we should have sufficient additional forces behind this shield for the protection of our territory and mercantile marine against Japanese attack; at the same time we should be able to retain in European waters a force sufficient to act as a deterrent and to prevent the strongest European Naval Power from obtaining control of our vital Home terminal areas while we can make the necessary redispositions.&quot; (N.C.M. (35) 12.)The coming increase in German naval power combined with continuing anxiety for the safety of our possessions in the Far East have properly led the Defence Requirements Committee to a careful reconsideration of our naval needs, .and they recommend a netv standard of naval strength defined as follows : (i) To enable us to place a Fleet in the Far East fully adequate to act onthe defensive and to serve as a strong deterrent against any threat to our interests in that part of the globe.(ii) To maintain in all circumstances in Home Waters a force able to meetthe requirements of a war with Germany at the same time.
Included in (i) and (ii) would be the forces necessary in all parts of the world, behind the cover of the main fleets, to protect our territories and merchant ships against sporadic attacks.During the next three years, however, there are difficulties from the point of view of provision both of material and personnel, which render it difficult to take any considerable steps towards the attainment of the proposed new standard. Moreover, what would be involved by the adoption of the new standard has not yet been worked out in detail, and we consider that approval for this standard should be reserved until the practical effects can be more precisely 1st Recom-estimated. *  mendatio*-9. In the same connection we have had some discussion on the Cruiser replacement programme, which at present involves the building of five ships a year between 1936 and 1939. A new naval standard of security will no doubt involve a higher strength in cruisers, as well as in other types of ships. In these circumstances we agreed to ask the Admiralty (i) to work out the naval programme required to give effect to the new 2nd Recom-standard of naval security as soon as the necessary data are available; mendat,on&apos; and(ii) to make suggestions as to any items in the new programme that can be put in hand before the expiration of the next three years;and to withhold, until that information was received  a recommendation for approval for the new standard of naval strength referred to.10.   Items of naval requirements based on past standards are put forward by the Defence Requirements Committee as follows :- Capital Ships.A replacement programme of seven ships in the period 1937-39 inclusive (2:3: 2). This will provide equality in new ships with Germany and Japan in 1942 on the important assumption that Japan does not start building at a greater rate than has been assumed by the Admiralty.Aircraft Carriers.Four new Carriers (some of a smaller type) within the period 1936-42. Cruisers.The proposal is for a replacement programme of five ships a year, but since our ultimate provision of cruisers is dependent on a number of factors, including the acceptance or otherwise of a &quot; new standard&quot; of naval defence, we consider that this programme should be adopted, for the present, provisionally and subject to later review.Destroyer Leaders and Destroyers.A further flotilla of destroyer leaders in 1936-37, and subsequently a flotilla of destroyers in alternate years up to 1942.Submarines, Sloops and Small craft.To continue at the present rate of about three submarines and five or six sloops a year.Deficiencies.The provision of reserves of ammunition, anti-submarine equipment, stores, &amp;c, together with the modernisation of Capital Ships. Complete moderni-sation is proposed for three of our Capital Ships and partial for four more. The Nelson, Rodney and Hood will not require modernisation. The question of the modernisation of the remaining five ships must depend on future developments, one of the most important of which will be the extent to which other Powers retain their older Capital Ships.Personnel.An expansion in strength by some 35,600 spread over 1936-42.[12683] b 2
Fleet Air Arm.An increase from 190 aircraft (embarked in carrier and catapult ships) in 1935 to 357 in 1939, and 504 in 1942. The corresponding anticipated figures for the United States of America and Japan, in 1938, are 670 and 374 respectively.Expediting Naval Construction.Emphasis has been laid on the desirability of expediting construction by laying down ships earlier in the year than has hitherto been usual. Several months&apos; acceleration could thereby be gained yearly.11. With all the above proposals, which lie within the existing approved standard of naval strength, we are in agreement and recommend them for approval by the Cabinet, with the reservation that the cruiser programme should be adopted only provisionally and subject to later review.The provision of a new standard of naval defence, decision on which is post-poned for the present,, would necessitate an increase in all classes of ships and also of personnel.V. Army Programme and Requirements.12. The standard of security recommended by the Defence Requirements Committee for the Army is : (i) To maintain garrisons overseas on the present general basis for purposesof Imperial Defence, (ii) To provide for the military share in Home Defence which includesanti-aircraft defence, Coast Defence and internal security, (iii) To. enable us to provide reinforcements and/or a Field Force from Home in time of emergency or war, with adequate equipment and reserves.Under (i) and (ii) the most important requirements are a substantial improve-ment in coast defences at Naval bases at Home and Abroad, and the completion of the Army&apos;s share in the Air Defence of Great Britain.Under (iii) the Defence Requirements Committee state that the most important requirement is to organise a Field Force which can be sent abroad at short notice for the protection of our vital interests, and to enable us to honour our i international obligations, particularly under the Treaty of Locarno, which would involve effective co-operation with other signatories on the Continent of Europe. This may include joining with our allies in ensuring the occupation by the allies and the denial to the enemy of advanced air bases in the Low Countries.4th reeom- 13.   We recommend the acceptance of (i) and (ii) above, and also of (iii)mendation.      subject to certain reservations in regard to the role of the Territorial Force, which i  are dealt with later.14. We feel that we should inform the Cabinet that we have very closely considered the importance of the Low Countries to our own security in its air aspects. The Chiefs of Staff have on more than one occasion emphasised the strategical importance of the Low Countries; an extract from a Report of 1933 is attached as Annexe B, to which we call attention. We are prepared to accept the renewed advice given to us, with its implications as to the need for i  modernising and making good the deficiencies of the Regular Army.15. The role proposed for the Army will require the provision of a Regular Field Force Contingent of four Divisions; a Mobile Division (i.e., a reorganised Cavalry Division of mechanised units), two Air Defence Brigades, Army Co-operation Squadrons of the Royal Air Force, together with the necessary complement of General Headquarters, Corps and Line of Communications troops; the whole provided with all its essential needs in modern armament and material.16. It should be remarked that this proposal is for modernizing and re-equipping the Army; except for the provision of three new Tank Battalions and one Air Defence Brigade, the formation of which has already begun as a result of the present emergency, no increase in the number of units and formations in the Regular Army is proposed to meet the needs of this Contingent.17. If our assistance to Continental allies is to be effective, the Regular Field Force Contingent must be available as soon as possible, but at present3rd Recom-mendation.
-5 277practical limits make it impossible to disembark the whole of this force in less than many weeks. The necessary acceleration so that the force may disembark within a fortnight will involve an annual recurrent expenditure for personnel, rising to an ultimate figure of about  1^ million.18. We are agreed that the Regular Army should be properly equipped in all respects and ready for any role which it may be called upon to perform. We submit the following conclusions to the Cabinet for confirmation :- (a) To adopt paragraphs 65 to 67 (dealing with the proposals for the Regular 5th Recom-Field Force), subject to examination by the Treasury Inter-Service metl atlon&apos; Committee of the figure of  1,100,000 to  1,500,000 given in para-graph 67 for the increase of the annual recurrent expenditure on speeding up the rate of mobilisation for the Regular Field Force.(b) That the Army programme for the reconstitution of the Regular field force (which, in full, extended beyond five years) should be accepted for a five-year period only, with a view to obtaining within that time a fully efficient Regular contingent of the Field Force, complete with personnel, material and war reserves of all kinds.19. The proposals of the Defence Requirements Committee for the Territorial Army aimed at supporting the Regular Contingent by Territorial divisions at intervals of 4, 6 and 8 months, dating from the outbreak of war. At each of these intervals four Territorial Divisions were to be ready to reinforce the Regular Contingent, and the 5th Regular Division, which exists in peace, was to be used to stiffen the first four territorial divisions to go abroad. The cost of modernizing and placing these twelve Territorial Divisions in a state of readiness for war on the above basis, including the necessary reserves of ammunition, is estimated at about  45* millions; this sum being additional to  250,000 a year already authorised for improving the inadequate equipment and aids to training available for the Territorial Army. This will include the raising of a few cadres for non-existent units.20. We have scrutinised these proposals with much care and we have been informed that, even if they were now approved, little could, in fact, be done during the next three years towards the actual provision of the material needed to modernize the Territorial Army and to equip it for war. There is a limit to what industry can do in the first years, and questions of priority therefore arise; it is clear that the prior needs of the Regular Army, not to mention those of the Navy and the Air Force, will strain to the utmost our productive capacity. There are also political difficulties in any public announcements laying down in much detail the future role of the Territorial Army.  Nevertheless, we are fully aware . . &apos;.&apos;oi the difficulties which beset the Territorial Army in peace, and we consider that all possible steps should be taken to improve their recruiting and efficiency.Moreover, we appreciate that it is the desire of the Territorial Army to be assured that, in the event of its being used to reinforce the Regular Army, it shall do so in its own units and formations, and not by draft finding.21.   In these circumstances we submit the following Conclusions to the Cabinet: (i) To reserve the decision as to whether or when the proposals for recon- ,ith Recom-reconditioning the Territorial Force can be implemented, for three years, mem,at,on-or until such time as the industrial situation of the country and its capacity for output brings these proposals within the range of actual possibilities by which time other factors in the decision may have become clearer.(ii) Subject to (i), to authorise the War Office in the meanwhile to work out in detail their plans for implementing the proposals in the Report. &apos;(iii) To confirm the previous decision to allot  250,000 a year to the Territorial Force.(iv) To authorise the War Office to state publicly that the function of the . Territorial Field Force is to serve wherever it is needed, and that.it will, if necessary, be: used as a second line, not as drafts, but serving in its own units and formations, to support the Regular Army if it ,       goes.abroad.   And, further, that it.is the policy of the Army Council&quot;*&apos; includes1about  5 millions under items (a) (ii) and &apos;(;/) in Table II in the attached report.   &quot;.:
7th Recom-mendation.8th Recom-mendation.9th Recom-mendation.to complete the peace establishment of the Territorial Force within the next three years, but that its equipment can only proceed slowly for the present, as priority must be given to the Regular Army.The effects of the above will be to postpone for later decision expenditure estimated at  45 million on the modernization of 12 Territorial divisions intended to give them the necessary material, including ammunition, to take part in modern war.Ammunition.22. One effect of our suggestions regarding the Territorial Force is considerably &quot;to reduce the scale of ammunition reserves to be provided in the next three years, since the requirements of the Territorial divisions in this respect will be temporarily in abeyance. The figure is reduced from the estimated  35-2 million to about  21 million (including ammunition for the new artillery equipment). This latter amount will be needed to provide reserves of ammunition for the Regular contingent to bridge the gap from the outbreak of war until the war-expanded industry of the country can meet requirements, and we consider ammunition to the latter amount should be provided.Coast Defence.23. The proposals of the Defence Requirements Committee under this bead are : (a) Singapore. Completion of the 2nd Stage of the defences, already accepted in principle, by the provision of three further 6-inch gun batteries and 6 defence electric lights and barracks for a third British Battalion.(b) Hong  Kong,  Aden,  Ceylon  and  Penang. The  completion  of  the authorised programme in 10 years instead of 15. It should be noted that if Article XIX of the Washington Treaty is to lapse further increase might be entailed for Hong Kong.(c) Malta, Gibraltar and Freetown. Acceleration of the authorised pro-gramme from 20 to 14 years. Certain of these proposals may require revision in an upward direction if the Mediterranean situation is to remain unsatisfactory.(d) Home Ports. An increase to  75,000 per annum of the  25,000 perannum already allotted, the present allotment being quite insufficient to remedy even urgent requirements.We recommend to the Cabinet the proposals outlined above for accelerating the Coast Defence Programme.Air Defence of Great Britain.24. We consider that authority for the completion of the programme of anti-aircraft defences, which has already been given in part, should ho longer be delayed, and we agreed :  .(a) To recommend the adoption of the proposals for the Air Defence of Great Britain; to note that these brought within sight of completion in five years the full scale of anti-aircraft defence as put forward in the Report circulated to the Cabinet as CP. 144 (35); and to note also that the annual allotment proposed for this purpose in Paper No. D.P.R. 52 would furnish the greatest acceleration practicable in the next two or three years, at the end of which time the allotment might require further consideration;(6) to take note of the fact that the approval by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their meeting held on the 30th January, 1936, of the pro-posals for ammunition requirements of the Air Defence of Great Britain (C.I.D. Paper No. 219-A) would result in some reduction in the cost of the Scheme as estimated in the Defence Requirements Report;(c) to recommend that the War Office, in implementing the Scheme, should, as far as practicable, exercise circumspection in order that changes could, if necessary, be introduced to meet the event of future develop-ments in other means of air defence;
10th Recom-mendation.(d) to note that approval for the proposals in the Report under consideration would be complementary to the partial authority already given by the Cabinet (Cabinet 40 (35) Conclusion 5) and the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee.]\few Infantry Battalions.25. The report of the Defence Requirements Committee recommends the formation of an additional four battalions, and our attention was drawn to the fact that, as compared with 1914, we have 22 less battalions to guard Imperial interests, which are greater than ever. Their proposal is limited to four battalions merely because recruiting difficulties to-day offer no hope of being able to raise more.  We approved this proposal, subject to the concurrence of the Cabinet.Re-equipment of Field A artillery.26. The War Office have under tests an 18-pdr. gun relined to take a 25-pound shell. Trials to date have been satisfactory and, if they so continue, they recommend that this converted gun should replace the existing 18-pdrs. and 4-5-inch howitzers. These equipments were put into service about 30 years ago and are definitely inferior to corresponding German weapons of more modern design. Re-equipment of Artillery has periodically to be faced, and it would seem very undesirable now to pile up great stocks of ammunition reserves for obsolescent weapons.27. If time were available it would no doubt be preferable to design an entirely new piece so as to take the field with the most modern weapon, but we are informed that it would take some two years before even the first gun of a new design would become available. That is a delay which we do not think acceptable aDd we are informed that the converted 18-pdr. will be a notable advance on the present equipments. We think therefore that we should accept the proposals for conversion of the 18-pdr. gun, subject to design being actively continued towards a new gun which will take the same new type of ammunition, and our recommendation is : To approve the proposals for the re-equipment of the Field Artillery on the understanding that the converted 18-pdrs. therein referred to would be the first &apos;&apos; mark &quot; of a new gun, and that a further &apos;&apos; mark &apos;&apos; would be designed capable of taking the same ammunition as the converted 18-pdr. 11th recommendation-1 mendation.Improvement in Housing.28. The housing conditions in the Army are admittedly very unsatisfactory and it is full time that steps were taken for their improvement. The cost, additional to the present rate of normal annual expenditure, is estimated in the Report as  10 million over the next ten years, but we are informed that a later calculation has reduced this figure and that the rate of expenditure will be a matter for subsequent determination.Our recommendation is : To approve in principle the proposals for the improvement in housing of the Army, and to note that there will be some reduction in the rate of expenditure originally proposed.Recruiting.29. No specific suggestions are made in the Report to deal with the recruiting difficulties for the Army, but the matter has received most anxious consideration in the War Office and we understand that proposals are likely shortly to be submitted to the Cabinet. The Report of the Defence Requirements Committee indicates that, if further efforts prove inadequate, it may be necessary in the last resort to propose an increase of pay of the forces so as to compete with conditions in the labour market. It will be appreciated that such action might well have very far-reaching results on industry, including those branches of industry which will be hard put to it to meet the needs of the Services. In these circumstances, whilst we fully appreciate the need for taking active steps to improve recruiting both in the Regular and Territorial Army, we must enter a -caveat as to the objections, from the point of view of the whole economic position of industry, to an increase in the pay of the Forces which would compete with12th recommendation-mendation.
conditions existing in the labour market. Meanwhile, we note that the improve-ment in housing referred to in the preceding paragraph is a move in the direction of better amenities and should help recruiting (see also 24th Recommendation).13th Reeom-mendation.14th Recom-mendation.loth Recom-mendation.16th Recom-mendation.VI.-Air Force Programme and Requirements.30. The first recommendation of the Defence Requirements Committee in the Air Force Programme is for the completion of our metropolitan first-line strength to a total of 123 squadrons (1,512 aircraft) by April 1937 for which authority has already been given. It should be noted, however, that under our present policy of numerical parity with Germany it may be necessary to reconsider this figure, for there is, unfortunately, increasing evidence that Germany is not likely to be content with a figure of less than 2,000 first-line aircraft. This is a subject which, at the proper time, may require thorough reconsideration.Apart from that consideration, however, we agreed to recommend : (a) Completion of the expansion programme of the Royal Air Force already authorised; and(&amp;) That the Air Ministry should have latitude to vary the Royal Air Force programme so as to improve its offensive power and constitute the most effective deterrent against German aggression. It should be appreciated that this will involve some increase in numbers in addition to the substitution of larger and more efficient machines for those envisaged in the latter part of the present programme.Army Co-operation Squadrons.31. For the Regular Contingent.-We recommend the provision of 7 squadrons (each of 12 aircraft) and&apos; 1 squadron for communication purposes to accompany the Regular Contingent.   (5 squadrons are already in existence.)For the Territorial Army. In view of our proposal to reserve the decision as to whether, or when, the proposals for reconditioning the Territorial Army can be implemented we feel justified in suggesting a reduction in the number of squadrons of army co-operation aircraft intended to accompany territorial divisions. For a number of reasons it is inadvisable to make no provision at all under this head, and whilst reserving approval to the full proposals for providing&apos; the Territorial Army with army co-operation squadrons until the detailed proposals for the role of the Territorial Army in war is brought up for further consideration, we recommend :-That authority should be given to make a beginning with the equipment and provision of Army Co-operation squadrons for the Territorial Army by the provision of 4 additional auxiliary squadrons.It may be noted that this provision will still further increase the strength of our first-line aircraft above the figure of 1,512.Fleet Air Arm.32. As noted in paragraph 10 we recommend provision by 1942 of a first-line strength of 504 aircraft, and the consequent provision of further shore accommodation at home and abroad.17th Recom-mendation.Overseas Squadrons.33. We recommend approval for the following proposals contained in the Report to be adopted as circumstances permit: Singapore. An additional land-plane reconnaissance squadron and two additional operational landing grounds.J Penang, &quot;Ceylon, Aden. One land-plane reconnaissance squadron at each of these places.Hong Kong. The provision of a total of 4 squadrons and one spotter flight, together with a repair unit and an additional aerodrome.-Middle East. An additional squadron to increase the strategic reserve in the Middle East Command.East Africa. One general purpose&apos;squadron.
yMalta.-The provision of one composite squadron (4 flights) for Malta has been put forward as an urgent requirement, and we agree.  An increase to 2 squadrons and 1 spotter flight may later become .    .        necessary, but authority for this should, we consider, be reserved.West Africa and West Indies. The Eeport recommends the establish-ment of an aerodrome and one general purpose squadron at Sierra Leone and a reconnaissance squadron in the West Indies, but we understand that this is held to be in a lower order of priority to other overseas requirements, and we consider that approval should be reserved for the present.Gibraltar. Investigations are taking place as to the feasibility of constructing an aerodrome at Gibraltar. This forms an essential, and at present missing, link in our air communications, and we have accepted, in principle, the desirability of an air base at that place. War Reserves.34. The main item of expenditure in the Defence Requirements Committee&apos;s recommendations is for the provision of war reserves. It should not be necessary to emphasise that the provision of air forces will not avail in war if they are not given the means to fight, and to continue fighting. This applies to aircraft, personnel, ammunition and material of all kinds and the proposals put forward have been worked out as accurately as circumstances will permit.The vast problem of industrial production affects, of course, all three Services and is dealt with in the next Section of the Report; but in connection with Air Force needs we have agreed : (a) In principle, that the Air Ministry should include in their programme isth Reeom-provision of war reserves on the basis of the proposal of the Defence mendatlon-Requirements Committee.    The detailed steps to carry out this programme will, of course, be discussed with the Treasury.(b) That the Air Ministry should continue to work out plans for the employ -ment of the shadow aircraft industry to the extent to which it might be necessary to utilise this industry to fulfil their expansion programme, and should proceed with the necessary arrangements to give effect to these plans, taking care that in doing so they act in conformity with the allocation of firms under the general plan for the shadow industry referred to below.(c) That the Air Ministry, in making plans for increasing industrial output to meet their programme, should make allowance for future orders likely to be received from foreign countries for military aircraft, so far as these could be estimated.VII. Industrial Production.35. The most serious factor in the completion of the proposed programme is the limited output of our existing industrial resources. The key to successful completion of the Services programmes lies in the solution of the industrial problem. Were ample time available it would be a less complicated matter, but there is an urgent need to restore deficiencies which have accumulated over the last fifteen years.36. The proposals put forward by the Defence Requirements Committee aim at the maximum estimated achievement within the next 3 years, but there are many items for all three Services which it is physically impossible to complete within that time. This emphasises the need to make an immediate start. It has rightly been urged that we must aim at securing our Service needs without interference with or reduction of production for civil and export trade. From the production point of view this greatly complicates the matter, but any such interference would adversely affect the general prosperity of the country and so&apos; reduce our capacity to find the necessary funds for the Service programmes. It would undoubtedly attract Parliamentary criticism.37.   The Ministerial members of the Committee wish to place on record then indebtedness to Lord Weir, whose advice and assistance has been of the very greatest value.   He put forward to us his views in a Memorandum which is attached as Annexe C and which we commend to the notice of the Cabinet. [12683] c
38. As Lord Weir indicates, the problem is a dual one. In the first place we have, in time of peace, greatly to expand our output capacity in order to meet the demands to be made upon it. In the second place, we have to build up a reserve of output capacity which can be brought into operation as soon as possible after the outbreak of war. Although these problems must be kept separate, the solution of the first of these will go some way towards the solution of the second, since the greater the peace time output the less remains to be done for war.39. It has already been accepted that the output of our Government factories and&quot; professional&quot; armament firms, however much expanded, will be insufficient for war needs and that recourse will have to be made to what is termed a &quot;shadow armament industry.&quot; The principle of such an industry is that firms who do not normally make warlike stores are engaged to do so by placing orders with them in peace time on a relatively small scale, on the condition that they lay out their works and hold machinery for a war output greatly in excess of their peace production. Initial steps for the creation of this &quot; shadow armament industry &quot; in war have already been taken by the Principal Supply Officers Committee Organisation, but we are now advised that the needs of the proposed programme cannot be met by Government factories and profes-sional armament firms alone, and that it will be necessary not only to create but to put into operation a part of the &apos;&apos; shadow industry &apos;&apos; in peace. :. 40. The problem is as complicated as it is important, and it does not lend itself to summarisation, but we call attention to a few of its more important aspects.Machine Tools.41. One of the most important limiting factors lies in specialised machinery of all kinds and especially machine tools. Our own machine tool industry is already fully employed and urgent steps are necessary to develop that industry to meet the demands that will fall upon it.Skilled Labour.42. A further difficulty lies in the shortage of skilled labour, a shortage which cannot rapidly be met by the training-up of semi-skilled labour. We doubt whether Governmental assistance, in the form of technical training schools, can be of any real assistance. The solution lies with the firms themselves; it is better and quicker that men should be trained &quot;on the job.&quot; Although this will take time, we believe it to be the only practicable method, indeed, certain firms, notably Vickers, Ltd., have already started training classes of their own in anticipation of the demand.Collaboration of Industry and the Prevention of Profiteering.43. We have already received proof that the Federation of British Industries is prepared willingly to collaborate with us, and we set much store on the estab-lishment of good relations between the Government and Industry, both in the latter&apos;s overhead organisation and, in detail, with the individual firms concerned. While we attach importance to the good offices of the Federation of British Industries as a factor in securing goodwill on the part of British industry, we accept Lord Weir&apos;s view that &quot;the really effective and essential contact- and collaboration must take place on the lower rungs of the ladder,&quot; that is to say, &quot;as regards direct contractors, between them and the Supply Departments, and as regards secondary and ancillary sections of industry, with small committees appointed within the sections, usually by the trade organisations.&quot; The placing -of contracts, the terms of remuneration and the prevention of profiteering are all matters which will require the closest consideration throughout the whole period of the programme. As a preliminary measure we have appointed a small committee under the Chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer with a term of reference :- &apos;&apos; To investigate the question of what arrangements should be made to provide against excessive profits- being made by contractors, having regard to the political considerations (including the statement on the subject in the Governments election manifesto), the importance of obtaining the goodwill of the Contractors, and other factors in the problem.&quot;Their Report is attached in Annex D and is submitted for approval.
Financial Control.44.   Lord Weir, in emphasising the need for speed, has seated in his Memorandum :  &quot; . . . . the conditions are in some measure akin to War conditions. The word of the man responsible for Supply must carry, and the spirit and enthusiasm which he has evoked in the contractors mind must nOt be chilled by delays of approvals, caused by financial control. I do not mean that any loose disregard should prevail on the financial side, but the keynote must be that &apos; the job must go ahead.&apos; &quot;We are at one with Lord Weir in agreeing to the urgency of the matter, but it would of course be impossible to adopt any unconstitutional methods of financing whereby the Treasury loses control over expenditure. We have no reason to believe that Treasury control, adapted to meet the particular circumstances, is incompatible with rapidity; the machinery lies to hand in the existing Inter-Service Treasury Committee which has proved most effective during the crisis caused by the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. There will be new types of demands made, for example not only will there be the usual payments to be made for goods supplied, but also financial assistance will be needed to help firms to develop their manufacturing capacity to meet the orders. This new form of demand will obviously be of great urgency since until it is met a start cannot be made.Organisation of Supply.45. Whilst the existing machinery for co-ordinating the demands of the Services must clearly remain in existence, with such modifications as experience may prove necessary, it has been suggested that the supply side of the War Office will require reorganisation in order to cope with their extremely difficult task. The Secretary of State for War concurs in this view and an examination of the subject has already been begun. We are particularly glad to record that Lord Weir has accepted the invitation of the Secretary of State for War to render his good offices to the War Office and to advise them in the same valuable way as he has already assisted the Air Ministry.Priority.46. We agree with the recommendation of the Defence Requirements Committee, which is supported by Lord Weir, that that Committee should be the final authority on any differences of opinion which may arise on the priority to be given to different forms of supply, but we are of the opinion that every effort must be made to reach agreement departmentally or through the Principal Supply Officers Organisation before having resort to the Committee.Supervision.47. We attach importance to the provision of appropriate machinery for watching the development of these plans not only within the Government Depart-ments concerned, but also by the Government itself, so that, where delays occur, appropriate action may be taken to remove the causes. We recommend that the Cabinet should entrust this duty to ourselves (the Defence Policy and Require-ments Sub-Committee).48.   Our conclusions on these various matters are as follows : (a) To approve in principle the general guiding scheme formulated by 19th Recom-Lord Weir in his Memorandum (Paper No. D.P.R. (D.R.) 8), and to mendation authorise the Government Departments concerned, in consultation with Lord Weir and the Chairman of the Supply Board as required., to work out the necessary details without waiting for Cabinet confir1 mation. This should include permission to enter on discussion witli Industrial firms on the basis of long-term contracts, but not to conclude any negotiation until after the Cabinet has taken its decision. In discussion with the professional firms the Government Departments should be at liberty to explain the general plan of the establishment and use of a &quot; shadow industry.&quot;[12683] c 2
(b) To take note that under Lord Weir&apos;s proposals the supplies called forin the 3-5 years&apos; programmes are to be secured without interference with or reduction of production for civil and export trade.(c) To take note that Sir Warren Fisher and Lord Weir have seen thePresident of the Federation of British Industries, who, offering every possible assistance, have already appointed their own Committee, which holds itself at the disposal of the Government.(d) To take note that Lord Weir is prepared to advise the Secretary of Statefor War on the problems of reorganisation of the supply side of the War Office required to give effect to Lord Weir&apos;s proposals.(e) That the  staff and organisation  of  the  Supply  Board  TechnicalEstablishment will require examination as a corollary to carrying out Lord Weir&apos;s recommendation that the existing full-time part should be associated with the new Munitions Supply Department of the War Office.(/) That Lord Weir&apos;s proposal that the final authority for priority appeals should rest wdth the Defence Requirements Committee should be approved subject to the understanding that resort should be made first to the machinery of the Principal Supply Officers Committee Organisation.(g) That the progress of each Defence Service in regard to its programmes should be reported monthly to the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements.(h) In this connection the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Require-ments should be kept informed of any developments within the industries concerned (such as incipient disputes in regard to rates of wages or apprenticeship) which might endanger the industrial programme; and for this purpose the Sub-Committee should receive monthly reports from the Ministry of Labour.(i) To accept Lord Weir&apos;s recommendation that &quot; the word of the manresponsible for supply must carry,&quot; and to interpret this as meaning that any necessary authority to go ahead from the Treasury must be promptly forthcoming without waiting for settlement of every detail. In order to secure rapid decisions, use should be made of the Treasury Inter-Service Committee, the functions of which should in cases of necessity include cases where it is desired to allow firms to make arrangements to proceed with manufacture in advance of the conclusion of a final contract (e.g., making an outlay for the erection or adaptation of buildings or obtaining plant). The Treasury Inter-Service Committee should have power, where it thinks fit, to deal with such cases in blocks.20th Reeom-mendation.VIII.-Miscellaneous Requirements.Air Raids Precautions.49. We recommend for adoption the proposals of the Home Office for the provision of Respirators (which has already been accepted by the Cabinet), which will amount to a possible total of  4,400,000, together with other miscellaneous items, protective clothing, bleach powder, &amp;o, amounting to some  610,000.Woolwich, Billingham and Ardeer.50. Consideration is already being given to an alternative site for Woolwich Arsenal, and Ardeer, though very important, is of less urgency that the serious problem raised by the concentration at Billingham, undefended and indefensible from air attack, of the whole of our output of a number of commodities essential in war.2l6t Recom-jnendotion.We agreed &quot; To ask Lord Weir to take up with Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., the problems raised by the exposed position of Billingham, and to make proposals for ameliorating the situation.&quot;
IX. Cost and Finance.4^19 1w U J22nd Recom-mandation.23rd recommendation-mendationThe detailed figures for individual items were set out in the various53.Tables and  Schedules  of  the Defence Requirements  Committee&apos;s  Reporl The very speculative figures there given for the total of Service Estimates, including the costs of the proposals submitted to us, result for the three Defence Services in an increased annual expenditure over the  124 million (original Estimates voted for defence in 1935) of the order of  1936       ................      49,650,000*1937 1938 1939 194086,750,000 102,400,000 88,450,000 90,050,000and, in addition, an increase in the Home Office vote for Air Raid Precautions *of  1,847,000 a year and a recommendation for increased provision for Secret Service Avork up to  500,000 per annum.54. As the result of our Conclusions as recorded above, certain reductions in the above figures will be possible. We have requested the Service Departments to work out revised figures in further detail, but, tentatively, it may be said that the annual increased expenditure (over 1935 Estimates) for the Services will be somewhat as follows :  Ag1936       ...       .....        ......       50,700,000t1937 1938 1939 194088.800,000 101,500,000 80,500,000 73,000.000It will be realised that at this stage it is well nigh impossible to forecast accurately the incidence year by year of expenditure on the reconditioning of the forces, although the total expenditure required can be estimated with less inaccuracy. For example, quite apart from the difficulty of estimating future prices and rates of production, it is obvious that as no orders for additional material have yet been placed and new firms are not yet prepared for the manu-facture of the stores concerned, the total sum shown against 1936-37 could certainly not be spent in that year, and a large carry over would be necessary even if the programme were authorised in the next few weeks.* Subsequent to the preparation of Naval Table I in the attached report the Admiralty have formed a closer estimate of their proposed expenditure for 1936 which results in an increase of  2i million in the figure for 1936 shown above.f Includes provision in 1936, as far as can be foreseen, for the special measures connected with the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, and the  2^ million referred to in the preceding footnote., - &apos; ..    -Secret Service.51. We endorse the view expressed that an increase in Secret Service funds is necessary, and, in order that the Treasury may at. once proceed to work out detailed proposals for the next financial year, we agreed &quot; To approve in principle the proposals for an increased expenditure on the Secret Service.&quot;The Colonies, Dominions and India.52. The Report points out that financial difficulties in recent years have resulted in reductions in the forces maintained in the Colonies, Mandated Territories, &amp;c, and recommends that consideration should be given to restoring them to their former strength. It recommends also that the attention of the Dominions should be drawn to the measures to be taken in this country, and that their co-operation should be sought in reducing the burden or alternatively in increasing the scale of security provided, and, further, that the Government of India should again be urged to expedite the remedying of their &apos;&apos; worst deficiencies.&quot;We associate ourselves with all these recommendations, to which we desire to draw the special attention of the Cabinet.
It should be explained that these figures take into account, not only the reductions resulting from the conclusions referred to above, but also other changes in defence expenditure which have taken place since the Tables in the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee were prepared. Thus, the figure for 1936 includes provision, so far as this can be foreseen, for the special measures connected with the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, and is also based on the higher estimate referred to in the footnote of the proposed expenditure in 1936. Certain other items involving increased expenditure have also been taken into account. The net result is that the aggregate expenditure for the three years 1936, 1937 and 1938, after taking into account all these changes, shows an increase of  2 millions over the rate of expenditure shown in table IV of the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee. A substantial decrease is, however, shown in respect of the years 1939 and 1940.55. For the present these figures must be taken only as an indication of the order of magnitude of the expenditure involved. Full details will have to-be worked out subsequently and agreed with the Treasury.X. Observations.56. We have no comment to make on the general observations with which the Defence Requirements Committee conclude their Report, indeed, we are in general agreement with the views there expressed. The amended programme which we now put forward for approval by the Cabinet is, like that of the Defence Requirements Committee, subject to later modification, in one direction or another, in accordance with events, and changes in circumstances, which cannot for the moment be accurately foreseen, whether in Europe, the Far East, or the Mediterranean. For example, if our situation vis-a-vis Italy is to remain on an unsatisfactory basis, there will be additional responsibilities which all three Services will&apos; have to face.57. A programme of this magnitude cannot be completed without the co-operation of all the Departments of State, including those indirectly affected,, and we agreed  .;(a) To endorse the recommendations of the Defence Requirements Committee,, inviting the co-operation of all Departments of State in the rehabilitation-tation of the Services and directing attention, in particular, to the desirability of the Ministry of Labour relaxing existing restrictions on recruiting facilities at Unemployment Exchanges, training camps and centres.(b) That the attention of the Ministry of Labour, as well as of the other Departments mentioned by the Defence Requirements Committee, should be drawn to the necessity of improving the physical standard of the population,   //58. The programme is, in our opinion, the best that can be devised to meet the circumstances as they are to-day and, within the limits of human foresight, as they may develop. It was prepared for us by a very strong Committee with the best technical advice available, and even if circumstances should change, or fresh strategical considerations should emerge, we do not anticipate that the value of the recommendations which we are making to the Cabinet on the basis of the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee is -likely to be modified. Accordingly, we recommend the Cabinet to adopt the Report subject to the Nation01&quot;    modifications which we have proposed.Initialled on behalf of the Sub-Committee : S. B.

JL. Jf.w -Tr -TV&quot; -TV- &apos;/r&apos;&apos; Important as the Low Countries are to us in relation to sea power, they are-even more important in relation to air power. War in the air, like war on land or on sea, is largely a matter of time, distance and administration. An important factor in determining the weight of attack which a given air force can deliver is the distance of its air bases from vital objectives. If the Germans were to succeed in over-running the Low Countries and in establishing air bases near the Dutch or Belgian coasts, not only London but the whole of the industrial centres of the Midlands and North, as well as our shipping approaching the coasts, would be within effective and even decisive range of air attacks. The short range would enable those attacks to be heavy, continuous and sustained and would not allow time for the interception of the enemy&apos;s air forces.If, on the other hand, the integrity of the Low Countries, which implies that of Holland as well as of Belgium, were maintained, the Germans would be forced to initiate attacks by air at a distance of some 300-350 miles from London alone. The distance from the North and the Midlands and from our shipping approaching the Western ports would be even greater. The frequency and intensity of attacks would automatically be reduced and warning would be obtained of attacks by aircraft flying direct across territory in our occupation.&quot;4tr   , &apos; ..V. .     &apos; &apos;JL -ii- -ii- OA.I W *7V* TV W W
Industrial Production.Memorandum by Lord Weir.As promised, I have discussed with the Principal Supply Officers certain aspects of the measures recommended in the Report for organising increased industrial production, and I have further crystallised my own views and now outline my general conclusions.Paragraphs 89-100 set out some of the considerations concerned with Industrial Production. In principle I agree with them, but it may be of value if I re-arrange, elaborate and modify them into the form of a Statement of the Problem, and a General Plan for its solution to serve as a guidance scheme, which, if approved by the Committee, may enable all concerned to take action.The Problem.The problem is dual in character. First we have to decide on the most effective steps to secure the production of approximately  x millions of war material, mainly engineering in character, in a term expressed as 3/5 years, such production to be in excess of to-day&apos;s rate of expenditure on similar products.Secondly, but in some degree concurrently, we have to make the necessary arrangements for the turnover of Industry to war conditions on an emergency. This differentiation must be clear in the minds of all concerned. The first problem clearly calls for priority of action, but it is obvious that every step taken to solve it will vastly facilitate the solution of the second.The Supplies called for in the 3/5 years&apos; programmes are to be secured without interference with or reduction of production for civil and export trade.We have to obtain-this excess production under peace-time conditions, and with the Engineering Industry already operating as a whole under busy conditions.A rough estimate shows that the excess Supplies under the programmes will require the employment of an additional 120,000 men in Engineering, Ship-building, Chemical and Metallurgical Sections of Industry.Such is an outline of the novel and difficult task set to the Services and the sections of Industry concerned.The General Plan.Existing Sources of Supply.There are only two categories of these (a) The Professional Armament Industries, i.e., those private industrial units whose regular business it is to supply the peace-time needs of the Services.Examples : Naval Shipbuilders and Marine Engineers. Airframe and Aero-engine makers. Vickers, LCI.(&amp;) State Factories, such as Woolwich, Enfield and the Dockyards, operated by the State under the direction of the Services.The needs of the programmes, in particular the army programme, in some degree the Air programme, and in a much smaller degree the Naval programme, call for supplies on a scale which cannot be met even by the fullest expansion of these sources, and there is no alternative but to have recourse to the genera? Engineering units of the country as a new and additional source of supply.For the provision of the needs of the 3/5 years&apos; programme in the first place, and, secondly, as a structure on which to plan for war needs, we have now to create what has been called a &quot; Shadow Munition Industry.&quot;[DP.R. (D.R.) 8.] ANNEXE C.
Policy on Each Source of Supply.As regards the Professional Industry, the fullest encouragement must be given for expansion of production facilities in each case, an expansion only limited by considerations of efficiency of control and administration.Such expansion should be arranged on a variety of bases varying from normal expansion by the firms on their own account financially assisted expansion-new facilities paid for by the State and operated by the firm on behalf of the State.Unless under very exceptional circumstances, no encouragement should be given to the creation of entirely new parent units of a professional nature.As regards State Factories for classes of product for which such factories are essential, the policy should be to expand them in size and in number. Here care should be taken in location of new factories to ensure that ultimately they may take the place of the old plants now in real danger areas.The Policy for the Shadow Industry.The original conception of this was designed to deal with the planning in peace time for the turnover of Industry in War. Now, the demands of the present 3/5 years&apos; programmes involves not the planning of a shadow, but a substantial degree of creation of the reality behind the shadow.The general conception is that existing firms with good organisation who do. not manufacture warlike stores will be selected and invited to arrange for the manufacture of such stores, first, for the present emergency, and, secondly, on the outbreak of war. -It must be clearly appreciated that at this moment in most cases the pro-duction facilities of selected firms are busily employed on civil or export trade.In such cases, the firms will be invited to create new facilities on an agreed scale to enable them to produce for this emergency. They will also be asked to. prepare plans for utilising their existing facilities for producing warlike stores in the event of war.The particular circumstances will vary in connection with every firm and with different types of product and wide elasticity of arrangements must be provided for, but the underlying principle is that each selected, firm will agree to use its organisation and commercial structure to set up some measure of munition production and thus create the &quot; Shadow Industry.&quot;The simplest and most direct example might be as follows : The War Office Supply Department (with the approval of the Principal Supply Officers Organisation) will select an engineering firm and say to it: &quot; We desire you to utilise, rent or build sufficient factory floor space to house the facilities for producing X shell per week. We desire you to design a layout for the essential machinery and equipment. We wish you then to purchase and. obtain this equipment on the scale of Y per cent., capa,ble of producing Y per cent, of the ultimate war output, and we desire you to make the necessary tools, jigs and. fixtures. We then wish you to proceed with the execution of shell contracts at the Y per cent, rate to meet the present emergency and when these needs are met, we desire you to hold these buildings and equipment for the State on a care and maintenance basis. The State will pay you for all your outlays and will remunerate you for the supervising and operational functions which you have discharged on the basis of some form of fee or commission.&quot; The engineering firm will regard these facilities as State-owned, but operated by the firm as and when required by the State.A more complicated case will arise where the firm may already possess part of the necessary facilities and only require to instal what might be called &quot; balancing &quot; facilities.A further example might be where the firm might say that they possessed idle facilities at the moment which with a few balancing machines would enable them to actually accept a contract on more normal commercial lines.The Plan thus contemplates three sources of supply comprising the professional armament units and the State factories with their respective expansions and the &quot; Shadow Industries.&quot;There is an apparent inconsistency in regard to Aircraft supply, where the national policy up till now has been to encourage the whole expansion being
carried out by the professional industry. The reason for this is that in regard to aircraft it was felt that, first, the industry was a weak one out of keeping with national needs, and secondly, an industry with a definite civil future, and accordingly, it appeared wise to encourage its development now for military purposes in the knowledge that the expenditure would not be a national waste on account of future civil possibilities.However, the new programme of Air needs will necessitate even here some measure of application of the &quot; Shadow Scheme.&quot;Furthermore, it must be clear that the application of the &apos;&apos; Shadow Scheme &apos;&apos; may, in some cases, take place not only with selected non-armament firms, but also with units of the professional industry. There will arise some cases where a professional firm may be asked to lay down new production facilities in excess of its own legitimate aspirations, and the firm may be asked to create these and hold and operate them for the State.Co-operation and Collaboration with Industry.Success in this Plan can only be effective by the most direct contact and collaboration between the State Departments and Industry.In dealing with this, we have to think not only of industrial units having individual contact as direct suppliers with the Service Supply Departments, but also of those sections and units of industry who supply direct contractors with equipment, semi-finished and raw materials. The Machine Tool Industry, the Steel Industry and the makers of stampings and forgings are examples of this.British Industry is so complex that it is not organised as a whole in any really effective sense. On the other hand, through Federations and Trade Organisations it is fairly well organised in the different sections.Fortunately, the Plan has only two considerations which are sufficiently general as to even merit consideration of central handling.The first is the general goodwill of industry towards the Plan, and the second is the question of safeguards against excessive profits or prices.On both these points, it might be wise to meet a small and authoritative Committee of the Federation of British Industries and to give them a general picture of the Problem and the Plan, and thus evoke their goodwill. Perhaps on the general question of excessive prices, they might be able to make useful suggestions.The really effective and essential contact and collaboration must take place on lower rungs of the ladder.On all practical problems which arise, the contact must take place, as regards direct contractors, between them and the Supply Departments, and as regards secondary and ancillary sections of Industry with small Committees appointed within the sections, usually by the Trade Organisations.A few typical examples of such Committees and other essential contacts is annexed.With the Professional Industry contact will be direct with the individual unit as obtains to-day.With the selected firms under the Plan, the contact should also be direct.The essence of success will lie in making the contacts as direct as possible between the Supply Departments and Industry, considered either as units or in sections, and any further organisation arising out of the Plan should, so far as possible, be left to Industry to carry out.The State Side.So far as I can see, it will be wiser to develop and. adapt the existing supply machinery of the Services to handle the new problems rather than to attempt to create any new Central Government Supply Machine.Accordingly, the main executive responsibility for action and industrial contact must rest with the Supply Departments of the Services.It is for them to formulate their programmes quantitatively and qualitatively and to plan and negotiate with the various sources of production.In paragraph 92, the Report gives certain conditions essential for action under the Plan. The first is : &quot; Approval of a long-term programme of rearmament.&quot; I assume this Committee is now recommending to the Cabinet that approval be given to the Service programmes to the extent covered by decisions now being
taken by the Committee, and that the Services will then take action to implement the programmes.My investigation makes it clear that the task devolving on the War Office will be an exceptionally heavy and difficult one. The needs of the Admiralty will largely be met by their own Professional Contractors with whom their Supply and Contract procedure and practice is well established.The Air Ministry, although now faced with further new responsibilities,, have had some months of expansion experience and are adjusting their Supply practice to meet the new conditions.However, at the War Office, they have now to face an entirely novel task for which their Supply Machinery has not been designed, and, in my view, is quite-unsuitable. They have to undertake the task of turning the &quot; Shadow Plan &quot; in all its novelty into a reality.Paragraph 92 (d) says &quot;Greater recourse will be necessary to non-competitive contracts.. Generally, greater elasticity may be necessary in contract procedure.&quot;These remarks give an entirely insufficient and inadequate picture.My considered opinion is that there must come into existence at the War Office a Munitions Supply Department covering every phase of Supply, able not only to buy something which someone makes and desires to sell under normal commercial procedure, but a Department with sufficient technical, production, inspectional, commercial and financial experience, coupled with the spirit of &quot;drive,&quot; to enter into and settle promptly, effective business negotiations with, for example, 100 selected firms under which these firms will, mainly in a spirit of national service, create new and adapt existing facilities to enable them to supply highly technical products of which they have perhaps no previous experience. In addition to this, the Department must make the fullest use of the Professional sources of Supply and be responsible for the State Factories and their expansion.In my view, this is the crux as regards immediate constructive action. Somehow the War Office will have to adapt and rearrange its internal machinery so that it will have a Munitions Supply Department with a Head responsible for Munitions Supply in every phase, and responsible as a member of the Army Council to the Secretary of State for carrying out this programme.To this, I would add the recommendation that the existing full-time part of the Supply Board Organisation, which at the moment has as its main function the arrangements for war preparations, should, at least for a period, be associated with this new Munitions Supply Department of the War Office.Considtation and Collaboration with Labour.As with Industry, I suggest that consultation with Labour as a whole, involving a large conference with the Trades Unions, should be avoided as likely to create a crisis type of atmosphere.I recommend that reliance be placed on the good working of the Employers and Trades Union machinery which exists in the different sections of Industry and which provides for the fullest consultation on questions likely to arise. The emergence of real difficulties will be gradual and the fullest opportunity should be given to their settlement within the industries prior to any form of Government intervention.Co-ordination Avoidance of Departmental Competition Allocation of Firms -Priorities.These functions should be discharged by the P.S.O. organisation and the Supply Board.Priority Appeals. These should be dealt with by Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s Committee.Prevention of Excessive Profits.This is a danger from both the political and production standpoints.   The taxpayer must be conscious that his interest is safeguarded.   Labour must feel [12683] . d 2
that exploitation will not be permitted, and finally, the contractor in entering into new commitments must do so with the confidence and enthusiasm that he will also be given a square deal.The arrangement at the Air Ministry under which the Contracts Branch has associated with it a small Committee of well-known and experienced business men is probably the best system for dealing with the new conditions, and I endorse the recommendation of the Report that the Admiralty and War Office should adopt such a scheme.This system applies only to direct Departmental contracts, but in the sphere of ancillary and sub-contracts to which the State is not a party, the problem of control is much more difficult, and I doubt whether it is possible to meet the danger to the fullest extent.In the case, for example, of Steel or Machine Tools, I suggest that the Board of Trade and the Treasury should deal with the small Committee of their individual sections already referred to, and where there are no Committees, deal direct with the larger independent units, and invite them to suggest how these sections and units would themselves propose to control their own prices in the national interest.If this step is not successful, I confess my inability to suggest any further step, as any general action to be effective would mean full price control, a step which in peace time I would regard as quite impracticable.Financial Control.To achieve the programmes under the Report, the Supply Departments and contractors will be working against time. Decisions instructing new contractors to proceed with the creation of new facilities and prepare themselves for production must inevitably be given by the Technical Supply Staff prior to any meticulous settlement of the financial details.In this sense, the conditions are in some measure akin to War conditions. The word of the man responsible for Supply must carry, and the spirit and enthusiasm which he has evoked in the contractor^ mind must not be chilled by delays of approvals, caused by financial control. I do not mean that any loose disregard should prevail on the financial side, but the keynote must be that &quot; the job must go ahead.&quot; After this is secured, all the essential financial supervision can be properly initiated.Progress.The new enterprise launched by general approval of D.R.C. 37 is so vast as to call for continuous supervision of its progress in every phase, and the necessity of each Service holding weekly meetings to review progress and deal with difficulties which arise should be commended to them.Further, it would appear necessary that some arrangement be made under which the progress of each Service in regard to its programme should be reported, say, monthly to Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s Committee.The basis of all Progress Reports should come from a special Supplies Statistical Section set up in each of the Supply Departments, which will regularly relate promises with performance.General.At this stage, no one can assess definitely whether or not these programmes can be met in the time.Probably the Naval and Air needs can be met to a large extent, but the War Office needs, reduced though they may be by the decision of this Committee, still remain a doubtful problem.The War Office requirements necessitate the building up of new production facilities before output can commence on any real scale, and the fruits of this work can only be gathered in the later years of the period.The essential output rate can ultimately be achieved, but there will be serious deficits in the early stages.
All concerned should at every stage keep closely in their minds an apprecia-tion that the following major troubles will seriously affect the early stages of progress : (a) The training of skilled labour.(b) Securing reasonable efficiency in organisation and in production methods to avoid the waste and misuse of existing skilled labour.(c) Delays and frictions between contractors and Supply Departmentsarising out of technical and design difficulties, modifications and changes in design.In the case of Technical Supply, when the time factor is vital, it is most essential in formulating specifications to ensure that no design or type is adopted which has not been tested both in use and in production, and, however creditably anxious the Technical Departments may be to obtain supplies representing &quot; the last word in design,&quot; such a policy is generally associated with grave and irritating delays.The &apos;&apos; very latest&apos;&apos; is not possible when working against time.(Signed) WEIR.January 27, 1936.Appendix to Annexe C.Preliminary List of Sections of Industry with which Early Contact should beA rranged.Suggested Committees : Machine Tools.The President, Mr. W.

[I.P.C. 4.] ANNEXE D.Report of Sub-Committee on Industrial Production.1. THE Sub-Committee on Industrial Production of the Committee of Imperial Defence was appointed in accordance with Conclusion-xii of the Minutes of the 8th Meeting of the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements, held on the 30th January, 1936.   Its composition is as follows : The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman).The Lord President of the Council.The Secretary of State for Air.The President of the Board of Trade.Lord Weir.The Sub-Committee&apos;s terms of reference are :- &quot; To investigate the question of what arrangements should be made to provide against excessive profits being made by contractors, having regard to the political considerations (including the statement on the subject in the Government&apos;s General Election Manifesto), the importance of obtaining the goodwill of the contractors, and other factors in the problem.&quot;2. We understand that our inquiry is to deal only with the arrangements for the increased production of armaments contemplated during the next three to five years. We further understand that the principal question on Avhich our recommendations are desired is whether it is necessary that the Defence Depart-ments should have the right to inspect the books of armaments contractors; and, if so, whether that right should be secured by Act of Parliament or obtained by voluntary agreement.The sources &apos;of supply during the peHod of expansion.3. The sources of supply on which the Defence Departments will have to rely during the period of expansion are as follows : 1The State Factories. With these we are not concerned.The Professional Armament Industries, that is, the private industrial units whose regular business it is to supply the peace-time needs of the Services.The &quot; Shadow &quot; Industry, that is, the section of private industry which will be selected to instal and operate additional plant on behalf of the State during the next three to five years, and which will receive State payment for its outlay. We understand that it is intended to select existing firms with a good organisation, which do not normally manufacture warlike stores.Industry of mixed ownership, that is, cases where a &quot; shadow &quot; firm already possesses part of the necessary equipment, but will, need further equipment at the expense of the State.Ancillary industries acting as sub-contractors to the classes of industry already mentioned.The need for a right of inspection.4. The circumstances will be unique the State will be working against time, in conditions of great difficulty. The situation will be complicated by the number of sources of supply, by the impossibility of fixing prices in advance, by the difficulty of exercising control over sub-contractors, and by the necessarily non-competitive character of the arrangements. Difficulties have already been encountered in the comparatively restricted industrial field affected by the present expansion of the Royal Air Force, and these difficulties are certain to be multiplied in the case of the new contracts, which will make much wider demands on industry. Is there any alternative to a right of inspection which will provide against excessive profits while retaining the goodwill of manufacturers; and. further, will reassure public and Parliamentary opinion that excessive profits are not being made ?
In our view there is no doubt that it will be necessary for the Defence Departments to have the right to inspect books. Parliamentary considerations alone would be decisive in favour of this course.Statutory or voluntary right of inspection.5. It is less clear whether the right to inspect should rest on an Act of Parliament or should be obtained by voluntary agreement. A good case can be made out for statutory powers not that the law would be invoked in the majority of cases; it would remain in the background as an indication to firms that they would gain nothing by making difficulties over the inspection clauses of their contracts. On the other hand, it seems to us that the arguments for the voluntary method are more compelling. The expansion of armaments itself is to proceed on a peace footing; there is to be no declaration of a state of emergency, and no commandeering. Except for the limited part which can be played by the State factories, the plan will stand or fall by the voluntary co-operation of industry. It is imperative, then, that nothing should be done to offend industrialists or give them an excuse for declining to undertake the manufacture of armaments. If refusals were to occur on any considerable scale, as a result of statutory powers of inspection having been taken, the Government would suffer a loss of prestige, and the goods might not be obtained in time.6. The French and United States precedents do not appear to us, in so far as we have had time to examine them, likely to assist in the solution of our own difficulties.7. We recommend, then, that the right to inspect should not be obtained by Act of Parliament, but should be secured by the voluntary acceptance by firms of a suitable clause in their contracts. Acceptance of inspection should, where necessary, be made a sine qua non- of participation. We recommend also certain other non-statutory safeguards against excessive profits, as follows : -(a) The establishment of Committees of the Lever type at the War Office and Admiralty, associated with the Contracts Branches and acting as referees.(&amp;) In certain cases of articles difficult to price, a maximum price, with the addition of a costings clause and a referee :s decision.(c) No encouragement to be given to the creation of new professional armaments units.(d) The full development of the &apos;&apos; shadow &apos;&apos; scheme, all outlays being audited on behalf of the State by trade accountants.   No trouble should arise here, since the non-commercial portion of the books only will be inspected, and this is, in fact, the property of the State.(e) As regards sub-contractors, who will have no direct relationship with the State, a small committee should be set up by each large unit of industry affected, e.g., steel, machine tools, alloy steels, &amp;c.We do not think that it will be desirable for Departments to volunteer to these committees any definition of overcharging. The better plan will be to invite the committees themselves to make proposals for the control of prices. The terms -of reference of the committees might be on the following lines : &quot; A Committee representative of the industry, whose function it would be to insure that the Government Departments and their contractors are charged reasonable prices, and who would be prepared to justify to the Departments the prices charged.&quot;(/) A general assurance should be obtained from the Federation of British Industries that industry will control its own prices in the national interest and in a spirit of non-exploitation.We consider that the various non-statutory safeguards which we have set out should together constitute an effective scheme of precautions against excessive profits though we do not claim that no loop-holes can be discovered in it and we think that the scheme is likely to prove acceptable to Parliamentary and public opinion.
Summary of Recommendations.8.   Our recommendations to the Cabinet may be summarised as follows :  (i) In order to prevent the making of excessive profits during the contem-plated expansion in armaments of the next three to five years, it will be necessary that Defence Departments should have the right to inspect the books of all firms undertaking direct armament contracts.(ii) The right to inspect should not be statutory, but should be obtained bythe voluntary acceptance by firms of a suitable clause in their contracts. Acceptance of inspection should, where necessary, be made a sine qua non of participation, (iii) We recommend that further non-statutory precautions should be taken, as detailed in paragraph 7 of the present Report. In particular, as a safeguard against the making of excessive profits by sub-contractors, a committee should be set up by each large unit of industry affected, whose function it will be to insure that Government Departments and. their contractors are charged reasonable prices.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee : (Signed) N.

Note by the Chairman.IN forwarding the attached Report on Defence Requirements I am asked by my colleagues on the Sub-Committee to draw attention &quot;to a point which arises in connection with the recommendation in paragraphs 32-34 that the Government should adopt in principle a new standard of Naval strength enabling us to place a Fleet in the Far East fully adequate to act on the defensive and to serve as a strong deterrent against any threat to our interests in that part of the globe, and at the same time to maintain in all circumstances in Home Waters a force able to meet the requirements of a war with Germany.2. The point to which the Sub-Committee desire me to draw attention is the bearing of this new standard on the coming Naval Conference. It appears very doubtful whether the Government will have time to reach a decision on the subject before the Conference opens on the 6th December. In any event it would undoubtedly cause great difficulties in the Conference and militate against its success if, in the course of the proceedings, the United Kingdom Delegates were to announce an intention to increase our Naval strength.3. The United States Government has already been warned confidentially during the preliminary Conversations that it may be necessary for us to increase our rate of construction of Capital Ships owing to the uncertainties of the international situation, and that we now aim at a strength of 70 Cruisers.4. We consider that during the forthcoming Naval Conference it is vital to avoid any commitments as to the ultimate Naval strength at which we shall have to aim, in view of the continued uncertainties of the inter-national situation which may compel us at some later date to increase our strength in the various categories.5. That course would appear sufficient for the present, as, for reasons explained in the Report, material considerations prohibit the implementation of the new standard except to a very minor extent during the next three or four years.(Signed) M.

REPORT.I. Introduction explaining Terms of Reference.Our First Report (D.R.C. 14, also CP. 64 (34)) was submitted on the 5th March, 1934. It was examined in the first instance by the late Ministerial Committee on Defence Requirements. Their report, as approved by the Cabinet on the 31st July, 1934 (Cabinet 31 (34), Conclusion 1), cut down by half our proposals for meeting the Army&apos;s deficiencies, but greatly increased the programme of the Royal Air Force. Both the Naval construction programme and the Naval deficiencies programme were reserved, owing to uncertainties as to the International Naval Conference, and it was decided to deal with them for the moment in the normal course of the Annual Estimates. Subsequently, the anxiety created in the public mind at home and abroad as to the dangers resulting from the rapid creation of the German Air Force led to an acceleration of the Air Force programme in November 1934, and again in May 1935.2. By this time (May 1935) the international situation had further deteriorated, and consequently the defence programmes, particularly of the Navy and Army had become even less adequate to the defensive needs of the situation. In these circumstances the reconstituted Ministerial Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements appointed an ad hoc Sub-Committee to draft a Terms of Reference for a fresh Inquiry in the light of recent changes in the situation and with special reference to financial co-ordination.3. Shortly after this there was a rearrangement of the Cabinet, and the Ministerial Committee on Defence Requirements was replaced by the present (Ministerial) Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Defence Policy and Requirements, which, on the 8th July, after considering the Report of the Sub-Committee on Terms of Reference, gave us the following Terms of Reference : i -&quot; To re-examine, in the light of the situation set forth in Paper No. D.P.R. 6* and with special reference to financial co-ordination, the programmes of the Navy, Army and Air Force, and to make recommendations for the future.&quot;4. On the 24th July we submitted an Interim Report (D.P.R. 12, also D.R.C. 25) on this new reference, in which we made a preliminary survey of our defence requirements and of the international situation so far as it affects the question of defensive requirements, and at the same time asked for confirmation of our views and for further guidance before proceeding to work out in detail fresh programmes of defence requirements. This Report is attached for convenience of reference as an Annex. ......5. After considering our Interim Report, the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements formulated the following conclusions : &quot; . . .. . without committing themselves in principle either as to the date, or as to the method by which the programmes of the Defence Services were to be financed, and without any assumption that it might not be possible to improve the international situation, the Committee agreed (i) To authorise the Defence Requirements Sub-Committee to work out, for their consideration, programmes on the assumption that by the end of the financial year 1938-39 each Service should have advanced its state of readiness to the widest necessary extent in relation to the military needs of national defence and within the limits of practicability;(ii) The Sub-Committee, in their Report, should include answers to the following questions : (a) What special measures would be required for increasing factory output so as to provide the material required within the period named, and what would be the cost of those measures ?* Report of Sub-Committee on Terms of Reference.
(&amp;) If no such special measures were taken as regards factory output, what state of preparedness would we be able to achieve by,that date, or, alternatively, how long a period would be required to reach the same state of preparedness as in (a) above % (iii) That the eventual decision of the Cabinet regarding the programmes of the Services would have to be taken on the widest review of the existing international, financial and political considerations.&quot;6. The Conclusions set forth in paragraphs 3 and 5 above contain our Terms of Reference.II. The International Situation.7. The international situation in its effect on Defence requirements was described in paragraphs 4 to 14 of our Interim Report (D.R.C. 25, also D.P.R. 12) (Annex). The deterioration that was then taking place has continued. The position may be summed up thus. Germany is still re-arming at full speed, and rejoicing at the dissolution of the Stresa front. For both these reasons she is attracting more Powers into her orbit. She aims at, and may easily complete, a German-Polish-Hungarian-Bulgarian block. Yugoslavia, with whom Italy has failed to make terms, is being heavily courted by Germany but, while less attached to France, is keeping a middle position. Czechoslovakia and Austria are threatened at a date not yet assignable, and the desire for eastern expansion is maintained. Meanwhile Italy has become antagonistic and must necessarily emerge debilitated from the present crisis, whatever its solution. France, owing to M. Laval&apos;s weakness, has allowed herself to be rent by the wide divergence on foreign affairs between the right and left. She has consequently proved an unreliable collaborator at Geneva, because she cannot count on her own people except in the case of an attempted invasion, or some event that clearly threatened France directly  not indirectly. The United States are more isolationist at heart than ever before. Japan means to dominate the Far East, as Germany means, to dominate Europe. We must, of course, employ all the resources of diplomacy to avoid ruptures anywhere, to improve relations everywhere, but the fact remains that we are living in a world more dangerous than it has ever been before, that we can count on no one but ourselves unless we are strong.8. To one of the features mentioned, above we must draw particular attention.   In paragraph 6 of our Interim Report we stated : &quot; Meanwhile the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia threatens to weaken the unity of the nations that can hold German ambitions in check. It is to be apprehended also that, as German strength increases, there will be a tendency for her to attract satellite nations into her orbit and away from the other Powers. Examples of this tendency are already to be found in the case of Poland and, to a lesser extent, Yugoslavia.&quot;9. These tendencies have been accentuated by the development of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute into a state of open war, by the rift between Italy and the League of Nations, by the resulting tension between Italy and this country, by the application of sanctions, and by the strain that has been put on our relations with France. Owing to these events the unity of the nations that can hold Germany in check has been seriously weakened. In addition, as already mentioned, the tendency of Germany, as she becomes palpably stronger, to attract satellite nations continues. To this must be added the fact that the necessity of concentrating in the Mediterranean for defensive purposes a large proportion of our very limited forces has not only left us exposed, temporarily at any rate, both in the West and in the Far East, but has also tended to focus attention upon the degree of our weakness.The Effect of Collective Security on Defence Questions.10. ^ Apart from these considerations, the development of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, especially when considered in conjunction with the earlier Manchurian episode, has brought to the front a difficulty which, though not wholly
unforeseen, has hitherto not been taken into account in calculating our defence requirements, namely, the extent of our possible commitments as a world-wide Power under the system of collective security provided for by the Covenant, and the suddenness with which they are liable to arise.11. In the past it has been our practice to frame our defensive requirements on deductions made from an annual study of the international situation. This system was stretched to extreme limits by the adoption after the late war of the assumption that there would be no major war within ten years from any given date, which from 1928 was made more drastic and, in effect, meant that for many years our defensive preparations remained at a standstill. That complacent assumption was rudely shaken in the West by ominous signs of a renaissance of armaments in Germany, and in the East by the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and Shanghai and the events at Geneva from 1931 to 1933. Such emergency defensive arrangements as were possible had to be improvised at short notice to meet the needs of a dangerous situation in the Far East, the Ten-Year Assumption was cancelled, and the defensive preparations which by any comparative standards had been virtually abandoned while it was in operation were half-heartedly resumed. The Manchurian episode resulted in the withdrawal of Japan from the League of Nations and in a further deterioration (that had originated in 1923) in our relations with that country which we have not yet succeeded in removing.12. After the disappearance of the Ten-Year Assumption we were left with our traditional and too optimistic system of excluding from our calculations those Great Powers with which we had no present or prospective difficulties likely to create serious tension. On the 15th November, 1933, the Cabinet, on the recommendation of the Committee of Imperial Defence, decided that &quot; No expenditure should for the present be incurred on measures of defence required to provide exclusively against attack by the United States,, France, or Italy.&quot;&apos; (Cabinet 62 (33),&apos; Conclusion 5 : C.I.D. 261st Meeting, Minute 1.)13. That decision has never been rescinded and was still operative when we were given our new Terms of Reference as recently as the 8th August last. Within a week or two of that date we were compelled to improvise military precautions on an extended scale to meet the very contingency of attack by Italy which had been excluded from our calculations. This episode confirms the repeated warnings of the Chiefs of Staff, supported by historical illustrations, of the suddenness with which wars and crises are apt to arise.*14. This is not the occasion to discuss, from the point of view of either international morality or national security, the merits of the League system of collective security, which, since the War, has been adopted by every Government of this country, with the general support of public opinion. The system is on trial at this moment and, unless it succeeds, at least partially, will, we presume, be reconsidered. But we feel bound to bring to notice the very serious effect of the system, in its present stage, on our own defence requirements, as illustrated by the Manchurian and Abyssinian episodes.15. Our experience of the incalculable danger to our national and imperial security involved in a fully armed and militarist Germany provides overwhelming reasons for avoiding any further estrangement either of Japan (the treaty with whom we unfortunately had to abandon), or of any Mediterranean Power which lies athwart our main artery of communication to the East. Least of all could we contemplate without the gravest misgiving an estrangement with Japan and a Mediterranean Power at once. Yet, in both the Manchurian and Abyssinian affairs our policy to some extent passed out of our control by reason of our engagements to the League of Nations. Prior to 1914 we were free agents. In 1894 we could view the Japanese invasion of Corea with unconcern; we refused to join in the pressure put on Japan by Russia, France and Germany to abate her demands on China after her victory ;t and we were wise enough to conclude the first Anglo-Japanese Alliance seven years after that war.   In 1911 we could disinterest ourselves in the Italian invasion of* e.g. C.I.D. Paper No. 1082-B.f The Gooch-Temperley Documents, Vol. II, page 89.
7Tripoli, the first serious war between European Powers since 1877. But in 1932-33, and again in 1935, owing to our obligations under the Covenant and the position we occupy as the one great Sea-Power remaining in the League, we had no alternative but to play our part inevitably a leading part; in disputes in which our national interest was at most quite secondary, even if it be true that young Italy has long been jealous of our Mediterranean position and potentially , hostile to this country. On each occasion we have come within sight of war and aroused the bitterness of old friends and allies, including, in the recent past, not only Italy, but even France, hitherto our closest but not always reliable friend.The Relationship between Foreign Policy and Defence.16. We consider it to be a cardinal requirement of our national and imperial security that our foreign policy should be so conducted as to avoid the possible development of a situation in which we might be confronted simultaneously with the hostility, open or veiled, of Japan in the Far East, Germany in the West, and any Power on the main line of communication between the two. So far as Japan is concerned, in our previous Report we emphasized strongly the importance of an ultimate policy of accommodation and neighbourliness with that country. Recent events accentuate the desirability of that policy, difficult though it may be to carry out.17. The establishment of friendly relations with Germany on a durable basis, while equally desirable strategically, presents difficulties which are even greater than in the case of Japan. This object might founder on Germany&apos;s restless desire for expansion, either to the East or South-East in Europe, or by the acquisition of colonies, or both. If either of these ambitions were to be conceded or condoned by a Government in this country, widespread opposition and division of public opinion may be anticipated. The former case would, indeed, be wholly incompatible with our membership of the League, or with the existence of the League. Nevertheless, we see every advantage in keeping our relations with Germany on as friendly a basis as possible. Herr Hitler has on several occasions affirmed his desire for friendly relations, and by concluding the recent Naval Agreement he has given to it some practical expression. In view of the urgent need of peace and the grave dangers to which this country, its Capital and the whole Empire, would be exposed in the event of a breach of the peace in Western Europe, to say nothing of the danger of its extension to the Far East, we consider that we should respond as favourably as circumstances permit though circumstances are likely to impose a concrete limit to Herr Hitler&apos;s attitude, and do everything we can, in conjunction with France, to promote and maintain friendly relations with Germany. It is possible, especially if M. Laval remains in power, that France may attempt to force the pace in this respect. The subject is at least one to be borne constantly in mind, though it bristles with practical difficulties, both internal and external.18. So far as Italy is concerned it would be premature to forecast what is likely to develop from present events; how long Italian resentment will endure after an exhausting war; in what kind of condition the country will emerge; whether the Italians, who are complete opportunists and will take without scruple the course that suits them best at the moment, will wish to return to the League and the Franco-British group or to gravitate towards Germany; or whether the Germans, who are more formidable realists, will go out of their way to bring within their orbit a nation, probably in an exhausted condition and one of whose doubtful reliability they have bitter experience. These matters are beyond calculation, but, from the point of view of Imperial Defence, we would urge that, before Italy can again become a formidable factor, our long-range policy should be so aligned that we can never get into a position where we would not have a certainty of French military support in the event of war with Japan and Italy at the same time, and a fortiori if we were involved simultaneously with Germany and Japan. This, however, is, of course, subject to the reservations on the weakness of France, as explained in paragraph 7, and of the unreliability that always flows from division and can only be corrected by an increase in our own strength.
The Need for increasing our Defensive A armaments.19. From the above observations one fact stands out pre-eminently. Whatever means we adopt to forward our main policy of preserving peace, there is no alternative to our raising our armaments to a far more effective standard than they will attain when existing approved programmes are completed. Our defence forces must not only be strong enough but must be ready to meet an emergency such as the one that arose so suddenly this summer, for graver ones may come and come shortly.20. These are urgent necessities, whether viewed from the standpoint of the past, the present or the future. Had we been reasonably strong at sea in 1931-33 our influence with Japan would have been much greater than it was, and we might have averted that defiance of the League of Nations which has provided so unfortunate an example to Germany and Italy. Had we been reasonably strong, Germany might well have hesitated before re-arming in breach of the &apos; Treaty of Versailles. If we had been less weak to-day it is almost certain that Italy would never have dared to set herself against the public opinion of the world and would have responded to the Paris peace offers; and, even if Italy had remained obdurate, France (feeling more assurance about England and therefore less dependent on Italian support) would have been willing from the first to play her proper part in defending the Covenant of the League instead of being split from top to bottom on the question of sanctions, and breaking out into anti-British manifestations.21. Looking to the future, a strong Britain is no less essential to the peace of the world. If the policy of collective security contained in the Covenant survives the present test, it is certain that it can only succeed under the leadership of a re-equipped Britain. As the Japanese, German and Italian incidents show, the United Kingdom alone among the more powerful States Members of the League is so placed as to be able to give whole-hearted expression to the moral ideals underlying the Covenant: expression (be it noted), but owing to our weakness, not effect. We can secure the plaudits of the smaller nations who are at a safe distance from the centres of disturbance, but we cannot be sure of obtaining the active material and moral support of the larger nations which, acting together, alone can provide that overwhelming deterrent to war that lies in the background of the Covenant, because they know, and have long known, that we lack the power to support our words effectively by deeds. With a strong Britain the League would.be a far more effective instrument for the maintenance of peace, and as a deterrent to war. If we fail, moreover, to provide this strength, we cannot exclude particularly if we embark on further forward policies the possibility of a European combination against us.22. As we see it, there are four possible policies on which to base our international relationships : (i) Adherence to the system of collective security provided for in theCovenant of the League of Nations; (ii) A more limited system of collective security on the Locarno model;(iii) The pre-war system of alliances and ententes; or(iv) Isolation.We have already shown that the leadership of a strong Britain is essential to the success of the Covenant system. If the Covenant fails and we are driven back on some other and more limited system of collective security or alliance, our co-operation will only be desired to such extent as we are recognised to be both strong and ready. Like Germany we shall attract satellite nations in proportion to our strength, and so increase our influence for peace. Either of the first three systems, therefore, demands strong defence forces on our part and needless to say an isolationist policy, if anyone still had leanings that way, would require the greatest strength of all.23. Hence, the lesson we draw from recent events is the paramount necessity, whatever our policy in the future, for making ourselves sufficiently strong to enable us to take our full share in maintaining the peace of the world and so to preserve ourselves, in the hope that a time may ultimately come when mutual reductions of armaments by consent may become possible without upsetting the equilibrium.   That time, however, is not yet.
III. Defence Requirements (General).24. From the previous section of this Report it will be seen that important new factors have been introduced into Imperial Defence. Formerly, if a war of the first magnitude was brewing, it was usually possible to foresee it and to take the necessary precautions. But if a war is brought into sight owing to the operation of collective security, the crisis is apt to arise with very little warning, as illustrated by the Manchurian and Abyssinian episodes, and as may in the future happen in the case of, e.g., Austria. It is almost impossible to forecast the nations with which we might be brought into conflict owing to a breach of the Covenant and still more impossible to forecast those on whose material support we could count. If the Covenant breaker were Germany, that support would be even less reliable than in the present case. And if we were to become embroiled in war on behalf of, or as a consequence of the action of, the League of Nations, it might be that one or other of our vital world-wide interests became exposed, as at the present time. It is also difficult to calculate what the compo-sition of our naval, military and air forces should be, as no reasonable warning of the conditions under which we might have to operate can be given.25. Consequently there arise three completely new considerations in the situation :- (a) As the result of the principle of collective security we must be moreinstantly ready for war than before.(b) There is from now onwards the possibility of a hostile Italy on our mainline of communications.(c) As the one big Naval Power of the League we may have to exhaustourselves to the detriment of the balance of security against Japan and Germany, who are outside it.To these must be added a fourth new consideration affecting the Navy exclusively:  (d) As a result of the resumption by Germany of the right to build up a newNavy free of the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles, the Navy of that country (though fortunately now limited by agreement to 35 per cent, of our own strength) has to be taken into account.And although there has been a partial recognition of the implications of air attack, we are more than justified in regarding the following as a fifth new consideration : (e) In view of the enormously increased output capacity of Germany, thereis the possibility of attack so continuous and concentrated and on such a scale that a few weeks of such an experience might so undermine the morale of any civilian population as to make it difficult for the Government to continue the war.26. The remedy of the deficiencies of the three Defence Services as contemplated in this Report will meet the first of these new considerations by rendering more possible rapid mobilisation and concentration wherever our forces are required.27. As indicated above in paragraph 18, the significance of the second consideration is impossible to appraise as yet, as it depends upon future develop-ments subsequent to Italy&apos;s Abyssinian adventure. For the present her eventual political orientation remains a matter of conjecture. Much will depend on the degree of her exhaustion after the present venture, for on this, of course, will depend the degree of the rancour of an opportunist State. Much will also depend on how far France recovers from her present outbreak of angry irreso-lution. We shall have to make the best of her, and in the last resort France needs our support so much for her own security vis-a-vis Germany that, provided we are strong, she may recover her perspective. We must recognise, however, that Anglo-French co-operation against aggression by Italy has been shown to be dubious, and we must not under-estimate Italian capacity for mischief if we were in conflict with Germany, and Italy joined in on the German side.28. Our defence requirements are so serious that it would be materially impossible,  within   the  period  With  which   this   Report   deals,   to  make
additional provision for the case of a hostile Italy. We take the view, therefore, that, for the moment at any rate, it is neither urgently necessary nor feasible to make provision for the contingency of a permanently hostile Italy, especially if, as suggested above in paragraph 18, an appropriate policy can be pursued in the international field in order to counter this.29. It will in any event be necessary to watch the situation carefully and to make a close study of the Mediterranean strategical problem. But for the above reasons we have limited ourselves for the present to the same hypotheses as in our first Report (D.R.C. 14, also CP. 64 (34)), namely, the provision of an adequate deterrent to Germany and. Japan, and a protection to the United Kingdom and the rest of the Empire in the eventof war with these countries.30. Even when the problem is limited to these hypotheses, however, new factors have arisen, particularly so far as the Navy is concerned. Since 1932 the standard of naval strength has, for practical purposes, been based on the following formula : &quot;We should be able to send to the Far East a Fleet sufficient to provide &apos;cover&apos; against the Japanese Fleet: we should have sufficient additional forces behind this shield for the protection of our territory and mercantile marine against Japanese attack : at the same time we should be able to retain in European waters a. force sufficient to act as a deterrent and to prevent the strongest European Naval Power from obtaining. control of our vital Home terminal areas while we can make the necessary redispositions.&quot; (N.C.M. (35) 12.)So long as Germany was bound by the Treaty of Versailles it may have been safe to assume a situation in which the &quot; necessary redispositions &quot; could be made to meet an emergency arising out of difficulties with Germany while still main-taining a strong defensive in the Far East. This is now more difficult as a result of the resumption by Germany of the right to build up a new Navy free of the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles, and the Navy of that country has to be taken into very definite account. By 1942 Germany, it is calculated, will have afloat 5 new capital ships in addition to 3 Deutschlands (the &quot; Pocket Battleships &quot;), and Japan will probably have completed 2 new capital ships. Even by the 31st March, 1939, Germany will have 3 Deutschlands and 2 new 26,000-ton. battle cruisers; if there was a serious emergency in the Far East we should have no margin of security in the event of a threatening situation in the West, even assuming superior fighting efficiency.31. We cannot over-emphasise the difficulties of conducting naval warfare against highly efficient enemies in two theatres so widely separated. The present troubles with Italy, which have necessitated the concentration in the Mediterranean of naval forces from all over the world, including the Far East, afford, some slight indication. But it would be suicidal folly to blind our eyes to the possibility of a simultaneous or practically simultaneous threat on both fronts; and if we do not possess forces sufficient to provide a deterrent this double emergency is the more likely to occur. If there is danger from Japan at all, it reaches its maximum from the point of view both of probability and extent when we are preoccupied in Europe. Unless we can provide a sufficient defence for that emergency, Australia, New Zealand, India, Burma, the rich Colonies East of Suez and a vast trade will be at their mercy, and the Eastern half of the British Empire might well be doomed.32. In the circumstances we recommend the new formula set forth in para-graph 34, which states more effectively than the one quoted in paragraph 30 that our standard of naval strength should cover both the two contingencies mentioned. Further, we consider that, as soon as is materially possible, our naval strength to carry out the formula ought to be calculated on a wider margin of safety; for hitherto our margin has been illusory, and we are now confronted with the prospect of an increase in the naval strength of our potential enemies, while in any event nations contemplating an aggression will naturally select the moment when they are at their maximum numerical strength and we, perhaps, at our average. , ;
33. Unfortunately, for reasons which are given later in Section IV, it is not possible to bring the Navy even to the present standard by the 31st March, 1939, or for some years thereafter, partly owing to the Naval Treaties, and partly to the difficulty of increasing the personnel and material to a sufficient extent within three years. Even in later years the situation will depend on the results of any international naval arrangement that may be entered into in substitution of the existing Treaties; but, subject to this, we think that every effort should be made to achieve the requisite standard.Standards of Security aimed at.34. The standards of security which we believe to be necessary may be summarised briefly as follows :-In the case of the Navy.We should aim at a new standard of naval strength defined as follows : (i) To enable us to place a Fleet in the Far East fully adequate to act on the defensive and to serve as a strong deterrent against any threat to our interests in that part of the globe.(ii) To maintain in all circumstances in Home Waters a force able tomeet the requirements of a war with Germany at the same time.Included in (i) and (ii) would be the forces necessary in all parts of the world, behind the cover of the main fleets, to protect our territories and merchant ships against sporadic attacks.In the case of the Army.(i) To maintain garrisons overseas on the present general basis for purposesof Imperial Defence.(ii) To provide for the military share in Home Defence, which includesanti-aircraft defence, Coast Defence and internal security.(iii) To enable us to provide reinforcements and/or a Field Force from home in time of emergency or war, with adequate equipment and reserves.Under (i) and (ii) the most important requirements substantial improvement in coast defences at Naval bases at Home and Abroad, and the completion of the Army&apos;s share in the Air Defence of Great Britain.Under (iii) the most important requirement is to organise a Field Force which can be sent abroad at short notice for the protection of our vital interests, and to enable us to honour our international obligations, particularly under the Treaty of Locarno, which would involve effective co-operation with other signatories on the Continent of Europe. This includes the occupation for our-selves and the denial to the enemy of advanced air bases in the Low Countries.In the case of the Air Force.We regard as a minimum the strength already decided for the Royal Air Force at Home, viz., 123 squadrons (1,512 first-line aircraft) to be completed by April 1937. This figure was based on the assumption that by that date the number of German first-line aircraft will amount to some 1,500,, In the absence of any agreement for the limitation of air forces there is, however, no guarantee that she will not build up to an even higher figure of first-line strength. It is therefore vital that the position should be kept under the closest continuous review.In addition we propose :- (i) Provision of war reserves, without which the Air Force could only fight for a very short time.(ii) Strengthening of the air forces overseas and, in particular, those required to meet the possibility of war with Japan in the Far East..(iii) Additions to the Fleet Air Arm to correspond to the naval programme.(iv) Additions to the Army Co-operation Squadrons (mainly auxiliarysquadrons) to provide the requirements of the four contingents of the Field Force. -
For all three Services.An effective scheme for the expansion of industry in time of war and the provision of reserves of war material sufficient to maintain them from the outset of war until industry is able to supply their needs from current output.35. The financial aspects of these proposals are discussed in Section IX. For the moment it is sufficient to state that they would result in an increased annual expenditure over the  124 millions (original Estimates) voted for the three Defence Services in 1935 of the order of  49,650,000 in 1936,  86,750,000 in 1937,  102,400,000 in 1938,  88,450,000 in 1939, and  90,050,000 in 1940. In other words, an increased expenditure, compared to the 1935 rate, of about  239,000,000 in the next three years and a further  178,500,000 in the following two years. In addition, there is a proposed increase in the Home Office vote of  1,847,000 a year, for each of the next three years, for Air Raids Precautions equipment; and a recommendation that increased provision should be made for Secret Service work up to  500,000 per annum.All estimates contained in this Report are given with the utmost reserve and are liable to substantial alteration in the light of experience.36. The summary given in paragraph 34. above is only intended to convey some idea of the general scheme for Imperial Defence as a whole before describing the requirements of each of the Defence Services to enable the plan to be implemented. The Sections which follow, namely, IV (Navy), V (Army), VI (Air Force), VII (War Production) and VIII (Miscellaneous), contain fuller particulars. Schedules I, II, III, IV and V, which were prepared by the Departments concerned for the use of our Committee, contain a good deal of further detail.IV. Navy Programme and Requirements.(For details, see Schedule I.)(a) Programme.Basis of the Construction Programme.37. In paragraph 34 above we recommend that the standard of naval strength should be increased so as to render it adequate to protect our interests simultaneously against Japan in the Far East and Germany in Europe. It must take a certain time to work out this standard, as it is dependent largely on the probable programmes of other Powers, as to which more information may be available after the coming Naval Conference. It is accordingly not possible for us to make concrete proposals in connection with such a standard at the moment. Still less is it possible to increase the Navy to the new standard within the period of three years with which this Report is primarily concerned for the reasons given below.The Difficulties of Rapid Expansion.38. The limiting factors in a rapid expansion of the Fleet are twofold, namely, those of (i) material, and (ii) personnel.39. The material difficulties are due, firstly, to the large amount of leeway to be caught up, which is strikingly illustrated later in the case of capital ships, and, secondly, to the diminution in our national industrial resources for armament work resulting from the relatively small naval orders in recent years combined with the almost complete disappearance of foreign orders. In these circumstances the Admiralty, within the next three years, cannot do much more in naval construction than commence the replacement of over-age and out-of-date ships in order to bring the Navy abreast of the existing approved standard quoted in paragraph 30.40. Apart from this, it would not be possible to raise and train the naval personnel required to man additional new ships. Even to comply with the requirements of the existing approved standard, a large addition to the personnel
of the Fleet is required (as described below in paragraph 58), and further increases could not be made, in the opinion of the Admiralty, without serious loss of efficiency.41. If it were decided to make a large increase in the size of the Navy within the next few years, it would be necessary to resort, so far as both material and personnel are concerned, to extraordinary measures, such as those adopted in the case of the Royal Air Force expansion. Anxious though they are to reach the new standard as early as possible, the Admiralty wish to avoid methods which, in their opinion, would prejudice the efficiency of the Service.42. There is, however, one step that can usefully be taken to expedite naval construction generally, namely, to lay down ships earlier in the year. In recent years, for reasons of economy, the practice has grown up of laying down ships in the last quarter of the financial year. We strongly recommend that during the next few years ships should be laid down as early as possible in the financial year.Immediate Policy.43. In the above circumstances it is clear that during the next three years we cannot make much progress towards the new standard of naval strength proposed in paragraph 34. For the time being we must concentrate on the requirements of the existing standard, doing ail we can at the same time to prepare for a fresh programme designed to bring the Navy up to the new standard if it is approved by the Government.44. Although the situation as to any international agreement on the size of Fleets is not yet clear, we recommend that the Government should at once adopt the new standard in principle and instruct the Admiralty (i) to work out the naval programme required to give effect to it as soon asthe necessary data are available; and (ii) to make suggestions as to any items in the new programme that can be put in hand before the expiration of the next three years.  These will probably be limited by material considerations to the smaller classes of warship.45. In the meanwhile, we wish to make it clear that the naval construction set forth in this Report and summarised below is limited to the existing approved standard of naval strength as set forth in paragraph 30.Capital Ships.46. The programme of capital ship construction proposed by the Admiralty, in which we concur, involves laying down 7 ships in the period 1937-39 inclusive (2 3 2). This replacement programme will provide equality in new ships with Germany and Japan, on the important assumption that Japan does not start building at a greater rate than has been assumed by the Admiralty.47. The high rate of replacement for the years 1937-39 has been forced on the Admiralty by the London Naval Treaty, which precluded the building of new capital ships in the last five years and thus rendered impossible a steady replace-ment of out-of-date vessels. After the completion of the ships laid down in 1937-39 (approximately by 1942) the more immediate necessities of capital ships will have been met, and, after one more year with two ships, it may be possible to revert to a normal rate of replacement, provided that no new factors arise. For example, after 1940 it would only be necessary to lay down one capital ship a year for normal replacement purposes, but this would have to be exceeded if Japan or Germany should lay down more ships than the Admiralty at present anticipate. Further, if the quantitative restrictions of the Naval Treaties on capital ship construction are not renewed in any form, it is possible that Japan, apart from new construction, may retain old ships that would have been scrapped under the provisions of the Naval Treaties and thus increase her total of capital ships. In that event, it will be necessary for the Admiralty to go further than is at present contemplated in the modernisation of our older capital ships in order to maintain the balance, and to provide some reasonable margin as is necessary
for the new standard we now propose, if it is adopted by the Government. For these reasons the situation must, in any case, be carefully watched in case, after 1940, a larger capital ship programme than one capital ship a year may be requisite.Aircraft Carriers.48. In aircraft carriers, the Admiralty propose to lay down 4 carriers (some of a smaller type) within the period 1936-42.i&apos;vV-v:-: &apos; - &apos; .        &apos;i   -       -.&apos; -   - :r:&apos;:        &apos; - &apos; &quot;M  .       -MISSIS feliffiCruisers.49. The ultimate number of cruisers to be aimed at must depend, to some extent, upon construction in Japan and Germany, but we are of the opinion that for the time being it is sufficient to adopt the Admiralty&apos;s cruiser replacement programme, which involves the building of 5 ships a year between 1936 and 1939. In the unlikely event of Treaty restrictions comparable with those at present in force still existing, the future programme could be reduced to 1 replacement cruiser per annum for a few years. Otherwise, however, and in any event if the new standard of naval strength is adopted, it will probably be necessary to continue at a higher rate and also to retain more over-age vessels.Destroyer Leaders and Destroyers.50. For some years now a steady replacement programme of destroyers has been proceeding at the rate of one flotilla a year. In view of the large numbers of destroyer leaders in several foreign navies, we learn with great satisfaction of the recent Cabinet decision to increase this year&apos;s approved building programme by 7 flotilla leaders of a special type. The Admiralty contemplate laying down a further flotilla of these vessels in the financial year 1936-37. After this programme only one more new flotilla will remain to complete the present approved total of 12 under-age flotillas. The Admiralty proposals consequently only visualise the laying down of a flotilla in alternate years up to 1942 which will complete our strength unless an increase of our total destroyer strength is decided upon. An increased programme of these vessels will be required if the Govern-ment decide to adopt the higher standard of naval strength recommended in paragraph 34.Submarines, Sloops and Small Craft.51. As regards other construction, for instance, submarines, sloops, other small craft and auxiliaries, to maintain our present strength it will be necessary to continue at the rate which has been carried out in the past, that is to say, for submarines about 3, and for sloops about 5 or 6 a year.Cost.52. It will be seen from Schedule I, Appendix 6, that the construction programme involves an expenditure of approximately  19^ million in 1936, rising to a peak of  36^ million in 1939. If quantitative international restrictions similar to those at present in force under the Naval Treaties are renewed, the cost of new construction will drop considerably in subsequent years. With no such restrictions, it must be assumed that the cost may be increased and continue high, more especially if the new standard of naval strength is adopted. The above figures do not, of course, represent a net addition. In a normal replacement year calculated on the present strength of the Fleet and the life of the various classes of ships, the new construction Vote would amount to some  16-^ million. The figure has only been below this in recent years ( 11 million in 1935) because capital ship replacement has been deferred.53. The additional cost now proposed over that which was put forward in our previous Report (D.R.C. 14, also CP. 64 (34)) is due firstly to the more rapid rate of replacement rendered necessary by more recent estimates of German and Japanese programmes, and secondly to the issue of the preliminary Naval
Conversations over the, last year which leave no doubt that owing to the attitude of the United States of America we are unlikely to secure international agreement to reduce the present maximum size of capita! ships and cruisers.54. If the above building proposals are adopted, on the 31st March, 1939, the figures for naval strength for the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan will be as follows : Completed Ships.Class of Ship.

(&quot;) Assumes about 17 submarines not yet over-age are scrapped prematurely to comply with London Naval Treaty.(b) Deficiencies.55. We concur in the Admiralty proposals for making good deficiencies, and the necessary provision has, as far as practicable, been inserted in the programme years 1936, 1937 and 1938. There remains, however, unavoidably a certain residue which it would not be possible to make good in these years; and of a total of approximately  29 million required some  4f million is left to be met subse-quent to 1939. The deficiencies dealt with include the modernisation of capital ships, anti-submarine equipment, reserves of ammunition, stores. &amp;c, and, in consequence of the fact that on this occasion we are reporting upon the total requirements, as against those only needed merely to make good the worst deficiencies, the Admiralty Estimates necessarily exceed those contained in our last Report. This is particularly the case with the modernisation of capital ships. Subsequent to the estimate put forward in Paper No. D.R.C. 14 (CP. 64 (34) ) information received as to the extent of modernisation of these ships by other Powers has shown that considerable extra work was necessary on our own ships if they were to be comparable with those of the Powers concerned.56. Complete modernisation is proposed for three of our capital ships, and partial for 4 more. The Nelson, Rodney and Hood will not require modernisation. If quantitative restrictions on the lines of the international agreements are continued after 1936, the Admiralty do not suggest modernising the remaining 5 capital ships. On the other hand, as we have already mentioned, if no such restrictions continue and other Powers retain their older ships when they have completed their new construction, it may be necessary to take in hand our remaining capital ships for modernisation in order to maintain the requisite superiority. Details of the deficiency proposals are contained in Ajppendix 2 to Schedule I, and the estimates there do not include the modernisation of the 5 ships referred to above. ; .     .   &apos; &apos;
57. We draw attention in particular to the new Item 17 of Appendix 2 to Schedule I for the immediate construction of a further Boys&apos; Training Establish-ment. This is of the utmost importance if the future naval personnel requirements are to be met.Personnel.58. The figures for personnel are given in Appendix 3 to Schedule I and they provide, in general, for an expansion of strength by some 35,600 spread over the years 1936-42. The Admiralty are reluctant, for reasons of efficiency, to shorten the period within which this personnel should be provided and, as already mentioned, this affects the rate at which ship replacment can be usefully under-taken. The desirability of shortening the period of training, however j will be kept in view. These increases, in conjunction with those already made in 1934 and 1935, result in an annual charge of  820,000 in 1936, rising ultimately to an annual total direct charge of over  6^ million.Fleet Air Arm.59. The cost of aircraft for new construction has been included in the Naval Construction Programme, and the Admiralty&apos;s proposals contained in Appendix 4 to Schedule I cover the provision of aircraft for the new carriers and for re-armament Or completion of existing flights; and also for the maintenance of the Fleet Air Arm during the period of expansion. The proposals are spread over the years 1936-42, mainly for the purpose of keeping in step with new construction, and the total required in these years amounts to  28 million. Maintenance of the whole Fleet Air Arm by that time will have trebled itself as compared with 1936 and will amount in 1942 to  3 million per annum.60. The first-line Fleet Air Arm strength allowed for in our proposals will amount to 504 aircraft by 1942. The need for the increase in the strength of the Fleet Air Arm from the present figure of 190 is clear when the present relative strengths of the principal Naval Powers is considered.Aircraft Embarked in Carrier and Catapult Ships.1935. 1939 (anticipated).United Kingdom ...      ...      ...      190 357U.S.A.      ...      ...      ......      403 670*Japan.........      ...      258      &apos;      374*The above numbers do not include aircraft in operational shore-based units capable of carrying out sea reconnaissance and other duties in co-operation with naval forces. Differences of air organisation as between United Kingdom, U.S.A. and Japan respectively preclude exact statistical comparisons in respect of this category of units. But it is observed that U.S.A. have 170 and Japan has 182 first-line aircraft of this nature. It is to be noted that the latter country has great advantage in the North China Sea, where she could make use not only of ship-borne aircraft, but also of shore-based aircraft working from islands in her possession. We possess a certain number of units which are so located that they are able to co-operate with the Naval forces in various areas, but it is clear that we are at present definitely inferior in numbers of aircraft in coastal units, both to the U.S.A. and to Japan. Our position in this respect will, however, be improved by the present Air Force Expansion Scheme and by the proposals in this Report. Moreover, the Admiralty propose to discuss with the Air Ministry means whereby our position in this respect may be further improved, particularly in respect of mobility (see paragraph 81 below).61. These increases in the strength of the Fleet Air Arm and its ever growing naval importance will necessarily require more shore accommodation for maintenance and training, and the Admiralty, in Schedule I, paragraph 10 (d), have drawn attention to their opinion that a Fleet Air Arm base ashore is a* These are figures anticipated for 1938, no figures for 1939 being available.
vital requirement for the efficiency of the Fleet Air Arm, and they have tentatively mentioned a figure of  5 million for that purpose. This is not, however, included in the summary of the Naval estimates of cost, and is a matter for discussion between the Admiralty and Air Ministry, whose own Estimates, it may be observed, include considerable ( 2 million) provision for additional shore accommodation for the Fleet Air Arm:Possible New Mediterranean Base.62. The Admiralty (paragraph 10 (e) and Appendix 5 to Schedule I) draw attention to the question of a possible base in Cyprus to supplement our base facilities in the Mediterranean. A very tentative estimate of the cost of the establishment of a complete base has been made, amounting to approximately  22-1 million. The proposal raises many big questions and the cost has not been included in the summary of estimates attached to this Report.63. As already mentioned in paragraph 29, we are of opinion that the Mediterranean situation is one which needs watching, and one factor in this is the question of such a base in Cyprus. It might be that some partial work, such as the building of a breakwater and the provision of a dock with certain repair facilities only, would be the correct solution of the problem.General.64. In the foregoing summary of the Admiralty estimates for making good deficiencies and providing for new construction, it is important to emphasise that nothing has been included for the inevitable expansion at the Admiralty and out-ports in the matter of staff to cope with the large volume of extra work that will be involved.Y. Army Programme and Requirements.(For details see Schedule II.)The Field Force.65. The role which we propose for the Army in paragraph 34 requires the following provision, viz., a Regular Field Force Contingent of 4 Divisions, a Mobile Division (see next paragraph), 2 Air Defence Brigades and Army Co-operation Squadrons of the Royal Air Force, together with the necessary complement of G-.FI.Q. Corps and L. of C. troops, the whole provided with all its essential needs as regards modern armament and material. This Force would form the first contingent of the Field Force, and would number about 155,000 men.66. Under these proposals the present Cavalry Division will be reorganised as a mobile division, consisting of 6 mechanised Cavalry Regiments and a Tank Brigade, together with appropriate supporting arms and services. Provision is also made for 3 new Army Tank Battalions, which, with the one now existing, will provide one per Infantry Division of the 1st (Regular) Contingent of the Field Force. These are considered essential for the. support of Infantry under modern conditions of warfare. In addition, the four Infantry Divisions would be mechanised in regard to their transport, in accordance with programmes already initiated.67. We regard rapidity of mobilisation as essential, and we therefore propose that arrangements should be speeded up so as to enable the Cavalry (Mobile) Division and Air Defence Brigades to be disembarked on the Continent in a week, and the remainder of the 1st Contingent a week later. This involves an ultimate increase of the annual recurrent expenditure from  1,100,000 to  1,500,000 as regards personnel (vide Schedule II, paragraph 6), and, in addition, further expenditure, may prove necessary in acquiring more rapidly other essential requirements for the force. It is becoming more and more obvious that if our assistance to Continental allies is to be effective, it must be available within a fortnight of the outbreak of war.
The Territorial A rmy.68. The Army Councils proposals further aim at supporting the first Regular Contingent by Contingents of the Territorial Army, fully equipped on a modern scale as follows :  .A second Contingent of 4 Divisions at 4 months after the outbreak of war.A third Contingent of 4 Divisions at 6 months after the outbreak of war.A fourth Contingent of 4 Divisions at 8 months after the outbreak of war.The fifth Regular Division which exists in peace would be used to stiffen the Territorial Division in the second Contingent, and is available at all times for despatch, in whole or in part, for lesser emergencies, without detriment to the first Contingent of the Field Force.69. In our earlier Report (D.R.C. 14, also CP. 64 (34)) we included a sum of no more than  250,000 per annum for the Territorial Army. At the present time as regards mobilisation, equipment and war reserves, the Territorial Army is little more than a paper force, and we propose, therefore, an outlay totalling  26,000,000 on the modernisation of the 12 Territorial Divisions which constitute the second, third and fourth Contingents in order to give them the necessary material to take part in modern war. The previous allotment of  250,000 per annum it is proposed to retain for the purpose of improving its training and efficiency by the provision of cadres, better training facilities, Regular instructors, &amp;c.A ammunition.70. The bulk of the ammunition for later Contingents could be found by post-war production, but reserves for the earlier Contingents, and especially the , first, must be held in peace to bridge over the period from the outbreak of war till factory production is adequate to meet war needs. The Army Council make proposals for the necessary reserves amounting to  35,276,000 (plus  1^ million for works services); this figure includes  743,000 passed in the current financial year. It is materially possible, within the first three years, to complete the above programme only to about 80 per cent, for the 1st (Regular) Contingent of the Field Force, but within five years we should be in sight of the complete require-ments for the whole four contingents of the Field Force. This is on the assumption that all the proposals for improving existing output are put into effect; failing that, the costs of the necessary reserves will be much greater and the time for completion greatly extended (vide Schedule IV, paragraphs 5 to 9).Coast Defence.71. So far as Coast Defence is concerned, the Army Council&apos;s proposals provide for the following items : (a) Singapore.Completion of Stage I of the Defences, the installation of a further two 15-inch guns (paid for by the gift of the Sultan of Johore), and also the completion of Stage II of the Defences by the addition of three further 6-inch-gun batteries, defence electric lights, and barracks for a third British Battalion.(b) Hong Kong, Aden, Ceylon and Penang.An increase from  200,000 a year to  300,000 a year in the provision for other ports East of Suez, in order that the programme may be completed in 10 instead of 15 years. The more important portion of the programme would, of course, be finished at a much earlier date. A large part of the additional expenditure is required for Hong Kong, but the lapse of the Washington Treaty or the deterioration of the political situation in the Far East would entail further increases, particularly in respect of Hong Kong.
(c) Malta, Gibraltar and Freetotvn.An increase to  150,000 per annum of the  100,000 per annum already allotted for the Mediterranean and Cape route, which would enable the more important items, especially Malta, to be completed within 14 years. The whole problem of the Mediterranean, as mentioned in paragraph 29 above, will, however, require reconsideration; for example, the question of proposed 15-inch guns at Malta and the possibility of a new Naval Base at Cyprus. If the suggestion to construct such a base at Cyprus, vide paragraph 62, is eventually approved, it will entail a considerable expenditure from Army funds over and above the figures already given. &quot;We can, therefore, regard the present proposals as only provisional.(d) Home Ports.An increase to  75,000 of the  25,000 per annum already allotted to Home Ports. The present allotment is quite insufficient to remedy even urgent requirements.Generally, therefore, an additional allotment of  300,000 per annum over and above those put forward in the first report of this Committee (D.R.C. 14, also CP. 64 (34)) is recommended as providing a reasonable programme for all coast defence, including  100,000 for extra personnel charges but excluding the capital cost of Stage II Defences for Singapore for which special provision is made.Air Defence of Great Britain.72. As regards the Air Defence of Great Britain, this cannot be completed in three years, but the Army Council&apos;s proposals should, in five years&apos; time, bring within sight the full suggested scale of anti-aircraft defence, provided that the necessary recruits can be obtained for the Territorial Army, which at the present time is in a bad way in this respect.73. The Army Council&apos;s proposal is that the whole of the authorised allot-ment of  590,000 (including ammunition) should be available for equipment for Air Defence of Great Britain other than ammunition. Anti-aircraft ammunition would be treated as a separate item and placed on a programme (Schedule II, paragraphs 26 to 28). The allotment now proposed for equipment other than ammunition will furnish the greatest acceleration practicable in the next two or three years.  At the end of that time the allotment should be further considered.New Infantry Battalions.74. Our proposals provide for an addition of 4 Infantry Battalions. We invite attention to paragraphs 29-31 of Schedule II, where it is shown that, in order to meet our foreign commitments in full, 6 additional Infantry Battalions are required abroad, with 6 more at Home to relieve them. Two are required for Malta, one for Singapore, two to replace two short-tour battalions abroad, and one to replace the second Guards Battalion in Egypt. If the battalion now at Tientsin cannot be withdrawn to Hong Kong, it will mean an additional battalion abroad and another at Home, making 14 in all. In the present state of recruiting, however, the raising of so many new Battalions is impracticable, and that is the sole reason for limiting the present proposal to 4 Battalions, of which one will probably be stationed at Singapore, one in Egypt and the remaining two at Home. These four battalions, therefore, represent only a first instalment of the 12 (or 14) required.Re-equipment of Field Artillery.(See Schedule II, Appendix VI.)75. New factors have recently arisen which have compelled us to consider the position regarding our Field Artillery equipments, the 18-pdr. gun and the 4-5-inch howitzer, both of which were put into the Service nearly 30 years ago. The Germans have abolished their war-time field gun and field howitzer and have adopted a single weapon with a range of over 12,000 yards. The ranges of our weapons  are  approximately  6,500  yards  for   the  4-5-inch  howitzer   and[12270] d 2
9,000 yards for the 18-pdr. In reconditioning our Field Army it is essential now to take into consideration the re-equipment of our Field Artillery. Preliminary trials with an 18-pdr. gun relined to take a 25-lb. shell and giving a range of 12,000 yards have been satisfactory. If further trials give good results, we recommend that both the 18-pdr. and 4-5-inch howitzer equipments of the Field Army should be replaced by this converted gun. If, on the other hand, we retain the existing guns and build up, as we should have to, large reserves of ammunition for them, we should, when the equipments were subsequently changed, find that a considerable part of the expenditure thus incurred would have been wasted.76. We are informed that, if the necessary steps are authorised at once, in five years&apos; time the majority, if not all, of the Field Artillery will have been re-equipped and adequate ammunition reserves will have been built up. But even though the conversion of the 18-pdr. gun is decided upon, it will still be necessary to purchase existing types of ammunition to hold as reserves for such time as existing guns remain in the Service, but the change over will be gradual, and India will continue to need such ammunition for a long time, as in her case similar rearmament can be expected to lag considerably behind ours. One result of the change over, until it is completed, will be that (as in 1914) we shall have different field artillery equipments in different contingents, but provided that, under a carefully drawn up programme, adequate reserves exist for all types, it would be an inconvenience rather than a danger.77. A decision to re-equip the Artillery on a large scale always presents difficulties, but we consider that, under proper arrangements, no risk should eventuate, and our position in five years&apos; time, with a modernised and more powerful weapon, will be greatly improved. In view of the superiority of this new German gun, it is wiser, and in the end less costly, to take that decision now rather than to postpone it.Improvement in Housing.78. The last item in the Army&apos;s list is a programme of works services spread over ten &quot;years, and costing  16,000,000 exclusive of additional staff. Of this  6,000,000 can be made available in Army Votes at their present level over that period, leaving a net total of  10,000,000 beyond normal provision.At present many units occupy hutted or barrack accommodation far below modern standards, and, indeed, in some cases approximating to slum conditions. This situation is due to financial stringency since the war. The barracks in question are so old as to be incapable of improvement and must be rebuilt completely. The huts have in most cases not only long passed their economic life and are disproportionately expensive to maintain, but will not stand up very much longer.The sum now asked for is intended to ensure that the bulk of the Army is accommodated in satisfactory conditions and up to the standard now enjoyed by the Royal Navy on shore and Royal Air Force; this is not only fair to the troops but will also improve the present state of Army recruiting.Recruiting.79. Improved recruiting both for the Regular and Territorial Army is an essential requisite for the fulfilment of the Army Council&apos;s proposals. At the present time the authorised peace establishments and actual strengths in many of the arms and services of the Regular Army are inadequate, and insufficient reserves are available to complete units to war establishment and to replace casualties in the interval before post-mobilization recruits can be trained.In the Territorial Army the situation is even more serious and a very large increase in peace strength, possibly coupled with the formation of a Territorial Army reserve, will be necessary if the Territorial Army contingents are to be ready to take the field at the times indicated in paragraph 68 and if the units required for air defence and home defence are to be capable of fulfilling their role.It is essential that recruiting be improved for both the regular and territorial forces. The provision of men is the first essential if the Army is to meet its obligations.
The Army Council are at the present moment considering certain steps to popularise service. These, however, will, it is feared, be by themselves inadequate unless the matter receives the full support of members of the Government and of public men and public bodies. It may be that when the people of this country realise that the situation is such as to require the rehabilitation of our defences recruits may present themselves in larger numbers. Better conditions and the introduction of modern equipment may also assist in attracting recruits.These improvements will involve additional expenditure, and, should they prove inadequate, there may be no alternative but to increase the pay of the forces so as to compete with conditions which exist in the labour market. Such an increase would involve a considerable addition to Army Estimates, and would also affect the Navy and Air Force.Appendix VII to Schedule II deals with the shortage of personnel and the problem of recruiting in more detail.YL-Air Force Programme and Requirements.(For details, see Schedule III.)80. As indicated in paragraph 34 above, the proposals of the Air Council comprise (i) The completion of the expansion programme as at present approved, so as to increase our metropolitan first-line air strength to a total of 123 squadrons (1,512 aircraft) by April 1937.It should be understood, however, that increases in the strength of Germany and France above 1,500 first-line aircraft would involve corresponding increases in our own first-line strength.lii) The provision of Army Co-operation squadrons to accompany the field forces on the following scale :-(a) First contingent (regular), 7 squadrons (each of 12 aircraft);(b) One squadron for communication purposes to accompany the firstcontingent;(c) Second contingent (territorial) (after 4 months), 4 or 5 squadrons;(d) Third contingent (territorial) (after 6 months), 4 or 5 squadrons;(e) Fourth contingent (territorial) (after 8 months), to be raised on mobilisation.Present arrangements allow for 5 Army Co-operation Squadrons of the Royal Air Force to accompany the first contingent of the Field Force, each squadron having 18 aircraft. The War Office have represented that from the point of view of Army organisation, it would be preferable if there were 7 squadrons each of 12 aircraft. This arrangement would provide a squadron for co-operation with each of the two Corps headquarters and five Divisions constituting the first contingent of the Field Force (vide para-graph 65). In a war of movement it is desirable that Divisional Commanders should be able to control the air reconnaissance on their own immediate fronts. If a total of only 5 squadrons is available, such an arrangement would clearly not be possible. A further argument in favour of the new proposal is that a squadron of 12 aircraft is a more mobile and compact unit for a war of movement than one of 18, owing to the reduction in quantity of transport, stores, &amp;c. On the other hand, the 7-squadron organisation will be rather more expensive in personnel and accommodation.A squadron is required to accompany the first contingent for inter-communication by air, especially to assist Commanders and Staff Officers to maintain touch between formations and units when roads are congested and other communications are bad. Details of equipment and strength will require discussion between the Air Ministry and War Office, and for this item no financial provision is at present included.The 8 squadrons required as the complement of the 8 territorial divisions of the second and third contingents would be auxiliary air force squadrons. As, however, there are practical limits to the number of auxiliary squadrons which can be effectively raised, the Air Council propose to meet these
requirements in part by an increase of 4 additional auxiliary squadrons (over and above the 16 at present included in the scheme for home defence), and in part by converting from bombers to Army Co-operation four of the auxiliary squadrons at present earmarked as part of the Air Force expansion scheme. To replace these units four new regular bomber squadrons would be raised. The adoption of this plan would enable squadrons to be raised in localities where they could co-operate with the territorial divisions to which they are allotted.It may later be necessary to raise two more squadrons, in order to bring the complement for Territorial Divisions up to 10.In addition to the above, additional spotter flights will eventually be required for co-operation with Coast defences at Home, probably three flights in all.  No financial provision for this is at present included.(iii) The provision of a first-line strength of 504 aircraft for the Fleet air arm, in accordance with the Admiralty&apos;s programme, and the consequent provision of further shore accommodation at home and abroad.(iv) The provision of additional aircraft at various overseas stations,amounting to 13 squadrons and 2 or more Spotter Flights, par-ticulars of which are as under :- &apos;/ (a) Singapore.An extra land-plane reconnaissance squadron, making the total number of squadrons permanently based at Singapore up to 6. Provision is also needed for two additional operational landing grounds to facilitate the operation of squadrons permanently allocated to Singapore and of those earmarked to proceed there as reinforcements.(b) Penang, Ceylon and Aden.One land-plane reconnaissance squadron at each of the above.These squadrons are required to co-operate with the Navy in the protection of the sea communications to the Far East, to assist in the defence of British territory and commerce in the Southern Pacific and Indian Oceans until the arrival of the Fleet at Singapore, and to secure bases which will be required by the Fleet on its passage from European waters. As the plan for the defence of Singapore involves immediate air reinforcement in an emergency by 4 squadrons from India and Iraq, no further squadrons are likely to be available in those Commands for rapid despatch to the ports in question. Moreover, the type of squadron best suited for the purpose is one trained and equipped for long flights over the sea, and no such squadrons are available outside the United Kingdom for strategic reinforcement purposes. Provision of appropriate squadrons permanently based at Penang, Ceylon and Aden is therefore essential. As and when it becomes necessary, spotter flights for co-operation with the Coast Defences and the requirements of the Army for the training of anti-aircraft units will have to be provided.(c) Hong Kong.Approval has already been given in principle to the establishment at Hong Kong of a force of 4 squadrons and 1 spotter flight, together with a repair unit and an additional aerodrome.(d) Middle East.To give effect to the principle of a strategic air reserve enabling rein-forcement along the imperial air routes, it is recommended that an additional squadron should be located in the Middle East Command for this purpose. Provision, therefore, is included for 1 General Purpose squadron in order to strengthen our defensive position overseas.(e) Malta.It is recommended that the force at Malta should ultimately comprise 2 squadrons and 1 spotter flight. This provision is subject to further consideration to which reference is made in paragraph 29.
(f) West Africa.The air requirements for West Africa were stated by the Joint Over-sea and Home Defence Committee in the following terms : &quot;It is considered that the scale of attack on Freetown could be effectively reduced by the provision in Sierra Leone in peace time of a total of 2 bomber squadrons and 1 fighter bomber squadron.&quot;It is considered that until the international situation is more clarified the provision of these units is not of urgent moment, but the matter should be kept under constant review. In the meanwhile, provision is made for the establishment of an aerodrome and for 1 General Purpose squadron.(g) East A frica.For more than a year a proposal has been under consideration for the establishment of a squadron in East Africa for local defence purposes. The - principal difficulty has been that the British Territories in East Africa cannot afford to pay the capital cost of the squadron, and cannot maintain it except by reducing three battalions of the local forces; and the General Staff hold strongly that, this reduction could not be made without detriment to security an opinion which has been confirmed by recent events. Without prejudice to the question of whether or when the East African Territories will be in a position to maintain the squadron in whole or in part, we recommend that one General Purpose squadron should be provided as a further contribution to the strategic air reserve. It would, of course, also be invaluable for local defence.(h) West Indies.1 reconnaissance (flying-boat or land-plane) squadron should be established.(i) Gibraltar.Provision has been taken for the establishment of a landing ground with flying-boat facilities.Up to the present the &apos;&apos; all British &apos;&apos; route from the United Kingdom to the Middle East has been impracticable for aircraft owing to the limitations of flying range and to the lack of suitably spaced landing grounds in British territory. The first of the difficulties has now practically disappeared, and within a few years a large proportion of Royal Air Force squadrons in the United Kingdom will be equipped with aircraft capable of flying direct to Gibraltar (the longest stage in the route), and thence to Malta and the Middle East. The provision of an adequate intermediate air base at Gibraltar is therefore the key to the whole strategic conception of Imperial air defence, and on it will depend our ability to carry out large-scale reinforcement flights from England to other parts of the Empire, and vice versa, for many years to come. An air base at Gibraltar is also essential for the local operation of land planes and seaplanes engaged in trade protection and air defence. There are many difficulties, political, geographical, meteorological and social, in the way of providing the required facilities, but preliminary investiga-tion of the problem suggests that they are not insuperable. Accurate estimates of the total costs involved cannot be given until further enquiries have been made and plans have been drawn up.Sea Reconnaissance.81. The Air CounciLs proposals under paragraph 80 (iv) above are designed to enable the fullest use to be made of mobility and to permit reinforcement of the threatened locality as required. The Air Staff, in conjunction with the Naval Staff, are giving full consideration to the needs of the Navy in reconnaissance aircraft to assist in the protection of trade routes and naval bases. Pending these explorations, we are not in a position to include a definite figure for this purpose.  It is, however, a commitment which must be borne in mind.Provision dependent upon International Situation.82. Certain of the requirements shown above must be regarded as provisional, since they are dependent on the outcome of the existing international situation.   For Malta, the Middle East and East Africa, for instance, require-
meets are framed without regard to the deterioration in the political relations between this country and Italy, or to the strength of the forces which Italy may ultimately keep in her African colonies. These are matters which, like the strategical situation in the Mediterranean, will require careful examination when the present Italo-Abyssinian question is cleared up. In the interim, as will be seen above, we have recommended an immediate provision of one composite squadron and one flight for Malta, one general purpose squadron for the Middle East, and one general purpose squadron for East Africa,Similarly, the general purpose squadron proposed for West Africa must be regarded as provisional for reasons given in paragraph 80 (iv) (/).War Reserves.(i) Material.83. The main item of expenditure in the Air Council&apos;s recommendations relates to the provision of war reserves. It is clear that in air warfare, particularly in Europe, the clash will be immediate, intensive and sustained. Losses in personnel and material will be heavy. The expenditure of armament stores and fuel supplies will be continuous and on a large scale. Unless this wastage is continually replaced our air forces will be rapidly reduced in strength, and in a very short time will become, impotent either to defend this country against air attack, or to undertake offensive operations against the enemy. War reserves to be adequate must be such as will bridge the gap between the outbreak of war and the time at which the aircraft industry can meet the demand. As yet it has only been possible to carry out a preliminary investigation of the potentialities of the aircralt industry in war. Based upon this investigation and upon the anticipated rate of wastage, it is calculated that it will be necessary to maintain in time of peace a reserve of aircraft amounting to 200 per cent, of the first-line strength. Of this 200 per cent., however, it is expected that 50 per cent, could be obtained from the working reserves provided for peace-time maintenance, and in consequence the net figure for Avar reserves of aircraft will be 150 per cent., with a rather lower scale for the Fleet Air Arm.84. The anticipated rate of wastage in pilots in war is also very high, and in consequence it is- necessary to hold in reserve in time of peace sufficient aircraft and engines to permit the establishment of additional flying training schools immediately on the outbreak of war to maintain the supply of pilots. It is considered that four months&apos; supply in both airframes and engines is necessary for this specific purpose.85. Other items of aircraft equipment, airframe and engine spares and general supplies have been calculated on the same basis, i.e., to cover the interval before the output from the industry on a war basis could meet the demand, which is at present assumed to be six months. In the case of bombs, small arms ammunition and pyrotechnics, it is calculated that six months&apos; supply would be necessary to be held in reserve.86. For motor transport, provision is made only for initial requirements and for reserves of technical vehicles which cannot be readily obtained from civil sources. It is hoped to procure the remaining requirements by requisitioning on the outbreak of war.87. A further item of expenditure in the Air Council&apos;s proposals to which the Committee wish to draw attention is the provision of storage for reserves, and the provision of jigs and tools for the manufacture of aircraft. It is hoped that it may be possible to combine the provision of reserve storage with the provision of adequate erecting space for the aircraft industry to meet the big demands which will be made upon it on mobilisation. It may, therefore, be possible for a part of the expenditure required for the provision of storage for reserve aircraft to be borne by the aircraft industry. The provision of jigs and tools, &amp;o, for the manufacture of aircraft is a heavy item.One aspect of the provision of aircraft reserves to which we wish to draw attention is the rapid rate at which aircraft become obsolescent through the intro-duction. of improved designs.   Under peace-time conditions the aircraft which
YII. Industrial Production.89.   As stated in paragraph 5 (ii), we have been instructed to include in our Report answers to the following questions : (a) What special measures would be required for increasing factory outputso as to provide the material required within the period named (i.e., by March 1939), and what would be the cost of those measures ?(b) If no such special measures were taken as regards factory output, what ,state of preparedness would we be able to achieve by that date, or, alternatively, how long a period would be required to reach the same state of preparedness as in (a) above?In addressing ourselves to these questions we have been largely guided by the Memorandum of the Master-General of the Ordnance, which is attached as Schedule IV, and, so far as Air Expansion is concerned, by the Memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff (Schedule III, paragraphs 4-7, and Appendix &quot; A &quot;)..90.   As regards question (a), we deal below with the methods of increasing factory output under the following heads : (a) Manufacture in or by Industry; and(b) Manufacture by Government Factories;and at the outset we would point out that our proposals do not take into consideration the requirements of the Dominions and India except to a small extent in the case of the A ir Ministry.Shadow Armament Industry.91. We consider that the only method by which very large deficiencies in war material can be supplied, and at the same time a &quot; potential &quot; for the much-greater quantities required after the outbreak of war built up, is by the creation of a &quot; Shadow Armament Industry.&quot;This is the method advocated by the Advisory Panel of Industrialists (Lord Weir, Lord Riverdale and Sir James Lithgow), and approved by the Committee&apos; of Imperial Defence.* In principle, this method is simple and its application is governed mainly by a regular supply of orders assured in advance.Briefly, the principle is that firms who do not normally make warlike stores are engaged to do so by placing orders with them in peace time on a relatively small scale, on the condition that they lay out their works and hold machinery for a war output greatly in excess of their peace production.Whilst the &quot;Shadow Armament industry&quot; scheme applies essentially to new firms, it can also be applied to existing contractors to extend their &apos;&apos; war potential.&quot;   We strongly recommend the adoption of this policy.* C.I.D. Paper No. 1138-B.   C.I.D., 264th Minutes, Conclusion 6.[12270]must be held in reserve to meet war wastage will, of course, be only partially used up. In consequence, heavy recurring expenditure will be required for periodical replacements of obsolete aircraft in the Reseiwe by newer types.(ii) Personnel.88. The problem of war reserves is not only one of equipment. A substantial enlargement of the reserve of pilots will also be required. As during the next four years the number of first-line units is being largely increased it will not be possible to accelerate the flow of Short Service Officers to the Reserve, and the only practicable solution of the problem is a larger entry than at present of persons who could be trained in flying ab initio for Reserve Service only. The Air Ministry estimate that a further entry to the Royal Air Force Reserve of 600 pilots a year for the next three years will be required additional to the rate of entry of 200 a year to which they are now working.
Conditions Necessary. 92.   The following are the conditions essential to this plan : (a) An approved long-term programme of rearmament (this will need to be reconciled in form with the constitutional prerogative of Parliament).(b) Continuity of orders to the Trade, so that contractors may be attracted by business propositions. Year to year contracts, except in the case of our normal contractors, have not proved to be an attraction. Contractors must be assured of continuous business over a term  of years, to justify them in training and retaining the necessary skilled personnel and supervisory staffs.(c) Government assistance (if found necessary) in order to provide the selected firms with the additional machinery, jigs, gauges and machine tools necessary to enable them to adapt their factories to the production of war material. We consider it important also that this subject should be discussed at an early date with representatives of labour and industry.   (See paragraph 93 (b) and (c) below.)(d) Greater   recourse  will   be  necessary  to   non-competitive  contracts.Generally also greater elasticity may be necessary in contract procedure.93. If the policy of creating a shadow armament industry is adopted, the following problems will arise : (a) The Provision of A additional Machinery, &amp;c.The Defence Departments are responsible for taking executive action to ensure the necessary extensions, rearrangement and provision of the additional machinery, jigs, gauges and machine tools of the firms allotted to them. The requirements of the selected firms would be assessed by the Departments concerned or by the Supply Board Technical Establishment^ as necessary in con-sultation with the firms, but the actual orders for machinery, &amp;c, would usually be placed by the firms themselves. A good deal of exploratory work in this connection has already been done by the Supply Board Technical Establishment working in pursuance of the policy concerted at the Principal Supply Officers Committee.* Machine tools are the bedrock of all production. Delays will, however, occur in their provision, as the machine tools industry in this country is at present swamped with work, having orders both from home and abroad for several months ahead. Moreover, there is a shortage of skilled labour. Unless arrangements are made to warn this industry of the probable increased require-ments, if possible with some indication in detail of the extent and nature of orders contemplated, so. that the necessary expansion of their works can be carried out in time, an inevitable delay of from six to nine months may occur before the industry can start to deliver the additional quantities of tools required.(b) Co-operation of Industry : and Method of Collaboration.We are convinced that it will only be possible to create the &quot; shadow armament industry&quot; in consultation with industry itself. Selected representa-tives of the industry and the organisations concerned in the expansion of industry for war production (including the machine tool manufacturers) must be taken into confidence and the defence requirements problem explained to them by a Minister or Ministers, preferably the Prime Minister. It will be necessary to enlist not only the goodwill of the manufacturers, but also their ideas and productive experience. The mobilisation of industry for the purpose will need a great deal of organisation within industry itself, and can only be gradually developed.   The help of the Advisory Panel of Industrialists (Lord Weir,* The Principal Supply Officers Committee under the Chairmanship of the President of tire Board of Trade is responsible for advising the Committee of Imperial Defence on Supply policy.The Supply Board under the direction of the Principal Supply Officers Committee is responsible, in conjunction with the Board of Trade, for preparing and maintaining estimates of war requirements of the nation, of raw materials. and manufactured products,, arid for ascertaining the productive capacity of the country required to meet our war requirements, j,.The Supply Board Technical Establishment is a special establishment administered by the War Office, and charged with the duty of studying in peace war manufacturing problems in eonnection with armament stores on behalf of the three Defence Departments.
Lord Riverdale and Sir James Lithgow) in this connection would be invaluable, and the Federation of British Industries has already expressed a willingness to play its part. On the Government side the programme must be planned in its sequence and detail in the first place by the Defence Departments in close association with the Treasury; and then co-ordinated by the Principal Supply Officers Organisation, in particular by the Supply Board, which will also deal with priorities as between the Defence Services, subject, we suggest, to appeal to our Committee in the event of a deadlock.(c) Provision of Labour.It will be appreciated that increased orders for war material will necessitate a large increase in the amount of skilled and unskilled labour required in the engineering industry and generally, of which there is at present a considerable shortage, not only for civilian firms, but even for the Royal Ordnance Factories and the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. Steps will therefore have to be planned, both by Government Departments and the firms concerned, to train the type of personnel required, and consultation with the Trade Unions will be necessary.(d) Prevention of Profiteering.This is a danger which must be anticipated and will need the firmest handling. It is not only a question of safeguarding the taxpayer against unjustifiable charges; if that were all, the existing contracts branches of the three Defence Departments are, we believe, quite capable of dealing with extortionate tendencies on the part of any company or firm to which they may be giving orders. It is essential, in addition, that the public in general, and labour in particular, should have no excuse for any feeling or fear (however unjustified in reality) that contractors are taking advantage of the country&apos;s needs to feather their own nests. Ensuring public confidence on this point is a vital condition if the defensive equipment of the country on the necessary scale is to be success-fully achieved. From this point of view and in no spirit of criticism towards the regular contracts branches we recommend to the consideration of the Board of Admiralty and the Army Council the special arrangement adopted by the Air Council in connection with the air force expansion scheme, viz. : the asso-ciation ad hoc of a small committee of well-known business men with the regular contracts branch. This arrangement is working quite smoothly and has proved the utility of providing a &apos;&apos; lightning conductor &apos;&apos; for suspicions of profiteering. If a similar scheme were applied to the Admiralty and War Office, the necessary inter-relationship would be insured through the agency of the existing Contracts Co-ordinating Committee.But there is another sphere of potential profiteering quite distinct from the contractors and sub-contractors to Government Departments, and that includes the whole range of raw and semi-wrought materials (such as steel, aluminium, &amp;c.) needed by the contractors and sub-contractors. Precautions against profiteering in this field are, of course, of the first importance; and we recommend that the Treasury, in conjunction with the Board of Trade and the other Departments concerned, should take up this question at an early date with a view to ensuring the necessary safeguards.(e) Allocation of Firms to Defence Departments.In order to obviate overlapping, the Supply Board and its appropriate Sub-Committee should (as part of the functions referred to in (&amp;) above) complete, at an early date, the allocation of firms between Defence Departments, on the-principle that firms, whose production is required by a Defence Department in war, should have the necessary proportion of their capacity available to that Department for production in peace.Manufacture in Government Factories. 94. So far we have dealt with the considerations which apply mainly to. manufacture in or by the trade. There remains the case of the Government factories. To complete our war requirements there is a specialised kind of output, which is either non-existent in the trade or covers so small a proportion of our eventual requirements that we must rely largely (at all events at the earlier [12270] &apos; E 2
stages) on Government factories. This mainly consists of such categories as explosives and propellants, the filling of shells and cartridges, and fuzes, bombs, mines and torpedoes; and we see no option but to extend our Government factories and to put down the necessary capital.Cost of Measures Recommended.95. It will be recognised that this Section deals with the whole crux of the problem, and our productive capacity must be enormously enlarged.It would be premature to estimate the costs of the measures for increasing factory capacity, both in the trade and in Government Factories referred to in the preceding paragraphs, but at our request tentative figures have been supplied by:-The War Office :  16,000,000 (Appendix II to Schedule II); and by The Air Ministry :  10,100,000 (Appendix A to Schedule III).The Air Ministry total includes the sum of  2,100,000 required so that immediate measures can be taken to expand the capacity for the manufacture of bombs in this country, which at present is very small.The total expenditure under this head is therefore put conjecturally at about  26,100,000, but it should be realised that expenditure on industrial production and provision of reserves (which will itself involve provision of special machinery) are closely inter-related. The figure of  16,000,000 given by the War Office is, however, entirely dependent on the success which attends our policy of expanding industry to meet our requirements. If this policy fails it will be necessary to open up more Government Factories, and the figure of  16,000,000 will accordingly be increased. It is therefore true to say that the figures quoted above can, at present, hardly be regarded even as approximate.State of Preparedness achieved by 1939 without Special Measures to increaseFactory Output.96. This question, which is referred to in paragraph 89 (&amp;), is one which does not affect the Navy, as for practical purposes no special measures are considered necessary, and any expenditure for this purpose would be relatively small.97. As regards the Army, we should by the end of the financial year 1938-39 still be dependent on our existing resources plus such contractors as might be persuaded to enlarge their equipment. Our &quot; war potential &quot; would stand practically as it stands to-day (e.g., in the case of ammunition requirements a deficiency to the extent of some 85 per cent, in the first year of war), all of which would have to be created after mobilisation.The first contingent of the Field Force would still be short by 50 per cent, of its present deficiencies and have no &quot; war potential &quot; behind it. It might be maintained perhaps four months in the field a repetition of 1914.With reference to the alternative question of how long a period would be required in the absence of special measures to increase output to reach the state of preparedness referred to in paragraph 89 (a), here again we must assume that the &quot;war potential&quot; would be practically non-existent for many items required. The corollary is that we should have to create and hold in peace time reserves sufficient to see us through the period required for the development of &quot;war potential,&quot; which must be estimated at about a year. (Itwill be remembered that in 1918, after the Ministry of Munitions had been in existence well over two years, to build and get into production a new factoiy took a full twelve months.)We estimate that the stocks to be held in reserve as provided for in this Report would have to be nearly doubled (measured by money values, which gives a figure of  150-200 million which we might spend in 15-20 years); but it must be remembered that the very long period of peace, say, upward of twenty years, required for the accumulation of such stocks cannot be guaranteed.98. In the case of the Royal Air Force, on the assumption that the aircraft and engines required to complete the present expansion programme have actually been produced by the 31st March, 1937, we anticipate that the enlargement of the industry for that purpose will suffice also to secure the production by the end
ti 13of 1938-39. of the numbers of aircraft and engines, &amp;c, required for the scale of reserves which we propose to accumulate in peace-time.As regards the position on the outbreak of war, if no special measures had been taken to provide in addition a &quot; war potential,&quot; the position would be as follows :  During the first year of war an output of aircraft and engines will be required of approximately eight times the maximum annual output reached by the Industry in the course of supplying our requirements to complete our reserves on the scale now proposed. It is unlikely that more than one-third of the total war require-ments could be obtained from firms normally engaged on aircraft and engine production, allowing for increased shifts and other means for accelerating output. The balance could only be obtained by turning over suitable outside firms to aircraft and engine production; but in the absence of the special measures recommended in this section of our report there would be a long delay before these new firms could come into production, and that interval would spell disaster to us.Recapitulation.99. The subject dealt with in the preceding paragraphs is so vital to -our security that we make no apology for briefly recapitulating the points.If we are involved in war and are to have any chance of successfully defending ourselves we must ensure the availability of the necessary material equipment of all kinds by adopting one or other of the three following methods :  (i) Create and hold in peace-time reserves on such a scale as would suffice to cover the period, however long, needed for the conversion without previous preparation of our peace industries into war industries;(ii) Organise, for war, our industries in peace-time so completely as toenable the greater part of the war reserves to be dispensed with;(iii) Combine these two methods but on a much lower level, i.e., build upin peace-time reserves sufficient for a limited period after the outbreak of war, and simultaneously plan and arrange our industrial capacity in peace-time so that in the interval assured by these reserves it is able to turn over to full war productionMethod No. (i) would take years to complete and would be very uneconomical owing to equipment becoming obsolescent. Method No. (ii) is unthinkable in a democratic country like ours. Accordingly it is the last method, No. (iii), which we recommend as the only practicable alternative to doing nothing at all.100. In conclusion we must enter a caveat that, in the most favourable conditions it will be impossible to carry out the full programme of supply for the emergency of war by the 31st March, 1939.   (See Schedule IV, paragraph 5.)VIII. Miscellaneous Requirements.101. In preceding Sections of this Report we have dealt with the major requirements of our three Defence Services. There are, however, a number of matters closely connected with our Terms of Reference, to which we must draw attention if our Report is to present a complete picture of our defence requirements.Air Raid Precautions.102. A survey of our defence position would not be complete without reference to Air Raid * Precautions. We therefore asked the Air Raid Precautions Department of the Home Office to supply us with a statement of their estimated needs over the next few years.103. Their Memorandum on the subject is appended as Schedule V, from which it appears that the provision of Respirators (which has already been accepted by the Cabinet) will amount to a possible total of  4 million plus some  400,000 for corresponding protection for children.   Other items, not
yet so clearly defined, are Protective Clothing, Bleach Powder and Hospital&apos; equipment, amounting to some  610,000. In addition to the large expenditure which may eventually fall on the Home Office, considerable sums, which cannot at present be estimated, may have to be spent by the Service Departments.104. In their General Remarks on the question the Air Raid Precautions Department again call attention to the dangers to which our vital industries are liable in the event of air attack, a subject which is of ever-increasing importance and anxiety. Information on this subject is being collected, and as material is available the Department will put forward special appreciations for the consideration of the Committee of Imperial Defence.Woolwich, Billingham and Ardeer.105. The dangers to which Woolwich Arsenal may be exposed have already been recognised, but we feel we should bring to particular notice the very important establishments of Imperial Chemical Industries Limited at Billingham and Ardeer. At these factories exist the only plant in the country for the&apos; exidation of ammonia and nitric acid, both essential components of explosives and propellants. Centralisation of so important a factor of our munitions production in two places, and especially that at Billingham, which to-day is within reasonable air range of Germany, constitutes a veritable &quot; Achilles&apos;&apos; heel.&quot; The size of the plants is so great, and so much money has been expended,, that there can be no question of moving them, but it is for consideration whether every encouragement should not be given to the duplication, in a safe part of the country, of such component parts as are absolutely vital.Secret Service.106. The attention of the Committee has been drawn to the difficulties imposed on our Secret Service by lack of funds, and it is indispensable that increased provision should be made for this most important purpose. Informa-tion is, for obvious reasons, far more difficult to obtain now than formerly in all the countries that really matter, particularly Germany and Japan. If the allowance under this head is not augmented, and very largely augmented, the organisation cannot be expected to fulfil its functions, and this country will be most dangerously handicapped. It is difficult to assign an exact figure to this service, on which increased demands are continually made; but nothing less than  500,000 will be really adequate.Armed Merchant Cruisers and Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships.107. The Admiralty make provision for supplementing the cruiser fleet by the conversion of certain merchant ships into Armed Merchant Cruisers after outbreak of hostilities. By the Washington Naval Treaty the preparations which can be made in ships in time of peace are limited to the necessary stiffening of decks for the mounting of guns not exceeding 6-inch calibre. Should this limitation not be repeated in any future treaty, it would be possible for more complete measures of preparation to be made. No such financial provision is made in the Admiralty proposals, however, in view of the uncertainty of the situation.The Admiralty have in their proposals made provision only for the low-angle guns, ammunition, paravanes and general stores required for both Armed Merchant Cruisers and Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships. The general policy of equipping these vessels with improved arrangements for anti-aircraft defence is under consideration. When this is settled, provision for high-angle guns and equipment, &amp;o, will require annual consideration in the normal estimates.Encouragement of Commercial Air Enterprises.108. In this Report we do not put forward any proposals for increased financial assistance to commercial air enterprises, as we are aware that the direct value to Imperial Defence of subsidies to Commercial Air Enterprises is much less than that of an equivalent expenditure on the Royal Air Force. Nevertheless we recognise that, for reasons not directly connected with Imperial Defence, such as national prestige, the improvement of communications and postal services, it is the policy of the Government to develop civil aviation. We wish to record our view, subject to the above remarks, that such development is of distinct value to
IX. Cost and Finance.112. Our Terms of Reference, as stated in paragraph 5 of this Report, leave entirely open the method by which the programmes of the Defence Services are to be financed. But we have worked on the assumption in those Terms of Reference that-&quot; By the end of the financial year 1938-39, each Service should have advanced its state of readiness to the widest necessary extent in relation to the military needs of national defence within the limits of practicability.&quot;On this basis, as stated in paragraph 35, our proposals for the three Defence Services would result in an increased annual expenditure over the  124 million (original Estimates) voted for Defence in 1935, of the order of  49,650,000 in 1936,  86,750,000 in 1937,  102,400,000 in 1938,  88,450,000 in 1939, and  90,050,000 in 1940. In other words, an increased expenditure, compared to the 1935 rate, of about  239,000,000 in the next three years, and a further  178,500,000 in the following two 3rears. In addition, there is a proposed increase in the Home Office vote of  1,847,000 a year for each of the next three years, for Air Raid Precautions equipment; and a recommendation that increased provision should be made for Secret Service work up to  500,000 per annum.Imperial Defence. The establishment of bases, trained personnel, factory-production, experience in design and the aircraft themselves including, in particular, flying-boat services which could be used to augment the reconnaissance facilities of the Navy and other Services in the event of hostilities are all valuable elements in our war potential.Forces in the Colonies.109. In view of the present world situation, it is most important that the regular and auxiliary forces in the Colonies, Mandated Territories, &amp;o, should be maintained in the highest state of efficiency. The cuts carried out in view of financial stress during recent years have reduced these forces to a minimum and early consideration should be given to restoring them to their former strength. The importance of full support being given to the auxiliary forces should be -especially emphasised.. The Dominions.110. The attention of the Dominions should be directed to the measures which His Majesty&apos;s Government in this country have in contemplation and to the reasons which in their view render these necessary. Their co-operation in reducing the burden, or alternatively in increasing the scale of security provided, should be sought in suitable terms. The Air Ministry have included in their requirements the necessary material for equipping 16 squadrons from the Dominions, as it is thought that in a major war the most useful form their help could take would be to send the personnel sufficient for a certain number of squadrons to this country, the necessary equipment being provided here. The War Office, however, are not able to estimate what ma)^ be required for land forces from the Dominions and India in similar circumstances and no allowance has consequently been made on their behalf.The Remedying of Deficiencies in India.111. In our first Report we made a recommendation that the Government of India should be urged to expedite their &quot; worst deficiencies &quot; in order to keep parallel with our own action in the matter. We fully appreciate that financial considerations must hamper such action, but if the Home Government is now to take yet further steps, and at great cost, to put our defences in order, we consider that it is only fair to expect India also to loosen the purse-strings. There is wide scope in India for improving the readiness for war of the Army, the Royal Air Force and of her Local Naval Defences.
113. We ivould again emphasise that this forecast is necessarily speculative, and is merely an attempt to indicate the order of magnitude of the expenditure involved.   No allowance has been made therein for variations of rates and prices.114. The detailed expenditure on each Service allocated to the various items are contained in Schedules I, II and III annexed to this Report. For convenience, the financial aspects of the Service proposals are summarised in Table I (Navy), Table II (Army) and Table III (Air Force). A general statement showing the totals of each Service is attached as Table IV. These Tables have been worked out, so far as possible, on a common pro forma, and in each case sub-table A shows capital expenditure, sub-table B net increase over 1935 provision in annual recurrent charges arising from present proposals, the capital cost of which is set out in sub-table A; and sub-table C gives a rough forecast of net estimates for the next five years if the proposals are approved. In studying these tables it is of great importance that the accompanying footnotes should receive close attention.In the case of the Navy, an additional sub-table is appended (Table Ia*) showing the costs of naval construction. -It will be appreciated that financial provision for naval construction cannot conveniently or appropriately be shown either as a capital cost or as an annual recurrent charge due to capital costs.. For that reason it is convenient to show costs under this head in a separate forim We would call attention to the fact referred to in paragraph 47, that the rate of naval construction after the financial year 1939 will be governed by the continuation or otherwise of Naval Treaties, under which, at present, our naval forces are limited.115. Additional to Service expenditure, but a form of expenditure which should be classed as &quot; Defence,&quot; are the costs for Air Raid Precautions. The sum totals, as given in Schedule V and summarised in paragraph 103, are as follows: Provision of Respirators and similar devices for children,  4,400,000;: Protective Clothing, Bleach Powder and Hospital Equipment,  610,000. With a three year spread-over, these would involve an annual charge on Home Office Votes of  1,847,000.116. In paragraph 106 we have further recommended that increased provision should be made for Secret Service work up to  500,000 per annum.117. Throughout the Report we have referred to a number of matters which are still under discussion or on which it is not possible, for various reasons, to make any recommendations at the present time. The most important, from the financial point of view, of these outstanding items are as follows :-(a) Possible expenditure in further modernisation of old capital ships should Japan increase the numerical strength of her battle fleet by the retention of old capital ships in addition to any replacement she may construct (paragraph 56).(6) Further increases in reconnaissance aircraft to assist the Navy in the protection of trade routes and Naval Bases (paragraphs 80 (iv) and 81).(c) Possible expenditure in the provision of a Fleet Air Arm base ashore,in addition to the figure of  2 million already proposed (paragraph 61).(d) Possible expenditure in providing a Naval Base in Cyprus (para-graph 62).(e) Ultimate expenditure involved in the provision of additional infantry battalions not at present recommended owing to recruiting limitations (paragraph 74).(/) Additional expenditure on the defences of Hong Kong if the present restrictions under Article XIX of the Washington Treaty are removed (paragraph 71 (&amp;)).Expenditure in Foreign Countries.*118. In considering the financial aspect of our proposals we feel we should draw attention to what has been happening abroad. Most of the great Powers have for some time past relied on borrowing to meet some part of the cost of their* Figures quoted are at current rates of exchange.
X. Observations.The Difference between this Enquiry said that of 1934.123.   In reaching the conclusions which we now recommend, we think it relevant to recall that the circumstances of our present enquiry differ completely from those leading up to our first Report (D.R.C. 14, also CP. 64 (34) ).   Our earlier Report, by the instructions under which we were working, was concerned [12270] fFighting Services. The procedure adopted varies. In some countries specific items of defence expenditure are met from loans. In others the rate of expen-diture on armaments results in a deficit on the Budget as a whole which is met by borrowing.Japan.119. The army and navy account for  59-7 million, out of a total expen-diture of  123-4 million, while the deficit on the Budget is  45 million (1935-36).United States of A merica.120. Items described as emergency expenditure correspond broadly to the Budget deficit. The items of expenditure on the Navy and War Departments which fall under the head of emergency expenditure (i.e., expenditure creating employment) amounted to  42-3 million in 1934-35 and  22 million in 1935-36. The total annual expenditure, from revenue and loans combined, of the United States on defence has risen from  114 million in 1933 to  180 million in 1935. These figures include no provision for non-effective charges (e.g., pensions), which in the case of the British estimates for 1935 represented no less than  18 million out of the total of  124 million.France.121. Special borrowing powers have been obtained to meet specific items of defence expenditure, and there has also been a series of deficits on her Budget. Thus, in 1934, the law of the 7th July, 1934, authorised special borrowing powers of  41-8 million, while a further  10-7 million was authorised by the law of the 4th January, 1935. Expenditure under these laws will continue in the year 1936. An ostensible reduction of the defence expenditure included in the ordinary Budget from  134 million in 1935 to  89.5 million in 1936, to enable the Budget to be balanced, is accompanied by the creation of Fonds d&apos;Armements financed by borrowing, from which  73 million is to be spent in 1936.Germany.122. The real state of the Budget since the accession to power of Herr Ff itler has not been made public. According to public returns the debt increased by 7,000 million marks between December 1932 and June 1935. This sum is equiva-lent at the old rate of exchange to  350 million sterling, but at the official rates now prevailing to  570 million sterling. WTnle this increase was no doubt in part for Public Works, a substantial sum was certainly for armaments. But it is known that there are armament bills and Bank advances and liabilities in respect of Government guarantees which are not included in the published debt returns. According to confidential information the additional liabilities so incurred in the same period have been put as high as 12,000 million marks ( 600 to  980 million sterling) and are alleged to be increasing at the rate of 500 million marks a month ( 25 to  40 million sterling). In terms of sterling there is reason to believe that the expenditure on re-armament (outside the Budget) was between  500 million and  1,000 million in its peak year, and that such expenditure has been running round about  500 million a year, though it may now be beginning somewhat to diminish.
solely with our &quot;worst deficiencies&quot; which, if possible, were to be met on a five-year programme. Under our present terms of reference, however, we are required to work out &quot; programmes on the assumption that by the end of the financial year 1938-39 each Service should have advanced its state of readiness to the widest necessary extent in relation to the military needs of National defence and within the limits of practicability.&quot;124. It is not necessary to recapitulate the causes, chiefly in the inter-national situation, which have necessitated, within a period of less than two years, so great a change in the general outlook on defence matters. But the-fact serves to emphasise that the subject of Defence Requirements is not one which, after decisions have been reached, can be dismissed for any long period as a matter which has been finished and done with. New events will occur, which in the majority of cases are likely to increase, rather than to reduce, our commit-ments and risks. There can therefore be no finality in this or any later review of Defence Requirements.Tendencies of the Future.125. The ambition, caprice, or brutality of man is not the only element of doubt or difficulty. The march of science is a factor which will tend in the future, even more perhaps than in the past, to enlarge defensive needs; the submarine, the aeroplane and the tank are obvious illustrations. Not only have these to be included in our armaments (in addition to and not in substitution for other weapons), but their antidotes have also to be invented, purchased and manned. The complications introduced into modern war will tend to grow, and as an instance may be quoted the ever-increasing range of aircraft which in the near future will necessitate defence measures at many places hitherto considered immune from air attack, and on a scale which we should be wise not to under-estimate.126. We have done our best in this Report to meet as satisfactorily as possible our responsibilities in respect of the defence of the Empire against the principal dangers to which it is exposed; but there are formidable difficulties, particularly in assessing at their proper value the risks to which we are exposed. We wish to emphasise that in calculating our Defence Requirements we have deliberately avoided any exaggeration of these risks and difficulties, and have based ourselves on a conservative estimate of what is necessary for security. Ohr Report, however, would be incomplete if we did not mention its limitations. The first of these difficulties concerns Maritime Power, on which our vital overseas communications depend.Maritime Power.127. It is well to remember that Maritime Power, once it is achieved, has this great advantage it is not easy to challenge it. Great navies cannot be built in a night, they are only created by a strong and consistent naval policy over a prolonged period with much financial sacrifice. Once supreme, the efforts of rival nations can be watched and guarded against and the lead kept.It is an inevitable corollary that, if a great Maritime Nation neglects its Navy, it must go through years of danger and anxiety before it can regain its old position of security.128. In certain important respects we are well on our way to lose our sea security. Our serious deficiency in cruiser strength is well known. Our Battle Fleet will die of old age at the same time as those of the United States and Japan, and, except for such new construction as is completed before that time, the existing Battle Fleets of these three great Powers would be reduced almost to a common zero level. Other nations may shortly be in a favourable position to challenge us at sea; Germany is in process of building a brand-new Fleet and has started a lap ahead.On the other hand, we still have something to rely on in our Naval experience and the fact that we have turned our national engineering skill into naval channels, also in our shipbuilding capacity, our great dockyards and bases, and the naval instinct of the nation which enables the Fleet to be manned with superior seamen.
If, therefore, we take up the task wholeheartedly and accept whatever sacrifices are necessary, the position can, we are certain, be retrieved gradually. The world knows we can do it and seeing us make a determined start may realise the futility of challenging us.The Uncertainty of the Future.129. A second main difficulty is that the conditions of the world to-day are such that the future course of events affecting Imperial Defence is more than usually uncertain. Elsewhere in this Report, for example, we have referred to the difficulty, under the system of collective security, of appraising the quarter, extent and occasion of the dangers we may have to meet, using for purposes of illustration the Manchurian dispute of 1931-33 and the Italo-Abyssinian dispute of 1935. No-one can foretell when or where the next emergency will ,arise, nor the extent to which our action may be trammelled by what has happened at Geneva in 1935. It may be that the arguments employed so effectively to secure the application of sanctions to Italy may be used with inexorable logic to secure our co-operation in the application of sanctions in some dispute (e.g., in Central or Eastern Europe), from which the country might otherwise prefer to stand aloof. A powerful State like Germany or Japan, harbouring the same resentment as Italy to-day, might react to sanctions in a very different manner and with very different results to ourselves.130. So far as Germany is concerned, one of the difficulties in predicting the course of events is the meagreness of our information of the capacity of that country for offensive action. Our own proposals have been worked out on the basis of such knowledge as we possess, and on an expert appreciation of German capacity based on that information; but we have no certainty that our information is complete. A recent illustration of effective concealment on Germany&apos;s part is to be found in her naval rearmament, on which our Intelligence proved defective. We know something of Germany&apos;s industrial development and capacity, but it would be a dangerous illusion for us to infer that we have a reliable measure of what she can do; still less of what she may be able to do in the near future. The best that we can do is to strengthen our Intelligence system and our own war potential (output capacity), so as to be able to increase our forces correspondingly in the case of a German increase. But, although we have included recommenda-tions for both these purposes, we can give no assurance, especially in regard to aircraft production, that we may not be at a serious disadvantage compared with Germany.The Danger of Sudden Attack (particularly by Air).131. Another difficulty is the increasing danger of sudden attack upon this country, which has always been recognised to apply with special force to the case of Germany. In 1907-08 a very strong Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, under Mr. Asquith&apos;s Chairmanship, which was considering Lord Roberts&apos;s case on the risks of invasion by Germany, after exhaustive examination reached the conclusion That the possibility of a surprise attack being made upon this country during normal diplomatic relations is not sufficiently remote to be ignored. They agree with Mr. Balfour that if the German Government believed that the adoption of such a plan made the difference between failure and success it is conceivable that they might resort to it.&quot;The above conclusion was mentioned by Mr. Asquith in a speech in the House of Commons on the 29th July, 1909, and was endorsed by another equally strong Sub-Committee under Mr. Asquith&apos;s Chairmanship in 1913-14.132. German behaviour since 1913 has done nothing to weaken the above authoritative opinion. Whatever may be the correct view as to a surprise attack &quot; during normal diplomatic relations,&quot; a sudden attack when relations are somewhat strained (as they have been for months between Italy and ourselves) cannot be ruled out, more particularly if sanctions were being applied.133.   Whatever the risk of sudden attack, the form it would take to-day is infinitely more serious than it was before the war.   In 1914 the worst risk was [12270] F 2
considered to be an invasion or raid across a sea which our superior naval forces would have rapidly controlled. To this must now be added the risk of an air attack of great, and possibly unknown, strength. No doubt Germany would have to weigh the effect of a sudden air attack on world opinion and its reaction on herself; but if successful it would fulfil the Teutonic conception of a short, sharp war, and we do not see how it could be excluded from the range of possibilities. We are not suggesting that the danger of sudden attack is such that it must be met, any more than it was before the Great War, by maintaining our forces continuously on the alert, but in our view it should enjoin a relatively high level of readiness and of vigilance on the part of the Government, the Foreign Office and the Defence Departments.The Importance of Public Morale.134. An important factor in a German decision to make a sudden aggression would be their estimate of its effect upon our own population. For centuries our people have been exempt from risk of armed invasion or occupation, which weighs so heavily on Continental peoples and to some extent prepares their minds for endurance. As a nation we are still free from the dangers and ignominy of armed invasion or occupation, but our Capital and our principal&apos; cities and manufacturing districts are in some respects as exposed to air attack as those of most Continental nations. We are confident that our people are at least as capable of enduring such attacks as any other race; but their minds must have been steeled by foreknowledge and by understanding of what to expect and what to do to minimise casualties; they must feel that the utmost is being done for their protection and defence; and they must be encouraged by the certainty that the people who have unloosed this brutality are being themselves made to feel what it is like, in equal or greater degree.135. In our previous Report (D.R.C. 14, also CP. 64 (34), paragraph 162) we drew attention to the state of moral disarmament of the population. Since then a good deal has been done by the Government to improve the position; for example, by the increased Programmes, the White Paper on Defence, Debates in Parliament, the launching of the Air Raid Precautions Scheme, and speeches by Ministers. But, as recruiting figures testify, much remains to be done to awaken the public mind to the realities of the situation, and the campaign for the enlightenment of public opinion must be continued in a spirit not of panic, but of realism. In particular, we suggest that the importance of defence should be emphasised in our educational system at least to the same extent as, and indeed as an integral element in, the propaganda for peace and the League of Nations that is carried on to-day in our schools.Co-operation of Government Departments.136. The Defence Services will need in the future even greater support on the part of Ministers and Departments if the proposed programmes are to have a prospect of success. For example, as is well known, the recruiting situation in the Army is very unsatisfactory and certain approaches to the Ministry of Labour to enlist their co-operation have not proved successful. It was suggested that recruits could be attracted to the Army in connection with the schemes for the relief of the Depressed Areas, but on enquiry it was found that no encouragement could be given to active steps at Training Camps and Centres to induce men to enlist. Whilst it is not for us to comment on this policy, which is quoted as an example, we feel strongly that unless the full co-operation of all the Departments of State is freely given there is the likelihood of delay, if not of failure, in our proposals for the rehabilitation of the Services.137. Another aspect of the recruiting figures which merits the attention of the Government in several of its Departments is the high percentage of rejections of applicants for physical or medical reasons, which over a term of ten years from 1923 never fell below 50 per cent. In the year ending the 30th September, 1934, no less than 68 per cent, of the applicants for the Army were rejected on account of physical, educational or other defects, * which is not flattering to the standard of physique of the rising generation.   We suggest that the attention* cmd.. 4821 (1935), paragraph 2.
373 U 4of the Ministry of Health, the corresponding Department in the Scottish Office, the Medical Research Council and the Board of Education (from the point of view of physical training) be drawn to the vital importance to Imperial Defence of an improved physical standard in the population.Conclusion.138. We should like, in conclusion, to say that we are fully conscious of the very heavy expenditure over the next few years which our proposals involve, even though those proposals are based on a reasonable appreciation of the inter-national situation and do not provide a margin for all the possible contingencies mentioned in this section of our Report. But we are convinced that the situation, both present and prospective, which we have had to review is grave enough to require the most resolute effort on the part of this country, and that there can be no salvation in half-measures. Except in so far as the country has in the years since the war allowed its defences to deteriorate progressively, the situation is none of our making; look in what direction we may, we find a world increasingly nationalistic, armed to the teeth, and influenced by rapacity and the doctrine of force.-139. The British Empire, as perhaps the extreme illustration of the &quot;haves &quot; of life, is not unnaturally exposed to &apos;&apos; the envy of less happier lands.&quot; If then, as we believe, England and the Empire have still a contribution to make to civilisation, and their survival is, therefore, worth while, we feel that additional insurance against the accumulating dangers is the alternative to the epitaph &quot;England hath made a shameful conquest of itself.&quot;
XL Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.140. Our conclusions and recommendations may be summed up as follows :--(1) The system of collective security provided by the Covenant of the League-of Nations, which has been adopted by successive Governments with strong popular support as the basis of our foreign policy, has been shown by recent events to complicate the calculation of defence requirements. The Manchurian episode of 1931-33, and more especially the Italo-Abyssinian affair, show that this system is liable (a) to involve this country, as the only great sea-power in the League, inunforeseen commitments at very short notice; (&amp;) to embitter our relations, almost without warning, with countries likeJapan, Italy and France, with whom we had deliberately cultivatedclose relations in order to exclude them from the range of possibleenemies; and(e) to produce unexpected reactions on our own security for which we were totally unprepared (e.g., in the Far East in 1931-33; in the Mediterranean in 1935).  (Paragraphs 10 to 15.)(2) From the point of view of national and imperial security it should be a cardinal principle to avoid a situation in which we might be confronted simul-taneously with the hostility, open or veiled, of Japan in the Far East, Germany in the West, and any Power on the line of communications between the two. (Paragraph 16.)(3) Recent events accentuate the importance of a policy of accommodation and friendliness with Japan as recommended in our first Report. (Paragraph 16.) Similarly as regards Germany it is very desirable that we should respond as favourably as circumstances permit though circumstances are likely to impose a concrete limit to Herr Hitler &apos;s desire to be on good terms with this country and that we should do everything we can, in conjunction with France, to promote and maintain friendly relations with Germany. (Paragraph 17.) .&apos; &apos; (4) Before Italy can so far recover from her present embarrassments as to become a permanent factor in calculating our defence requirements, our long-range policy should be so aligned as to ensure that we shall never be in a position of hostility to Japan and Italy at the same time, to say nothing of Germany, without the certainty of French military support.  (Paragraph 18.)(5) The outstanding feature of recent world events is that a strong Britain is essential to the peace of the world. The policy of collective security contained in the Covenant can only succeed under the leadership of a strong and re-equipped Britain. With that backing the League would be a far more effective instrument for the maintenance of peace and as a deterrent to war than it is to-day. To the League system of collective security the alternatives are a more limited system of collective security on the Locarno model; the pre-war system of alliances and ententes; or isolation. For any of these systems to prove effective our armaments must be raised to a far more effective standard than has hitherto been aimed at. (Paragraphs 19 to 23.)(6) The following new considerations affecting the calculation of our Defence-Requirements have arisen : (a) As the result of the principle of collective security our forces must bemore ready than before; (&amp;) There is now the possibility of a hostile Italy on our main line of imperial communications;(c) As the one big Naval Power of the League of Nations, we may have toexhaust ourselves to the detriment of the balance of security against Japan and Germany, who are outside it;(d) As a result of the assumption by Germany of the right to build up a newnavy free of the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles, the Navy of that country (though fortunately now limited to 35 per cent, of our own strength) has to be taken into account;(e) In view of the enormously increased capacity of output by Germany,there is the possibility of attack from the air so continuous and concen-trated, and on such a scale, that a few weeks of that experience might so undermine the morale of any civilian population as to make it difficult for the Government to continue the war.   (Paragraph 25.)
(7) With reference to (6) (&amp;) above, the eventual position vis-a-vis Italy is as yet too obscure to appraise in terms of defence requirements. The situation will have to be watched carefully and a close study of the strategical problem in the Mediterranean will have to be made. In any event, it would be materially impossible, within the three-year period with which this Report is primarily concerned, to make additional provision for a hostile Italy. For these reasons we have limited ourselves to the same hypotheses as in our first Report (D.R.C. 14, also CP. 64 (34)), namely, the provision of an adequate deterrent to Germany and Japan, and a protection to the United Kingdom and the Empire in these two contingencies.   (Paragraphs 27-29.)(8) The standards of security at which we should aim are as follows :  Navy.A new standard of naval strength defined as follows :-(i) to enable us to place a Fleet in the Far East fully adequate to act on the defensive and to serve as a strong deterrent against any threat to our interests in that part of the globe;(ii) to maintain in all. circumstances in Home Waters a force able to meet therequirements of a war with Germany at the same time.Included in (i) and (ii) should be the forces necessary in all parts of the world, behind the cover of the main fleets, to protect our territories and merchant ships against sporadic attack.A rmy.(i) To maintain garrisons overseas on the present general basis for purposes of Imperial Defence;(ii) to provide for the military share in Home Defence, which includesanti-aircraft defence, Coast Defence and internal security;(iii) to enable us to provide reinforcements and/or a Field Force from home in time of emergency or war, with adequate equipment and reserves.Under (i) and (ii) the most important requirements are a substantial improve-ment in coast defences at Naval bases at Home and Abroad, and the completion of the Army&apos;s share in the Air Defence of Great Britain.Under (iii) the most important requirement is to organise a Field Force which can be sent abroad at short notice for the protection of our vital interests, and to enable us to honour our international obligations, particularly under the Treaty of Locarno, which would involve effective co-operation with other signatories on the Continent of Europe. This includes the occupation for ourselves and the denial to the enemy of an advanced air base in the Low Countries.Air Force.We regard as a minimum the strength already decided for the Royal Air Force at Home, viz. : 123 squadrons (1,512 first-line aircraft) to be completed by April 1937. This figure was based on the assumption that by that date the number of German first-line aircraft will amount to some 1,500. In the absence of any agreement for the limitation of air forces there is, however, no guarantee that she will not build up to an even higher figure of first-line strength. It is therefore vital that the position should be kept under the closest continuous review.In addition we propose -(i) Provision of war reserves, without which the Air Force could only fight for a very short time; (ii) strengthening of the air forces overseas and, in particular, those &apos;   required to meet the possibility of war with. Japan in the Far East;(iii) additions to the Fleet Air Arm to correspond to the naval programme;(iv) additions to the Army Co-operation Squadrons  (mainly auxiliarysquadrons) to provide the requirements of the four contingents of the Field Force.For all Three Services.An effective scheme for the expansion of industry in time of war and provision of reserves of war material sufficient to maintain them from the outset of war until industry is able to supply their needs from current output.   (Paragraph 34.)
Navy Programme and Requirements.(9) The naval programme required to carry out the new standard of naval strength proposed above cannot be worked out at present, as it depends upon the programmes of other Powers and upon the information which may be available after the Naval Conference. In any event, it is impossible to increase the Navy to the new standard within the next three years owing to difficulties of material and personnel unless resort is made to extraordinary measures such as those adopted in the case of the Royal Air Force expansion, which, in the opinion of the Admiralty, would prejudice the efficiency of the Service.   (Paragraphs 37 to 41.)We strongly recommend, however, that during the next few years ships should be laid down early in the financial year instead of in the last quarter as at present.   (Paragraph 42.)(10) For the time being we must concentrate on the requirements of the existing approved standard, doing.all we can at the same time to prepare for a fresh programme to bring the Navy up to the new standard if it is approved by the Government. We recommend that the Government should at once approve the new standard in principle and instruct the Admiralty (i) to work out the naval programme required to give effect to it as soon asthe necessary data are available; and(ii) to make suggestions as to any items in the new programme that can beput in hand before the expiration of the next three years. These Will probably be limited by material considerations to the smaller classes of warship.(Paragraphs 43 and 44.)(11) To complete the needs of the existing approved standard the programme we recommend includes : 7 capital ships to be laid down in the period 1937-39 (2-3-2). (Para-graphs 46 and 47.)4 aircraft carriers (some of a smaller type) to be laid down in the period 1936-42.   (Paragraph 48.)5 cruisers a year between 1936 and 1939.   (Paragraph 49.)1 destroyer flotilla in 1936-37 and thereafter 1 flotilla in alternate years up to 1942.   (Paragraph 50.)Submarines, sloops, other small craft and auxiliaries at the same rate as in the past, that is to say about 3 submarines and 5 or 6 sloops a year. (Paragraph 51.)(12) The cost of the above construction programme is approximately  19^ million in 1936, rising to  36^ million in 1939. Thereafter it should fall, but only if the quantitative restrictions of the Naval Treaties are renewed. Other-wise it may increase. If the new standard of naval strength is adopted an increased programme will be required involving additional expenditure not yet calculable.   (Paragraphs 52 and 53.)(13) The naval deficiency programme includes : Complete modernisation for 3 capital ships. Partial modernisation for 4 capital ships.(Further modernisation if quantitative restrictions are not renewed and other nations retain their older capital ships.)Construction of a further Boys Training Establishment.35,600 increase in personnel between 1936 and 1942.Fleet Air Arm increase from 190 (the present figure) to 504 by 1942. (Paragraphs 55 to 64.)Army Programme and Reqtiirements.(14) The Army Programmes and requirements include : Field Force: First Contingent (Regular Army). 4 Divisions.1 Mobile Division (6 mechanised Cavalry Regiments and a Tank Brigade with supporting arms and services).
3 new Army Tank Battalions (making, with the existing Battalion, one for each division).Speeding up mobilisation arrangements to enable the Mobile Division and Air Defence Brigades to be disembarked on the Continent in a week, and the remainder of the first contingent a week later.   (Paragraphs 65 to 67.)Second, Third and Fourth Contingents (Territorial Army).Second Contingent of 4 Divisions at 4 months after the outbreak ofwar.Third Contingent of 4 Divisions at 6 months after the outbreak ofwar.Fourth Contingent of 4 Divisions at 8 months after the outbreak ofwar.(Paragraph 68.)Modernisation of the Territorial Army at a cost of  26,000,000, the previous suggested allotment of  250,000 a year being retained for improve-ment of training and efficiency.   (Paragraph 69.)Ammunition reserves for the earlier contingents.   (Paragraph 70.)Coast Defence Modernisation at home and abroad.   (Paragraph 71.)Air Defence of Great Britain to be within sight of completion in five years.   (Paragraphs 72 and 73.)An increase of 4 infantry battalions as an instalment of a possible eventual increase of 12 (or 14) battalions.   (Paragraph 74.)Re-equipment of the Field Artillery by converting the 18-pdr. gun to take a 25-lb. shell (with increase of range to 12,000 yards), which will replace both the 18-pounder field gun (range 9,000 yards) and 4.5-inch howitzer (range 6,500 yards).Ammunition for the above.   (Paragraphs 75 to 77.)Improvement in Housing conditions.   (Paragraph 78.)Air Force Programme and Requirements.(15) The Air Force Programme and Requirements include (paragraph 80): (i) Completion of the expansion programme as at present approved so as to increase our metropolitan first-line air strength to 123 squadrons (1,512 aircraft) by April 1937. (ii) Army Co-operation squadrons to accompany the field forces on the following scale :- First Contingent (regular), 7 squadrons (each of 12 aircraft), together with one squadron for communication purposes.Second Contingent (territorial) (after 4 months), 4 or 5 squadrons;Third Contingent (territorial) (after 6 months), 4 or 5 squadrons;Fourth Contingent (territorial) (after 8 months), to be raised on mobilisation.The above involves raising 4 new regular bomber squadrons and 4 new auxiliary squadrons, and possibly 2 additional Territorial squadrons later.(iii) A first-line strength of 504 aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm and furthershore accommodation at home and abroad.(iv) Additional aircraft at overseas stations amounting to 13 squadrons and2 or more Spotter Flights, viz. : Singapore. An extra land-plane squadron and 2 additional landing grounds.Penang, Ceylon and Aden. One land-plane squadron apiece to co-operate with and assist the Navy.Hong Kong. 3 squadrons, 1 spotter flight, 1 repair unit and an additional aerodrome.Middle East. An addition of 1 General Purpose Squadron. [12270] - G
r &apos; Malta. 2 squadrons and 1 spotter flight as the ultimate strength,subject to later consideration as proposed in paragraph 29.West A frica-1 General Purpose Squadron and an aerodrome. East A frica.- 1 General Purpose Squadron.West Indies. 1 reconnaissance (flying boat or land-plane) squadron.Gibraltar. An aerodrome to provide an intermediate air base on an &quot; All British &apos;&apos; air route to Malta and the Far East.Certain of the above proposals must be regarded as provisional since they are dependent on the outcome of the international situation. (Paragraphs 80 to 82.) (v) War Reserves. In order to bridge the gap between the outbreak of war and the time at which industry can meet wastage A war reserve of aircraft (amounting to 150 per cent, of first-line strength);Four months&apos; supply, additional to the above, of airframes and engines for additional flying training schools to be established on the outbreak of war to maintain the supply of pilots;A reserve of six months&apos; supply of bombs, small arm ammunition and pyrotechnics;For motor transport initial requirements with reserve of technical vehicles not readily obtainable from civilian sources. (Paragraphs 83 to 86.)(vi) Storage for reserves and the provision of jigs and tools for manufactureof aircraft!   (Paragraph 87.) (vii) Personnel. A further entry to the Royal Air Force Reserve of 600 Pilots a year for the next three years, additional to the 200 a year to / &apos; which the Air Ministry are now working.   (Paragraph 88.)Industrial Production.(16) The only method by which very large deficiencies in war material can be supplied and an adequate &apos;&apos; war potential &apos;&apos; built up is by the creation of a &quot; Shadow Armament Industry &quot; (paragraph 91), Which will demand ah approved long-term programme of rearmament, continuity of orders, Government: assistance and greater recourse to non-competitive contracts (paragraph 92). In this connection certain problems will arise, notably- -    ,&quot;the provision of additional machinery, methods of collaboration with the industry, provision of labour, the prevention of profiteering and the allocation of firms to defence departments (paragraph 93),. and the extension of Government factories (paragraph 94).(17) The cost of the industrial measures recommended is. necessarily conjectural; the suggested figure for the War Office is  16,000,000, for the Air Ministry  10,100,000, but these figures are dependent on the success attending the policy of expanding industry.   (Paragraph 95.)(18) The state of preparedness which would be achieved by the end of 1938-39 if no special measures are instituted for increasing factory output are dealt with in paragraphs 96-98. The Army would be the most adversely affected since the first contingent of the Field Force would still be short by 50 per cent, of its present deficiencies and also have no &quot;war potential&quot; behind. it. In the absence of this &quot;war potential,&quot; stocks would have to be built up gradually to a value of  150- 200 million. (Paragraph 97.) For the Royal Air Force the enlargement of the sources of production which is necessary to carry out by 1937 the expansion programme already authorised will (it is anticipated) substantially provide by 1939 the further numbers of aircraft and engines required to build up war reserves. The  10,100,000 referred to in (17) above is required to enable sources of production not employed in satisfying Air Force requirements in peace to turn over to war production without delay in an emergency.   (Paragraph 98.)(19) In the most favourable conditions it will be impossible to carry out the full programme of supply for the emergency of war by the 31st March, 1939. (Paragraph 100.)
Miscellaneous Requirements.(20) In Section VIII of this Report we have drawn attention to develop-ments Which will require attention in the near future, of which the most important are (i) Provision of requirements for Air Raid Precautions,- e.g&apos;!, gas masks for the civilian population and other anti-gas equipment. (Paragraphs 102 and 103.)(ii) Dangers to which our vital industries are liable from air attack, and notably the importance of Woolwich, Billingham and Ardeer in this connection.   (Paragraphs 104 and 105.)(iii) Increased provision for the Secret Service.   (Paragraph 106.)(iv) Armed merchant cruisers and defensively equipped merchant ships.Certain limitations are at present imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. If these limitations are not repeated in any future Treaty the position will need reconsideration.   (Paragraph 107.)(v) The desirability of encouraging commercial air enterprises.   (Para-graph 108.)(vi) The importance of maintaining at the highest state of efficiency theRegular and Auxiliary forces in the Colonies, Mandated Territories,&amp;c.   (Paragraph 109.) (vii) The need for drawing the attention of the Dominions to the measuresto be undertaken in this country and for inviting their co-operation.(Paragraph 110.)(viii) The need for remedying deficiencies in India.   (Paragraph 111.)Costs and Finance.(21) The proposals of this Report would result in an increased annual expenditure over the  124 million (original Estimates) voted for the defence services in 1935 of the order of :  1936      ............... 49,650,0001937     ............... 86,750,0001938      ..........       ....... 102,400,0001939      ............      ... 88,450,0001940     ...      ............ 90,050,000A total of  417^ million over the five-year period, of which  239 million is in the next 3 years. All figures are, however, necessarily speculative, and are merely an attempt to indicate the order of magnitude of the expenditure. (Paragraphs 112-114.)(22) In addition are the costs for air raids precautions equipment, approxi-mately  5 million (paragraph 115), an increase to million per annum for the Secret Service (paragraph 116) and a number of outstanding matters on which it is not possible to make recommendations or frame costs at the present time (paragraph 117).General.(23) We recommend in general that every possible step should be taken to bring home to the people of this country an understanding of the international situation and the need for sacrifices, both personal and financial, in order to provide the defence forces and defences essential to security. In particular we recommend (a) that the importance of defence should be emphasised in our educational system at least to the same extent as, and as an integral element in the propaganda for peace and the League of Nations, that is carried on to-day in our schools.

(Paragraph 137.)(24) Our Report is based on a reasonable estimate of what is required to meet our responsibilities in respect of the security of the Empire, and does not provide a margin for every conceivable danger, such as an unexpectedly rapid increase in the naval strength of Japan or the air strength of Germany; a sudden attack in time of normal diplomatic relations such as was deemed possible before the war.

Items for Singapore provisionally estimated in 1934 to cost  900,000now estimated to cost  1,734,000.(d) The provision for War Reserves includes the following sums in respect of such Reserves for the Fleet Air Arm, viz.: 1936:  500,000; 1937:  1,700,000&quot;1938:  1,700,000; 1939-40:  2,900,000.   Total:  6,800,000.* These figures show the provision which would be necessary if the exigencies of the international situation require that the bulk of the provision for essential War Reserves should be completed by the 31st March, 1939. A very steep deoline in output would ensue after that date which would necessarily have serious reactions, e.g., a wholesale discharge of labour would be inevitable. If, therefore, the international situation permits it would be desirable to effect a more gradual spread of this expenditure, and carry forward a larger proportion beyond 1938-39.Table IIIb.

It is expected that in the financial year 1941 a sum of about  5,000,000 will be required to replace obsolete or deteriorated war reserves and a similar amount in each subsequent year.Table IIIc.

34 r-l DProgrammes of the Defence Services. Interim Report.ON the 8th July, 1935, the Ministerial Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Defence Policy and Requirements invited the Defence Requirements Committee to re-examine, in the light of the situation set forth in Paper No. D.P.R. 6,* and with special reference to financial co-ordination, the programmes of the Navy, Army and Air Force, and to make recommendations for the future.2. We have held two meetings and have made a preliminary survey of the programme of defence requirements in the light of the present and prospective international situation. As a result we have decided to submit an interim Report asking for confirmation of our own views and seeking further guidance before proceeding to work out in detail fresh programmes of defence requirements.3. Our preliminary survey has already revealed a number of additional requirements, some of which were foreseen in our original Report as liable to arise, while others have matured as the result of fresh developments. They include the following : ,(i) Naval increases, such as the additional sum for the modernisation of4 capital ships which was reported to the Ministerial Committee last July and increased equipments for the A/A armament of the fleet. In addition, Germany&apos;s decision to re-build her fleet by the end of 1942 (limited though her fleet fortunately now is to 35 per cent, of our own) necessitates a more rapid replacement of our old ships.This is most marked in the case of the capital ship category in which, by the end of 1942, Germany may possess 5 new ships whereas as the result of the postponement of replacement under the London Naval Treaty 11 of our 15 existing capital ships would be 26 years or more old at that time. Lack of manufacturing facilities enhances the importance of an early decision. For example, at present there are in the whole country only four gun pits for the erection of the largest gun mountings.(ii) The Army programme, which was cut down by half by the lateMinisterial Committee on Defence Requirements, reveals very heavy deficiencies. Without additional expenditure the Field Force will not be able to fulfil its responsibilities for many years, and this is even more true of the Territorial Army, for which a less than meagre pittance has been provided. As an example, the requirements of the Field Force in material (apart from ammunition) were estimated, in the original Report of the Defence Requirements Committee, at  14,820,000. At the present approved rate of provision, on the 1st April, 1939, over  9^ millions will still be outstanding.The reconstruction of the German Navy necessitates some speeding up of the programme for renovating coast defences at home, which has been cut down to annual instalments so small as actually to involve 100 years for the completion of the modest approved scheme.The serious and concrete threat to Anglo-Italian relations that has developed owing to the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, reveals the risk of delaying too long the reconditioning of the coast and air defences of Mediterranean ports. The Italians have for long been outspokenly aware of these weaknesses.Certain additional defences may be required for Hong Kong and Singapore beyond those for which provision was recommended in the previous Report.* Also Paper No. D.R.C. 22.D.R.C. 25.(4 foe Pa^r -Afo. D.P.R. 12.)ANNEX.
(iii) The plans for the extension of the Air Defence of Great Britain, whichare now before the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Require-ments, involve a further heavy expenditure, whatever may be the decision as to the year of completion to be aimed at.(iv) The provision of adequate reserves for the Royal Air Force is anessential defence requirement. Without reserves of bombs and machines the Royal Air Force would remain effective as a fighting force only for a few weeks in the event of hostilities. Sooner or later the lack of reserves will become known to Germany, and probably more widely, and the deterrent effect of the recent increases to the Royal Air Force will be discounted, (v) Considerable expenditure On machine tools, jigs, gauges and so forth will be required in the near future if industrial mobilisation is to be a reality. The position in respect of shells and air bombs is particularly disquieting.The completion of the above deficiencies will require large sums over and above those included in our original report.4. The international situation affords no comfort. It has deteriorated even since the 7th June, when the Report referred to in our Terms of Reference (D.P.R. 6) was completed. The situation in the Far East remains superficially unchanged, and the attitude of Japan has not become any more reassuring. There have, indeed, been recent signs that the military hotheads are in undiminished power and capable as ever of forcing the hand of a not unwilling civil government. Japanese naval and military preparations are well advanced, and for this reason 1936 and subsequent years, when our own preparations will still be backward, are particularly dangerous years. Moreover, there is increasing evidence of a rapprochement between Japan and Germany. It is probable, in fact, that this will become more open in the near future.5. In Europe the international situation provides no ground for optimism. Since our original Report was presented in February 1934 the evidence of German rearmament in the air has compelled the Government to adopt plans for the expansion of the Royal Air Force greatly exceeding our own recommen-dations. The recent naval conversations, though satisfactory in so far as they have curtailed the strength of the German Navy to 35 per cent, of our own, have confirmed the impression of Germany&apos;s intention to rearm almost regardless of cost. In this connection the Treasury have received information confirming, and indeed tending to increase, the estimate given in D.C.M. (32) 145, paragraph 13,* of  1,000 million a year as the rate of German borrowing, mainly, of course, for expenditure on armaments.6. Meanwhile, the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia threatens to weaken the unity of the nations that can hold German ambitions in check. It is to be apprehended also that, as German strength increases, there will be a tendency for her to attract satellite nations into her orbit and away from the other Powers. Examples of this tendency are already to be found in the case of Poland and, to a lesser extent, Yugoslavia,.7. In drawing up a programme we have to consider not only our own deficiencies, but also the date by which they ought to be made good a matter that is now before the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements. On this subject we should like to offer the following observations, in the hope that they may assist the Sub-Committee in reaching a conclusion before the Parliamentary recess.8.   The date has to be determined&quot; by two principal considerations : (i) The date at which Germany-the &apos;&apos; firebrand &apos;&apos; of Europe will have completed her preparations to the point at which she would be able to launch an aggression, (ii) The international factor.9. So far as the German Navy is concerned, the Chief of the Naval Staff thinks that, in view of the technical difficulties involved in naval construction on a large scale over a period of years, the statements made during the recent Anglo-* Attached to Paper No. D.P.R. 6.
German Conversations that Germany aimed at her new fleet being ready by the end of 1942 can be accepted; in any case, it would be difficult for the German Navy to be completed and trained to a war standard before 1942. &apos;10. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff has furnished us with figures, obtained from reliable sources, which indicate that by the year 1939 the numerical strength of the German Army on a war footing will nearly approach that of the French Army. By the year 1942 the Germans will possess a marked numerical superiority. The rate of expansion is believed to depend largely on the rate at which war material can be provided. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff will communicate the figures on which this statement is based, which are very secret, to the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements.11. As far as Air Forces are concerned, both Hitler and Goering have recently made statements to the effect that they hoped to attain parity with France in the air, at a figure of approximately 2,000 first line aircraft, by the end of this year. Whilst it is not considered that this is within the bounds of possibility if first line strength, as we use the term in this country, is to be taken as the basis, yet there is no reason why Germany should not build up a first line strength of 1,500 aircraft by April 1937, organised in Squadrons, with pilots who have completed their individual training, and backed by an industry organised for war production on a big scale. This achievement in so short a time would only be possible in a country dragooned under a Nazi system. If an agreement for limitation of Air Forces cannot be reached at a figure of 1,500 first-line strength, Germany will undoubtedly continue to expand up to 2,000 first-line strength, and there is no reason why she should not do this by the end of 1938. Although a strength of 1,500 in 1937 or 2,000 in 1938 may be reached, it is unlikely that the Squadrons will be fully trained as such, or that the German Air Force as a whole will be provided with fully trained and experienced subordinate Commanders.We can assume that, whatever the strength of the German Air Force, France will accept nothing less than numerical parity, so that, against any combination of Powers, Germany will be in a position of numerical inferiority in the air. Against this, however, we must offset the fact that in technical excellency, in training and in industrial organisation France will tend to lag behind the all-round efficiency of Nazi Germany and, further, as far as we ourselves are concerned, we must offset the fact that the comparative vulnerability to air attack of this country and of germany operates, and must always operate, greatly in favour of the latter.12. From the technical military point of view, therefore (using the term in its widest significance), it would seem improbable that the German forces as a whole could reach that state of completion, readiness, training and experience, which would logically justify their leaders (especially after the experience of 1914-18) in deliberately launching an aggression before 1942.13. It must be remembered, however, that Germany is living under an autocracy; that, apparently, she has control of unlimited funds to spend on her defence forces; and. that industry can be diverted to the production of war material to any extent desired. In these circumstances Germany can do things that are impossible for us, working under peace conditions. We must be on our guard, therefore, against under-estimating German capacity.Germany, as the potential aggressor, can select her own date for the war, and so lay out the development of her training and production of material that it reaches its peak at the moment chosen by themselves. This gives Germany all the advantages of the possessor of the initiative where the preparation for war is concerned.14. Readiness, moreover, is a relative term. If the nations that act as a deterrent to Germany, and particularly the United Kingdom, remain in their present state of unpreparedness, Germany might easily decide to take advantage of some opportunity or pretext to embark on some political adventure, perhaps against some minor objective such as Memel, perhaps on a more ambitious scale in Eastern or Central Europe. The position m Europe is at present so obscure that it is impossible to say that no such opportunity can arise, or that psycho-logical possibilities of this kind can be ignored. The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considers it impossible to guarantee the political
peace of Europe until 1942. Germany is not likely to go to war by calculation before 1942, but she might do so by miscalculation or political error of judgment. He distinguishes between a likely date (e.g., one governed by military considera-tions) and a date beyond which the maintenance of peace could not be assumed. He regards the 1st January, 1939, as the latest date which could reasonably be assumed for the purpose of our own security, and it could not be guaranteed that Germany would remain politically quiescent until then; to accept any date beyond 1939 would be to run a big risk.First Recommendation.15. On a review of these considerations, and taking into account the unsatisfactory state of our industry for rapid production of armaments, we agree that it is not safe to postpone the date at which we should aim at a reasonable state of preparedness beyond January 1939 which only gives us three budget years.16. The present dangerous position of our defence forces and defences results from the juxtaposition of rearmament by Germany at an unprecedented rate with low-water mark in our own armaments resulting from the policy of successive Governments since the war. Whether the year at which we aim is 1939, as suggested above, or 1942, we do not believe it is possible to achieve a state of preparedness which would constitute an effective deterrent or defence within the limits of increases of expenditure in the annual estimates of the Defence Services. We see no prospect of being able to submit acceptable or realisable programmes on that basis. We know that Germany is financing her preparations by loans on an immense scale, and that the same is being done in varying degrees by other countries. If then this country is to equip itself adequately for its own security and to discourage aggression, we can see no alternative but for the Government to widen its horizon and to resort to some system of capital expenditure for this purpose.Second Recommendation.17. In spite of the urgency of the question we feel it would hardly be reasonable on our part to ask for a decision on this large question of Government policy before the recess. For the moment, therefore, all we request is authority to work out the programmes entrusted to us on the basis that they are to be completed as early as possible financial considerations to be of secondary importance to the earliest possible security and that by the end of the financial year 1938-39 each Service shall have advanced its readiness to the greatest extent that physical conditions permit with normal peace time practice, or by such other date as the Cabinet or the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements may decide, leaving for later consideration by the Government the question of how the finance is to be met. If we are authorised to proceed on this basis we will do our best to produce programmes to meet the national need, but we must enter a caveat that, the present state of our manufacturing resources will very definitely limit what it is possible to do in the time available.(Signed) M.

SCHEDULE I TO D.R.O. 37.Naval Defence Requirements.Memorandum by the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff.1. THE Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements at their meeting* on the 29th July, 1935, agreed &quot; To authorise the Defence Requirements Sub-Committee to work out, for their consideration, programmes on the assumption that by the end of the financial year 1938-39, each service should have advanced its state of readiness to the widest necessary extent in relation to the military needs of National defence and within the limits of practicability.&quot;The memorandum which follows deals with the Defence Requirements of the Navy. While the making good of what has been known as &quot; deficiencies.&quot; Table B of D.R.C. 14, can be largely compressed into the three programme years before the end of the year 1938-39, the broader requirements of the Navy, such as new construction and personnel increases, can only be viewed in their proper perspective if considered over a further period of years and programmes have in consequence generally been carried on to the year 1942.Strategical Considerations.2. In the draft Report of the 1935 Naval Conference Ministerial Committee (N.C.M. (35) 12), which was circulated to the D.C.(M). Committee as D.C.(M) (32) 121, the following Admiralty statement of our minimum naval strategical requirement for security was accepted as the basis of our calculations of Naval strength : &apos;&apos; We should be able to send to the Far East a Fleet sufficient to provide &apos; cover &apos; against the Japanese Fleet; we should have sufficient additional forces behind this shield for the protection of our territory and mercantile marine against Japanese attack; at the same time we should be able to retain in European waters a force sufficient to act as a deterrent and to prevent the strongest European Naval Power from obtaining control of our vital home terminal areas while we can make the necessary redispositions.&quot;3. Since the date (June 1934) when this memorandum was prepared three major events have taken place, which affect our Naval strategical requirements.4. Firstly, as a result of the resumption by Germany of the right to build up a new Navy free of the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles, the Navy of that country (though fortunately now limited by agreement to 35 per cent, of our own strength) has to be taken into account.5. Secondly, events have shown that our membership of the League of Nations may lead us at little notice into a situation where war is within, sight and that a period, of deterioration of relations with a possible adversary, during which our lack of war preparations could be made good, can no longer be depended on.* D.P.R. 4th Meeting, Minute 2.[12270-1]B
6. Thirdly, by the prominent part which our position in the Mediterranean has compelled us to take in connection with the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, we have incurred the hostility of Italy, which feeling may well last for a generation. As a result, it is no longer possible to depend on our old friendship with Italy, and should we be engaged in war in the Far East it is essential that we should be able to maintain our line of communications and uphold our general position in the Mediterranean in the face of a possibly hostile Italy.7. As a result of the changed circumstances mentioned above, it is necessary that, if we had to send a Fleet to the East, we should be able to retain in European waters a considerably more powerful Naval Force than was thought necessary before these circumstances arose.8. Again, the present emergency has brought into clear relief the inadequacy of our Naval forces in many respects, especially with reference to cruisers and destroyers. For a possible war with Italy, which. should, owing to her geographical position, be a simpler problem than a war with any other great power, it has been essential to bring home cruisers, destroyers and submarines from the various stations abroad, including even China, where in the face of Japanese strength we can ill afford any display of weakness.9. In spite of the important factors mentioned, the proposals in this paper do not ask for an expansion of the Royal Navy at the present time to meet these new strategical needs, and they are based on the maintenance of approximately the same number of ships as is aimed at at present, i.e. 15 Capital ships.70 Cruisers (of which 10 can be over-age).16 Flotillas of destroyers (of which 4 can be over-age).It is possible that the action of other Powers or changes in the international situation will make it necessary when we have replaced the existing aged fleet to consider an increase in the strength of the Fleet. In the case of battleships, since the building programme put forward for the next three years is the maximum that we can build, any numerical increase in our battlefleet cannot in any case take place till 1940, and then only by the keeping of old ships instead of scrapping them. This question of possibly having to increase the strength of the Royal Navy is a matter of first-class importance to which I consider the Committee should d ra w attention. &apos;:Revised Requirements of Naval Defence.10.   The revised requirements of Naval defence   which follow in this memorandum result generally from the various considerations mentioned above. The main items of these requirements are as follows : (a) Naval Construction (Appendix No. 1).The estimated cost of the new construction required to enable the Fleet to fulfil its duties is given in Appendix No. 1.This programme shows a considerably increased rate of financial expenditure over that given in Appendix 1 to D.R.C. Paper No. 14, and the reasons for the main increases are explained in detail in the notes on Appendix No. 1.In this connection, attention is again directed to the connection between new construction and modernisation of old ships. Owing to the more rapid replace-ment of capital ships now required to meet the building of other Powers, it is possible to make an actual reduction in the number of ships to be modernised.:-(b) Navy Deficiency Programme (Appendix No. 2).This programme is contained in Appendix No. 2. It is, in general, arranged in the same manner as the Navy Deficiency Programme contained in Table B of D.R.C. 14, and deals with the same matters, e.g., modernisation of capital ships, anti-submarine equipment, reserves of ammunition, stores, &amp;o, except thatxx. A.
personnel and Fleet Air Arm are now excluded (see Items (c) and; (d) below), and a new item for various works (Item 17) has been added. For convenience of reference, however, the same numbers have been retained for the various other items as were used in D.R.C. 14.The figures in general show an increase over those contained in D.R.C. 14. Details of changes from the previous figures, and the reasons for such changes, are contained in the notes on Appendix No. 2.In accordance with the decision of the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee that &quot;by the end of the year 1938-39 each of the defence services should have advanced its state of readiness to the widest necessary extent in relation to the military needs of national defence and within the limits of practicability &quot; the provision for making good the above deficiency has so far as practicable been inserted under the programme years 1936, 1937, 1938. There remains, however, a certain balance which it would not be possible to spend in these years.(c) Personnel (Appendix No. 3).The figures for personnel are given in Appendix No. 3. They provide in general for an expansion of strength of some 35,600, spread over the years 1936-1942. This number of men will enable the present deficiency to be met as well as the increase necessary in connection with the remaining proposals in this paper, and when it is completed in 1942 the total personnel of the Navy will be 130,000, as compared with the present totals for the U.S.A. of 122,000 and for Japan of 1.14,245.In order to enable this increase of personnel to be made, it is essential that the provision of the third Boys&apos; training establishment, provided for in Item 17 of Appendix No. 2, shall be authorised as soon as possible.Attention is particularly called to this point.N.B. -Personnel figures of Japan can NOT be quoted publicly.(d) Fleet Air Arm (Appendix No. 4).In the estimates of requirements contained in D.R.C. 14, provision for the Fleet Air Arm was divided between the &quot;deficiency&quot; programme dealt with in (b) above and a separate programme to meet requirements of new construction. In the present memorandum the cost of aircraft for new battleship and cruiser construction is included in the cost of the Naval Construction Programme shown in Appendix No. 1. The figures of cost in Appendix No. 4 cover the provision of aircraft for new aircraft carriers and for rearmament of or completion of existing flights and also for the maintenance of the Fleet Air Arm during the period of expansion.In addition to the requirements contained in Appendix No. 4, the Admiralty consider that a Fleet Air Arm Base ashore is a vital requirement for the efficiency of the Fleet Air Arm. It is realised that this is a matter which will require prior consultation between the Admiralty and the Air Ministry, and the proposal is only mentioned at this stage because to omit it from this general review of naval defence requirements would be misleading. The Admiralty estimate that the cost of this base would be some  5,000,000. This estimate is mentioned without prejudice to the principle of whether the provision would finally appear in Naval or Air Estimates and as the scheme is at present only tentative it is not included in the Summary of estimates of cost, and no actual proposals for carrying out the work are made at the moment.(e) Possible Base in Cyprus (Appendix No. 5).The question of a possible base in Cyprus to supplement our base facilities in the Mediterranean in the event of a war with Italy or France is discussed in Appendix No. 5.This proposal raises many big questions and while an estimate of cost is attached to Appendix No. 5 no actual proposals for carrying out the work are made at this stage and nothing is included for this purpose in the summary of estimates of cost.[12270-1] b 2
October 9, 1935.11. Appendix No. 6 shows the total expenditure in excess of the Navy Estimates for 1935 that would follow directly from the proposals contained in this memorandum (except that in regard to a Base in Cyprus and the Fleet Air Arm Base) in each of the years 1936-1942. Allowance must, however, be made for the omission, which will be of increasing importance in the later years, of provision for indirect consequences, such as, e.g., increased expenditure on main-tenance and training of the fleet. It has not been found possible to determine even approximately the amount of such expenditure.(Signed) ERNLE CHATFIELD,Chief of the Naval Staff.

Explanatory Notes on Appendix 1 Building Programme.(A) Capital Ships. ,In paragraph 14 of Annex III to N.C. (M) (35) 50, Report by the British Representatives on the Anglo-Gerrnan Naval Discussions, it was stated : &quot; Dx,these circumstances, it may be essential for the Naval Staff to recommend a more rapid replacement of the British battlefleet in order to ensure that in new ships the British Fleet does not fall behind the capital ship strength of Japan and Germany combined.&quot;2. The more detailed information of the German building programme that has been communicated to us since the date of that report enables the position to be reviewed in greater detail, taking into consideration also the French and Japanese naval building programmes as far as they are known.German Capital Ship Building Programme.3. The German capital ship building programme, which it is intended to complete by the end of 1942, comprises five new capital ships. To enable the fifth ship to be constructed the Germans calculate on transferring tonnage into the capital ship category or on &quot; adjusting &quot; the category tonnage.4. Capital Ships &quot; D &quot; and &quot; E &quot; of 26,000 tons with 11-inch guns (Ships &quot;A,&quot; &quot;B&quot; and &quot; C &quot; are Deutschlands) are expected to complete by the end of 1938; Ship &quot; F &quot; of 35,000 tons with 14-inch or 15-inch guns will be laid down on the 1st July, 1936, and should.complete in 1940; Ship &quot; G,&quot; which will be of 35,000 tons if France builds a second 35,000-ton ship, is expected to complete in 1941; Ship &quot; H &quot; of the maximum qualitative limit that may be agreed upon is expected to complete in 1942.Japanese Building Programme.5. The Japanese building programme is not known, but for the purpose of this paper it is assumed to be not less than that indicated by Admiral Yamamoto as his personal programme, viz., 4 ships to be laid down in the six years 1937-1942, of which 2 ships might be completed by the end of 1942.French Building Programme.6. France is building 2 Battle Cruisers of the Dunkerque class, laid down in 1932 and 1934 respectively (26,500 tons each with 8-13-inch guns and high speed); she intends to lay down a new ship of the France class of 35,000 tons, with 15-inch guns, towards the end of 1935, and to lay down a second ship of this class on or after the 1st January, 1937. Further programmes are unknown and probably undecided.Italian Building Programme.7. Italy is building 2 ships of 35,000 tons and 15-inch guns, which were laid down in 1934.  ,Summary of New Ships.8. Thus, at the end of 1942 we may be faced with a German Capital Ship force of 5 new ships (not including the Deutschlands). During the same period, Japan may have completed at least 2 new capital ships, France 4 or more, and Italy 2.Modernisation.9. Japan is modernising all her capital ships, and it is anticipated that all 9 ships will have been modernised before the end of 1937.10. France is modernising the 3 ships of the Bretagne class which were completed in 1915 and 1916. The 3 ships of the Jean Bart class (completed 1913 and 1914) were extensively refitted in 1929, though it is not considered that they can be regarded as &quot;modernised&quot; ships. The Diderot class (completed in 1911) have not been modernised and are considered to be of small fighting value. It is possible that they may be scrapped on completion of the new ships, and they have not been included in the comparison of numbers.
11. Italy is modernising her 2 ships of the Giulio Cesare class and greatly increasing their speed.12. Of the British Fleet, Nelson, Rodney and Hood are post-war ships that do not require modernisation. Warspite, Queen Elizabeth and Renown will be completely modernised. Bar ham, Malaya, Royal Oak, and Repulse have been or are now in:hand for partial modernisation, but they will not be re-engined, nor will they have improvements to main armament mountings or such increased A/A armaments and aircraft. They cannot be counted as &quot; modernised &quot; ships. The remaining 4 ships of the Royal Oak class and Valiant axe not being modernised at all.13. It is desired to emphasise once again that &quot;modernisation&quot; is not a substitute for a proper replacement programme. As was pointed out in the Appendix to N.C. (M) (35) 1, whatever rate of replacement (within practical limits) is adopted, the extreme age to which some of our ships will necessarily have to last must give cause for the greatest anxiety. The present modernisation programme is designed to make the older ships reasonably able to carry out their functions for the period that they must remain in service; it does not make them comparable to new ships.   This especially applies to the partly modernised ships.14. The minimum situation as regards numbers of capital ships with which we may be faced at the end of 1942 is shown below, together with the British position that will result from the adoption of the different replacement programmes indicated : 	New Ships.

The figures for Japan in this table are based on the assumption that Japan scraps a ship for each new ship completed. Should Japan retain her old ships on completion of the new ones her total would be 11, and by retaining 2 of the older ships (which, however, would not be modernised ships) the British total would be 17.. It is worth noting that 35 per cent, of the tonnage represented by these 17 ships would not give Germany sufficient tonnage to build more than the 5 ships already allowed for. If, however, the British number was increased to 18, Germany would have a reasonable claim to build a sixth ship.16. It will be seen that the British total of 15 ships is approximately equal to the total of Germany and Japan, if we count the 3 Deutschlands as only equal to one ship, but there are 7 new ships in the German-Japanese total, and 7 modernised Japanese ships as well. A British building programme of 2 ships a year (Table C of Enclosure No. 3 to Appendix to N.C. (M) (35) 1) would produce only 6 new ships by the end of 1942, and a programme of 3 ships in 2 years only 5, even if the ships laid down in 1939 were started sufficiently early to ensure their completion within the year 1942. Both of these programmes are inadequate in. the face of the German and Japanese programme, which, as stated above, will realise 7 new ships at this date.17. A building programme of 7 ships in 3 years, to provide equality in new ships only with Germany and Japan, is, therefore, the least that gives reasonable security, and then only if the 1939 ships are laid down sufficiently early to be completed within the year 1942.   Moreover, the first 2 ships should be laid down
aat the earliest possible moment, i.e., January 1937. If Japan starts building at a greater rate than has been assumed in this paper the rate of building would require further acceleration.(B) Aircraft Carriers.Hitherto our building programme for aircraft carriers has been aimed at providing five large aircraft carriers which would accommodate approximately 360 aircraft.In order to spread the replacement, the rate of construction hitherto proposed has been one ship every three years. Under this rate of construction Courageous and Glorious would not have been scrapped until they reached the age of thirty and thirty-three years, respectively, counting from the time of their first completion as cruisers. There is grave doubt whether ships which have to do so much steaming could be made to last for such periods, but the matter has hitherto been governed by the fact that the scrapping age of aircraft carriers, as laid down in the Washington Treaty, twenty years, has been held to apply as from the date of completion as aircraft carriers, under which rule they could not be replaced earlier. It was the intention to raise the question of special allowance being made for these ships in any treaty to replace the Washington Treaty. As there is now no probability of quantitative limitation of aircraft carriers preventing the replacement of these ships when desired, more rapid replacement is obviously desirable.2. Both Commanders-in-Chief of the large fleets have pressed for carriers containing smaller numbers of aircraft, so that they may be separately and more widely disposed. The Admiralty concur in this view, and it is accordingly now proposed to aim at a force of three large carriers accommodating seventy-two aircraft each and four small carriers accommodating thirty-six aircraft each, giving the same total aircraft accommodation as in the previous policy of five large aircraft carriers.3. The proposals in the present paper allow for the laying down of 4 carriers within the period 1936-1942, of which one will be a large one and 3 small.By the end of 1942 replacement vessels will have been completed for all existing carriers except Courageous and Glorious. Courageous will be replaced about 1944 by the last of the 4 carriers mentioned, which it is only proposed to lay down in 1941, and she will then be 27 years old from the date of her original completion as a cruiser. Glorious, of the same age, will remain to be replaced at a later date.(C) Cruisers.1. Nobody can foretell at the present moment what will be the cruiser problem that we shall have to face during the next decade. If there is no agree-ment on total tonnage or on qualitative limitations, any size of cruisers may be built, and we shall be forced to make an adequate reply. The calculations of the cost of Cruiser building in the programme of new construction is based on the assumption that the new cruisers to be built are mainly of the 10,000-ton 6-inch gun type.   It must therefore be regarded as a minimum.2. It is necessary in the first place to consider by what date we should aim at bringing the British Commonwealth Cruiser strength up to the minimum requirement of 60 Under-age Ships in a total of 70 ships. It would be desirable, if it were practicable, that this position should be reached in 1942, since Germany has announced her intention of completing her 35 per cent, quota by that year, and all of it will be under-age. In relation to the Far Eastern situation, an earlier date would be suggested, but, as will be seen from paragraph 4, the question is determined by what is practicable rather than by what is strategically desirable. 1942 is therefore a convenient date on which to base the present review. The state of the Commonwealth cruiser force at the end of that year that would result from various building programmes is set out in the attached table.3. It will be seen that in the table 44 R.N. cruisers are shown in full commission. The number of R.N. cruisers at present maintained in full commis-sion is 30, but in the view of the Naval Staff an increase in this number is
necessary for the following reasons: The present tension in the Mediterranean has exposed markedly our weakness in cruisers in commission. In order to equal even the Italian cruiser strength in the Mediterranean it has been necessary to reinforce the cruisers of the Home and Mediterranean Fleets by withdrawing those stationed all over the world for the protection of our trade. The war training of the Flome Fleet is handicapped by having only one cruiser squadron in that fleet, and squadrons abroad are handicapped by the absence of ships returning home for refits and recommissioning. In addition, it is undesirable to have too large a percentage of cruisers in reserve, or to put into reserve comparatively new ships. It is intended, therefore, to add a second squadron to the Home Fleet and to increase the Home and Mediterranean Fleet cruiser squadrons from 4 to 5 ships each. The normal number of ships in a fleet cruiser squadron has in the past always been five, and was only reduced in 1930-31 as an economy measure. The increase of 14 ships in commission would therefore be distributed as follows : 4. It is not considered that the position resulting from a 3-ship-a-year programme, which would still leave us with 23 overage cruisers in our total in 1942, is one that can be accepted. On the other hand, if we are to complete the whole of our requirement of 60 underage cruisers by that date, it will be seen that 24 ships (plus 1 R.A.N.) would have to be included in the four programme years 1936-39. So rapid an increase would entail a large number of compara-tively modern ships being placed in reserve, and no further building could take place between 1939 and 1945, when ships would be laid down to replace the Kent Class which become overage in 1948. It is considered that a steady building programme of 5 ships a year offers a suitable compromise, and is recommended for adoption. If the 5-ship-a-year programme is adopted up to 1939 4 ships can be included in the 1940-44 programme period.New Home Fleet Squadron ... Additional ship to 1st, 2nd, 3rd OS.

(D) Destroyers.		The Admiralty policy for replacement of destroyers since the war has been largely influenced by the desirability of having a steady replacement programme, and for this reason only one flotilla a year has been built up to 1935, in spite of the fact that all the destroyers being replaced were completed in the war years, and so come overage about the same time.			2.   In Admiralty Paper No. 1, prepared for the 1935 Naval Conference, it was proposed that we should accept a limit of 150,000 tons (12 flotillas) of destroyers, and that if submarine tonnage was not reduced we should retain a further 50,000 tons (4 flotillas) of &quot; overage &quot; vessels.   This proposal was put forward when it was hoped to obtain a tonnage limitation in each category and by keeping a portion of our destroyer tonnage permanently overage we should thus limit the underage destroyer tonnage of other Powers to an agreed ratio of underage  tonnage,   whilst  still  retaining   additional  vessels  ourselves  for Anti-Submarine duties.

It seems most unlikely now that any limitation by total tonnage in various categories will be agreed to in any conference in the near future, or that submarine tonnage will be reduced, and it is therefore necessary to review the proportion between &quot; underage &quot; and &quot; overage &quot; tonnage.4. The first four post-war flotillas become overage 1946-49, and hence till that date, if we are to retain 4 overage flotillas, these flotillas will have to consist of war-built &quot;V&quot; and &quot; W &quot; classes, completed in 1917-19; some of these ships, therefore, will not be scrapped till they are 30 years old.5. On completion of the 1936 programme, there will be 11 underage flotillas complete and only one more flotilla would be required to be built to complete the 12 underage flotillas until replacement for the &quot; A &quot; class is required in the 1944 programme.6. To spread out destroyer building and to reduce the time the older &quot;V&quot; class will have to be retained, it is necessary that the proportion of underage to overage tonnage should be temporarily increased, and a flotilla is accordingly included in each of the 1938, 1940 and 1942 programmes.This will result in the following position : Underage. Overage. Flotillas.      Flotillas.

Notes on Figures contained in Appendix No. 2, with Special Reference to Differences between these Figures and those contained in Table B of Paper D.R.C. 14.It will be seen that it is not found possible to compress into three years the whole of the deficiencies remaining to be provided.As compared with a provision for &quot; deficiencies &quot; in the 1935 Navy Estimates of  2,836,500, the amounts proposed for the succeeding three years are as follows :  1936       ...............        7,049,2001937       ...............        9,237,0001938       ...............        7,821,600Total   .........       ...      24,107,800leaving  4,754,900 to be met subsequently, of which  2,434,000 would fall in 1839.In the following paragraphs the main grounds of divergence between the total for deficiencies under the several headings in the present statement and in that which was before His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1934 vide Table B of OLD. paper D.R.C. 14 are explained in general terms.The total cost of all items, excluding Naval Personnel and the Fleet Air Arm, was given in 1934 as  21,343,000. to which should be added  594,000 (the balance of the programme to 1950 under Item 9 (Mines)), making a total of  21,937,000, as compared with the present revised total of  33,486,900. On the other hand, the provision made in 1934 and 1935 Estimates towards meeting this total was only  4,624,200, as compared with proposed provision under D.R.C. 14 of  6,599,100, so that the prospective deficiency as from the 1st April, 1936, is actually increased by as much as  13^ million, the total being nearly  29 million. This can, however, be considered as partly reduced by the amount that will have to be found additional in 1935 for certain of the items concerned for emergency expenditure, which has the effect of reducing the deficiency. The total of such expenditure approved to date is  830,000.The factors accounting for the increase of approximately  12 million in the total of deficiencies fall under three main heads (the dividing line is, however, frequently obscure) : (1) Compression of expenditure within fewer years ( 150,000). It is important to emphasise that nothing has been included for the inevitable expansion at the Admiralty and outports in the matter of staff to cope with the large volume of extra work involved.(2) Effects of the passage of time (e.g., variation in prices, modern improve-ments) and of under-estimate of deficiencies in 1934 ( 900,000).(3) Change of policy or in the definition of &quot;deficiencies,&quot; including the addition of a Boys&apos; Training Establishment ( 575,000) and further facilities for manufacture and storage of armament supplies ( 2,250,000).The main changes are as follows : Item No. 2. Modernisation of Capital Ships. D.R.C. 14. Appendix No. 2. Difference. 1,861,000  6,406,000 +  4,545,000Subsequent to the production of the above-mentioned figure in D.R.C. 14, information received as to the extent of modernisation of these ships by other Powers shewed that very considerable extra work was necessary on our own ships, if they were to be comparable to those of the Powers concerned.The matter was brought to the notice of the Disarmament Conference Ministerial Committee in paper D.C. (M.) (32) 125, but money was asked for to carry out full modernisation of only 4 capital ships (Warspite, Renown, Queen Elizabeth, Valiant). The work involved consisted principally of re-engining and re-boilering, increasing the elevation of turret guns, addition, &amp;c, to A.A. armament and new equipment of 15-inch shell. These proposals led to a very considerable increase on the figures given in D.R.C. 14.
Owing to the increased building programme now required (see Appendix No. 1), it has been possible to remove Valiant for the present from the list of ships to be fully modernised, so that the total is reduced by the  2,000,000 approximately that would have been required to modernise that ship.Item No. 4. -Anti-Submarine Equipment of Auxiliary Vessels.D.R.C. 14. Appendix No. 2. Difference. 250,000  362,500 -I-  112,500The figures in D.R.C. 14 provided for an increased provision of asdic and depth charge sets to equip auxiliary vessels that would be taken up on the outbreak of war.The present emergency, in which a possible war in the narrow waters of the Mediterranean is visualised, has emphasised the need for increased provision of anti-submarine apparatus. In particular, provision is now made in Appendix No. 2 for fitting A/S equipment to 40 old destroyers and to provide reserves of harbour defence A/S sets and reserves of quartz from which A/S oscillators are constructed and which can only be obtained from sources outside the British Empire.Item No. 5. Local Seaward Defences.D.R.C. 14. Appendix No. 2. Difference. 1,075,000  1,436,400 . -i-  361,400The programme of expenditure in D.R.C. 14 covered the provision of local seaward defences, particularly against submarine activities, at ports at Home and Abroad, excluding Indian and Dominion ports and certain bases of relatively minor importance, such as Bermuda and Kingston (Jamaica).Provision is now made for further boom defences at Singapore in view of the development of new types of fast motor boat. At Hong Kong provision is also now made for booms and other forms of local seaward defences which are not permitted so long as Article XIX of the Washington Treaty is in force. This item is inserted in view of the possibility that the Washington Treaty will lapse after the 31st December, 1936. The present lay-out of local seaward defences at Hong Kong is admittedly quite inadequate.Item No. 6. Fleet Fuelling Reserves.D.R.C. 14.       Appendix No. 2.      Difference.     (a) Storage       ...     2,476,000 2,655,000 -f 179,000(6) Fuel ...     4,180,000 3,410,000 -770,000Total     ...     6,656,000 6,065,000 -591,000The amount of oil to be provided remains the same as in D.R.C. 14. The increase in the cost of storage is mainly due to compression of the period allowed for construction of tanks into three years. The large reduction in the cost of oil is mainly due to a revision of the policy as to where it is to be stored, resulting in a greater proportion being stored abroad instead of in the United Kingdom, with a consequent large reduction of freightage charges.Item No. 7. Ammunition for the Fleet.D.R.C. 14. Appendix No. 2. Difference. 681,000  1,756,900 -h  1,075,900The main provision under this head in D.R.C. 14 was for ammunition for the new type of anti-aircraft pompom which is being mounted in the larger ships of the fleet and which is a weapon of great importance for resisting attack by torpedo-carrying aircraft and diving bombers.The increase now proposed is again due almost entirely to increased provision for anti-aircraft ammunition, but it is now for all types of anti-aircraft guns, for which a much larger amount of ammunition than that hitherto provided is considered essential, in view of developments of modern aircraft and the rapidity of fire of the modern anti-aircraft gun.
Total ...      992,000 3,381,400 4- 2,489,400The considerable increase in this item is due to the inclusion of new depots not included in the tables in D.R.C. 14, the main items being for a new mainItem. No. 8. Torpedoes to complete reserves. D.R.C.14. Appendix No. 2. Difference. 563,000  865,200 -t-  302,200The deficiency in connection with torpedoes originally arose from the fact that as a measure of economy the reserve of torpedoes provided for various classes of ships was, in 1925, reduced from 100 per cent, to 66f per cent. The deficiency figures in D.R.C. 14 represented generally the cost of providing the extra 33^ per cent, of reserves for destroyers and submarines. It was not possible at the time D.R.C. 14 was drawn up to make satisfactory proposals for completing the deficiency because of the lack of factory capacity. The deficiency has been increased since the figures in D.R.C.14 were prepared owing to the completion of new ships for which only 66f per cent, reserves have been provided. It is considered that the full completion of these important deficiencies should now be undertaken and the recent decision to establish a new torpedo factory enables this to be done.Item No. 9. Provision of Mines for Far East and Replacement of H.2 Mines.D.R.C.14. Appendix No. 2. Difference. 646,000  1,240,000 4-  594,000The figures for mines in D.R.C. 14 allowed only for the money to be spent up to 1942 and it was stated in that paper that the programme extended till 1950. The total programme and its cost at that time was the same as that shewn in Appendix No. 2, where it is now included in full, so that the increase of  594,000 is an apparent and not a real one. As the provision of these mines is largely a matter of replacement rather than a new requirement, provision on a programme extending till 1950 is being continued.Item No. 10. Stores and Equipment for Auxiliary Services.D.R.C.14. Appendix No. 2. Difference. 1,652,000  1,695,500 4-    43,500The small increase on this item is due to an increased estimate of the cost of providing a reserve of paravane (anti-mine) equipment to be used by merchant vessels in the event of war.Item No. 11. Naval Stores for Miscellaneous Services.D.R.C. 14. Appendix No. 2. Difference. 1,900,000  1,900,000 No change.While there is no change in the total, provision is now made to make good this deficiency in the three programme years 1936-38.Item No. 12.

armament depot and other necessary magazines ( 2,250,000). The existing congestion in storage for explosives was referred to in D.R.C. 14, and for reasons of safety and to allow for storage of the increased provision of ammunition now being made it is necessary to construct these new magazines. It is hoped that it will be possible for the site of this new depot to be in a &quot; depressed area.&quot; It is not possible to complete these magazines within the years 1936-38 and a large proportion of the sum will remain to be spent in later years. The mine depot in the Mediterranean, referred to in D.R.C. 14 (which the present emer-gency has shown to be an important requirement), is included in these figures,  440,000, but the whole of this sum is included in expenditure subsequent to 1938.The figures in D.R.C. 14 did not allow for provision for machinery at the various depots and this is now included at a cost of some  500,000.Item No. 14.

The two existing Boys&apos; Training Establishments are quite inadequate to allow the increase of personnel now required (Appendix No. 3) to be made, both establishments being already full to capacity. The training period cannot be shortened, and it is consequently urgently necessary to provide a new training establishment. 410,500 is for the widening of No. 10 dock at Plymouth, to enable it to take large capital ships and for the provision of a spare entrance caisson for that dock. There is at present no dock at Plymouth which will take a large capital ship. 30,000 is for the expansion of the Anti-Submarine base at Portland to enable it to fulfil its duties in connection with the increased requirements of anti-submarine material, personnel and training. 400,000 is also included for the widening of the large dock at Gibraltar to take any capital ship (except Hood). Experience in the present emergency has shown that this is a matter of great importance.Rangefinder Test House       ............... 16,000Completion of Boat House    ......       ...      ...... 33,000Dynamic Balancing Machine (completion) ...      ...       ... 3,500Electric  Power   and  Lighting   Installation  for.  above(completion)         ...      ...      ...       ...       ...      ... 5,500Provision of a Wharf in North Wall Gap to accommodatedestroyers and small craft       ...       ...       ...      ... 90,000Dredging for above    ...      ...      ...       ...       ...       ... 32,000Provision of a 30 ft. deep channel, 650 ft. wide, betweenfloating dock and North Wall Gap      ...       ...... 20,000Spare Caisson for Dock       ...      ...       ...      ...       ... 65,000Motor Transport, &amp;c.......      ............ 10,000Fuelling facilities afloat       ...      ...       ...       ...... 50,000Accommodation on shore for ships&apos; crews   ...       ...       ... 138,000Combined Surgery and Sick Quarters        ...      ...      ... 25,900Hospital for Asiatics......      ...       ......... 22,400Signal Tower.........      ............ 23,500Gunmounting Bay      ...      ...      ...       ...      ...      ... 52,000Heavy Crane Tracks on Gunstorage Ground        ...... 53,000Recreational Facilities         ...      ...       ...       ...      ... 31,500Dockside Crane and Standard Gauge Travelling Crane  ... 30,000

The total number of new first line aircraft is 314, an increase of 37 over the figures given in D.E.C. 30, paragraph 36. This 37 is accounted for by a slight increase in the carrying capacity of the carrier programme contained in Appendix 1 and by the fact that the cruiser programme is slightly increased and extended beyond the original programme date.2. The total capital cost of aircraft for carriers and for modernising H.M. ships is  3,541,000. There is a further capital cost of aircraft for new construction ships. amounting to  2,594,700, but this is included in the cost of the ships themselves.3. There will also be a possible addition of about  570,000 for 60 aircraft as alternative equipment for certain cruisers.   This will materialise between 1939 and 1941.4. It is1 further possible that one existing carrier might be retained as a training carrier; if so she will keep her aircraft, and to that extent there will be an increase in the capital cost of new aircraft in the year when she would have been scrapped and an increase in the annual maintenance cost of the FA.A. thereafter.APPENDIX No. 5 TO SCHEDULE I.Possible Base in Cyprus.The present emergency has shown that until experience has proved what the threat from the air really amounts to and whether it can be effectively countered by anti-aircraft defences, we must remain uncertain of being able to make full use of our main base in the Mediterranean (Malta) in a war against France or Italy. The present situation of our fleet in Eastern Mediterranean ports with no docking facilities whatever is one that can only be contemplated with serious anxiety.An investigation has accordingly been carried out as to the possibility of providing base facilities elsewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean. In view of the status of Egypt and Palestine, Cyprus is considered the most satisfactory site for such a base, and a tentative estimate for establishing a base at Famagusta in that island is given in the table attached to this Appendix.It is not - for several reasons suggested that Malta (where we have sunk millions of money) should be abandoned as a naval base. Firstly, the doubt as to its availability only arises in connection with a war with Italy or France, and it would be of great value in any other conflict. Even in a war with France the question would not be of such great importance as in the case of Italy, because such a war would be mainly fought in the Atlantic, and not in the Mediterranean.APPENDIX No. 4 TO SCHEDULE 1.
Secondly, to abandon Malta as a Naval Base would lead to a most difficult situation in connection with the Maltese population, which has increased largely during the century and half we have occupied the island and which is to-day largely dependent on the Navy and garrison for its livelihood.Again, such abandonment would inevitably lead to great growth of the present pro-Italian feelings and it might even raise the question of the cession of the Island to Italy, which i could not be contemplated from the strategical point of view. !While the above reasons for retaining our base at Malta are considered decisive, we may well be faced in the ensuing years with a hostile Italy ready to threaten our position in the Mediterranean if ever we are engaged elsewhere. This being so, it is considered that it will probably be very desirable that we shall possess some facilities in the Eastern Mediterranean for the repair and maintenance of our fleet in addition to those at Malta.The investigation represented by the attached table made provision for a full-scale base with a view to investigating the question. It is unlikely, however, that such extensive facilities would be required, at any rate in the first instance, but it may well prove advisable to undertake the first essentials of the scheme, such as the construction of the breakwater and one dock, together with the provision of sufficient facilities to enable a large ship damaged below water to be repaired.While this question is brought to the notice of the Committee, ho actual proposals for expenditure are made at this stage.Table Attached to Appendix No. 5.The figures in paragraph 2 below show very approximately the cost of establishing a Fleet Base at Famagusta, which would include : (i) Anchorage space for 8 capital ships, 4 aircraft carriers, 15 cruisers,54 destroyers, and the necessary small craft and auxiliaries, (ii) Alongside berths for a proportion of the above.(iii) 2 capital ship docks, 2 cruiser docks and 2 smaller docks.(iv) Mine and Armament Depot, (v) Torpedo Depot and Range.:   (yi) F.A.A. Base, (vii) Hospital and Barracks, (viii) W/T Stations, (ix) Oil fuel storage for 300,000 tons.(x) Breakwater and reclamation work as necessary to enclose the above.2.

Copy No.    8 schedule II TO D.R.C. 37Suggested Programme for Meeting the Deficiencies now existing in the Defence ServicesNote by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on Army requirements in accordance with Conclusion (ii) at the 14th Meeting of the Defence Requirements Sub-Committee, and the conclusions reached at the 4th Meeting of the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee (D.R.C. 27), I have had a compre-hensive revision made of the estimates of Army requirements shown in the tables attached to D.R.C. 24. In revising the figures, account has been taken of the latest decisions regarding the reorganization and mechanization of the Army, of the possibilities-ities of stimulating the manufacture of warlike stores both in normal times and after the outbreak of war, and of probable wastage of material and expenditure of ammu-nition in a future European war under modern conditions.2. It will be seen that as a result considerable adjustments, and in most cases increases, have had to be made to the original approximate estimates included in D.R.C. 14 and D.R.C. 24. The reasons for these alterations are explained in detail below.3. In addition, further tables are now attached covering the following items which were not formerly included in the Defence Requirements programme : (1) Erection of new factories for ammunition components and filling, and provision of jigs, tools, etc., for industrial mobilization in order to increase our &quot;war potential.&quot;   (Appendix II.)(2) An increase in the number of Infantry Battalions in the British Army. (Appendix III.)(3) Replacement of out of date barracks and provision of new barracks. (Appendix IV.)4. The first of these three must, I suggest, be considered as directly connected with our defence arrangements. The second has a very direct bearing both on the efficiency of our defence arrangements abroad and on the training of the Army at home ; whilst the third, as has been pointed out in Army Estimates speeches on several occasions, not only influences recruiting of the Army at home which, as the Committee are aware, is at present one of the major difficulties we have to face in the preparation of the Army for war, but is a matter which in any case must be attended to in the near future as many of the existing barracks and huts provide accommodation considerably below the accepted standard in civil life, and involve very large expense in upkeep.The additional tables have therefore been attached in order that the Committee may have before it as complete a picture as possible of the total ultimate needs of the Army both at home and abroad.5. As is explained below, estimates both for warlike stores and for military works are dependent on a variety of factors which cannot be assessed Avith complete accuracy. The length of the programme adopted, the demands on firms for civil requirements and similar factors are all liable to cause considerable variations. It is believed, however, that the figures shown in the attached tables may be accepted as a good working basis for assessing the needs of the Army in relation to war in the comparatively near future.Appendix L (A) Regular Contingent.6. (a) Personnel. This annual recurrent expenditure rising from  180,000 next year to between IT million and one and a half million pounds, according to the final decision regarding the rate of mobilization, is necessary in order to provide a sufficient army reserve for existing units and to create certain additional units at present entirely lacking, such as coast defence units, anti-aircraft units and army tank battalions. At the present time most of the arms and services have insufficient reserve personnel to complete them to establishment on&quot; the outbreak of war and to(9061) a
replace wastage in the interval before post-war recruits can be trained. The shortages in personnel and the problem of stimulating recruiting is dealt with in more detail in Appendix VII,Possible additional infantry battalions are not included in the above estimate of expenditure which might have to be further increased if additional financial attractions have to be offered to obtain sufficient recruits.7. (b) Material. It will be observed that the figure shown in the original D.R.C. report of  14,820,000 (exclusive of ammunition required for the first contingent during the first three months of war) has now risen to 25 million, approximately, exclusive of works services (for additional storage capacity, garages, etc).The reasons for this increa.se briefly are : (a) More detailed calculations are now available as to probable rates of wastage ofmaterial in a European war under modern conditions, and in most cases it has been necessary to increase the original figures allowed for reserves.(b) The capacity of industry after the outbreak of war can now be assessed moreaccurately, and in many cases it seems certain that reserves to meet wastage during the initial stages of war must be greater than was at first anticipated.(c) Formation of a mechanized mobile division instead of a horsed CaA^alryDivision and the addition of Army Tank Battalions (for the support of Infantry) have since been allowed for.The cost of providing on a fully mechanized basis a new Field Artillery equipment to replace the present 18-pr. gun and 4&apos;5-inch howitzer which must be regarded as obsolescent, is not included in the above figure of  25 millions.Appendix VI, however, contains notes by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Master General of the Ordnance dealing with this subject, and the probable ultimate cost is included, in Appendix VII, in the Grand Total of capital sums required.8. In addition, an estimate has been added for storage and garage accommodation which will b&apos;e required fcoth for wrar equipment and reserves.I. should here make it clear that in estimating requirements of both equipment and ammunition reserves, it has been necessary to make a large number of assumptions with regard to the time taken to produce each individual article of equipment, and these assumptions naturally affect the quantity of equipment of each class that has to be held in peace time.   The same factors apply to ammunition reserves.Over and above these detailed assumptions, I should stress the fact that all estimates for material and ammunition are based on the hypothesis that war will occur when the programme for completing Army deficiencies has just been completed, i.e., when industry has got well into its stride in the matter of providing war-like stores and can therefore be expected to expand rapidty to meet war conditions. Should this not be the case, the various branches of industry which have been dealing with the re-equipment of the Army would naturally in the course of a few years lose a pro-portion of their &quot; war potential &quot; and the quantities of reserves, both of equipment and ammunition, would proportionally have to be increased.9. (c) Ammunition reserves. The original estimate of  10,860,000 in the D.R.C. report under this heading has now risen to  35,276,000 (including  743,000 already passed) plus about one and a half million for works services.The new figure is based on a more accurate appreciation of the capacity of industry to meet war expenditure of ammunition, and it should be emphasized that the figure is absolutely conditional on some  14 millions being spent as a preparatory measure on the erection of certain new factories and on preparations for industrial mobilization. If nothing was done to stimulate industry, the cost of war reserves and ammunition which it would be necessary to hold in peace time would probably be at least doubled, and, of course, it would be impossible to build up this reserve of ammunition in five, or even perhaps, ten years, under present conditions of manufacture.10. (d) Erection of new factories for ammunition components and filling and provision of jigs, tools, etc., for industrial mobilization in order to increase our &quot; war potential.&quot; The object of this expenditure,  15,805,000, is explained above. Details of the factories, etc., for which this money is required are given in Appendix II.The figure covers the proposals for the removal of two of the Royal Ordnance Factories from Woolwich to sites less subject to air attack as given in C.I.D. paper. 208 A dated March, 1935, and also provides for additional capacity.
It is unnecessary here to stress the fact that in a European war it would be folly to rely on producing a large proportion of our guns and ammunition, in the present Arsenal.(jS) Territorial Army.11. In paragraph 85 of D.R.C. 14 it was mentioned that a Regular Field Force consisting of 4 divisions, a Cavalry Division, 2 Air Defence Brigades and a Tank Brigade with a Royal Air Force contingent of appropriate numbers together with the necessary complement of G.H.Q. Corps and L. of C. troops, constituted the approximate minimum which can be despatched to the Continent with any hope of operating effectively in conjunction with Allies. I am still of this opinion, although I should like to add that I consider it essential that this force should be provided with all its essential needs in establishments and reserves and as regards modern armament and equipment, e.g., tanks, anti-tank weapons, armoured machine gun carriers, etc.12. In paragraph 86 of D.R.C. 14, it was mentioned that in 1914 we were in grave danger of defeat, firstly because of the shortage of artillery ammunition and secondly because no adequate provision had been made in peace for a properly organized force to augment the Regular Expeditionary Force within a reasonable period.13. The question of artillery ammunition has been dealt with above. As regards augmenting the Regular Field Force with further contingents, I have now reached the conclusion that we cannot envisage leaving the small Regular Field Force unsupported for more than a period of 4 months, and that we must aim at placing the following contingents of the Territorial Army in the field fully equipped on a modern scale as follows : 4 Divisions at 4 months. 4 Divisions at 6 months. 4 Divisions at 8 months.14. After allowing for the conversion of two Territorial Army Divisions in order to create additional units for the air defence requirements of Great Britain, there are 12 Divisions remaining for the above purpose.15. The Territorial Army is in an even less satisfactory state as regards personnel than the Regular Army and as indicated in Appendix VII energetic measures to-stimulate recruiting must be taken if the Territorial Army is to be in a condition to undertake its air defence and home defence duties in addition to supplying contingents to reinforce our small Regular Army after the outbreak of war.As regards material both mobilization equipment and war reserves for the Territorial divisions are virtually non-existent, whilst for training they have to rely largely on out of date equipment which is not regarded as good enough for the Regular Force.16. It is, therefore, in my opinion essential that steps should be taken to provide adequate training equipment, mobilization equipment and war reserves for the above contingents of the Territorial Army to allow them to take the field at the periods shown above and to create a &quot; war potential &quot; to complete equipment and to maintain these forces in the field. Whilst reliance can be placed on post war production for producing many of the cheaper and more simple warlike stores, complicated articles such as tanks, guns, small arms, etc., the manufacture of which is at present limited to very few firms, take 6 months or more to produce.It is, therefore, necessary to provide at home in peace time a considerable proportion of the latter, and it is on this basis that the figures shown in Table (B) (a) have been produced.17. In the original Defence Requirements Report (D.R.C. 14) it was proposed that a sum of  250,000 per annum should be allotted to the Territorial Army to increase its state of training and efficiency. After careful consideration both of the training and personnel aspect, I consider that this sum is still required in addition to the capital sum for material shown in (B) (a) of Appendix I in order to provide cadres for certain missing units, better training facilities, regular instructors, etc.I should add that although the figure in (B) (a) of Appendix I is a startling increase to those previously before the Committee, every possible allowance for the production of equipment after the outbreak of emergency has been made.(u061) A 2
18. The ammunition requirements of the Territorial Army, when they take the field, have been catered for under the heading (A) (a) &quot; Ammunition Reserves &quot;, and in this case also it is clearly necessary to hold considerable reserves for the Territorial Army in time of peace since the production of ammunition, even allowing for all possible stimulation of industry and the preparation of peace time plans, cannot be expected to overtake expenditure in war until about the sixth month.(C) Defended Ports *19. Item (a) (ii). Singapore Stage II. This Item includes two 15-inch guns already approved, three 6-inch batteries, six Defence Electric Lights, and barracks for an additional infantry battalion. The cost will be  949,000 (see Note 12, Appendix I). This will be required as follows if the defences are to be completed as early as possible : 1935-36 ......       .........      77,000^1936-37 ............... 301,000 j1937-38...       ............ 478,000!    These figures1938-39 ...............      93,000 fare approximate.Total ......    949,000 J20. Item (ad) (i). Other Ports east of Suez including Hong Kong. The bulk of the capital sum now required is for Hong Kong, which is increased from  1,200,000 to  1,999,000 as a result of further revision of the rearmament required within the limitations of the Washington Treaty. The lapse of that Treaty would entail further increases, and any deterioration of the political situation in the Far East will require additions to the ammunition reserves at Hong Kong, for which a low interim scale only has been approved.21. At the present rate of provision ( 200,000 a year) this programme will take 15 years to complete. An increase of  100,000 a year (making  300,000) is recom-mended in order that the programme may be completed in 10 years. The more important portion of it would, of course, be finished at a much earlier date. This increase would entail an acceleration of the rise in annual recurrent cost of personnel, vide Notes 16 (c) and (d). It is suggested that provision of Anti-Aircraft ammunition be treated as a separate item (see paragraph 28).22. Item (aa) (ii). Hong Kong barracks for additional infantry. This item is explained in Note 14.The expenditure will not materialize until a battalion is available.23. (b) Mediterranean and Cape Route. This is on a 20-year programme and the present political situation shows that some acceleration, especially in regard to Malta, is desirable. Emergency measures taken in connection with the present crisis will probably enable some acceleration to be made in the approved programme, but some further allotment is clearly desirable. An addition of  50,000 per annum will suffice. This will enable the more important items especially at Malta to be completed within a reasonable period.24. (c) Home Ports. Many of these are not of great importance, but the present allotment is quite insufficient to remedy even urgent requirements. The Naval situation in Home waters has altered considerably since the original Defence Require-ments Committee sat. It is considered that a total of  75,000 per annum should be allotted, i.e., an additional  50,000.25. (d) Personnel. The total eventual cost, as stated in Note 16, amounts to approximately  900,000 per annum. This will be partially offset by the eventual completion of the modernization programme. In the meantime, an additional  100,000 per annum is required for personnel to cover Stage II for Singapore and a part of the increase to R.A. and R.E. establishments at Home. This will eventually rise to  148,000 per annum, vide Notes 16 (b) and (e). The present crisis has shown that the latter increases are urgently required.* Note. In this paper no account is taken of the possible establishment of a new Naval Base at Cyprus.
(D.) Air Defence of Great Britain.26. (a) General Charges, and(&amp;.) Reserve Ammunition.It would be convenient to treat A.A. ammunition as a new and separate item. This would make about  200,000 per annum of the present D.R.C. allotment available for equipment instead of ammunition. This is probably as much as could be economically spent.   It is proposed therefore that : (a) ammunition be dealt with separately, and(b) the whole of the balance of the old allotment (including ammunition) be madeavailable for equipment for A.D.GB. other than ammunition.27. The above will furnish the greatest acceleration economically possible in the next two or three years. At the end of that time it is recommended that the allotment be further considered. A.very early decision is necessary on Stage II and Stage III of the A.D.G.B. programme, but in any case, if the above proposals are agreed, no additional allotment would be required at present.28. A.A. Ammunition. The present proposal is to begin a programme to provide 300,000 rounds a year at a cost of approximately  900,000 per annum. The necessary approval has already been given for a programme of 200,000 rounds a year at a cost of  600,000. The final requirements are still under consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence and will depend on whether or not continuous production is authorized. The total required for all purposes is likely to be more rather than less than the 2 J million rounds at present estimated.Appendix III.29. Additional infantry battalions. As the Committee of Imperial Defence are well aware, the resources of the Regular Army have been strained to the utmost to furnish the. minimum garrisons required overseas since the late war and, as the present emergency in the Mediterranean has shown, the lack of a sufficient reserve there presents serious difficulties in the event of possible trouble in Egypt. In addition, the garrison of Singapore is short of one battalion, whilst already the Cardwell system is impaired to the extent of our having to maintain two of the Home Battalions on short tour in the Mediterranean. The maintenance of two battalions of Guards in Egypt will also not be possible for an indefinite period.30. Fully to meet our foreign commitments, therefore, 6 additional infantry battalions are required abroad with 6 more at home to relieve them. The former are : 2 for Malta.1 for Singapore.2 to replace 2 short tour battalions abroad.1 to replace the 2nd Guards Battalion in Egypt.In the event of the Tientsin Battalion not being withdrawn to Hong Kong, the total addition of battalions to the British Army would be 14.31. In view, however, of the present state of recruiting, the raising of so many new battalions is at present clearly impracticable and for this reason only 4 are shown in Appendix III.   These 4 are, I consider, urgently required.Appendix IV.32. Re-building of Barracks and provision of new Barracks. (Normal Works Services). In addition to the deficiencies which impair the Army&apos;s readiness for war and to the heavy expenditure involved in the proposal to move certain portions of the Royal Arsenal from Woolwich, the Army is confronted with an unusually heavy programme of urgent works requirements of which, unless normal provision in Army Estimates is supplemented, a considerable portion must be dispensed with altogether to the detriment of the serving soldier&apos;s comfort and, no doubt, also of recruiting, whilst the balance would have to be spread over about 25 years. These services, due to a large extent to financial stringency since the war, although abnormal
The War Office,Whitehall, S.W. 1.October, 1935.in number and in cost, are all of a normal character, (i.e., they do not cover the provision of accommodation for additional stores, vehicles, ammunition, etc., works expenditure on which are included in various items in Appendix I), and these should be carried out in the course of the next 10 years. The programme now in view totals  16,000,000 as shown in Appendix IV, to which, of course, must be added numerous minor services arising from day to day.33. To the total of  16,000,000, if the programme is carried out in full, must be added  l&quot;9 million for extra staff but normal estimate provision will no doubt be available to meet part of the cost and it is accordingly calculated that if this particular programme were dealt with by a &quot; works loan &quot; totalling some  12^ millions, it could be cleared off during the period 1936 to 1945. This is on the basis of a normal works loan, repayment of principal and interest falling on army funds. But if this last condition were waived the amount of the loan required would be approxi-mately  10 millions.It will be noted that the construction of barracks for new infantry battalions, if approved, has not been taken into account in this estimate.34. The possibilities of implementing this programme. A separate paper has been prepared (Schedule IV) dealing with the question of the extent to which the present deficiencies of the Army could be remedied by the 3lst March, 1939, on the assumption that finance was not a limiting factor.

For many years now the question of replacing the present field artillery equipment of the Army has been the subject of theoretical study, and practical trials have recently taken place with a view to establishing the most suitable weight of shell for a new universal equipment in the event of the latter&apos;s introduction becoming a practicable proposition.It has for years been admitted that the present field artillery weapons do not meet the require-ments of modern warfare, but the funds provisionally allotted under the existing D..R.C. proposals were insufficient to admit of the inclusion of a re-equipment programme.2. The field artillery of the Army is at present equipped with the 18-pr. field gun and the 4-5-inch howitzer.   These weapons are in general design both over 30 years old.The carriage of neither is intended for mechanized draught, although, by means of rubber pads and other expedients, a certain number have been made capable, to a limited extent, of standing the strain of traction np to a speed of 12 rn.p.h. at the most.The ranges of the 18-pr. gun, and particularly of the 415-inch howitzer, are quite inadequate for modern warfare. For example, the new German field howitzer has, I understand, a maximum range of over 12,000 yards as compared with the 6,600 yards of 4&quot; 5-inch howitzer.If the introduction of a new field artillery equipment for the army were approved, it would be possible to produce a &quot; gun-howitzer &quot; i.e., a weapon which would replace both the 18-pr. and the 4 * 5-inch howitzer an immense advantage from the point of view of ammunition manufacture and supply, as w ell as of tactical handling in the field.The existing 18-pr. piece (3- 3-inch bore) can be bored out and fitted with a loose liner of 3&apos;45-inch bore a suitable calibre for the proposed new weapon. A battery of four guns of this type will shortly be under manufacture, and it is hoped to hold trials next Spring.The weight of the shell will be 25 lb. with a maximum range of 12,000 yards, with good accuracy.3. The existing stocks of 4- 5-inch and 18-pr. ammunition amount to 630,000 rounds and 1-J million rounds, respectively.In the event of an emergency arising before the proposed conversion programme has provided equipment and ammunition for the first contingent, this ammunition would provide for that contingent as follows : Equipment ammunition. Base reserve.Expenditure for 2,-\ months 18-pr. Expenditure for 2 months 4&apos; 5-inch howitzer.During the early conversion period (i.e., during the first two years of the programme) it is hoped that the equipment of the first contingent, and a portion of the ammunition for that contingent will be in stock.
As shown in Schedule IV, it would be impossible, in any case, to provide the ammunition required for the second contingent in less than four years. It is therefore considered that the adoption of a new weapon would not materially jeopardise pur preparedness for war, which, in any case,, cannot be fully achieved in less than five years.At the present moment there are available 1,414 (18-pr.) equipments suitable for conversion.In addition we hold 741 4&quot; 5-inch howitzers and 484 early marks of 18-prs. which would eventually be scrapped after being utilized in an emergency for training purposes.4. The total numbers of converted and new equipments required for mobilization equipment,, and replacing war wastage until post-war manufacture can overtake it, would be (i) For 1st Contingent and including peace equipment for T.A.      ...    738 + 1008 or 1746 (ii) For 2nd, 3rd and 4th Contingents (i.e., mobilization equipment and wastage) ...      936The cost under (i) for conversion, new manufacture and pro-viding two ammunition trailers per equipment would be-Total    ...  2,479,800The cost under (ii), which will entail all new manufacture,would be approximately    .........      ...      .........  2,652,7005. Subject to the trials early next year proving successful, and it being possible to go immediately to production, it is estimated that we should be able to obtain from Vickers and the Royal Ordnance Factories some 500 converted equipments in two years under present conditions. This suffices for equipping the 1st Contingent, without wastage.Two more years would under the improved conditions created by the above probably suffice for the 2nd and 3rd Contingents, and one additional year, under still improving conditions, for the-4th Contingent making a total of 5 years for the complete re-equipment.If, however an extensive programme for the re-equipment of the Army is adopted, and the general -procedure and conditions outlined in Schedule IV are accepted, the total re-equip-ment programme should be shortened considerably and the &quot;danger&quot; period mentioned in paragraph 3, correspondingly reduced.Ammunition6. The 18-pr. and the 4-5-inch howitzer-ammunition as mentioned in paragraph 3, will not be wasted, because as soon as our conversion programme nears completion, some of this ammunition can be used for practice in peace and for training post-war recruits, and the remainder can be converted for manufacture of the new type, the &quot;conversion value&quot; of the remainder being^ about  1,000,000.7. To sum up, the total cost of providing converted and new artillery equipment would be :  (a) For the 1st Contingent     ........................1.216,500(b) For the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Contingents............      ......   3,916,000Total.........      ...............      ...   5,132,500From this must be deducted that portion of the figures included in (A) (b) and (B) (a) of Appendix I, Field Artillery Equipment, viz.:- 1,835,000, leaving a net increase of  3,297,500.The total cost of 25-pr. ammunition which it is considered must be held in peace time for all four contingents will amount to  19,754,272, less  1,000,000 realized in aid from existing stocks (See paragraph 6 above.)From this must be deducted the figure for 18-pr. and 4-5-inch ammunition included in (A) (c\ in Appendix I, viz. :- 13,122,000, leaving a net increase of  5,632,272.The net addition to the D.R.C. programme contained in the above quoted paper for guns and ammunition will therefore be approximately  8,930,000.Note by the Master-General of the Ordnance8. Three factors of the first importance will affect our prospects of realizing the forecasts of the paper: (a) The length in time of the programme.(b) The amount given us in money. -;(c) The productive capacity of firms, taking into consideration the demands of other services9. The last of these three factors troubles me a good deal because we may be certain that demands will be heavy, and we already have probable extensive commitments in anti-tank and anti-aircraft equipments and the question of priority as between the Services is bound to arise.10. The point I wish to make is this, that until our general programme is defined, para. 1 (a) and (&amp;), and the priority question, para. (1) (c), is much clearer, it is impossible to say how long the the period will be when we shall be forcedly in the position of having 3 equipments instead of 2. We have to get worse before we can be better, and we are faced with a very difficult calculation of the date on which we should stop tbe production of 18-pr. and 4&apos;5-inch ammunition and that depends (a) on the rate at which we can build up a reserve of 25-pr. ammunition on which we have aleeway of some 2 million rounds to make up ; and (6) on the rate at which equipments can be converted pari passu.
APPENDIX VII TO SCHEDULE IITHE PERSONNEL SITUATION AND THE PROBLEM OP RECRUITING 1. Personnel are required on mobilization for three r61es (a) To bring units from peace to war establishments.(b) To provide the staff for training units for the production of post-mobilization soldiers.(c) To meet wastage between the time that units go overseas, and post-mobilization soldiers2. Regular Army. War establishments of the first contingent of the Field Force amount to 155,000. Staffs for training units, instructors for the Territorial Army and the many establishments that have to be maintained at home during war-time total 45,000. These liabilities (a) and (b) can just be met by the regular army, its reserve and the supplementary reserve. The total of these will be, it is estimated, in 1939, 204,000. The third (c), a very important one, is estimated at 62,000, to meet which there are now only available 4,000 trained men and 12,000 maturing recruits. This shows a total deficit of 46,000.3. Territorial Army. Assuming that three contingents of four divisions each embark at 4, -6 and 8 months respectively after mobilization, figures corresponding to those of the regular army are : (a) Second Contingent (at 1th month) Requirements War Establishments............      ............... 116,000Training units and cadre for 2nd line units      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 17,000Wastage        ............................... 6,000139,000Available net strength of 4 strongest divisions taking their actual strengthstoday.................................    33,000(b) 3rd and 1th Contingents (at 6th and 8th month). The requirements are approximately thesame as for the earlier contingent, but the corresponding assets are approximately only 31,000 and 24,000 respectively, as the actual strengths of the next eight divisions are considerably lower.(c) For coast defence and air defence the anticipated requirements are 12,000 and 43,000 against which there actually only exist 5,000 and 12,000 respectively.(d) The total deficit in the three T.A. Contingents, A.D.G.B. and Coast Defence is approximately318,000. This does not include any men required for Air raid precautions and the guarding of vulnerable points.Of the total deficit of 318,000, those required to complete the 2nd Contingent (106,000) and those required to complete Coast and Air Defence Units (38,000) (Total 144,000) must be available in peace, whilst the balance, 174,000, must be enlisted immediately at mobilization.There is at present no T.A. reserve.4. The causes of these deficieuces on mobilization are- (a) The &quot; liability &quot; of the large wastage rates that must be accepted for a European war andfor which no long term provision has hitherto been made. (5) The present deficit of recruits to fill peace establishments.It is estimated that in 1939, at the present rate of recruiting, the Regular Army will be over 15,000 short while the Territorial Army is now not only 42,000 short of its peace establishments, but these establishments are much too low at present to make it possible to expand to war requirements within the necessary time.5. To remedy these deficiencies the Army Council are taking steps to encourage recruiting and improve the soldier&apos;s position but it is felt that a national effort must be made to revive recruiting, both in the regular and Territorial Armies. The Peace establishments of Territorial units will obviously have to be raised and units now non-existent will have to be created but until present establishments are filled it is little use attempting to estimate the cost involved.are ready.Deficit106,000

SCHEDULE III TO D.R.C. 37.Royal Aii&apos; Force Requirements.Memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff.1. THE Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements at its 2nd Meeting (the 8th July, 1935) decided to remit to the Defence Requirements Committee the following Terms of Reference : &quot; To re-examine, in the light of the situation set forth in Paper No. D.P.R. 6, and with special reference to financial co-ordination, the programmes of the Navy, Army and Air Force, and to make recommendations for the future.&quot;Paper No. D.P.R. 6 set out the chief changes in the situation since the date (the 28th February, 1934) of the original Report of the Defence Requirements Committee (D.R.C. 14), and pointed out that, in order to place our defences and defence forces on a sound footing, it will be necessary (a) to make good the deficiencies that have accumulated in recent years, and (b) to provide programmes to meet expansion of the forces of Germany and Japan. The Defence Require-ments Committee accordingly (13th Meeting, the 11th July, 1935) asked the Chiefs of Staff to prepare programmes for meeting the existing deficiencies in their respective Services. The present Memorandum relates to the deficiencies in the Air Force. . -2. The recently approved increases for Home Defence still leave notable deficiencies, of which the most important is the inadequate provision for war reserves. Measures are also necessary to strengthen the air forces overseas, and in particular those required to meet the possibility of war with Japan in the Far East.3. The deficiencies reviewed in the present paper include several items covered by the recommendations from the original Report of the Defence Require-ments Committee (D.R.C. 14), but which for financial reasons were excluded from the five-year programme recommended by the Ministerial Committee. The reasons for making good these particular deficiencies have now become more urgent, and the measures necessary for this purpose are included in the new proposals.WAR RESERVES.4. The approved programme of expansion, which is designed to increase our Metropolitan first-line strength to a total of 123 squadrons by April 1937. should be adequate to meet an expansion of German first-line air strength to a total not in excess of 1,500 aircraft, and should also constitute a strong deterrent to aggressive action by Germany or by any other potential enemy in Europe. The possession of first-line strength alone does not, however, of itself ensure security.5. In air warfare, particularly in Europe, the clash will be immediate, intensive and sustained; losses in personnel and material will be heavy; the expenditure of armament stores and fuel supplies will be continuous and on a large scale. Unless this wastage is continually replaced, our air forces will be rapidly reduced in strength, and in a very short time will become impotent either to defend this country against air attack or to undertake offensive operations against the enemy.6.   It is most unlikely that the peace time productive capacity of our industry, however highly organised, will be adequate at the outset of hostilities to meet these requirements, and a period of several months will elapse before full [12270-1] F
war production will be possible. To bridge this gap, it is necessary to maintain in peace sufficient reserves of all kinds to enable our squadrons to sustain their operational effort, under all probable conditions, until new production has reached the required level. This is a matter to which attention is being given by the Principal Supply Officers Sub-Committee, but examination of the problem, as so far carried out, indicates that the war time output of new material could not be equal to war wastage until at least 6 months from the outbreak of war, and then only on the assumption that all practicable measures had been adopted in peace for accelerating output at the earliest moment after the outbreak of war. On that basis it is estimated that an expenditure of approximately  50,000,000 will be required to provide war reserves of aircraft and other equipment sufficient to maintain the Air Force in a Home Defence War up to the time when wastage can be made good by war time production. Details of this amount are shown in Appendix A. The production by the end of 1938-39 of the requisite number of aircraft, &amp;c, is almost certainly beyond the capacity of the firms at present employed by the Air Ministry, and would probably entail bringing in new sources of production. It is in any case certain that special measures will be necessary to increase the factory output of bombs. Further expenditure, provisionally estimated at  8,000,000, will be required on special equipment (jigs, gauges, tools and machinery) and raw material if we are to ensure that there will be no delay in putting into operation the plans for increasing the output of the aircraft industry on the outbreak of war. It may be observed that reserve stocks could be more easily protected against enemy air attacks than would many industrial establishments, and for that reason it would be unwise to rely over much upon the acceleration of war production as compared with the holding of actual reserves. In particular, during the opening phases of a war with a Power within air range of this country,&apos; industrial establishments cannot be assured of undisturbed working conditions.7. The difficulty of making financial provision of this magnitude is obvious, particularly as the Navy and Army also have serious accumulated deficiencies in their war reserves. Nevertheless, in the existing situation, the first-line strength of our air forces will be no more than a deterrent gesture to other Powers, and they will be unable to support any sustained operations. This is a factor of first importance in relation to air warfare, which, once started, affords us no fencing for time or refusal of battle. No considerations of space or topography can be exploited towards postponing a decision and no sheltering behind covering forces can be resorted to whilst the main effort is being prepared, unless an offensive comparable in effect to that achieved by the enemy can be prosecuted and sustained from the outset.8. This factor is recognised in the Interim Report of the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament (CP. 193 (34), July 1934) :  &apos;&apos; Considered from the point of view of the deterrent effect on Germany as a potential aggressor, and from that of public opinion in this country, there is much to be said for the formation of as large a number of squadronsas possible.....On the other hand, there are obvious risks in the plan of: putting all our wares in the shop window &apos; if pressed too far.....Thereserve must be provided before an outbreak of war becomes imminent. ....On balance, we have come to the conclusion that in the present circum-stances we should, in the main, concentrate on an expansion of the Home Defence Force&apos; in the early years. During this first stage we should make some provision for war requirements, the bulk of which, however, will have to be deferred to a later stage unless some changes in the situation necessitates a speeding up. It is true that this will not give us an Air Force capable of sustained warfare within the five-year period contemplated by the Defence Requirements Committee.&quot;9. The allowance in OP. 193 (34) of only  1,200,000 for reserves in the period 1934-38 was based on the assumption that the Royal Air Force was not required to be ready for war before 1942. The Terms of Reference for the present enquiry, however, have advanced this date to the end of the financial year 1938-39. Recent and reliable information, moreover, indicates that German preparations are designed not only to attain a considerable first-line air strength
in the near future, but also to provide their air force with the means of under-taking sustained operations in war. Intensive efforts are being made so to develop the German aircraft industry that it will be capable of immediate expansion to meet war.wastage; an organisation is being set up with the object of creating a large reserve of trained pilots; and there are definite indications that Germany intends, if possible, to accumulate a year&apos;s reserve of aviation spirit.   In paragraph 3 (14) of the new Terms of Reference it is stated &quot; We feel bound to mention, in this connection, that reliable evidence is available that Germany is raising outside the Budget enormous sums by internal borrowing, and that there is no doubt that most of this money is for re-armament.&quot;In these circumstances it appears that the scale and rate of provision of Avar reserves for the Royal Air Force should now be determined. I strongly recommend, therefore, that a programme for the allotment of such funds as can be made available for this purpose during the next few years be approved as soon as possible in order that administrative plans and preparations may be under-taken.Enlargement of Reserve of Pilots.10. In addition to war reserves of aircraft, a substantial enlargement of the reserve of pilots will be necessary. If the date of readiness for war is to be taken as the end of 1938-39, the only practical method of increasing that reserve is by a larger entry than at present of persons who could be trained in flying ab initio for Reserve Service only. As during the next four years the number of first-line units is being so largely increased, it is not possible in that period to accelerate the flow of Short Service Officers to the Reserve.Broadly speaking, the figures of personnel corresponding to the proposed provision of war reserves of aircraft would mean a further entry to the Royal Air Force Reserve of 600 pilots a year for the next three years, these being&apos; additional to the rate of entry of 200 a year to which we are now working. The increased number would involve an additional expenditure of approximately  350,000 a year for the next three years, and recurring expenditure of  200,000 annually thereafter to maintain the Reserve of direct entrants.THE FAR EAST.Hong Kong.11. The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (CCS. 344 (J.P.)) recommended a minimum of four squadrons to be kept permanently at Hong Kong for the defence of the port against Japanese attack. The Defence Requirements Report (D.R.C 14, February 1934) recommended that these squadrons should be provided with an additional aerodrome and a repair depot for their accommodation and maintenance. For financial reasons, however, the Cabinet decided, on the advice of the Ministerial Committee on Defence Requirements, that only one squadron for Hong Kong could be included in the 1934-39 programme. Under present arrangements this squadron will be provided in the financial year 1938-39.12. In view of this restricted provision the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, in a later report to the Committee of Imperial Defence, October 1934 (C.I.D. 399-C), stressed the need for facilities to enable air reinforcements to be sent to Hong Kong in an emergency, and recommended the extension of air route facilities via Burmah and via North Borneo, as well as the provision of a second aerodrome at Hong Kong itself. They also stated &quot; that the question of increasing permanently the air garrison and facilities, over and above the one squadron, should be kept under constant review.&quot;13. A site for the second aerodrome has now been selected, and considera-tion is being given to improving the existing aerodrome at Kai Tak and to increasing air facilities generally. A number of landing grounds in North Borneo are also being provided, and suitable sites are being sought for landing-grounds in Eastern Burmah. But it must be realised that even the provision of full facilities for the air reinforcement of Hong Kong will not ensure its[12270-1] f 2
defence in an emergency. Any squadrons in Iraq and India potentially available for reinforcement purposes are already earmarked for Singapore, and constitute part of the minimum requirements necessary for the security of that base in war (C.I.D. 394-C). The only other source of reinforcements is the United Kingdom, and they could not arrive at Hong Kong in time to secure it against the scale of attack which Japan could bring to bear.14. Three additional regular squadrons should therefore be provided to make up the total of four recommended as the minimum requirement for Hong Kong, together with the necessary aerodrome and maintenance facilities. The Joint Planning Sub-Committee previously recommended (C.O.S. 341-J.P.) that two squadrons should be provided for defence purposes in the first instance, followed by a third squadron for defence purposes and, finally, by a squadron for oversea reconnaissance. Of these, one squadron has already been authorised. That Sub-Committee also stated that the need for aircraft for spotting purposes must be borne in mind, and that these might be provided, as at Singapore, by an auxiliary flight raised locally. The proposals for the provision of additional air forces at Hong Kong can therefore be summarised as follows :-1 Torpedo Bomber Squadron.1 Light Bomber Squadron.1 Reconnaissance Landplane Squadron.1 Auxiliary Spotter Flight.1 Repair Depot.1 Aerodrome.Singapore.15. The scale of air defence recommended for Singapore (C.I.D. 394-C) (Revise) amounts to nine squadrons and one auxiliary flight. Of these, three squadrons are already stationed there, and one squadron at home is due to proceed to Singapore this autumn, but has been temporarily diverted to Alexandria in connection with the Abyssinian emergency. A fifth squadron has been approved for formation in 1937-38. The Auxiliary flight, which is required for spotting duties in connection with the fixed gun defences, is being formed locally, and should be available early in 1936. The remaining four squadrons are to be supplied by Iraq and India as reinforcements in an emergency.16. Of the five squadrons to be located permanently at Singapore, three are to be equipped with bomber type aircraft for offensive action against the attacking force, and two are for reconnaissance duties.17. Since the scale of air defence mentioned in paragraph 15 above was approved, the reconnaissance problem has been examined in greater detail. It has been concluded that a minimum of 28 reconnaissance aircraft are required if the sea approaches to Singapore are to be adequately covered in war. The present programme will provide only 8 flying boats for this purpose by 1936, and even when one squadron of flying boats is re-equipped with reconnaissance land planes, the total aircraft will not exceed 16. The provision of a second reconnaissance landplane squadron of 12 aircraft is therefore a matter of urgency.18. The addition of this extra squadron to the air forces permanently located at Singapore will involve additional aerodrome accommodation. The present authorised programme, when completed, will necessitate the accommoda-tion in war of three squadrons at each of the three Service aerodromes, the auxiliary spotter flight being located at the civil aerodrome. This will involve a dangerous degree of congestion, and will allow of no dispersion or depth in the air defence of the base. Moreover, on the arrival of the main fleet at Singapore, shore-base facilities will have to be provided for a large proportion of the carrier-borne air units if their efficiency is not to suffer. Under the present programme, these facilities could not be provided even with full use of the civil aerodrome, and two more operational landing grounds are required as a minimum.19. Approval should therefore be given to additional provision at Singapore for (i) 1 Landplane reconnaissance squadron, (ii) two additional landing grounds. The paramount importance of the security of Singapore in connection with the defence, of our territories and interests in the Far East, and the fact that the
situation with regard to the Japanese menace remains unchanged except in so far as it has been complicated by the growing menace from Germany, together justify a high degree of priority for these requirements.The Route to the Far East.20. The Report of the Defence Requirements Committee (D.R.C. 14) recommended the provision of one squadron each at Penang, Ceylon, and Aden, in that order of priority, by 1940. But although the need for these squadrons was recognised, the more pressing requirements of Home Defence at that time made it impossible to include them in the 1934-39 programme. As a result, the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee recommended (C.I.D. 399-C) that facilities should be arranged for at the ports in question to enable aircraft to be sent there in emergency.   The source of such reinforcements was not, however, specified.21. Four squadrons from Iraq and India are already earmarked for the reinforcement of Singapore. There can be no certainty that in a time of emergency local conditions in those countries will enable additional squadrons to be spared for employment. Moreover, the type of squadron best suited for the defence of ports and sea routes is one trained and equipped for long flights over the sea. With the exception of one flying-boat squadron normally located in the Persian Gulf no such squadrons are available outside the United Kingdom for strategic reinforcement purposes, and this squadron has already an allotted role in our Far Eastern defence plans.22. It is very desirable, therefore, that appropriately equipped squadrons, as originally recommended by the Defence Requirements Committee for Penang, Ceylon, and Aden, should be provided as soon as the requirements at Singapore have been met.General Considerations regarding the Far East.23. Although a nucleus of the Imperial air route to the Far East has been established, and the provision of subsidiary air facilities is in hand in the areas served by that route, there is at present no strategic reserve of air forces anywhere outside the United Kingdom. The local commitments of the air forces stationed permanently overseas preclude any guarantee that inter-command reinforcement will be immediately possible in an emergency. Nevertheless, in the event of war with Japan, the requirements outlined in the preceding paragraphs will be of vital importance from the outset. The provision of additional squadrons in the Middle East or Africa as proposed in paragraphs 24 and 27 below would ease the situation, and form the nucleus of a conveniently situated air reserve. Again, squadrons from the air forces of the Dominions of Australia and New Zealand may provide reinforcements at some future date. In the meanwhile, if we are to achieve a minimum degree of security vis-d-vis Japan during the danger period of the next few years, the additional squadrons recommended for singapore-pore, for ports on the route to the Far East and for Hong Kong, wall have to be provided.AFRICA.The Middle East.24. In addition to the provision of War Reserves and to the improvement of our position in the Far East, deficiencies exist in the Middle East and elsewhere in Africa. The addition of an extra squadron in the Middle East Command would assist in the reinforcement of any.threatened point on either the Australian or South African air route.25. The six squadrons already stationed in the Middle East Command have^ important commitments in Egypt,&apos; the Sudan, Palestine and Trans Jordan, and contingently, in Iraq and Cyprus. One of these squadrons is also earmarked to reinforce India, and it is doubtful whether any others could be spared to proceed further East or to other parts of Africa without weakening our air. strength in this important area.
26. It is strongly recommended, therefore, that at least one more squadron should be included for the Middle East Command in any new programme designed to strengthen our defensive position overseas.East Africa.27. A squadron in our East African territories would be a valuable addition to our resources for Imperial defence, and its concomitant aerodrome facilities would be a useful strategic link between the squadrons in the Middle East and the air forces of South Africa. The squadron would serve not only for local defence purposes, but also as a further contribution to a strategic air reserve.28. It is noteworthy that Italy has recently concentrated large air forces in her African Colonies, which are certain to be maintained there. It is important that the strategic sea route to the Far East should be secure against possible inter -ference in any contingency (apart from considerations of local prestige). A squadron located in East Africa would be a great advantage from these points of view, and its provision would be in accordance with the accepted axiom that our defence preparations should not fall so far behind as to be incapable of meeting possible changes in the internal situation.*29. A proposal is already under consideration which, if eventually approved, would ensure that the recurring costs of maintaining such a squadron would be borne by the East African Colonies themselves, the initial cost of provision being the only charge on the British exchequer.The costs of this unit are therefore included in the summary without prejudice to the deliberations on a matter which is still sub judice.West Africa.30. The scale of possible attack on the port of Freetown in the event of war with Germany was recently assessed by the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee (C.I.D. 406-C). It wras not considered to be sufficiently heavy to justify the permanent location of air forces in Sierra Leone at present. The Committee nevertheless strongly recommended that facilities should be provided to enable air forces to be flown there in emergency and to operate on arrival. They also pointed out that if at any time Freetown were to become liable to any considerable scale of air attack a nucleus air unit, as well as the means for its reinforcement, would be necessary. On a previous occasion, when our defence policy was governed by the possibility of France being the enemy, the air require-ments were stated in the following terms (J.D.C. No. 175) :  &quot;It is considered that the scale of air attack on Freetown could be effectively reduced by the provision in Sierra Leone in peace time of a total of two bomber squadrons and one fighter bomber squadron. This estimate might be reduced if there existed elsewhere in West Africa in peace time one or more squadrons available in emergency as reinforcements. In fact, provided the necessary aerodromes are prepared in peace time and provided a suitable nucleus unit is normally located in Sierra Leone, it is preferable that these squadrons should be maintained in a more central position in Africa so that they would be available for use in Sierra Leone or elsewhere as required.&quot;31. When, therefore, it becomes possible to make good deficiencies in accordance with our &apos;&apos; long range &apos;&apos; policy, three squadrons should be provided for West Africa. The air defence of those territories could not in any event be provided by hurried reinforcements. The air route from the Sudan to West Africa crosses large areas of French territory, and if our relations with France were to deteriorate it might prove very difficult to reinforce Sierra Leone from the Middle East in an emergency, even if squadrons could be made available for that purpose. It will be necessary, therefore, to provide aerodromes and a nucleus air unit as soon as the international situation indicates the desirability of such a course. The question of increasing the air forces permanently located in West Africa should also be kept under review.* N.B. Questions immediately connected with the present Abyssinian emergency are not included in the scope of the present memorandum.
MALTA.. 32. No serious threat to the security of Malta is likely to develop, except in the event of war with either Italy or France.33. It was estimated in Memorandum J.D.C. 162 that a reasonable security would be provided by two permanent squadrons in Malta for defensive purposes, in addition to the one flying boat squadron already stationed there, with an additional aerodrome for their accommodation. It was also pointed out in that paper, that the requirements of the Fleet Air Arm in a war which involved naval operations in the Mediterranean would be so large that at least two further aerodromes would be required. In January 1934 it was suggested (J.D.C. 176) that an interim provision should be made consisting of one composite squadron and one additional aerodrome. Later, in April of that year, after consideration of a War Office request that spotter aircraft should be provided, it was recom-mended (J.D.C. 180) that this composite squadron should consist of two flights of torpedo-bombers, one flight of fighter bombers and one flight of spotters. The additional aerodrome has now been sanctioned and two squadrons are being sent to Malta temporarily. It is suggested that two squadrons for defensive purposes and one spotter flight should be permanently provided for Malta as soon as other more urgent requirements have been met. As an interim provision the provision of the Composite Squadron is recommended as soon as the aerodrome is completed.The whole problem of the defence of Malta may, however, require fundamental reconsideration in the light of recent events.GIBRALTAR.34. The bridging of the gap which up to now has existed in our air communications between the United Kingdom and the Middle East would in the near future enable mutual air reinforcement between the United Kingdom and our overseas possessions to be carried out. It has long been our aim to establish an &quot; all British &quot; route for this purpose, but in the past the limitations of flying range and the lack of suitably spaced landing grounds in British territory have made such flights impracticable for aircraft. The first of these difficulties has now practically disappeared, and within a few years a large proportion of Royal Air Force squadrons will be equipped with aircraft capable of flying direct to Gibraltar (the longest stage in the route) and thence to Malta and the Middle East. The provision of an adequate intermediate air base at Gibraltar is therefore the key to the whole strategic conception of Imperial defence, and, consequently, a matter of first importance.There are considerable difficulties in the way of providing, the required aerodrome facilities, and as the air base will be the terminal of long flights over the sea and there will be no possibility of aircraft turning back on arrival to an intermediate landing ground in British territory, it is important that such facilities should be adequate under all circumstances. Meteorological conditions are sometimes indifferent, and air disturbances caused by the mass of the Rock are often prejudicial to the operation of aircraft in certain areas. Very little level ground is available, and such as exists is already used in providing various social and recreational facilities for the population as well as training grounds for the troops of the Garrison. There is also the close proximity of Spanish territory, over which accidental or unavoidable air trespasses might lead to difficulties with the Spanish Government.A preliminary investigation of the problem has shown, however, that these difficulties are not insuperable, and reclamation of ground from the sea, together with the use of a portion of the existing level space, may afford a satisfactory solution of the problem. Detailed consideration of this project has not yet been possible, nor could any reliable estimate of the cost at present be framed. The outstanding advantages to be gained by completing this essential link in our Imperial air communications would, in the opinion of the Air Ministry, fully justify a very considerable expenditure.
WEST INDIES.35. The increasing ranges and potentialities of aircraft make it essential to look well ahead when considering the problem of protecting our sea-borne trade against air and surface attack.In the near future air protection will be required at the ports and in the open sea on the Atlantic trade routes, as on those other routes now within the orbit of our overseas air bases. For the protection of our South American trade, aircraft will eventually be required at Trinidad and in West Africa. For the Panama, U.S.A., and Canadian trade, aircraft will be required in the West Indies, Bermuda and Newfoundland. For these purposes nucleus facilities must soon be provided including at least one squadron of aircraft in the West Indies.FLEET AIR ARM.36. The Defence Requirements Committee (D.R.C. 14); recommended the provision of 51 additional Fleet Air Arm aircraft to make good deficiencies in existing complements, and of a further 192 aircraft for New Construction and to keep pace with the Japanese Naval air expansion, making a total strength of 402 aircraft by 1940. On the advice of the Ministerial Committee on Defence Requirements, the Cabinet decided in July 1934 (Cabinet 31 (34) ) that the deficiency of 51 aircraft (4^ squadrons) should be made good in addition to any further aircraft required for the new carrier (H.M.S. Ark Royal) and for new cruisers of the 1933-34, 1934-35 and 1935-36 programme. On this basis the strength of the Fleet Air Arm by April 1939, would be raised from its strength of 190 to a total of about 277 first-line aircraft, the exact number being dependent upon the progress of ship construction.It will be seen that on the basis of the recommendation of the Defence Requirements Committee 125 first-line aircraft would still be required to reach a total strength of 402 aircraft, but the Admiralty have now informed the Air Ministry that subsequent developments make it necessary to increase this figure-to 504, by 1941 or 1942. &apos;ARMY CO-OPERATION.37. The recommendation of the War Office that 12 Territorial Army Divisions (of which 8 will be ready in the first six months) should be equipped on a scale to enable them to take part in military operations against a major Power, will involve the provision of air units for &apos;&apos; Army Co-operation &apos;&apos; duties with those divisions. As it is not contemplated the Territorial Divisions will begin to go overseas in less than four months after the outbreak of war, the Air Ministry suggest that the necessary aircraft co-operation could be effectively and most conveniently provided by units of the Auxiliary Air Force. There will be sufficient time after the outbreak of war to complete their training to the necessary standard.38. Sources of recruitment for the Auxiliary Air Force are, however, limited, and it is not possible to count upon recruiting more than 20 Auxiliary Squadrons as maximum. In the scheme for the employment of the Auxiliary Air Force to which the Air Ministry are at present working, there will be 16 squadrons in all. They are required for Home Defence, and form an integral part of the programme for maintaining Metropolitan parity with Germany.39. The Air Ministry propose that the 8 squadrons required for co-operation with the 8 Territorial Divisions shall be provided, as to 4 of them, by forming 4 new Auxiliary Air Force Squadrons and by thus bringing their number up from 16 to 20; and as to the remaining 4, by converting existing Bomber squadrons of the Auxiliary Air Force into Army Co-operation squadrons and replacing them in the Home Defence Force by 4 regular units.40. Future requirements for the Army are likely to include (a) the provision of two more squadrons, making ten in all, for co-operation with Territorial
I&quot; 12270-1Divisions; (b) Spotter Flights, probably three in all, for co-operation with Coast Defences; (c) a squadron for communication purposes to accompany the first contingent of the Field Force.No financial provision for any of these three requirements is included in the present proposals.41. Provision is also made for converting the 5 squadrons of 18 aircraft each, at present allotted to the Field Force, to 7 squadrons of 12 aircraft each.INDIA.42. The Sub-Committee should realise that no provision is made for war reserves for the air forces in India. It is desirable that an early agreement must be reached with the Indian Government in this regard and it may be that additional reserves will have to be held in the United Kingdom against Indian requirements.SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS AND ESTIMATED COST.43. It is not possible to specify exact dates by which the various deficiencies above should be made good. The programme will depend on many factors, particularly on financial considerations and on the requirements of the other Services. The purpose of the new enquiry by the Defence Requirements Committee is to review all these factors, and to draw up a balanced programme for meeting all defence requirements. The summary appended sets out the Royal Air Force requirements in two Parts, and includes a general estimate of the cost of each item. Part I contains a list of those deficiencies which should be made good with the least possible delay mainly to keep pace with the expansion of the forces of Germany and Japan. Part II contains a statement of other requirements for which provision should be made in any long-range programme designed to ensure that our defence preparations are adequate to meet all probable contingencies.(Signed) E.

Items 3 to 6 (inclusive) were recommendations of the Defence Require-ments Committee (March 1934). Item 11 also was a recommendation of that Committee up to a strength of 402 first-line aircraft: the higher number of 504 is in accordance with the latest available estimate by the Admiralty of the air requirements of the Fleet.* The present strength of the Fleet Air Arm, including provision being made in 1935, is 190 first-line aircraft. The programme of expansion formally approved by the Government in July 1934 for the period 1934-38 was for a first-line strength of 213 aircraft (plus any further aircraft necessary in that period for new carriers or for new cruisers). The above estimates are for expansion from 213 to 504 first-line aircraft and include only items (i.e., works and training) falling as a net charge on Air Votes. The cost of the aircraft is contained in the Admiralty programme.

War reserves to be adequate must cover war wastage until it is overtaken by the war output of industry. An accurate estimate of probable output from industry cannot be made in the absence of concrete plans for industrial mobilisation on the lines envisaged by the P.S.O. Committee.2. To provide the information required by the D.P.R. Committee a pre-liminary investigation has been made of the potential output of the aircraft industry in war. From this it is apparent that, even allowing for extensive preparations in peace time, aircraft and engine reserves must be sufficient to cover wastage in the first four months of war. Similar considerations apply to other classes of technical equipment; but for bombs, ammunition and pyrotechnics a six months&apos; reserve is required. The industrial capacity in peace time for the manufacture of bombs, explosives and machine-guns is in general so small that immediate measures must be taken to expand this capacity so as to constitute an adequate basis for war expansion. For this purpose an estimated expenditure of  2,100,000 is required on additional plant, jigs and tools.   The reserves of[12270-1] &apos; h

Apart from initial cost of provision, it must be realised that if the war reserve for Home Defence is to consist of up-to-date aircraft it will be necessary to provide for the regular withdrawal of obsolete aircraft from the reserve. The rapid rate of progress in design will make this a problem of much difficulty. It would be imprudent to estimate (if an adequate reserve of up-to-date aircraft is to be permanently maintained) for a net annual replacement expenditure of less than 12 per cent, of the initial cost of provision, approximately  34,000,000 (Home Defence  29,000,000, F.A.A.  5,200,000) of the reserves of aircraft and other material subject to obsolescence:  4,000,000. In addition, it will be necessary periodically to replace most of the equipment, (jigs, gauges and tools) and some manufactured parts provided under (d) above for industrial mobilisation. As far as can be at present foreseen, a sum of  1,000,000 annually would be required to keep the equipment under (d) up to date.mechanical transport vehicles are based on initial requirements only and&apos; will have to be supplemented by extensive impressment of civil transport vehicles when the emergency arises.3. Details of reserve requirements are contained in the Tabular Statement below. The scale adopted for each item is indicated as far as possible with the estimated cost of making good deficiencies. The estimates are based on current prices; the tendency of aircraft, in particular, to increase in cost with growth in size and complexity has not been taken into account. The total expenditure would be in the order of  50,000,000 up to the end of the financial year 1938-39.4. The total capital cost of providing additional storage accommodation for war reserves is estimated at  2,750,000.   The details are as follows :-(a) Engines, spare parts, aircraft equipment  and mechanical transport     ...          ... 1,000,000(6) Aircraft       ...          ...          ...          ... 1,250,000(c) Bombs           ...          ...          ...          ... 500,000Nothing has been included for storage in respect of petrol as it is proposed to arrange for the supply Companies to provide this. The estimated annual cost of this arrangement is  175,000. It may also be convenient to arrange for air-craft firms to provide some of the storage for aircraft on a similar basis.5. The adequacy of the proposed reserves is dependent on the existence of effective plans for the mobilisation of industry on the outbreak of war. The assumptions which have been made could only be justified if these plans are complete in every respect. Until they have been developed only a tentative estimate can be given for the expenditure which will be necessary to establish the requisite stocks of jigs, tools, gauges, special machinery, raw material and semi-manufactured parts for accelerating output as quickly as possible on the outbreak of war. Preliminary investigations suggest that an initial expenditure of about  8,000,000 would be required for this purpose. This amount would be additional to the  2,100,000 (referred to in paragraph 2 above) for developing manufacturing facilities of bombs.6. On the above basis the expenditure up to the end of 1938-39 for provision and storage of war reserves and for provision of jigs, tools, &amp;c, would be broadly as follows : (a)   To provide War Reserve of Aircraft, &amp;c.

The recommendation of the Departmental Defence Requirements Committee (D.R.C. 14 February 1934) in respect of (a) war . reserves, (b) additional squadrons overseas, and (c) additional aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm would have involved capital expenditure of (approximately)  11,000,000 between 1934 and 1938 inclusive, with further capital expenditure of  4,400,000 in 1939 and 1940.   Total:  15,400,000.2. The sum for capital expenditure under these three heads which would have been available by 1938 under the recommendation of the Ministerial Committee would not exceed  1,200,000 for works and initial equipment for overseas squadrons;  500,000 for initial equipment for Fleet Air Arm deficiencies; and  1,200,000 for War Reserves.   Total :  2,400,000.3. The difference between the capital expenditure recommended for war reserves, overseas requirements and the Fleet Air Arm under the proposals of the original Defence Requirements Committee, and the expenditure contemplated by the recommendations of the Ministerial Committee was thus  13,000,000 ( 15,400,000 less  2,400,000 ^  13,000,000).4. The difference between  13,000,000 and the sum of (approximately)  73,000,000 now proposed is due (a) chiefly to the fact that war reserves have to be provided for on a larger scale in face of German rearmament, and for 123 squadrons at home as compared with 52 squadrons under the earlier scheme; also (b) to the inclusion of some deficiencies not covered by the original Defence Requirement Report, e.g., squadrons for Middle East, Malta, East Africa; (c) to increases in cost of the later types of aircraft which have emerged since D.R.C. 14 was prepared; and (d) to provision being included for holding jigs, &amp;c, for immediate acceleration of production at outbreak of war.. Air Ministry, October 1935.
314&quot;Copy No.   8 schedule IV TO D.R.C. 37The Problem of Making Good the Army&apos;s Deficiencies, and the Rate at which they can be RemediedNote by the Master-General of the OrdnanceThe total of Army deficiencies in war material amounts to 111 millions^.      57 Manifestly such a sum cannot be expended on a 3-year programme.   But although , General this is a formidable undertaking, it is not impossible to arrive within sight of completion     7813 on a 5-year programme.   It is observed that the critical date can hardly be earlier and may well be later than that given in D.P.R. paper No. 12.It is reasonable therefore to base ourselves on a 5-year programme on an ascending scale of expenditure and to endeavour to show progressive rates of readiness as far as one is able to estimate them.Estimates must of necessity be very approximate, because, firstly we are dealing with a project which in this country, at all events, is an entirely new departure, and secondly, the explorations of the Supply Board Technical Establishment as to productive capacity were to cover a period of five years, of which only eighteen months have elapsed.2. It is necessary here to state in broad outline the only method by which very large deficiencies in war material can be supplied and at the same time a potential for the much greater quantities required after the outbreak of war, can be built up. It is the method long since advocated by Lord Weir and accepted by the P.S.O. Committee, under the the name of the Shadow Armament Industry. In principle it is excessively simple ; its application is governed mainly by a regular supply of funds assured in advance.The principle is briefly this. Firms who do not normally make warlike stores are engaged to do so by placing orders with them for relatively small output of peace production on the condition that they lay out their works and hold machinery for a war output which represents their peace output many times, multiplied, e.g., tenfold.It is to be noted that whereas the Shadow Armament Industry scheme applies essentially to new firms, it may be applied equally to existing contractors to expand their &quot; war potential.&quot;3. Obviously certain conditions are necessary : (a) An approved long term programme guaranteeing funds to the Department.(b) Continuity of orders to the trade so that contractors may be attracted by&quot; business propositions.&quot;(c) Continuity of orders so that personnel and especially supervisory staffs may be trained.(cl) Subsidies, whether taken up in the cost of the produced article or in direct payment, so that plants may be balanced and maintained to create a &quot; war potential.&quot;(e) Greater recourse may be necessary to non-competitive contracts, but machinery exists by which, under ministerial authority, this can be arranged.Finally we cannot run this project on a system of secrecy from Whitehall. I am convinced that leaders of industry should be taken into confidence and it be put before them that we are working to meet a national emergency, possible or even probable in a few years time. Further it is very necessary that we should enlist not only the good-will of the manufacturer but also his ideas and productive experience. But the first essential in our democratic state is for the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to be publicly announced, not by a P.S.O. of a Defence department but by a minister of the Crown. Reasoned publicity, and consultation with industry, I believe to be essential to success.* Excluding Works Services.
4. I have dealt above with manufacture in or by the trade. To complete our war requirements there is a large range of output which is either non-existent in the trade or covers so small a proportion of our eventual requirements that we must rely largely on Government factories. This field of activity is mainly occupied by the requirements for explosives and propellants and for the filling of shells, cartridges, fuzes, bombs and torpedoes.Here we have no option but to extend our Government factories and put down capital.5. I endeavour now to answer the questions set forth in the Conclusions on Paper D.P.R. 12 and in doing so I must emphasize that the estimates given must be regarded as tentative because there are a large number of factors of which we have as yet little experience.        - -Conclusion (i) as stated above the requirements of the Army cannot be met on a three-year programme. Of the total of deficiencies in war material amounting to 111 million some 48 million represents &quot;the limit of practicability&quot; i.e., the amounts that it is estimated could be spent by March 31st, 1939, if the order to proceed were given now.   The state of the Army as regards war material would then be : A.D.G.B. Half of the present deficiencies made good.. Ports. The more important major deficiencies made good.Field Force 1st Contingent. 80 per cent, of deficiencies remedied.The shortages will inevitably fall on ammunition, tanks and guns.2nd Contingent.

The special measures for increasing factory production are outlined at paragraphs 3 and 4 above.   The cost is estimated at some  14 million.9. Conclusion (ii) (b).  Question 1. &quot; If no special measures were taken as regarded factory output, what state of preparedness would we be able to achieve by that date ? &quot;In such a case we should be thrown back mainly on our existing resources plus such few contractors as might be persuaded to enlarge their facilities.It is estimated that we should get a &quot;spend&quot; of some  21 million in three years as against  48 million above. Our &quot;war potential&quot; would remain practically as it stands to-day (e.g. in the case of ammunition requirements we are deficient of some 85 per cent, in the first year of war), all of which would have to be created after mobilization.Assuming an expenditure on A.D.G.B. and ports as at paragraph 5 above, the 1st Contingent of the Field Force would still be short of 50 per cent, of its present deficiencies and have no &quot; war potential &quot; behind it. It might be maintained for perhaps four months in the field a repetition of L914.Question 2. &quot; Or, alternatively, how long a period would be required to reach the same state of preparedness as in (a) above ? &quot;

The corollary is that one would have to hold reserves ready in peace to cover the period of development of &quot; war potential,&quot; which in these circumstances might be anything from nine months to one year. (It will be remembered that in 1918 after the Ministry of Munitions had been in existence two years it needed a full 12 months to build and get in production a new factory.) I estimate that our total stocks would have to be nearly doubled in money value. That gives a figure of  150/200 million which we might spend in 15/20 years.
SCHEDULE V TO D.R.C. 37.Estimate of Air Raid Precautions Requirements, 1936-39.Memorandum, prepared by the Air Raid Precautions Department, Home Office.THE following is a very approximate estimate of air raid precautions requirements up to 1939, so far as can be seen at present.The completion of the equipment has been fixed at 1939 in accordance with the present Committee of Imperial Defence ruling.* It is realised that this might be subject to modification one way or the other.A brief note is attached explaining such details as would seem necessary for the estimates properly to be understood.Respirators.(a) General Service type.It is estimated that approximately 400,000 General Service respirators will be required for air raid precautions services (e.g., police, fire brigades, first aid and medical services, decontamination squads, gas detectors). The cost of these respirators is approximately 18s., produced under Government auspices. The Government has undertaken the responsibility for a supply of these respirators to all local authorities in accordance with requirements.400,000 General Service respirators at 18s. each =  360,000.(b) Special Service type.It is estimated that approximately 400,000 Special Service respirators will be required for air raid precautions services (e.g., for the balance of personnel of the organisations mentioned above who do not require the General Service respirator). These respirators cost approximately 8s. each produced under Government auspices.The Government have undertaken to supply these respirators to all the local authorities in accordance with their requirements.400,000 Special Service respirators at 8s. each^  160,000.(c) General Civilian respirator.A recommendationt has gone to the Cabinet from the Air Raid Precautions (Policy) Sub-Committee to the effect that the Government should accumulate supplies of a simple respirator for free issue to those members of the general population who are not in possession of respirators of their own if an emergency should ever arise.If this recommendation is accepted it is estimated that at least 30 million respirators will be required, though this number might have to be increased to approximately 40 million if the entire population is required to be issued with respirators. The 30 million proposed covers all those areas in which air attack is most probable, but omits areas in the extreme west, south-west and north-west, in which the risk is probably extremely remote. The population of these remote areas amounts to 10  million.These respirators are not suitable for use by children under five years of age. The numbers of children under this age represent about 7 per cent, of the population.   The question of their protection is dealt with below.The cost of the civilian respirator is approximately 2s., though it is possible that this figure may be capable of reduction in view of the large quantities* C.I.D. 266th Meeting, Conclusion 1 (a), t CP. 202 (35), also A..E.P. (P) 42. [12270-11 i
required; however, the question of storage must be taken into account. A figure of 2s. per respirator is, therefore, quoted as being probably reasonably near the mark. 30,000,000 General Civilian respirators at 2s. each = 3,000,000 If a further 10,000,000 are required, cost - ...     ^ 1,000,000Possible total     .........     = 4,000,000Children.A device is being developed which, it is hoped, may provide protection for children under the age of five. At this stage it is only possible tentatively to quote a price for this requirement, i.e., half-a-crown. It is conceivable that this price may be susceptible to reduction. If a favourable decision is taken by the Cabinet, on the recommendation of the Air Raid Precautions (Policy) Sub-Committee, it would seem inevitable that provision will be required, in addition, for children for whom the General Civilian respirator is unsuitable.The number of children in the potential dangerous parts of the country is approximately 2\ million.In the western, south-western and north-western areas the number is approximately f million.The total possible requirements for children, therefore, is as follows :  2,500,000 apparatus at 2s. Qd. = (approximately) ...     315,000 750,000 apparatus at 2s. 6d.^ (approximately) ...      95,000Protective Clothing.The present ideas in regard to protective clothing will probably be subject to radical change if, as is understood, the process known as &quot; impregnation &quot; is successful.This process is under active investigation, and it is understood that, in the near future, it will have reached a stage when its practical application can be investigated. This process may, it is hoped, result in a considerable saving of money, particularly from the replacement point of view, and may incidentally also effect a saving in personnel, since protective clothing at present is a great handicap&apos; and active manual work cannot be carried out in it except for comparatively short periods.Since the whole proposal is in rather an embryo state, it is only possible to put forward a very tentative figure, and, in point of fact, no sum is being included in the Home Office estimates next year for the provision of this clothing, pending what is hoped to be the favourable result of the productive experiments in impregnation.The figure proposed under this heading is  250,000. In any event, the Government have undertaken to make free provision for essential air raid services.Bleach Powder.Bleach powder is a consumable article which deteriorates if kept in store for any length of time.The whole question is before the Principal Supply Officers Committee, and the proposal is that arrangements should be made if possible with Imperial Chemical Industries by which they would guarantee a certain minimum supply of bleach, in time of emergency in return for the payment of a subsidy.This arrangement is not in any way settled, and has not been discussed, I believe, with Imperial Chemical Industries.The stock of bleach which should be immediately available on the outbreak of war, and which would be required to last until further production was available, is 25,000 tons, which, at present prices, is equal to a sum of  200,000.Assuming a subsidy of 10 per cent, had to be paid in the form of interest on this capital, then an amount of approximately  60,000 would have to be found over the period of the next three years.The suggested requirement under this heading is, therefore,  60,000.
4-9Hospital Equipment.The Government have undertaken what is, at present, a rather undefined commitment in regard to the supply of certain hospital equipment which might be deficient on the outbreak of war. In general, expenditure under this head will only be required if an emergency ever arose, but there may be certain things of a non-consumable nature, e.g., stretchers, which it might be essential to accumulate beforehand owing to supply difficulties. The figure appropriated to this account is, therefore, a very approximate estimate.Estimate for hospital equipment,  300,000.General Remarks.If an emergency ever arose the Government would clearly be faced with considerable expenditure for providing certain protective arrangements which might be held, rightly or wrongly, by local authorities to be part of the national service. At this stage it. is quite impossible to produce any figure of possible expenditure, nor, presumably, is it required, since we are dealing only with provisions or deficiencies which ought to be accumulated in time of peace.There is another very important aspect of air raid precautions, to which reference is made, although again it is quite impossible to suggest any figure of expenditure even if His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplated that action would be required.The information which this Department is collecting will certainly show that there are certain vital industries which, for a variety of reasons connected with their geographical situation, their lay-out, and their vulnerability to air attack, cannot be given any reasonable degree of protection; that is to say, any measures which it may be possible for this Department to recommend will only be in the nature of palliatives and will be quite ineffective against determined air attack.In some cases, for example, Billingham, the production may be an absolutely vital element in time of war, and, as things stand at present, complete destruction or disorganisation by hostile air attack is a factor which cannot be left out of account, the results of which might be very far-reaching. To contemplate moving an enormous works of this kind is probably entirely out of the question; but it may well be necessary for the Government to consider whether some alternative might not have to be encouraged which might entail a subsidy, or whether an accumulation of adequate reserves in a less vulnerable part of the country might not be essential. Until this Department has completed its survey it will not be possible to picture the situation, and certain elements of this situation are probably already being actively investigated and considered by the Defence Departments. As and when, however, this Department gathers information which is considered to be of particular national importance, special appreciations will be put forward for the consideration of the Committee of Imperial Defence. In any such appreciations two aspects will be considered : first of all, the vulnerability of the factory or undertaking itself, together with the effect of any protective measures which may be recommended; and, secondly, the vulnerability of the factory or undertaking from the point of view of the supplies on which it depends for its operation, e.g., water, gas, electricity. Every undertaking is really vulnerable, therefore, from two aspects : its own, and the sources of power on which it depends for its operation.In connection with this alternative there must also be taken into account the vital necessity for maintaining the life of the country even at a minimum standard. Gas, for example, plays a tremendous part since in London something like 90 per cent, of the population depend on the supply for their cooking. This problem is being actively investigated in consultation with all those concerned. It may again be found that certain measures could be taken which would go a considerable way towards guaranteeing at least a minimum supply. Such measures would probably cost money, and the point may arise as to whether such money, if it is to be spent, can properly be considered to be a charge on the central Government, or whether it is a matter for the undertaking itself to shoulder in view of its large public responsibilities. The most practical example that can be given at the moment has just recently come to light. The Gas Light and Coke Company have stated that, if an extra booster was installed at their
Beckton works, they could probably guarantee supplies of gas to their consumers even though the works suffered considerable damage, and always, naturally, providing that pipes in the streets remained in a reasonable state of integrity. The cost of this booster is understood to be  150,000. This example is not put forward for definite consideration in any way at this stage; it is merely quoted to illustrate the point in mind.As with other vital matters, any points of this kind will be the subject of special reports at convenient intervals.Estimate Covering the Years 1936-39.Respirators  ^ ^400,000 General Service respirators        ...... ?2n iXn400,000 Special Service respirators          ... ^rYnori40,000,000 General Civilian respirators 4&apos;^^&apos;^a3,250,000 Apparatus-Protection for children      ... tV^nnnProtective Clothing    ...      ...                        ......
