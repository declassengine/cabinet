(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE.PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.iV*&quot;j^S T   SECRET. (56).CABINET. AIR STRIKING FORCE. Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Air.The Air Ministry have been directed by the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements to review the. existing programme of squadrons to be formed and stationed at home, in order to see how best we can improve the offensive power of this force and constitute the most effective deterrent against German aggression.The original programme produced in June of last year and approved by the Cabinet constituted the most effective force it was then possible to say with reasonable certainty was within the competence of the industry in design and manufacture, and of the Air Ministry to recruit and train by March 31st, 1957.      Since then we have pressed on with the development and production of new types, and the results obtained and in sight justify the Air Staff in formulating a much more effective programme, which we hope can be realised by 1939.It will be recalled that the programme approved last year included 30 squadrons of light bombers.      It was appreciated that this was a weakness in the programme from the point of view of its main objective, namely, a striking force against and deterrent to, Germany.      These squadrons suffered a double disadvantage.      Their load of bombs was relatively small, and worse still, their range was strictly limited.      They could not operate against German territory unless they were based in or could refuel in Northern France or Belgium.      But in June last year we were
faced with, this position - the new types of medium &quot;bomber were highly speculative and entirely unproved.     We did in fact gamble by placing orders &quot;off the drawing-board1&apos; for machines embodying new and. untried features.     But we were bound to reinsure by orders of known types.     Moreover, we had to go first for machines of. which we could get early delivery, otherwise the training and formation, of squadrons would have been, indefinitely delayed, and there would besides have been a hopeless congestion in production, as the new types began to come forward.- Fortunately, we have been directed to make this review, and to recast our programme at a time when we can, without taking&apos; unjustifiable risks, concentrate our further orders on new types of greatly improved performance*Broadly, the plan now proposed is to convert the light bomber- squadrons as envisaged in the earlier programme into medium bomber squadrons, and also to enlarge the establishment of 29 out of the 48 medium bomber squadrons from 12 to 18 and 2 T.-B* squadrons from 12 to 16*      In addition to this increase in the numbers of machines, it has been decided in future to train the bomber squadrons to operate in flights of 5 instead of 3-.-      In the result a squadron will operate in a tactical formation of 15 as against 9, thereby increasing its offensive force..     It is important that no publicity should be given to this new tactical development, until the inevitable disclosure is made by squadrons at exercise..The increases in the establishment referred to above will make an addition, of&quot; 182 machines to our first-line strength.-But the great improvement in the offensive and deterrent power lies in the capabilities of the machines themselves as compared with the light bombers.
As regards range,  if our present estimates of performance are achieved (and in some cases our latest machines seem likely to exceed their promise) we should he able -(a) using the largest type of medium bomber, to drop1 ton of bombs per aircraft on any point in Germany:(b) using the smaller medium bombers, to drop 1,000 lb.-of bombs per aircraft at any point in Western Germany, that is, West of a line drawn from Kiel to Stuttgart, and in certain circumstances to reach Berlin. The attached map shows the area which would come within the normal, range of the medium bombers.,&apos;Lastly, the bomb load is much greater.      The normal load will be from 1,000 to 2,000 lb.., compared with 500 lb., for the light bomber,.     Moreover, unlike the light bomber class, some of the medium bombers will be capable of taking a large overload, with a small diminution in speed.We propose that the delivery of light bombers now on order should be completed-,      These machines are required for the equipment of squadrons until replaced by later types, and will thereafter be used for the equipment and reserves of training units, and for the replacement of obsolescent machines for some of the overseas squadrons, which for strategic and tactical reasons it is desired should remain as light bombers..The future orders for the equipment of the medium bomber squadrons will all be for machines of the new types, single and twin engine, which are now coming forward.      By bringing in the shadow &quot;industry as recommended in the report (which would be necessary whether the change of type is made or not) we hope to be able to complete the programme, including all or a large part of the reserves,  on the approved scale, by 1939,.
There has not yet &quot;been time to work out the scheme in all its details, hut as at present estimated the proposed change will involve the establishment of three new stations, and the erection of 9 to 12 new hangars on stations already in &quot;being or provided for In the existing approved plans.      Orders placed for hangars under these plans have wisely allowed for the possibility of accommodating the larger type of machine, though they will of course hold smaller numbers.There will he some consequent increase in personnel, -but we believe this is within our capacity.The proposed change inevitably involves a considerable increase in cost-     The larger and more powerful machines are much more expensive.      It is not possible to give more than an approximate figure, hut prohably the change means an addition of something in the region of  12,500,000 in original capital cost, and  2,000,000 a year in recurrent expenditure for maintenance, replacement, etc.      But I am sure the Cabinet will agree that we should &quot;be wrong to go forward and spend what must in any case be a great sum on machines of far inferior striking and deterrent power, when it is possible for us to secure so much more effective a force indeed to secure for the first -time a force which is a real reply t the German menace..The Cabinet will wish to know that on the defence side one new fighter is now flying which exceeds its specified or expected performance, and a second type, which the makers expect will be-equally good, will be flying in a few weeks.I should add that the selection of types for the revised programme, while chosen on merits, will also enable us to con-centrato the production of the principal firms on fewer types of machines.
The revised programme and its provisional allocation among firms has &quot;been fully discussed with Lord Weir, who is in complete agreement.If the above proposals are adopted, the structure of the Striking Force (first line) would be as followsHeavy bombersLarge medium bombersTorpedo bombersSmaller medium bombers20 squadrons (12 machines) 8 squadrons (12 machines)2 squadrons (16 machines)29 regularsquadrons (18 machines)11 auxiliarysquadrons (12 machines)240 96325221321,022S.AIR MINISTRY.10th February, 1936.,.
