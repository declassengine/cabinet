(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)S E C R E T.C.P. 52(56). Copy No: 3G A B I N E T. TRIAL OF PEERS BY PEERS. MEMORANDUM BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR.On the 4th February, Viscount Sarikey will move to resolve, That the present system of Trial of Peers by Peers has outlived its usefulness,  and Lord Rarrkeillour will move (as an amendment to this motion)  to insert after the second (&quot;Peers&quot;), (&quot;in cases of felony&apos;&apos;).The grounds on which peers charged with treason or felony are entitled to be tried by their peers form a subject for the historian,  and I make no claim to decide historical questions with authority.It has been stated that fourteenth century jurists based the right of Peers to be tried by Peers on the principle that even the King,  through his justices,  could not he judge in his own cause, and,  therefore, in cases where tenants-in-chief were accused of treason or felony and, if convicted, would forfeit their lands to the Crown, they could he judged only by their peers.      Forfeiture for treason or felony was finally abolished, by statute in 1870. Any pecuniary interest that the Crown may be thought to have had in securing a conviction has therefore now disappeared.Furthermore,  the power of the Crown to secure a conviction on improper grounds or for improper purposes In a trial before the ordinary King&apos;s Courts has gradually disappeared,  as by successive steps the Justiciary has been made independent of the Executive, and a Peer could now obtain as fair a trial before a High Court Judge and a jury as he could &quot;before his peers.
The privilege has some times been supported from a different point of view.      It has been contended that a famous passage in Magna Carta means that a man. ought not to be tried by his inferiors, and,  therefore,  that a peer ought not to be tried by an ordinary Judge and jury.      This con-tention is probably without historical foundation,  and in any case it would be difficult in the twentieth century to support the privilege on this ground.     further, if such a contention were valid,  it would apply also to misaemean-our, and a Peer is tried for misdemeanour before the ordinary courts.Some of the disadvantages of the  trial of a Peer by his peers have been exemplified in the recent trial of Lord de Clifford.First there is the expense to the accused and the delay.      The law applies regardless of the wishes of the accused.      The trial must have cost Lord de Clifford many hundreds of pounds more than if he had been tried like a commoner:    he was tried at least two months later than if he had been tried at the Old Bailey:    and,  as he was also charged with a misdemeanour arising on the same set of facts, he was in jeopardy and. was put upon his trial twice over.The public expense is also considerable.      The Royal Gallery was fitted up for the trial at a cost of  700. The Attorney-General himself   was briefed for the prose-cution.      Further,  whereas the trial    of    a   commoner for felony occupies the time    of one    High Court Judge only,  and not even that if the felony is tried - as many felonies are - at Quarter Sessions or Petty Sessions,  the trial of Lord de Clifford occupied a whole judicial day of the valuable and highly-paid time of seven Lords of Appeal in
Ordinary and seven Judges of the Supreme Court,  and caused serious delay in the judicial work of the House of Lords and perhaps other tribunals.But the trial of Lord de Clifford was unusually rapid,      A trial might well last for many days.        As the Peerage now stands,   the number of Peers entitled to be summoned is more than 600.      Every peer who attends is a judge of law as well as fact.        Every question of law arising in the course of the trial,  including points which would be disposed of in two minutes by a single judge, must be considered by the whole body of peers, who retire for that purpose from the place of trial to another chamber.This feature of the tribunal, besides prolonging the trial, may have a more serious aspect.      A decision of the House of Lords is binding on all other courts in the country,   and the risk that a difficult question of criminal law might be wrongly decided by a majority of lasers in such a trial is by no means negligible.The unw/leldiness of the tribunal has grown with the centuries.       In 1603 the Lords of parliament numbered only 86;    in 1695 they still numbered only about 176,   and by that time it had long been the practice for the Crown through the Lord High Steward to summon,  not all the Peers, taut only such of them as the Crown thought fit.        The privilege had thus become not a protection against the Crown, but a weapon in the hands of the Crown.      It was to restore the protection that an Act was passed in 1695, compelling the Crown to summon all the Peers of parliament without exception.The Act applies to treason,  not felony, but it has become the custom to summon all the Peers of Parliament in the case of felony,  and if the custom were superseded,
the accused might at the present day he said to have less protection against the Executive than if he irere tried like a commoner before an ordinary Court0Lord Eankeillour&apos;s amendment seems to me unsoundo The modern House of Lords is at least as unwieldy a tribunal for the trial of treason as it is for the trial of felony, and any attempt to go back upon the Act of 1695 would be a move in the wrong direction,,     A tribunal consisting of Peers selected by the Lord High Steward would in theory give the accused less protection against the Executive than if he were tried like a commoner9 and I doubt if there  is any satisfactory way of preserving the privilege even for treason,It is necessary that some opinion on the motion should be expressed on behalf of the Governments and I should normally be the person to express it..     So far I have not committed myself further than to  say in resisting a motion to change a custom with regard to the clothes worn by Peers at the trial:    &quot;I think that there is a good deal to be said for taking the view that this manner of trial has outlived its usefulness and that your Lordships&apos; House might think it desirables perhaps on an early occasions to express an opinion to that effects but .  .  0  so long as the old method of trial is maintained etc.&quot;     My own view is that the matter should be left to the free discussion of the House of Lordss and that if a substantial majority of the House is in favour of the motion and if a Bill is introduced to give effect to their resolutions the House should be told that the Government will adopt a benevolent attitude with regard to the Bill? and will do its best to
find time for its consideration in the House of Commons, unless the discussion there is likely to prove unduly long.I ask for the authority of my colleagues to take this course.The Home Secretary has been good enough to read this memorandum and to give it his approval.(Intd.) H.House of Lords 527th January5 1936.
