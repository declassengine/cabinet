THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1936.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 20 (36).CABINET.EXTENSION OF MILK ACT,  1934.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary ofState for Scotland.1. THE Milk Act, 1934, made provision (1) designed to encourage a greater consumption of liquid milk; (2) for securing an improvement in the quality of the milk supply; and (3) for safeguarding the prices received by the home producer. These pi-provisions were limited in time owing to the great desirability of keeping the position closely under review.2. The Act accordingly authorised certain payments from the Exchequer in respect of milk sold for manufacture in the United Kingdom (Sections 1 and 6); used for manufacture by Milk Marketing Boards (Section 2); converted into cheese on farms in Great Britain (Section 3).These provisions expire on the 31st March, 1936. The Act also authorised certain payments for the purpose of schemes for stimulating the consumption of liquid milk, of which the most important is the milk-in-schools scheme. These provisions expire in September 1936. It is not yet possible to introduce a permanent Act for the following reasons.3. Under Schedule A of the Ottawa Agreements we undertook not to impose quantitative regulation or duties on imports of dairy produce from the Dominions for three years from August 1932. Though we thus recovered freedom to impose quantitative regulation and duties on such imports as from last August, there is a further provision of Schedule A of the Ottawa Agreements that in the event of duties being imposed, the existing preferential margin must be maintained. A dutjr on Dominion imports would, therefore, have to be accompanied by a corresponding increase in the existing duty on foreign imports. We have under-taken, however, in the Trade Agreements with Denmark and a number of other countries, the latest of which expires on the 31st December, 1936, not to increase existing duties on butter.4. The following statement of the Government position on dairy products (which had been agreed between the Treasury, the Foreign Office, the Dominions Office, the Board of Trade, the Scottish Office and the Ministry of Agriculture) was made in the House of Commons on the 25th July, 1935 :-- &quot; The position of the home industry is safeguarded for the present by the provisions of Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Milk Act, 1934, under which Milk Marketing Boards are guaranteed, by means of Exchequer advances, standard minimum prices for milk sold, or used, for manufacturing purposes. The Government have in mind, however, the fact that these provisions expire at the end of March next, and they propose to review fully the dairy produce situation before that date in the light of our obligations under trade agreements and of the recommendations of the Reorganisation Commission for Milk for Great Britain, whose report, it is hoped, will be available before the end of the year. [12637]
I am, however, in a position to indicate generally the policy of the Government with regard to the problem created by butter and cheese imports. The Government are of opinion that, if conditions should warrant continued assistance to the home industry, such assistance could best be afforded by a system of duties or levies. The possibility cannot be excluded that, in addition, some regulation of the market may be desirable in the general interest of producers in certain cases or at particular times, but, as in the case of meat, the Government would not regard as a satisfactory permanent arrangement a system under which the responsibility for the regulation of the market would rest on them alone. In acordance with the Ottawa Agree-ments, the incidence of any duty or levy upon foreign and Empire supplies respectively would be so adjusted as to maintain the existing preferential margin.The position with regard to milk powder and condensed milk (skimmed and whole) will receive separate consideration. An application for additional duties on foreign imports of these commodities has been sub-mitted to the Import Duties Advisory Committee by home interests. Future policy with regard to both foreign and Dominion imports will be considered when the Report of the Import Duties Advisory Committee on that appli-cation is received.&quot;5. Since that date the General Election has intervened. It is also now -certain that the report of the Great Britain Milk Reorganisation Commission will not be available for some months possibly not before May. When the report is issued, both the industry and the Government will need time to consider the recommendations. If it is eventually decided that continued assistance to the home industry is warranted, and that this should be afforded, as previously contemplated, by a system of duties or levies, it seems unlikely that the necessary legislation could be framed and passed in time to bring a long-term policy into operation this year.   In the meantime, the present Act would have lapsed.6. We recommend accordingly that authority should be given for the intro-duction of a short Bill extending the main provisions of the Milk Act, 1934, until [31st March,] 1937.7. Section 5 of the 1934 Act makes provision for conditional repayment by Milk Marketing Boards of the Exchequer advances in the event of the &quot; cheese-milk price rising above a specified figure during the two years beginning the 1st April, 1936. We recommend that this provision should be allowed to run concurrently with the proposed extension of the period during which advances may be made, and that the period of conditional repayment should itself be extended by a further [twelve months].8. There is no present need to provide for an extension of the provisions of Section 9 for improving the quality of the milk supply since the payments authorised under that Section can, under the present Act, be made over a period of four consecutive years.9. The question whether provision should be made for further payments to the Government of Northern Ireland in respect of milk used for manufacture (Section 6) during the period of the proposed extension, is receiving the consideration of the Treasury.10. It is estimated that the cost of the proposed extension until the :31st March, 1937, which will be determined by the gallonage of milk used for manufacture and the prevailing cheese-milk price, will be approximately  1,850,000, excluding any provision which may be made for pa3rments to the Government of Northern Ireland ( 200,000 per annum under the existing Act). Of this sum  1,600,000 will represent advances which will be contingently repayable under the provisions of Section 5. Under Section 11  1,000,000 was provided for publicity schemes (milk-in-schools, &amp;c.) for two years. An extension of six months (October 1936-March 1937) would under this heading involve the provision of a further  250,000.11. A minor amendment of Section 2 (under which Ministers certify appropriate manufacturing milk prices &quot; for milk used by Milk Marketing Boards themselves for manufacturing purposes) will be necessary in order to overcome difficulties which have arisen in securing uniformity between the certified prices in England and in Scotland.
January 24, 1936.12.   To sum up (i) The Milk Act, 1934, made provision (1) designed to encourage a greater consumption of liquid milk; (2) for securing an improvement in the qualitjr of the milk supply; and (3) for safeguarding the prices received b)^ the home producer for milk sold for manufacture into dairy products. These provisions were limited in time owing to the great desirability of keeping the position closely under review.(ii) The most important of these provisions cease on the 31st March, 1936. In view of the Ottawa and foreign trade agreements and the decision not to impose quantitative regulation on the Dominions, we shall probably not be able to afford alternative protection to the industry before 1937.(iii) Authority is therefore sought for the introduction of legislation (a) to continue the Exchequer advances under Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the MilkAct, 1934, for a further [twelve months] ; (&amp;) to continue Exchequer assistance on existing lines for the Milk-in-schools and other publicity schemes (Section 11) up to [31st March], 1937; (c) to extend the provisions for contingent repayment of Exchequer advances(Section 5) for a further [twelve months].(iv) The amount which will be required for further advances under Sections 1, 2 and 3 (which will be subject to the provisions for contingent repay-ment under Section 5) is estimated to be  1,600,000, apart from any provision which may be made for payments to the Government of Northern Ireland. The amount required for the proposed further Exchequer assistance under Section 11 will be  250,000.W. E. E. G. P. C.
