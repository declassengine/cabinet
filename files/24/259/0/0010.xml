This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet January, 1936SECRETCopy No.    5 4CP. 10 (36)THE CABINETTHE ITALIAN SITUATION IN EAST africa memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR I circulate the subjoined note for the information of my colleagues.The War Office,17th January, 1936 D.C.Northern Front-The initial object of the Italians in their advance from Eritrea was to inflict a crushing defeat on the Ethiopians in the hope that this would lead to the disintegration of the Ethiopian forces and thus facilitate the occupation of at least the whole of the province of Tigre during the first campaigning season. The failure to achieve this object owing to the refusal of the Ethiopians to stand and fight a pitched battle has undoubtedly been a great and disconcerting surprise to the Italians. It has, moreover, upset their plans and, instead of only having to follow up a defeated and demoralized enemy, they have been drawn on into very difficult country against increasingly strong opposition.It may also be assumed that the failure of air bombardment to produce a decisive effect on the moral of the Ethiopians has been a further surprise and disappointment to the Italians.The failure to clear and occupy the Tembien plateau has left a dangerous re-entrant on the right of the Italian front threatening the main lines of communication via Adigrat to Macalle and delaying a further advance : it has also prevented the opening of a much needed second line of communication via Adua to Macalle. Before a further advance on a large scale is possible, it will be necessary to secure the Tembien plateau and improve the line of communication.The Italians state that good &quot;all-weather &quot; roads have now been constructed up to the southern frontier of Eritrea, but beyond this frontier into the Tigre there are for the most part only &quot;fair-weather&quot; roads hastily constructed and little better than levelled tracks : these, even in the dry season, have not stood the strain of the constant and heavy traffic to which they are subjected, and have suffered serious damage as a result of the recent rains. Before the really wet season sets in in April, it will be necessary to convert these &quot; fair-weather &quot; roads into permanent ones with sound foundations and adequate bridges and culverts. Work began early in December on the main lines of communication via Adigrat to Macalle on an asphalt &quot; all-weather &quot; road which it is hoped to complete to Edaga Hamus, a distance of 25 miles from the frontier of Eritrea, by the end of January, and to Macalle, a further 80 miles, by the end of March. The rate of progress of a similar road on the north-west frontier of India is 12 miles a month and it would seem, therefore, that the Italian estimate of progress beyond Edaga Hamus is very optimistic and that they may have great difficulty in maintaining their forces as far forward as Macalle during the rains.
It is also proposed to construct an &quot; all-weather &quot; road from the frontier of Eritrea via Adua to Aksum by the end of March.In spite of the hardships of fighting in such country as the Tigre with inadequate lines of communication and poor administrative arrangements, the moral and health of the Italian troops have so far been good. But it seems that no steps are being taken to provide in the forward areas any shelter other than tents during the rains, which last for about five months from April and are heavy and continuous : this is bound to have a very adverse effect upon the health and moral of the troops.The Italian forces now on the northern front consist of:  four white divisions each of 18,000 men,five black shirt (national militia) divisions each of 12,000 men, two native divisions each of 18,000 men.The total strength of the above, including corps troops, is about 240,000.A further two white divisions are en route from Italy and believed to be destined for Eritrea, though it is not apparent how these additional forces can be usefully employed on the northern front in view of the existing administrative difficulties and the inadequacy of communications.Southern Front. On the southern front the Italians have done practically nothing by way of active operations since their advance was checked at Ananle on 11th November. This inactivity is believed to be due partly to disaffection among the Italian Somali troops, and partly to the threat by Ras Dasta&apos;s force against the left rear of the Italians, which has caused General Graziani to concentrate the bulk of his white troops in the valley of the Juba.If it were intended to carry out large scale operations on this front for the purpose of occupying the province of Harar and advancing as far as the Jibuti Addis Ababa railway, a distance of some 300 miles from the approximate frontier of Italian Somaliland, considerably larger forces than those now employed in this theatre would be required and also the construction of roads fit for heavy and continuous lorry traffic : such roads have not yet been begun.The Italian forces now on the southern front consist of : one white regular division of 18,000 men,one black shirt (national militia) division of 12,000 men,one native division of 18,000 men.The total strength of the above, including corps troops and irregulars, is about 65,000.Conclusion. Owing to the check on the Ternbien plateau and the delay in starting construction of weather-proof lines of communication, it now seems improbable that the Italians on the northern front will be able to advance much further, or secure a decisive success, before the opening of the wet season in April puts a stop to active operations for a period of about five months. This long period, of inactivity may be expected to effect adversely the efficiency of the troops and, tailing adequate protection from the weather, their health and moral are bound to suffer severely.The British Military Attache in Rome has been informed that important operations are planned for rhe end of January. These might be an advance from Assab either towards the Jibuti Addis Ababa railway, or towards Dessye combined with an advance on the Italian right along the Sudan frontier in order to outflank resistance in the centre ; but the water-logged condition of the Hawash valley due to the recent rains probably precludes an Italian advance from Assab by this line against the railway. It is even possible that Marshal Badoglio may try to push forward from Macalle to secure the important pass of Amba Alagi about 40 miles to the south. This would involve an advance through difficult country well suited to the Ethiopian defence and, unless the Tembien had previously been cleared, would increase the danger of the Ethiopian threat to, his right flank. None of these operations is, however, likely to achieve important results before April, and short of killing the Emperor o  Ethiopia or engaging in large scale gas warfare from the air, it is difficult to foresee what other major success the Italians can now hope to achieve.
(b36/8)   60   1/36   W.O.V.   9197The removal of the Emperor would be likely to lead to the disintegration of the Ethiopian forces and would probably facilitate a settlement sufficiently satisfactory to the Italians to save Mussolini&apos;s prestige.Aerial gas warfare, particularly the spraying of mustard gas, would have a very serious effect upon the Ethiopians who have no means of protection ; possibly the recent and violent Italian propaganda against Ethiopian atrocities is an indication that the Italians intend to try this.But in any case it is clear that the Italians will have to face a long and difficult task, if they are to achieve their aims in Ethiopia : and the probability is that Signor Mussolini will be found to have relied too much upon the regenerating effect of Fascism and his own influence to maintain the determination and moral of the nation in face of this long drawn test of endurance, combined with the increasing deterioration in the -economic situation of Italy.
