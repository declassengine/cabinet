THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT17Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1936.SECRET.Copy No. 38CP. 3 (36).CABINET.PALESTINE.Arab Grievances.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE as Appendices to this memorandum A memorandum submitted jointly by five Arab political parties in Palestine to the High Commissioner setting out their grievances against His Majesty&apos;s Government and their demands for measures to be taken to safeguard the interests of the Arab community.   (Appendix I.)Three despatches in which Sir Arthur Wauchope comments on the general situation in Palestine and on the demands made by the Arabs in their memorandum.   (Appendices II, III and IV.)At the interview on the 25th November, 1935, when the Arab leaders submitted their memorandum, they informed the High Commissioner that, unless they received a reply to their memorandum which could be generally regarded as giving satisfaction to their requests, they would lose all influence with their followers, extreme and irresponsible counsels would prevail and the political situation would rapidly deteriorate. The High Commissioner has himself emphasized the importance of receiving at the earliest possible moment such a reply as will enable him to give some satisfaction to the Arab leaders, as he thinks that they are right in saying that otherwise they will lose such influence as they now possess, and that the possibility will then disappear of alleviating the present situation by means of the measures which the High Commissioner recommends should be taken.2. The leaders of the Arab parties have arranged to meet again on the 15th January, and, unless they can be sufficiently reassured as to the attitude and intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the High Commissioner considers that there is every indication that trouble will occur at some time after the date of that meeting. Though he does not at present fear riots on a large scale, Sir Arthur Wauchope thinks it right to say that in the present state of tension untoward incidents might cause considerable disturbances.3. The principal demands made by the Arab leaders in their memorandum fall under three heads.(a) &quot; The establishment of a democratic government in the country in accordance with the terms of the Covenant of the League of Nations and in execution of the second fart of Article 2 of the Palestine Mandate.&quot;4.   As to this, I am circulating to the Cabinet a separate memorandum dealing with the proposals for setting up a Legislative Council in Palestine.
(b) That Jewish immigration should be stopped immediately.5. Clearly no such demand can be entertained, but it is a fact that the economic future of Palestine is becoming more and more obscure and the difficulty of forecasting the consequences of the remarkable increase in recent years in Jewish immigration is enhanced by the&apos;present uncertainty as regards the international situation. In Sir Arthur Wauchope&apos;s opinion, it is necessary on economic grounds alone that there should be some slowing down in the pace of Jewish immigration, which has risen from about 30,000 in 1933 to about 60,000 in 1935. The High Commissioner has accordingly felt it necessary to aim at a total immigration for 1936 of about 44,000, although this figure may, in his opinion, well prove too high if even a small economic set-back should occur. He has, in consequence, decided to authorize a labour schedule (i.e., for wage-earners) for the current half-year ending the 31st March next of 3,250 immigration certificates. Application by the Jewish Agency for this schedule had been considerably clewed owing to the temporary economic dislocation and unemployment arising from the bank panic last autumn but 1,000 certificates on account of this schedule were issued in advance during November last.6. The High Commissioner also proposes to impose certain restrictions on the immigration of dependants in order to check the inflow of unselected and unskilled Immigrants, who would be among the first to suffer unemployment in the event of any economic set-back.7. A third measure which Sir Arthur Wauchope has in mind is to increase from  1,000 to  2,000 the qualifying capital, the possession of which enables an immigrant to enter the country without any quota restriction. Sir Arthur Wauchope considers that, owing to the abnormally high cost of land and the rise in rents and labour charges, an immigrant cannot now7 count upon an assured prospect of permanent establishment in the country with so small a capital as  1,000. On this point I informed him by telegraph on the 2nd January that I approved of his discussing the proposal with the local representatives of the Jewish Agency, and that while I was disposed to agree with his proposal, I should prefer not to take any final decision pending receipt of a further report from him after his discussion with representatives of the Agency.ic) The prohibition- by law of the transfer of Arab lands to Jews.8. Leaving aside the political motives which have led to this demand, the High Commissioner, who has been feeling anxiety on the subject for some time past, has reached the conclusion that an economic situation is rapidly being created by the progressive transfer of agricultural land from Arab to Jewish hands, which, if no remedy is applied, will lead to very undesirable consequences.9. Measures have already been taken to prevent agricultural tenants from being evicted when the estates of which their holdings form a part change ownership. There are, however, now strong indications that the Jews are to an increasing extent buying land in comparatively small plots from owners who cultivate their own land. The Arab agriculturist is notoriously improvident and tends, after squandering the purchase money of his land, to seek employment in the towns. Under present economic conditions no serious ill-effects of this tendency are yet visible, but, unless there should be some fundamental change of Jewish policy, the process of land purchase.se may be expected to continue, if it is not checked, until practically the whole of the agricultural&apos; land of the country which it is profitable for the Jews to bu)r has passed into Jewish hands, with the exception of the citrus estates of relatively large Arab landowners, with the result that the urban population will be increased by many thousands of Arabs seeking employment as wage-earners who would constitute a serious social and economic problem in the event of any considerable check to the possibly abnormal prosperity which the country is at present enjoying.10. The High Commissioner urges that it is the duty of Government under the Mandate to take some positive action which will have the effect of protecting the small Arab landowner, and he recommends that he should be authorised to
.enact legislation to that end. He proposes that this legislation should not apply to-(a) The Beersheba Sub-District, where land is comparatively plentiful andthe population comparatively scanty;(b) Urban(c) Land already planted with citrus.But as regards the rest of Palestine he proposes that no landowner should be permitted to sell any of his land unless he retains a minimum area sufficient to afford him and his family a means of subsistence. This minimum area would be inalienable and would revert to Government should the owner-occupier for any reason desert his holding and cease to cultivate it.11. Information is not yet available as to the extent to which such a restric-tion would limit the further purchase of agricultural land by the Jews, as the minimum subsistence area will naturally vary in extent from one locality to another and the details of the scheme have yet to be worked out. It would,, however, I think, be wise to assume that the imposition of such a restriction would result in withholding from the market a very considerable proportion of agricultural land at present in Arab ownership.12. In any event the High Commissioner&apos;s proposals will be strongly attacked by the Jews as imposing an artificial check upon the development of the Jewish National Home, and it may even be contended that to do so would be a violation of the terms of the letter written to Dr. &quot;Weizmann by Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, as Prime Minister, on the 13th February, 1931. Apart, however,, from the fact that important areas of Palestine would be expressly excepted from the scope of the proposed legislation, it must be borne in mind that Mr. Ramsay MacDonald&apos;s assurances were given with specific reference to the policy of land settlement and development referred to in the White Paper of October 1930. In fact, the whole letter is described in the opening paragraph as &quot; the authoritative interpretation of the White Paper on the matters with which this letter deals.&quot; In the relevant paragraphs of his letter Mr. Ramsay MacDonald was concerned to reassure the Jews on one special point, viz., that such a policy of land settle-ment would not be used as an excuse for imposing for an ulterior purpose restrictions upon land transactions which would be more than what was required for the purposes of carrying out that policy. His assurances could not be interpreted as debarring His Majesty&apos;s Government indefinitely from taking any action which, even if no development or resettlement were in view, might be considered necessary in the general interests of Palestine at some future date and in the face of developments which had not then assumed any serious prominence..13. It will be observed that the High Commissioners proposal introduces an entirely new principle. The legislation which has been enacted to protect tenants can be justified by the practice at home; whereas legislation to protect owners against themselves is an entire innovation. But the answer given by Sir Arthur Wauchope is that the Mandate demands that he should protect the interests of all sections of the community, and he believes that this proposal is necessary in order to do so.(Initialled) J. H. T.Colonial Office, Downing Street, January 10, 1936.
APPENDIX I.Translation of the Arab Memorandum handed to the High Commissioner forPalestine on November 25, 1935.His Excellency the High Commissioner, Government Offices, Jerusalem.Your Excellency,THE British Government announced recently, through its Representative at the League of Nations, that it was prepared to use all the forces at its disposal in order to uphold the Covenant of the League.of Nations. It has expressd its eagerness before the public opinion to protect the independence of Abyssinia and its preparedness to defend that independence, in furtherance of the cause of right and justice, as an act of support to weak nations which have been the object of aggression. It even expressed its willingness to embark, if necessary, on any adventure in defence of the principles of humanity which are represented in the League of Nations.But in Palestine, the contrary has been the case. Plere the British Govern-ment disregarded the pledges which were made to the Arabs, did not take the Covenant of the League of Nations into account and overlooked the principles of humanity which are based on justice and equity. It exceeds every limit in depriving the Arabs of Palestine of the right of independence and trespasses upon their economical and administrative rights in order to facilitate the establishment of a National Home for the Jews.It will be recalled that the British Government undertook in 1915, through its Representative, Sir Henry McMahon, to recognize and support the independence of Arab countries, including Palestine, within the limits which were laid down at the time by the late King (then Sherif) Hussain, in his capacity as representative of the Arabs, in consideration for the heavy blood which was shed by the Arabs, including Palestinian Arabs, during the Great War on the side of the Allies.The Great War did not come to an end except after the Allies have acknow-ledged for all nations the principle of self-determination as wras announced recently by His Majest)r&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs before the League of Nations. In the case of Palestine, however, Great Britain not only failed to apply this principle but completely ignored it in furtherance of the establishment of the National Home for the Jews.Even if we disregard all these factors and take into consideration the Covenant of the League of Nations, for the maintenance of which His Majesty&apos;s Government has expressed its preparedness to make every sacrifice, it will appear, beyond doubt, that as regards Palestine, His Majesty&apos;s Government has dishonestly infringed that Covenant. Article 22 of the Covenant recognized the independence of such countries which formerly belonged to the Turkish Empire subject to a temporary Mandate in the form of advice and assistance to be rendered by the Mandatory until such time as these countries, within which Palestine wTas included, are able to stand alone. The British Government, however, failed to apply this express provision, on the ground that it was inconsistent with the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which is, in itself, repugnant to the Article of the Covenant quoted above. That Declaration should have been abrogated by virtue of Article 19 of the Covenant, under which members of the League severally accepted the Covenant as abrogating all obligations or under-standings inter se which are inconsistent with its terms. On the contrary, the British Government has gone as far as to trespass on the rights of the Arabs which were fully safeguarded, both in the Balfour Declaration and in the Mandate and which were interpreted by  the Mandatory  Power,  through
Sir Herbert Samuel, the ardent Zionist, in its Report on the Administration of Palestine for 1920-21 in the following terms : &apos;&apos; The measures to foster the well-being of the Arabs should be precisely those which we should adopt in Palestine if there were no Zionist question and if there had been no Balfour Declaration.&quot;He also added : &quot;In a word, the degree to which Jewish national aspiration can be fulfilled in Palestine is conditioned by the rights of the present inhabitants.&quot;Taking the present form of Government which exists in Palestine, it will be found that it consists of a British Government which is under the Mandate of another British Government in London. There does not exist in the country -any form of independence of whatever nature, the establishment of which is required by the Covenant of the League of Nations and the terms of the Balfour Declaration which restrain the British Government, in the application of the Declaration, from doing anything which may prejudice the rights of the Arabs ,and from taking any step which may be inconsistent with their interest.For the last eighteen years the Arabs have been demanding a fair and equitable treatment. They entertained the hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government will ultimately realize the futility of its policy and its consequences and will abandon such policy. But all these hopes were frustrated as this wrong policy is still applied, injustice is still meted out to the people and justice and equity are persistently ignored or violated. The present form of Government may serve as the best example. After all this long period that has already passed, the inhabitants of the country have no effective say in the Administration which is maintained, as it does by the bayonets of the Mandatory Government, irrespective of the will of the people and in a manner inconsistent with their interests. In these circumstances, while not recognizing the Mandate which was imposed upon us, we demand the establishment of a democratic Government in the country in accordance with the terms of the Covenant of the League of Nations and in execution of the second part of Article 2 of the Palestine Mandate.Lands.Sir John Hope Simpson, the British Expert, who was delegated by the British Government in 1930 to investigate into Immigration, Land Settlement and Development, and whose views were corroborated by Mr. Lewis French in his report for 1931, calculated the lot-viable for an Arab family at 130 dunums. He found out that the cultivable land which was in possession of the Arabs at the time (i.e., 1930) would not afford an average lot in excess of 90 dunums. Since that time, the number of the Arab population has.increased by not less than 150,000 and the area of land in possession of the Arabs decreased, through acquisition by the Jews, by not less than 600,000; thus the area of the average holding of an Arab family was greatly reduced.As the best illustration of the precarious position of the Arabs, notwith-rstanding the insufficiency of the land in their possession, the letter whic Mr. Hankin, a Jewish Land Expert and agent of the Palestine Land Develop-ment Company, addressed to Mr. French in July 1930 may be quoted.  Mr. Hankin -admitted this fact in the following terms :  - - - . but we have possibility of acquiring 100,000 dunums without having to make any settlement for the tenants, since the acquisition of such an area will not cause harm to anybody and will not oust anybody from his land; only after this area has been acquired we shall have to see to a proper settlement for the tenants.....&quot;Since that express admission was made, an additional area of 600,000 dunums was acquired by the Jews. It will be seen that taking the admission of the Jews themselves Government is under a duty to stop any further transfer of lands from the Arabs to Jews.Any person who studies the conditions of Palestine and the speedy develop ments which are taking place whereby the Arabs are continually dispossessed of their land and Arab villages supplanted by Jewish Settlements (the names of some of which were published at occasions&apos; in the Palestine Gazette, while the names of others were deliberately not published) will come to the conclusion that
the destiny of the Arab people of Palestine, as a whole, would not be dissimilar to that of the inhabitants of these villages who were dispossessed of their land and whose villages were supplanted by Jewish Settlements in which the Arabs have no traces.The acquisition of such large areas of land by Jews and the eviction of the people therefrom does not only prejudicially affect the owners of the lands who are displaced; it also destructively&apos; affects the neighbouring Arab towns which, before the eviction of the inhabitants of the villages, are usually flourishing and exchange with the neighbouring villagers the sale of all kinds of goods, com-modities and trade and live in co-operation with one another. Nazareth may be quoted as an example. Most of the places of business in this town were closed and its trade became stagnant as soon as the Jews acquired the plain of Esdraelon and its villages, evicted the Arab inhabitants therefrom and estab-lished for themselves special markets from which the Arabs derive no benefit.It is the practice of Jewish organizations to create the lands which they acquire as a trust to be held as the inalienable property of the Jewish people. They impose on the cultivator a condition not to employ on the land but Jewish labour, failing which he will be liable to-various penalties. These facts were confirmed, by evidence, by Sir John Hope Simpson in his Report and admitted by the Jewish Agency.That this is the case is shown by paragraph 19 of the White Paper, 1930,. which reads, in part:  &quot; . . . . Moreover, the effect of Jewish colonization on the existing-population is very intimately affected by the conditions on which the various Jewish bodies hold, utilize and lease their land: It is provided by the Constitution of the Enlarged Jewish Agency, signed at Zurich on the 14th August, 1929 (Article 3 (d) and (e)), that the land acquired shall be held as the &apos; inalienable property of the Jewish people,&apos; and that in &apos; all the works or undertakings carried out or furthered by the Agency, it shall be deemed to be a matter of principle that Jewish labour shall be employed.&apos; Moreover, by Article 23 of the draft lease, which it is proposed to execute in respect of all holdings granted by the Jewish National Fund, the lessee undertakes to execute all works connected with the cultivation of the holdings only with Jewish labour.&quot;Under the circumstances described above, every plot of land in Palestine which is transferred to Jewish bodies is definitely extra-territorialized. It ceases-to be land from which the Arab can gain any advantage either now or at any time in the future, nor can he ever hope to cultivate it, but he is deprived for ever from employment on that land and from purchasing or acquiring it at any time. It follows, therefore, that if alienation of Arab lands continues and the Jews were able to acquire the largest part or all of the lands of Palestine, that will definitely mean that Palestine, as a whole, would be alienated for ever and the Arab people will not be able, under the stringent conditions laid down by Jewish bodies, either to reacquire any part of such land or to derive any advantage therefrom through employment or otherwise.It will appear from the above that the position of the Arabs in Palestine,, from the land point of view, is very precarious and threatened with danger. Any person who carefully studies this situation will necessarily come to the conclusion that the question of land in Palestine is governed by an oppressive and premeditated policy which will result, sooner or later, in the expropriation of the Arabs from their lands, in their dispersion, and in the undermining of their national structure in order to instal on their ruins a national home for the Jews. It is a matter of surprise that Government should have failed to enforce the recommendations of the Commissions of Enquiry and British experts who^ were delegated by the Mandatory Government to enquire into the land problem, although they have all shown, at least implicitly, that the Arabs were facing such a danger. Failure of Government to enforce these recommendations shows that it follows a laid down policy which is.calculated to annihilate the Arabs and to expropriate them, for ever, from their country.This situation prompts us to strongly assert the demand which has been repeatedly made that a law be issued prohibiting the transfer of Arab lands to Jews, and that a further law be made, similar to the Five Feddans Law of Egypt, which should also be made applicable to transactions between Arabs themselves..
Immigration.The British Government declared its intention, in the White Paper of 1922, to regulate immigration so that (i) Immigration will not exceed the economic absorptive capacity of thecountry.(ii) Immigrants will not become a burden on the country as a whole.(iii) Immigrants will not deprive any of the existing population of his employment.The number of immigrants who entered Palestine in that year (i.e., 1922) amounted to 6,341, but by 1925 their number reached the high figure of 33,000, on the assumption that such number of immigrants was not in excess of the economic capacity of the country. But the crisis which prevailed in the country in 1926 and the following years has shown that this assumption was unfounded. Sir John Campbell, an acknowledged authority on economics, who was delegated by the Zionist organization to report on the economic conditions in Palestine, stated in his report that the crisis of 1927 and 1928 was due &quot; to the fact that immigrants have come into Palestine in excess of the economic absorptive power of the country.&quot; Again, in the Annual Report on the Administration of Palestine for 1928, it was stated that- &quot; Palestine still suffered .... from the repercussions of the uneconomic immigration of 1925.....&quot;Referring to the period between 1922-29, during which period the annual average of Jewish immigrants was 8,000 only, the Parliamentary Commission of Enquiry of 1929 confirmed in its report that &quot; . . . . there is incontestable evidence that in the matter of immigra-tion, there has been a serious departure . . . -. from the doctrine accepted .... in 1922, that immigration should be regulated by the economic capacity of the country to absorb new arrivals.&quot;In its recommendations the Commission said &quot; Immigration should be reviewed with the object of preventing a repetition of the excessive immigration of 1925 and 1926.&quot;But notwithstanding all this evidence, which proves beyond any doubt the futility of the policy which was adopted during that period during which the average number of Jewish immigrants was not more than 8,000 per year, the Palestine Government, acting again under the assumption that the economic capacity of the country can absorb new immigrants, opened the gates of the country, before the immigrants, to the extent that the number of immigrants who were admitted last year was 42,359, exclusive of the illicit immigrants, which -according to the statement made by His Excellency the High Commissioner in .a speech which he made at Nablus, in 1933, is not much less than that of legal immigrants. The admission of such a large number of immigrants will not only place the country in a difficult position as a result of the wrongful policy of Government, but is inconsistent with rules (i) and (ii), quoted above, which were laid down by the British Government in 1922 for the purpose of regulating immigration.Furthermore, the attitude taken by Jewish immigrants in compelling Arab labourers through their pickets and organizations to leave their employment in Jewish Settlements and places is sufficient to show that such immigration has resulted in the violation of rule (ii) referred to above.This immigration is not only in contravention of the doctrines laid down in the White Paper of 1922, but is also inconsistent with Article 6 of the Mandate, which imposes that the &apos;&apos; administration of Palestine, while ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced, shall facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions.&quot; This provision means that not only the economic and administrative rights of the original inhabitants should not be prejudiced, but also their general position as constituting the overwhelming majority of the population. Indeed, Government statistics show that this &quot; Arab majority &quot; is being continually affected by the increase of Jewish immigration, and, should immigration be not stopped, it will disappear altogether.
The difficulty of the present position and the bad consequences which may ensue in future may be illustrated by the statement contained in the Report on. the Census of Palestine, 1931. This is a scientific and economic fact which has no bearing on politics.  It was stated in that Report that-&apos;&apos; Without these proportionate increases in imported invisible value (foreign contributions) and in internal production of special supplies, surplus-to the internal requirements of the country, and so available for sale abroad, it is difficult to see how the rate of increase of subsistence for the population is to keep pace with the growth of the population.&quot; It is, therefore, of interest to imagine Palestine as maintaining a population at its present rates of increase, but linked to the world only by its small export trade and by its large imports of value .... before the population overtakes its means of subsistence.&quot;It may be observed in this, connection that^the- Policy which has been applied by Government in recent years with regard to immigration is calculated to accelerate the prevalence of such a difficult situation.There is another proof which shows the leniency of Government and its-desire to overcrowd the country with Jewish immigrants in order to enable them to become the majority of the population. Government has failed, until now, to take any action with regard to the 6,000 Jews who entered the country in connection with the Macabiad, and, although they delivered their passports to Government and paid the necessary deposits, they remained in the country and failed to leave it until now. We understand that the passports of these persons are still in the Departments of Police and Immigration, who appear to have failed to discover their ^countries of origin and to repatriate them.In these circumstances, we demand (1) That Jewish immigration be immediately stopped, and that a committee be formed of the competent elements to study the absorptive capacity of the country and to lay down a principle for immigration, as is the case in most countries of the world.(2) That a law be made requiring every lawful resident in Palestine to hold an identity card to be issued by Government, and to produce such card on demand by any officer of Government in order to ascertain whether or not he was lawfully admitted to Palestine.(3) That effective immediate investigations be made into the question of immigrants who illicitly entered the country or who entered on valid endorsements for a limited period, but remained in the country.Effect of Immigration on Public Morality.This immigration has enabled vagabonds and outcasts to enter Palestine, the Holy Land, the land of peace and the birthplace of religions, and to spread in this country their strange doctrines and destructive practices in a manner which reflects on the sanctity of this country. This country is not used to such frightful incidents which daily emanate from Jewish centres, such as the organized acts of brigandage, fraud and forgery, in which some Jewish officers either take a direct part or are responsible for their commission or concealment. There is no doubt that Your Excellency shares our view that this immigration has enabled Communists and Bolsheviks to propagate and disseminate their doctrines not only in Palestine, but to use Palestine as a centre for their activities amongst the Arabs in all parts of the Near East. The manner in which the settlers live in some of the Jewish settlements such as Ain Harod and other settlements is a clear indication that the Jews, headed by the Socialist Party, which has overpowered all the other Jewish Parties, intend, at the end, to overflow this country with subversive doctrines which are inconsistent with religious principles and doctrines of morality.We take this opportunity to draw Your Excellency&apos;s attention to that strange spirit which the Jews propagate amongst the population, and in which they encourage the violation of the law, the defeat of public authorities and the escape of the requirements of the law. The best example which would prove this view is the manner in which they secure the illegal admission of immigrants and there-after oppose the Police Authorities, whenever they seek the arrest of such immigrants.     Individuals as well as bodies co-operate in concealing all such
immigrants, as was the case with those persons who entered Palestine as travellers-in connection with the Macabiad, which took place at the beginning of this year, and remained in the country, as was admitted by the Department of Immigration. We also wish to refer, on this occasion, to the smuggling of arms and ammunition by Jews which has taken place for some time and which has recently been carried out on a larger scale, challenging as they did the authority of Government and threatening the lives of the Arabs.In order that a check be put to such activities, we persistently demand that Government should apply the Ordinance which it enacted to meet such cases, such as the Criminal Law (Seditious Offences) Ordinance and the Prevention of Crimes Ordinance, the application of which has hitherto been restricted to the Arabs in unjustifiable cases.Conclusion.The Arabs have entertained great hopes when His Excellency Sir Arthur Grenfell Wauchope was appointed as Pligh Commissioner about four years ago. They expected that His Excellency will embark on the application of the reports and recommendations of the various Commissions of Enquiry without any discrimination and in such an equitable manner as may be dictated by his military honour. Unfortunately, their hopes were not realised, for during all these four years of his office, His Excellency continually spoke of self-government, but never fulfilled anything. He opened the gates of the country before Jewish immigra-tion, utterly ignoring the previous experience of the Government and its painful consequences. He facilitated, during that period, the admission of a large number of Jewish immigrants, which exceeds the number which was admitted by his predecessors during fourteen years, and enabled the Jews, during his short time of office, to acquire land which is larger in area than the land acquired by them since the British Occupation, and in so doing he ignored the recommenda-tions of commissions and experts on these matters.For that reason, we feel ourselves compelled, in our capacity as representa-tives of the various Arab Parties which represent the Palestine Arab Nation, to express our deepest regret at the frustration of the hopes which we entertained and the non-realization of our expectations and hopes which we had in His Excellency, and at the loss of the confidence of the Arabs who have reached a state of despondency through Your Excellency&apos;s policy, although they were inclined to co-operate with you in such a manner as will protect all their rights had they seen a keen desire towards that end on Your Excellency&apos;s part.(Signed)      ABDULLATIF SALAH,    (Signed)      JAMAL HUSSEINI,(Signed)MOHAMMAD ISHAQWith highest respects.)

APPENDIX II.Secret Despatch from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated December 7, 1935.^(Secret.)Reference No. CF/409 / 35.Sir, December 7, 1935.I HAVE the honour to enclose for your consideration a memorandum* -signed by Ragheb Nashashibi, President, The National Defence Party, Mohammad Ishaq Budeiri, on behalf of the Islah Party, Jamal Husseini, President, Palestine Arab Party, Abdullatif Salah, President, National Block, and Yacoub Ghussain, President, Executive Cpmmitfc.ee, Arab Youngmen Congress.2. This memorandum was presented to me at the interview which I granted these gentlemen at their request on the 25th November, shortly after my return to Palestine. I enclose also a recordt of the interview. I have jdealt fully in my despatch, Secret, &quot;A,&quot; of the 7th December,! with the political situation which forms the background of the memorandum. I have also indicated the lines of a reply to the three principal demands in the memorandum. I will not, therefore, recapitulate them here. But I emphasise the importance of receiving from you at the earliest moment possible such a reply as will enable me to give some satisfaction to the Arab leaders, since I think they are right in saying that otherwise they will lose such influence as they now possess and that the possibility of alleviating the present situation by means of the moderate measures suggested by me will disappear.3. As regards the standing of the gentlemen who have signed the niemo-randum enclosed with, this despatch, Ragheb Bey Nashashibi and Jamal Eff. Husseini are well knoAvn to the Colonial Office. These two gentlemen are repre-sentative of two important sections of political opinion. But the five signatories represent the five active Arab political parties and they are generally represen-tative of informed Arab political opinion in Palestine. It is unlikely that their present association together for a common purpose will last long. I mention this point particularly because, when I discussed the Legislative Council with a number of individuals in the early part of this year, I emphasised the necessity of creating an Arab committee which could be regarded as representing the collective opinions of the community, so that there might be some single Arab body with which I could discuss the proposals for a Legislative Council. - The present situation has temporarily brought into existence such a body, though with other motives and for other purposes. This situation is unlikely to last long and may not recur. I feel, therefore, that the present opportunity should not be missed since there appears to be a chance of effecting a detente in the situation. The alternative is an increasing tenseness in the situation punctuated by sporadic disturbances of the peace.I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. G. WAUCHOPE,Hiah Commissioner for Palestine.* Enclosure 1 (printed as Appendix I). f Enclosure II (not printed). t Printed as Appendix III.
APPENDIX III.Secret Despatch from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated December 7, 1935.(Secret.   A.)Reference No. CF/409/35.Sir, December 7, 1935.IN my telegram to the Secretary of State of the 15th November dealing with the possible reduction in strength of the British garrison in Palestine, I stated that there had been signs during the last few months that the general&apos; feeling among Arabs had become definitely more hostile to Government and that the leaders spoke in public of the necessity for Arabs to take what they termed firm action to obtain redress of their wrongs.During the last few weeks there have been no signs in the press or elsewhere of any lessening of this resentment, which the leaders of the five parties state is stronger now than it ever has been in Palestine. This statement is an exaggeration, but that the feeling of antagonism is strong is true.At the same time, the leaders of the five Arab parties told me at the interview which I gave them on the 25th November that, unless they received a reply to their memorandum which could be generally regarded as giving satis-faction to their requests, they would lose all influence with their followers: extreme and irresponsible counsels would prevail and the political situation would rapidly deteriorate.Though I do not fear riots on a large scale, I think it right to say that in the present state of tension untoward incidents might cause considerable disturbances.Arab Parties are now discussing a boycott of Government, resignation of Arab employees, non-payment of taxes and closure of Mosques. I do not anticipate that these proposals will materialise; but requests to hold Arab demonstrations are now being received, and I think such action as strikes is not unlikely.2.   It would be well if I were to try to diagnose the causes of this hostility.In the first place, as I have reported before, the Arabs have, or imagine they have, three separate and fundamental grievances against Government.. The &apos; first is that the Arabs believe that a promise was made that an independent Arab State would be formed after the last war, an Arab State which would include Palestine.The second cause of resentment is due to the Balfour Declaration and its results.The third grievance is the neglect of Government to &quot; encourage local autonomy.&quot;3. The first is strongly felt by the Effendi class; but the second, that the Jew is &apos;: eating up the land,&quot; is felt in every town and village in Palestine, and year by year with increasing strength.My reply that the fellah now earns a higher wage has little effect. About one-fifth of Arab villagers are already landless. Village communities are well aware that they have sold, or their neighbours have sold, large sections of their land to Jews and that they have not permanently benefited by the transaction. The money has gone, the shortage of land has increased Their fear that the process will continue till the bulk of the land is gone is genuine.The sense of injury formerly directed against the Jew is now against the Government, which permits the Jew with little restriction to enter the country, and with less restriction to buy land.4. The Arabs have consistently refused to recognise the BaJfour Declara-tion, and consistently opposed all steps that the Palestine Government have taken to &quot; secure the establishment of a Jewish National Home.&quot;5. As regards the third grievance, certain steps well known to you have, in fact, been taken in the direction of encouraging local autonomy during the last few years.Provided that a Legislative Council is now established in accordance with our pledges, I consider that this grievance will cease to have foundation in fact.
6. On the subject of the first two grievances I have consistently adopted the ^attitude that I have no knowledge of any promise having been given for the formation of an independent Arab State in Palestine, and that as High Commis-sioner I fully accept the Balfour Declaration and the obligations of the Mandate; and consequently it is part of my policy to facilitate &quot; the establishment iii Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights &apos;of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.&quot;7. We may look upon these three grievances as imaginary, but to the Arabs they are real, and are the cause of a widespread belief that they have been unjustly treated. To this sense of injustice must now be added a. genuine feeling of fear that the Jews will succeed in establishing themselves iii such large numbers that in the not distant future they will gain economic arid political control over the whole country.Accepting the fact that, rightly or wrongly, the Arabs believe in this double injustice, we cannot be surprised that there exists a latent feeling of hostility towards the Mandatorj7 Power. Nor can we be surprised if untoward events, or even trivial incidents of friction between groups of the two races, cause spasmodic outbursts of disturbance, or a general increase of tension among the Arab population.The existing tension is illustrated by the recent incident described in my despatch Secret &quot; C &quot; of the 30th November, on the activities of an armed band in the Jenin area. The leader of the gang deliberately shot a policeman, yet he and his accomplices have been acclaimed by many Arab leaders and by the whole Arabic Press as martyrs and heroes, bravely sacrificing themselves in the cause Of national and religious independence.8. This increase of ill-directed national feeling has been brought about recently by three principal contributory causes.The first of these had its origin in the feeling of general uneasiness that existed this autumn in the Eastern Mediterranean, when some Arabs of cloudy mind and livery imagination pictured themselves leading non-existent armies in the cause of Arab freedom and Jewish expulsion. When realization came that these expectations would not be fulfilled and that the full authority of the Mandatory Power would be maintained, naturally enough there arose a feeling of reaction, disappointment and even bitterness.9. The second cause was due to the discovery of illegal importation of arms. About the time of this reaction a large quantity of hidden arms was discovered to have been imported into Jaffa. Port. This consignment was universally believed by Arabs to have been destined certainly for Jews and probably for the Haganaa organisation.That consignments of arms have previously been imported for Jewish organisations has long been suspected by me, and long been believed in by Arabs. Consequently, when this consignment was discovered, and the culprits could not be found, feelings of anger, resentment and fear spread through the Arab population. This feeling of fear has been enhanced by the fact that a number -of recent Jewish immigrants have acted very aggressively towards individual Arabs, over half a. dozen offenders in such attacks having been convicted in the last few months in Tel-Aviv alone.I do not suggest that Arab villagers expect an attack from Jews. I do state that Arabs are beginning to feel that when disturbances occur the Jews will be well armed and the Arabs will not.10. The third cause which has contributed to the increase of political tension is the recent disturbances in Egypt which have reacted adversely upon Arab public opinion in Palestine.11. The main reason, however, of this increased feeling of resentment is to be found in the fact that the results of Governments help in establishing the National Home grow more apparent each year and consequently more odious to the Arab people.x\arabs often quote the fact that the Jewish population in Palestine has increased from 57,000 in 1919 to 320,000 in 1935, and has increased its ownership of land from 643,000 dunums in 1919 to 1,300,000 dunums in 1935. And this figure includes some of the most valuable Urban and rural property in Palestine.Such are the fundamental and immediate causes of Arab resentment towards Government.
12. In December 1933 I wrote to the Secretary of State that the widening breach between Arabs and British would not remain stationary- either we find means of bringing ruler and ruled more in sympathy, or hostility will grow deeper and more permanent each year.By improving the material condition of the fellah and by carrying out our pledge as to a Legislative Council I hoped to achieve this object, and I remain hopeful. But goodwill is of slow growth and the Legislative Council not yet in being.13. In my despatch Secret of the 7th December, which goes by the same mail as this one, I have enclosed a memorandum signed by the leaders of the five Arab parties, together with an account of an interview which I gave them on the 25th November.The three main demands of the Arab leaders, as set forth in this memorandum, are the complete cessation of Jewish immigration, the prohibition of all sales of land, and local self-government.The last demand, in my opinion, will be fairly met by the establishment of a Legislative Council.To accept the first two demands would cause grave injustice to the Jews, but both questions require consideration.14. With regard to immigration, until the end of 1934 I considered that the number of immigrants corresponded, so far as I could judge, with the absorptive capacity of the country.In 1933 we admitted roughly 30,000 Jewish immigrants; in 1934 roughly 42,000 Jewish immigrants. The Commissioner for Migration estimates now that the total for 1935 will exceed our expectations and will amount to fully 60,000.This figure is, in my opinion, beyond the absorptive capacity of the country, and I am addressing you separately on measures I suggest to reduce the total immigration, at any rate for the present.Already signs are appearing which suggest that the limits of the present absorptive capacity of Palestine are being approached. The normal stationary figure of Jewish unemployment of 1,600 has risen to 4,500-5,000. After the orange-picking season an additional 2,000 will have to be absorbed into the labour market.15. As regards sale of land, I placed a memorandum on this subject before the Colonial Office last October.I consider some measure is needed not to prevent Jews from acquiring land, but to help Arab small holders, in view of the ever-increasing sale of land, to preserve a subsistence area. I shall be glad to hear if you approve the principle submitted in the memorandum mentioned above, in which case I would prepare more detailed proposals after discussion with Jewish and Arab leaders.16. The establishment of a Legislative Council, a reduction in the excess number of immigrants admitted.in 1934, a measure to give protection to small landowners, and an ordinance at present in draft to promote closer co-operation between Government and village communities, will all tend to check the growing antagonism felt to-day by so many Arabs towards the Mandatory Power.17. I need hardly add that I do not urge these measures on account of Arab ill-feeling or resentment; I do so because I consider that to carry out our double duty under the Mandate, these measures, which were not necessary a few years ago, are now needed under changed conditions. This is the attitude&quot;&apos; which I have constantly maintained and, subject to your approval, I shall continue steadfastly to maintain as I consider in continuity of policy lies our chief hope of inducing both Arab and Jew to accept the limitations imposed on us by the double duty laid on us by the Mandate &quot; What cannot be eschewed needs must be embraced.&apos;&apos; The measures I suggest involve or imply no change in policy; on the contrary owing to changing conditions they are called for to enable Government to maintain the principles underlying its policy of the past four years.18. Among these &quot; Thoughts on Present Discontents &quot; I have not referred to any Jewish grievances. I think none are grave, and none are considered very serious even by the Agency. They dislike the idea of a Legislative Council, but they realise Government must fulfil definite pledges, and that our present proposals will not injure the National Home as they first feared. Thev ask always for freer immigration, but they know that during the last four &quot;years, the number of immigrants admitted has exceeded all expectation. They ask that a higher proportion of Jews should be emplo&quot;ed on Public Works and in the [12550] &apos; d 2
Police, but they know that excessive high wages during the past two years has made this impossible.As Doctor Weizmann recently said, the situation of Jews in Europe compels the Agency &quot; always to ask and ask again for more.&quot; But they realise how much Government has done and is doing to help forward the National Home.Jew and Arab much as they trouble one another and often their rulers  possess fine qualities, though some of these run to excess. Acquisitiveness in the one, and an idiosyncrasy for Nationalism in the other.I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. G. WAUCHOPE,High Commissioner for Palestine:APPENDIX IV.Secret Despatch from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated December 21, 1935.(Secret.)Reference No. CF/444/35.Sir, December 21, 1935.I HAVE the honour to transmit to you for your information the acconi-accompanying  copy of a special report which has been submitted to Government by the Deputy Inspector-General, Criminal Investigation Department, on the present political situation in Palestine.2. It will be seen from this report that the political situation has further deteriorated since my despatch, Secret A of the 7th December,* was written, and that there is additional reason for Government to apprehend that it must be prepared to meet some form of hostile expression or demonstration in the near future.I believe this deterioration to be due in part to the illogical attitude Arabs here have taken as to the granting of the 1923 Constitution immediately after the riots in Cairo. They argue that attention will only be paid to their demands after demonstrations and acts of civil disobedience.3. I am not apprehensive of any immediate disorders, but there is every indication of the occurrence of trouble some time after the meeting of the Arab leaders which has been called for the 15th January, 1936. In these circumstances it will be helpful for me to be in possession of your reply to my Secret despatch before that date, and I trust that you will find it possible to send the answering despatch in time.One development in the situation which causes me particular concern and regret is that resentment against Government is beginning to spread among many villages in Palestine. While I personally receive a good welcome in every village which I visit, it is true that feelings are being roused by the large number of immigrants admitted this last year, and the constant and increasing sale of land.4.   I have the following comments to offer on the suggestions put forward &apos; in paragraph 11 of Mr. Rice&apos;s report:  (a) A general, though unofficial, warning was addressed to the Press by thePress Officer a week or so ago. While such warnings have little perceptible or immediate effect, the Press Officer continues to do everything possible to exercise a moderating influence on individual editors. It may be mentioned that the Arabic newspaper AI Difaa was recently suspended for a month on account of an article commending the example of the Egyptian riots.(b) It would not be practicable to put into effect any condition that speechesmade at public meetings should not be inflammatory or anti-British in tone.* Appendix III.
(c) It would be possible to refuse permission for those who took part in therecent meeting at Jaffa to hold political meetings elsewhere. The effect of such prohibition would, however, in fact be negligible, since the persons in question would no doubt arrange to appear and to make speeches at meetings organized by persons who were not present at the Jaffa meeting.(d) I agree that a warning should be addressed to Mohammad Ali Taher,who is a notorious agitator of Egyptian antecedents at present on a short visit to Palestine, but there are so many other active political agitators that I have some doubt whether a warning addressed to a single individual would have much practical effect.I am causing immediate enquiries to be made as to the names and activities -of political agitators who are in the same position as Ali Taher, and I shall consider this question further Avhen a report on those enquiries has been received.I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. G. WAUCHOPE,High Commissioner for Palestine.(No. 36/G/S.) Headquarters, The Palestine Police Force,^Secret.) (Criminal Investigation Department),Sir, P.OB. 850, Jerusalem, December 14, 1935.Subject: Special Report on Political Situation.I CONSIDER that it is necessary to inform you that there are a number of indications which suggest that the political situation shows signs of deteriorating, and that within the fairly near future some form of expression or demonstration against Government must be expected.Lt.-Col. Peake, Officer Commanding, Arab Legion, recently informed me that the Arabs in Trans Jordan are, for the first time in his experience, becoming politically-minded regarding affairs in Palestine. It is his opinion that the Transjordan Arabs believe disorders to be imminent.2. I am addressing you separately regarding the meeting held in Jaffa by various Arab politicians on the 9th instant, when speeches were definitely inciting and anti-Government. The tone of the press has probably been worse recently than it has been for a considerable time. I have addressed District Superin-tendents of Police and Deputy District Superintendents, and I am informed by them that the situation and the attitude of Arabs generally, particularly politicians, must be regarded with considerable seriousness. I am requesting these Officers to keep me immediately informed of any improvement or deterioration-tion in the situation.3. Recent developments in Egypt are the subject of popular discussion and the fact that disorders resulted in the achievement of some of their aspirations as far as the politicians are concerned, is being cited as a reason why disorders should be promoted in Palestine. There are reasons to support a report that the fellahin are becoming interested, to say the least of it, in what politicians describe as &quot; the Arab Cause.&quot;4. The late Sheikh Izzel Din-el-Kassam, the destruction of whose gang was reported to the Secretary of State in the High Commissioner^ despatch &quot;Secret (C) of the 30th November, 1935, is continually referred to, together with his deceased followers, as &quot;martyrs,&quot; and their action in &quot;dying for their religion and Cause&quot; is generally praised. Nuh Ibrahim, a poet of Haifa, has been visiting villages in the Tulkarm area praising the deceased and distributing their photographs.5. A noticeable feature is the development of what are known as Young Meirs Groups. Since the partial strike held on the 13th November, and more particularly since the decision of the all-party representatives to defer decision on the future course of action until the 15th January, independent young men
groups have increased their activities.   They have acquired followers and have established closer co-operation amongst them. These independent groups consist of :  (a) Akram Zueitar, and his followers in Nablus.   Their success in the partial strike on the 13th November principally, won for them the support of other political elements in Nablus.(b) Hamdi Husseini, Hashem-el-Sabie and others in Jaffa, whose connections with the Revolutionary Youth . Committee of Qalqilya has been referred to before, and who have now secured the collaboration of Michel Mitri, leader of the Arab Labour Society of Jaffa.(c) Ibrahim Shanti; in contact with certain leaders of the Istiqlal.(d) Salim Abdel Rahman and other leaders of Abu Obeida and other scoutgroups in Tulkarm area.(e) Atef Nouralla and his following in Haifa.6. They have certain followers in Jerusalem who are of lesser importance,, as Tahsin Kamal, ex-Police Officer, and Shukri Kutteineh, besides the group which Osman Kassem is endeavouring to attract to AI Liwa, which news-paper has opened its columns for Hamdi Husseini and Akram Zueitar and their inciting articles. Nimer Odeh, who recently resigned from the Department of Education, is on the staff of the paper.7. These groups are supported by certain leaders of the Istiqlal Party, principally Izzet Darwazeh of the Moslem Supreme Council, and Ajjaj Nweihed, who does not seem at present to have any obvious means of livelihood.8.   It is obvious that it is the intention of these combined groups : (a) To direct political agitation against the British authorities, and not against Zionism.   This is clear from their writings and speeches.(b) To force the party leaders to adopt some firm decision at the Nablusmeeting on the 15th January, such as non-co-operation, non-payment of taxes, demonstrations, &amp;c.(c) To stimulate agitation and public feeling until the meeting on the15th January. It was for this purpose the meeting was held in Jaffa on the 9th inst.(d) Subsequently to create disorders.9. It will be observed that Hamdi Husseini, Akram Zueitar and Ibrahim-el-Shanti are engaged in a press campaign of the most virulent nature urging non-co-operation, violence (though in veiled terms), the resignation of Arab Government officials, boycott of official receptions and eulogizing acts of Izzel Din-el-Kassam, imprisonment in the national cause and immortalizing the memory of &quot;martyrs.&quot; Sheikh Abdel Khader Muzaffar (Muzghar) visited Nablus on the 12th, and in Abclel Latif Salah&apos;s house informed a private meeting-that the public expected active measures and that Arabs should welcome imprison-ment for their actions. Abdel Latif Salah is reported to have said he was prepared to carry out the wishes of the people.10. I have received information from a reliable source, which is confirmed, that recently in the North certain Moslem ladies of the upper class were being . visited by other ladies from another portion of Palestine, as is customary during Ramadan, and were discussing the situation when one made a statement that a secret plan was afoot whereby in the near future sudden and simultaneous disorders would occur. It is, I consider, unlikely that anything untoward is to be expected until after the feasts of Ramadan. The 5th January is nominated as the 40th day after the death of the late Sheikh Izzel Din-el-Kassam and some of his followers. This date and period will need to be carefully watched, as must the proposed all-party meeting to be held at Nablus on the 15th January. 11.   I have the honour to offer the following suggestions : (a) That the Arabic press should be given a general warning couched in emphatic terms to improve their tone, and to refrain from further incitement.(5) That the question of further public meetings similar to that held at Jaffa on the 9th inst., be permitted only on sufficiently strict conditions so&apos; as to prevent speeches of an inciting and anti-British nature.
(c) The question to foe considered of refusing permission for similar meetingsto be held by the same persons as were responsible for the meeting in Jaffa.(d) That Mohamed Ali Taher be warned that if he does not cease politicalagitation in this country, he will not be permitted any further facilities to return here, once he leaves, (i?) That if it is possible favourably to reply to any of the petitions of the Arab leaders which have already been submitted to Government, that such be done as early as possible, so to placate the small remaining portion of the Arab population, which is yet not anti-Government.I have, &amp;c.
