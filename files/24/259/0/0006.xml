THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1936.SECRET Copy No.CP. 6 (36).CABINET.THE SITUATION IN EGYPT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.WE are faced at present with the following situation :  The first factor is that the 1923 Constitution has been restored, that it is to be anticipated that elections under it will be held in March or April, and that the Wafd will return with a large majority. This Constitution, as Sir Samuel Hoare, on the urgent insistence of the High Commissioner, declared in his Guildhall speech on the 9th November, has proved unworkable in the past. The line which His Majesty&apos;s Government have maintained since 1922 is to quote the letter then addressed to the Sultan that &quot; the creation of a Parliament with a right to control the policy and administration of a constitutionally responsible Govern-ment is a matter for Your Highness and the Egyptian people to determine.&quot; For this reason the High Commissioner did not oppose the restoration of the 1923 Constitution, which can only lead to a Wafdist majority in Parliament.The second factor is that a United Front composed of representatives of all the political parties in Egypt, apart from a few extreme nationalists who need not be considered, was formed during the autumn. The leaders of the Front, apart from the Wafd, have in the past taken every opportunity to suspend and finally to annul the 1923 Constitution. With the introduction of the latter, the Egyptian Government is really the Wafd. The rest of the United Front have merely climbed on the waggon, from which the elections will shake them off. A genuine United Front could only have been formed either under a new Constitution or with the express purpose of securing one. There are already signs of disintegration in the Front. The students have recently been instigated both by the Wafd and by the Liberal leader and there is reason to suppose, also by King Fuad to various excesses; which have led to serious clashes with the police and bloodshed. There is little doubt that the Wafd. could probably control them if they wish, and it has recently been reported in the press that they have decided on the formation of a &quot; blue-shirt &apos;&apos; orga.nisa.tion, with a view to bringing them under stricter discipline and increasing Wafdist power. If this is true, the programme of the Wafd is to develop at one and the same time an extremely liberal Parliamentary form of Government and an extra-Parliamentary Fascist organisation.The third factor is that the United Front presented to the High Commissioner on the 14th December, by the hand of Nahas Pasha, leader of the Wafd, a joint request for a declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government that they were prepared to conclude a treaty with the constitutional Government of Egypt in the ver)r terms of the Nahas-Henderson draft of 1930, and to settle the questions on which agreement was not then reached in the same friendly spirit. Confronted with this request, Sir Miles Lampson declared that he would forward it to His Majesty&apos;s Government. It may be argued that it would have been preferable for Sir Miles Lampson to say at once that this was an extraordinary time to put forward such a request, when constitutional changes were taking place and when. Italy was showing herself to be a grave menace to Egypt, and that for these reasons he was unable to accept the joint note. It will be realised, however, that f12564] B
Sir Miles Lampson had to &quot; think standing,&quot; with the certain knowledge that the adoption by him of an attitude of this kind would have led to further and perhaps more serious disorders than had already occurred, with attendant bloodshed. In any event Sir Miles Lampson did not, in fact, take this line, and we must therefore face the present situation as it is. .On the 27th December Sir Miles Lampson was instructed to return an interim reply, giving him latitude in regard to whom he should convey it apart from the Egyptian Prime Minister. This reply was to the effect that I was giving the Egyptian situation my most serious and urgent consideration, and more particularly the question of treaty negotiations raised by the United Front, that this examination would take some time, and that it would then be necessary to refer it to the Cabinet; Sir Miles Lampson was authorised to assure the Egyptians that their request for treaty negotiations would be most carefully and S3unpathetically considered by me, and that in the meantime His Majesty&apos;s Government had no intention of departing from their attitude towards treaty negotiations indicated by Sir Samuel Hoare in the House of Commons on the 5th December. (Sir Samuel Hoare declared that His Majesty&apos;s Government looked forward to the re-establishment of Anglo-Egyptian relations on a permanent footing satisfactory to both countries. The whole matter was receiving their earnest and constant consideration, with a view to finding the best means of achieving this result and of assuring that the failures of the past should not be repeated. They had no intention of letting the matter drift, but it was obviously impossible for them in the midst of the preoccupations caused by the war in Abyssinia simultaneously to engage in negotiations in a matter of such importance. They would not be expected to fix a definite date for beginning negotiations, but this was not to say that they did not consider a solution possible, or that its achievement should be relegated to a dim and distant future.)Sir Miles Lampson has since been instructed to lay stress on the necessity of preventing renewed disorders, and to emphasise the point that the responsibility for maintaining order belonged in the first place to the Egyptian Government, and I have also instructed him in his conversations with Egyptian leaders not to encourage suggestions from any quarter one whit beyond the lines of my telegram of the 27th December mentioned above, All the Egyptian leaders with whom Sir Miles Lampson has discussed the situation have pressed for the -acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the 1930 terms.A decision is now required as to the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government are to adopt in the light of the situation described above. It is, in my view, important that we should abandon the present defensive position in which we find ourselves before the Wafd return to power; otherwise, the Egyptians will not understand that they are on trial and not in triumph. It is in Wafdist interests to try how far they can take us towards their own conception of a treaty under cover of others less suspect than themselves, and in the light of past -experience we cannot assume that the Wafd really want even the most favourable treaty which His Majesty&apos;s Government might be in any way likely to give them. The following alternatives may be considered : 1. We might convey a warning both to the Wafd and to King Fuad. The warning to the Wafd might be on the lines that we do not intend to put difficulties in the way of their working their Constitution, but that, equally, we do not intend to take it for granted that they would not use it against co-operation with us as they had done in the past. For these reasons, and in the face of the present international situation, we were not prepared to conclude a general treaty settle-ment now. If, however, the Wafd wanted something in the way of a treaty now, we were prepared to offer them a two-clause treaty, constituting an alliance between the two countries, and containing the.recognition by Egypt of our right to maintain troops on Egyptian territory for the purpose of securing imperial communications. Such a treaty would usher in a policy of gradual solution of the reserved points, and it might even be possible to make some kind of a beginning with the Capitulations : e.g., Egypt and we might start drawing up a joint programme to be laid before a conference, which can hardly be called together under present conditions. It would be necessary to ensure that it would exclude Egypt&apos;s entry into the League of Nations until the remainder of the reserved points had been settled. Sir Miles Lampson, however, reported in his telegram No. 23 of the 8th January (see Annex I) that the Egyptians are at present set
[12564]on a typical full treaty settlement, and that a military alliance would no longer be accepted by them as a substitute. It is therefore to be anticipated that the adoption of the course suggested in this paragraph would lead to rioting and disorder, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government might be involved in a situation in which they would have to. take control of Egypt themselves in the face of a hostile population and Government.2. The second alternative would be to present the Egyptians with a complete draft treaty. The military clauses of the 1930 draft (Command Paper 3575, p. 35) are out of the question now. A revised draft was, however, prepared in 1933 and in full agreement with the Service Departments, which stiffened up the 1930 proposals in several important respects and left open the question of the removal of the troops to the Canal for subsequent decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government. As contrasted with the 1930 negotiations the high-water mark from the Egyptian point of view the new draft, while maintaining the main features of the 1929 and 1930 drafts, offered to Egypt:  (1) The abolition of the restriction on her sovereignty represented by the-1922 reserved points, thus making possible her admission into the League of Nations;(2) The alliance with Great Britain;(3) The removal of the British forces from the cities (as stated above, this point was left open to final consideration); . (4) The opening of the way to a substantial modification of the Capitulations..and presented the following modifications : (1) Far-reaching revision in accordance with the considered requirements of the Service Departments, of the areas allotted to the British forces within the Canal Zone.(2) Abolition in the event of war, threat of war, or serious disturbance within the Empire or in adjacent territories, of the restriction on the numbers of the British land and air forces to be maintained in Egypt.(3) Provision for the absolute freedom of movement of British service air-craft.(4) Egypt&apos;s assistance as an ally (use of ports, aerodromes, means of communication, &amp;c.) to be available not merely in time of war, but also of internal disturbance within the Empire.(5) Definition in a separate convention of the privileges and immunities to be secured to the British forces in Egypt. [There should be little difficulty about this : it was not ready in 1930.](6) Strengthening of the provisions for the retention of a foreign element,, including British commandants, in the Egyptian city police.(7) Strengthening of the provision intended to secure against the replace-ment of British officials by nationals of other foreign Powers.(8) As contrasted with 1930, the chief British officials in the Egyptian service-(the Financial and Judicial Advisers) are to be retained, not for the period of their existing contracts, but, in the case of the latter, until the contemplated internal reforms, and in particular the transfer of jurisdiction from the consular to the Mixed Courts are completed and tested. The position of the Financial Adviser is left more vague. It would undoubtedly be in the interests of both parties if the post were retained until the treaty settlement had been carried into effect, but we -could perhaps rely, in part, on the Egyptians, appreciating this for themselves.(9) Elimination of the article allowing for reopening of the question of the Sudan within one year from the coming into force of the treaty. (10). Minimum period of validity of the treaty settlement extended from ten to twenty years.(11) Provision for periodical meetings of a Nile Commission in Cairo under the presidency of an Egyptian Minister.Of these eleven major modifications, the first ten will infallibly be construed by the Egyptians as constituting derogations from the 1930 offer. As compared with 1929, Nos. (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) may be regarded as constituting modi-fications in our favour.
The question of the removal of the British troops to the Canal was left open; it seems clear that in present circumstances a complete removal to the Canal is out of the question, and that the military clauses which were discussed in ,1933 may require to be stiffened still further. The military clauses and those relating to the future of the Sudan are vital; it is essential that our view in regard to both questions should be accepted by the Egyptians; and the former will give us the best case before public opinion in England and elsewhere for refusing to grant the terms which Egypt demands. The adoption of this course would probably mean that no treaty settlement would be possible, and the effect would be the same as the adoption of alternative (1), namely, rioting and disorder, resulting perhaps in His Majesty&apos;s Government having to take control of egypt^pt themselves.3. The third alternative would be to temporise, informing King Fuad, the Egyptian Government and Egyptian leaders that we cannot consider negotiation for a treaty during the present crisis created by the Italo-Abyssinian war, that meanwhile they must keep peace and order in Egypt, and that we should be prepared to explore the ground with a view to the conclusion of a treaty as soon as the international situation permits and in the light of the experience which the present Italian menace to Egypt has shown to be necessary. It seems clear from Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegrams that the effect of such an announcement would be the same as that of the two previous alternatives, and that again military action by His Majesty&apos;s Government would be the result.4. We have explored the ground with Sir Miles Lampson in so far as is possible by telegraphic correspondence, and his views on the alternatives open are contained in his telegrams Nos. 23 and 24 (see Annex). His recommendation is that our reply to the United Front should be to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government are quite prepared to enter forthwith into negotiations with the Egyptian Government for an Anglo-Egyptian treaty settlement, but as the whole treaty hinges on the military clauses His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest that the two Governments, with the help of their military advisers, should discuss confidentially and as potential allies the application of the military terms of the 1930 treaty to the changed situation of to-day. Sir Miles Lampson considers it more than likely that the Egyptians may answer that they would be prepared to enter into any such discussions, provided that they received an assurance from us that we accepted the non-military terms of the 1930 draft, in which event His Majesty&apos;s Government would refuse to give such an assurance, on the ground that any expression of opinion on the non-military clauses was useless unless there was agreement on the strategic issues on which the whole treaty depends. Sir Miles Lampson feels, however, that such an attitude on our part might again lead to fresh disorder, although it would appeal as reasonable to a considerable section of the Egyptian public living under the menace of Italian aggression. Sir Miles Lampson adds that, if this suggestion finds favour, it follows that His Majesty&apos;s Government should decide urgently what are their minimum strategic requirements for adequate safeguarding of imperial interests; he gravely doubts whether military terms involving the permanent occupation of Cairo and Alexandria or their immediate vicinities would be accepted by any Egyptian negotiators. Sir Miles Lampson puts forward this alternative on the clear assumption that, in the event of agreement being reached on the military clauses, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to accept the rest of the 1930 draft without substantial modification and subject to a suitable agreement possibly later about the Sudan.   He emphasises the need for a speedy decision.The position of King Fuad should here be mentioned. It seems probable that he is following the stages with which we have been familiar in the past: intrigue against any Government supported by us : bringing the Wafd into office on the principle that a violent cure is the shortest : a Wafdist embroilment with us, preferably over the treaty issue : profit by the reaction which always follows in such circumstances in order to regain the reins of Government for the Palace interests. Whatever action is now taken, it seems essential to tell King Fuad that he must make Egyptian policial leaders act sensibly, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not allow an unsatisfactory ending to be turned to King Fuad&apos;s profit.There are.disadvantages involved in all the alternatives discussed above, but I have little hesitation in urging the adoption in substance of the fourth  Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s alternative.   Our immediate object is the preservation of
peace and order in Egypt during the present emergency, and the maintenance of cordial relations with the leaders of all parties in the country. The course proposed is more likely to; achieve this than any of the others. Our ultimate object is the liquidation of the 1922 Reserved Points. Recent events have thrown into clearer light the vital importance of Egypt from the strategic aspect, andv have emphasised if emphasis were needed the vital necessity of our ensuring that the military provisions of a comprehensive treaty settlement with Egypt must be such as to ensure that the defence of Egypt and of our Imperial commurnoa-tions is absolutely assured for the future. The discussions which Sir M. Eampsori would inaugurate and which would be conducted -in Egypt should show whether this objective is obtainable at present.I suggest, therefore, that I be authorised to instruct Sir M. Lampson to reply to the United Front in the terms he suggests with the modifications underlined below and to acquaint King Fuad at once with its terms. He should at the same time firmly impress on both that the consequences of failure would be serious, and that in such an event His Majesty&apos;s Government might have to reconsider their whole policy towards Egypt. Sir M. Lampson should also make it clear that once the military clauses were settled the Sudan clauses would have to be discussed next. In his communication to King Fuad he should include the warning suggested above.The reply would be as follows :  His Majesty&apos;s Government are quite prepared to enter forthwith into conversations with the Egyptian Government with the object of arriving at an Anglo-Egyptian treaty settlement, but in view of the paramount importance of its military provisions His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest that as a preliminary to negotiations the two Governments, with the help of their military advisers, should discuss confidentially and as potential allies the application of the military terms of the 1930 Draft Treaty to the changed situation of to-day.Should the Egyptian representatives ask whether, in the event of an agree-ment being reached on the military provisions of a treaty, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to accept the 1930 draft for the remaining clauses; Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s reply should be governed by the following considerations : It is not possible to discuss other matters in detail pending agreement on the military provisions. While His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to reach -agreement upon a treaty as a whole, they do not and cannot consider themselves bound by the provisions of the Draft Treaty of 1930 or by the provisions of any other inconclusive negotiation. His Majesty&apos;s Government do not, of course, intend by this to convejr the impression of any rigid attitude, but they must make plain the elementary principle that no Government either could or would consider itself bound by the provisions of a draft wdiich was never signed.A. E.- 1 - foreign Office, January 10, 1936.
ANNEX.Sir- M. Lampson to Mr. Eden. (Received January 8.) (No. 23.   Important.)(Telegraphic.) Cairo, January 8, 1936.YOUR telegram No. 5.Public opinion here honestly considers His Majesty&apos;s Government to have accepted and to be committed to 1930 with the Sudan as the sole outstanding-question. This view finds support in statements made by responsible Ministers at the time, notably in Mr. Henderson&apos;s declaration to Egyptian delegation recorded on p. 8 of Command Paper No. 3575. According to Hansard Weekly, Mr. Dalton is reported as saying on 5th December last that 1930 &quot; negotiations then broke down on the question of the Sudan; everything else was settled.&quot; So far as known here, none of these statements has been modified or contradicted-2. Therefore (see your telegram), the only treaty policy which in the eyes of the Egyptian public would appear reasonable is one accepting in substance all that we accepted in 1930 except the military clauses, some modification of which could be reasonably represented as justified and even imposed by sequence of changing circumstances.3. Apart from the fact that 1933 draft differs greatly in form from 1930, there are several substantial modifications in our favour which do not seem compatible with &quot;basis&quot; of 1930 and which are difficult to justify on the ground of changed circumstances in the interval, e.g., tightening up of obligation to employ only British officials, reservation of British police element and main-tenance of advisers. I do not say that I should not on merits have liked to see-these modifications, but the pass was sold in 1930, and it strikes me as difficult to press for them now if we wish-as I think rightly to maintain the criterion postulated in your paragraph 4.  Paragraph 3a is answered above.4. Paragraph 3b. Military alliance would no longer be accepted by the Egyptians as a substitute for typical full treaty settlement, on which they are at present set. Egyptian co-operation in the matter of martial law and modernisation of Egyptian army with condition of attachment of British officers-should not be regarded as tempting concessions to the Egyptian Government;: they are certainly not so regarded by Egyptians.5. Paragraph 3c. See my paragraph No. 2 above differing from para-graph 6 (2). To ensure this most desirable object our offer should include military clauses adequate to safeguard our clearly demonstrable strategic interests, but otherwise giving Egyptians as complete control of their internal affairs as-possible.6. Paragraph 8. Responsibility of Egyptian Government for maintenance of law and order has been time and again strongly stressed (see my telegram No. 15); paragraph 4 of my telegram No. 687 purported to indicate impossibility of getting any formal statement from United Front such as suggested from home and the inadvisability of our suspending treaty issue pending the receipt of some such unattainable assurance.7. Above answers to the best of my ability the points raised in your telegram under reply. For a suggested course of action, see my immediately following telegram.Sir M. Lampson to Mr. Eden. (Received January 8.) (No- 24.   Important.)(Telegraphic.) Cairo, January 8, 1936.MY immediately preceding telegram.I suppose the best way of approach to the problem would be to reply to^ United Front&apos;s demand in the following terms : -2. His Majesty&apos;s Government are quite prepared to enter forthwith into-negotiations with the Egyptian Government for an Anglo-Egyptian treaty settlement, but as the whole treaty hinges on military clauses His Majesty&apos;s
-Government suggest that as a preliminary to negotiations tne two Governments, with the help of their military advisers, should discuss confidentially and as potential allies the application of military terms of 1930 draft treaty to the changed situation of to-day.3. It is more than likely that the Egyptians may answer that they would be prepared to enter into such military discussions provided that they received an assurance from us that we accept non-military terms of 1930 draft which we accepted in 1930. In that event we would refuse to give such assurance on the ground that any expression of opinion on non-military clauses was useless unless there was an agreement on strategic issues on which the whole treaty depends. But see last paragraph.4. It is equally possible that this attitude on our part might be used as a pretext for fresh disorder, but it would appeal as reasonable to a considerable section of the Egyptian public living under the menace of Italian aggression. Presumably the same would apply to British and world opinion.5. The main advantage of this course is that we would not again have ^declared our official acceptance of non-military terms of 1930 only to find that negotiations thereafter break down on military issue. I am advised that in 1930 negotiations it was suggested from here that Sudan clause should be taken first in order that the Egyptians might not get all they wanted out of us on other issues and then break over the Sudan. In the event, that is, in fact, what actually did happen.I suppose that military issue should be regarded now as analogous to Sudan -clause in 1930.6. If this suggestions finds favour, it follows that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should decide urgently what are our minimum strategic requirements for -adequate safeguarding of our imperial interests. I gravely doubt Avhether any military terms involving permanent occupation of either Cairo or Alexandria or ^of their immediate vicinities would be accepted by any Egyptian negotiators, but this could at least be explored.7. The above suggestion is based on clear assumption that, in the event of agreement being reached on military clauses, His Majesty&apos;s Government would, as suggested in my immediately preceding telegram, be prepared to accept the rest of 1930 draft without substantial modification and subject to a suitable agreement (possibly later) about the Sudan. It would, in my opinion, put us on a thoroughly bad wicket if, after obtaining agreement of the Egyptians to our military requirements, we then announced that His Majesty&apos;s Government went back on non-military clauses, which the Egyptians (basing themselves on white paper) regard as already having been agreed to.8. I feel bound once more to emphasise the need for speedy decision. &quot;Though outwardly orderly, situation remains electric.
