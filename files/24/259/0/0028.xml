(THIS DOCUMENT. IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT) IrET CABINET . COPY NO . 3$&apos;28(36LONDON RATING  (UNOCCUPIED HEREDITAMENTS) BILL. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH&apos;.My colleagues will be aware that the London CountyifCouncil bare introduced a Bill providing for the rating of unoccupied properties.      The Bill, which is highly controversial, will be opposed by a number of our supporters and is likely to be put down for-debate at an early date. .    I shall no doubt be expected to express an opinion on the measure on behalf of the Government,  and I shall be glad to know that the line which I propose to  take has the approval of the Cabinet.The rating of unoccupied - properties has for long been the subject of discussion, and I do not think it is necessary to trouble the Cabinet with the detailed arguments for and against the  principle.      It is sufficient to say that I propose,  if my colleagues concur, to oppose the Bill mainly on the ground that the case for so revolutionary a change in our rating system has not been established, and further,  that a change of this magnitude should not in any event be applied to a single area, and is not therefore appropriate to local legislation.(Intld. )    K.W.7th February,  1956
