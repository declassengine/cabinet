(fjfTSjpOOUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BBITAKNIO M&amp;TSSTY^ GOVERNMENT) .S E CJL E T - COPY NO.     %P P^17 (36). CABINET.EDUCATIONAL POLICY COMMITTEE.SECOND REPORT.1. The -Cabinet Committee on Educational Policy, which was originally constituted in February 1934 (Cabinet 5 (34)Conclusion 5),  is now,  as part of the new arrangements approvedafter the last General Election and set out in CP,  219 (55),composed of the following Ministers :-The Lord President of the Council, The Chancellor of the Exchequer, The Lord Chancellor, The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister without Portfolio,The President of the Board of Education,The Minister of Health,The Minister of Labour.3, The position is that the main educational proposals ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government,  so far as they require legislation, are now contained in draft English and Scottish Education Bills, which heve &quot;been approved by the Home Affairs Committee, and are under consideration &quot;by the Cabinet.      The Cabinet,  at its Meeting on -January 22nd 1936 (Cabinet 2 (36) Conclusions 7 and 8), referred to the Committee certain points on the two Bills which had &quot;been reserved for Cabinet determination by the Home Affairs Committee and any other points of diffi culty that might be raised.      The Committee met on January 2.3rd,  1936,  and it then appeared that the only points requiring their further consider-ation were the following :-(a) The proviso to Sub-section 2 of Clause 2 of the English Bill, and the corresponding proviso of the Scottish Bill.      The broad effect of these provisos,  as drafted, was that exemptions from
the obligation to attend school until 15, forbeheiieial employment, would, normally operate only fron the end of each school teraj    if, hoFfcver, the Local education Authority issuing the employment certificates had been furnished, before the beginning of the term, with information sufficient to satisfy it that employment beneficial to a child was available, the Authority was empowered to issue a certificate in that case curing the course of a term.(b) The effect of the nnglish Bill was to continue the crediting of Unemployment Insurance contri-butions for attendance at schools between 14 and 15 in England and Wales whereas in Scotland, after the 1st September,  1939,  such credits will not begin until the child has attained the age of 15.(c) The question of empowering Local Authorities in Scotland to provide medical treatment in Scottish Instructional Centres.Grant of emcloyaent certificates curing a school term. 3.      After careful consideration we think that each case should be decided on its merits by the Local Authority in the light of its local knowledge and in the interests of the individual child.      This cm,  in our opinion, be secured by a somewhat more elastic formula than that contained in the provisos as at present drafted,  and we accordingly recommend the substitution for thuse provisos of some such wording as followss-
&quot;Provided that the issuing authority when so satisfied may nevertheless suspend certifi-cates of emplojanent until the end of the school term&quot;.It will, of course, he understood that we have adopted this formula subject to any drafting amendments  which Parliamentary Counsel may find it necessary to make, and to any consequential alterations which may be required.Creciting of Unemployment Insurance Contributions.4.        We are agreed that in this matter, uniformity of futurepractice throughout Great Britain must be secured and that suchuniformity can only be secured by new unemployment insurancelegislation.      It has been suggested to us that the principleof the crediting of contributions for children of 14 to 15will in future be wrong,  and that accordingly the Governmentshould decide to bring the practice in England and Wales into conformity with the practice in Scotland.      On the other hand,we think that such a reversal of the 1934 policy in thisrespect would be difficult to  justify,   and that it would be politically impracticable to introduce within the next threeyears legislation which would take away privileges granted inSection 1 of the Unemployment Act,  1934, and continued by theEnglish Bill-.      We also think that the decision cf the Govern-ment should be announced forthwith.      We accordingly recommend:&apos;-That a statement should be made on the Second Reading of the Education Bill in the House of Commons to the effect that the Government Lave decided that. the position in Scotlauid in regard to the crediting of Unemployment Insurance contributions shall be brought into 2Vhe with the position in England ana Wales;    that for technical reasons effect cannot be given, to this decision by means of the present educational legislation but that the decision will be fully implemented before the raising of the school leaving age provisions of that legislation come into operation in 1939,,Medical Treatment in Instructional Centres in Scotland.5* We are advised that the title of the Education (Scot la/id )Bill precludes the introduction of a provision enabling local
authorities in Scotland to provide medical treatment in their Instructional Centres,  and this matter will there have to &quot;be dealt with in other legislation on some convenient opportunity in the future.Signed on &quot;behalf of the CommitteeJ.
