THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1936.SECRET. Copy No.g.p. cabinet.DISPUTE BETWEEN ITALY AND ABYSSINIA.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.SIR MILES LAMPSQN, the High Commissioner in Cairo, recently forwarded to the Foreign Office a report giving an account of a conversation between one of the British officers in the Egyptian Police and two newspaper correspondents, one American and the other either German or Austrian, who had recently returned to Egypt from Eritrea. I feel that this report, containing as it does a first-hand account of the situation in Eritrea, will be of interest to my colleagues. I therefore circulate it herewith, together with a minute recording a conversation between one of these newspaper correspondents, Captain Strunck,. and a member of the Residency staff, and a letter addressed to Sir Miles Lampson by the Times correspondent at Asmara vouching for the good faith of Captain Strunck.A. E.Foreign Office, January 6, 1936.I.I BEG to report that I received the following information from the two journalists who arrived from Massawa in the s.s. Victoria the 14th December. 1935 .--Courtney: An American representative of Colliers Weekly, now at the Metropolitan Hotel, Cairo.Strunck, Roland Edgar: Who is identical with the Strunck mentioned in OS.OP. Confidential Letter Pol/114/27 of the 21st October, 1935. He gave his address as^the German Legation, Cairo.Both men left for Cairo on the noon train on the 15th December, 1935, and 1 hope to see them again on the arrival of the transport s.s. Sannio expected shortly.2. General Conditions in Eritrea.(a) Casualties.Very few casualties from fighting, but they are heavier than rated. Very little sickness, but my informants expect sickness to be rampant as soon as the rains start. The heaviest casualties are due to lorry accidents. The authorities admit to an average of 20 lorries totally wrecked daily. As most of these lorries fall 2,000 feet, the crews are usually killed. In one day&apos;s run up to the front line the journalists saw the wrecks of 27 lorries and eight drivers killed.8268   [12540]
(b) Roads.The roads are described as appalling. They state that when the rains commence the only road that will be left will be from Massawa three-quarters of the way to Asmara.   The chief cause of the lorry casualties is the road conditions.(c) Morale.The morale is very poor.  My informants said that there is not one man who would not give five years of his life to go home. This is due to 1. Bad living conditions.2. Inactivity and the dread of disease.3. The continuous sniping from behind the lines.4. The very bitter feelings that exist between the Blackshirts and the regular army.5. The realisation by both the officers and the men that they have reached the limit of their advance and that there is no chance of the smashing victory they had hoped for.(d) Reason for the recall of Marshal De Bono.There is a great deal of enmity between the Blackshirts and the regular army. The regular army refused to serve under De Bono, who is, of course, a Blacksbirt leader. De Bono&apos;s staff were openly accused of pocketing a large percentage of the funds used for bribing the tribesmen.Badoglio, a regular soldier, has stated that he will not advance until the Blackshirts&apos; leaders are sent home. One of the first under this policy was the Conte Ciano, Mussolini&apos;s son-in-law.(e) Reason for the recall of the Conte Ciano.1. Caused bad feeling in the regular army in his capacity as Minister of Propaganda by giving all publicity to Blackshirts, and principally to himself and the two Mussolini boys. Badoglio in a speech has declared that in future the names of individuals will not be mentioned, not even his own.2. Adopts the attitude of Mussolini&apos;s representative in Eritrea. Holds parades, &amp;c, which annoys the army officers.3.   Once killed 36 Italian Askaris in mistake for the enemy.4. Several officers claim to have positive proof that Ciano and Mussolini&apos;s sons shoot bullet holes in their own aeroplanes with their pistols.(f) Remarks.The journalist Strunck is an ex-captain in the Austrian Army, and practically admitted to being in the pay of the German Government. I was unable to get as much as I would have liked out of him as time was short and the other journalist most talkative.Strunck&apos;s impressions in his own words were roughly as follows :  &quot;&apos; The Italians will never advance another foot in Eritrea. Although there is no sign of mutiny now there is very great disappointment which may turn to mutiny later. Organisation is non-existent, it is more like an operette than a war. I have lived among soldiers all my life, but in Eritrea I never once felt that I was with an army.&apos;&apos;I realised that as an Austrian Strunck might be rather embittered against the Italians, so I took the opportunity to sound the American separately. His views were almost identical and was most- emphatic in saying that the Italian Army in the North had reached the limit of its advance.Both journalists say that they will give me more information if, and when, I see them again.Port Said, December 17, 1935.
Captain Strunck, representative of the Volkischer Beobachter, called this morning with a letter of recommendation to his Excellency from Mr. Fraser, Times correspondent at present in Eritrea.Captain Strunck had just come from Asmara and gave me the following information in the course of a general conversation :  1. There was complete chaos and disorganisation behind the Italian lines, particularly at Massawa, where vast quantities of oil and stores were lying about insufficiently guarded, and could easily be set ablaze by any intelligent incendiary.2. There was very bad feeling between the army and the Blackshirts.3. Particularly under Marshal de Bono&apos;s regime the extravagance and corruption at headquarters over supplies, &amp;c, had been notorious. Marshal Badoglio was determined to bring greater order into head-quarters.4. The Italian troops had had no real fighting at all, and so far only native troops had been engaged in the two or three minor battles that had taken place.5. The roads were completely inadequate for the lorry service required for supplies. He had moved about in a &quot; Balilla&quot; up to the front lines, and always found convoys held up indefinitely and many lorries broken down.6. Marshal Badoglio, in his effort to tighten up control, now allowed no press correspondents to the front, and only issued featureless communiques. He had sent home Ciano, of whose self-advertising sensationalism he disapproved.In Captain Strunck&apos;s opinion, the Italians would have been much more successful with a force of 70,000 men than with 300,000, who only got in each other&apos;s way.   His impressions were most unflattering to the Italians.December 20, 1935.III.My dear Lampson, Asmara, December 11, 1935.This is to introduce my friend, Captain Strunck, whom I first met at Harbin doing journalist work for his paper by adventurously accompanying the Japanese troops engaged in bandit suppression. He was afterwards wounded in Jehol.Now he has been here, but unluckily has been compelled by an attack of dysentery to leave, and is going to recuperate in Egypt, after which he will probably return to Abyssinia. While in Cairo he hopes to hear something reliable about the position and you can talk freely to him with confidence. He and I have been great friends and I have found him a first-class partner in a little car, &quot; Balilla,&quot; we bought here, and in which we did some exciting journeys, two of which have been described at length in the Times by myself.I shall appreciate greatly anything you can do to enlighten Strunck aboutE87Pfc-There is quite a flutter here about settlement proposals said to be put forward by the British, but I find it difficult to believe that people like myself are going to get off so quickly and easily.   I shall hope to see you sometime soon.Ever yours,DAVID FRASER.
