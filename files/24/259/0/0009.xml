*      4This document is the property of His Britannic Majeaty&apos;fe Government.Printed for the Cabinet, January, 1936SECRET.CP. 9 (36).THE CABINETTHE ITALO-ABYSSINIAN DISPUTETHE EFFECT OF RAINFALL ON THE operations in&quot; ABYSSINIAMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARTable A attached shows that the amount of rainfall in the northern half of Abyssinia increases towards the south and west. The figures for Macalle are not available, but from its position they may be taken to be between those of Halai and those of Harar.The table shows also that although the i*ainfall in Addis Ababa is not excessive until June, the quantity of rain which falls along the eastern edge of the Abyssinian plateau from April onwards is sufficient to interfere seriously with military operations and is, in fact, in excess of that which falls in September.Precipitation occurs in the form of violent rainstorms which from April fill the upper reaches of the rivers- crossing the Italians&apos; main line of communications. If, therefore, drains, culverts and bridges on the main roads are not completed by the end of March, communication will be interrupted and many stretches of road will be washed away. With adequate weather-proof roads it would be possible for the Italians to operate for limited periods during the months of Api*il and May. As there is not now time in which to develop such communications, the Italians would have to conduct operations along tracks liable to be washed away at short notice and across rivers liable to rise in flood behind them. The extent to which they rely on armoured fighting vehicles and mechanical transport would accentuate these risks. From these considerations it follows that unless the Italians can complete their communi-cations by the end of March, they will be forced to withdraw ; if they succeed in completing their main roads by that date, they will be employed during April and Ma)&apos; in consolidating their position and constructing accommodation for their troops during the period of the heaviest rains. In Somalia the dry season ends in March, and, as the Italians are not constructing roads in this theatre of operations, they will be unable to operate with large forces after that date. In this connection the heavy rainfall at Harar from April onwards should be noted.D. C.The War Office,20th January, 1936.Copy No. 4 3
