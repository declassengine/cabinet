THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1936.confidential. Copy No.C.P. 15 (36).CABINET.FREEDOM OF ACCESS TO COLONIAL RAW MATERIALS.Note by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AS a result of Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s speech at Geneva on the 11th September. 1935, an Interdepartmental Committee was set up to examine the question of the distribution and accessibility of Colonial raw materials. The Departments represented on this committee were the Treasury, the India Office, the Colonial Office, the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office, and I understand that my colleagues in charge of those Departments have already received the Committee&apos;s Report direct. In view, however, of the importance of the report I feel it should be communicated to the whole Cabinet and therefore circulate it herewith.It is clear that the first point to be decided in regard to this Report is whether or not steps should now be taken to place the question of &quot; Colonial raw materials&quot; on the agenda of the Council or the Assembly of the League of Nations. In my own view both the existing political situation and the conclusions of the report itself render it undesirable to take any action at Geneva at the present time. In the event of the question being raised at Geneva by any other Power it would, no doubt, be possible for the time being to delay any immediate investigation by a reference to Sir S. Hoare&apos;s statement to the effect that &quot; such an enquiry needs calm and dispassionate consideration and calm and dispassionate consideration is impossible in an atmosphere of war and threatenings of war.&quot;But whatever decision may eventually be taken in regard to an investigation of the problem at Geneva, it is probable that the attached Report may have to be considered fairly soon in its relation to the general foreign policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.A.

INTERDEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON FREEDOM OF ACCESS TO COLONIAL RAW MATERIALS.REPORT.Preliminary.WE were appointed to consider Sir Samuel IIoare&apos;s statement regarding &quot; colonial raw materials &quot; in his speech to the Assembly of the League of Nations on the 11th September; to examine its implications; and to prepare for submission to Ministers recommendations regarding the form and terms of reference of any League enquiry.2. We give the relevant paragraphs of Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s speech in Appendix I. We have also taken into account the following Minute of the 9th September by Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, then Secretary of State for the Colonies : &quot; We cannot escape discussion of this problem (i.e., the whole &apos; colonial problem &apos;); it is one of the big outstanding questions causing friction and unrest among the Powers. Unless some sort of settlement of it is reached in the comparatively near future, it will lead to serious trouble. In all the circumstances, and despite some disadvantages, I think it a good move for us to take the initiative in raising the question, attempting to get the subse-quent discussion into a channel which causes us least embarrassment, the channel of economic aspects rather than political aspects.&quot;.3. We have to deal with the colonial aspirations of non-colonial Powers. In practice this means the colonial aspirations of Italy, Germany and Japan, for, though other Powers such as Poland have shown signs of becoming &apos;&apos; colonial-minded,&quot; their aspirations need not yet be taken seriously. When therefore we refer in this report to &quot; the starved Powers &quot; we mean only Italy, Germany and Japan. It is worth noting that while to the United Kingdom and probably France the aspirations of Germany and Italy loom largest, to the Netherlands,, whose colonial possessions in the Far East are very great, the aspirations of Japan, would appear more important.4. We propose in this report to deal solely with that aspect of the &quot; colonial problem &quot; which relates to freedom of access to raw materials. We shall there-fore leave aside not only the purely political aspect of &apos;&apos; prestige &apos;&apos; (perhaps the most important of all), but also other economic aspects such as (i) The desire for a protected market where home manufactures can be sold under preferential conditions and where Government contracts are exclusively or usually placed in the home country.8273   [12549] b
(ii) The desire for an area of opportunity for emigration, employment and investment especially perhaps for the employment of the young educated class in administrative and commercial jobs.These matters hardly come within our terms of reference, but we feel that it is legitimate to doubt whether it will be possible to avoid discussion of at least the other economic aspects if any part of the problem is made the subject of enquiry by the League of Nations. Of the three Colonial Empires which are of real importance in the eyes of the &quot;starved Powers,&quot; the British, the Dutch and the French, the two former were until recently open more or less freely to the imports of all the world, only the latter being reserved to the home country by preferential customs systems. In the last few years, however, the system of preferential import duties has been widely developed in the British colonial Empire and many foreign imports into the Dutch Empire have been restricted by quota. This change has increased the ambition of the &quot; starved Powers &quot; to enjoy the advantages of a preferential colonial regime. Japan, already a colonial Power with Korea, Formosa and the Pacific Islands, has extended her Empire over Manchuria, where she has, in fact though not in form, preferential advantages; Italy clearly intends to develop any acquisitions she may make in Abyssinia to provide markets for Italian goods; and Germany no doubt has similar ambitions. It is a tendency which is inseparable from the economic nationalism which is the prevailing creed. It seems to us more than likely there-fore that the other economic aspects will come up in any discussions at Geneva. It is true, of course, that short of a transfer of sovereignty those discussions could not lead to the giving to the &quot; starved Powers &quot; of a preferential market in colonial territories; but they might well lead to a demand for the &apos;&apos; open door.&apos;&apos; We give in Appendix II a brief statement of the extent to which the &apos;&apos; open door &apos;&apos; does and does not exist in the British Colonial Empire. This statement will be sufficient to show that such discussions might be a little embarrassing.British colonial territories.5. We give in Appendix III a full list of the British Colonial Empire, including mandated territories. It includes the East and West African dependencies, Mauritius, Ceylon, Malaya, Hong Kong, various islands in the Western Pacific, the West Indies, Palestine, Cyprus, Malta and a number of miscellaneous territories.Mention should also be made of the Mandated Territories of South West Africa administered by the Union of South Africa, of New Guinea and Nauru(x) administered by the Commonwealth of Australia, and of Western Samoa administered by New Zealand; also of Papua, which is a dependency of the Commonwealth of Australia. Southern Rhodesia, a &quot; self-governing Colony,&quot; Newfoundland, temporarily under the control of the United Kingdom, and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan are in rather special positions.Foreign colonial territories.6. This report does not attempt to deal in detail with corresponding colonial areas in the possession of foreign countries, but for convenience of comparison the following may be mentioned : France Algiers (constitutionally part of France), Tunis, Syria (under Mandate), Equatorial Africa (including Cameroons under French Mandate), West Africa (including Togoland under French Mandate), French Somaliland, Madagascar, Indo-China, various Pacific Islands. French Guiana, various West Indian Islands.Netherlands Netherlands East Indies, Dutch Guiana, Curacao.Spain Rio d&apos;Oro, Fernando Po, Spanish Guinea.(x) Mandated to &quot; the British Empire.
Portugal Angola, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, Madeira, Azores and other islands.Belgium. Congo (including the Mandated Territory of Ruanda Urundi).United States of America-Philippine Islands, (2) Porto Rico, Hawaii (constitutionally part of the United States).Italy Tripoli, Eritrea, Italian Somaliland. Japan Korea, Formosa, various islands in the Far East under Mandate.Interpretation of &quot; colonial raw materials.&quot;7. We considered first the interpretation to be given to the words &quot; colonial raw materials &quot; for the purposes of this Report. The following are the principal exports from the British Colonial Empire with the value of exports in 1933 (this was, of course, a year of depression and values a few years previously would have been very much higher) :   Rubber     .........      ...       ...      ... 13,000,000Oil seeds and nuts, copra and vegetable oils ... 11,500,000Tea.................. 9,000,000Suaar and sugar products       ...      ...       ... 8,700,000Cocoa       .................. 7,000,000Tin          ......      ............ 5,300,000Fruit and fruit products......      ... 4,300,000Copper     .................. 3,300,000Cotton                ............... 3,300,000Petroleum           ............      ... 3,100,000Gold         ...       ............... 2,900,000Coffee       .................. 1,700,000Hides and skins............... 1,300,000Sisal and other hard fibres      .......... 1,300,000Many other commodities of minor importance individually, but collectively worth some  20 million, are also exported.The above list would also cover the main exports from the colonial territories of other Powers.8. It will be seen that many of the colonial exports are not, strictly speaking, &quot; raw materials.&quot; Gold is in a category by itself. Other important exports, such as tea, coffee, fruit, are exported ready for consumption. We have assumed that the considerations which make certain Powers desire freer access to raw materials, according to the strict meaning of the word, apply also to these commodities which are not strictly raw materials. Germany, for instance, would object strongly if her supplies of coffee were cut off. We therefore interpret the term to cover all the primary prodxicts of the colonial dependencies of any Power.The present position.Freedom of access in the British Colonial Empire.9. We have considered the present position in regard to &quot;freedom of access &quot; to raw materials in the British colonial Empire, and three main facts emerge. The first is that, as pointed out in Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s speech, there is at present no natural scarcity of any of the products of the Colonial Empire; indeed, colonial producers would be very pleased to sell more of them to any(2) In view of recent developments it is questionable whether the Philippines should now be reckoned as a Colony.[12549] n 2
country which could pay for them, and, with the single exception of tin-ore (with which we deal in paragraph 23 below), there is nothing whatsoever to prevent Germany or any other country buying as much of British colonial produce as they like to pay for. It is not, for instance, Nigeria&apos;s fault that her exports to Germany (chiefly oils and oil-seeds) have fallen from  4 million in 1930 to  1 million in 1934. She would have welcomed far larger purchases of her raw materials.In general, there is no evidence that colonial raw materials, whether from British or foreign territories, are withheld from those who need them. They have in recent years been pressed on every market in the world, with the result that their prices fell during the depression far more than proportionately to the prices of manufactured or semi-manufactured goods.10. The second fact is that the possession of colonial territories does not in itself ensure freedom of access to all necessary raw materials. On the one hand, there are a great many important raw materials which are not produced in any colonial territory. On the other hand, it would require a very large colonial territory indeed to satisfy all the requirements of a large metropolitan country like Germany for certain raw materials which are colonial; oils and oil-seeds for-instance. According to the Economist, the total exports of the German Colonies to Germany in 1911 were  2,105,000, compared to total imports of raw materials, excluding foodstuffs, of  270,000,000. Even the vast resources of the whole British Empire are insufficient to supply the bulk of her requirements of cotton, petroleum, barley, maize, tobacco, iron ore, most classes of timber, and many other important raw materials.11. The third fact is that, generally speaking, it is open to foreign nationals and foreign capital to buy, trade in and exploit the resources of our own Colonial Empire on the same terms as British concerns. This point requires some elaboration.12. &quot;Equality of opportunity&quot; to buy, trade and exploit resources is already formally guaranteed by the Mandates of the A and B class, and by the Congo Basin treaties in the territories to which those instruments apply.(3) The same principle has been followed in practice in all other parts of the Colonial Empire, with the following minor limitations : (a) The exploitation of petroleum in certain territories is reserved to companies under British control. A change of policy has been under consideration for many years and may shortly be effected.(b) In a number of cases it has been convenient to grant concessions forthe exploitation of materials, particularly of minerals, to single companies. While there may have been no conscious discrimination in the grant of the original concessions (and while, in fact, discrimination is precluded in Mandated Territories and the area covered by the Congo Basin treaties), the concessionnaires have generally, though not invariably, been British, and their existence effectively prevents foreign participation in the particular field to which they apply. At the same time, it is practically impossible to develop certain kinds of resources except by way of concession. Concessions may be divided into two classes : one where the initiative comes from the would-be concessionnaire (e.g., normally, concessions for development of minerals); the other, where the initiative comes from the Government (e.g., normally, hydro-electric power concessions). The principle of equality of opportunity may reasonably be regarded as being preserved in the first case if a foreigner is not prevented in law or in fact from applying for a concession and getting it, and, in the second case, if tenders are invited by public notice and the best tender accepted. No doubt it would in future be possible to conform to arrangements such as these. As pointed out above, they are already obligatory in certain parts of the Colonial Empire and customary in the remainder.(3) The Mandates held by the United Kingdom are those for Palestine and Transjordan (A class), Tanganyika Territory and parts of Togoland and the Cameroons (all B class). The British territories to which the Congo Basin treaties apply are Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika Territory, Zanzibar, Nyasaland and a small part of Northern Rhodesia.
1*3. It should also be borne in mind that exploitation by European individuals&apos; or companies plays a smaller part proportionately in the policy of the British Colonial Empire than in that of France or Belgium; for instance, native policy throughout West Africa precludes the granting of concessions for -agricultural development to Europeans, whereas there are many highly important concessions of this nature in the French and Belgian colonies.14. It. is also true that, however scrupulously legal and administrative discrimination may be eschewed, there is naturally less incentive to a German or Italian to invest capital or to settle in a British Colony than there is to a British subject; for, if he does so, he must live under a foreign flag in a country where foreign laws are administered by foreign officials responsible to authorities in a foreign metropolitan country and where he may find discriminatory duties imposed on the goods which he wants to import from his home country. But this is equally true of settlement in any foreign metropolitan country.15. In practice there are many examples to prove that in the British Colonial Empire advantage has been taken of the policy of &quot; equality of oppor-tunity &quot; by foreign nationals. We have already mentioned that, apart from tin ore, there is nothing to prevent foreigners buying all the colonial goods they like to pay for, and they do, in fact, regularly buy very large quantities. In the Mandated Territories there are many German settlers and enterprises; for instance, in the five years from 1929 to 1933 there were 1,254 German immigrants into Tanganyika, compared with 1,494 British immigrants (other than officials) and 835 other Europeans. In the Cameroons the flourishing and expanding banana-growing industry is entirely in German hands and the fruit is all shipped to Germany in German boats. In Palestine there are a number of Italian and German enterprises.16. Outside Mandated Territories, there are many examples of foreigners - engaging in trade, though comparatively few of those foreigners are Germans or Italians. Much the greater part of the banana trade of Jamaica and other West Indian islands is conducted by American-controlled companies. In West Africa, where European activities are largely commercial rather than productive, German, Italian, French, Syrian and other foreign traders compete freely with British West African merchants. In the sphere with which we are more immediately concerned, the production of raw materials, the following important examples m&amp;y be noted of exploitation by concerns which, though the actual company may sometimes be British, are known to be directly or indirectly under foreign control.   In some cases exclusive rights have been granted :  Iron ore : Malaya (Japanese). Manganese : Malaya (Japanese).Gold Coast (United States). -Rubber : Malaya and North Borneo (Japanese, United States, Belgian,French, -Danish and Italian). Oil: Trinidad (United States). Bauxite : British Guiana (United States). Cohune Nuts : British Honduras (United States).The foreign rubber estates in Malaya and North Borneo cover a considerable area, the total of Japanese estates alone being reckoned at some 140,000 acres, producing 12,000 tons of rubber a year. Generally, the most important foreign enterprises are American, no doubt because the United States have had more money available for investment than, say, Germany and Italy. The American cohune nut enterprise in British Honduras has actually been assisted out of the Colonial Development Fund.Freedom of access in foreign colonies.17. As to the position in colonies of other countries, the Mandates and the Congo Basin Treaties should prevent discrimination in the territories to which they apply. The Dutch Government have always welcomed foreign co-operation in the development of their Empire, and in the Netherlands East Indies there ;are many foreign-controlled companies operating. The number of British -companies is particularly large and there are also important American and
sJapanese interests. For instance, Japanese subjects hold concessions for rubber-planting believed to total nearly 400,000 acres in extent and a report has recently appeared in the press that an area of 150,000 acres in Dutch New Guinea has been leased to a Japanese company for cotton growing. In the Portuguese colonies there are many British interests. We have not examined the legal position in French colonies to which the Mandates and Congo Basin Treaties do not apply, but, whatever the technical position, in practice foreign concerns for the exploitation of raw materials are not welcomed.Reasons for the desire for freer access.18. In view of the facts which we have set out above, it seems that the desire for freer access to raw materials can hardly be due, so far at any rate as the British Empire is concerned, to existing difficulties in the way of foreigners-engaging in production or trade, nor can it be due to the fact that the potential supply of colonial raw materials does, or is likely to, fall short of the actual demand. What, then, are the causes of this desire ? It is possible, we think, to-distinguish three main causes of varying importance : First, the fear of being held to ransom by international agreement among the various producers of colonial raw materials.Secondly, the fear lest supplies should be withheld or made difficult of access either in normal peace time or in time of war or emergency.Thirdly, inability to pay for all the raw materials required at world prices..We proceed to examine these three causes further.(1) Fear of being held to ransom : International control schemes.19. First as to the fear of being held to ransom by international agreement among the various producers of colonial raw materials. The fact of over-supply has led to international schemes of regulation in the cases of rubber, tin, tea and copper. In the cases of rubber and tin, the regulation schemes are the result of an agreement between the Governments of all (or practically all) the producing countries in the world. In the case of tea, the scheme is controlled by the producers of the three main producing countries themselves, but has the backing of the Governments. In the case of copper, the agreement is solely one between the producers, and is comparable to any other cartel agreement covering raw materials, e.g., the aluminium cartel.20. The object of these schemes is not, of course, to prevent any country from getting the supplies it wants, but to withhold from the market supplies in excess of possible requirements which can only have the effect of depressing prices to an unremunerative level. No discrimination is exercised in this with-holding of supplies; that is, the total export or production is limited, but no restriction is placed on the markets to which such exports may be sent. The schemes have, it is true, given rise to definite fears by consuming countries lest they should be held to ransom. These fears have been most pronounced in the-United States, which is far the largest world consumer of both tin and rubber and produces none itself, and they are largely a legacy from the Stevenson Scheme, the earlier rubber regulation scheme which was in force from 1922 to 1928. In that case there was some justification for the alarm in the United States, and the matter became one of considerable political importance. Prices- &apos; were raised to very high levels and wide fluctuations occurred.21. The present rubber scheme and the other regulation schemes have, however, little resemblance to the Stevenson Scheme. There has been considerable development in the technique of the control of raw materials since those days, and all the present Governmental schemes are governed by the principles laid down in the report of the World Economic Conference. Among these principles were the following : Any agreement to give effect to such plans (i.e., for the co-ordination of production and marketing) should conform, generally to the following-conditions : .... It should be fair to all parties, both producers and consumers; it should be designed to secure and maintain a fair and remunera-
(2) Fear lest supplies should be withheld or made difficult of access.23. The second factor which we mentioned as contributing to the desire for freer access to raw materials is the fear lest supplies should be withheld or made difficult of access either in normal peace time or in time of war or emergency.As regards normal peace time, the most obvious way of. discrimination is by preferential or prohibitive export duties. The only examples of discriminatory export duties in the British Colonial Empire are those on tin-ore shipped from Nigeria, the Federated Malay States and Johore.These duties, which are so high as to be prohibitive, were imposed in Malaya in 1904-7 and in Nigeria in 1916 with the object of preventing the smelting of tin-ore elsewhere than in the British Empire. They are levied on all exports of tin-ore unless the exporter can satisfy the Government that the ore will be smelted in the British Empire.The question of removing these duties would require careful consideration, since it involves questions of imperial defence, but, without having given the matter this detailed consideration, it seems to us not improbable that their removal might be feasible. Incidentally, it may be remarked that the Dutch are able to ensure the smelting of all the Netherlands East Indies tin within their Empire without the need for such discriminatory export duties, since the Dutch Government themselves own a controlling interest in the industry.It is not so long since there were other preferential export duties in the British Empire, e.g., on palm kernels from West Africa. We are not aware of the existence of any export discriminations in the Dutch Empire, but there are many in the French Empire, some of them very heavy, and in one or two cases export to destinations outside the French Empire is actually forbidden. It is also worth mentioning that there are certain preferential export duties in favour of Italy in the Italian North African colonies, though the items concerned are of little importance.24. Another way in which supplies could be withheld or made difficult of access is through the regulation of shipping. For instance, the policy of the French Government in recent years appears to have been to free themselves from all treaty obligations in their Colonies in regard to foreign shipping, so as to be able to use the colonial trade as a preserve for French shipping. It is believed that France is now free from any treaty obligation to accord national treatment in colonial ports to the ships of any nation, but the French Government have not yet used their freedom to exclude foreign ships on a large scale from their colonial trades, nor in other respects to make raw materials from their Colonies difficult of-access.tive price level; it should not aim at discriminating against a particular country and it should, as far as possible, be worked with the willing co-operation of consuming interests in importing countries who are equally concerned with producers in the maintenance of regular supplies at fair and stable prices.In conformity with these principles, both the rubber and tin schemes make provision for the representation of consuming interests upon the International Committees responsible for their running. In fact a representative of German manufacturers sits with an American and a British member on the Consumers&apos; Advisory Panel to the International Rubber Regulation Committee.22. This representation of. consumers was somewhat in the nature of an experiment; the experiment is, we believe, proving most successful, and helpful to all concerned. The consumers&apos; representatives have, at present, only an advisory capacity upon both Committees, but it would probably be possible, if circumstances demanded it, to admit them to even closer participation. The results of this experiment covering so large and important a field seem to show that the interests of consumers and producers are not so wide apart as is often imagined. Manufacturers, consumers, and wholesalers put the primary emphasis upon stability of price, rather than upon the actual price level; and this stability the regulation schemes are intended to secure, and have in fact already secured, in so far as it is possible to judge at present.
25. As to the position in time of war, the advantages of colonial dependencies as sources of raw materials are obvious, though it is equally obvious that those advantages only last so long as overseas communications are-uninterrupted Germany found her colonies useless in the last war. That raises-questions of strategy and sea power with which we are not concerned.It is necessary also to take account of emergencies short of war, the present emergency for instance. On this point the following summary by the Times correspondent in Rome of a recent article by Signor Gayda illustrates Italian feeling at the moment: &quot; One of the principal complaints made against Great Britain, and to-a lesser degree against France also, is that owing to their command of supplies of petrol, cotton and other prime raw materials derived from their oversea possessions, they could resist with relatively little inconvenience an &apos; economic siege &apos; such as is now being laid to this country. So long as this situation obtains there cannot, it is said, be any true justice and fairness in the system of economic sanctions, and the only remedy for this &apos; revolting injustice and intolerable danger &apos; is for &apos; the possession of the exclusive power of disposing of raw materials to be reserved to the League of Nations without any national privileges.&apos; &quot;In regard to this we might point out that no League &apos;&apos; possession &apos;&apos; of raw materials or guarantee of free access to them could help Italy, for neither would help Italy to pay for what she wants, nor would either be a bar to the application of sanctions on exports to Italy. Nothing short of the possession of colonial territories would help Italy in the present emergency. Nevertheless, this expression of opinion by a leading Italian publicist is significant.(3) Difficulty in paying for raw materials.26. The third factor which we mentioned is perhaps the most potent at the-present time, namely, the difficulty which Germany and Italy and, indeed, many other countries, find in paying for all the raw materials they want. As a result, despite the plentiful supplies of these raw materials which exist, consumers have to go short of a large part of their requirements. The inability of Germany and other countries to pay for the raw materials in question arises from the fact that they have to be paid for in foreign exchange. But if it is hard to buy foreign-commodities with, e.g., marks, this is only because the mark is overvalued and its real value is not the same as its official value: in other words, while a credit in, say, sterling can be used to buy any goods anywhere, a credit in marks can be used only to buy German goods in Germany at such prices as the German Government mav determine. The suggestion that the purchase might be easier if the producers-were within the German currency system only means, in effect, that it would be-easier if the countries producing these raw materials were under German sovereignty, for we find it difficult to conceive of a divorce between currency sovereignty and political sovereignty; the transfer of the latter is, we understand,, not suggested. (*)27. There is one further point which should be mentioned here, while we-are dealing with inability to pay for raw materials. It is sometimes argued that the &quot; starved Powers &quot; would be able to pay for more colonial raw materials if they were able to sell more of their own manufactured goods in colonial territories.. and that for this reason, if for no other, there should be at least an &quot; open door &quot; for the goods of all countries.(5)   It seems to us that this argument is only(*) Compare Sir Eric Pliipps&apos;s despatch No. 1305 of the .10th December, 1935,. paragraph 13:  &quot; The currency crisis has induced Dr. Schaoht and many others to demand colonies where Germany or German chartered companies can produce raw materials without paying for them in foreign currency. Rightly or wrongly, sincerely or disingenuously, Dr. Schacht and the vast mass of the German people claim that the colonies to which Germany is morally entitled will assist her materially in solving the currency crisis. A guarantee of the open door and the abolition of all monopolies in raw materials are of little interest to Germany. There is no complaint of monopolies, no complaint that raw materials cannot be obtained, only that they must be paid for in foreign currency, which Germany has not got.&quot;(5) We have already had occasion to refer to this point in another connection in paragraph 4. See also Appendix II for a statement of the extent to which the &quot; open door &quot; does and does not exist in the British colonial Empire.
partially valid. It is not yet true that there must necessarily be a direct relation between imports to a colony and exports from it; the bulk of trade does not yet run only in such two-way channels; and we think that a more correct view of the real grievance of the &quot; starved Powers &quot; is that they have difficulty in selling their goods in any foreign market because of competition by other producers aided by preferential duties, import quotas, devalued currencies, lower labour costs or greater efficiency. At the same time, there is a marked tendency towards bilateralism in trade at the present day, a tendency which has affected even the United Kingdom, so that, for example, there is a growing pressure to prevent Spain and Hungary from using an undue proportion of the sterling proceeds of their sales to the United Kingdom to buy raw materials outside it. Moreover, even though colonial markets are only a fraction of the world market, any removal of trade barriers which enabled the &apos;&apos; starved Powers &apos;&apos; to sell more of their goods, would give them more foreign currency with which to buy the raw materials they need. It must therefore be admitted that, in theory at least, systems of &quot;imperial preference&quot; whether by tariff or quota add appreciably to the difficulties of the non-colonial Powers, and lend weight to their advocacy of the policy of the &quot; open door.&quot;28. However, while it is true that the abolition of such restrictions as these in Colonial Empires would enable foreign countries as a class to compete more freely with the metropolitan countries concerned, it would not necessarily assist the individual European countries such as Germany and Italy, which have been most vocal. Immediately, Japan would probably benefit most by this change, owing to the advantages which she enjoys in her labour costs. Germany and Italy might well not benefit at all.It has been suggested that some formula might be devised whereby, in effect, existing restrictions were retained on Japanese goods. For example, the &quot; door &quot; might only be &quot; opened &quot; to the goods of countries who are parties to the various International Labour Conventions. Japan has, however, most-favoured-nation rights, at any rate in all British colonial territories except West Africa, and unless steps were taken to put an end to these rights (which we imagine would not in present circumstances be desired so far as British colonial territories are concerned) discrimination against her is thereby precluded.We therefore think that, if &apos;&apos; psychological&apos;&apos; factors are disregarded, the-abolition of existing restrictions would give little real advantage to the &apos;&apos; starved nations &quot; in Europe, however far it might go towards satisfying Japan. In any case, it is important to realise that, unless some mitigation takes place of the tariff quotas, trade agreements and so on, which are at present so notable a feature of world trade, the abolition of restrictions in colonial dependencies (especially if it involved a corresponding loss of preferential treatment for colonial products in the metropolitan market) would place them at a serious disadvantage in negotiations with foreign countries. Indeed, one of the defects (from a strictly colonial point of view) of existing &quot; no discrimination &quot; clauses is that they enable certain countries to sell to the areas concerned without taking anything in exchange. Naturally, if trade was freer all round this disadvantage would be correspondingly diminished.Scope of the proposed Enquiry.29. We come now to a difficult and important question, the scope of the proposed enquiry. Sir Samuel Hoare, in his speech, suggested that the enquiry should be limited to &quot; raw materials from colonial areas, including Protectorates and Mandated territories,&quot; and it is solely with such raw materials that we have dealt so far in this report. But in the course of our study of the implications of this proposal, it became clear to us that it would give rise to certain difficulties, and we therefore venture to suggest that a slight modification of the scope of the enquiry may be found desirable.30. In the first place, it is clear that any proposals for an enquiry put forward at Geneva must be so framed as to secure the assent of the other major colonial Powers. We see no great reason why the Dutch or the Belgians should object to an enquiry into &quot; colonial raw materials &quot; pure and simple. It may be doubted, however, whether such an enquiry would meet with the assent of the French GoArernment. We have already in paragraphs 17 and 23 pointed out [12549] c
that there is far more discrimination against foreigners in the French Colonial Empire than in either of the other major Colonial Empires, and the proposed enquiry might, in effect, develop into an indictment of French colonial policy. We feel, therefore, that on this ground alone some alteration of the basis of the enquiry would be useful.31. There are indeed, other practical considerations which seem to render such a course desirable. In the first place, with a few minor exceptions,(6) the raw materials produced in colonial dependencies are also produced elsewhere in the world. In fact, of the more important colonial products, excluding palm kernels and palm oil, which cannot be considered apart from competing oilseeds and seed oils, it is only in the case of rubber, cocoa and tin that colonial dependencies are responsible for more than one-half of world production. We give in Appendix IV the countries of origin of the main colonial products and the approximate percentage originating in colonial territories. It may well be argued that if, for instance, it is desired to guarantee free access to supplies of copper, there can be no logical reason for limiting that guarantee to copper from Northern Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo, while not including also copper from Canada, the United States and Chile.Further, there are many commodities of equal importance to the &quot; starved Powers&quot; which are not produced in colonial dependencies at all or are only produced in negligible quantities, as, for instance, wool. Why assure free access to cotton and not to wool ? or to copper and not to nickel ?32. Again it may be argued that the object of the enquiry is to exorcise the sense of grievance and the covetousness which certain Powers now feel because in the scramble for empire they have come off worse than other Powers; these feelings, it may be said, extend to all forms of empire and therefore the Powers concerned might desire the enquiry to cover the Dominions and India as well as colonial territories. It might be argued that most of them were at one time &quot; colonial territories,&quot; and it would doubtless be urged that the United Kingdom could in time of need draw the greater part of her supplies from them. In these circumstances to point to the present international status of the Dominions and India might not be regarded by the &quot; starved Powers &quot; as a sufficient answer. Indeed, while the position of the Dominions is becoming generally known, the practical independence of India in commercial matters is not well recognised by foreign Governments and if the United Kingdom Government sought to exclude India from the scope of an enquiry it would be hard to convince them that she was not doing so out of self-interest.Other possible limitations.33. We think that there is much in the arguments against the limitation of the enquiry precisely in the manner proposed. We have felt bound therefore to consider whether any other limitations can be suggested which will not be open to such objections.Theoretically, if a guarantee of free access to raw materials is really needed, it may be admitted that no enquiry could be entirely satisfactory unless it covered every primary product wherever produced-^soya beans from Manchuria, cotton, petroleum and many other commodities from the United States, wool from the Dominions, wheat, butter and eggs from the Dominions and from half Europe as well, coal from the United Kingdom and several European countries, and so on and so forth. But obviously an all-comprehensive enquiry would raise far too many difficulties to be at all practicable and the enterprise must be limited in some way or other if it is to achieve any useful purpose.34. If it were urged by people unacquainted with the constitutional position that the enquiry would not satisfy the &quot; starved Powders &quot; unless the Dominions and India were included, the answer would be that they are themselves members of the League and if the enquiry is to cover them, why not all other members of the League, too? Such a suggestion would thus lead straight back to an .all-comprehensive enquiry.(6) Camphor is produced solely in Formosa, pimento solely in Jamaica; cinchona is only exported from the Netherlands East Indies (and possibly in small quantities from the French colonies), but it is also produced in India and could be produced in many other countries.
35. To surmount this difficulty it might be suggested that the enquiry should cover all &quot;tropical products.&quot; But that we feel would give rise to-endless difficulties of definition. Is tin, which is also produced in Cornwall, a tropical product ? Are groundnuts or palm oil tropical products and not their competitors, soya beans and whale oil ? Obviously it would be quite impossible-to arrive at a satisfactory definition.36. A more practical line of approach, we suggest, is that the enquiry should be directed to certain specified raw materials of &quot; colonial type,&quot; that is, raw materials of which there is some production in colonial territories and which are also produced not only in India or the Dominions, but in other parts of the world too cotton, oils and oilseeds, &amp;c, &amp;c. As the result of such an enquiry there might be one instrument covering all the raw materials specified, or more probably there would be separate instruments relating to each article and guaranteeing free access to it. Each such agreement would presumably be open for signature by any Power, whether colonial or not. It is worth remarking that, while the existing regulation schemes for tin and rubber (see paragraphs 19 to 22) relate only to production and do not contain any guarantee of free access,, they nevertheless show the possibility of international agreement in regard to-individual products of colonial type which are also produced in places other than colonial territories (Siam and Bolivia are parties to the tin agreement, Siam and India to the rubber agreement); and they could conceivably be expanded if need be to contain a guarantee of free access. We have shown how successful has been the experiment of consumer &apos;s representation on the body controlling each scheme.37. It must be admitted, that there are undoubted objections even to this proposal. Its efficacy as a means of satisfying the &quot; starved Powers &quot; would depend on the number and nature of the commodities in regard to which it was eventually found possible to conclude effective guarantees of free access. If the list were short and included merely such things as tea and cocoa, the greater part of which is produced only in three countries, agreement would no doubt be comparatively easy, but the satisfaction to the starved Powers would be negligible. If, on the other hand, the list were long, and particularly if it included oils and oilseeds (to which Germany would probably welcome a guarantee of free access more than to any other commodity), it would cover the majority of the countries of the world and the range of enquiry might be thought too great for the achieve-ment of practical results.38. In short, there are objections to all the possible courses. We feel that of all those which we have discussed the last is on balance the most practicable and the most likely to lead to concrete results. We do not attempt to set out the list of the raw materials which should be covered; we suggest that might be the first task of whatever organ of the League is deputed to undertake the enquiry.39. If it is thought that it would be hopeless to expect such an enquiry to result in guarantees of free access covering enough of the ground to give any satisfaction to the &quot; starved Powers,&quot; it might be possible to combine (a) guarantees in respect of a few such specified raw materials, whether produced in colonial territories or not (e.g., tin, copper, rubber), with (&amp;) a general guarantee in respect of colonial raw materials, pure and simple. This latter proposal would not be likely to appeal to the French for the reasons given in paragraph 30, but it would not be open to the other objections to an enquiry into colonial raw materials only.40.   To sum up this part of our enquiry, we have reached the conclusions that: (a) an enquiry into raw materials from colonial areas, including&apos; Protectorates and Mandated territories, would hardly be acceptable to the French, and anyhow is open to the objections that few raw materials are even preponderatingly colonial in origin, that many important raw materials are not colonial at all, and that the &quot; starved Powers &quot; might argue that, to be effective, raw materials from the Dominions and India should be included;(6) an all-comprehensive enquiry, whether approached from the territorial basis or from the angle of all raw materials, would be unlikely to yield, any practical results;[12549] c 2
(c) to any argument that an enquiry should include the Dominions or India, the answer is that they are themselves Members of the League; if they are included, wiry not all other League Members, too ?id) an enquiry covering all tropical products would be equally impracticable; and(e) while there are-objections more or less strong to every course, that which seems most practicable is so to frame the enquiry that the aim may be separate guarantees of free access in respect of certain individual raw materials, whether produced within a colonial territory or not. The raw materials to be covered would be specified in the course of the enquiry. If the probable objection of the Trench is not thought to rule it out, the guarantees in respect of individual raw materials, whether colonial or not, might be coupled with a general guarantee in respect of all raw materials produced in colonial territories.41. We feel bound, however, at this point to repeat that action on these lines may not be accepted by the starved Powers as at all a substantial method of meeting the grievances which they feel psychological, strategic, economic and monetary. We are not therefore convinced that these proposals will avert demands for something in the nature of a political redistribution of colonial possessions. The progress that can be made by economic arrangements seems to us to be substantially limited by the facts of the case, and any Government taking an active part in promoting an enquiry in this sphere may, we feel, find difficulty in putting forward a remedy which will do enough to mitigate the more acute and in some respects substantial grievances wdiich the non-colonial Powers entertain. In fact, it is arguable that the remedy suggested may antagonise France without satisfying Germany, Italy or Japan, or in any way diminishing such colonial ambitions as they cherish.Procedure.42. We are required by our terms of reference to make recommendations in. regard to &quot; the form and terms of reference of any League enquiry.&quot;As regards the form of the enquiry, there are alternative methods of procedure. The matter can be submitted either to the Council or to the Assembly.43. (1) If the Council is selected, the Foreign Office will write to the Secretary-General of the League proposing that an enquiry should be initiated and submitting a memorandum for circulation to Members of the Council. The Council might then deal with the matter in three ways : (a) constitute an ad hoc committee, draw up its terms of reference andinstruct it to report back to them.(b) refer the question to the Economic Committee for enquiry and report.(c) transmit the matter to the Assembly, where the subject was first raised.(2) If it is decided to take the question to the Assembly, the Foreign Office will write a letter to the Secretary-General at least one month before the opening of the session, and request that the subject should be placed on the agenda. The procedure in the Assembly would normally be to refer the question to the Second Committee (which deals with economic and financial questions), or to the Sixth Committee (political questions). The Committee would discuss the proposal and submit a report and resolution to the Assembly. The most probable recommenda-tion would be the appointment of a Committee to report back to the Assembly in 1937.44. The next ordinary session of the Council is on the 20th January, but the matter can hardly be read^ by then.   The next meeting after that is in May.The next ordinary session of the Assembly (the seventeenth) is in September. It is possible that a special session of the present Assembly (the sixteenth), which stands adjourned, may be summoned to deal with the Abyssinian dispute. Any new question could be added to the agenda of this session bj^ a two-thirds majority; a two-thirds majority is also required before the Assembly can proceed to its immediate consideration. To add a new question to the agenda of the present session would be a most exceptional proceeding.
Terms of Reference.47.   It will be seen that whatever procedure is adopted precise terms of reference will not be required at the first stage.48.   We append a summary of this report.SUMMARY.We have assumed that the intention of Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s speech was to take p aragraphs the initiative in raising the &apos;.&apos; colonial problem &quot; and to attempt to get the 1-2-discussion confined to the economic channel.We observe that in practice the &quot;colonial problem&quot; means the colonial Paragraphs, aspirations of Italy, Germany and Japan.   If to us, and probably the French, the aspirations of Germany and Italy loom largest, to the Dutch those of Japan appear more important.We confine ourselves to the aspect of freedom of access to raw materials, Paragraph 4. leaving aside not only all political aspects such as prestige, but also the other economic aspects such as the desire for a protected market for home manufactures and for an area of opportunity for migration, &amp;c. We confess to some doubt, however, whether it will be possible for any public discussion to be limited equally strictly. The increase in recent years of import restrictions has brought to the front the utility of areas where protected markets may be enjoyed.We give a list of the territories constituting the British Colonial Empire, Paragraphs noting that three of the Dominions would also be concerned in any enquiry as holders of mandates.  We mention the other Colonial Powers, France, the Nether-lands, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the United States, Italy and Japan, and give a list of their more important possessions.We interpret the term &quot; colonial raw materials &quot; to cover all the primary Paragraph 7. products of the colonial dependencies of any Povifer, and we give a list of such products.We consider the present position as to &quot; freedom of access &quot; to these raw Paragraph 9. materials in the British Colonial Empire and note First, that there is no natural scarcity of any of them at present,Secondly, that the possession of colonial dependencies does not of itself Paragraph 10. ensure freedom of access to raw materials, since even the British Empire is dependent on foreign countries for many important commodities, petroleum, for instance, and thirdly, that with minor exceptions it is open to foreign nationals and Paragraphs foreign, capital to undertake the exploitation of the resources of the 11&quot;16*Colonial Empire on the same terms as British subjects. While a foreigner inevitably has certain obstacles to overcome which a British5-6.45. The selection of one of these alternatives must be determined by the degree of urgency with which it is desired to consider the question and by the degree of emphasis which it is wished to lay upon it. The most dilatory and at the same time the most normal procedure would be to put the question on the agenda of the next ordinary session of the Assembly. If it is desired to raise the question at once, but to spin out the enquiry, then alternative 1 (c) is preferable. If it is desired to consider the question urgently and to give it considerable publicity, it would be better to advocate alternative 1 (a). If, on the other hand, His Majest3r&apos;s Government wish to raise the matter in an inconspicuous manner, the best course would seem to be to press for alternative 1 (b).46. We do not feel competent to express an opinion as to which alternative should be adopted. In any case, before His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom take the initiative it would no doubt be desired to make some approach to the Governments of India and the Dominions, and it is also for consideration whether it would be advisable to give prior notification to the other colonial Powers.
subject does not have, language for instance, there are plenty of foreign enterprises engaged in production in the Colonial Empire. We give a number of examples.Paragraph 17. As to freedom of access in foreign colonial dependencies, we believe the position in the Netherlands Empire to be much the same as in our own Colonial Empire. The Congo Basin Treaties prevent discrimination in the Belgian Congo and in certain French territories, but in the rest of the French Empire and to a less extent in the Portuguese Empire, there is definitely not free access for foreigners.Paragraph is. We distinguish three main causes for the desire among the &apos;&apos; starved Powers &apos;&apos; for freer access to raw materials: First, the fear of being held to ransom by international agreement among the various producers of colonial raw materials.Secondly, the fear lest supplies should be withheld or made difficult of access either in normal peace time or in time of war or emergency, and thirdly, inability to pay for all the materials required at world prices.Paragraphs ^ In examining the first cause we discuss the characteristics of the tin and rubber regulation schemes now in force and show that they contain safeguards for the interests of consumers.. In examining the second cause we mention the existence of discriminatory export duties on tin ore from Nigeria and Malaya (imposed in the interests of the British smelting works which are considered to be of imperial importance), and on many commodities in the French Colonial Empire; and we discuss the extent of the advantage given by the possession of colonial dependencies in ensuring free access to raw materials in time of war and emergency.We give the opinion that in present circumstances, the last cause is the most potent, at any rate with Germany and Italy, but are unable to propose a remedy short of the devaluation of their currencies or a transfer of sovereignty over colonial areas.Paragraphs In this connection we deal with the suggestion that the &quot; starved Powers &quot;27-28. woui(j he able to pay for more raw materials if they were able to sell more of their own manufactured goods in colonial territories. We consider that there is some truth in this, but we point out that the removal of restrictions in colonial dependencies, though it might benefit Japan and have some &quot; psychological &quot; value, would not, in fact, necessarily benefit Germany and Italy at all. It would, however, destroy a main argument for the grant of preferences by metropolitan countries, and would place colonial territories at a serious disadvantage in negotiations with foreign countries.Paragraphs We then turn to the scope of the proposed enquiry, and suggest that if it is29-32&apos; limited to &quot; colonial raw materials &quot; it is not likely to be welcomed by the French, In any case it seems to us that there are other practical considerations which render some alteration of the basis of the enquiry desirable: First, rubber, cocoa and tin are the only commodities produced even prepon-deratingly in colonial territories. The greater part of all the other &quot; colonial raw materials &quot; is produced outside colonial areas. We give a table illustrating this point. Why deal only with the colonial portion of the supply?Secondly, there are many commodities, in every way comparable to the &quot; colonial raw materials &quot; which either are not produced in colonial areas at all or are only produced in negligible quantities- wool, for instance.  Why omit them?Thirdly, it might be argued that the enquiry could hardly succeed in its object unless at any rate the Dominions and India were in some way covered also.Paragraph S3. But in practice some limitation will be essential and what other limitationcan be suggested?Paragraphs23-25.Paragraph 26.
January 7, 1936.It would be impossible to include the Dominions and India with colonial Paragraph 34. territories unless all other Members of the League were also included.One way round the difficulty would be to limit the enquiry to tropical PaiagraP3l..40 products. This would, in our view, be impracticable. a better suggestion is, we think, that the enquiry should be so framed that its aim would be separate guarantees of free access in respect of certain individual raw materials, whether produced within a colonial territory or not, the raw materials covered to be specified in the course of the enquiry.If the probable objection of the French is not thought to rule it out, theseguarantees in respect of individual raw materials, whether colonial or not, might be coupled with a general guarantee in respect of all raw materials produced in -colonial territories.We repeat, however, that it seems to us more than likely that the above Paragraph 41. proposals may not be regarded by the &quot; starved Powers &quot; as at all a substantial method of meeting the grievances they feel, nor be effective in averting demands for something in the nature of a political redistribution of colonial possessions.The proposal for an enquiry can either be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government Paragraphs in the United Kingdom to the Council or to the Assembly.  We consider these 41alternative methods of procedure, but do not feel competent to express an opinion as to their relative merits, since that depends upon the degree of publicity and urgency which it is desired to give to the enquiry.Whatever the procedure adopted, no terms of reference will be required at Paragraph 47. the first stage.G.

The Relevant Paragraphs of Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s Speech.&quot; I will take as an example the problem of the world&apos;s economic resources and the possibility of making better use of them in the future. Abundant supplies of raw materials appear to give peculiar advantage to the countries possessing them. It is easy to exaggerate the decisive character of such an advantage, for there are countries which, having little or no natural abundance, have yet made themselves prosperous and powerful by industry and trade. Yet the fact remains that some countries, either in their native soil or in their colonial territories, do possess what appear to be preponderant advantages, and that others, less favoured, view the situation with anxiety. Especially as regards colonial raw materials, it is not unnatural that such a state of affairs should give rise to fear lest exclusive monopolies be set up at the expense of those countries that do not possess colonial empires. It is clear that in the view of many this is a real problem. And we should be foolish to ignore it. It may be that it is exaggerated. It may be also that it is exploited for other purposes. None the less, as the question is causing discontent and anxiety, the wise course is to investigate it, to see what the proposals are for dealing with it, to see what is the real scope of the trouble, and if the trouble is substantial, to try to remove it.The view of His Majesty&apos;s Government is that the problem is economic rather than political and territorial. It is the fear of monopoly of the with-holding of essential colonial raw materials that is causing alarm. It is the desire for a guarantee that the distribution of raw materials will not be unfairly impeded that is stimulating the demand for further enquiry. So far as His Majesty&apos;s Government is concerned, I feel sure that we should be ready to take our share in an investigation of these matters.My impression is that there is no question in present circumstances of any colony withholding its raw materials from any prospective purchaser. On the contrary, the trouble is that they cannot be sold at remunerative prices. This side of the question was investigated with concrete results by a Commission of the Monetary and Economic Conference which met in London in 1933. Its work was directed primarily towards raising wholesale prices to a reasonable level through the co-ordination of production and marketing; but one of the stipula-tions of such action was that it should be fair to all parties, both producers and consumers, that it should not aim at discriminating against a particular country, and that it should, as far as possible, be worked with the willing co-operation of consuming interests in importing countries.This precedent may indicate a suitable line of approach to an enquiry which should be limited in this case to raw materials from colonial areas., including protectorates and mandated territories. I suggest that the emphasis in the terms of reference should fall upon free distribution of such raw materials among the industrial countries which require them, so that all fear of exclusion or monopoly may be removed once and for all.The Government that I represent will, I know, be prepared to take their share in any collective attempt to deal in a fair and effective way with a problem that is certainly troubling many people at present and may trouble them even more in the future. Obviously, however, such an enquiry needs calm and dispassionate consideration, and calm and dispassionate consideration is-impossible in an atmosphere of wrar and threatenings of war.&quot;
A Brief Statement of the Extent to ivhich the &quot; Open Door &quot; Exists or does not exist in the British Colonial Empire.I. In Mandated Territories of the A and B classes (to which all United Kingdom, but not the Dominion, mandates belong) the provisions of the Mandate require that there shall be complete economic, commercial and industrial equality between Members of the League. Japan and Germany are now no longer members of the League, but in point of fact there is no discrimination against them in any Mandated Territory.2. In the East African Territories the Congo Basin Treaties prevent discrimination in import duties and in the grant of concessions. They are also held to prevent altogether the imposition of import quotas. The Law Officers&apos; opinion is that there is no way by which these provisions of the Treaties can be obviated, except with the consent of all the parties.3. The Anglo-French Convention of 1898 prevents discrimination in Nigeria and the Gold Coast against French goods, and therefore against the goods of all countries having most-favoured-nation rights in those Territories. Among these countries are Germany and Italy, but not Japan (the application of the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911 to the West African Terri-tories having been terminated in 1934). The French Government have recently given notice that they desire to suspend this particular provision of the Convention and the resulting position is now under consideration.4. There are no discriminatory import duties (except on liquors and tobaccos) in the three important entrepot Colonies, Hong Kong, Straits Settle-ments and Gibraltar. In Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements there are preferential registration fees for British motor cars.5. Elsewhere in the Colonial Empire imperial preferences are in force. They have, of course, been largely extended in recent years as a result of the Ottawa Conference, and their removal would entail a reversal of a major item of imperial policy. In any case such preferences as are guaranteed by the Ottawa Agreements could not be removed before August 1937, which is the earliest date for the termination of those Agreements. No doubt Japan would benefit from any removal of the preferences, especially as certain of the heavy general duties weigh particularly on Japanese goods; on the other hand, there is some evidence to show that Germany and Italy are not much affected by them.6. In the West African Colonies there are special discriminatory duties on some Japanese imports, e.g., articles of apparel, galvanized iron and cement.7. Throughout the greater part of the Colonial Empire other than Mandated Territories and the Congo Basin areas a system of quotas has been introduced on foreign piece-goods made of cotton or rayon. This has been a heavy blow to Japanese trade, but it must, if anything, have been beneficial to Germany and Italy since they are guaranteed freedom from Japanese competition for an amount at least equal to the average of their imports from 1927 to 1931; in free competition with Japan they could hardly have hoped to maintain imports at this level.8. In all parts of the Colonial Empire it is the normal practice for the requirements of Colonial Governments to be obtained through the Crown Agents for the Colonies. It is usual, except in the case of the Mandated Territories, for requirements to be satisfied solely by United Kingdom firms wherever this is possible.9. There is a natural disposition on the part of colonial officials to buy British goods.10. Where assistance is given by the Colonial Development Fund it is the usual practice to stipulate that all expenditure outside the territory assisted shall so far as possible be incurred within the United Kingdom.II. In Palestine and one or two colonial dependencies there are a few duties which are intended to be protective of local industries.[12549]
