THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1936.SECEET. Copy No.CP. 25 (36).CABINET.EGYPTIAN TREATY.Memorandum by the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence.IN accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on Wednesday, the 5th February, 1936 (Cabinet 4 (36), Conclusion 4), the Committee of Imperial Defence met on Thursday, the 6th February, 1936, to consider the military aspects of an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. They had before them a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 1212?B), which is attached to this-Memorandum.The Political Aspects.2. The political aspects of the question were presented to the Committee by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the following effect: 3. By the declaration of 1922, His Majesty&apos;s Government recognised Egypt to be an independent Sovereign State, subject to four points which were reserved, and the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government since that date had been to seek agree-ment in respect of these reserved points. Several attempts at agreement had been unsuccessful, but the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government had never been abandoned, and Egypt was justified in expecting that this policy still held good. The present position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Egypt was anomalous. By exercising various rights under the reserved points, we infringed the full sovereignty of Egypt, and we did so by virtue of the unilateral declaration of 1922, the validity of which might be challengeable in international law.In view of the paramount importance of our Imperial communications and the vulnerability of the Suez Canal, it was essential that our position in Egypt should be regularized. Egypt had never recognised the declaration of 1922, nor had foreign Governments. Therefore it was possible that some foreign Power might raise the question of the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Egypt and of the presence of their troops before the Council of the League of Nations, with or without the connivance of Egypt, and an awkward situation might arise under Article XI of the Covenant.In addition, there was the question of Egypt&apos;s desire for membership, of the League of Nations. It was possible that her claim might be resisted on the grounds that, owing to the reserved points, she had not the requisite status, but it would be difficult to argue this question before the League when countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Abyssinia were members. In fact, we had allowed Egypt to send an observer to the League of Nations during the present Italo-Abyssinian dispute. So long as she was not a member she could not bring us before an international court under the optional clause, but when she became a member she might bring the matter of the Sudan before the Hague Court, and could also take us to the Council of the League. This she had threatened to do in 1930.Our position in Egypt, therefore, without a Treaty was weak and dangerous,, and the delay in negotiating a Treaty had increased nationalist feeling.   One of [12694] B
the difficulties hitherto had been to obtain a negotiable Government in Egypt. Now there was a national Government, and the present moment was opportune for negotiation because of Egyptian fear of Italian aggression. The Egyptians were, therefore, willing to reconsider the military clauses of the 1930 Treaty and within certain bounds were expected to be more accommodating and reasonable. We were in an unsatisfactory political position in Egypt. We did not govern the country, we had no Mandate, but bore a measure of responsibility for its Governments actions. So long as British troops remained in Cairo we were the buffer between His Majesty King Fuad and the Egyptian people.The whole of the Chiefs of Staff paper had been based on the importance of securing the goodwill of Egypt, with which view the Foreign Office were in entire agreement. The Foreign Office were, however, equally confident that if the terms of this paper were the minimum that could be accepted, no Treaty would be possible; and that if we were to offer them as a minimum then we should rally all shades of Egyptian opinion against us and create a position where we could only hold Egypt by force of arms, against that Nation&apos;s will.The Military Aspects.3. The Committee then discussed the conclusions of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee as set forth in paragraph (39) of the attached Report. The results of this discussion are set fortji below. For convenience of reference the recom-mendation of the Chiefs of Staff Committee on each point is as quoted.(1) General.(a) It must be made clear beyond all possibility of doubt in any future treatythat His- Majesty&apos;s Government do in fact possess the right to reinforce Egypt with naval, military and air forces, and to ta,ke any steps necessary to protect vital strategic interests in an apprehended emergency and not only on the outbreak of war.4. In the vieAv of the Committee of Imperial Defence the governing consideration is that the basis of the Treaty must be an alliance founded on goodwill on both sides. They accept, in principle, the view of the Chiefs of Staff Committee as set forth above, though the actual wording is inappropriate for use in a negotiation. Moreover, the question is linked up with the decisions taken as to the number and location of the troops in Egypt. If the numbers of troops to be stationed in Egypt in normal times are not restricted in a future Treaty, it should be comparatively simple to obtain these conditions. It is important, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be the sole judges of what constitutes an apprehended emergency.(b) The role of the British forces in Egypt is immutable and cannot logicallybe subject to any time limit or be a matter for submission to the League of Nations as was envisaged in the 1930 Draft Treaty.5. While this condition is of the first importance from the point of view of Imperial Defence, its implementation is very difficult to reconcile with an eventual Egyptian membership of the League of Nations which would enable Egypt to bring the matter before the League under Article XIX of the Covenant. This, it is true, would only be possible with the consent of both parties to the Treaty, but in practice it might be very difficult for a British Government to resist a proposal by Egypt to refer the question to the League of Nations. In the Draft Treaty of 1930 it was sought to overcome this difficulty by the inclusion of a time limit of twenty years within which the question would not be raised. A time limit, however, is but a dubious and temporary safeguard, and itself is open to later challenge by Egypt under Article XIX of the Covenant.6. The Committee of Imperial Defence recommend that the British negotiators should not themselves propose a time limit, and if it is proposed from the other side they should oppose it. On this point, again, the real safeguard is to be found in a Treaty based on mutual goodwill.
(c) That the non-military clauses should not be separated from the military clauses since these are interdependent; for example, a British element in the police and in the Egyptian Government is a corollary to British forces remaining in the cities of Egypt.7. The Committee of Imperial Defence recommend that the question of a British element in the Police should take a high place among the desiderata aimed at by the negotiators when discussing the non-military clauses, but the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs entered a caveat that he cannot guarantee that this point will be secured. The Committee of Imperial Defence consider this point, though not absolutely essential, as very desirable, and that, in any event, np&apos; foreign element, other than British, should be admitted to the Police (see also (e) )-(d) That His Majesty&apos;s Government must remain exclusively responsible forthe security of the Suez Canal; no right to participate in this responsibility should be conceded to the Egyptian Government.8. The Committee recommend that this point should not be specifically raised in the negotiations for a Treaty, but our responsibility for the security of the Suez Canal should be assumed; .(e) That it must be recognised that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot evadethe responsibility in the last resort for the protection of foreign interests, and that no Treaty can absolve them from this responsibility.9. Both this point and point (c) above, to a lesser extent raise the question of the responsibility for the maintenance of order in Egypt in the last resort. The Committee of Imperial Defence recommend that instead of dealing with this point in the Treaty, the negotiators should endeavour to secure an exchange of Notes providing that the responsibility for the maintenance of order remains with the Egyptian Government, but that in the event of military support to the civil power being required from outside Egyptian resources, they should invite help by British forces and British forces only.(/) If it is considered inevitable, for political reasons, that there should be some limitation on peace-time strengths, the limitation will have to be a high one, in order to guard against the possibility of finding ourselves in an unfavourable military situation owing to some sudden and unforeseen development in either internal Or external affairs! Furthermore, the treaty should contain some provision for increasing-the strength of the peace-time garrison at some future date, if the; trend of events indicates that such an increase is necessary.10. The Committee of Imperial Defence recommend the first sentence for acceptance. If, as is hoped, no limit is placed on the number of British troops being retained in Egypt, the question raised in the second sentence does not arise.(g) That the immunities and privileges in jurisdictional and fiscal matters to-be enjoyed by the British forces in Egypt be safeguarded.11.   The Committee of Imperial Defence recommend acceptance.(h) That the armament and equipment of the Egyptian forces are not to-differ in type from those of the British forces. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to use their good offices to facilitate the supply of such armament and equipment, and in return the Egyptian Government to accept ah increased number of British personnel with the Egyptian Forces.12. The Committee of Imperial Defence approve this recommendation but point out once more that it is a point that depends on the acceptance of good-will as the basis of the Treaty. ,(i) No foreign instructors other than British shall be employed in the^Egyptian forces, and the Egyptian Government shall not send personnel of their armed forces to be trained abroad elsewhere than in the United Kingdom.13. The remarks on (A) above apply to this recommendation also. The negotiators should be insti-ucted to secure this condition.[12694] b 2
(2) Military.(a) That the right to keep British troops in the present locations in Cairoshould be retained. (&amp;) That the right to place troops in or to the west of Alexandria shouldbe agreed to.(c) That the number of troops to be stationed in Egypt in normal times to be a matter for discussion between the two countries when the existing international situation has become stable.14. This paragraph is the crux of the whole Treaty. The right to keep British troops in their present locations in Cairo, on which the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee insist from a military point of view, presents difficulties which are regarded by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and by his advisers in Egypt as ruling out all prospect of a Treaty.15. The proposal of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is that the negotiators should endeavour to secure the right to station troops (i) in the east, on the Suez Canal;(ii) in the west for the defence of the western frontier at, or preferably near, Alexandria;(iii) at Helouan, ten miles south of Cairo, where there is an aerodrome.This is the maximum which they thought that the Egyptian Government might be induced to accept, and then only with the utmost difficulty. The minimum would be (i) and (ii) without (iii).16. The Chiefs of Staff do not regard this solution as a sound one from sl military point of view. They deem it necessary- more especially owing to the new threat that has developed from Libya to hold military forces at Cairo as sl central point from which they could be used for the defence either of the Suez Canal, or of the western frontier, according to need. They attach great importance to the occupation of the Citadel in Cairo owing to the presence there of a magazine which serves the Egyptian army as well as the British army. Occupation of the Citadel is an important safeguard against disaffection by the Egyptian army, such as has occurred in the past, and British occupation is a guarantee both to the Egyptian King and Government, and to our own safety. They warn the Govern-ment that to leave Cairo involves grave risks, and that if it takes place our Imperial responsibilities may be endangered. If, however, this course should be unavoidable, they regard the maintenance of the existing barracks at Abbassia, in the suburbs of Cairo, and Helmieh as the minimum consistent with safety. They much dislike on military grounds a station such as Helouan south of Cairo.17. A position to the north of Cairo, such as that of Abbassia and Helmieh, is strategically better than one south of the City. Moreover, facilities for contact and co-operation would there be much better than at Helouan, and it would be much cheaper for the Egyptian Government to make use of existing barracks at Abbassia, &amp;c, than to make a completely new military station at Helouan.18. The decision, therefore, turns on a balance of risks between not having &amp; Treaty at all (with all that that implies in a continuance of present vexations and unrest and the political considerations referred to above in paragraph 2), or of having a Treaty which involves grave military risks.19. The point is reserved for Cabinet decision. In order to assist the Cabinet the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has undertaken to telegraph to Sir Miles Lampson to ascertain his view. In addition, the Secretary of State for War has invited the Director of Military Operations and Intelligence, who is on leave in Egypt, to examine whether there is an alternative site to those referred to above, near Cairo; but, as this question was examined by the military -authorities in 1933, the prospects of finding a satisfactory alternative site are not deemed good.,(3) Air.(a) Limitation of Strength. It may be practicable, from the point of view of air defence, to agree to a peace-time figure of 400 pilots and the necessary ancillary personnel. (This was the limitation figure mentioned in the 1933 draft.)   While international relations remain
disturbed as they are to-day, it appears inevitable that the British air forces in Egypt should be maintained at a greater strength than was formerly the case. Although it is thought that the necessary increases, so far as they can be foreseen, can be effected without exceeding the limitation figure in the 1933 draft, that is not to say, however, that the principle of permanent limitation is acceptable.. (b) Location of Permanent A ir Bases.-The actual peace-time location of the British air units permanently stationed, in Egypt must depend to some extent on the agreed location of our land forces. Nevertheless, the speed and range of modern aircraft and the comparatively limited size of modern Egypt are such that the question of the exact situation of the air bases to be occupied in times of peace, is not of primary importance provided that the considerations mentioned below are fulfilled.      &apos;20. The question of the location of the British air forces in Egypt is inevitably bound up with the location of the units of the army. The Committee of Imperial Defence were informed that if the aerodrome at Heliopolis had to be given up, Helouan in any case would not be suitable for a large air force. The air force units from Heliopolis in that case might have to go to Alexandria or elsewhere. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed that, provided units of the army were stationed near Cairo, it was of lesser importance where the air forces would be.(c) Freedom of Flight. It is vital that our air forces should have freedom of flight, both for training and operational purposes, over the whole of Egyptian territory, and that landing grounds and maintenance facilities should be available for their use wherever and whenever required. This requirement involves the right to visit and inspect&apos; aerodromes and landing grounds as often as may be considered necessary to ensure that they are maintained in a satisfactory condition for use in an emergency. A very brief review of our &apos; defensive commitments will show that there are few populated areas-in Egypt, and few desert regions, where adequate facilities for air operations might not be required at short notice.To meet (i) An Italian threat from Libya, we should require air facilities in North-West and Western Egypt, particularly in the coastal region.(ii) A threat to our Mediterranean sea communications or across the Eastern Mediterranean, we  should require similar  facilities, along the whole of the Northern coast of Egypt and the Sinai Peninsula. - .(iii) A threat to our Red Sea communications, we should require air.facilities in South-Eastern Egypt, flanking the Gulf of Suez and the Red Sea. The use of adequate aerodromes, landing grounds and seaplane anchorages in this area would also be essential as an alternative air route to India and the Far East, via Aden, should conditions in Iraq at any time prevent the safe operation of the Bagdad route.To secure (iv) Our Imperial air routes, we need adequate facilities for the :operation of both civil and military aircraft in the vicinity, of Cairo; throughout the whole length of the Nile Valley; from the,; Western frontier via Alexandria and Cairo to the Canal Zone. en route to Gaza, Akaba or Port Sudan. The use of the Nile route is also necessary to assist in securing our rail, river and air communications with the Sudan, in the event of Italian aggression from Eritrea or Libya. v;(v) The Suez Canal, we:need full facilities in the vicinity of the Canal - Zone and the Sinai Peninsula. ,     -
It is thus apparent that, without complete freedom of movement for our air forces, and without the right to ensure that all facilities for their operation are available and protected wherever they may be required in an emergency, we shall not be in a position to secure our own interests, or to undertake the defence of Egypt itself against external aggression.21. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed that it was essential that we should be free to locate landing grounds and air facilities in whatever quarter might be necessary in order to meet our dangers which might come from many directions. Provided, however, that a treaty could be concluded on the basis of an alliance, no particular difficulties in obtaining such rights need be anticipated. With regard to the use of the Nile route, the Committee of Imperial Defence agreed that it is essential to obtain the use of the necessary staging points on this line in order to be able to secure our communications with the Sudan.  .(4) Additional Considerations.It is suggested that in an Annex to the Treaty the following should be dealt with :-(a) Censorship;(6) An agreement to continue to co-operate to prevent any mutual inter-ference between Egyptian W/T Stations and those of the British Forces in Egypt;:    (c) The establishment of Martial Law in the Canal Zone when necessary; (d) Restrictions on foreign aircraft crossing the Canal Zone and the institution of a corridor.22. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed that an understanding on these four points is desirable, and every attempt should be made by the negotiators to obtain the necessary agreement.(Initialled) SB.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, February 7, 1936.o

The matter has been examined accordingly, but we thought it would be convenient if the views expressed were co-ordinated and presented by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.We have therefore prepared and submit the attached report.(Signed)      A. A. MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD. E. L. ELLINGTON. W. M. JAMES (for C.N.S.).2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, February 5, 1936.ENCLOSURE.Review of the situation.IN 1922 Egypt was declared by His Majesty&apos;s Government to be an indepen-dent sovereign State, subject to four points, which were absolutely reserved to the discretion of His Majesty&apos;s Government until such time as it might be possible to conclude agreement in regard to them.The four points were :- (i) The security of the communications of the British Empire in Egypt, (ii) The defence of Egypt against foreign aggression.(iii) The protection of foreign interests in Egypt.(iv) The Sudan.During the past decade there have been several attempts to reach an agree-ment on the above points, and to conclude a treaty with Egypt, but they have all broken down for one reason or another. A brief outline of these negotiations is given in C.I.D. Paper No. 1114-B.The 1930 Draft Treaty.2.   The draft 1930 Treaty was first reviewed by the Chiefs of Staff in July 1929 (OLD. Paper No. 957-B).   The draft provided for the withdrawal of the [12679] B
British garrison to localities to be agreed upon to the east of longitude 32DE. (i.e., in the Canal Zone). The Chiefs of Staff stated their opinion that, so far as the defence of our Imperial communications was concerned, this provision involved the abandonment of a position which was strategically sound for one that was much inferior; no reduction of the garrison would probably be possible; the British forces would no longer be in a position to protect the lives and property of foreign nationals in Egypt outside the Canal Zone. The objections of the Chiefs of Staff were not upheld by the Cabinet, which decided to offer to the Egyptians the withdrawal of the garrison to the east of longitude 320E. (i.e., in the Canal Zone), and this provision was included in the published proposals for an Anglo-Egyptian settlement.3. In 1930 an Egyptian delegation led by Nahas Pasha came to London to negotiate on these proposals. After lengthy discussion they eventually agreed that: (a) The British forces should be concentrated in the Canal Zone with aview to ensuring, in co-operation with the Egyptian forces, the defence of the Canal;(b) The Royal Air Force depot would be transferred from Aboukir to PortFuad;(c) After twenty years the question whether the Egyptian Army was ableto ensure by its own resources the liberty and entire security of navigation in the Canal was to be submitted to the League of Nations if the two Governments failed to agree on this point.These provisions were contingent on agreement being reached with the Egyptians on various important points, which included the question of numbers of land forces and air forces, the adequacy of the area contemplated, the provision of training grounds, water supply and amenities, and freedom of movement for service aircraft. The Secretaries of State for War and Air at the time were members of the British Delegation during these negotiations, and discussed the service provisions direct with the Egyptian delegates.Chiefs of Staff objections to 1930 Draft Treaty.4. Subsequent to the breakdown of the negotiations in 1930, wherein agree-ment was reached on all points except the Sudan, the Chiefs of Staff presented a Report in which they pointed out that the British negotiators, by disregarding, or without seeking, the advice of the Chiefs of Staff, had agreed to several provisions which were most undesirable from a military point of view. These were as follows : (a) The British garrison of Cairo and Alexandria were to be removed to the Canal Zone.(6) The co-operation of the Egyptian Army with the British Forces in the defence of the Canal was accepted. The possibility of the Egyptian Army eventually being able to defend the Canal Zone alone was envisaged.: . (c) The ultimate removal of all British forces from Egypt after twenty years was to be a matter for negotiation or submission to the League of Nations.(d) A numerical limit was to be placed on the strength of the British land and air forces which the British Government were to be authorised to maintain on Egyptian soil.In addition, the. Egyptian delegation had made a proposal, which the British Delegation had not accepted before the negotiations broke down,.in which certain restrictions were to be placed on the freedom of movements of British aircraft between the Canal Zone a,nd the countries south, east and west of Egypt.5 The Chiefs of Staff recognised that political considerations might necessitate the acceptance of (a), (b) and (c), but they deemed it their duty to draw the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the implications of these proposals; as regards (d) and the proposal to restrict British aircraft, they considered these to be unjustifiable concessions.
[12679]* C.I.D. Paper No. 1114-B.6. In 1932, in Paper No. A.E.T. 8, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in order to avoid the removal of troops from the Cairo area, suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government might offer to withdraw the two battalions from Cairo and the one battalion from Alexandria, and retain only one of them either at Abbasia or Helmieh, thus reducing the British garrison by two battalions. In 1932 a reduction in the garrison of Egypt was possible, but in view of the changed inter-national situation no reduction of British Forces can now be considered, and, in fact, it may be necessary to increase their number over the normal garrison when the international situation becomes stabilised.The 1933 Draft Treaty.7. When Sidky Pasha became Prime Minister in June 1930, the Foreign Office formed the impression, after some months, that the stability of his position was such that the time was opportune to resume negotiations for an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. Eventually the Foreign Secretary, circulated to the Cabinet a paper (CP. 109 (33) )* on the treaty negotiations with Egypt. This paper included a draft treaty with connected notes. The gist of the Articles directly affecting the Services was as follows : -Article 8. Egyptian Army.British personnel to be withdrawn and the functions of the Inspector-General and his staff to terminate.Such foreign military instructors as the Egyptian Government deem necessary to be British subjects.Egypt to accept a British Military Mission and abstain from sending personnel to foreign countries for training.Armament and equipment to be of British pattern.Article 9. Location of Troops.This Article draws attention to the fact that the Suez Canal and adjacent territories furnish an essential artery of all forms of communication between the different parts of the British Empire (the permanent maintenance and protection of which is in the common interest of both contracting parties), and authorises His Britannic Majesty to maintain upon Egyptian territory in, localities in the vicinity of the Canal such forces as he considers necessary to ensure the protec-tion of this artery of communication. An annexe to this Article includes the following points :--(a) British troops to be located east of parallel 32 and to be distributed between Port Said (Port detachment only), Moascar and the Geneifa area on the south-west side of the Great Bitter Lake as regards the land forces; and as regards the air forces, between Abu Sueir, Ismalia, Moascar, the Nefisha area, and an area to the north end of the Great Bitter Lake west of the Canal, with emergency landing grounds at Port Fuad and Kantara, near Suez, Romani and the El Hemeire Tower on the Cairo-Suez road, seaplane moorings and facilities at Port Said and Suez, and a practice camp in the desert west of the northern extremity of the Great Bitter Lake on the line 32Q 10&apos;.(b) British troops to be restricted in numbers (except when there is a menaceof imminent danger of war or internal disturbance in British terri-tories or territories adjacent thereto, or in the event of threat to Britain&apos;s essential communications), to 8,000 (or 10,500 if troops are all moved to the Canal) land forces, and 400 air pilots, with the necessary ancillary personnel.(c) Provision of barracks suitable according to modern standards, and reasonable amenities by the Egyptian Government.(d) Above accommodation to be provided for a maximum of 8,000 army personnel and 2,624 air personnel, the plans and estimates being-drawn up by the British Government.(e) When the works are complete and the cost defrayed, British forces inother parts of the country will withdraw therefrom and the barracks and lands, unless privately owned, will be handed over to the Egyptian G overnment.
(/) Any differences relating to the execution of (c), (d) and (e) above to be submitted to an arbitral board.(g) The British and Egyptians to enjoy reciprocal flying facilities, includingcomplete freedom of movement for British military aircraft on service occasions over Egyptian territory.(h) Other points refer to a restriction on foreign aircraft flying over the canal Zone-jurisdictional and fiscal privileges for British personnel  provision of communications to localities occupied by British troops and arrangements to prevent interference with British radio-telegraphy.Differences between 1933 Draft and 1930 proposals.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that this draft differed from the 1930 proposals in that it envisaged the following modifications: (a) Far-reaching revisions of the areas to be allotted to the British forceswithin the Canal Zone.(b) Abolition in the event of war, threat of war or serious disturbance withinthe Empire or in adjacent territories, of the restriction on the numbers of the British land and air forces to be maintained in Egypt.(c) Provision of the absolute freedom of movement of British service aircraft.(d) Egypt&apos;s assistance as an ally (use of ports, aerodromes, means ofcommunication, &amp;c.) to be available not merely in time of war, but also in event of internal disturbance within the Empire.(e) The jurisdictional and fiscal immunities to be negotiated in a separate agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Egyptian Government.Chiefs of Staff Objections to 1933 Draft Treaty.9. In May 1933, the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee submitted a Report* (Paper No. C.O.S. 309) on the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper.   This Report (a) reiterated the need for depth to ensure the defence of the Canal.(b) pointed out that plans for attempts to commit acts of sabotage on the canal would be hatched in Cairo, as also would plans for engineering internal unrest. The presence of British troops in or near Cairo would be a powerful deterrent to both.(c) expressed alarm at the prospect of British control being removed fromthe Egyptian Army and Air Force, and quoted the Arabi Revolt, 1881-82.(d) pointed out that, in the event of an attack from the east of the Canal,. our communications must be secure. This would not be possible unless we held Cairo.(e) suggested that, in the event of unrest in Cairo, and British troops being in the Canal Zone, other foreign powers might despatch troops to , quell the trouble.(/) did not consider the location of troops in Cairo as essential to the securityof the Sweet Water Canal. (g) pointed out that there was no position suitable for location of troopsbetween Cairo and the Canal Zone.Foreign Office reply to Chiefs of Staff.10. In June 1933, the Foreign Secretary replied to this report in a memorandum,! CP. 152 (33). He said that the presence of British troops in Cairo was a potential cause of unrest as well as a guarantee for its suppression. He also pointed out that the security of our rear in the.event of hostilities on the Eastern Front was adequately guaranteed by the Treaty Articles.* C.I.D. Paper No. 1114-B, page 19. f C.I.D. Paper No. 1114-B, page 24.
Cabinet Decision, July 1933.11. In July 1933, the Cabinet decided, inter alia (C.I.D. Paper 1114-B), that:  (a) At the moment it is undesirable to make any communication to the Egyptian Government on the subject of the proposed Treaty negotiations :* * * * *(c) That, in agreeing to negotiations next year, notwithstanding the state-ment of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that &apos;&apos; there is no prospect whatever, in my view, of the present or any Egyptian Government accepting any Treaty which maintains the British Troops in or near Cairo &quot; (CP. 152 (33)), the Cabinet are in no way committed to a decision in favour of removing the troops from the neighbourhood of Cairo:(d) That, whenever a communication on the subject has to be made to theEgyptian Government, it would be inadvisable, in the first stage, to warn them of the special difficulties likely to arise in connection with the Sudan and the stations for the British troops :* * *      &apos; * -   *Present Situation.12. The trend of world events since 1933 affords no grounds for modification of the basic advice reiterated by the Chiefs of Staff in Paper No. CCS. 309. It is, however, opportune to examine afresh the military aspect of an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, with a view to determining what are our essential military needs under present conditions.Role of the British Forces in Egypt.13. The role of the British Forces in Egypt on conclusion of a treaty should be (a) Defence of our Essential Empire Communications.(b) The protection of Egypt against external aggression.   (In co-operationwith the Egyptian Forces.)(c) The protection of foreign interests in Egypt.This role is immutable, and should not be made subject to any time limit or be a matter for submission to the League of Nations with a view to this responsibility being taken over by the Egyptian Forces. Such conditions were provided in the 1930 draft Treaty, but omitted from the Treaty drafted in 1933, the point having been raised by the Chiefs of Staff in their Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 1011-B) of the 30th July, 1933. As regards (a) and (b), the following extract from CP. 6 (36) is apposite :  &quot; Recent events have thrown into clearer light the vital importance of Egypt from the strategic aspect, and have emphasized if emphasis were needed the vital necessity of our insuring that the military provisions of a comprehensive treaty settlement with Egypt must be such as to ensure that the defence of Egypt and of our Imperial communications is absolutely assured for the future.&quot;Defence of our Essential Empire Communications: General.14. Our requirements in Egypt to enable us to defend our essential Empire communications can be divided generally into those which should be available in normal times of peace and those which we must have in war or emergency. Our main essential communications are the Suez Canal and our Air Routes to Africa and the East.   In a despatch from the Foreign Office to the High Commissioner
in Egypt, dated the 7th October, 1934 (C.I.D. Paper No. 520-B), it was stated that &quot;It is no less true to-day than in 1922 that the security of the communications of -the British Empire in Egypt remain a vital British interest, and that absolute certainty that the Suez Canal will remain open in peace as well as in war for the free despatch of British ships is the foundation on which the entire defensive strategy of the British Empire rests.&quot;The trend of world events since 1934 affords no grounds for modification of this statement. On the contrary, recent international developments emphasize more than ever before the vital importance of the Snez Canal and in consequence the potential danger of any policy which weakens our hold upon it. In view of this and alarmed by the vulnerability of the Canal under existing political conditions, the Chiefs of Staff investigated the question in 1934, and in C.I.D. Paper No. 1137-B reported &quot; that after a careful review of all the circumstances we have reached the conclusion that the safety not only of our own interests, but of those of all countries users of the Canal can only be guaranteed by our assuming entire responsibility for the control of the Canal at whatever time may seem to us desirable.&quot;15. The whole of our Far Eastern security depends on the mobility of the Fleet. Failing drastic action on our part during strained international relations, an attempt to block the Canal would probably succeed. The effect of a block would be so serious that the Committee of Imperial Defence have accepted the policy of force majeure, and at the 267th Meeting on the 18th December, 1934, they approved of the recommendations made by the Chiefs of Staff for the defence of the Suez Canal against blocking attack and sabotage, and authorized the Service Departments to consider what measures were necessary in order that the recommendations.might be put into effect. A Suez Canal Defence Plan has there-fore been prepared. It depends for its success on absolute secrecy in preparation and unchallenged power in execution. Such vital secret plans cannot be shared with Egypt. There can be no question of Egyptian troops being placed in any position in which they might have a legal right to participate in defensive measures which we may find it necessary to adopt at a time of grave emergency. It may be found desirable to ask for certain assistance from Egyptian troops, for example, in the plan, the co-operation of certain Frontiers Administration Forces in Sinai is envisaged. But the Chiefs of Staff cannot concur in any proposal which would concede to the Egyptians any rights or privileges in the defence of the Suez Canal.Military Implications.16. An effective military defence of the Suez Canal can be secured only by having depth to the Canal defences. Should the Canal have to be defended as an operation of war, it is essential that Egypt should not be in a position to attack with land and air forces from the West, British troops defending the Canal. This danger can be safeguarded only by the domination of Cairo, which will be the source of all plots against our interests. In calculating the number of British troops required for the protection of Imperial communications, it must also be remembered that geographically Egypt is an excellent location for a small strategic reserve. Although in the past the strength of the British garrison has not been calculated on the basis of its liability to send troops elsewhere in emergency, actually when the situation in Egypt has been quiet, troops have been spared temporarily for service outside Egypt. In future the most important commitment of the garrison of Egypt in this respect will be its contribution to the plan for the despatch of army reinforcements to Iraq should an emergency arise and the Royal Air Force ask for military aid. Reinforcements from Egypt are also envisaged in the local defence schemes for Aden, Palestine, Cyprus, Sudan and the South Persian Oilfields.Naval Implications.17. So far as the Navy is concerned, the possibility of demanding from Egypt the right to establish any form of base at Alexandria in time of peace must be ruled out (even if it were desirable for other reasons) in view of the recent
assurance on this subject given to the Egyptian orovernment by the Foreign Office. (Foreign Office Telegram No. 438 attached as Appendix &quot;A.&quot;) With regard to war or emergency, it is essential that we should have the facilities provided for in the 1933 Draft Treaty (and largely in the 1930 draft), i.e., in the event of war we should have Egypt&apos;s assistance as an Ally, thus giving us the right to make full use of her ports, means of communication, &amp;c. These facilities and assistance also to be available in the event of imminent menace of war or of serious disturbance within the territories under the sovereignty or authority of His Britannic Majesty or territories adjacent thereto, or in the event of a threat to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s essential communications.Air Implications.18. In addition to the air defence of Egypt and the Suez Canal, the British Air Forces in Egypt are responsible for the local defence, and in some respects the maintenance, of our essential Imperial air communications. These are the routes across the Mediterranean to Egypt; through Palestine and Trans-Jordan to Iraq, India and the Far East; via the Red Sea to Port Sudan and Aden; and the Nile route to South, East and West Africa. A further commit-ment is the protection of our sea communications in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea, in co-operation with the Navy. The Air Forces in Egypt also form, in part, an air reserve available for despatch to any territories on these routes. The size of this reserve is therefore governed by conditions outside Egypt and an increase is already overdue. The climatic conditions and/or political considerations in neighbouring territories make them unsuitable as alternative locations for this reserve.The Protection of Egypt agaist External Aggression (in co-operation with the Egyptian Forces): General.19. The forces which we must maintain and the rights we must possess in Egypt to enable us to defend our essential communications will in the main serve to protect Egypt against external aggression. Since the Treaty was last considered, however, an entirely new situation has arisen on the Western frontier. Until recently the possibility of attack on Egypt from this direction has been regarded as remote; consequently the strength of the British forces required to deal with this contingency must be a factor in calculating the garrison. To-day Italy&apos;s strength in Libya constitutes a definite threat to Egypt. It would be premature to forecast the outcome of present events, but our plans must be based on the possibility of a hostile Italy. The Egyptian Forces are not capable of undertaking the defence of Egypt against a first-class military power. It is obvious, therefore, that under any Treaty, Britain must remain primarily responsible for the defence of Egypt against external aggression, and that the British Forces in Egypt must henceforth be in a position, not only as regards their strength but also as regards their location, to meet any Italian threat from Libya.Military Implications.20. The greatest safeguard to the security of Egypt against invasion would be the re-organisation of the Egyptian Army, and a close connection of the Egyptian and British Armies so that they can be regarded as one force to meet external aggression. Recent events have shown the Egyptian authorities the dangers to which they are exposed. The realization of this danger and the collaboration which has taken place between the two forces in joint garrisons in the Western Desert would appear to have produced in Egypt a political outlook which is not wholly unfavourable to a policy of combining Egyptian military aspirations with British Imperial security. The British troops should not be regarded as an Army of occupation; on the contrary, every effort must be made to return to the cordial relationship which existed between the two armies before 1914. The improvement and modernization of the Egyptian Army could be regarded with equanimity provided that a British military mission exercised that measure of influence which would certainly remain in their hands for some time owing to Egyptian lack of qualities of leadership and above all if the British and Egyptian forces were regarded as one force to meet the foreign
threat The expense and difficulties of training armoured forces and anti-aircraft units would probably prevent the Egyptians from providing complete units of these arms, though they may wish for reasons of amour propre to provide a small proportion.21. The vulnerability of her sea communications to Libya and the scarcity of water in the Western Desert of Egypt are limiting factors which would preclude ambitious Italian operations against Egypt without considerable preparation. Should Italy attack Egypt at the outset of a campaign, her operations would, probably take the form of air offensives against military objectives in Lower Egypt, and perhaps raids by mechanized columns. Such operations would probably synchronize with internal disturbances fermented by Italians in Egypt. To counter the air threat, it is essential that the Royal Air Force should be able to operate from advanced landing grounds in Western Egypt,22. It is thus evident that the British forces in Egypt in future must comprise a proportion of A.F.V.S and mobile troops, but it is premature to attempt to estimate the strength of the force required. These troops must be located so as to protect Western Egypt, i.e.; either in or near Alexandria or west of that port. These troops must also be disposed so as to afford protection to the Royal Air Force bases. From the point of security it is preferable that the air bases should not be in the immediate vicinity of large towns. But the difficulties of water supply in Western Egypt may make it necessary to establish any garrison in or near Alexandria.23. It is necessary to. consider here the question of coast defences at Alexandria. Alexandria is classified as a Category &quot; C &quot; Port, and in normal times two coast defence guns and two searchlights are earmarked for despatch to the port in event of an emergency. At present time the presence of the Fleet at Alexandria increases considerably the importance of the port, and additional coast defences have been temporarily installed by the Navy. It is considered that it would be unwise to establish permanent defences in Alexandria as it seems probable that the Egyptians would demand to take them over under the Treaty, and it is considered inadvisable that these defences should be in Egyptian control. The most satisfactory plan would appear to be to leave Alexandria as a Category &quot; C &quot; port, and to hold at Malta, in peace, guns and lights ready to be installed as quickly as possible in an emergency.t 24. Another factor of considerable importance is the location of head-quarters and reserves. Threat of invasion from the West will always be combined with a threat to the Suez Canal. From the point of view of a central location, communications and liaison with the Egyptian authorities, the vicinity of Cairo appears to be the only suitable location for headquarters and reserves.Air Implications.25. Ismailia is approximately 430 miles from the nearest point of the Libyan frontier, and, for that reason, air attack from Libya could not be satisfactorily countered by British air forces operating from the canal zone. As already stated in paragraph 16, aerodromes, or landing grounds, in North-West Egypt would be required. These would have to be equipped with adequate facilities for refuelling, rearming and effecting minor repairs. Moreover, these facilities would have to be available in peace, since there might be insufficient time to instal them in the period of strained relations, even if preparatory work of that description at such a time were not forbidden on the score of provocation.26. Lacking such facilities, our air forces would be working under disadvantageous conditions which might well prove decisive. It may ultimately be found essential to station British air forces in North-West Egypt; although this will to some extent depend upon the strength of the Italian air dispositions in Libya after the solution of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, and upon the relations which then exist between Great Britain and Italy. A Treaty of a permanent or long-term nature cannot take into account factors so liable to change. It must be based on the premise of the &quot; worst case.&quot;27. The Egyptian Air Force is not now, and can never be, capable of resisting unaided an attack by the air force of a European Power, such as Italy. It is, therefore, in the interests of the Egyptian Government to allow the British
Air Force every facility necessary for resisting external aggression, and to ensure that the Egyptian Air Force is equipped and efficient to co-operate effectually with our own in this duty.28. Although an attack from Italian Libya is the most probable form of external aggression to which Egypt is now exposed, it is also necessary to consider the possible reorientation of the British air forces in Egypt to meet contingencies which are at present more remote; such as air attack from Europe, or air, and possibly land, attack through Asia Minor.Naval Implications.29. To enable the Navy to assist in the protection of Egypt against external aggression it is essential that we should have full use of Alexandria and other Egyptian ports whenever we need them. If the Army and Air Force maintain establishments in the.western desert it will be essential for their sea communica-tions with Sollum and Mersa Matruh to be kept open in times of war or emergency. This requirement provides a further reason why it is essential for our right to use Alexandria and other Egyptian ports in these circumstances to be maintained.The protection of Foreign interests in Egypt: General.30. The protection of foreign interests in Egypt and the protection of minorities was a reserved point in 1922. The situation in Egypt has since that date been that the British are not primarily responsible for the maintenance of internal order; that is the duty of the Egyptian Government, who act through the Civil Police supported by the Egyptian Army. Should a situation arise when it appears necessary for the British forces to intervene, the decision as to their intervention rests with the High Commissioner. Thus it is only in the last resort that His Majesty&apos;s Government have been responsible for internal security in Egypt. In the 1930 and 1933 treaty proposals, however, this ultimate responsibility was given up. In the opinion of the Chiefs of Staff, so long as His Majesty&apos;s Government maintain troops on Egyptian soil, is responsible for the security of the Suez Canal and is regarded as the Power with the greatest interests in Egypt, the responsibility in the last resort for the protection of foreign interests must remain with the British forces, and no treaty can therefore absolve us from this responsibility.31. The Chiefs of Staff have always considered that it is improbable that the Egyptian administration, unsupported by British forces, will be able to ensure the safety of foreign interests. For fifty years the one constant and dependable factor in Egypt has been the British, it is entirely due to their presence, detach-ment and efficiency that the peace of Egypt has been so little disturbed during the last thirteen years of parliamentary government. In the Foreign Office memorandum (OP. 215 (34)) dated the 19th September, 1934, it was stated that the Egyptian police, particularly in the provinces, were inefficient and discontented.  The memorandum then continued : &apos;&apos; If this force fails to maintain order, the obligation resting upon His Majesty&apos;s Government to protect foreign lives and property in Egypt will compel the use of British troops for the restoration and maintenance of order and here it may be mentioned that, should we evince any hesitation in meeting our responsibilities in this matter, it is even possible that some other Capitulatory Power (such as, in particular, Italy, whose policy in the Near East has lately been unduly active) would threaten to intervene for the protection of its own nationals.&quot;The change in the international situation has raised this question in an acute form. Italy&apos;s ambition to secure predominance in the Eastern Mediterranean will make her always ready to interfere in Egypt if possible. The Italian popula-tion in Egypt numbers over 70,000 and in Alexandria in particular 1,000 black-shirts are organized. If the Egyptians cannot secure the safety of these Italian subjects, Italy will step in and do this for herself.Military and Air Implications.32.   The safety of foreign interest in Egypt implies primarily, however, the internal security of Cairo and Alexandria.   In particular, Cairo is the heart [12679] c
of Egypt. All subversive activities, whether designed to sabotage the Suez Canal, to threaten the lives and property of foreigners, or to challenge by violence the authority of the Egyptian Government, are hatched there. If law and order is maintained in these cities there is little likelihood of such disorder breaking out elsewhere as would seriously endanger the lives and property of foreigners. To ensure adequate internal security in Cairo and Alexandria, it is essential that the British troops should remain. Their presence has had, and will continue to have, a settling effect and if serious disorder breaks out, they can deal with it at its source. The logical corollary to this is that there must be in these cities an efficient and reliable intelligence organization. This can only be based on British personnel in the Egyptian service, and in particular on the British element in the police. Without the intelligence provided by this element the British garrisons would be unable to anticipate or to prepare suitable plans to meet an emergency and might be committed to action based on unreliable information. The non-military provisions of the 1930 Treaty which sanctioned the elimination of the British element from the Egyptian police, should not, in the opinion of the Chiefs of Staff, be accepted in a future treaty.-33. In the event of military units being retained in the vicinity of Cairo and Alexandria, landing grounds and facilities must also be available in these localities in order to permit co-operation between British land and air forces.34. A further point in connection with the protection of foreign interests is that the European Powers might regard the abolition of the Capitulations more favourably if they could rely ultimately on British forces to protect the lives and property of their nationals in Egypt.Naval Implications.35. The sending of H.M. Ships to Alexandria or other Egyptian Ports in times of internal unrest and danger to foreigners in Egypt has frequently proved a valuable step in preserving order. It is most important that our right to act in this manner should be preserved, among other reasons, because there is always a danger of foreign nations sending their ships to the scene of trouble if ours do not arrive at once. This is an additional reason for assuring by Treaty our right to make use of Egyptian Ports. With such a right any disinclination on the part of the local authorities to call for Naval assistance should be lessened.Situation in present crisis if 1930 Treaty had been in operation.36. It is of interest to consider what would have happened in Egypt in the present international emergency if His Majesty&apos;s Government had been bound by the 1930 Treaty. Appendix B deals with this in detail, and from a perusal of this Appendix it is clear that we should have suffered under many grave disabilities.Need for defining our right to reinforce Egypt prior to outbreak of War.37. It has been stated, in CP. 6 (36), that one of the modifications in the 1933 draft Treaty provides for &quot; Abolition in the event of war, threat of war or serious disturbances within the Empire or in adjacent territories, of the restriction on the numbers of the British land and air forces to be maintained in Egypt.&quot;From the wording of Article 7 of that Draft, however, it appears that.the aid of Great Britain is to be given to Egypt only &apos;&apos; when either of the High Contracting Parties becomes engaged in war,&quot; in which case, only, the restric-tions on the numbers contained in the Annex to the Treaty will presumably be removed. That part of Article 7 which mentions the &apos;&apos; imminent menace of war or of serious disturbance within the territories under the sovereignty or authority of His Britannic Majesty or territories adjacent thereto, or in the event of a threat to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s essential communications,&quot; refers only to the &quot;facilities and assistance &quot;to be afforded by the Egyptian Government, and not
to His Majesty&apos;s Governments right to send additional forces, prior to an actua! outbreak of war.38. It is essential that it should be made clear beyond all possibility of doubt, m any future treaty, that His Majesty&apos;s Government do in fact possess the right to reinforce Egypt with naval, military and air forces in an apprehended emergency, and not only on the outbreak of war.Conclusions.39. Essential&apos;points in the discussion of military clauses of an Anglo-Egyptian treaty are : (1) General.(a) It must be made clear beyond all possibility of doubt in any future treaty that His Majesty&apos;s Government do in fact possess the right to reinforce Egypt with naval, military and air forces, and to take any steps necessary to protect vital strategic interests, in an apprehended emergency and not only on the outbreak of war; (6) The role of the British forces in Egypt is immutable and cannot logically be subject to any time limit or be a matter for submission to the League of Nations as was envisaged in the 1930. Draft Treaty;(c) That the non-military clauses should not be separated from the military clauses since these are interdependent; for example, a British element in the police and in the Egyptian Government is a corollary to British forces remaining in the cities of Egypt;(d) That His Majesty&apos;s Government must remain exclusively responsible for the security of the Suez Canal; no right to participate in this respon-sibility should be conceded to the Egyptian Government.(e) That it must be recognised that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot-evade the responsibility in the last resort for the protection of foreign interests, and that no Treaty can absolve them from this responsibility.(/) If it is considered inevitable, for political reasons, that there should be some limitation on peace-time strengths, the limitation will have to be a high one, in order to guard against the possibility of finding ourselves in an unfavourable military situation owing to some sudden and unforeseen development in either internal or external affairs. Furthermore, the treaty should contain some provision for increasing the strength of the peace-time garrison at some future date, if the trend of events indicates that such an increase is necessary.(g) That the immunities and privileges in jurisdictional and fiscal matters to be enjoyed by the British forces in Egypt be safeguarded;(h) That the armament and equipment of the Egyptian forces are not to differ in type from those of the British forces. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to use their good offices to facilitate the supply of such arma-ment and equipment, and in return the Egyptian Government to accept an increased number of British personnel with the Egyptian Forces.(i) No foreign instructors other than British shall be employed in the Egyptian forces, and the Egyptian Government shall not send personnel of their armed forces to be trained abroad elsewhere than in the United Kingdom.(2) Military.(a) That the right to keep British troops in the present locations in Cairoshould be retained.(b) That the right to place troops in or to the west of Alexandria should beagreed to,(c) That the number of troops to be stationed in Egypt in normal times tobe a matter for discussion between the two countries when the existing international situation has become stable. [12679] c2
A ir.(a) Limitation of Strength.-It may be practicable, from the point of viewof air defence, to agree to a peace-time figure of 400 pilots and the necessary ancillary personnel: (This was the limitation figure mentioned in the 1933 draft.) While international relations remain disturbed as they are to-day, it appears inevitable that the British air forces in Egypt should be maintained at a greater strength than was formerly the case. Although it is thought that the necessary increases, so far as they can be foreseen, can be effected without exceeding the limitation figure in the 1933 draft, that is not to say, however, that the principle of permanent limitation is acceptable.(b) Location of Permanent Air Bases. The actual peace-time location ofthe British air units permanently stationed in Egypt must depend to some extent on the agreed location of our land forces. Nevertheless, the speed and range of modern aircraft and the comparatively limited size of modern Egypt are such that the question of the exact situation of the air bases to be occupied in times of peace is not of primary importance provided that the considerations, mentioned below are fulfilled.(c) Freedom of Flight. It is vital that our air forces should have freedomof flight, both for training and operational purposes, over the whole of Egyptian territory, and that landing grounds and maintenance facilities should be available for their use wherever and whenever required. This requirement involves the right to visit and inspect aerodromes and landing grounds as often as may be considered necessary -to ensure that they are maintained in a satisfactory condition for use in an emergency. A very brief review of our defensive commitments will show that there are few populated areas in Egypt, and few desert regions, where adequate facilities for air operations might not be required at short notice.To meet (i) An Italian threat from Libya, we should require air facilities in North-West and Western Egypt, particularly in the coastal region (vide paragraphs 16 and 18 above).(ii) A threat to our Mediterranean sea communications or across the Eastern Mediterranean, we should require similar facilities along the whole of the Northern coast of Egypt and the Sinai Peninsula.(iii) A threat to our Red Sea communications, we should require air facilities in South-Eastern Egypt, flanking the Gulf of Suez and the Red Sea. The use of adequate aerodromes, landing grounds and seaplane anchorages in this area would also be essential as an alternative air route to India and the Far East, via Aden, should conditions in Iraq at any time prevent the safe operation of the Baghdad route.To secure (iy) Our Imperial air routes we need adequate facilities for the operation of both civil and military aircraft in the vicinity of Cairo; throughout the whole length of the Nile Valley; from the Western frontier via Alexandria and Cairo to the Canal Zone, en route to Gaza, Akaba or Port Sudan. The use of the Nile route is also necessary to assist in securing our rail, river and air communications with the Sudan, in the event of Italian aggression from Eritrea or Libya, (v) The Suez Canal, we need full facilities in the vicinity of the Canal Zone and the Sinai Peninsula.It is thus apparent that, without complete freedom of movement for our air forces, and without the right to ensure that all facilities for their operation are available and protected wherever they may be required.in an emergency, we shall not be in a position to secure our own interests, or to undertake the defence of Egypt itself against external aggression.
(4) A additional Considerations.It is suggested that in an Annex to the Treaty the following should be dealt with : (a) Censorship;(b) An agreement to continue to co-operate to prevent any mutual inter-ference between Egyptian W/T Stations and those of the British Forces in Egypt;(c) The establishment of Martial Law in the Canal Zone when necessary;(d) Restrictions on foreign aircraft crossing the Canal Zone and theinstitution of a corridor.
Copy of Telegram to Sir M. Lampson (Cairo) from the Foreign Office, ; No. 438, dated November 7, 1935.  .(Immediate.)FOLLOWING from Sir R. Vansittart :-&quot; According to Reuter&apos;s, Egyptian Government have issued an official communique&quot; about British assurances to Egypt. Reuter&apos;s text (which you can get from their representative) appears as received here to be harmless and to be based on a private conversation which I had with Egyptian Minister on the 6th November. Press here are being told that no official communication on these lines has been made to Egyptian Government, but that attitude of British Government is correctly described.&quot;I am expressing to Egyptian Minister my surprise that a private conversation should have been so misused. He emphasised, indeed, that he was only asking privately for guidance with a view to guiding King Fouad and discounting unfounded rumours.&quot;APPENDIX B.Situation in present Crisis if 1930 Draft Treaty had been in Operation.THE situation in the present crisis, if His Majesty&apos;s Government had been bound by the 1930 treaty, would have been that Egypt would be a sovereign independent State and a Member of the League of Nations; the Egyptian Government would &apos; be exclusively responsible for the lives and property of foreigners in Egypt; the British forces, limited to a total of 8,000 soldiers and 3,000 air forces, would be confined to certain specified areas in the Suez Canal zone, where they would co-operate with the Egyptian forces in the defence of the Canal, but where they would have been quite unable to operate efficiently against attack by land or air from Libya.2. In the first place, from Article 8 of the 1930 draft treaty (page 36, Cmd. 3575) it would appear open to doubt whether reinforcements could have been sent to Egypt until war had actually broken out. Article 8 enjoins on the Egyptian Government the &quot; provision of facilities &quot; in case of an imminent menace of war, but it is by no means clear whether this would include permission to move reinforcements. In anjr case, preliminary negotiations with the Egyptian Government would have been necessary which might have entailed considerable delay; preservation of secrecy would have been impossible, and unquestionably the Italians would have had early information of all our plans. At the best, therefore, the success of our defensive arrangements during the present emergency would have been jeopardized by such a delay, since it has taken several months even under present conditions to provide the necessary facilities on the northern coast. At the worst, our strategic freedom to reinforce our most vital Imperial artery in emergency might have been denied to us.3. By Article 7 of the Anglo-Egyptian Draft Treaty of 1930 Egypt would assist us in the capacity of an ally and give us the use of her ports, aerodromes and means of communication, but this would only be in the event of war or the imminent menace of war. If, therefore, this Treaty had been in force at the beginning of the present emergency we should have been able to send our fleet to Alexandria, erect defences and land Base Defence Personnel, only if Egypt agreed that the situation was one of imminent menace of war, or, failing Egyptian agreement, the matter had been taken to arbitration or to the League of Nations and decided in our favour. Moreover, even if Egypt had agreed to give us the use of her ports, aerodromes and communications, it would have been equivalent to making a declaration to the world that the situation was one of &quot; imminent menace of war.&quot; It is clear that such a course would not have been politically possible at the commencement of the present emergency.
i    273o4. Again, &quot; furnishing facilities and assistance in his power, including the use of his ports, aerodromes and means of communications&quot; could hardly be interpreted as including permission to instal guns and under-water defences for the protection of our ships using his ports. Consequently, under the 1930 Draft Treaty it is doubtful whether we could have installed the defences at Alexandria as we have done in the present instance. Further, with only Egyptian troops in Alexandria, the situation of Base Defence Personnel, &amp;o, even if we had been allowed to land them, Would have been very difficult.- 5. If, therefore, the 1930 Draft Treaty had been in force in the summer of 1935, it is very doubtful if we could have taken the naval measures (including Base Defence measures) we have taken in regard to Egypt.6 So far as the defence of the Suez Canal is concerned, it would appear that under Article 9 Egyptian troops might well have been responsible for the protection of a portion of the Canal. It is inconceivable that at a period of such grave international emergency and in view of the urgent need for complete secrecy in discussions with the Canal authorities, it would have been possible to allow Egyptian troops to take part in these defence measures.7. As regards the declaration, of Martial Law in this area, should this have proved necessary, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (in C.I.D. Paper No. 1141-B) stated that such a step would be difficult, if not impossible, under any Anglo-Egyptian Treaty which may be concluded.8. The note attached to the 1930 Treaty provided for the immediate abolition of the European Bureau of the Public Security Department, and for the retention, for five years only, of a Gertain European element in the police. This would unquestionably have resulted in a deterioration of the police intelligence services, and consequently it is very questionable whether early information of plots against the Canal would have reached the British Military Authorities. The lack of direct supervision over potentially hostile elements would have meant that more British troops would have had to be actively employed on the Canal defences than is actually the case at the present moment.9. With regard to the defence of the Western frontier, it would have been militarily unsound to have concentrated strong British forces in the Western desert with their communications and base organisation at Alexandria protected by Egyptian forces. It seems certain that British troops would have had to be sent to Alexandria to ensure the security of the rear communications of the forward troops. Further, Cairo became the main base of all forces in Egypt, and as it is also the only position from which the General Officer Commanding can control all activities and remain in close liaison with the Egyptian military and civil authorities, it would have been necessary to move headquarters to Cairo and to reoccupy with British troops. Considerations of amour propre would inevitably have influenced the Egyptian Government dangerously to delay permission for reoccupation.10. As regards internal security, although under Article 8 the Egyptian Government would have been responsible for the protection of foreign interests, undoubtedly foreign nations would have regarded the British troops as morally responsible for the safety of their nationals in the event of widespread disorder. With their nationals organised in Fascist units, it is reasonable to suppose that the Italians would have been in a position to foment internal disorder if faced only with Egyptian police and troops. It is even possible that the Italians would have intervened with the Fascist units, on the score of providing protection for their nationals and claiming that the Egyptian Government had failed in this respect. This would have produced a most awkward situation at a time of seriously-strained relations between Italy and ourselves. Moreover, it is doubtful whether, in view of the deterioration in intelligence work discussed above, the police would have had accurate information as to the extent of subversive activities and the distribution of Italian bribes. It is, in fact, probable that police and other Egyptian officials would not have been above^e accepting Italian payment for action, or inaction, in those circumstances.
