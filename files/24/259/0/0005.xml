THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   Jamiary 1936.SECRET.CP. 5 [36).CABINET.DISPUTE BETWEEN ITALY AND ABYSSINIA.Note by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Committee of Eighteen, which is a sub-committee of the so-called Co-ordination Committee set up to organise economic measures against Italy under Article 16 of the Covenant, will almost certainly have to meet during the next session of the League Council, which opens on the 20th January. It will have on its agenda the question of the extension of measures of embargo to certain additional articles, such as (1) petroleum and its derivatives, by-products and residues; (2) pig-iron, iron and steel; (3) coal, coke and agglomerates and the fuels derived therefrom.The Committee of Eighteen decided on the 6th November, 1935, that it was expedient that measures of embargo should be extended to these articles &quot; as soon as the conditions necessary to render this extension effective have been realised.&quot; It also decided that if the replies received by the Committee to the proposed extension and the information at its disposal warranted it, it would propose to Governments a date for bringing the new measures into force.The Committee of Eighteen has refrained from taking any further step in this matter in view of the efforts undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government to find a peaceful solution. As soon as it has been established by the appropriate body at Geneva (i.e., the Committee of Thirteen) that these efforts have borne no fruit, the Committee of Eighteen will almost certainly decide that it must now give further consideration to the sanctions question. It will be in a better position to do so than before because the Govern-ments chiefly interested have had time for reflection, and because, since President Roosevelt&apos;s speech on the 3rd January and since the publication of the proposed neutrality legislation, there is some indication of the probable attitude of the United States Government and of the action which that Government may be in a position to take.The most useful step for the Committee of Eighteen to take, in the first instance, would be to set on foot a technical enquiry into the probable effectiveness of the prohibition by League Members of the supply to Italy of the additional products in question. It is already fairly clear that an embargo on iron and steel and on coal would have little chance of success, as Italy can supply herself with iron and steel from Austria, and can probably meet her essential require-ments of coal from Germany; but in the case of oil there is room for investigation.I would suggest that the line to be taken by the United Kingdom repre-sentative on the Committee of Eighteen should be as follows : He should not oppose the opening of a discussion upon the question of an embargo on oil. He should not oppose, but should support, though, if possible, not himself proposing, that the Committee should initiate by the most appropriate means an expert enquiry into the probable effectiveness of the prohibition by Members of the League of the supply of petroleum and its derivatives, by-products and residues to Italy, in the light of such information as may be available of the intentions of non-Member States. The proposed enquiry might also cover the question of the prohibition by Members of the League of the use of their oil-tankers for the [12560]Copy No. 4
transport of oil to Italy and the question of oil bunkers. The findings of the enquiry would be submitted to the Committee of Eighteen for consideration.Should the United Kingdom representative find it desirable to make any observations of a more general nature upon the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s government -ment to an oil sanction, he might indicate that in reaching a final decision on this matter His Majesty&apos;s Government would be guided by (1) the extent to which an oil sanction could be made effective, and (2) the extent to which the collabora-tion of the armed forces of other Members of the League could be counted on in the event of a resort to arms by Italy against a Member of the League participating in the application of economic sanctions.A. E.January 9, 1936.
