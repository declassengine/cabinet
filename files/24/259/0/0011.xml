Copy No.    fcj,C A B I N E T.CP.11 (56)..PROPOSED ENQUIRY INTO WOMCING-CLASS EXPEMDITUHE, 2IPJIE SJ0K 0]F THE BASIS&apos; OF&quot; THE&quot;&apos;&apos;0FPIG&quot;IAL &quot;COST- &apos;of-livtug- Index -itombee. &apos;i/emorakdum by the minister of labour.It     Public attention is again &quot;being direoted to the Ministry of Labour cost-of-living index-number, and there are indications that when Parliament re-assembles renewed demands will be made for a revision of the basis on which the figures are calculated.2.     This index number was first published in 1915, with the objeot of measuring the monthly variations in the cost of maintaining unchanged the pre-war standard of living of working-class families.     That standard was determined mainly from information provided by a collection of budgets of household expenditure obtained as long ago as 1904, supplemented by certain estimates made in 1914-15, and has frequently been criticised as no longer -providing a satisfactory basis for measurements of current changes in costs of living.3*      On statistical grounds, the retention of a standard of expenditure established twenty to thirty years ago in the compilation of figures purporting to measure present-day changes in costs of living can no longer be defended, and previous Ministers of Labour have admitted, in the House of Commons, that as soon as conditions became sufficiently normal, an enquiry into working-class expenditure would be essential, in order to provide the data required for a revision of the basis of the index number. A Committee which was appointed by the Economic Advisory Council to consider the whole question unanimously recommended, in January, 1951,  -that a new collection of family budgets should be obtained forthwith and utilised to provide a revised &quot;basis for the index number.     This recommendation was accepted by the Trades Union Congress General Council, but was opposed by the National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations on the ground that conditions were then unsuitable for the proposed enquiry, and it was decided that no action should be taken at that timej4;     V/ith the improvement in employment, and the stability of price levels, during the past three years, the objections raised in 1931 have lost much of
their force.   Meanwhile, the lapse of a further period of five years has strengthened the case for revision of the index number, and if action is much longer delayed there is a serious danger that public confidence in the figures will be undermined.   As the movements of the index number directly regulate the wages of about a million workpeople in a number of industries in which sliding-scale arrangements are in operation, and are also taken into consideration in most other industries when wage settlements are being negotiated, it is important that the figures should &quot;be generally accepted as substantially accurate, 5,     Apart from the question of revision of the cost-of-living index^ information as to working-class family expenditure is now urgently required for various purposes.     The Advisory Committee on Diet and Nutrition,  axDpointed in July last by the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland to enquire into the facts in relation to the diet of the people, and to report as to any changes which appear desirable, have found that the available data on this subject are insufficient for their purposes and have forwarded to the Minister of Health a resolution urging that early steps should be taken to collect family budgets and to undertake dietary surveys.    I have been informed by the Minister of Health that he is in agreement with the Committee as to the importance   of collecting such information.     Moreover, enquiries on this subject would be of value in providing data as to actual and potential consumption, and the elasticity of demand for particular goods,and I -understand that the Agricultural Marketing Board?have a special interest in the collection of information of this nature.    The League of Nations also are investigating the subject of nutrition in relation to public health and the consumption of agricultural products, as a result of a resolution adopted by the Assembly of the League, in September   last, with the support of the British and Dominion delegates.6.     I-n some of the industries in which wage rates are directly regulated in accordance with the movements of the cost-of-living index figures, an announcement that a revision of the basis of that index is proposed may arouse apprehension of the possible effects of disturbing existing
arrangements;   but legitimate objections on this ground can probably be overcome if arrangements are made providing for continuity between the figures on the existing basis and those on the new basis.       It should also be observed that the results of an official enquiry into working-class family expenditure may be used, in some quarters, to direct attention to the relatively low expenditure on food, or other necessaries, among families with small incomes.     The results of various enquiries made by private investigators, however, applying to different periods and usually only to particular localities or selected sections of the working-classes, are already being utilised for purposes of propaganda, and in view of the widespread attention which is now being directed to questions of diet and nutrition in relation both to public health and to the consumption of agricultural products, it seems desirable that the facts should be ascertained.7*     In these circumstances, I regard it as essential that a working-class family budget enquiry should now be undertaken and that on the completion of this enquiry the basis of the official cost-of-living index figure should be revised.     Prior consultation with the Trades Union Congress General Council and the National Confederation of Employers1 Organisations will be desirable, and it will probably be necessary to appoint an Advisory Committee to co-operate with my Department in planning the details of the enquiry.     I now ask my colleagues to agree that I should proceed with the necessary arrangements, and institute the enquiry as early as possible, subject to re-consideration of the question if the discussions with the Trade Union Congress General Council and the Employers&apos; Confederation should disclose reasons of substance in favour of further postponement.8.      I may add that in reply to a question on this subject in the House of Commons on 19th December, I said that the matter was under consideration, but that I was not in a position to make a definite state-ment.     The matter will no doubt be raised again when Parliament re-asseirhles. 9.     Some notes are appended dealing in greater detail with certain aspects of this question.     It will be seen that the cost of the proposed enquiry is estimated at about  20,000 to  25,000.(intd. )     E. B.17th January, 1956....   -. ^
(1)    The Origin and Basis of the Official Cost of Living Index.The cost of living index number, which is published monthly in the &quot;Ministry of Labour Gazette&quot; originated in the need which was felt immediately after the outbreak of the War for some systematic measurement of the rise in the cost of foodstuffs.      To meet this need the Board of Trade began to collect at frequent intervals the current prices at which foodstuffs were being sold in working-class shops.      To combine in one &quot;foodstuffs&quot; index the increase recorded for the various articles it was necessary to give each article a &quot;weight&quot; appropriate to its importance.      The only comprehensive material available for assigning these &quot;weights&quot; was a collection of about 2,000 urban working-class family budgets made by the Board of Trade in 1904.     An average budget derived from these collected budgets had already been constructed and used for statistical purposes;    and the relative expenditures on the various articles of food as shown &quot;by this avex^age 1904 budget - with the addition of an allowance for margarine, which had increased in importance between 1904 and 1914 - were used as the &quot;weighting&quot; basis for the new Retail Pood Prices Index-Number.     When the Board of Trade was required early in 1915 to enlarge the scope of the Index-Number so as to cover not only food but the other principal items of working-class expenditure, a weighting basis for these    other items had to be devised.      As regards rents, there were available the results of an inquiry made in 1912-     For other items,  such as fuel and light, clothing, etc., estimates were made on various bases.      The five main groups of items, viz., food, rent, clothing, fuel and light, and miscellaneous, were combined in what were considered to be appropriate ratios.The basis so established has remained unaltered since the index number was first published, in 1915.     For the purpose which the index was then designed to serve, viz., to measure the average increase in the cost of maintaining unchanged the pre-war standard of living of working-class families, it was appropriate.      In view, however, of the considerable changes in consumption standards and in modes of living which have taken
a 7place during the past 20 years, it is not a suitable basis for an index number purporting to measure the monthly changes in present-day cost of living.(2) The Demands for a Revision of the Basis of the Index Number.On a number of occasions during the past thirteen years successive Ministers of Labour have admitted, in reply to Questions in the House of Commons, that a revision of the basis of the index number was desirable. They have pointed out, however, that an essential preliminary would be a new collection of budgets of v/orking-class family expenditure, and that this would involve extensive enquiries which could not usefully be undertaken during periods of rapidly changing price levels, or of trade depression and widespread unemployment and short-time working.This argument was generally accepted, both by the employers organisations and by the trade unions, until March 1930, when the Trades Union Congress General Council informed the Minister of Labour that, in their view, revision of the basis of the index number ought to be undertaken forthwith, and urged that an enquiry should be made in order to obtain the necessary data.     In view of these representations, it was arranged that the Economic Advisory Council should appoint a Committee to examine the whole question.     The Committee reported in January 1931, and unanimously recommended that a new collection of working-class family budgets should be obtained and utilised to establish a revised basis for the index number. The Trades Union Congress General Council approved these recommendations, but the National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations urged that conditions at that time were unsuitable for the proposed enquiry into family budgets and that there were no practical industrial considerations of such urgency as to require a costly enquiry of that nature to be undertaken at a time of pronounced instability.     After reference to the Cabinet, the Minister of Labour (Miss Bondfield) informed the Trades Union Congress General Council, in,April 1931, that the Government was not satisfied that the time was then opportune for collecting family budget information, owing to the abnormal conditions prevailing, or that any advantages to be gained at that time by revising the index number would
not be more than counterbalanced by the unrest and uncertainty that would probably be caused while the revision was being carried out; and that, in these circumstances, it was thought inexpedient to take any action for the present. In reply the Trs.des Union Congress General Council wrote to the Minister regretting the decision of the Government, and stating that, while they fully recognised the weight of the reasons advanced for&apos; not taking action at the present time, &quot;the criticisms which have been levelled at the cost-of-living index number in its present form clearly demonstrate that the figure does not command the confidence of the Trade Union  movement&quot;.The marked improvement in employment during the past three years, and the stability of retail prices during this period, have how largely invalidated the objections to an enquiry which applied with special force in the exceptional conditions of 1951.        Meanwhile, the lapse of a further five years, and the consequent further obsolescence of standards of consumption determined by reference to data collected twenty to thirty years ago, have    strengthened the case for an early revision of the basis of the index number, and pressure for early action is increasing.        It is particularly worthy of note that expert statistical opinion, which some years ago did not appear greatly concerned with this question, is now showing itself to be seriously impressed with the defects of the existing basis of the figures, and is talcing an active part in the movement for revision;   and it seems likely that if action is much longer delayed xoublic confidence in the index number will be destroyed. The matter is raised, from time to time, in the House of Commons, and as recently as 19th December, 1935, Mr. W. Astor, M.P., asked the Minister of Labour whether it was his intention to cause a fresh enquiry to be made into the subject of family budgets, in order that the information obtained through the investigation made in 1904 may be brought up to date In reply, the minister stated that the matter was under consideration, but that he was not at present in a position to make a definite statement,(3) The Meed for a Family Budget Enquiry for Other Purposes.Apart from the question of the collection of data for a revision of
the &quot;basis of the cost of living index, the pressure for a new enquiry into working-class family expenditure has recently been reinforced bydemands for such information for other purposes.      In July 1955, a Committeewas appointed by the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State forScotland &quot;to enquire into the facts,  quantitative and qualitative, inrelation to the diet of the people, and to report as to any changes which appear desirable in the light of modern advances in the knowledge of nutrition&quot;.     This Committee, the Chairman of which is Lord Luke, includes a highly representative selection of the most expert and authoritativescientific opinion on the subject of diet and nutrition.     After devotingsome months to an examination of existing sources of informa/tion, theCommittee have recently reached the conclusion that the available dataare inadequate to enable them satisft\ctorily to discharge their terms ofreference, and they have unanimously adopted the following resolution:&quot;Having regard to the small amount of information at present available as to the actual consumption of food by different sections of the population, and in view of the importance of the issues involved, the Committee regard it as essential that early steps should be taken to collect family budgets and to undertake dietary surveys on an extensive scale, and that the appropriate Departments should co-operate in devising the machinery and technique for the purpose&quot;.This resolution has been forwarded by the Minister of Health to theMinister of Labour, with an intimation that he agrees as to the importanceof collecting information as proposed by the Committee.Information regarding food consumption at different income levels,based on a comprehensive collection of family budget material, would bealso of great value in providing data as to actual and potential consumption and the elasticity of demand, for particular foods.     The need for more detailed information on this subject has recently been emphasised bydiscussions, initiated by Mr. S.M. Bruce, in the Assembly of the League ofNations, on the subject of nutrition in relation to public health and tothe consumption of agricultural products.     Following these discussions,the Council of the League has appointed a strong Commission, consisting ofeconomists, nutritional experts and agriculturists, to investigate this problem,, and the International Labour Office are collaborating in the
enquiry by bringing together the results of family budget enquiries in . various countries.      One of the most effective means whereby Great Britain can support this action by the League of Nations is by carrying out an official family budget investigation.It may be added that Agricultural Marketing Boards in this country are interested in obtaining further data as to the actual and potential market for their products, particularly milk, potatoes and bacon.     Some investigations into food consumption from this angle have already been carried out by the Market Supply Committee.     In the absence of any official collection of family budgets this Committee have been compelled to make use of a number of miscellaneous unofficial enquiries carried out at different times and by different methods in recent years, and it was the paucity of this material that led the Advisory Committee on Nutrition to urge the need for a comprehensive family budget enquiry.(^)    The Scope and Cost of the Proposed. Enquiry.If it is decided to undertake an enquiry it will be necessary, In order to obtain information of a character sufficiently representative for the purposes outlined above, to collect budgets from about 10,000 families, analysing their expenditure In a particular week or fortnight, and to obtain further budgets from the same families, or as many of them as can be induced to supply information, for three other weeks at different seasons of the year.      In order to obtain the collaboration of the trade -unions and other organisations whose assistance would be required in collecting the budgets, and to ensure public confidence in the results of the enquiry, it would be desirable that an Advisory Committee (analogous to that which assists the Board of Trade in connection with the quinquennial Census of Production) should be appointed to co-operate with the Ministry of Labour in planning the details of the enquiry. The Committee should include, inter alia, representatives of various Government Departments concerned, e.g., the Ministries of Health and Agriculture (England and Scotland), the Unemployment   Assistance Board, the Trades Union Congress General Council, and the National Confederation of Employers1    Organisations, a leading statistician, and perhaps
representatives of the co-operative movement, of the retail traders, and one of the prominent organisations of working-class women, and an economist.The total cost of the enquiry cannot be estimated precisely until the details have been settled in consultation with the proposed Advisory Committee, but it is roughly estimated at about  20,000 to  25,000; this would include a small payment to each family supplying information, the amount suggested being 2s. for each completed weekly budget.   The question has been considered whether this estimate of the total cost might be reduced by restricting the scope of the enquiry within a smaller compass, but in view of the importance of the purposes for which the information will be used, and the necessity for ensuring that the data collected shall be generally accepted as representative, the proposals outlined above appear to represent the minimum programme which can safely be adopted if satisfactory results are to be obtained.(5)   Possible Objections to the Enquiry.It should not be overlooked that the results of the enquiry, when published, may be used in some quarters for purposes of propaganda, by directing attention to the relatively low average expenditure per head on food which the figures may be expected to reveal among those sections of the working-class population in which incomes are relatively low, particularly where the numbers of children per family are high.    On the other hand, it should be observed that local enquiries which have been made, from time to time, by various individuals and organisations have already furnished some information which, though not adequately representative to provide a sound basis for generalisations, is sufficient for purposes of propaganda.    In the absence of trustworthy official statistics, the incomplete data derived from such partial enquiries are already being utilised to influence public opinion.    In view of the widespread interest which is now being directed to questions of food consumption, diet and nutrition, it seems desirable that more representative and trustworthy information should be collected.
Another consideration to be borne in mind is the possibility that the organisations of employers and workpeople may be apprehensive of the effects of a revision dt the basis of the cost-of-living index on existing wage agreements in those industries in which wages are directly regulated by the movements of the index figures.     Any legitimate objections on this ground, however, might be met by arranging that when the revised cost of living index is published, it shall be linked up with the present index so as to provide a continuous series.   Such an arrangement was suggested by the Committee appointed in 1930 by the Economic Advisory Council, as a means of overcoming the difficulties that might otherwise arise in connection with wages scales dependent on the cost-of-living index.
