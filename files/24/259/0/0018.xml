[Thia Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government.]Printed for the Cabinet,   February 1936.SECRET.CP. 18 (36). Copy No................CABINET.REVISE. -Highlands Question in Kenya.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.In paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Memorandum on affairs in Kenya circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. 7 (36)) a proposal is made for giving effect to certain of the recommendations of the Morris Carter Commission regarding the reservation of the Highlands area in Kenya for European settlement. I understand that it is intended that the proposed Order in Council should be confined to a geographical definition of the boundaries of the Highlands area, and that no mention will be made in it of the &quot; privileged position &quot; of Europeans, nor will it contain anything giving statutory effect to the existing administrative practice under which the area is reserved for European settlement.The Government of India have impressed on me very strongly the importance from the political point of view in India of ensuring that nothing should be done to worsen the existing situation as regards the reservation of the Highlands area, and they would have preferred that the issue of any Order in Council on the subject should be avoided. In the light of the discussions which I have had with the Secretary of State for the Colonies and his predecessors, I was prepared to accept the above proposal as a reasonable compromise which went as far as was possible towards meeting the views of the Government of India on the main issue.My attention has, however, recently been drawn to a further complication, which I feel bound to bring to the notice of my colleagues, namely, the bearing of the St. Germain Convention of 1919 on this matter. Article 3 of that Convention lays it down that &quot; the nationals of those Powers, or of States, Members of the League of Nations, which may adhere to the present Convention shall, subject only to the limitations necessary for the maintenance of pvrblic security and order, enjoy with-out distinction the same treatment and the same rights as the nationals of the Power exercising authority in the territory . . . with regard to the acquisition and trans-mission of their movable and real property.&quot; India adhered to the Convention as a Member of the League of Nations. To argue that the Convention cannot be considered to be binding as between signatories representing parts of the Empire may be sound in law, but it is no defence from the moral or political point of view, and I understand that the Secretary of State for the Colonies does not contest the view that a statutory perpetuation of the existing discrimination against non-Europeans in the Bighlands area would be a violation of the Convention, though he is of opinion that a statutory discrimination limited to Indians only would be legally defensible. Whatever the legal position may be, I cannot myself see how we could defend a statutory discrimination against Indians eo nomine. I find it equally difficult to defend the present position under which discrimination against Indians is maintained by administrative order. If a national of an Asiatic foreign State which has adhered to the Convention, e.g. Japan, were to demand the right to purchase land in the Highlands, his demand could not, I presume, be refused on the ground that the refusal was administrative not statutory. And if that is so, are we prepared to justify administrative practice under which Indians are placed in a worse position than nationals of an Asiatic State which is not a member of the British Empire ?It may be said that we need not anticipate the awkwardness of the situation that would arise if a Japanese made such an application. But here I am in a difficulty that arises from my responsibilities as Secretary of State for India. So far nothing has been said to the Viceroy about the bearing of the St. Germain Convention on the matter, which, as I have said, has recently come to my notice. The publication of the Order even in the modest terms proposed, will not pass without comment in India and will almost certainly form a subject of correspon-dence between the Viceroy and myself. And I cannot undertake permanently to conceal from him the bearing of the St. Germain Convention upon the matter, and he is his turn will, 1 have little doubt, be unwilling to keep his Government in the dark. It seems to me inevitable in these circumstances that they will raise the points set out in the latter part of this note and, as 1 have indicated, I do not at present see what answer is to be made to them.India Office, Z.30th January 1936. 4531      75   2.36
