MILITARY ASPECTS OF AN ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TEE. - TY.R E P 0 R Tolo      Arising out of consideration by the Cabinet of the Report of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Egypt (CP. 25 (36) paragraph 16) we have been asked to report on the following question:If it is found impossible to induce the Egyptian Delegation to accept  either of Sir Miles LampsonTs suggestions (a) or (b),  and it becomes necessary for the Cabinet to decide between some third course or getting no Treaty at all,is it preferable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should endeavour to secure the right, to station troops -(l)  In the east, on the Suez Canal;(2) In the west for the defence of the western frontier at, ar preferably near, Alexandria!(3) At Helouan, ten miles south of Cairo), where there is an aerodrome;Or, alternatively, to abandon the right to station troops at Helouan and endeavour to secure the right only to station troops as in (l) and (2) above ?We have also been instructed, that in answering the above questions we should take into consideration whether either of the above proposals would be more acceptable if the total British forces in Egypt were increased,2.      As stated in the report of the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence (CP. 25 (36) paragraph 16) we regard the maintenance of the existing barracks at Aocassia and Helmieh as the minimum consistent with the safety of our imperial responsibilities,;3,      To this opinion,  which is based on military considerations we still adherea If, however, the Government should feel
458themselves constrained for political reasons to accept the risks of evacuating Abbassia and Felmieh,  of the two alternatives put to us we should prefer the one which includes Helouan.    It will be essential, however, that the strength of the force should not be less than the present forces at Abbassia, Helmieh and the Cairo areas (less possibly one battalion to be moved to Alexandria^.4. &apos;   We must enter a caveat, however, that as yet we have not had an opportunity of making a thorough investigation into the conditions at, and the suitability of lielouan for use as a military station for British troops.        We attach great importance to the question of the health and welfare of the British troops in Egypt and to the need for ensuring that there exists at Helouan enough suitable ground to establish a cantonment with the necessary amenities.50      In the Report of the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence (paragraph 16) it was pointed out that on military grounds we disliked a station such as Helouan south of Cairo. The main reason for this is that any british force in Helouan would have to pass through Cairo which is a nodal point in the communication ions of the country,  on its way to re-inforce either the western frontier or the Suez Canals    In cases of serious disaffection in Cairo this would be very disadvantageous!.        A further disadvantage is the lack of contact at Helouan between Egypt and British Forces which would be a serious drawback from the point of view of securing a spirit of co-operation between them06e      Notwithstanding these disadvantages, as already indicated we should much prefer a garrison at Helouan to the.entire evacuation of the Cairo areas        Not only bee-ause of the neewestof a  central re-re-inforcement,  either north/or east, but alsoto ensure that in an emergency we can re-assert our control ever and return to Cairo,  if necessary,, in the shortest possible
459ENtime..      Moreover, in the event of there being no militaryin the vicinity of Cairo or garrison/at Heicuan it would be necessary for the Royal AirForce at present located there to be withdrawn elsewhere.. 7c      In all these circumstances, while we do not regardHelouan as a substitute for the existing stations in and nearCairo as satisfying the minimum conditions of safety for ourimperial communications in Egypt, we should greatly prefer amilitary station there to a complete withdrawal to theneighbourhood of Alexandria and the Canal Zone.80      There is one further point on which we desire toreport,  although it does not come within our terms of reference.We would draw attention, as within the provisions ofparagraph 39 (l) (a) of our original Report (Paper NOo0.0.8.430)9 to the importance to Egypt of her having not onlysupport from the British Army and Air Force but also from theBritish Fleet in the Mediterranean, when we are no longerresponsible for the protection of foreign interests.)        TheEgyptian Government might be in an unpleasant position if? inthe event of any trouble, she was threatened by foreign naval- - sendforces.       The British Fleet would not be able to /assistance if that request was not expected naval forcesunless asked, and/at the time might not be within reach.(Sd: )    ERNLE CHATFIELD.A.A.MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD.
