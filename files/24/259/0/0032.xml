THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1936.SECRET. Copy No.C.P. 32 (36)CABINET.EXPORT CREDITS FOR RUSSIAN ORDERS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN view of the memorandum submitted by the President of the Board of Trade, recommending extension of credits for trade with the Soviet Union, I have prepared the following brief note explaining the attitude of my Department towards this question.2. As is known to many of my colleagues, my predecessor had advocated a loan rather than increased export credits for dealing with the problem raised in the President^ memorandum; and I still consider that there would, be great advantages in an arrangement involving the raising of a loan on the London market, guaranteed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, the proceeds of which would be deposited in London and exclusively devoted to paying for Soviet orders placed in this country over a number of years, and on which the Soviet Government would pay a higher rate of interest than would be given to the subscribers, the balance being utilised by His Majesty&apos;s Government to settle, the claims by payment of annuities for a period of years calculated on a percentage value of approved claims, which the holders could sell if necessary and so convert their claims into cash. Further funds for this last purpose would be provided by the so-called &quot; Baring balances &quot; and other bank deposits, consisting of sums once belonging to the former Russian Government and now lying idle in British banks, to which the Soviet Government have a legal claim which they have hot enforced, and which they would be asked definitely to forgo if assured of the loan.3. The advantages of this proposal from the British point of view would be  (1) That it would remove almost the last major cause of friction between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Soviet Government, and enable them to proceed to the negotiation of a permanent commercial treaty;(2) That it would give political satisfaction to the Soviet Government and help to confirm them in their present policy of collaboration with His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government and with the League of Nations;(3) That it would give satisfaction to the claimants, a numerous class with a large and constant grievance, whose representatives in Parliament, such as Captain Cazalet and Sir W. Davison, have themselves been urging it on His Majesty&apos;s Government as a solution of their problem;(4) That it would enable orders to be given to those branches of British industry which are most in need of them, and to which it would afford employment over a long period of time; and(5) That it would give this country an initial advantage in the Russian market, which her competitors would find it almost impossible to^ overcome since, for a period of several years, the Soviet Government would be bound to place here the greater part of their new orders, 8346  .[12708]
: 4. On the other hand,, it was maintained,&apos; when this proposal was discussed between the Departments concerned, that the grant of extended credits through An- expansion of the present export credits procedure, would have the following advantages from a loan : (!) No legislation; -(2) A shorter risk and a smaller degree of risk;(3) Some provision against loss in the event of a Soviet default;(4) Greater elasticity; and(5) An earlier result.5. As regards the first of these it is, of course, always convenient to avoid legislation when possible; but it seems unlikely that there would be any serious difficulty in passing the necessary legislation in this case, since a loan would be welcome to the Opposition parties and to the representatives of the claimants&apos; interests, who, on the other hand, would protest strongly against the grant of increased credits without satisfaction for those interests. On the second and third points there are reasons for thinking that the risk in the case of a loan would be little different from that incurred by the grant of credits, while, if the proceeds of the loan were deposited in this country, as proposed, and only drawn out as and when orders were paid for, there would be as much provision against loss as could be secured under a credit scheme. As regards elasticity, this is a point which should tell in favour of the loan, rather than the reverse : the Soviet Govern ment would be bound to use the loan productively, since they would pay interest on the whole amount borrowed, while they could leave a credit unutilised, as, indeed, they left, until quite recently, the greater part of their last credit of 200 million reichsmarks in Germany; while, if a loan were granted to.them here, they would be prevented from playing off His Majesty&apos;s Government against foreign Governments in the matter of credits, as they have hitherto done with some success, and as they may be expected to do still&apos;more effectively now that such large offers are being made to them from France and Germany, but would be definitely tied to a long-term programme of orders. For the same reason, it seems unlikely that negotiations for credits, if these were on a comparable scale to the loan, would produce a result with any less delay and haggling.6. In view, however, of the opinion expressed by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlin, when he was in London last week, that the issue of a Soviet loan in this country at a time when the Franco-Soviet Pact is due for ratification by the French Chamber, might conceivably provide Herr Hitler with an excuse for some such act as the reoccupation of the demilitarized zone, and of the urgency of forestalling the present German attempt to monopolise the Russian market by the grant of the very large credit mentioned in the memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade, I am prepared for the present at least, to postpone discussion of the loan and to agree to the Presidents proposal. At the same time I feel that the Cabinet should take a decision on this question in full knowledge of two facts : (1) That the Soviet Government would give us a better bargain in return for a loan, since they prefer it for political reasons, having, indeed, no overwhelming commercial reason for: requiring either a loan or credits in view of the rapid development of their gold production, which makes it possible that they will need no foreign financial assistance at all in a few years&apos; time; and (2) that a loan provides the only means now open to His Majesty&apos;s Government to obtain any adequate satisfaction for the British creditors of Russia in fulfil-ment of their repeated pledges to them, the value of which, on the other hand, will dwindle to vanishing point with the grant of extended credits, even if the &quot;Baring balances&quot; are utilised for a small class of claims; while if those balances are not used, it will be plain that the pledges will never-be honoured.7. i understand the President to agree that in present circumstances it is not practicable to make an offer of credits to the Soviet Government conditional on their renunciation of their claims to the &quot; Baring balances.&quot; The Soviet Ambassador knows that such.a renunciation would be required in return for a loan, and has intimated that his Government would accept that condition; but it seems clear that an offer of extended credits, which are not essential to them and which they can certainly obtain from the German and probably from the French Government also, would not be sufficient to induce them to make a formal

The position is, therefore, that while it has been estimated that a loan of  20 million at 7 per cent, interest would provide enough, with the &quot; Baring balances,&quot; to pay some 10 per cent, on each claim when the nominal value of the claims had been revised by an impartial commission, the creditors will now remain completely unsatisfied and will realise, as will everyone else, that any attempt to support their claims has been finally abandoned, while His Majesty&apos;s Government will still remain bound by their pledge not to conclude a permanent commercial treaty, since they can hardly main-tain that they have secured the fulfilment of the condition which they themselves have laid down as the essential preliminary to this negotiation, viz., a settlement of British claims against the Soviet Government. When the Anglo-Soviet Commercial Agreement was concluded two years ago it met with the criticism that, though His Majesty&apos;s Government had declared that it was a temporary agreement pending a settlement of the question of debts and claims, it was, iri fact, obvious that its signature gave the Soviet Government all they wanted for the moment and deprived His Majesty&apos;s Government of their only effective weapon for enforcing payment of the sums owed to British subjects the threat of closing the British market to Soviet goods; and, indeed, although it was at no time likely that the weapon would be used for that purpose, whatever misgivings the Soviet Government may have had were put to rest when the agreement was signed. Since then the charge has frequently been made against His Majesty&apos;s Government, both in Parliament and the press and in letters to the Foreign Office, that they had left the claimants to their fate for the sake of securing general commercial advantages. In reply to this charge, His Majesty&apos;s Government have repeatedly and publicly decared that they have not lost sight of the claimants&apos; grievances; that they sympathise with the great hardships to which many of t-hem have undoubtedly been reduced; and that they will lose no opportunity of seeking a settlement of their claims. It will thus be very difficult to explain in Parliament the reasons why they have felt unable to honour these pledges.A. E.
