OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.STATE OF TRADE - DECEMBER,   1955.Summary- of reports submit ted &quot;by members of the Board of Trade Advisors&apos;&apos; Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources);OVERSEAS TRADE.    Imports in December at  74.5 m. were  11.S m. more than in December,  1934.      Over  three-quarters of the increase was due to an increase in food and raw materials.      Of the increase of  2.2 m.  in manufactured goods over  544,000 was in respect of non-ferrous metals and  357,000 of oils, fats and resins.Exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures at  34.92 m.  were  517,000 more than in December,  1934.Re-exports amounted to  5.4 m., an increase of  1.8 m, over December,  1934.ElffLOYMENT.      The total number of unemployed persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges at 16th December was 1,858,555,  a decrease of 49,997 as compared with 2 5 th No v emb e r.The main variations were; -London ...... ..... , - 13, 328South   &quot;Eastern ... - 238South   Western ... - 5,905midlands ......... - 1,413North Eastern .... - 11,759North \/estern  .... - 13,120Scotland ......... * 3,144The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-54 in employment at 15th December was 10,599,000.      This was 52,000 more than at 25th November and 340,000 more than at 17th December,  1934.
There was a further improvement in employment in coal mining, iron and steel manufacture, engineering and the cotton and linen industries.      Employment also increase in the distributive trades,   the construction and repair of vehicles,  tailoring, dressmaking and textile bleaching and dyeing.     On the other hand, employment continued to decline in building, pottery manufacture and the fishing industry and there was also some falling off in hosiery manufacture and in the boot and shoe industry.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.      For the four weeks ended the 29th December railway traffic receipts increased by  285,000 (2.53/3) compared with the corresponding period of 1934.      There were increases of 4.59$ in respect of merchandise, minerals and live stock and 5.79^, in respect of coal, coke and -patent fuel, but a decrease of 0.61^ in passenger traffic.     The total receipts for the fifty-two weeks ended 29th December amounted to  150.8 in.  as against  149.25 m. for the same period of 1934.3KIPPIKG AND SHIPBUILDING.      Shipping showed an all-round improvement in December when the Chamber of Shipping index number for freights  (1913 = 100) was 96.11 as against 89.74 in November and 80.77 in December, 1934.At the 1st Jaiuary 425,000 net tons of shipping were laid up at ports in Great Britain and Ireland as compared with 502,000 on 1st October last and 878,000 a year ago.There was some improvement in the shipbuilding position.      The amount of tonnage urd er construction in Great Britain and Ireland on  the 31st December was 743,000 gross tons as against 531,000 on 30th September and 597,000 a year ago.
BANKING. Money was easy until the middle of the month when it became increasingly usable.    Rates for loans hardened in sympathy and increased from -%% in the f irst half of the month for loans into early January to between 2% and 2-g% at the end of the month.    The Treasury bill rate rose from ll/9d.  at the end of November to 15/9d.  on the 20th December, but fell sharply to ll/4d.  on the 27th.The dollar varied between 4.92-g- and 4.93?.      The French franc   has shown fluctuations, the spot rate varying between 7415l/6 and 74&apos;7/1.6, while the three months&apos;  forward rates moved more widely between 2f francs and I^MlS francs discount.    The French bank rate was reduced from 6% to &amp;% at the end of the month.The price of gold fluctuated between 140/lld.  and 14l/3d.The silver market has been disturbed by the attitude of the American Treasury who announced on the 9th December that they would be willing to take only a part of the silver offering and that at a reduced price.      This policy has been continued and the price of spot silver fell from 29^d. on the 1st December to 20-gd.  on the 24th.    Later there was a recovery to 22-g-d.  on demand from India.COAL.    The average weekly output of coal during the thirteen weeks ended 28th December was 4,623,000 tons as compared with 4,474,000 tons in the corresponding quarter of 1934 - an increase of 3.3$.      The average number of wage-earners employed was 750,700 as compared with 767,700. a year before.Exports in December amounted to 2.9 m.  tons as compared with 3.1 m.  tons in December 1934.      A heavy fall in exports to Italy (400,000 tons) and smaller decreases in exports to Spain, France, Germany, Netherlands and Belgium were partly offset by increases to most other markets,  including the Irish Free State, Egypt, Denmark, Argentina and Norway.
Iron and Steel.  Conditions were rather quieter in December owing to the Christmas holidays.    Recently business lias been handicapped by uncertainty over the coal-mining position. Consumption of pig-iron is still in advance of output.    The semi-finished steel section continues to find difficulty in coping . with demand, while in the finished steel section many works are behind with deliveries and some departments are working at full capacity.    Demand for shipbuilding and structural steels promises to be well maintained for some time.    Overseas business has been quiet,  although the volume of business has been promising.Scotland.    Order books promise a good volume of work during 1936.    Demand for semi-finished steels has been strong and plate mills have been well occupied.    At the same time business in sheets has also improved, and structural engineers continue to be well occupied.North Bast Coast.  Conditions continued highly satisfactory in December and makers have sufficient orders to ensure work for many months to come.    Demand for pig-iron has been exceptionally strong owing to scarcity of scrap.  Producers of billets and sheet bars have been working to capacity,  The local shipyards   have received encouraging orders and producers of shipbuilding steel will be busy for some time.Sheffield.    Prospects continue highly favourable.    Demand for basic and acid billets has been heavy.    Manufacturers of aircraft and stainless steels continue very busy and railway material producers have been well occupied.South Wales.    Good orders have been placed and, inparticular, heavy finished steel has been in strong demand.The market for steel sheet and tinplate bars has been active and the domestic demand for tinplates fairly satisfactory,Welsh tinplate makers have sold so heavily in foreign markets for the first quarter that further sales have been stoppeduntil April or until other participants in the international agreement have filled their quotas.-4-
-   -    152ENGINEERING.    The position remained satisfactory in December.      The volume of new business has been maintained and prospects are encouraging.      Activity in marine engineering has been further stimulated in recent months by the increase in shipbuilding orders.Exports of machinery in December were valued at  3.-25 m. as against  3.20 m. a year ago. Taking the year as a whole, exports were  38.5 m.  as against  32,8 m.  in 1934.MOTOR INDUSTRY.    The number of motor vehicles newly registered in November was 28,666 or 3,888 more than in November, 1934;    there was an increase of 3,174 in private cars but a decrease of 286 in other vehicles.The production of private cars and taxis for October was 28,255 as against 21,591 in October,  1934,      The production of commercial vehicles declined from 8,545 to 7,986.During the year ended 31st December exports of private cars and chassis amounted to 54,517 and commercial vehicles and chassis to 13,685,  showing, when compared with 1934,  an increase and a decrease respectively of 24.2&apos;/6 and 0.4$.. Imports of complete private cars and taxis during December amounted to 636,  or 232 more than in December,  1934,LIGHT METAL, INDUSTRIES.    The strong all-round demand f^r non-ferrous manufactures has continued and prospects are encouraging.      During the quarter ended 31st December the foundry trade has shown probably the largest expansion in any quarter since 1931.      The cutlery,  silver and electro-plate trades are experiencing a seasonal quietness.      Presswork remains very busy and conditions are satisfactory In the tool trades, lock and allied trades, metal smallwares and needles. The position in the metallic bedstead trade has been well maintained and architectural metalwork has improved somewhat. There was a slight falling-off in the enamelled hollow-ware trade.
J. 5 3ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.    The past year has seen steady all-round improvement in the electrical industry which is expected to continue.On the heavy side,  several large contracts were placed in December.      In most classes of installation material and light apparatus production shows a considerable increase as compared with a year ago.Consumption of electricity during December amounted to 1,929 m* units,  an increase of 23*9% over December, 1934. The total consumption in 1935 showed an increase ef 13,6% over 1934,COTTON.    There was a recession from the high level of activity reached in November.     Average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to mills were 25.4 m. lbs. against 30.6 m.  lbs. in November and 24.3 ni*  lbs.  in December, 1934.      The decline was felt principally in the Egyptian section, but takings of all growths decreased.Raw cotton prices fell considerably.      Yarn prices also tended to fall,  though to a lesser extent, and spinners&apos; margins, both in American and Egyptian sections,  increased.Yarn exports at 11.9 m, lbs. were rather less than in November, but 1.5 m.  lbs. more than in December,  1934.    Exports of piece goods at 147.6 m.  sq*yds. were 10.9 m.   sq,yds.  less than in November and 12.9 m.  sq.yds.  less than in December, 1934.      The decrease, as compared with the previous month, was spread over most markets.      Exports to Australia, however, increased by 2.1 m.  sq.yds.SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.    The demand for rayon yarns from all sections of the trade was quiet in December. Exports of singles yarn in December amounted to 756,000 lbs. as compared with 1,005,000 lbs.  in December, 1934.      There was a considerable drop in exports to Australia.In the early part of the month business was quiet in rayon piece goods owing to the apprehension cf buyers that the 6d. per lb. Excise duty on rayon might be removed.      The
announcement then made, however,  that it was not intended to remove this duty, at any rate until March, 1937, increased confidence and substantial contracts were placed during the last two weeks.    Severe competition from&quot; Japanese rayon goods is expected shortly.The demand for real silk piece goods declined owing,  it is stated, to Japanese competition.      The price of raw silk has shown a tendency to fall in most markets.WOOL.    There was little change in the general activity of the industry during December.      Raw wool prices remained steady.    Exports of tops, yarns and tissues decreased slightly as compared&apos;with November.   During the twelve months ended 31st December exports of tops and tissues showed considerable increases over 1934, but yarns declined slightly.The general activity of the industry has improved considerably during the last four months and the position is now much better than it was a year ago.      The development of the export trade continues to be hampered by restrictions imposed in countries abroad.    Reports indicate that the volume of new orders and enquiries is well maintained but that customers show a disposition only to meet their immediate r e qu i r em en-ts.HIDES AND LEATHER.    Prides of hides generally rose throughout the month and trade was active.      Certain classes of hides, particularly heavy hides, were difficult to obtain.In many classes of leather tanners remained well sold ahead and were not anxious to accept further commitments.      Sole leather tanners were, in particular, well occupied.      Sales of upper and lining leathers, however,    fell away,      There was a noticeable increase in the demand for leather from abroad.CHEMICALS.    Sales of alkali In the home and export markets during December were satisfactory and deliveries of chlorine products and acids though showing a substantial decline were still maintained at good levels.      Sales of dyestuffs, both on home and foreign account, increased.      Owing to large orders from Ireland sales of sulphate of ammonia showed an increase over December last, but total sales for the fertilizer year 1935/36 showed a decline.      It is anticipated, however, that this deficit will gradually be made up.      Good business was &quot;transacted in coal tar products during the month, and the improvementin wood distillation products continues.      Business in pharmaceutical-7-
products has in general teen on a limited scale.POTTERY. All sections of the industry were fairlywell occupied in November.     There was some seasonal slackening in new orders for general earthenware and chinaware.      Glazed wall and hearth tiles and sanitary ware continued in good demand.PAPER.      Trade was well maintained in December and in some directions (e.g. miscellaneous printing papers) the demand was exceptionally good towards the end of the   month.RETAIL TRADE.     The money value of retail sales in November was 7.0$ greater than in November, 1934.   All areas shared in this improvement.    Sales of food and perishables continued to expand, the increase for November being 9.6$ as compared with a rise of 7*1$ for February-October.    Sales of other merchandise also expanded as a whole, the November rise being 4.5$ as compared with A.Oft for February-October.    The largest increases were in boots and shoes and sports and travel goods.    Piece goods sales again declined.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE.      The sales of the Co-operative Wholesale Society for the four weeks ended 7th December show an increase of 10.4$ as against a year ago.     The weighted average of the wholesale prices of seven of the principal commodities was 7*84$ higher and of the retail prices of the same commodities 3.32$ higher than a year earlier.CANADIAN TRADE.     Economic conditions again improved in November, the index of the physical volume of business being 110.0 as compared with 107*2 in October.    Exports of nickel reached a new high level and the silver output increased. Shipments of copper and gold, however,  declined.Newsprint production was higher than in any post-war month.    The output of motor cars and trucks increased considerably and imports of crude rubber (mainly for tyre manufacture)    rose from 1,800,000 lbs. in October to 5,800,000 lbs.
AUSTRALIAN TRADE.       2,197,712 bales of wool were received into store from the 1st July to the 30th November, as compared with 2,172,496 a year ago, while 1,120,560 bales were sold or shipped as against 827,291 in 1934.      Wheat and flour shipments for December were equivalent to 5.62 121. bushels of wheat against 6.59 m. bushels a year ago.     Butter exports from the 1st July to the 28th December amounted to 47,062 tons as compared with 52,470 tons a year ago.      Imports of merchandise during November amounted to  8.96 m.    (Australian currency) compared with  7.9 m. in November, 1934.SOUTH AFRICAN TRaDE.     The expansion of business activity in the Union is expected to continue steadily during 1936 althoug at a slower rate than heretofore.    Exports in October, excluding gold, amounted to  2.95 m. as against  2.50 m. in October, 1934, the increase being largely due to bigger shipments of wool. Imports were  6.70 m. as against  6.57 m. a year ago.   Activity in the gold mining industry continues at a high level and coal producing during the month increased by nearly 10% over last year.     The farming industry is still suffering from the effects of the drought.      Wool prices remain firm, while production of butter and cheese continues in excess of the country&apos;s consuming capacity and further consignments are to be exported.INDIAN TRADE.      Imports of merchandise in December were valued at 1060 lakhs of rupees as against 1035 in December, 1934, while exports amounted to   1372 as compared with 1223.    Standing crops are reported to be in fair condition save in some districts where crops have been affected ov/ing to lack of rain.The first estimate of the 1935-6 linseed acreage is 2,521,000 acres, or practically the same as a year ago.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.Argentina.     The uncertain political outlook tends to overshadow all other issues.     The Grain Regulating Board&apos;3 minimum basic prices for wheat and linseed were raised during the month, and local prices rose,    Prospects for the new maiae crop are satisfactory and local prices have been firm.   Arrivals
of wool are increasing in volume, but sales are less than usual,Exports in November were higher than in November 1954 and for the first eleven months of 1935 they were 7,4fo higher (in value) than in the corresponding period of 1934,, Imports for the first eleven months showed an increase of 6.8$.      Imports from the United &quot;Kingdom were slightly greater in volume than a year ago, but lower in proportion to the total.Brazil..      Coffee markets have been quiet and prices remained firm.      Shipments continue well ahead of last year.The exchange situation shows little alteration.      It is estimated that the Federal Government should be able to meet with ease its foreign debt service under the existing a r r an g em en t s..Imports and exports (in terms of Brazilian currency) for the first nine months of 1935 showed increases respectively of 5 3j4 and 18^, when compared with January/. September,  1934.Chile.      General conditions continue good.      Export business has been limited, but wool prices have risen steadily.      Conditions for sheep and cereals are excellent and the crops now being harvested are promising.      Copper production in January/October, 1955,  was higher than in January/October of any year since the beginning of the depression.      Although there are signs that the Government recognise the necessity for modifying the present system of control,  the exchange market is no easier,  owing to the Government again suspending their sales of United States dollars.      Local manufacturing industries continue active.Peru.      Cotton prices have remained firm.      Exports in the first nine months of 1955 were slightly less than in Jenuary/aepteiober, 1934, but imports were % greater.
Colombia.      Total coffee exports in 1935 are estimated to be greater than in .1934.      Total exports for  the first tec months of 1935 were about 2$ less, out imports some 28f&amp; greater than in January/October, 1934.Uruguay.      The yal tie of wool exports in the first six months of 1935 were some 87$, greater than January/June, 1934c      Imports from the United Kingdom in the first six months of 1935 show a fall of nearly 32$ as compared with January/June,  1934.
