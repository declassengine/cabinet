Commissioner for the Special Areas inScotland.Report for the period 1st July, 1935 to 31st December, 1935.To the Right Honourable Sir Godfrey Collins, K.B.E.; C.M.G., M.P., Secretary of State for Scotland.Sir,I have the honour to submit the following report on my operations under the Special Areas (Development and Improvement) Act 1934 for the period of six months from 1st July to 31st December 1935.PART I. Introduction.1. My first report, covering the period from the inauguration of my office to the 30th June, 1935, recorded the initial steps taken to set in motion a variety of schemes intended to facilitate the economic development and social improvement of the defined Special Areas and I am glad to record that, generally speaking, the schemes referred to, and others then in course of preparation, have progressed satisfactorily. In certain cases it will, of course, be impossible fully to assess the results for some time to come and this applies particularly in the case of industrial and agricultural developments. The present report, read in conjunction with the one previously presented, will I hope afford a satisfactory record of one year&apos;s intensive effort during which my own immediate organisation, started from small beginnings, has necessarily been enlarged so that it now includes, in addition to a central office staff, certain outdoor officers needed to carry on such of the schemes as, in the absence of other agencies, I have been obliged to take under my direct control.The report now made is in the nature of an interim progress report and I have again refrained from general conclusions, except in a very few instances where my immediate object is to direct the attention of interested parties to problems requiring con-sideration now, as likely to affect the future success of some of the schemes.2. The principal features of the period of work under review are. consolidation and practical progress on previously reported schemes and, whereas during the initial period my immediate stall was largely employed on questions of policy and the preparatory work on proposals, the progress made during the second period has
involved a growing volume of detailed administrative and executive work. The formulation of further proposals is, of course, proceeding alongside the actual operation of schemes, but I think it is wise to emphasise the changes in the character of the work in order to obviate any misconception of the progress made which might arise from a simple examination of the record of financial commitments. During the first period many of the schemes reported were in the final stages of preparation. Now, however, the very large majority have been in actual operation for a con-sideration time.I hope it will be apparent, after a perusal of the following report, that the rate of expenditure is not a true criterion either of the work accomplished or of the general improvement in the Special Areas thus far which has been brought about by active collaboration between the various Departments, Authorities, Organisations and individuals with whom it has been my privilege to work.2. Industrial and Employment Situation in the Special Areas.3. By arrangement with the Ministry of Labour, I am regularly receiving valuable detailed reports as to the trend of the various industries in the Special Areas and statistics showing the changes in the employment position. This information which is specially prepared shows a satisfactory all-round improvement in industrial activity, including the basic industries of Iron and Steel, Ship-building and Engineering and, in a smaller degree, Coal Mining. There is also an encouraging ^improvement in the lighter industries in the Area, the importance of which has sometimes been over-shadowed by the worldwide fame of the local heavy trades. While the facts clearly support my previous contention that the area has the will and ability to return to its former prosperity and industrial importance, I regret that the number of unemployed persons still remains extremely high in certain important districts. (A statement showing the Live Register of Unemployed Persons registered at the Employment Exchanges in the Scottish Special Area during the twelve months to 31st December, 1935, is attached Appendix 1.)Not only is it apparent that very large industrial developments will be necessary to cause a satisfactory reduction in these figures, but (as reported elsewhere-para. 46), I have been concerned with the problems of the suitability and availability of workers in certain instances to take advantage of increased opportunities of employment arising from the further revival which I confidently anticipate.4. In spite of the encouraging tendencies in the area, I am still paying particular attention to the question of the permanent surplus and certain of the schemes reported below are specially designed to cope with this problem. It is, however, satisfactory to note that the fall in the general Live Register has been accompaniedX   14208 A 3I:I
by a fall in the number of men who have experienced prolonged unemployment. This fact indicates that industrial development still remains the principal cure for unemployment and must therefore, constitute an important feature of my future operations.PART II.General Progress of Schemes.1. Industrial Development.(a) General.5. I am glad to report that the plans which were either formulated or foreshadowed in my previous report have progressed satisfactorily during the period now under review and it is encouraging to observe that the efforts to stimulate existing industries and to attract new developments have been accompanied and assisted by a revival through normal causes, particularly in the basic industries which have a high employment value.Operations in connection with Industrial Development have continued in close collaboration with the Scottish National Development Council and I cannot emphasise too strongly the value of a representative body of this kind as a co-ordinating link and means of promoting or assisting schemes for the benefit of all industries, for undertaking general industrial investigations and distributing information. In the following sections I refer to certain other general questions of importance under appropriate headings and record progress of particular schemes.(b) Publicity.6. The permanent exhibition of the products of the Scottish Special Areas organised by the Scottish National Development Council at British Industries House, London, has been continued during the period and the record of inquiries received and information distributed shows that the scheme has been of considerable benefit to local industry in its endeavours to obtain new and increased orders for its products. During the fatter part of the period arrange-ments were commenced for a series of special displays of Special Areas manufactures assisted by intensive publicity. In this matter, which will be reported upon further in subsequent reports, the Council has acted with the advice of the Department of Overseas Trade. A Special Areas Exhibit was also staged in connection with the Shipbuilding and Engineering Exhibition at Olympia during September, 1935.It is understood that enquiries continue to be received from industrialists in regard to factory sites and other information about the Special Areas and the Council has been able to make considerable use of the comprehensive records of industrial informa-tion specially compiled for this purpose. .
Arrangements are also in hand for a display of Scottish Special Areas products, as well as general publicity, at the British Industries Fair, 1936, at Olympia, London.The issues of &quot; Scotland,&quot; a peiiodical published by the Scottish National Development Council, have included during the year a number of interesting and informative supplements describing important branches of industry in the Special Areas.It is particularly gratifying to note that these efforts by the Council to distribute information about Special Areas industries have been followed by an increasing demand by individual industrial undertakings for inclusion in the Exhibition at British Industries House upon normal payment terms and this fact appears to me direct evidence of the value of the schemes, and to provide a large justification for the initial enterprise.(c) Industrial Investigations and Planning.7. In my previous Report I only ventured upon two suggestions for the consideration of the Government, the possible formation of an authoritative Scottish Body to assist economic planning and research and a possible method of financing new inventions or industrial enterprises.The latter suggestion is still under consideration but in regard to the former a considerable measure of discussion and investigation has been carried through by the Scottish Office and my own staff.f find that the idea has been accepted by the Government as one worthy of receiving close attention and, as the result of the further thought now given to the matter, I am hopeful that in the near future it will be possible to inaugurate a scheme which will, at least, afford an opportunity of testing, on practical lines, the value of the suggestion made.When this suggestion was first made I was aware that the Scottish National Development Council had undertaken a number of valuable inquiries, the reports of which are available.The functions of the Council, however, cover a very wide field on the industrial and commercial side. The new body if it is formed will, I hope, provide a closer link between the important work of the Council and that of the Depaitments of State and the Local Authori-ties and be in a peculiarly favourable position, with an expert staff, to study and encourage action upon the wider industrial and economic questions which at present extend beyond the scope of any of the above individually.f refer elsewhere in my report (paragraphs 9 and 20) to such questions as the siting for new housing in relation to industrial development, the clearance of industrial sites and in my previous report to the problem of clearing unsightly waste bings, the provision of special sei vices and facilities which do not fall solely within the functions of existing authorities. These and similar questions might form part of the duties of such a body as I have suggested, as well as the need for the orderly planning of new industrial developments themselves.
(d) Industrial facilities and services.8. As already publicly announced, a Departmental Committee was, at my suggestion, appointed by the Board of Trade to investigate the practical possibility of a scheme for regional Gas Supply in the West of Scotland.The operations of this Committee are outside the scope of my functions, but I am following the progress of their work with con-siderable interest. In so far as the Special Areas are concerned I have been anxious to provide any assistance which would facilitate the enquiries, but so far such assistance has not been necessary, apart from the valuable work carried out by Dr. Birkett Wylam to which reference was made in my previous report. His report and verbal evidence have been presented to the Committee.9. In connection with specific industrial proposals some pre-liminary enquiries have been undertaken, as to the possibility of offering help for the clearance of selected sites which are now ob-structed by derelict buildings, in order to facilitate the erection ol new factories without heavy initial charges for the promoters. I am not yet able to report the details of any scheme of this nature, but I have been impressed by certain bad examples of waste land in prominent industrial areas which create an impression of industrial dereliction. Such land is often in private ownership and it would be difficult for me in present circumstances to take any positive action to improve the sites without definite promise of subsequent deve-lopments, apart from the statutory limitations placed upon my office.No doubt the initial difficulties of making a clearance are similar to those presented by the problem of waste bings, principally considerations of cost, but I am of the opinion that it is a subject which might be examined in greater detail by an Economic Planning and Research Body, if, as I have suggested, such a Body is former!10. For some time past I have been paying particular attention to schemes for the creation of an industrial estate, fully equipped with buildings and services, under suitable arrangements as a means of attracting new industrial enterprises. I am now awaiting in-formation in response to my enquiries in regard to policy whici, I hope, will enable me to initiate formal negotiations at an early date.11. I am actively considering a scheme for the dredging ol Dumbarton Harbour which, in addition to providing improve! facilities for shipping and ship-building, will considerably improve a vacant site available for new development. Failure to keep the Harbour in serviceable condition is attributable to industrial depression.e)   Research, New Processes, etc.12. The programme of research into the properties of certain classes of mineral resources in the Special Areas has been continued during the period, and I have provided further assistance for tk extension of the enquiry into the properties of the extracted i
and other products. I wish to refer with great regret to the sad loss which Scottish science has sustained in the death of Professor Henry Briggs of Edinburgh University. It was wholly through his interest and under his direct guidance that the above work was undertaken as a development, in the interests of the Special Areas, of his work with the Scottish National Development Council in connection with their oil from Coal enquiries.It is satisfactory to note that this undertaking is continuing without interruption and laboratory tests are being followed by larger scale experiments.13. I have examined with special care a number of projected commercial undertakings for the extraction of oil and other products from coal as I am of the opinion that a suitable experiment on a commercial scale would afford valuable data to encourage an industrial development for which the area is peculiarly well suited. The matter is one of considerable difficulty and my investigations are continuing, having in mind the fact that I cannot by the terms of the Act under which I am operating offer direct assistance to an undertaking formed under ordinary commercial arrangements. Furthermore, I do not consider that I should be performing my proper functions unless I was satisfied that any scheme promoted with my help showed promise of results likely to have far-reaching effect. For this reason I have been obliged to reject some proposals which have been submitted to me with a view to financial&apos;assistance.14. I have received from a number of quarters proposals that should promote or assist schemes for de-watering in various parts of the Lanarkshire coalfield.   This problem has become more than purely industrial question in the Area and such facts as exist are overshadowed by conjecture and distorted by pure assumption.have found it necessary to reject a number of proposals that I should directly assist de-watering schemes which are often based upon a misconception of my functions, but I welcome the proposal made to me by the Scottish National Development Council that a comprehensive expert survey should be made by authorities whose eport would meet with general acceptance by all the interested parties. I have now offered a grant to the Council to meet the expenses of this survey and the preparation of a report. I under-stand that immediate steps are being taken by the Council to put the work in hand.15. During the period I have considered a number of proposals that I should assist in obtaining special preferences or concessions for some of the smaller local developments in the industrial field. There is already, I understand, a general preference in connection with Government contracts given to industries in the Special Areas, other things being equal, and, so far as the Scottish Special Areas re concerned, I am satisfied that, given adequate publicity in the rincipal markets, the industries will be able to obtain a satisfactory nd increasing demand for their products through an open and
expanding home market. In the course of enquiries made in one or two instances, however, I have observed a certain measure of reluctance on the part of users, particularly in Scotland itself, to try local products because this would involve a change from long established practice. I recognise fully the value of well-tried contacts, particularly in the industrial field, but, without endanger-ing these, I feel that there is room for a certain measure of experi-ment and trial on the part of consumers of all kinds.16. I am glad to record that through the joint efforts of the Scottish National Development Council and certain Local Authorities a small number of new industries have started in the Area recently. I hope that with expanding demand and the provision of the special facilities which I am endeavouring to encourage, further new industries will be started in the near future. The industries referred to above are concerned with the manufacture of building materials and I have received some enquiries regarding facilities for the establishment of a commercial aircraft factory which are still under investigation.2. Public Utility and Amenity Schemes.(a) Public Utility Schemes.17. Considerable progress has been made with the active co-operation of the Local Authorities on the approved public works schemes previously reported.At the date of my previous report 22 schemes had been approved and were actually in hand or about to commence. At the end of the present period, 36 schemes, involving a total expenditure of nearly  1,500,000, have been approved and in the large majority of cases have been actively in hand for at least several weeks. Particulars of schemes are shown in Appendix II.The Public Utility schemes are in most cases concerned with Sewage disposal or Water Supply, as in both these respects the Area is defective. As I have previously stated, I regard the provision of modern services as a first essential for industrial development and I may particularly add that I have satisfied myself that every assisted scheme is urgent on grounds of public health and to assist economic development.A large number of other schemes involving the expenditure of considerable sums have been submitted to me. Some of these are still under active consideration, but I regret that in important instances I have felt it necessary to regard the proposals as failing to qualify for assistance. Such decisions have generally been reached on the ground that the particular schemes can be carried out without financial assistance and without serious aggravation of the local burdens.Practically all these schemes have been sound and desirable in themselves and the Local Authorities concerned have invariably displayed a proper spirit and understanding of the need for progress by deciding to carry out the projects without help.
445I particularly wish to emphasise that my direct efforts to effect improvements in the Area have, throughout my operations, been notably supported and supplemented by the work of the Local Authorities and their officials.(b) Amenity Schemes.18. As shown in Appendices II and III, a number of specially selected schemes for the provision of recreation grounds, swimming pools and other amenities are either approved or under active consideration. This matter is not without difficulty and I have been obliged to reject a number of proposals after careful exam-ination of the details submitted, either owing to doubts as of the special urgency of the schemes or to my inability to accept the plea that unaided completion is impracticable.The provision of facilities for recreation and other amenities is in my opinion generally a question for the local community. Accordingly, my help has been limited to cases where a combination of special local circumstances, including the aftermath of abandoned industries, has produced drab or unsightly conditions which may interfere with new economic and industrial developments, or where the lack of provision may seriously affect the health and welfare of the industrial population.(c) Special Public Services and Works.19. Proposals for the provision of large scale General and Special Hospitals have been submitted to me with a view to obtaining financial assistance, and these are being examined in consultation with the Department of Health for Scotland.I do not consider that it will be possible for me to provide assist-ance for this important service except in selected cases, and it appears to me essential that any scheme submitted should make full provision for an extensive area in accordance with modern requirements, without undue regard to administrative boundaries.It is my intention, if it is found possible to work out a scheme, to ensure that adequate provision is made for an Early Treatment Mental Ward and Clinic as being an essential part of a modern General Hospital.I am also acting in consultation with the Department of Health for Scotland in examining the question of maternity services with a view to ascertaining whether some assistance is desirable, on an experimental basis, in an attempt to reduce infant and maternal mortality.20. In connection with Housing schemes, I have been requested by one important Local Authority to furnish information regarding future industrial development as some guide to them in selecting sites for new housing. This question is of material moment in certain parts of Lanarkshire where the coal-mining and other in-clustries have undergone considerable changes. It has not bee^i possible to supply useful facts and I am strongly of the opinion that
organised attempts to study the future economic trend on a regional basis should form part of the functions of the authoritative planning and research body, the formation of which I refer to above (paragraph 7).Without some provision of this kind for advance planning, there is always the grave danger of perpetuating unemployment in the housing areas through their relative inaccessibility to the principal centres of industry and of creating what may become the derelict villages of the future.21. In consultation with the Scottish Education Department, I have made some study of the Library Service in the Special Areas. Generally speaking, the Local Authorities have paid special attention to this important provision for the social welfare of the prople, but I am considering further a small number of cases which are unlikely to be dealt with now by the Authorities concerned in view of present commitments, unless they receive some special encouragement.3. Land Developments.(a) General:22. This question which, in my opinion, constitutes an important factor in dealing with the problem of the permanent industrial surplus of labour, has received a full measure of attention during the period, ft is a matter of considerable regret to me that the initial difficulty in acquiring suitable land for the purpose of my various schemes, including certain negotiations which proved abortive after a protracted period, has considerably delayed the inauguration of important parts of my programme.It is, however, satisfactory to note that such schemes as had commenced have made considerable progress and that I have now been able to acquire sufficient land for initial experiments on certain novel lines. Thioughout the period the Department of Agriculture for Scotland has continued to provide valuable assistance or has undertaken direct responsibility for certain of these schemes.(b) Land Reclamation :23. I have arranged with the Macaulay Institute for Soil Research, Aberdeen, to conduct an experimental reclamation of peat and waste land attached to Woodend Farm, Carstairs, which 1 have acquired for the purpose of reclamation and subsequent development as an improved experimental farming Unit. The farm has a total acreage of 941 and the Institute will endeavour to demonstrate by practical experiment the possibility of improving and extending an existing unit. The case is typical of many farms in Scotland and the experiment, if successful, should provide valuable data upon which the economic value of more extensive operations of this nature may be judged.(c) Arterial Drainage Schemes :24. Following the extension, upon my recommendation, of the Land Drainage (Scotland) Act, 1930, the Department of Agriculture
for Scotland have completed plans and initiated a scheme designed to check flooding of the River Clyde in the Carstairs district of Lanarkshire. Public announcements in respect of this scheme have already been made. The cost of this scheme will be borne by the Department, though it is anticipated that certain benefits will accrue to Lampits Farm, Carstairs, which is in my possession.The Department have also been acting in close collaboration with me in surveying other parts of the Special Areas in connection with land developments. General proposals are still under con-&apos; sideration. Although the time limit which is placed upon my own operations by the Special Areas Act may prevent the completion of many comprehensive proposals, I have maintained the long-term principle in the hope that preparatory work, even if it is on an ambitious scale, may in the end, after the expiry of my present term of office, further the objects for which I was appointed.(d) Experimental Farm Development:25. After negotiations to acquire other properties had broken down I was able in November to acquire and take possession of the Calderwood Estate, a farming property of about 850 acres situated between High Blantyre and East Kilbride. Plans are being actively formulated for its development as a subject for intensive cultivation. The details of this scheme will be reported in due course, but I may now say that one of my objects is to introduce as an experiment a means of absorbing into agricultural employment former industrial workers who, after prolonged unemployment, have little hope of a return to their former employment and who may not be expected to succeed as independent tenants on small holdings, etc. My plans will provide for the necessary training in agricultural work of unskilled men. It is also my intention to include certain modern farming developments in order to test their production and employment value.(e) Land Settlement: Small Holdings :26. The scheme for the settlement of unemployed plot-holders on small holdings under the control of the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, which was previously reported, has now been in progress for some time and the arrangements are working smoothly.As further holdings become available, the Department is increasing the number of families settled and it is anticipated that the initial programme for the settlement of 70 families, will be completed without difficulty.The selection of settlers is being made in collaboration with the Unemployment Assistance Board, who have made satisfactory arrangements for the payment of allowances during the period of training, and assisted the scheme in other ways.The special training staff paid from the Special Areas Fund has been appointed by the Agricultural Colleges by arrangement with the Department of Agriculture.
I attach considerable importance to this scheme, which provides a definite opening for unemployed men who have already proved their interest in land cultivation, and while I recognise the need for controlling the rate of settlement in order to obviate failure, I am hopeful that the scheme will demonstrate a method by which a gradual but continuous transfer of the best unemployed men into a state of useful and profitable independence can be effected.(f) Unemployed Plots Schemes :27. The provision of loans to plot-holders for the acquisition of additional stock, etc., which was previously reported, has been arranged through the Joint Committee of the Scottish National Union of Allotment Holders and Society of Friends. Out of the 500 second-year holders in the Special Areas who were expected to take advantage of this scheme, over 200 have already received loans and a further 200 applications have been received which are still under consideratiFn by the Committee.The scheme for the provision of plots for unemployed men is under the control of the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, and I have not regarded it as either practicable or necessary for me to take a principal part in the valuable work already being under-taken. The scheme of loans, however, has afforded additional encouragement to established holders which may enable them in many cases to obtain some partial subsistence from their work and improve their economic circumstances. I shall be prepared to consider an extension of this scheme during the coming year if this proves necessary to make provision for further plot-holders in the Special Areas who reach the qualifying period of one year&apos;s successful cultivation.(g) Allotment Schemes :28. I regard the allotment of from one-sixteenth to one-quarter of an acre as one of the most important contributions to the main-tenance of social well-being among unemployed persons, and I am therefore particularly glad to record that nearly 800 additional allotments have been established in the Special Areas under the scheme carried out on my behalf by the Joint Committee of the Scottish National Union of Allotment Holders and Society of Friends. To carry out the programme as an addition to their normal work, the Joint Committee appointed a number of additional organi-sers and supervisors with assistance from the Special Areas Fund. The Committee is to be congratulated upon the above result, which would have been even more striking if it had been possible to acquire more land in the districts where an unsatisfied demand for allotments still exists. ,My own officers concerned with the acquisition of land have undertaken special searches for land and given assistance with negotiations on behalf of the Joint Committee and local Allotment Associations and, while difficulties have been removed and satis-factory terms arranged by this means in a number of cases, further
15Mlefforts are being made. As far as possible, it has been considered desirable to arrange for leasing of land on comparatively short terms by local Associations, but I have set aside an adequate sum for the purchase of land on behalf of the Joint Committee in excep-tional cases where the former arrangement is impracticable.I think it right that I should mention the public-spirited action of a well-known landowner in the West of Scotland who in termina-ting the lease of an area of land occupied by an Allotment Association which he required for other purposes, provided an alternative site for the Association with adequate time for the transfer of the allot-ments without loss to the holders.In view of the immense social benefits which accrue to unemployed persons by the cultivation of an allotment, I would particularly appeal to all owners of land in the Scottish Special Areas to consider whether they can offer to the Joint Committee or a local Association any land which may not immediately be required for other purposes, on terms which will be within the means of the unemployed occupants. Land of this kind is particularly required near the larger centres of population.In connection with the development of Carfin Hall, New Stevenston, as a social service centre (which is reported elsewhere  paragraph 38), a successful allotment Association with a membership of 22 unemployed men has been formed in the walled-in kitchen garden. This scheme forms a part of the general development at Carfin Hall but qualifies for the usual facilities offered by the Joint Committee.(h) Special Experiment in Homecrofting :29. At the date of my previous report, arrangements were being completed for the establishment of a Homecroft Demonstration Centre at Lampits Farm, Carstairs.The Centre was taken over from the Ministry of Labour and a special staff was engaged to administer a training course for a period of six months, during which instruction is being given in the various craft and agricultural activities included in the Homecroft scheme as expounded by Professor J. W. Scott. The men recruited for this course were principally older married men who had suffered from prolonged unemployment and in order to obviate administrative difficulties, the methods of recruitment, payment of allowances to both the men and their families and other arrangements followed closely those made by the Ministry of Labour and Unemployment Assistance Board in respect of their residential training centres. Both these Departments have given valuable advice and assistance in operating the scheme.The administrative arrangements were completed and the first course commenced in September, 1935. The large number of men who applied were interviewed by a selection panel and an explana-tion of the nature of the scheme was given. The number of men attending the first course which is still running has remained fairly
steady at just under 60 and it is satisfactory to note that the few men who have been obliged to leave have done so in order to take up employment, for family or similar reasons and generally with obvious regret.Tuition in the various activities and principles of Homecrofting has been given by a staff of instructors under the general direction of Professor J. W. Scott and the aim throughout has been to afford the men the necessary experience in the production of useful articles, essential foodstuffs and agricultural produce and to demonstrate the principles of the system of group production and distribution with the object of enabling the men to apply it in actual homecroft groups in their own districts after the completion of the course, whenever it is found possible to establish them.While this demonstration of the Homecrofting system is still definitely in the experimental stage and Groups have not yet been formed, I am glad to note that the course at Lampits Farm is proving to be a valuable means of re-conditioning and affording new interest for older men who have suffered exceptionally from un-employment and this in itself is fully justifying the adoption of the scheme.I am now making arrangements with a view to the early establish-ment of a series of actual Homecroft centres to enable men who have completed the course to apply the knowledge they have gained and undertake actual group production. Land for this purpose has been obtained at Wishaw and the search is being pursued in other districts. Plans of buildings and equipment are being prepared by my technical staff.Steps are also being taken to establish a model Homecroft centre at Lampits Farm with the object of facilitating instruction in the essentials of the system and assisting the co-ordination of the various activities in the centre.Throughout the period the whole scheme has been watched with special care by Sir William Goodchild, my Assistant Com-missioner, and both he and other Senior Officers have undertaken much onerous detailed work in order to ensure that the experiment is fully recorded and continued upon lines which appear to be most practicable and likely to produce successful results, having in view all the difficult local conditions which have to be overcome in putting theory to the test of practice.I am not yet in a position to express a view as to the ultimate fate of this scheme, but the ideas involved appear to be of sufficient interest to justify giving the experiment a full trial.(i)   Special schemes of Land Development :30. In association with the Departments of Health and Agri-culture, I have given preliminary consideration to a comprehensive scheme of land development which, if adopted, would considerably facilitate an extension of settlement on Small Holdings and ex-perimental schemes of the types to which I have already referred
above. The scale of the operations contemplated would un-doubtedly involve special arrangements and consideration of these proposals is continuing.4. Social Service Schemes.(a) General.31. I have endeavoured during the period under review to extend my operations for the social improvement of the Special Areas over as wide a field as possible, acting wherever possible through approved voluntary organisations concerned in various aspects of social welfare. While I have been extremely fortunate in obtaining valuable assistance from a number of important bodies such as the Scottish Council for Community Service during Unemployment and others which are specifically mentioned in the appropriate section of my report, there seems to be a want in the Special Areas of Scotland of some further organisation of social welfare work particularly in the matter of obtaining voluntary assistance and support which is generally necessary to ensure a continuous development of this class of work. I attribute the present difficulty partly to the fact that most of the cities and larger centres of population have taken independent action with considerable energy in these matters and have so thoroughly utilised the services of voluntary workers and the offers of help from their own communities that the other less compact districts, often mainly consisting of an industrial population, have been quite unable to obtain either services or financial help in this respect.One of the results of the present situation is that I have been obliged to initiate consideration of some of the pressing social welfare needs of the Special Areas which are already fully catered for elsewhere and in certain instances my own staff have administered schemes which could more appropriately have been placed under the control of voluntary workers or organisations able to concentrate their whole energies upon the particular work.(b) Social Welfare Work for Children.32. I have been impressed by the need for a considerable extension of the provision of Play Centres for school children, Toddlers&apos; playgrounds and schemes similar to those which are established in some of the cities. In the absence of an organisation able to formulate proposals in respect of the Special Areas, I made arrangements with the Department of Health for Scotland and the Scottish Education Department to convene a joint conference with representatives of the Local Authorities with the object of encouraging-ing local examination of the problem and stimulating voluntary efforts. I am now awaiting information as to the results of local action and I venture to hope that sufficient interest will be aroused to ensure the formulation of proposals which can be put into effect
with assistance where necessary. I have particularly urged the creation of one or more regional organisations to deal with this question in preference to small local bodies as a better guarantee of comprehensive arrangements on approved lines.In connection with the development of Carfin Hall, New Stevens-ton, as a comprehensive Social Service Centre, reported elsewhere, the Warden has already made arrangements to inaugurate a Toddlers&apos; playground which, while providing a service for the particular locality, may prove useful as an experiment, and for demonstration purposes. In this case the provision of accommodation and essential equipment through the Special Areas Fund has encouraged sufficient voluntary support and service to render the scheme practicable.(c) Welfare Work of Adolescents.33. Under the general guidance of Mr. G. E. Troup, Secretary of the Scottish Juvenile Welfare Office, all the Youth organisations to whom I have offered grants have been able to make satisfactory progress in the provision of additional welfare facilities for unemployed adolescents. These facilities include recreational and cultural clubs, camping arrangements and special assistance in obtaining kit and equipment for unemployed boys and girls who wish to join the Scout or Guide movement, in order to place them on an equal footing with their more fortunate fellows. New troops, companies and clubs have been started by this means and there has also been a satisfactory development of existing schemes pre-viously restricted through lack of funds.Provision has also been made for extending the facilities for the training of leaders for which in all the organisations there is an insistent demand.During the period, I have approved the appointment of a special physical training organiser who will give assistance to all the Girls&apos; Organisations in an endeavour to develop this valuable and popular activity. I am glad to say that this organiser, who is a skilled gymnast, is making rapid progress and is collaborating closely with my Chief Instructor for Men&apos;s and Women&apos;s Classes, reported upon below.In view of the above remarks, I should particularly like to emphasise that the existence of large regional organisations for the welfare of adolescents has considerably facilitated developments on a comprehensive scale. Special arrangements have been made through Mr. Troup to co-ordinate the work of all organisations and to dispose of common problems by joint discussions and Mr. Troup&apos;s personal efforts have contributed materially to the progress made. It is also worthy of note that the assistance I have been able to give has in each case been supplemented by the large amount of voluntary support which these bodies are able to command. Thus the important voluntary principle is preserved without difficulty.
(d) Physical Culture of Men and Women.34. The scheme which was inaugurated with the active co-operation of the Ministry of Labour at the beginning of my opera-tions was fully reported upon in my previous report. It has proved so popular that I have decided to provide assistance for the formation of physical culture classes for unemployed men and women in all parts of the Special Areas where there is a sufficiently large demand. At the present time 29 classes for men and 3 classes for women are in operation under skilled instructors and further classes are in process of formation in response to a specific demand. Since the inauguration of the scheme 4,185 men and 167 women have enrolled and the Live roll at the end of December, 1935, was 2,098 men and 74 women. New recruits are constantly applying through the Employment Exchanges to fill the places of those who have been obliged to discontinue their attendance. It is specifically stated that practically all those who leave the classes do so to take up employment and I am more than ever convinced that the classes are an important contributory factor in this success.This scheme has attracted the interest of many local authorities and representative members of the community, and I am par-ticularly glad to note^that public displays have been organised and successfully carried out on the initiative of the instructors and classes themselves, without either special encouragement or help from me.I should like to make special mention of the spirit displayed by the instructors which has contributed in no small measure to the success of the scheme. Special emphasis must also be laid upon the valuable work performed by the Chief Instructor, Captain Lamb, the support of the Employment Exchange Managers, and finally the services rendered by Mr. H. Gosling of Ministry of Labour, Scottish Divisional Office. Mr. Gosling has exercised direct control over all the operations in collaboration with my office and has been untiring in his efforts to make the scheme successful.(e) Community Service Centres.35. The scheme for the establishment of a number of model occupational centres and community service clubs, previously reported, has made considerable progress as a result of the efforts of the Scottish Council for Community Service during Unemployment. A number of representative local committees were formed with the help of special organisers who Were appointed by the Council with a grant from my Funds. These committees have now prepared detailed plans for twelve model centres which have been approved and are being put into effect, and plans in a number of other cases are well advanced. I am glad to report that all the localities where these centres are to be established have undertaken to accept responsibility for maintenance and operations. Hence I have been able to maintain
the principle that my assistance is intended to be a foundation for local effort,, or to supply a means of lifting from a distressed locality the burden of heavy initial expenditure which hitherto has rendered the establishment of a satisfactory centre impossible.36. I have adopted the practice of referring to the Scottish Council a number of applications for assistance received from existing social and community service clubs in various parts of the Special Areas. In cases where the Council recommend assistance, and where the activities of the particular club do not conflict with those of other bodies, I propose to consider the applications sympathetically.37. I have received preliminary details of an interesting attempt by the Greenock Community Service Council and the Town Council, acting in association with the Scottish Council, to form both a large-scale model Community Service Centre and outdoor recreational centre as one comprehensive scheme. Plans for this scheme have reached an advanced stage and I now await their submission for my consideration. If the scheme is put into effect it will provide a novel example in Scotland of what may be described as a civic leisure centre. It is, however, right to say that local authorities generally have offered both support and practical assistance to the voluntary organisations engaged with the establishment of model centres, (f) Special Residential and Community Service Centre.38. During the period under review considerable progress has been made with plans for the establishment of a large-scale residential and local community service centre at Carfin Hall, New Stevenston, particulars of which were given in my previous report. The residen-tial Warden, Mr. R. J. S. Reid, and a nucleus staff under the direct control of my ofhce during the interim period have been able to inaugurate a variety of new activities for the local community with the active assistance of an increasing body of voluntary workers. Both indoor and outdoor facilities have been provided for occupational, cultural and recreational purposes, and these have developed with considerable success in spite of exceptional difficulties due to the preparations for the permanent scheme, including drastic alterations and repairs to the property.Noteworthy examples of assistance during this initial period are the valuable contributions of material support and voluntary personal service made by the Special Areas Auxiliary Service, an organisation specially formed for tire purpose by the Joint Com-mittee of the Edinburgh Branch of the National Council of Women and the Edinburgh Women Citizen&apos;s Association and by the Students of Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities, who arranged a Work and Talk Conference at Carfin Hall during the winter vacation. The object of the latter scheme was mutual assistance in the improve-ment of the homes of the unemployed in the vicinity of the Hall by combined work of students and unemployed men, and an exchange of views and experiences. During this conference the students resided at the Hall at their own expense.
While these valuable temporary efforts have materially assisted the ultimate purpose of the scheme they have necessarily remained on a restricted scale.Throughout the period the representative organising Committee under the able chairmanship of Mr. R. Bryce Walker, Joint County Clerk of Lanarkshire, and a well-known social worker, has been actively engaged in formulating the permanent scheme which is intended to add to a model local centre a residential scheme for training community service leaders and other developments to extend the influence of the Hall over a wide field. The proposals are now undergoing a final examination and I anticipate that the new developments will be placed under the control of a permanent Governing Body in the near future. I propose that my assistance should be supplemented by a widespread appeal for voluntary financial or other assistance, and I venture to hope that the scheme will attract the notice of all public-spirited Scotsmen as an oppor-tunity of acquiring for Carfin Hall influence and fame similar to that enjoyed by Toynbee Hall in London.Although no appeal for assistance has yet been issued, f am particularly glad to record that I have already received from a generous donor, who desires to remain anonymous, the sum of  100 as a contribution to the development of Carfin Hall.These examples of practicai interest, to which must be added the service given and practical interest displayed by large numbers of unnamed members of the community, including many un-employed persons, encourage me in the belief that the scheme v/ill eventually make a material contribution to the social improvement of the Special Areas, and it may be hoped to Scotland as a whole.(g) Nursing Services.39. The scheme for improving Nursing Services in the Special Areas through the agency of the Queen&apos;s Institute of District Nursing has worked most satisfactorily. A careful examination was made of all necessitous cases and additional facilities have been completed through the Institute in practically every case.A number of additional proposals in connection with district nursing have been received during the operation of this scheme, and these are being examined with a view to their adoption, if con-sidered practicable. The Department of Health for Scotland, in addition to affording advice in the above matter, have been in close consultation with me regarding such important questions as maternal welfare and other health and medical questions, and I have in-dicated my desire to consider any suggestions for new or improved services, which either experimentally or otherwise may be specially worthy of application.(h) Holiday Camps for Unemployed Persons.40. The grant offered to the Scottish Council for Community Service during Unemployment to assist them in providing a holiday for unemployed families from the Special Areas has enabled the
Council to organise a scheme which achievedaremarkablesuccess. The camps, which were originally intended to provide a holiday of one week for about 300 families of men who had experienced prolonged unemployment, accommodated over 1,000 families and approxi-mately 5,000 individuals during the twelve weeks in which they were opened. Arrangements were made to enable the unemployed men, paying their own full expenses, to take their families at reduced charges, and only the deficiency on account of the wives and children is payable from the grant offered.From every quarter there have been nothing but the most favourable comments upon this experiment, and while I am not yet able to report finally on the financial aspects of the scheme, particulars available indicate that it is worthy of repetition on as large a scale as possible. I particularly commend this scheme to members of the community who may be able to offer some financial assistance to the Scottish Council.I have had the advantage of obtaining the personal views of many of the men and their families and the encouragement and happiness which it has afforded them is so remarkable that I cannot commend it too strongly. The participants were still discussing it months after the experience. There is no doubt that a large measure of credit for the exceptional success of this scheme is due to the organisers, voluntary workers and staff appointed by the Council to carry it out.Several of the Youth organisations were also able to arrange holiday camps for young persons as a part of their programme of work for the Special Areas.(i) Other Social Welfare Schemes.41. I have offered a grant for administration through the Scottish Council for Community Service, to the National Union of ToWnswomen&apos;s Guilds, to assist them in the extension of the club movement among women in the Special Areas.42. An application has been received from the Scottish Council for Women&apos;s Trades and Careers for assistance from the Special Areas Fund in connection with their scheme for placing girls in domestic employment on farms! This application is being actively considered.43. In connection with the voluntary assistance given to Carfin Hall by the Special Areas Auxiliary Service (referred to in paragraph 38) I have offered a small grant to this body to assist in meeting the travelling expenses of regular voluntary workers, who, in addition to expending a large amount of time on this service, have been obliged to travel long distances. This grant is a contribution towards funds which have been voluntarily subscribed. The workers from this service have organised and are conducting regular art and craft classes and have provided a large amount of equipment and similar help,   The situation of Carfin Hall in the midst of
unrelieved industrial depression creates a special demand for assistance from more distant areas. Indeed, the case of Carfin Hall affords one further illustration of the general problem to which I referred in my comments on the organisation of social welfare schemes in Scotland (paragraph 31).5. Financial Commitments44. Particulars of the anticipated expenditure on schemes re-ferred to in the foregoing report are given under appropriate headings in Appendix II.In Appendix III a record is furnished of all specific schemes still under consideration in which financial commitments are likely to be involved. It should, of course, be explained that a number of other proposals under consideration are necessarily excluded from the tables owing to the fact that they have not reached the stage at which they can be regarded as more than preliminary suggestions for general examination.In considering the financial aspect of my operations, I have been particularly impressed by the fact that some of the work which offers special promise of far-reaching benefits has involved little or no expenditure from the Special Areas Fund. This generally applies to plans for industrial development such as the Gas Grid, industrial research, etc. Often the need for financial assistance has been removed by the willingness of industrial organisations, Local Authorities and others to undertake the financial responsi-bility, and I regard this as a very encouraging sign that those con-cerned with the Special Areas still fully appreciate the value of enterprise and resist the rather easy temptation to throw off their own responsibilities. Owing to the existence of this spirit, it has been easier for me to maintain my position as a collaborator with other agencies in a joint effort. In affording assistance to schemes of all kinds, I have borne specially in mind the temporary character of my office.6. General45. The specific schemes reported above represent the large proportion of my work during the period, but I have also had before me a number of general problems which do not admit of purely local solution. In such cases, I have endeavoured to obtain as much local information as possible by enquiry and have then referred the questions with a report to the appropriate Departments or Authorities for such action as they may consider possible.46. One of the important problems dealt with in this manner is that of the supply of labour for industry, notably for coal-mining, shipbuilding and the other basic trades. Such a problem, which arises principally from industrial changes and the effect of unemploy-ment during the prolonged depression is obviously extremely compli-cated, and my experience clearly shows that it would have been
far more complex but for the existence of the National Employment Exchange Service with its unbroken chain of offices able to mobilise workers for demands all over the country. I am of the opinion that the problem of labour supply could be appreciably diminished if this Service, which already performs remarkable work in satisfying labour requirements, Was called in to assist all employers. There appears to be, however, a residual problem of potential labour shortages through unsuitability owing to changed industrial conditions which even the Employment Exchanges cannot solve. There is unques-tionably a definite responsibility upon individual employers to recognise the situation and to take measures to meet it, and I venture to suggest that the matter is of sufficient general moment to justify more comprehensive examination, in order to ensure that unemploy-ment which can be attributed to unsuitability of the labour supply is reduced to an absolute minimum.7. Conclusion.47. I would like to emphasise that the period under review has been largely devoted to getting into practical operation many of the schemes adumbrated or commenced during the first six months of my term of office.This in itself has thrown a great amount of work on my staff and upon the staffs of the various Departments of State who continue to co-operate with and assist me with an enthusiasm for which I am truly grateful.At the same time, much thought as well as active investigation has been devoted to exploring new avenues of development, but it must be understood that when the more or less obvious improvements are under way the larger and often more debateable schemes take definitely a longer time to develop.Undoubtedly the situation in the Scottish Special Areas shows definite signs of alleviation, reflecting the improvement in trade in the country generally, and while I would in no way arrogate to myself any credit for this improvement, there can be no doubt that there has been introduced a measure of confidence, possibly largely psychological, owing to the steps taken by the Government through my office to get at close grips with the problems.1 continue to enjoy the loyal and effective support of my relatively small but most enthusiastic and efficient staff.f have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Commissioner for the Special Areas 13 Carlton Terrace, in Scotland,Edinburgh, 7. &amp;h February, 1936,
