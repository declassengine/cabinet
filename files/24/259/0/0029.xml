-    355THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1936.SECRET. Copy No.G.P. 29 (36)CABINET.PROPOSED BROADCASTS BY THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION OF A SERIES OF TALKS ON FASCISM AND COMMUNISM.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs.IN August last the Postmaster-General drew the attention of the Foreign Office to a proposal by the B.B.C. to broadcast a series of talks under the general title of &quot; The Citizen and his Government/&apos; in which Sir Oswald Mosley and Mr. Pollitt, among others, were to propound the political and social theories of Fascism and Communism respectively. My predecessor agreed with Major Tryon that these two talks were open to serious objection, since they could not, in the nature of things, be dispassionate descriptions of the Fascist and Communist experiments, but, however carefully censored, would amount to propaganda by the leaders of parties advocating the forcible overthrow of the Constitution; and in the case of the Communist broadcast at least, it could not be maintained that such propaganda could be tolerated because it was bound to be ineffective on the contrary, Communist propaganda, though probably ineffective in this country, remains a considerable danger in other parts of the Empire, particularly India.To permit a Communist leader to broadcast, moreover, would prove a serious embarrassment to His Majesty&apos;s Government in any future representations which they might have to make to the Soviet Government on the subject of Communist propaganda. The Soviet Government are already inclined to reply to such representations by pointing out that it is open to His Majesty&apos;s Government to protect themselves; and they would not fail to make effective use of the admission of Communist propaganda into the programme of an organisation under Govern-ment control. Only a few weeks previously His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Moscow had been instructed to protest strongly to them against references to this country in Dimitrov&apos;s speech at the 7th Congress of the Communist International  yet it was now proposed to allow a leader of the British Communist party, who had identified himself with Dimitrov&apos;s views, to propagate similar views to millions of listeners, both in this country and abroad, through the medium of an organisation which they and the world in general, believe (however wrongly) to be a mouthpiece of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Similarly, as regards Sir Oswald Mosley&apos;s broadcast, it might be undesirable, in view of the Abyssinian crisis, to encourage propaganda by a man who was known to be in close touch or sympathy with Signor Mussolini. The B.B.C. maintained that, as the talks on Fascism and Communism would be followed by three others by representatives of the three major parties in Parliament, they would be counteracted by these latter. That, however, would be a further complication from the Foreign Office point of view, for since the later talks would have to deal faithfully with conditions in Italy and the Soviet Union, objection would almost certainly be taken to them by those countries.8344   [12698]
The B.B.C. were accordingly asked to delete from their programme the two items in question. They refused to do this, but finally agreed to postpone the whole programme in view of the imminence of the general election; and it was hoped that they would take advantage of the postponement to withdraw the items without loss of face. On the 23rd January, however, they informed the Foreign Office that the programme of political talks had again come up for consideration and that, as the whole series had originally received the approval of their Governors, whose views had not changed, they felt unable to withdraw-any part of the programme on their own initiative. They have maintained this attitude, although it has been pointed out to them that the political situation still makes it undesirable to broadcast a discussion on Fascism, and that the objections to a Communist broadcast and to replies to both remain unanswered; but they have said that they would agree to withdraw the whole series if they could be authorised to issue a statement that &apos;&apos; they had been given to understand that the broadcasting of these talks would be an embarrassment to the Govern-ment&apos;&apos; or some similar form of words.Although it is still, of course, desirable that the B.B.C. should withdraw the objectionable items of their programme without bringing in His Majesty&apos;s Government, it seems impossible to induce them to do so; and if the talks are, in fact, withdrawn through Government intervention, it would seem difficult, and in any case undesirable, to refuse to permit them to say so. It would, however, be neither true nor desirable to state publicly that the talks &quot;would be an embarrassment to the Government &quot; at the present time; but it would be true to say that &quot; they would not be in the national interest.&quot; I accordingly request authority to permit the B.B.C. to make a statement in this form, if they insist on that procedure.A. E.Foreign Office, February 1, 1936
