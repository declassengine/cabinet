9 RConfidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated the 12th January, 1936, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1.    Numerous political conferences are as a general rule held during the Christmas holidays;    and Christmas, 1935* proved no exception.      It was also marked by the celebration of the Congress Jubilee.      Congress leaders had announced their wish that the celebrations should be on a non-party basis and hoped in this way to enlist the sympathy of the liberals and others who had severed their connection with Congress in disapproval of its unconstitutional and subversive policy.      Speeches delivered in the course of the celebrations were moderate in tone, and the President issued a carefully worded, but somewhat ambiguous, statement which was largely an academic advocacy of complete independence as the goal and the birthright of India.      It contained no direct attack on the Government and was in striking contrast with the highly seditious independence declaration issued for the first time in January, 1930* before the inauguration of civil disobedience.      it is significant, however, that the statement gave a prominent place in the list of the achievements of Congress to the &quot;legitimate and peaceful means&quot; adopted by the Congress since 1920,  (the year of the first Non Co-operation Movement) for the attainment of the goal, and pointed out that in their most acute form they included &quot;non-attendance, violent non co-operation and civil, i.e. non violent, resistance&quot;,&apos;a movement which, for reasons well known.to all, had been &quot;suspended&quot;.      It then went on to refer to its present policy of Council entry, to village reconstruction
9* &apos;-yand its other legitimate and beneficient activities, a statement designed to impress those who do not realise how singularly ineffective and half-hearted are the efforts of Congress workers in this respect.2.     Reports so far received show that celehrations aroused little enthusiasm or even interest.      The Government of Bombay report that even in Bombay city where, as the birth place of Congress, particular efforts were made, the public response must have been disappointing to organisers.      Reports to the same effect have been received from Madras, the Punjab, Assam and the Central Provinces.      In the United Provinces, press reports of the success of the celebrations are said to be very exaggerated, while the Government of Bihar and Orissa observe that, though in Patna a special effort was made to emphasise the non-party nature of the celebrations and crowds were attracted in this way, there is little evidence that the celebrations show any turn of public opinion in favour of Congress policy.      Certain other features of the celebrations   may be noted;      in some places, notably in Bombay and Madras, the-left wing asserted itself by severely criticising the Congress present policy or lack of policy;      local bodies which in the past have shown their sympathy with Congress, do not appear to have given the celebrations any general or marked measure of support; while the Muslims, with a few exceptions, refrained from taking any part in them. Thus in Bombay and districts, no Muslims took part except Mr. Shaukat Ali;    in Lahore, a Muslim speaker, while praising Congress ideals, criticised its pro-Hindu constitution, while :in Calcutta,., the celebrations lead
to a clash with some Muslims who were holding their Id festival at an adjacent mosque and objected to the celebrations as interfering with their prayers.3.    The Liberals held a conference at Nagpur which did not attract large numbers.      The speeches were on the usual lines and resolutions were passed urging the acceptance of office and the working of the Constitution in spite of its defects;      it was frankly recognised that a refusal to work the Constitution would not make it unworkable.h.    In Delhi, the Muslim League rejected a proposal that a Committee of the League should enquire into the Shahidganj dispute in Lahore, which was supported by the mover in a speech bitterly criticising the Punjab Government, but ultimately passed a resolution moved from the Chair by Mr, Jinnah asking the Government of India to hold an enquiry as the Council felt that the Punjab Government had mishandled the situation.      Prom Lahore itself the reports are more optimistic,  and it is particularly satisfactory to note a sharp reaction in Muslim opinion and a recognition of the fact that agitation is likely to lead nowhere and that it has got into the hands of professional agitators.5.    The Sikh agitation in regard to the temporary prohibition of the carrying of Kirpans in Lahore City still continues, but the Punjab Government have again made it clear that it would be wholly impracticable to leave one community armed while disarming members of all other communities;     and to admit the claim of the Sikhs would involve the surrender of the essential powers possessed by the District Magistrates of disarming any
section of the public during a time of serious disorder. The agitation takes the form of small &quot;bodies of Sikhs attempting to enter Lahore carrying large Kirpans;      the members are promptly arrested, deprived of their weapons and given a nominal punishment.      This action does not appear to have aroused any public sympathy for the Sikhs and as the disarming order will expire on January 31st, it is.unlikely, in the absence of any untoward incident, that the situation will cause any serious anxiety.      The firm policy adopted by the Punjab Government, which has the full support of the Government of India, has proved, successful in preventing serious disorder or any,spread of the agitation..
