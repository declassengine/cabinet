THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1936.Copy No.     38CABINET.PALESTINE.Legislative Council.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.AS my colleagues may wish to have some account of the steps which have been taken in the direction of the setting up of a Legislative Council in Palestine since this question was last brought before the Cabinet, and an appreciation of the present position, I am circulating a statement which is appended to this memorandum.2. At the same time, there are two important points of detail in connexion with the establishment of the proposed Legislative Council upon which I wish to consult the Cabinet, viz., (i) the question of the eligibility of women to sit as members of the Council; and (ii) the extent to which the proceedings in Legislative Council should be privileged.(i) Eligibility of Women to Sit as Members of the Council.3. In the minutes of the Cabinet meeting held on the 28th November, 1934, the Cabinet recorded the strong view that it would be a mistake to publish to the world that women should be excluded from the Council. This view was accordingly communicated by my predecessor to the High Commissioner, who said in his reply of the 8th January, 1935 : &quot; I do not anticipate that for many years to come the Moslem community of Palestine will elect, or will be content to see nominated to the Council, any Moslem women members. For that and other reasons I should have preferred to wait till the second election before conferring the right on any woman to sit on the Legislative Council.Such a right will certainly be displeasing both to the Arabs and traditionally religious Jews.None the less, in view of what you have now written, I will endeavour to get, if not approval, at least no strong opposition to this proposal in the course of my conversations; and I think that I shall be successful. I will, of course, keep you informed before arriving at any decision.&quot;The correspondence between my predecessor and the High Commissioner was circulated to the Cabinet, who took note of it at their meeting on the 6th February. 1935.4. This question was further considered during the personal discussions which took place this autumn between my predecessor and Sir Arthur Wauchope, who was then on leave of absence, and, at Mr. Malcolm MacDonald&apos;s request, the High Commissioner has privately ascertained the views of Dr. Weizmann. which he has now reported to me. Dr. Weizmann, while reaffirming that in any event the Jews would not consent to sit on the Council, has informed the High Commissioner that the Jews would not make a point of women having the right to sit. As an indication of the Jewish attitude, it may be noted that at the [12565]SECRET.CP. 2 (36).
date of Sir Arthur Wauchope&apos;s report (the 13th December, 1935) there were 109 candidates in the Tel-Aviv Municipal Election, not one of whom was a woman. The conclusion reached by Sir Arthur Wauchope is that it would be a great mistake to confer upon women this privilege, as the orthodox Jews and all Arabs would hate it, and no one much wants it.5. As regards voting, it should be noted that it has been decided that each community (Moslem, Jew and Christian) shall determine whether or not the women of that community are to be eligible to vote; but an arrangement of this kind would not be practicable as regards membership.6. My colleagues will appreciate that the admission of women to member-ship of the Legislative Council would be most distasteful to the Arabs as a whole and to the orthodox Jews, and Dr. Weizmann&apos;s opinion is that the Jews in general would not make a point of the right of women to sit in the Council. Considered, therefore, solely from the Palestine point of view, there.would be a strong case for accepting the High Commissioner^ recommendation. On the other hand, having regard to the feeling in this country, it would, in my opinion, be a serious political mistake for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take a decision in favour of the exclusion of women from the Council, and I feel bound to recommend that the High Commissioner should be informed that in the new Constitution for Palestine women should not be disqualified from membership of the Council.(ii) The extent to which the Proceedings in Legislative Council should be Privileged.7. The High Commissioner attaches great importance to ensuring so far as possible that any remarks made by members in the Council should not appear in the public press if they had been ruled out of order during debate, especially if ruled out on the ground of being likely, when published, to cause disaffection or to endanger the public peace. Owing to the fact that the language of debate may be either English, Arabic or, if the Jews should eventually decide to participate, Hebrew, it will in some cases be very difficult for the President of the Council to intervene in time to prevent remarks of such a character from being made in Arabic or Hebrew. All that he will be able to do in some cases will be to rule, as soon as they have been brought to his notice by being translated into English, that such remarks are inadmissible under the Order in Council or under the Standing Orders. But if such remarks, which might be of a seditious or inflammatory nature have, in fact, been made, the President&apos;s ruling would not prevent their publication as part of the proceedings of the Council. To meet this difficulty, the High Commissioner wishes to have approval for the following arrangement, to which he attaches great importance : (1) That there should be an official report of the proceedings in the Council which should be certified by the Chairman, who should have power to leave out from the report any part of the proceedings which he has ruled out of order.(2) That members of the Council should have absolute privilege for anythingsaid in the Council. (3) That outside the Council there should not be any privilege for reports ofthe proceedings of the Council in so far as those reports containmatters which, while in fact part of the proceedings of the Council,are not included in the official report.8. It is recognized that the procedure suggested above would be unusual and would be open to certain objections. It is fundamental to British conceptions that an accurate report of the proceedings in the Legislature should be privileged and that the people ought to know what is said and done in the Legislature. Moreover, there is the practical difficulty that newspapers would not safely be able to publish the proceedings in the Council till they have obtained the official report, which would involve delay.9. It is, however, necessary to have regard to the special conditions in Palestine, where the High Commissioner has wide statutory powers to suspend newspapers and to impose other penalties for the publication of matter likely, in his opinion, to endanger the public peace, and it has been recognized as essential
that the High Commissioner should possess these powers. Experience has shown that public feeling in Palestine is easily excited by the press, and it has been necessary for years past for the High Commissioner to make fairly frequent use of his powers to prevent popular excitement from being worked up to danger point by inflammatory articles or reports of speeches in newspapers. More than one Arab newspaper has been suspended for this reason during the last few weeks.10. If the press were free to publish with impunity inflammatory or seditious utterances, which, though ultimately ruled out of order, were, in fact, made in the Legislative Council, an easy way, would be open to the political agitator which he would be quick to use for sowing disaffection broadcast amongst the population of Palestine, and the public peace might be seriously endangered.11. I know that Sir Arthur Wauchope attaches the greatest importance, in the interests of good order, to the imposition of such restrictions on the publica-tion of the Council proceedings. The Arabs would, no doubt, object for obvious reasons, but on the other hand, the Jews should regard these restrictions as affording an important safeguard against the possible use of the Legislative Council for the purpose of inflaming public opinion amongst the Arabs against the Jewish National Home.12. It will be seen, therefore, that the Cabinet are asked to sanction a procedure that would subject us to all the criticism of interfering with the liberty of the press, would enable the one responsible for seditious utterance to be immune and would make the one that publishes guilty; in short, it would reverse the procedure always adopted under a free Constitution. But the Cabinet must carefully weigh these disadvantages, which may be made much of at home, against the practical difficulty which I have indicated and which is so strongly urged by the High Commissioner himself.(Initialled) J. H. T.Colonial Office,Downing Street,January 10, 1936.APPENDIX.1. At the meeting held on the 6th February, 1935, the Cabinet took note of a memorandum (CP. 25 (35)) circulated by the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, which covered copies of(a) a despatch sent to the High Commissioner for Palestine summarizing the conclusions reached in discussions with the Secretary of State and conveying the views of the Cabinet on those conclusions as expressed in the minutes of the meeting of the 28th November, 1934 (Cabinet Conclusions 43 (34)): and(&amp;) Sir Arthur Wauchope&apos;s reply.2. In accordance with assurances which he had full authority to give, Sir Arthur Wauchope had intended to commence preliminary conversations on the basis of the detailed proposals, for which approval had been given, with Arab and Jewish leaders in the summer of 1935. Strong representations had, however, in the meantime been made by Dr. Weizmann that detailed discussions should be postponed until after the Zionist Congress elections in August 1935. In deference to these representations, which had the support of my predecessor, Sir Arthur Wauchope agreed to postpone detailed discussions until after his return from his approaching leave of absence in this country. Nevertheless, in view of the assurances which he had given, he felt it necessary, prior to his -departure on leave, to have informal conversations of a strictly confidential
nature with the leaders of both communities, in which he briefly outlined the main features of the proposed Council and told the leaders that he would formally put forward definite and detailed proposals on his return from leave after he-had had further consultations with the Secretary of State.3. During the autumn, lengthy discussions took place between Sir Arthur Wauchope and my predecessor, as a result of which decisions were reached on various outstanding points of detail, and instructions as to these were sent to the High Commissioner for his guidance in his forthcoming conversations.4. In the meantime, various causes have led to increased manifestations of discontent on the part of Arab leaders in which the five principal political parties have acted together with unusual unanimity. The High Commissioner, who will keep me informed of any significant developments, hopes that the setting up of a Legislative Council in accordance with the pledges given by His Majesty&apos;s Government will go some way to check the growing antagonism felt by so many Arabs towards the mandatory power, and he decided to commence the long-deferred conversations on the detailed proposals for setting up the Council with the Arab leaders on the 21st December, and with the Jewish leaders on the 22nd December, when he explained fully the proposals which had been agreed upon. Sir Arthur Wauchope reports that the Arabs received the proposals in a critical spirit and showed that they did not consider that they went far enough in the direction of self-government, and that the Jews informed him unanimously and in categorical terms that, while they would continue to co-operate with the-Government in all other respects, they would not co-operate in the proposed Legislative Council.The High Commissioner^ statement to the Arab and Jewish leaders was. published in the Palestine press on the 23rd December.Sir Arthur Wauchope considers that there is a possibility that some of the Arab parties will decide to accept and that one or two of the parties led by extremists may reject the proposals.5. As doubtless my colleagues are aware, the establishment of a Legislative Council has been strongly opposed by the Jews. While it is clear that the Jews will continue to co-operate generally with Government, I see no prospect of their reconsidering their decision not to co-operate in this particular matter, and I have recently received representations from influential Jews and others who support their cause to the effect that even now we should not proceed with the proposals for setting up a Council or that we should, at any rate to use their own phrase &quot; back-pedal.&quot; But, however little we may like the prospect of a Legislative Council in Palestine, which may well serve as a platform, for Arab grievances, I am convinced, as were my immediate predecessors, that the commit-ments of His Majesty&apos;s Government are such that it is now impossible to reconsider the matter. Nor is any further delay practicable. Sir Arthur Wauchope, who has proved so successful in the extremely difficult post of High Commissioner and whose term of-office has just been extended for a second period of five years from November 1936, would find his position impossible. With full authority from His Majesty&apos;s Government, he has given undertakings which he could not go back on. I fear that, if it were suggested that matters should now be held up, Sir Arthur Wauchope would feel compelled to resign, and I should regard that as a real disaster.6. If, of course, as the result of his discussions in Palestine it should emerge that the Arabs generally change their ground and indicate that they, like the Jews, though for other reasons, do not wish the proposal for a Legisla-tive Council to be pursued, the position would be different. In that event, as suggested at the end of the then Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum (CP. 374 (32) ) of the 3rd November, 1932, His Majesty&apos;s Government might find themselves in a position in which they had done their best to fulfil their pledge, but in which fulfilment was practically impossible, and that might discharge them for the time being from, their obligations and throw them back on continuing to govern the country as at present.
