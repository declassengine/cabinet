COPY NO. Q  &apos;/DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) . 25 (36).C A B I N E T.APPLICATION FOR REMOVAL OF ROGER CASEMENT&apos;S BODY Td&quot;&quot;ireland .Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary,1.      There has just &quot;been forwarded te the Home office an official communication from Mr. de Valera to the Dominions Secretary asking that the remains of Roger Casement (who was executed for treason on 3rd August,  1916,  and buried in pentonviTie Prison)  should be transferred to Ireland for the purpose of interment there.      The despatch states that there is a widespread desire in Ireland that this should be done and that this desire is shared by the Government of the Irish Free State.      Mr. de Valera intimated that he would like a prompt reply as he wished to make a statement  on the subject in the Dail on Wednesday next.      As this application has political implications and the treatment of it may affect Anglo-Irish relations, I feel that it should be brought before the Cabinet,2.      Various applications for permission to remove Casement&apos;s remains have been made by or on behalf of his relations both at the time of the execution and subsequently.      Among these was an application from his brother in 1924 when Mr. Arthur Henderson was Home Secretary.      In refusing these applications sometimes no reason has been given and sometimes the refusal has been based on the provisions of Section 6 of the Capital Punishment (Amendment) Act, 1868, which enacts that &quot;The body of every offender executed shall be buried within the walls of the prison in *Lioh judgment of death is executed on him&quot;. The Home Office has acted on the view that  these provisions apply to cases of treason as well as to cases of murder, and therefore required that the body of Casement must he buried
in the prison,  and that &quot;buried&quot; means permanently buried.3.      There have also been in recent years several private and unofficial approaches by the High Commissioner for the Irish T&apos;&apos;ree State both to myself and to my predecessors    I have never given any encouragement to the idea.      The present, however, is the first occasion on which the Free State Government has made any official move in the matter.4,      My own view is that the right course is to adhere to the refusal of permission, both on general and on particular grounds. On general grounds, the following considerations seem weighty;-(1)    The matter is essentially one for a uniform rule.      hither no bodies should be handed over,  or the relatives should be given the option in every case of removing the corpse of an executed criminal for private burial.      Any discrimination between one case and another would lead to difficulties.(2)    Unseemly incidents would inevitably occur in many cases.      The removal of the body and the subsequent funeral would often by the occasion of a public demonstra-tion of a very undesirable character.(3)    It would be quite impossible to secure secrecy for such a removal, even where the relatives were willing to give an undertaking that they would do all in their power to avoid publicity.      The arrangements necessary at the prison would undoubtedly become known at a very early stage.      Crowds would collect and scenes of disorder might in some cases be provoked.The latter part of this view does not appear to be founded on such solid grounds as the former but in fact I am informed that there is no case since the Act of 1868 of the remains of executed criminals having been removed from prison premises and having been interred elsewhere except on occasions when a prison has been discontinued and the site has been sold.      In such cases the remains are re-interred in another prison or in a public burial ground prescribed by the Secretary of State.      There is no present intention of disposing of pentonville prison.
5.      As for the particular case, I do not believe that the surrender of Casementrs remains to the Free State Government would in the end help to improve relations between this country and the Free State.      on the contrary, it would provoke criticism, and perhaps opposition,  in other quarters.      It might result in the exploiting of his memory as a hero and a martyr.      It seems to me much more likely to promote bitter feelings between the two countries than to promote appeasement. If things are left as they are, we are merely following the invariable rule in such matters.6a      As regards the form in wnich the refusal snould he communicated to the Free    State Government,  I should prefer merely to say that the request has been considered but that H.I\&apos;u Government in the United Kingdom are unable, to comply with it.      It is true that, as pointed out above, the refusal has in some cases in the -past been based on legal objections (the validity of which has been contested by those who applied) and that it is probable that the Free State Government may be aware of this, but it seems to me tnat the formula which I suggest covers the legal as well as the other aspects of the matter and. that it is preferable in a communication between Governments to put the matter in this form.(Intld.) J.S.ome Office.January 31st, 1936.
