A. 0.38,9.BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL. STATE OF TRADE - NOVEMBER, 1935.Summary of reports submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (Supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS. TRADE.      Imports in November at  71.5 m. were  6.8 m. more than in November last year.      Nearly three-quarters of the increase was due to an increase in food and raw materials. Of the increase of  1.7 m.  in manufactured goods over  700,000 was in respect of non-ferrous metals and over  200,000 related to machinery.Exports of United Kingdom&apos; produce at  39.4 m. were  3.3 m. more than in November last year.Re-exports amounted to  4.6 m., an increase of  560,000 over November, 1934.EMPLOYMENT.      The total number of unemployed persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges at 25th November was 1,918,562, an increase of 2,172 as compared with 21st October.The main variations were:-London.............. * 12,369South Eastern....... + 9,755South Western....... + 6,029Midlands............ - 857North Eastern....... - 15,471North Western....... - 7,818Scotland............ * 2,264Wales............... - 4,099The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 in employment at 25th November was 10,537,000.      This was 45,000 more than a month earlier and 315,000 more than a year ago.A further improvement in employment was recorded in coal-mining, the cotton industry, iron and steel manufacture, engineer-ing, the shipbuilding and ship-repairing industries and dock and harbour services.      On the other hand there was a further decline in the&apos; building and contracting trades, the shipping service and hotel services;    there was also some decline in the
tailoring, dressmaking, hat and cap, pottery, the motor vehicle, cycle? etc., and electrical apparatus industries.RAILWAY TjRAFFIC.      During the five weeks ended the 1st December railway traffic receipts increased &quot;by  317,000 (2B28%) compared with the corresponding period of 1934.      The increase amounted to .36% in passenger traffic, to 1.67$ in the case of merchandise, minerals and live stock and 6,4$ in the case of coal/ coke, etc.      The total receipts for the forty-eight weeks ended 1st December amounted to  139.25m. as against  137.98 m.  for the same period of 1934.SHIPPING-.      The Chamber of Shipping index number for freights (1913 s 100) was 89.74 in November as against 93.97 in October and 83.68 in November 1934.      There has been an improvement in the volume of trade since the beginning of the autumn.BANKING.     Money was easy throughout November, owing partly to the banks being heavy buyers of bills and (to an increasing extent) to French funds seeking employment in the London short loan market.      The Treasury bill rate fell from lls0ld.  at the &apos; beginning of the month to I0s.l0d.  on the 8th, but rose on the 29th to llsj9d.The dollar was steady around 4.92 throughout the month.There was nervousness about the franc;    for the first three weeks the spot rate was fairly steady around 74^- - 74f but it later weakened to about 75.      The three months&apos; forward franc weakened from l  - If to over 3 francs discount on 25th November but rallied by the end of the month to 2^.      The French Bank Rate was raised from 3% to 6%.In sympathy with the Chinese dollar, the Hongkong dollar fell from Slid,  to 17^d.Gold prices (between 141s.7d. and 140s.lid. an oz.) have been above the gold exchange parities.Silver, during the greater part of the month was steadyaround 295, ^ 16
COALo    The average weekly output during the 13 weeks ended 23rd November was 4,488,000 tons as compared with 4,437,000 tons in the corresponding period of 1934 - an increase of 1%;      and the average number of wage-earners employed was 747,700, a decrease of 2%eExports in November amounted to 305 m0 tons as compared with 3o32 m0 tons last year,, A heavy fall in exports to Italy (350,000 tons) and smaller decreases in exports to Spain, Canada, Belgium and the TJ0S0Ao were outweighed by increases to most of the other markets, including Egypt, the Irish Free State, Germany, Denmark, France and BraziloIRON AND STEEL,    The high level of activity in the industry continued generally and the output of some works is sold a considerable time ahead0    Public works schemes recently announced will probably lead to a further increase in productionAfter a slight reaction following the increase in prices early in the month, demand for pig-iron has been resumed0 The semi-finished steel section is, generally speaking, producing at full capacity and a number of works have declined further business,.    The finished steel section is extremely active and the recently announced shipbuilding and railway orders should provide business for some months to come; export business is slowly improving,,Scotland,,    The situation continues very satisfactory and nearly all works expect to be fully occupied during the first quarter of 1936o    Makers of joists and sections find difficulty in meeting demand0    Schemes for plant extension for the production of semi-finished material are proposed9-North East Coasto      Local steelworks are extremely &quot;busy and pig-iron producers are better placed than at any period since the War.    The output of many semi-finished
steel producers is heavily sold aheadc    Structural engineers have heen somewhat hampered &quot;by late delivery of materials makers of joists and sections being particularly busy0 The sheet market has improved both at home and abroadoSheffield,    All branches of the steel trade are extremely active, many departments being busier than ever before0    The demand for open-hearth steel is particularly strong and some makers have refused business0South Wales.,    Business is steadily expanding.   The tin-plate industry is reported to be working at little more than 55fo of capacity? but there is a good demand for semis0    Demand from structural engineers and shipbuilders is strongoENGINEERINGo    Progress was maintained in most directions and the   general condition of order books is probably the best since pre-depression daysoExports of machinery in November were valued at  304mo as against  3clm0 a year ago.MOTOR INDUSTRY-    The number of motor vehicles newly registered in October, 1935, was 30,156 or 4,623 more than in October, 1934;    there was an increase of 4,710 in private cars but a decline of 87 in other vehicles,.The production of private cars and taxis for the year ended the 30th September was 311,544 as against 256,866 for the previous years    The production of commercial vehicles for the year was 92,176 as against 85,633 for the previous year.During the ten months ended the 30th November exports of private cars and chassis amounted to 49,716 and commercial vehicles and chassis to 12,379 showing increases respectively of 23e$2 and 4D7^ when compared with the corresponding period of 1934o    Imports of complete private cars and taxis during November amounted to 756 -units or ,75 more than in November,19340LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIESg   A remarkable recovery has recently occurred in nearly all trades using non-ferrous metals and most
factories are working to capacity.      In the cutlery, silver and electro-plate; trades,  the seasonal demand has been much heavier than last year and in certain sections there is a shortage of skilled labour.      November was an exceptionally good month for engineers&apos;  and mechanics&apos;  tools.      The foundry trade is fully employed and the presswork and enamelled hollow-ware trades are busy.      Conditions are satisfactory in the metal smallwares, needle, and lock and allied trades.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.      The increased activity in the industry during the previous months of the year was maintained in November and the prospects appear to be good.In the heavy engineering trades, business remained steady.Consumption of electricity in November amounted to 1,758 m. units,  an increase of 10.2% over November 1934. The aggregate increase for the first eleven months of 1935, when compared with 1934,  amounted to 12.4%.COTTON. The improvement continued and extended to all sections of the industry. Average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to mills at 30.6 m. lbs., compared with 25.0 m. lbs. a year ago, were the highest since January,  1930;    takings of-American and Egyptian were increased, of Indian unaltered and of other growths reduced.The rise in prices of raw cotton (particularly Egyptian) and yarns continued.      Firms representing 84% of the ring spinning section have expressed willingness to adhere to a minimum price scheme for yarn, but the scheme cannot become effective until 90% have agreed.Yarn exports at 12.4 m. lbs. were slightly less than in October but 1.8 rn. lbs. more than in November,  1934;    the decline as against October was confined to unbleached yarns. Exports of piece-goods at 158.5 m.  sq. yds. were rather less
than in October (though average daily exports were higher) and 13.9 m.  sq. yds.  less than in November,  1934.      India took 3.1 m.  sq. yds.  less than in October;    Australia,  South Africa, Ceylon,  Canada and Denmark also took less, but there were increased exports to other markets,  including British West Africa, New Zealand, British West Indies, Egypt and French West and Equatorial Africa.SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.      There has been a considerable slackening in demand for weaving yarns. Manufacturers have been throwing large quantities of piece goods on to the market at low prices.      These unsatisfactory conditions are attributed to uncertainty as to the removal of the Excise duty.The hosiery trade has been moderately good and the underwear trade was very busy on cotton and wool yarns;    the warp knitting trade was,  however,   quiet.The silk spinning industry is fairly well.occupied with yarns for the hosiery trade.The price of raw silk in most markets fluctuated considerably during November,  the tendency being towards lower quotations.CHEMICALS.      Sales of alkali in the home market were exceedingly good and export deliveries were very satisfactory. The trade in chlorine products and most of the industrial nitrogen products remained good.      Home sales of dyestuffs for the 11 months ended 30th November showed an increase and foreign sales a decrease as compared with the corresponding period last year.      Sulphate of ammonia sales in the home market for 1935/36 are at present lower than last year, but many merchants have not yet bought their Spring requirements; sales to Empire markets for 1935/36 show an increase but&apos; there is a&apos;decline in total sales to foreign markets.
The demand for most coal tar products was active and there was some improvement in the trade in wood distillation products, while fairly substantial business was transacted in pharmaceutical products.PAPER.     An increased demand, seasonal in character, was experienced in almost all branches of the trade and the total rate of production of United Kingdom mills in November was probably larger than ever before.Exports of paper and board in November showed an increase of about 12% over November,  1934, due mainly to larger newsprint shipments to Australia.POTTERY.      All sections of the industry were fairly busy in October.     Demand for general earthernware continued good on the whole.      There was a seasonal slackening in orders for china ware.      Trade in sanitary ware of fireclay remained very satisfactory.RETAIL TRADE.      The money value of retail sales in October was 7.4% greater than in October, 1934.      All areas shared in this improvement.      Sales of food and perishables continued to expand, the increase for October being 10.2% as compared with a rise of 6.7% for February to September. Sales of other merchandise increased by 4.7% as against 3.9% for February to September.      There was a decrease of 2.2% in piece goods as compared with October, 1934.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE.      The sales of the Go-operative Wholesale Society for the 4 weeks ended 9th November were 7.9% more than sales a year ago.The weighted average of the wholesale prices of seven of the principal commodities for the 12 months ended November 1935 was 7.92% higher, and of the retail prices of those commodities was 3.87% higher, than a year earlier.
CANADIAN TRADE.      A general improvement in economic conditions occurred during October.      The index of the physical volume of business rose to 107.2 from the September figure of 101.9.     Exports of copper and zinc increased as compared with September, but nickel exports declined.      Imports of Bauxite (for aluminium manufacture) increased.The index of manufacturing activity rose from 100 to 105.4. The manufacture of foodstuffs continued to increase.      The month&apos;s newsprint production was a record;    exports of planks and boards also expanded,  though exports of wood pulp declined. A sharp increase was shown in automobile production.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.        1,715,327 bales of wool were received into store from the 1st July to the 31st October,  as compared with 1,659,919 a year ago, while 722,135 bales were sold or shipped as against 467,360 last year.      Wheat and flour shipments from the 1st December 1934 to the 27th November were equivalent to 102.54 m. bushels of wheat against 92.94 m. bushels a year ago.      Butter exports from the 1st July to the 23rd November amounted to 32,551 tons as compared with 36,860 tons a year ago.      Imports of merchandise during October were valued at  9.49 m.  (Australian currency)  compared with  8.04 m. in October, 1934.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.      Conditions remain active and satisfactory in the urban areas and. there are some indications of greater rural activity.      Imports in September were  350,000more than in September, 1934.      Exports (excluding bullion andspecie) were  250,000 less, decreases in diamonds and maizeexceeding increases in wool, hides and skins and other mer-chandise.      Gold mining continues unchecked.      Rains have brought some relief on farms, although some losses of stockhave been reported.      An increase of 16^% in wheat production over last season is anticipated.      Wool prices tend to improve,Activity in manufacturing industries is maintained;    the demandfor cement has increased enormously.-8-
1*2SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.Argentina.      Good rains continued during November but crops will be below the average.      Though grain markets have been inactive,  the last fortnight of &quot;November saw a moderate rise in prices.  .   The cattle market has been firm. Arrivals of wool are increasing in volume and there is a good demand for all classes.Total exports in October were larger than a year ago; for the first ten months of 1935 they were 7.57% higher than in the corresponding period of 1934,  and they exceeded imports by nearly $318 million.      Exports of meat continued to decline in volume though a rise in prices maintained the value above that for January-October,  1934.The rates at which exchange permits are negotiated are now to be fixed daily by the Central Bank;    the Government state that the Exchange Profits Fund is now large enough to regulate the market and prevent sharp fluctuations and that the new system marks an important step towards a free market.Brazil.    Coffee -    Prices have declined somewhat.      A shortage of labour may seriously affect coming crops. Exports continue at a higher level than last year.Coffee now represents only about 50% of Brazil&apos;s total exports.      In the first 8 months of this year,  cotton represented 18% of total exports (as against less than 1% two years ago)  and exports of wool,  rice,  sugar,  timber and wax have also increased.A proposed new law for regulating foreign trade states that the existing exchange regulations shall remain in force so long as the international economic position remains abnormal.It appears that definite progress is being made in liquidating foreign claims,  that an actual shortage of
exchange need, not &quot;be expected and that no delay is being experienced in obtaining cover for goods delivered after 11th February, 1955.Chile.      Produce markets in the first half of November were inactive, though there has been some demand for wool. The average monthly copper production in the latter -part of this year is less than last year&apos;s in accordance with the international agreement.      Total exports and imports for the first nine months of 1935 showed increases respectively of some 3% and 55% as compared with the corresponding period of 1934.Peru.      General conditio?as are reported, to be improving. Cotton prices have been firm and by October 85% of the 1934/35 crop had been sold.      Imports in the first eight months of this year were about 11% more and exports 1% less than in January/August,  1934.Colombia.      There was general uncertainty owing to legislative proposals.      Coffee prices have declined and no immediate improvement is expected.      Coffee exports in September were nearly 100% above those for September 1934. Total exports for the first eight months this year were about 4% less, but imports some 40% greater,  than in January/August, 1934.Uruguay.      The gold reserves of the Central Bank are to be revalued on the basis of the official exchange rates ruling during the past twelve months and a new note issue made.      This scheme will in effect devalue the currency by 45%.
