This report, of which a summary is attached, is, unlike its predecessor, confined almost entirely to a description of the actual work of the Commissioners.In reply to questi ons by Mr. Shinwe.ll and Mr. Whiteley in the House on Thursday last I promised that the report should be published this week and it is proposed to have copies available for Members on Thursday evening.(Intd.)   E. B.10th February, 1936,
SUI&amp;S&amp;BX   OF , HIE   SECOND   REPORT   OF   THE   COMMISSIONER   FOR SPECIAL   AREAS   (ENG-IAKD   AMD   WALES).&apos; Part z&apos; INTRODUCTION..The Commissioner^ duty is &quot;to facilitate the economic and social development&quot; of the Special Areas and this implies mainly a long term policy. Steady progress has been made but the Act does not provide for schemes primarily intended to give immediate employment and spectacular results must not be expected.   Existing agencies have been used where possible but in some cases special organisations have been created e.g. North Eastern Housing Association,   Welsh Land Settlement Society and the North East Trading Estates Company.     Close touch has been maintained with Government Depart-ments which have freely given advice and practical help.Part II. INDUSTRY..The apathy displayed by industrialists in the establishment of new industries is deplored,Ebbw Vale.     Reference is made to the large part played by the Commissioner in the reopening of the steel works at Ebbw Vale,Jarrow, The efforts of Sir J. Jarvis have been largely responsible forthe improved position.Industrial Development Councils have been assisted financially.The Travel and Industrial Development Association has been supported.Trading; Estates.Preliminary arrangements for forming the North East Trading Estates Company are well advanced.    This company, not trading for profit, will be put In a position to lease factories equipped with all facilities    (roads, railway sidings, powerj quays, etc) at fair rents which will not carry any direct subsidy.Private enterprise may be able to establish similar facilities in South Wales and no competitive steps will he taken by the Commissioner in that area pending developments.
Finance for Wow Enterprises*   Assistance cannot be given under the Act from the Special Areas fund and the previous recommendation for the creation of a Special Fund for the purpose is repeated.Govermejrb^fact] .n2.    Preference, other things being equal, for the Special Areas is given under the Treasury Agreements with the London Passenger Transport Board and the Railway Companies.     Ihe contract placing Departments p-ive a similar preference to the scheduled deTjressed areas in which the Special Areas are included.Public Works, of Industrial Utility to which assistance has been or will be given subject to satisfactory outcome of negotiations(a) A Deep Water Quay on the River Tyne, and measures for improving the navigation of the river.(b) Sunderland Pish Quay.(c) Wliitehaven Harbour.(d) Maryport Harbour.(e) River Severn Bridge (formally recommended to the Minister of Transport).Clearance of Sites.   Assistance given or promised in several cases. Pit Drainage. -   No satisfactory solution of the problem in South Wales has been found.   The position in S. W. Durham is still being examined* General Industrial Situation^Statistics are given to show the improbability of reabsorbing all the unemployed, owing in part to technical improvements and mechanisation of the staple industries of the Special Areas,Transference.      The policy of transference should accordingly be pressed/ Vi: I&quot;-;1; i&apos; ill:! U &apos; .   &apos; &apos;    &apos; &apos;  &apos;  :; &apos;forward despite objections (South Wales in particular).Part III.HEALTH.Absence of adequate Health and Sanitary Services hinder industrial development, but owing to heavy burdens on Local Authorities these Services have in some cases fallen to a low standard.Assistance is therefore being given to Hospitals, Maternity and Child Welfare Centres,    Open Air Nurseries,    District Nursing.    The Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem,    the National Birthday Trust Fund, and Courses in Cookery and Dietetics are also being assisted.
IIi I9iiPhysical CultureAssistance has been given or promised through theNational Council of Social Service and for classes to he organised &quot;by the Ministry of Labour.Baths.     Assistance given or promised.Water supplies have been assisted in Urban Areas and several Sewerage schemes have been assisted in whole or part.North Eastern Housing Association Limited,  (registered in December, 1935) will be prepared to erect houses to assist Local Authorities to proceed with slum clearance.    The usual Exchequer subsidy in such cases will accrue to the Company and with assistance from the Special Areas Fund the houses will be lot at rents which the tenants from slum areas can afford to pay.     Rate relief vd.ll thereby be afforded to the Local Authorities. Durham Aged Miners&apos; Homes Association.Assistance at the rate of  80 a house promised.party/^ A&amp;RICULTUEE...In consequence of a deliberately cautious policy of land settlement only experiments on a comparatively small scale have been assisted. (x)    Land Settlement Association.Assistance is being given to:-(a) 26 Transference Schemes of approximately 40 families each;(b) a number of schemes within the Special Areas of Northumberland and Cumberland;(c) On an estate of potton of 550 acres,    30 market garden holdings of 5 acres each have been established.   This involves provision of housing and training before the families are established;(d) An estate of 500 acres at Andover is being similarly developed and120 to 800 acres at Pen Drayton,    Spalding, Howdon, Aidleigh (2), G-rantham, Cadoby Hall, Sidle sham, Koynor. Local advisory committees have been set up to assist the settlers, particularly in the early stages.Sanitary.Services.Part IV.HOUSING-.as an experiment the transferees are to build their own houses;(e) The Association has also acquired nine other estates varying from
In Durham, Northumberland and Cumberland assistance has been given towards settlement schemes organised by the County Councils. (5)   Wales - Yfelsh Land Settlement Society...The Welsh Land Settlement Society Limited is about to be formally registered (the Council of management includes the st, lion. D. Lloyd George, O.H. t M.P.&apos;)   Preliminary arrangements have been made including the acquisition of an estate at Bovcrton, Llantwit Major.   The activities of the Society vd.ll cover both the settlement of families on small holdings and the organisation of a Cooperative Farm on intensive lines similar to the successful Fords on experiment at Borehaiii, Essex. ()   Group Holdings.Groups of holdings of   \ to -g- acre have been organised in South Wales, Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland and Ivlonmouth to afford training,    scope for older men who are not likely to be selected for full-time holdings, and provision of assistance in cases of underemployment. (5)   Allotments have boon assisted throughout the Special Areas. (6)   Land Drainage.   The possibility of assisting land drainage in areas not covered by catchment boards is under examination.(7)   Afforestation.   A formal recommendation was made to the Forestry Commission in December, 1935, that without prejudice to their normal operations, they should plant some 200,000 acres in or within 15 miles of the Special Areas.    This involves a programme of  4,000,000 to  5,000,000 over a period of 10 years.(8)   Welsh National Park..   The establishment of a Welsh National Park is recommended but there is no suitable land within the Welsh Special Area and there is doubt whether assistance by the Commissioner is possible under the Act.Part VI.PROBLEM OF UUBPLOIED YOUNG- PERSONS IN THE SPECIAL AREAS. The Commissioner is impressed by the tendency to demoralisation.     He recommends increased training and instruction coupled with a reasonable assurance of employment particularly in the case of those who attend the Instructional Centres of the Ministry of Labour,     To moot the position the Commissioner recommends the specific provision of national works.
Intermediate non-residontial centres are recommended as a preliminary to training at Government Training Centres.The failure of certain Local Authorities to carry out their obligations to establish Junior Instruction Centres (Cumberland and Monmouthshire in particular) is noted.Assistance from the Special Areas Fund for medical assistance is recommended for juveniles between the time they cease to have the benefit of school medical attention and become eligible for assistance under National Health Insurance.   Many juveniles in this group cannot take advantage of training, etc, owing to remediable defects (teeth, ej^esight, etc.)Part VII.VOLUNTARY (LOCAL AMENITIES) SCHSfES.    - (Sports fields, Recreation gro\uids and Parks). These schemes are deliberately left to local stimulus of voluntary effort and assistance is confined to rendering, technical advice and providing tools, working clothes and a midday meal.Fart VIII. OTHER TREASURES OF SOCIAL L.ErSOVEI,iBNT. Assistance has been given to the National Council of Social Service with a view to accelerating the provision of Social and Occupational Centres for men, women, and juveniles.Grants have boon made to assist the establishment of Social Settlements.Part IX. MISCELLANEOUS.Su^sistonco Production Schomesi for the supply of dairy produce, vegetables, etc., and co-operative organisation by workshops for bootmaking, tailoring, baking, etc., have been assisted,     production is for consumption and exchange within the cormunity and to raise the standard of living.Youth Hostels Association.     The possibility of assisting the establishment of further hostels in the Special Areas is being explored,Summer Camps for Military Training.     The War Office has been asked to extend the experiment adopted.in 1935 of holding camps in the Special Areas. ^Adoption&quot;-     Co-operation has been effected with the County of Surrey adoption scheme by giving or promising assistance in certain cases in Jarrow,
3    9The County of Hortfor&amp;shire is developing a scheme with a more rural aspect.The Bedford Rotary Club have &quot;adopted&quot; a village in Durham.A Surrey parish has organised a scheme to employ a number of men from the distressed areas on odd jobs for the benefit of subscribers to the scheme, pending their absorption in the normal industrial life of the district.part X,S01IL1ART OP SXPEKDITURE AND COIflgTLIBNTS.

SECOND REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER ? 7 ^ FOR THE SPECIAL AREAS(england and wales) PART IINTRODUCTION1: On the 4th July list I submitted my First Report, which was presented to Parliament and published on the 17th July as Com-mand Paper 4957. The Report included a General Review and Conclusions, in which a. number of recommendations were made. The Report now submitted gives particulars of the progress made during the six months ending the 31st December. In addition the whole of the year 1935 is dealt with, repetition being avoided so far as is possible.2. During the past six months the general principles determined at the outset and explained in the First Report have been-observed. It has been found possible to adopt a number of additional measures designed, in. the words of the Special Areas Act, &quot;to facilitate the economic development and social improvement &quot;of the Special Areas. These words, especially &quot; economic develop-ment,&quot; imply a long-term policy. Whilst many schemes, some of considerable importance, have been sanctioned, it must be realised that the benefits arising from their execution will accrue cumula-tively and that it will take time before these can be fully1 secured. With the help of the measures; taken and.a continuance of pros-prosperous conditions generally, a steady improvement in the- Special Areas may be looked for, but- spectacular results must not&apos; be expected. In view of evidence of misunderstanding as to the nature of.the. work and measures which cain be undertaken in conformity with the Act, it is desirable again to point! out thati the&apos; Special Areas Act does not make provision for expenditure on schemes primarily intended to1;give immediate employment: Naturally I am anxious that the works I initiate should provide as much employment-as possible, consistent with their efficient execution, but the artificial creation of employment has not been attempted; it produces no adequate or sufficiently lasting benefits. For these reasons it would be wrong to judge. the value of my work solely or even mainly by the amount of employment given.3. I have continued to operate generally through existing autho-rities, organisations and agencies rather than directly to carry-out work myself. Some of these, particularly Local Authorities and the National Council of Social Service, which was already in existence when I was appointed, -had acquired long and valuable experience of the type of work it was sought to prosecute. The policy&apos; adopted has been, justified; the work cam be started more 31182 A i
quickly, overlapping of authority is avoided, the cost of admitiia-tration reduced and future maintenance assured. Where I found no existing agency suitable for my purpose and was anxious to embark on work or measures which could be carried on after my appointment came to an end, I determined to create and finance special organisations for the particular purposes contemplated. The most notable of these are the North Eastern Housing Associa-tion, the Welsh Land Settlement Society and the North East Trading Estates Company. The only major exception to this general rule of operating through existing agencies has been in respect of the guidance and supervision of (Voluntary (Lfocal Amenities) Schemes, of which a full description is given in Part VII. Here the initiative is not taken toy me or my officers, but by local bodies of unemployed men, there being usually no appropriate organisation in a position to undertake the work of guidance and supervision. These schemes have met with success and increased in number considerably during the last six months. I have had to appoint additional technical staff, attached to the offices of the District Commissioners, to give such help and technical advice as are needed.4. Apart from these additional appointments I have not found it necessary to add to my staff. This has been kept at the mini-mum number compatible with efficiency, and the cost to the Special Areas Fund of my total administrative expenses up to the end o! the year amounted to about  25,000, or just over one-half of one per cent, of the cost of the schemes investigated and towards which grants have been offered.5. I have continued to maintain the closest touch with all Government Departments concerned, and it is a pleasure again to express my thanks for the valuable assistance so willingly given, It is impossible to give a, full account of the help afforded in many directions, but special mention should be made of the constant advice and practical help received from the Ministries of Labour, Health, Agriculture and Transport, from the Unemployment Assistance Board and from the Chief Valuer&apos;s Department. All these have put their services freely at my disposal and thus enabled the various problems, in which their respective Departments have experience, to be dealt with more expeditiously and economically than would otherwise have been the case.6. The Report which follows is divided for convenience into a number of Parts dealing with the various sections of my work, which should be considered as a whole if its effectiveness is to be assessed. I have consistently held the view that the problem of the Special Areas must be attacked on a wide front by a com-bination of different methods. There is no single simple solu-tion. The Report shows that many and diverse measures are being applied, and that the benefits accruing from the passing o! the Special Areas Act are being felt in a variety of directions bj
a large number of communities in the Special Areas. It is im-possible to give a complete account of all the activities initiated, but an endeavour has been made in this Report to present a fairly comprehensive picture of the work so far accomplished.PART IIINDUSTRYIndustrial Position7. Statistics relating to the variations in the unemployment situation in the Special Areas from June to December, 1935, will be found in Appendices I and II. From these tables it will be seen that the number of registered unemployed, though it increased slightly during the summer months, was in December last some-what lower than it was either in June, 1935, or in December, 1934. The figures for the three dates were : December, 1934, 343,992; June, 1935, 332,079; December, 1935, 317,574. The number of registered unemployed expressed as a percentage of the total in-sured persons in the Areas was 35 -0 in December, 1934; 34-2i in June, 1935; and 32-7 in December, 1935.8. In Appendix II the figures of unemployment for the North East Special Area have been subdivided into the three main in-dustrial sections of the Area, and in Appendix I separate figures are given for Tyneside and for the remainder of the Area. The period is too short to. enable reliable deductions to be drawn as to the prospects of each section of the area, but it will be seen from Appendix II, in which figures for December, 1934, are included, that during the twelve months between then and December, 1935, the numbers wholly unemployed in the North Bast Special Area showed improvement except in South West Durham. In West Cumberland the figures were more or less stationary until November, 1935, when they rose by some two thousand owing to the closing of collieries at Whitehaven. In South Wales there was little change during the year but such changes as took place were in the right direction.Establishment of New IndustriesBoard of Trade Survey9. Since the publication of my First Report the Board of Trade have published their Survey of Industrial Development for 1934. The results as finally published are even more disappointing than was indicated in the provisional figures contained in paragraph 17 of my First Report. Only seven new factories were opened, and two existing ones extended in the Special Areas during that year, out of a total of 478 new factories and 144 extensions for the whole Country.   The Survey, while it contains some information on the
question-, does not,give any-decisive indication of. the. reasons; which prevented the Special Areas from, getting a fair share of the new factories.Circular Letter to Manufacturers10. The circular letter referred to in paragraph 28 of my First Report, which was issued, with the -assistance of the Federation of British Industries, to firms outside the Special Areas, invited them to complete and return .a -questionnaire on the possibility of their establishing a new industry or a branch of their business in one of the Special Areas. The questions to which replies were sought were.as follows : (1) Have you established any works or branches of your business in any of the Special Areas during the past few years ?(2) Have you considered within the past five years the choice of a site in one of the Special Areas? If the answer to the above is &apos;&apos; yes &apos;&apos;, would you say whether you have been deterred by:-      &quot; &quot;(a) High rates;(b) Fear of labour trouble ;(c) Inaccessibility;(d) Technical trade reasons ;(e) Other reasons (if possible please indicate nature).(3) Are you now prepared to consider choice of a site.in.,one of the Special Areas for a new works or any extension of your business?If the - answer to this is &apos;&apos; yes &apos;&apos;, would you say. whether you would prefer a site in :  (ft) County Durham;(b) Tyneside;(c) South&apos; Wales ; or(d) West Cumberland.A map accompanied each questionnaire, showing the districts covered, by the Special Areas, and at the suggestion of theFedera-tion a short article was inserted in their Journal,-explaining,the objects I had in view in circulating the questionnaire. The com-pletion and return of the questionnaire entailed no expense and in-volved the minimum of labour.11. The list of firms to whom the circulation was made was com-piled partly from a schedule supplied direct by the Federation of British Industries. and partly from lists -supplied by Associations affiliated to the. Federation. 69 affiliated Associations were approached, but only 35 supplied addresses. Nine of the others re-plied that no useful purpose .would be served by. circularising their members, while&apos;25, or roughly - one-third of the total number of Associations, did - not reply.
12. The full results of the circulation of the letter were not available when my First Report was compiled, but they have now been examined, and I regret to say with disappointing results.13. A total of 5,829 copies of the questionnaire were circulated with the following result : (1) 4,066 firms did not reply;(2) 1,313 gave unqualified negative replies to all questions;(3) 386 gave qualified negatives to all questions;(4) 64 answered at least one question in the affirmative.While I acknowledge gratefully the courtesy of those firms who returned the questionnaire and in some instances accompanied their reply with a sympathetic and helpful letter, I regret the lack of interest in the Special Areas shown by the large majority who made no response.14. Of the 1,763 who replied, only 38 stated that they had established new works or branches in the Special Areas in the last few years, while 35 stated that they had actually considered within the last five years the choice of a site in one of the (Special Areas but had decided against it. Of the latter number, 12 gave no reason for their adverse decisions. Of those who gave reasons, 14 indicated &apos;&apos; technical trade reasons &apos;&apos;; seven indicated inaccessibility; three fear of labour troubles; three lack of capital; 2. shortage of work and 2 high rates.15. The third question inquired if firms were now prepared to consider the choice of a site in one of the Special Areas, and here 12 replied in the affirmative, while 1,751 gave negative replies. Of the 12, four stated that they would prefer South Wales, two County Durham, two Tyneside and one West Cumberland, while the others did not specify any area.16. Of the 386 who gave negative replies to all three questions but qualified them in various ways, 144 gave &quot; technical trade reasons &quot; as then explanation, 80 stated that they had ample scope in their present works, 47 pointed out that there was depression and distress in their own area, 33 referred to the inaccessibility of the Special Areas, and 25 said that they were not yet in a position to consider expansion. A smaller number of this group gave &quot;other reasons&quot;, e.g., seven stated that they were distributors only, six said that they had closed down or were doing so shortly, six stated that they already had branches in the Special Areas, six mentioned fear of labour trouble, five referred to high costs, four to high rates, two had already opened factories elsewhere.In addition seven firms stated that they had in their present employ labour transferred from Special Areas.In two cases shortage of skilled labour was stressed. This matter has been referred to the Ministry of Labour.
17. The major points which the questionnaire has brought out are:        ,(1) The lack of interest in the Special Areas shown by industry in general as evidenced by the large number of firms who did not reply and of the Associations which did not supply lists of their members;(2) The smallness of the number who had during the last few-years set up works of any kind in the Special Areas ;(3) The even smaller number now ready to consider opening up a factory or branch;(4) The diverse nature of the reasons given for neglecting the Special Areas.From the first, second and third points, it must be assumed that there is little prospect of the Special Areas being assisted by the spontaneous action of industrialists now located outside the areas. The fourth point, however, is less disheartening. The analysis of the replies shows no single well defined and insurmountable obstacle standing in the way, but rather a variety of vaguely defined and probably vaguely felt prejudices, which may be overcome if the right means to combat them can be discovered. The results of the enquiry, if disappointing, have helped to confirm the feeling generally prevalent that industrialists, in the main, are indifferent to the Special Areas. This strengthens the call for measures to make them more attractive and their economic advantages better known. Once more I tender my thanks to the Federation of British Industries for their assistance.Signs of Improvement18. As a relief to these somewhat discouraging indications there have been some encouraging features during the past year. Per-haps the most satisfactory of these was, the decision reached in November by Richard Thomas and Company to take over, re-construct and re-open the Ebbw Vale Steel Works.Ebbw Vale19. In December, before my appointment was confirmed, I made a visit to South Wales for the special purpose of investigating the problem of the Ebbw Vale Steel Works. The reason for this was my inability to visualise any other project in this area which offered so much relief on such a satisfactory basis as the recon-struction and re-opening of these works. I met Sir John Beynon, Chairman and Managing Director of the Ebbw Vale Steel Iron and Coal Company, Ltd., and his Board, who placed all informa-tion at my disposal, and rendered every assistance, as likewise did the officials of Barclays Bank, who continued to support the Com-pany despite the heavy trading losses being made. I also met the Trade Union representatives and learned their views on the situation.
138120. I felt at home with this investigation because throughout my business life I have often had to determine the economic value of sites for various industrial purposes.21. The problem was approached with an open mind but with full consciousness of repeated advice that it was impossible to salvage Ebbw Vale. Indeed, I had been warned of the futility of making the effort. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this preliminary investigation left me definitely of the opinion that the economic factors relating to these works warranted a determined effort to secure their re-opening if reconstruction could be effected.22. I realised that the Ebbw Vale Works could not rank with the few ideally situated steel works of maximum efficiency, but I felt their economic advantages were sufficient to warrant a sound claim to a place in an industry with widely distributed works of varying efficiency. Few, if any, industries are wholly comprised of units with 100 per cent, efficiency. It must be admitted the Ebbw Vale record was bad, but the causes of failure needed analysing; one had to differentiate between the impersonal and the personal factors. How far was failure due to lack of sound economic con-ditions inherent in the location of the works, and how far, if at all, to faulty judgment as to policy and layout or to inefficient manage-ment? Circumstances are not always to blame; one man succeeds where another fails. Anyhow it became painfully clear that the past misfortunes of the Ebbw Vale Works were prejudicing then-present possibilities.23-. Although I felt confident that there was a good case for the reconstruction of the Ebbw Vale Works, I did not expect anyone to accept my unsupported opinion as to their prospects. There-fore, in January of last year, I commissioned Mr. Brassert, who is recognised as a leading steel works expert, to make a report for me personally, so that I should be free to use it in any direction which I considered would help the re-opening of these works. Mr. Brassert&apos;s report not only endorsed the opinion formed by me as to the economic possibilities of the works, but it advocated their reconstruction on lines suitable for the manufacture of finished sheets by the American cold rolling process, a scheme Sir John Beynon favoured and had been working, on. It had the obvious advantage that by manufacturing a finished product the works would be self-contained and throw no steel ingots on the open market. Further, the Company was already, by the hot rolling process, successfully producing sheets which it was supplying to important firms in the motor industry for the manufacture of steel motor bodies. The quality produced was excellent and a goodwill had been built up for this Ebbw Vale product. This department of the Company and the large power station, which supplies the town of Ebbw Vale as well as the collieries and sheet mill, both made profits, but these were swallowed up in the considerable
losses arising from the operation of a group of collieries giving em-ployment to close on ten thousand men.24. Here was a scheme of reconstruction which had the support of the highest technical authority and at the same time wasaecept-able to the Chairman and Board of the Bbbw Vale Steel Company, but there remained the difficult task of finding the necessary finance. I! go into personal touch with several financiers of the very- highest standing, in the City. They showed not only willingness to help me, but a definite desire to do something to relieve distress in South Wales. Thus the atmosphere was good and sympathy was forth-coming, and, as my case for Ebbw Vale became better appreciated, I was, through a helpful source, encouraged to believe finance might be found if I could obtain the support of Sir Andrew Duncan, the Chairman of the British Iron and Steel Federation, for a scheme of reconstruction.   His sympathy and support were forthcoming.25. These negotiations took a considerable time. Meanwhile, the prospects of success looked brighter. Evidence has been forth-coming that more than one influential steelmaker realised that success would mean having to meet additional competition and that perhaps after all to secure control might be a better policy than to risk competition. Thus the possibility of the Ebbw Vale Works once more becoming a force in the Industry was steadily gaining ground. Benevolent complacency was giving way to practical in-terest. Further, there were powerful influences, growingly felt, which were favourably affecting the: position. These must not be overlooked. I refer to the effect of tariffs and of the International Steel Agreement. These factors made possible a substantial.in-crease in the production of domestic steel and thus changed for the better the prospects of the Industry; in many instances losses have been turned into profits.26. At this stage an unexpected development took place, which immediately improved the prospects for the Ebbw Vale Works. Sir William Firth, the Chairman of Richard Thomas and Company, who in July last had advised his shareholders at their Annual General Meeting that his Board proposed to erect a new strip mill at their works in North Lincolnshire, with the possible result that some more of their Welsh plant might have to be closed down, resolved instead to investigate the acquisition of the Ebbw Vale Works and the concentration of production there. He got into touch with me at the beginning of September, and I placed at his disposal all the information I had, including Mr.. Brasserfs report, obtained in January of last year, which as stated definitely supported the conclusions come i to after my initial investigation that reconstruction was fully warranted.27. I was for a time in constant touch with Sir William Firth and at his request undertook certain work in connection with his negotiations; I was also in close touch with the Bank concerned, whose attitude continued to be helpful.  Unfortunately, at this, time
Sir John Beynon was laid up with a severe illness, from which I am glad to say he is now recovering. The negotiations were not completed without a check, but the acceptance of Richard Thomas and Company&apos;s offer was ratified in December by the shareholders of the Ebbw Vale Company, subject to the consent of the Deben-ture Holders: Thus a home was found for the Ebbw Vale Works with even better prospects than originally contemplated and With promise of energetic development on modern lines. May the Richard Thomas Company&apos;s purchase prove successful, for on its success depend the degree and permanency of employment for numbers of unemployed workers who have so patiently waited for a place to be found inthe Iron and Steel Industry for a closed steel works, once the centre of much activity and giving work over a wide area.New Steelworks for Jarrow28. Since the close of the year, but before the date on which this Report is submitted, there has also come the welcome news that there are good prospects of new steel works being established on the site of Palmer&apos;s shipyard at Jarrow, where work ceased about fifteen years ago. I have not been directly concerned in the negotiations, which have experienced many setbacks, but repre-sentations were early made by me in appropriate quarters as to the desirability of carrying out this scheme which, apart from any claims for consideration based on need of relief of distress, had the advantage of the support of expert opinion as to the good economic position of Jarrow for the establishment of a steelworks there.29. Not only would the establishment of these important works bring relief to Jarrow, but the selection and approval of this site would furnish evidence of the economic advantages to be secured on Tyneside, which possesses such admirable river and rail facili-ties combined with an ample supply of cheap fuel and power. The gifts of nature and the enterprise of man will surely restore the prosperity of Tyneside.Need for more Industries30. The revival of steel works at Ebbw Vale and Jarrow should completely change the prospects for those two towns, which were among the worst hit communities to be found in the Special Areas a year ago. Though these results are. gratifying, the effect is rela-tively limited. There remains the problem of many other places almost, if not quite, as depressed. The establishment of two such great undertakings should give encouragement to other industries to follow the example set and to take advantage of the facilities offered in all three Special Areas committed to my care. As will to seen from later passages in this Report, I am doing all in my
power to facilitate the establishment of new industries in these areas, and I welcome the folio wing words spoken by the Prime Minister at Dundee on 29th November, 1935 :-&quot;From every point of view, from the point of view of our very civilisation, I regard the introduction of new industries in some . of those &quot; (i.e. the Special) &quot;Areas as being the most important work and the best work to which a, British citizen can devote his capital and his brains for the benefit of his. fellow men.&quot; :Further signs of improvement31. The shipbuilding and marine engineering industries in Durham and Tyneside have obtained a good number of much needed orders for merchant ships, particularly during the last quarter of the year. In addition, the Tyne has received some useful Admiralty orders, including three cruisers, six destroyers and machinery for vessels to be built elsewhere. These will give much needed employment during the year 1936 not only to the shipbuilding and marine engineering works but also to the iron and. steel and other industries supplying material and equipment.32. On the general industrial side there have been encouraging indications of new enterprise in the Special Areas, especially in the North-East. Information has reached me of, the starting of some sixteen new works, some of a definitely new character for the areas and others extensions of existing industries. Included in these are a new metal industry, new brick works, new coke-ovens and bye-products plants, and extensions to printing works, rope-manufacturing and biscuit-making factories.33. I should also mention the efforts made by Sir John Jarvis to help Jarrow, where not only has work been provided in the breaking up of the steamship &quot; Olympic &quot;but also in the estab-lishment of a new industry for the manufacture of furniture, mainly of steel (see also paragraph 373).Industrial Development CouncilsSouth. Wales34. In my First Report reference was made to the grants, amounting to  9,500, offered to the Industrial Development Council of South Wales and Monmouthshire for research work and for general purposes. The Council, under the energetic Chairman-ship of Councillor George Williams, has made good progress with its programme. The Coal Research Committee, under the Chair-manship of Mr. D. E. Roberts, has been formed, and is proceeding actively with its investigation, in which it is receiving the assistance of the Fuel Research Board. It has held five meetings and has inspected, certain working plants. A special Survey Committee, under the Chairmanship of Principal Rees, with Professor Marquand, of the University of South Wales, as Director .of the
Survey, has been formed to carry out a full survey of the area, acting where necessary in conjunction with the Coal. Besearch Committee. It is anticipated that the. Survey Committee which is making a very complete study of the area., will take about a year to complete its work. In this it will have the co-operation of the various Government Departments concerned, who have appointed officers to act as assessors to the Committee. The Council has also been giving increased attention to the matter of suitable propaganda. It has recently extended. its scope and has become the National Industrial Council of Wales and Monmouthshire; thus it will in future have the co-operation of many additional authorities.Durham and Tyneside35. The North East Development Board, under the able Chair-manship of Lord Ridley, has also made excellent progress. In my First Report I stated that I had made a grant of  9,500 to the Board for research and propaganda. The Board has arranged with Armstrong College to carry out an1 industrial survey of the area with the object of bringing up to date and developing in greater detail the work done for the Board of Trade in 1931, and a report is shortly expected. The Board is also giving serious attention to the question of stimulating the industrial development of the area and has assisted this by inaugurating a campaign to- encourage the purchase within the area of locally produced goods. I had much pleasure in attending the luncheon given by Lord Ridley and-attended by Lord Eustace Percy, the Lord Mayor of New-castle, and others, at which this campaign was launched on 28th November, 1935.36. A special allocation has been made, from my -grant, to the South-West Durham Development Board, one of the constituent members of the North-East Development Board, to permit of increased activity and in particular for a survey of the mining area in South-West Durham. Considerable progress has been made with this survey. It is hoped that it will throw light on the future prospects of the coal mining industry in that area and also on the problem of mine drainage (see also paragraph 84).West Cumberland37. It is possible now to report substantial progress in West Cumberland. In September, 1935, the formation of a Develop-ment Council for the whole area was achieved, and on 22nd November, 1935, a fully representative meeting was held at Workington, under the. Chairmanship of Lord Lonsdale, at which the Council was formally established. An influential executive Committee was appointed, under the Chairmanship of Mr. W. F. Sadler, and Lord Lonsdale has agreed to accept the position of President of the Council.   The four local authorities entitled to
operate under the Local Authorities (Publicity) Act, 1931, have agreed to do so and to work with the Development Council, whilst the i local industrial and commercial interests have also promised contributions. I have ottered the Development Council grants up to the amount of  5,000 for their development work, and they are engaged in drawing&apos;up a programme. It is hoped, therefore, that good work will be done in this area also.Travel and Industrial Development Association38. One of the conditions of my grants to the Local Development Boards and Councils has been that local authorities in the Areas should continue their support of the Travel and Industrial Develop-ment Association under the Local Authorities (Publicity) Act, 1931. I have been in consultation with the Association from time to time regarding the activities of the Industrial Development Councils and have always found them ready to help with the sound practical advice which their experience of development work enables them to give.Northern Exhibition of Inventions39. It is of the utmost. importance to industry that every en-encouragement should be given to those whose inventive genius en-ables them to contribute to industrial progress and development. I was therefore much interested in the Northern Exhibition of Inventions held at Newcastle-on-Tyne, which I visited last November. The exhibition was organised by the Newcastle &quot; Evening Chronicle &quot;, in co-operation with the Institute of Patentees, and included a North Eastern Section. A cash prize was offered by the &quot; Evening Chronicle &quot; for the best invention in this Section and a silver medal to the inventor of the exhibit adjudged the best in each of the five classifications, viz., electrical, mechanical, structural, domestic and miscellaneous.40. I.felt that this Exhibition was one of the ways of giving effect to what I had in.mind when, in paragraph 204 of my First Report, I urged that the primary effort to bring about industrial revival in the Special Areas must be made from within and that others must be made aware that those in the Areas have confidence in them-selves and in their own capacity to assist revival. I therefore made a grant for a cash prize to the medal winner in each of the five classes.Trading Estates41. There is universal agreement as to the need for attracting to and developing in the Special Areas fresh industries, particularly of the lighter type. Such industries have been increasing very rapidly in the south of England during recent years, but there has been little development on similar lines in any of the Special Areas. In my first Report I examined the reasons for this failure and further, references to the subject -will be found in paragraphs Oto 17
of the present Report. There seems no doubt that an outstanding difficulty is the lack of vacant sites in good order with adequate facilities readily available. The small industrialist seeking a site for a new factory is attracted by the admirable facilities provided so freely on estates like those at Trafford Park and at Slough, where among other advantages, he is able&apos; to obtain suitable factory premises on lease, and is repelled from the Special Areas by the lack; of such facilities and the expense of the preliminary work which he realises is necessary in their absence. In my First Re-port I suggested that the Special Areas must develop production for local consumption. Such development would be encouraged by the creation of well situated trading estates where new businesses can be established on a small scale without a heavy capital outlay on purchase of land and buildings.42. Private enterprise has hitherto refrained from establishing trading estates in the Special Areas, presumably because the risk involved is considered to be too great. The needs of the Areas, however, are such that I came to the conclusion that it was justifi-able in the circumstances to recommend the adoption of the novel and unorthodox proposal of establishing trading estates financed out of Exchequer funds. Practical measures have to be taken to provide definite inducements if new industries, are to establish themselves in these areas. While the creation of Government aided trading estates is open to some of the objections often advanced with regard to Government participation in what is normally private commercial enterprise, it seemed to me less objectionable than other suggestions which have been made for attracting industries to the areas by some disguised form of Government subsidy. I therefore proposed to the Government on the 16th August that I should be empowered to establish one or more trading estates in the Special Areas at the expense of the Special Areas Fund.43. The general purport of my proposal was that I should estab-lish and finance one or more trading estate companies, which would be companies not operating for profit, and that these companies should acquire suitable sites in the Special Areas and equip them with all the requisite facilities such as railway sidings, roads, power and, where necessary, quays. The companies should further have power to erect buildings suitable for letting on short leases to persons engaged in starting fresh enterprises, and should meet by long leases the needs of enterprises which are fully established. The trading estate company should lease these factories at fair rentals, and thus there would be no direct subsidy to private industry. -44. When the proposal was first considered, many legal difficul-ties became apparent. Fortunately, however, these have now been overcome, and I have been authorised to proceed with the establishment&apos; of one or more such trading estates.
45. The administration of such an estate will be in the hands of a trading estate company, whose Board of Directors will be com-posed mainly of representative industrialists of the area. The Board will be about eight in number, and its members will be asked to give their services in the interests of their district. It will in-clude one representative of the Government and one representative appointed directly by myself. It is hoped that on the Board there will be a representative of the workers&apos; interests. The Company will operate in close conjunction with the local Development Council, but will have an entirely independent entity. It will own the site and will be financed by grants out of the Special Areas Fund. These will be covered by a debenture on the land acquired and buildings erected.46. The first Trading Estates Company will be established in the North East. The services of public-spirited men, who command local respect and confidence, have been secured. Colonel K. C. Appleyard, J.P., has been good enough to accept the responsible position of Chairman. I am grateful to him and the other members of the Board of the North East Company who are ; Colonel R. Chapman, C.M.G., D.S.O.Commander E. R. Micklem.The Rt. Hon. The Viscount Ridley.Mr. H. A. Sisson.Mr. G. H. Walton..   Mr. W. Westwood, J.P.This Company is now about, to be formed. Its first duty will be to select that site in the North East Area which appears to the Board to be most suitable from all points of view. A Committee of the North East Development Board has already been examining a number of different sites in the area, and it submitted a most useful report prepared by Professor Daysh of Armstrong College. The Board, in selecting the site, will&apos; have the advantage of this report and also the benefit of other expert advice.47. In South Wales negotiations have been proceeding for some time for the erection of a trading estate on novel lines by private enterprise.   The organisers have been in touch with me and have satisfied me that, if they can reach a satisfactory agreement with the local authority concerned, they could establish an estate which would give excellent facilities.   In the circumstances I felt that it was unfair to embarrass this Company by proposing at the same time to start another estate in competition with it.   I therefore told the Company that, provided the period required for the corn-1 pletion of their negotiations were not unduly prolonged, I would i not proceed to establish a rival trading estate financed from the 1 Special Areas Fund.     The Company&apos;s negotiations are still ii 1 progress. j.J
48. The necessity or advisability of such an estate in Cumberland has not yet been fully established. I understand that the matter will come before the Cumberland Development Council, which has only recently been created, and I propose to give the question further consideration in the light of any recommendation which they may make.49. In my First Report reference was made to the difficulty of getting capital for the establishment of new or the expansion of existing industries in the Special Areas, and I indicated that I might find it necessary to advise that a special fund should be created for the purpose.Finance for new or expanding Industries50. The difficulty relates in the main to the smaller industries, but these are precisely the industries for which in my view there is the greatest need in the Special Areas at the present time. If the Areas are to share in the general economic revival of the Country, they must no longer depend solely on a comparatively few heavy industries. In the Areas there is a large population with a considerable spending power, and there are clearly opportunities of producing with advantage in the Areas many of the goods at present obtained from outside.51. There is no need here to examine at length the reasons why difficulty is experienced in obtaining capital to finance new in-dustries in the Special Areas. The all-important fact is that the difficulty exists and is the subject of constant representation from each area. It is difficult to make issues for public subscription for Companies requiring a small amount of capital. It is not the function of the Joint Stock Banks to finance new enterprises. The Merchant Banks do not generally interest themselves in small concerns needing a few thousand pounds, and the organisations which have been specially created to deal with the finance of these concerns seem to devote their attention mainly to the expansion of businesses which can show a satisfactory balance sheet and have assets to offer as security. I have referred many inquirers to these organisations, but very few have been able to give the proof of their &apos;&apos; credit worthiness &apos;&apos; which is needed before assistance can be obtained.52. Shortly after my First Report was rendered I came to the conclusion that, if the Areas were to be given a good chance of partaking in the general economic recovery of the country and in the advantage of the present abundance of cheap money, it was essential that further facilities should be provided and that a fund should be created and used for the express purpose of stimulating the establishment of new industries and expansion of existing in-dustries in the Areas. The Special Areas Fund cannot, of course, be used for this purpose, and I therefore submitted a recommenda-tion on the 26th July that a special fund should be created.
53. I realised that this recommendation would not be easy of acceptance and would require careful consideration. I am of the opinion that Government Funds should not generally be used to finance private enterprise, and I hoped that the necessary fund would be put up by financial interests in the City.&apos; However, if private financial interests are not prepared to find the necessary money without some Government guarantee, I should regard the giving of such guarantee as one of those unorthodox measures essential to the Special Areas if they are to be given opportunities for effective recovery. The use of the Fund should be limited to the Special Areas and the period of the loans defined.54. Such a Fund would be valuable in connection with the pro-posed trading estates referred to in paragraphs 41 to 48 above. If the Fund is created, there is every reason to believe that new enterprise, encouraged by the formation of trading estates, will increasingly make use of the facilities afforded.Government Action55. On 22nd October, 1935, I made representation under Section 1 (3) (6) of the Special Areas Act to the heads of the three Service Departments urging that, in the contemplated programme for the Defence Services, as many orders as possible should be placed in the Special Areas. I have received assurances in each case that the areas will be considered, and that they have, in fact, already been considered in a number of instances when large contracts have been placed.56. I have on several occasions represented to the Government the desirability of considering the claims of the Special Areas if they decide to erect any new munition works. I have been assured that these representations will be carefully considered, and an in-dication of the Government&apos;s sympathy with this claim was given by the Prime Minister when speaking in the House of Commons on 3rd December.   He then said : &apos;&apos; I hope that before very long it may be possible that some of the changes that must be taking place in the re-allocation of work in connection with munitions, and in the movement to areas less liable to disturbance in case of trouble than places where some of them are situated to-day I hope it may be possible to place some of those works in some of those special areas. I repeat again that what is good enough for the Govern-ment is good enough for anyone else.&quot;57. Further opportunities for giving preferential treatment to the Special Areas were presented by the decision of the Govern-ment during 1935 to give financial assistance to&apos; railway electrifica-tion in London and to&apos; the general development of the railway services. In both cases the Government promised to introduce legislation involving the use of Government credit, and it was
possible therefore, for the Government .to insist, in return, on reasonable preference for the Special Areas as regards supply of material and employment of labour .from those areas.   I had no hesitation in urging the Government to use these opportunities for the benefit, of the Areas, and I am glad to report . that, they agreed and inserted a clause to give effect to these ,proposals. in their agreements with .the Railway Companies and in ithe?sub-sequent &apos; legislation.   As I hope this clause will be accepted as the model for any other agreements of the same type, it is worth recording in full :  &quot;All plant machinery and materials required in connection-with the said works shall so far as practicable be of United Kingdom origin and all manufactured articles shall (unless the Treasury shall otherwise agree in writing) be wholly mamrfactured in the United Kingdom  (preference being given other things being equal to firms in the Special Areas as defined in the First Schedule to the Special Areas (Development and Tm-provement) Act, 1934), and all contracts relating to the said works shall require the contractors to certify on their own behalf and on behalf of their sub-contractors that such stipula-tions shall be carried out and the Railway Companies shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that such stipulations are observed by their contractors and shall report to the Treasury any modification.of or:failure to give such Certificate.&quot;58. On every other occasion that has presented itself I have endeavoured to 1 press that * the &apos; maximum degree of preference should be exercised in favour of the Special Areas in respect of all expenditure controlled by the Government. To this end I attended in July a meeting of the Contracts Co-ordinating Committee, an Inter-Departmental Committee with representatives from the principal Departments which place contracts, and discussed with them various suggestions which had been made for increasing the proportion of Government contracts allotted to firms in * the Special Areas. Some of these suggestions were found on examination to be impracticable, but I was satisfied that all the spending Depart-ments were keeping constantly in mind the possibility of helping the Special Areas and that they accepted the principle recom-mended in paragraph 209 of my First Report that, whenever possible, with due regard to price and quality, contracts should be placed with firms in:the depressed areas.59. Owing to the imposition of tariffs in this country and un-settled conditions; in: certain countries abroad, it came to my.notice thata number of foreign firms were considering the establishment of industries in this country. I have through the Trade and:Indus-trial Development Association and in other ways been in touch with the representatives of some of those firms with a view to exercising persuasion on behalf of the Special Areas, and, though no definite result has as yet accrued, I.am hopeful of success in more than.one instance.
Industrial Works of Public Utility-Deep Water Quays on the South Bank of the River Tyne60. A description of the proposed deep water quays on the South Bank of the Tyne between Jarrow and South Shields was given in paragraph 70 of my First Report. An essential feature of this scheme is that arrangements should be made for Tyne Dock, now owned by the London and North Eastern Railway Company, to be transferred to the Tyne Improvement Commission. At the time of my First Report a deadlock had been reached in the negotiations between these two bodies with regard to this transfer.Since then I have had lengthy negotiations with representatives of both bodies, and have put before them a proposal, involving an additional grant from the Special Areas Fund, which it is antici-pated will overcome the difficulties. Both parties are anxious to find a solution and are in friendly conference for that purpose. If the work can be put in hand on this important scheme, further improved facilities will be offered by the Tyne and these should lead to&apos; increased traffic and industrial development.Improvement of navigation on the River Tyne61. The recent provision of deep water quays by Newcastle Cor-poration, with further deep water accommodation in prospect on both sides of the river in the upper reaches, should have the effect of attracting larger ships to those reaches. To improve navigation it was suggested to me in October by the Tyne Improvement Corn-mission that it was desirable to remove an obstruction on the south bank of the river near Felling and to widen the river at that spot. Some old coal-tipping staiths need to be abolished,, and certain dredging and excavation to be carried out. I received independent expert advice that such measures would undoubtedly help naviga-tion at this point. Such being the case, it was clear that the measures were calculated to lead to the economic development of the area. I accordingly made an offer to the Tyne Improvement Commission of a small grant towards the cost of the scheme. This has been accepted and the scheme will be proceeded with.Sunderland Fish Quay62. In the early part of last year the Sunderland Corporation submitted to me certain proposals for the construction of a Fish Quay. They stated that, owing to the fact that the South Entrance to the Docks was closed during the War and has not been re-opened, the small group of steam trawlers operating from Sunder-land had lost their former base of operations and that it had been found impossible to provide them with a suitable permanent station elsewhere in the port. It was, therefore, proposed to build a new Fish Quay adjoining the Corporation Deep Water Quay. I caused the proposals to be investigated, both from a technical standpoint
and from the point of view that a development of the fish trade at Sunderland might have unfavourable reactions on the prosperity of the fishing trade in the neighbouring ports of North Shields and Hartlepool. I was advised that there were certain criticisms to be made on technical grounds but that there was no reason, to think that such local development of the fishing trade as was projected at Sunderland would have any ill effect on the neigh-bouring ports. I, therefore, told the Corporation that I was favourably disposed towards the construction of a Fish Quay, sub-ject to agreement on technical details.63. Meanwhile the Sunderland Corporation, who already had a Bill before Parliament, submitted to Parliament certain additional clauses, relating to the proposed Fish Quay, to be added to the Bill. Owing to the lateness of the submission of these clauses, they had to come before the Standing Orders Committee, who on 14th May decided, after hearing the Corporation and certain objectors, that the Standing Orders might be waived and the clauses be allowed to go forward. The clauses were in due course considered by the Standing Committee on Group H of Private Bills, which decided on 17th June that the additional clauses could not be allowed. No further progress has been made with the proposalsWhitehaven Harbour64. In my First Report I stated that I had made an offer of financial assistance for the improvement of. this harbour, which the Harbour Authority, however, did not see their way to accept; but that the matter was being re-examined with a. view to assessing the increased trade likely to accrue and ascertaining if a practicable and acceptable scheme could be prepared. A number of alternative schemes of harbour improvement were examined, but the un-fortunate closing down of the Whitehaven Collieries on 12th October, and the fact that no early progress seems likely in the matter of the development of the Gypsum deposits, have clearly made it advisable not to consider any large expenditure on the harbour at the present time. I am, however^ examining certain proposals recently submitted by the Harbour Commissioners which, though involving a decreased expenditure, will make a substantial improvement in the existing facilities of the harbour, and will enable larger ships to enter it than is possible at present.Maryport Harbour65. The work of dredging this harbour, which was referred to in my First Report, was completed satisfactorily, and the cost was met out of the Special Areas Fund. The harbour was made open to navigation, and the immediate danger of its being closed was averted. Unfortunately, however, very considerable damage has been done to the harbour by a recent gale.
66. It appeared that much of the: siltingi was due to deposits by certain. Collieries and other works on the shore to the south*of the harbour, and an investigation into the causes of the. silting, of the harbour and. into- the action which it may be possible to take to minimize this danger in the future has been made with the valuable help of the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Transport. I have now received reports on this subject and full reports on the: damage done by,the gale. These raise a number of difficult questions which are being subjected to careful examination.River Severn Bridge67. I mentioned in my First Report that I had asked.that sympathetic consideration should be given to the scheme put forward by the Gloucestershire County Council for the construction of a road bridge over the Severn, and in October I made formal recommendation to the Minister of Transport under Section 1 (3) (6) of the Special Areas Act, urging that every possible facility should be given to this project. I am pleased to record that the Minister has informed the Gloucestershire County Council that, subject to approval by Parliament of the proposals for a road bridge over the Severn at English Stones, and to satisfactory contributions being received from the authorities who can properly be held to benefit by its construction, he is prepared to make a grant of 75 per cent, from the Road Fund towards the cost, not exceeding 480&apos;,000, of an approved scheme.I hope that this project will be pressed forward with all speed because the bridge will open a new gateway to South Wales, will considerably reduce the distance to it by road from London, Bristol and the South, and will, I am convinced, assist the economic recovery of the Welsh Special Areas. I trust too that it will be found possible to employ a fair proportion of the unemployed miners from (South Wales, particularly on the construction of the approach roads.Clearance of Sites68. In addition to the provision of sites for the establishment of trading estates referred to in paragraph 43, I have been prepared to assist local authorities or other public bodies in the clearance of sites and their development for industrial purposes or for the economic improvement of their localities. The following paragraphs give a brief description of the principal works of this kind which have been approved.69. It will be observed that nearly all the schemes of this nature so far approved are in the North Eastern Special Area, where there is the greatest need for work of this type. The schemes are generally connected with riverside sites which were developed in a past industrial era and have since become derelict. The sites in South Wales, where there is scope for work of this type, are mainly outside the Special Area.
Gateshead County Borough Council-East Gateshead Clearance70. This scheme covers the acquisition and clearance by the Borough Council of a.large area of land fronting the river in the north-east ward of the Borough. The sites concerned lie mainly between the western boundary of the Salt Meadows Estate on the west, and the Gateshead-Felling boundary on the east, and total about 180 acres. The area presents a deplorable appearance both from landward and from the river side. It is to a large extent covered with chemical waste dumps deposited many years ago from neighbouring chemical works, now closed down, and with a number of derelict buildings in various stages of dilapidation.71. The scheme proposed provides for the acquisition and clear -ance of the land with a view to the provision of sites suitable for the establishment of new, or the extension of existing, industries. On the extreme south-east of the site, adjoining the Gateshead-Felling boundary, lies an immense chemical waste dump covering many acres. It would not be possible economically to render this site suitable for industrial development. I am therefore consider-ing whether it would not be possible to clear the ground and lay it out as an open space. It would prove a useful adjunct to sites provided for new industries. In this connection I have received some valuable suggestions from the Waste Lands Committee of the Tyneside Council of Social Service, who recently surveyed the area in question. The total cost of the whole scheme cannot at present be determined, as the original proposals have been considerably extended. The original cost of the clearance of about 120 acres only was estimated at  18,270, and I have already indicated my willing-ness to make to the Gateshead Council a grant for this scheme, if undertaken.Gateshead County Borough Council Rabbit Banks Improvement72. The site of this scheme covers a narrow stretch of derelict and waste land lying immediately to the east of King Edward Bridge over the Biver Tyne, and constitutes an eyesore which seriously detracts from the general appearance of the town at a point of considerable prominence-. The land slopes steeply towards the river and for this reason it is unsuitable for building. I have approved a scheme for the laying out of this site to form a small public open space. The scheme will effect a great improvement in the aspect of the river at this point, whilst providing facilities for rest and enjoyment for the inhabitants of this congested area. The work is estimated to cost  8,650.Tyne Improvement Commissioner^ Site between Hebburn and Jarrow73. This scheme provides for the clearance by the Commissioners of a derelict site owned by them of approximately 15 acres in extent, between Jarrow and Hebburn, and also for the provision of road and railway communication, the construction of a quay
mand the dredging of the river to allow a depth alongside of 25 ft. at low water. The work will take nine to ten months to com-plete and the total estimated cost is  60,000. I have made an offer to the Commissioners of a grant on terms which have been accepted.South Shields County Borough Council Clearance of Derelict Sites74. This is a scheme for the clearance of an area of about 35 acres on the south bank of the River Tyne extending from Groyne Pier at the mouth of the river to the Market Place Perry. The area concerned consists in the main of unoccupied land covered by derelict buildings, and presents an extremely dilapidated and un-attractive appearance both from landward and from the river side; consequently, it exercises a detrimental and discouraging influence on visitors to Tyneside. The clearance and general levelling of the site, will, it is hoped, create valuable new sites which will be avail-able for the extension of existing, and the establishment of.new, industries. The work is estimated to cost about  80,000, towards which I have promised a grant.Tynemouth County Borough Council (1) Lay-out of the Banks of Sites cleared of Slums; (2) Strenthening the Cliff Side, and laying out and improving the River Banks75. The first part of this Scheme provides for the treatment of four areas of land on the river front recently cleared of slum pro-perty. The proposals provide for the cutting and trimming of the banks, and for the construction of a small retaining wall to hold up the land above. This will then be laid out as an open space. The work when completed will have the effect of enhancing the appearance of this part of the town, whose present unsightly con-dition it not conducive to enquiries in connection with the develop-ment of adjoining industrial areas.76. Under the second part of the Scheme the cliff side is to be strengthened, and the river banks are to be protected against further erosion, which has done considerable damage to valuable property in recent years. The land is to be cleared and levelled, with the result that it would effect a great improvement in the appearance of the river bank, especially to traffic coming up the river. The strengthening of the cliff side will also permit of the site imme-diately above being used for the purpose of the erection of a large block of flats, which will be laid out in such a manner as further to improve the attractiveness of the river entry. The total cost of the whole scheme is estimated to about  36,000, towards which I have indicated my willingness to make a grant.
Sunderland County Borough Council-Construction of Sea Wall at Eoker77. This proposal provides for the construction of a revetment wall to be built as a continuation of the existing sea wall, for the purpose of protecting the cliffs on this part of the coast, which is visited annually by thousands of people from Durham and Tyneside. Sections of the cliffs are within a few yards of the main Whitburn road, and one effect of the scheme will be to diminish the danger to the road from the encroachment of the sea. The estimated cost of the work is  19,000, and I have promised a grant towards its cost.West Hartlepool County Borough Council Improvement Schemes at Seaton Carew78. These are two associated schemes designed for the purpose of effecting improvement to the sea front at Seaton Carew, a sea-side resort of some importance to industrial workers in the sur-rounding districts. The proposals provide for the excavation and levelling of the land concerned, the construction of footpaths, the provision of seats, grass lawns, and the planting of tre&apos;es and shrub-beries. The effect of this should be to render this part of the town much more attractive to visitors. The two schemes are estimated to cost a total of about  23,000, excluding the cost of certain minor road works which I am unable to assist. I have, however, promised a grant towards the approved cost of the works, exclusive of the cost of such road works.Merthyr Tydfil County Borough79. I am at present considering with the Borough Council pro-posals which involve the acquisiton and clearance of a large site within the boundaries of the Borough. The site, which has good road and rail communications, is at present derelict. The scheme provides for the clearance and levelling of the land, as a result of which it is considered that some excellent sites would be provided for future industrial development. Should a satisfactory scheme be finally agreed upon, I am prepared to make a substantial grant towards the cost.Pit Drainage The Problem in South Wales80. In my First Report (paragraphs 73 to 80), I described at some length a comprehensive scheme for the free drainage of a large part of the South Wales Coalfield which was propounded in 1934 by Mr. J, Macleod Carey, the President of the South Wales Institute of Engineers. I pointed out that, following upon a meet-ing between the Secretary for Mines (then Mr. Ernest Brown, M.P.) and representatives of the. South-Wales Coal Owners, at
which, Mr.. Carey &apos;s scheme and the problems it dealt, with. were discussed, the Coal Owners and Royalty&apos; Owners concerned set up a special Committee of Inquiry, which in its turn appointed an internal Commission of ten to investigate the problem, with the assistance of an Engineer (Mr. Llewellyn Jacob) and to report upon the scheme. This Mr. Jacob did at the beginning of last year, after a detailed enquiry, in the course of which he was assisted by another experienced Engineer, Mr. E. C. Porster Brown, who acted in a consultant capacity. In his report Mr. Jacob agreed with Mr. Carey that the water constituted a serious menace which would in course of time have an increasingly prejudicial effect upon the safe and economical working of the large remaining reserves of coal in South Wales. He further expressed the view that the general principles put forward by Mr. Carey in his scheme were sound ; though he pointed, out that for the purposes of his report he had before him only that scheme, and no definite alternative proposals. ;81. In March, 1935, as I recorded in my First Report, I met representatives of the South Wales Coal Owners for. discussion of the proposed drainage scheme, and they informed me that, for various reasons their members1 were not unanimous as to the need for any such scheme, and that further investigation and discus-sion would be necessary. Further inquiries were made accordingly, and as a result, in September, 1935, the South Wales Coalfield Drainage Inquiry Committee announced that they had decided to accept the recommendation Of their advisory Commission that a scheme of Gravity Drainage should not be proceeded with at the, present time.82. This is not the place in which to deal in detail with the considerations which led the Drainage Inquiry Committee to reach this decision, but the more important may be briefly summarized as follows. First and foremost, there is the question of safety. The consulting Engineers view with some doubts the possibility of constructing a tunnel which would be free from the dangers inherent in any such scheme. Movements of the strata may take place as a consequence of mining subsidence, and it is a matter of grave doubt whether in such an event the tunnel could be regarded as necessary with due regard to the maintenance of safety. With a view to avoiding this danger, the possibility of finding a channel, by which the water could be conveyed through ground which has not been, and would not likely to be, affected by the working of the minerals underneath, was explored. Unfortunately, even by altering and substantially lengthening the route of the proposed channel, no satisfactory solution was discovered. Secondly, apart from capital outlay, the annual cost, including allowance for main-tenance and amortisation, would be in excess of the present cost of dealing with the water by pumping. Thirdly, a considerable quantity of water is required at the collieries for surface operations,
such as Washeries, Steam Raising Plant, etc. The establishment of a gravity drainage system would not eliminate the necessity for these undertakings to continue to maintain pumping plant for this purpose.83. This is a proposition which obviously should not be em-barked upon unless found technically sound, and it cannot, therefore, be pressed in view of the nature of the report made by expert mining engineers.The Problem in South West Durham84. It will be remembered that Captain Euan Wallace referred in his report on the North East Area to the problem of flooding in the mining area of South West Durham. In paragraph 36 of this report I mention that part of my grant to the North East Development Board was to be allocated specially to the South West Durham Board, and I decided, after consultation with Mines Department, that one of fhe most urgent problems to be examined was that of the future prospects of the South West coal area. Accordingly, when it was proposed by the South West Durham Board to appoint an Engineer to carry out a special survey of the problem, I immediately agreed that part of my grant should be allocated, for this purpose. Mr. Arthur Hedley was accordingly appointed as consulting engineer to carry out the investigation. He has now made a preliminary report on the subject.Exhibition at Charing Cross Underground Railway Station85. The London Passenger Transport Board kindly offered me, free of rent, the use of space in the Charing Cross Underground Railway Station for an Exhibition to be devoted to the Special Areas. This I gratefully accepted. They also secured the co-operation of Messrs. Pritchard, Wood and Partners, Ltd., Incor-porated Practitioners in Advertising, as honorary advisers in the designing of the Exhibition.86. The objects which I hope to attain by this Exhibition, which is to be open from 30th January to 15th February, are to tell the London public something of the story of the Special Areas, and perhaps to indicate ways in which they can assist. As the Exhi-prohibition has now been opened and descriptions have appeared in the Press, it is hardly necessary to include any account of it in this Report.87. The Exhibition has been designed in collaboration with the Ministry of Labour, my District Commissioners, and the Develop-ment organisations in the Areas. Many of the firms in the Areas have given assistance in what I hope will prove a useful, if some-what restricted, enterprise. Limitations of space have necessarily reduced the scope of the Exhibition as far as the display of the products and activities of the Areas are concerned.
88. I take this opportunity of expressing my grateful thanks to the London Passenger Transport Board, who have not only provided the space but have given valuable assistance and advice in many directions concerned with the arrangements for the Exhibition; and. to Messrs. Pritchard, Wood and Partners, Ltd., who have unreservedly placed at my disposal their technical skill and expert knowledge, and have spared no effort to make the Exhibition a success.Science and Industry89. In June last I received, through my District Commissioner for the North Eastern number of interesting reports fromthe Newcastle Section of the Society of Chemical Industry, repre-senting the work of a committee constituted by the local sections of the Institute of Chemistry, the Chemical Society and the Society of Chemical Industry. The reports contained a number of recom-mendations calling attention to the great need for the extended employment in industry of scientific personnel and for an intensive application of scientific methods in the local industries, and out-lining a number of directions in which scientific research might usefully be undertaken in the North Eastern, area. In particular, there was a strong plea for financial support for the Armstrong College for the provision of increased facilities for chemical and physical research work. The reports were published in the local press.   .90. I have been in communication with the various Government Departments concerned with these recommendations, including the Board of Trade, Board of Education, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the University Grants Committee, with a view to investigating how far Government action can be taken to follow up the Society&apos;s recommendations. The recommendation regarding financial sup-port for the Armstrong College is, I understand, being sympathetic-thetically examined by the Departments concerned.91. The necessity of the increased employment by industry of scientific methods is a matter which has constantly been stressed by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and it is again emphasised in the latest report issued by that Department.* The Department have always attached very great importance to the point that the initiative in the application of science to industry must come in the first instance from industry itself. It accord-ingly seemed to me that very useful action, in the directions recommended by the Society in regard both to the general recom-mendations and to certain particular items, could be taken by the North. East Development Board. I, therefore, asked my District Commissioner to&apos; put the reports before them in connection with* Report of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research 19 34-35.

In paragraphs 18 to 33 I have referred to certain encouraging indications which suggest that industry in the Special Areas in the present year may show some appreciable improvement. There are, however, a number of factors at work in the general industrial situation which may militate against any material increase of em-.ployment in the Special Areas. These factors make it all the more necessary to press on with the dual policy of endeavouring to establish fresh industries in the Areas and of transferring as many of the unemployed as possible to suitable employment in other parts of the country.93. That the problem of the Special Areas is in fact one of a special character is maintained in a very interesting and valuable report published in August last by the Armstrong College, New-castle. In this report it is pointed out that most of the unemploy-raent, which has persisted in this country since the end of the war and is concentrated in certain well defined regions, differs in character from that associated with the ordinary trade cycle. It is suggested that, in considering this unemployment, it is necessary to distinguish between influences which are temporary and those which are permanent, and that, whilst the former may diminish of themselves, the latter require some sort of re-adjustment; and that further study of these influences is required in order to dis-cover the right adjustments.94. The authors of this report support their views by quoting the statistics relating to the North East coast area; and the statistics for the &apos;Special Areas as a whole suggest that the same considera-tions equally apply. The following table shows the number of insured persons in July, 1934 and 1935, and the numbers of un-employed in December, 1934 and 1935, in the Special Areas and in the rest of the country :
It will be .seen that, whilst there was a small increase in the number,of unemployed in West Cumberland in December, 1935, as compared with December, 1934, the two remaining areas show decreases. The decrease for the Special Areas as a whole is 26,418, or 7-7 per cent, of the 1934 figure, while for the rest of England and Wales the decrease is 160,650, or 11-4 per cent.; that is to say, unemployment is decreasing in the rest of the country nearly half as fast again as in the Special Areas. Indeed, if it had not ,been for.the transference schemes of the Ministry of Labour and certain voluntary bodies, which enabled nearly 22,000 unemployed persons from the Special Areas to obtain suitable. employment in other parts of the country during 1935, there would, during the year have been little decrease in unemployment in the Special Areas, It will be observed also that the number of insured persons in the Special Areas has fallen between July, 193.4, and July, 1935, by 12,120, a figure nearly half of that by which the unemployment figure,in the Special Areas has improved. At the same time, the number of insured in the rest of the country had increased by over 95,000. The real improvement in the Special Areas in. the number of persons employed is, therefore, much less than would appear to be the case from a consideration of the statistics of unemployment alone.It will also be noticed that the number of insured has remained practically stationary in the case of West Cumberland, while the other Areas each show a decrease of about 6,000:.-95. The slowness of the improvement in the Special Areas as compared with the rest, of the country is, of course, to be ascribed very largely to the preponderance in the Areas of industries such as coal and shipping, largely dependant on export trade, which have not participated in the general industrial improvement in the country as a whole. It is open to doubt, for reasons which will be indicated below, whether such improvement as can be expected in the near future in the heavy industries and development of the lighter industries, even on the scale which has prevailed recently outside the Special Areas, can result in an adequate improvement in the employment position in the Areas.96. These considerations are not given in any spirit of despair or pessimism, but the facts must be recorded and examined; they must be faced if an accurate forecast of the prospects is to be made and the situation is to be faithfully dealt with.97. As regards the heavy industries, a factor to be borne in mid in assessing future capacity for employment, in conjunction wil the prospect of increased production, is the generally increased efficiency of operation, arising from mechanisation and improved organisation, which is likely to lead to a decrease in the number of those employed. The point is illustrated below by reference to the coal, iron and steel and shipbuilding industries the three heavy industries which have for generations been the mainstay of the Special Areas.
Coal98. The increased application of mechanisation to the coal in-dustry is indicated in the following table :  -	Coal out by machines.	Percentage of coal raised. V:.:           &apos;	Coal mechanically conveyed.	Percentage.	million tons.		million tons.	1929	72-0	28	37	141934	103 - 7	47	81-5	37Thus, in the five-year period, the proportion of the total output of coal which was cut by machines increased from 28 per cent, to 47 per cent., while the proportion of coal mechanically conveyed increased from 14 per cent, to 37 per cent.For the Special Areas, the increases in the proportion of coal cut by machines between 1929 and 1934 were as shown in the following table :: -	South Wales.	Northumber-land.	Durham.	Cumberland and Westmorland.1929 1934	9% 15%	55% 84%	22 37	11 38It will be seen that, except in Northumberland, the percentage of coal cut by machines in the Special Areas in 1934 is far below the average for the country as a whole. It is reasonable therefore to expect a further increase in the percentage of coal cut by machines in the Special Areas.99. The effect of these developments is seen in the fact that the output per man shift in 1929 was 21-69 cwts., and in 1934 22-94, while 1935 shows a further increase to rather over 23 cwts. A further indication of the fact that the coalmining industry is not affording increased employment is shown by the steady and heavy fall in the number of persons recorded as insured in that industry. For Great Britain the number in 1929 was 1,074,610, in 1934 was 981,450 and in 1935, 938,560. This shows a decrease of 136,050 over the whole period, the last year contributing nearly 13,000 to the total. For the Special Area coalfields (which include a small proportion outside the scheduled areas), the corresponding figures are 448,780 for 1929; 401,920 for 1934; and 384,470 for 1935. The fall for the whole period is 64,310 of which 17,450 took place in the last year.34 1 82 b s!
100. Some indication of the general trend of development is given by the. fact that the output of coal in the week ending 15th December, 1934, was 5,036,600 tons, with 770,000 persons em-ployed, while that in the week ending 14th December, 1935, was 5,159,500 tons, with 755,5^00 persons employed; an increase of output of 122,900 tons of coal, with a decrease of 14,800 workers, In actual fact, the average number of days on which coal was wound in the earlier week was about one-fifth of a day less than in. the later Week. This Would fully account for the increased output but the figures do suggest that, with more regular working, a greater output can be obtained from the mines, without any addition to the numbers employed.101. It must also be realised that the further merging of under-takings operating in the same coal fields will be another cause affecting adversely the number of workers required. Work will naturally be concentrated upon the more easily worked seams, and difficult or unproductive mines wijl tend to be abandoned. Such developments, while they may result in better earnings and more regular woi&apos;k for those who remain in employment, will certainly not add to the numbers employed. It will be evident then, from a consideration of the various factors mentioned above, that even a substantial increase in the demand for&apos; coal may be unlikely to result in siny increase in the number of workers employed and that the future outlook presents the possibility that the numbers em-ployed may further decrease.102. It is often stated that the solution of the coal problem lies in the possibility of production of oil from coal on a scale sufficient to supply our domestic demand for oil and its various products. At the present time oil obtained by the hydrogenation of coal can only compete with the natural product with a substantial measure of tariff preference. The amount that can be&apos; produced from coal by other processes is strictly limited by the demand for coke and gas. I welcome the various experiments which are being made with the possibility of producing increased quantities of oil from coal on a commercial basis and at a reasonable price, and I have urged that, if further experiments of this nature are undertaken, some of the works should be established in or close to the South Wales coalfield. Nevertheless, the extent of the practicable increase in. the consumption of coal by this means appears to be limited, and the assumption of a substantial revival of the coal industry due to extraction Of oil is doubtful, if not linwarranted.Iron and Steel te103. While it is well known that improved processes of pro-dUction and mechanisation have been proceeding in the Iron and Steel industry as in others, accurate figures of the nature of those relating to coalmining are not available. Much can be learnt; however, from a study of the figures of production and of m-employment for recent years.
104. In the pig-iron industry two factors have been operating, a-reduction in the demand as compared with 1929 and a still greater reduction in employment. In 1929, the output was 7,589,300 tons and the number of insured works 22,070, with a percentage of unemployment (in July) of 10-1. In 1934, the-, output was 5,969,100 tons, the number of insured workers .16,370, and the July unemployment percentage was 23-2. That is to say, a fall in production of 21-3 per cent, accompanied by a reduction in insured workers of 25-8 per cent, with a more than doubled nn-employment percentage. For 1935, the output was appreciably greater at 6,426,400 tons though this was still about 15 per cent, less than the 1929 output; while the number of insured workers had fallen further to 16,130 with a rather smaller unemployment percentage of 20-9.105. The crude steel production tells a similar story. The out-put in 1929 was 9,636,200 tons (the highest since the War), insured workers numbered 178,720 and the unemployment per-centage was 19.9. In 1934 output was 8,849,700 tons, the insured workers numbered 168,040 and the unemployment percentage was 24-9. Thus the production was less by 8-2 per cent., insured workers were fewer by just 5 per cent., a slightly smaller figure, but the unemployment percentage was much higher. The move-ment in 1935 was much more definite. The output for the year, 9,842,400 tons, appreciably exceeded that of 1929 and showed an increase over 1934 exceeding 11 per cent. Nevertheless, the number of insured workers had fallen further, by nearly 4 per cent., to 161,870, while the unemployment percentage at 22.7 per cent, was only slightly less than that of 1934. Comparing the past year with 1929, we find that, with a greater output, the number of insured workers had fallen by nearly 10 per cent, and the un-employment percentage was appreciably higher. There is uh-doubtedly hope of a substantial increase in the demand for steel, and this will improve local prospects of employment in districts where new works are opened, but it would evidently require a very considerable expansion indeed to enable the industry to do more than absorb the whole of the workers at present recorded as insured in the industry.Shipbuilding106. Merchant shipbuilding has been passing through a period of unexampled depression, the tonnage of ships launched in 1933 having fallen to the very low figure of 131,000 tons, as compared with an average of 1,230,000 tons per annum for the five years 1927-1931. The output increased in 1934 to just over 458,000 tons and in 1935 to just under 500,000 tons. For some reason, which is not clear, the fall in the proportion, of the total output in Great Britain and Ireland built on the North East Coast, including the Tees, to which attention was called in the 1931 Industrial Survey, continued until 1934 when the proportion was only some 14-5 per 34183 B 3
celxt. of the total. As mentioned in paragraph 31, there was during the latter part of 1935 a welcome increase in the orders for new shipping and a satisfactory share of these was secured by the North Eastern area. By the end of the year, the proportion had risen to 27 per cent, as compared with nearly 44 per cent, for the years 1927 to 1930 and over 50 per cent, before the War. There is the expectation that the new Admiralty programme will further benefit the Tyne. It cannot, however, be expected that this will bring Tyneside back to a full measure of prosperity. Admiralty orders must always represent only a minority of the shipbuilding programme. For example, for the seven years prior to the War, they represented just over 8 per cent, of the ship-building work on the North East Coast.107. It is expected that during the present year the tonnage under construction in the country, which for the last two years has been on an average about 550,CK)0 tons, will rise to about 750,000 tons fore-shadowing an output of say 650,000 tons for the year. While this is a welcome improvement, it must be pointed out that these figures are less than half of those ruling in 1929 and that it would foe unwise to look forward with any confidence to any sub-stantial increase on the 1936 figures during the next few years. During the past decade there has been a steady increase in the efficiency of shipping due to a number of factors.   The increasing use. of aids to navigation of various kinds, notably wireless tele-graphy, has resulted in greatly diminished losses and in increased speed of operation.   In addition to this, there have been quite re-markable developments in the ships themselves in the direction of improvements of hull form, propeller design and engine efficiency. It;has been stated by a well known Naval Architect that, whereas the cargo ship of about ten years ago carrying 8,000&apos; tons dead-weight consumed from 26 to 28 tons of coal per day for a speed of about 9 knots, the present day ship of that type can attain a similar speed with less than half of that coal consumption.   This means both greater cargo carrying capacity and considerable saving of time in the loading of bunkers.   It is also true that service speeds have been substantially increased for many types of ship, above the former average of 9 knots.   Finally, there has been a steady re-duction in the time required for loading and unloading on account both of improvements in the layout of the ships and of the de-velopment of more efficient loading and unloading appliances at the ports.108. Taking&apos;all these factors into account, it is undeniable that even a greatly increased international trade could now be handled by a reduced number of ships and that, as the modern ships come more and more into use, fewer in number will be required than in the past. It cannot be expected, therefore, that the shipbuilding industry in the future will require so many workers as it has done
in the past, especially when account is also:taken, of the fact that improved methods. in the shipyards have reduced the time required. for building-109. Another factor, to which passing reference may be made, is the development of aircraft which will compete increasingly with ships for passenger and goods traffic where saving of time is essential. Such development, while it.can hardly affeet seriously the hulk, of traffic, .will tend to capture the most remunerative part.Other Industries110. The above represent three industries of primary importance in the Special.Areas,of England and Wales, and they are all in-cluded among, the industries mentioned in the article in the Ministry of Labour Gazette:of December, 1935, as industries which show a reduction in the number of insured persons in employment between 1923 and 1935. There are, however, represented in the Areas some of.the:industries.mentioned in that article as showing increases in the numbers employed.. Among-these are various branches of the. electrical-industry, non-ferrous metals, the building trade and a number of.other connected trades, such as bricks and tiles, paints and-furniture. It is, however, unfortunate that the. Special Areas have.:succeeded so far in;: attracting little of the work connected with two of the mpst promising of the expanding industries, namely, the motor vehicle and air craft industries. Greater attention should also foe : paid generally in the. areas to the production of articles, of everyday consumption, as it is evident that, at the :present time, much of&apos;the money spent In the areas is spent in goods produced outside them.111. I have elsewhere in this Report stressed the necessity of starting new industries in the Special Areas. The amount of direct employment provided in new factories does not give a complete picture of the total benefits arising, as the starting up of new factories gives employment, in the first place, to- those building them, and, in the second place, to those who supply them when they are under way, with machinery, materials, power, etc. The provision of this-employment also creates additional consuming power and increases the general level of prosperity. It is to these factors just as much as to the actual employment given in the works themselves that we should look for the improvement which it is necessary to bring.112. A further point of some interest, which may be mentioned in this connection, has been recently stressed by certain com-mentators, .namely, that the Special Areas show a much smaller proportion of their population in gainful employment than the lest of the country. This undoubtedly arises from the concentra-iion in these Areas in the past of work employing mainly male idult labour. Unless such work is highly remunerated, and.this has in fact not been the case&apos; during recent years, the -result i.$. 34182 - b. 4
that the family income and consequently the general standard of living must necessarily be low, since the support of the family is dependent in many cases upon the earnings of one man. The extension of lighter industries to the Special Areas should have the effect of raising the level of the family earnings and so the general standard of life.113. From the facts furnished in the preceding paragraphs, it becomes evident that a persistent effort will be necessary to secure a substantial and lasting improvement in the Special Areas, and that in the meantime it is imperative, in the interests of those living in the Areas, to develop the policy of industrial transference as far as possible, so that the younger inhabitants of the Areas may not be deprived of the opportunity of participating in any further revival of prosperity in the country as a whole.Transference114. During the twelve months December, 1934, to November, 1935 , 21,620 persons were transferred from the Special Areas to employment in other parts of the country under schemes either directly administered by the Ministry of Labour or conducted by voluntary bodies with the aid of grants from the Ministry or from the funds at my disposal. This total included 9,494 men, 4,314 women, 3739 boys* and 4,073 girls*. Fuller particulars are given in Appendix III. In addition, there were no doubt many others who left the Special Areas for employment found for them else-where by friends and relatives or by private registry offices. There is no reliable estimate of this latter group, nor are there any statistics of organised transference from the Special Areas in earlier years which can be compared with those in Appendix III. It is almost certain, however, that in no recent year have so many persons from the Special Areas been assisted to find employment in other parts of the country. The number of juveniles transferred far exceeds that of any previous year, and the number of house-hold removals completed during 1935 was nearly three times the corresponding figure for 1934.115. I dealt with the subject of transference at some length in Part VI of my First Report, and there is no need here to repeat the reasons why I regard it as one of the essential measures for dealing with the problem of unemployment in the Areas. This Report will, I hope, show that I am taking all possible steps within the powers conferred on me by Parliament to revive industry in the Areas bring new industry to them. But it will also show the magnitude of the difficulties to be overcome and the extent to which mechanisation is steadily tending to reduce the number of men employed in the basic industries of the Areas. II is therefore becoming increasingly evident that the dual policy* The figures for boys and girls relate in the main to a period of eleven months only.
advocated in my First Report must be followed and that, while efforts to increase employment in the Areas should be intensified, no opportunity should be lost of enabling the younger persons in the Areas to take advantage of the increasing prosperity of the country as a whole by accepting suitable employment in areas where the demand for labour is steadily improving. I am aware that there is some criticism of this view, but the more I learn of the problems of the Areas the more convinced am I that it is right. There are opponents of transference who are carried away by excess of sentiment and shut their eyes to the hard facts of the situation, and there is a danger that, if they had their way, the benefits of transfer would be denied to thousands of young persons who would be deprived of a fuller, healthier and happier life.116. As stated in my First Report, I have left most of the executive action in the matter of transference in the hands of the Ministry of Labour, which has the necessary machinery and experience. The Ministry have kept me informed of the many developments they have introduced in their transference policy since my appointment. In certain instances I have been able to give financial assistance that has contributed directly to further this policy. I deal fully in Part VI of the present Report with the suggestions made in December for increasing the opportunities available to young persons in the Areas to find employment, mostly in other parts of the country. The effect of transference on the unemployment position in the Special Areas is discussed in paragraph 94 above.PART IIIHEALTHProvision of Health Services117. The provision of adequate health and sanitary services is essential to the welfare of any area, and the absence of such services must hinder its industrial development. Therefore, from the first day of my appointment, I addressed myself to considering the steps which should be taken to improve these services in the Special Areas. Impoverished local authorities had been struggling with varying success to maintain the standard of their essential services, md I soon found that there was much assistance which could usefully be given. The sewerage systems in particular had in too nany cases got into an unsatisfactory condition and become in-efficient. Renovation of sewers is not spectacular work ; it is mostly underground and there is little to show for it outwardly when the tfork is complete. But a good sewerage system is essential to the well-being of any industrialised locality, and in some cases, inch as the Rhondda, the condition of the sewers resulting from absidences was a real menace, causing constant anxiety to the local Medical Officers of Health, and was liable to lead during
any hot&apos;summer to&apos;a serious epidemic. In parts of the &quot;Areas, too, hospital accommodation had fallen sadly behind the demands of the situation, and there were not&apos; enough District &quot;Nurses to meet the legitimate needs of&quot; the population. In all measures taken to improve1 the services of the areas I have had the fullest co-operation of the Ministry of Health, and there is good reason to hope tha: by the&quot; end of11936 much will have been done towards placing them on a more satisfactory&apos;basis.Hospitals provided and maintained by local authorities118; In June last I informed local authorities in the Special Areas that I was prepared to consider proposals for- grants towards capital expenditure for the provision of new, or the extension or alteration of existing, hospitals or out-patient departments, but grants Would not be available in respect of normal works of replace-ment or repair falling within the category of maintenance.119. I was particularly anxious to assist measures being taken to reduce the rate of maternal mortality and to improve the standard of the health of the women resident in the Special Areas. 1 therefore asked authorities, in submitting proposals, to pay par-tieular regard to any need which might be shown to exist for the provision of up-to-date and properly equipped maternity blocks at their hospitals.120: Considerable advantage has been taken of this offer and, during the latter half of the year, I aproved grants towards the cost of nine proposals submitted by six authorities. Details of these schemes are contained in Appendix IV.121. In paragraph 59 of my. First Report particulars were given of an important proposal of the Glamorgan County Council for the construction of a new general hospital&apos;at-an estimated cost of  250,000, and since then a similar proposal has-been received from the.Durham County Council. The Durham scheme is- for the erection of a new General Hospital at Dryburn; at an. estimated cost of  240,000, and provides for 300 beds for medical and.&apos;surgical cases. In both these cases a substantial grant towards the capital cost has been promised.. 122. Fourteen other requests for assistance to local authorities in the provision of i hospital accommodation, of a total estimated cost of some  880,000, are under consideration.Voluntary hospitals [123:. In October last the arrangement: for&apos;&quot;&apos; the&apos; assistance ci I hospitals provided by local authorities were; extended&apos; to embrace m voluntary, hospitals serving the Special Areas, thus: placing &quot;all hospitals&apos;in those Areas in the same position as regards&apos;&apos;-eligibilitj for grants in aid of capital expenditure.   Care is&apos;.taken, mcoa-sidering- proposals, to - secure that overlapping&quot; in - the&apos; provision
services is avoided, and it is confidently hoped that, the measures which have been adopted will have the additional advantage of establishing further co-ordination of the hospital services in the Areas.Seventeen schemes at a total estimated cost of over  480,000 are at present under consideration.Maternity and Child Welfare Centres124. In the.circular issued in June last I intimated that I was prepared to assist approved schemes for the provision by local authorities of new, or the extension of existing, maternity and child welfare centres, where no such accommodation exists or the present accommodation is inadequate. Up to the end of the year grants have been approved in respect of five such schemes and details are included in Appendix IV.Active consideration is at present being given to 14 other schemes, at an estimated total cost of over  60,000.Open Air Nurseries125. An application from the Emergency Open Air Nurseries Committee of the Save the Children Fund for financial assistance in the provision and equipment of Nursery Schools has claimed my sympathetic attention. The Committee have done valuable work in providing Nursery Schools for children from 2 to 5 years of age in areas where there is considerable distress and unemploy-ment, but the number of such Schools established in the Special Areas is small. The object of these Schools is. to give education (adapted to the needs of the children), training in habits, and medical and nursing supervision to young children from homes where the general economic conditions are seriously below the average. While the Board of Education do not make capital grants in aid of the establishment of Nursery Schools by voluntary bodies, they may recognise such Schools for maintenance giants of 50 per cent, on condition that the other half of the. maintenance costs can be met from voluntary sources.126. After careful consideration of the application, and with the concurrence of the Board of Education, I have agreed in suitable cases to make capital grants to the Committee to enable them to extend their work in the Special Areas.District Nursing127. The existence of an efficient Nursing organisation is a valu-able asset in the administration of health services. District Nursing Associations are often called upon to provide assistance to local authorities in connection with midwifery cases under their Maternity and Child Welfare schemes, in the visiting of sick poor under Public Assistance schemes and in attending other cases of acute and in-fectious diseases.
128. No one who is acquainted with the work of District Nurses can fail to appreciate the value of their services. They minister to poor homes afflicted with illness and by their skill and their sympathetic practical assistance enable suffering to be relieved and many diseases to be cured at an earlier stage.129. In paragraph 147 of my First Report I mentioned that help was urgently needed to supplement the local efforts to main-tain existing District Nursing Services, and I intimated that grants had been made by me through the National Council of Social Service to Nursing Associations in South Wales, Durham and Tyneside towards the cost of placing their services on a generally satis-factory footing and of providing for the increased staff necessary to bring their establishments up to the required numbers. In every case it was deemed appropriate that some. proportion of the cost should be raised locally. It was not possible in every case to appoint the additional nurses required as quickly as was originally hoped, but by the end of the year 47 extra nurses had been appointed in the Special Areas of South Wales and 21 additional appoint-ments had been made in Durham and Tyneside. In Cumberland the need for the appointment of additional nurses does not arise but in view of the great difficulty experienced by local Nursing Associations in the West Cumberland Special Area in obtaining funds to enable them to maintain the efficiency of their services I have made giants where help is needed.A list of the places in which the nurses have been appointed is given in Appendix V.Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem; Priory for Wales130. In the summer of 1935 I considered an application for assistance from the Special Areas Fund, made to me on behalf of the Priory for Wales of the Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem. The Order is, of course, a very ancient one, but in its modern form it is principally concerned with first-aid, ambulance work, nursing, etc. on a voluntary basis.131. At the time when I was considering the application for assistance, the St. John&apos;s units in the Special Area in South Wales had a membership of 4,439, of.whom 1,350, or nearly 30 per cent., were unemployed. Most of the unemployed members, and many of the members who were in employment, were without uniforms, and there was also a serious shortage of equipment such as stretchers, surgical haversacks, medicaments, etc.132. Having regard to the valuable services to the community rendered voluntarily by the members of this organisation and to the high social and educational value of the work, particularly in regard to the maintenance of the morale of its members who were unem-ployed, I was anxious to assist the Priory to increase its member-ship and maintain its efficiency. I therefore decided to make a grant of  5,000 towards the cost of making up the deficiencies
min equipment, uniforms, etc., for the units in the South Wales Area, subject to the condition that the expenditure in respect of each such unit should be related to the number of members of the unit who were unemployed..National BMMay Trust Fund133. It will be apparent from what has already been recorded that I have endeavoured in more ways than one to reduce the rate of maternal mortality, which is unfortunately much above the average in certain parts of the Special Areas. This is also the object of the National Birthday Trust Fund, which has done ad-ffiirable work in this direction and in particular has conducted a valuable experiment in the Bhondda to show the effect on maternal mortality of providing necessitous expectant mothers with certain types of foodstuffs for three months before childbirth. At the end of the year I was considering with the organisers of the Fund the possibility of organising similar schemes in certain other parts 01 the Special Areas. I hope to give an account of the arrangements made in my next Report.courses in simple cookery and food value134. Informed opinion has in recent years increasingly called, attention to the need for greater knowledge of the problems of nutrition by the population at large. It is in fact generally admitted that there is considerable need for education in food values, and in the proper method of cooking to secure the best combination of economy and nutrition. Even in homes where there is no lack of quantity of food it is quite common for some essential quality to be absent or insufficient. This point becomes of vital importance in the Special Areas, where it is necessary that the limited family incomes, shall be expended to the best advantage and such, foods consumed as give good. health and, strength. Moreover, the de-yelopment of knowledge of this kind has favourable reactions on the home production of essential foodstuffs, such as milk, eggs and vegetables.135. In paragraph 148 of my First Report I referred to the desirability of providing information and guidance for working class housewives in the choice of food and in its preparation. As indicated in that Report, I invited the assistance for this purpose of the National Federation of Women&apos;s Institutes and the National Council of Social ,Service, and their help was readily forthcoming. It was found mutually convenient to divide the field so that the former body,; which is particularly strong in the rural areas, should become mainly responsible in the County of Durham and the latter body (hi association with the former and with education authorities and other bodies) for the areas of Tyneside and the larger urban eentres in County Durham. West Cumberland and South, Wales, ,
136. Each of the two bodies named has its own method of approach to the problem and at this stage I have thought it well to allow complete freedom for experiment, subject to the ordinary consideration of economical administration and compliance with the terms of the grant.137. The National Federation of Women&apos;s Institutes, through their Durham Federation, organised 27 courses of cookery, con-ducted by three carefully selected and experienced lecturers. Each course consisted of six lectures with practical demonstrations, each lecture lasting about two hours. A course of such lectures was given in 27 different Durham villages. Over 1,350 women attended the lectures, the average attendance being 50. Every person attend-ing was provided with a chart and leaflets classifying foodstuffs under their various nutrition qualities and leaflets containing a number of simple recipes appropriate for the domestic circumstances of the women concerned were available at a nominal charge. Advice was given on the selection and purchase of the foods of the greatest nutritive value within the means of those attending. The in-struotors dealt with cooking on the kinds of stoves which are locally in common use, and fancy dishes and elaborate apparatus were avoided. Reports show that considerable interest among those who attended was aroused in the proper balance of diets and in the value of various forms of food. Arrangements are now being made for a considerable extension of this work, for which it is clear that there is in Durham a satisfactory demand.138. The National Council of Social Service propose for the most part to form the classes as part of the activities of their Women&apos;s Occupational Clubs, and grants have been allocated to area committees and Social Service Councils for this purpose. Classes have been arranged to begin early this year in South Wales and the Tyneside, whilst in Cumberland, with the assistance of the Y.W.C.A., a start has already been made with classes in five places. The Education Committees of the County Councils con-cerned are co-operating in these efforts. It is too early yet to report on the results, but there is every reason to hope that full advantage will be taken of the facilities provided.Physical Culture139. The arrangement of physical culture classes for un-employed men and women is a form Of activity which I regard as very valuable from the point of view of health and maintenance of morale. Classes of this kind have been running for some years in connection with the clubs for the unemployed and much help has been given to the movement by voluntary organisations includ--ing the National Council of Social Service. Part of the grant : made by the Ministry of &apos; Labour to the National Council has been and is being used for this purpose. The Ministry of Labour has also been conducting physical culture activities in the form of
a&apos;limited1 number of &quot; demonstration centres.&quot; In addition, local authorities, assisted by grants&apos; from the Board of Education, have organised physical training classes in certain areas.140. Knowing that these various activities were going on, I pbst-poned taking action in order to study the position. Now I am determined to see that such facilities are made available through-out the Special Areas as will-enable&apos;all unemployed men, who so desire^ to take courses of physical culture. In particular, I trust that those, to whom this kind of activity appeals but who- do not desire to take part&apos;in the occupational and&apos;other work organised by.&quot;the clubs for the unemployed, will respond.141. The enquiries which were necessary to ascertain the extent of the need for the provision of additional facilities and to avoid&apos; duplicating the facilities already provided or assisted from Govern-nient monies took longer than had been hoped.142. Meanwhile, I am glad to report that considerable progress has been made with the planning of additional demonstration centres to be set up on my behalf in the Special Areas, by the Ministry of Labour (see paragraph 257) and also that a considerable extension, of the programme of physical culture classes is to be organised in 1936 by the National Council of Social Service. The Board of Education, too, are formulating plans for the extension of physical training for school-children and young people over school age. I1 hope that as a result of these combined activities there will be a large increase this year in the facilities for physical culture available to- unemployed persons- in the Special Areas.Baths143. Reference was made in paragraph 56 of my First Report to an announcement that schemes for the provision&apos; of open-air swimming baths would be entertained.144. Since that announcement, representations in favour of covered, in preference to open-nir, baths have been made on various occasions! I have given exhaustive consideration to the subject and. have obtained much data concerning the relative merits and costs of the respective types. It seems abundantly dear that, in all parfs of the country, open-air baths provide a most popular feature of healthy outdoor recreation and, oh&apos;this account, they are deserving of every encouragement. On the financial side, the provision of either type of bath generally involves a loss to a local authority, but the initial cost and upkeep of an open-air bath&apos;is much less costly than that of a covered one. Having in mind&apos;the importance of avoiding or reducing as far as possible&apos;the future maintenance costs to local authorities of schemes undertaken - with assistance from the Special Areas Fund, I have, therefore, decided in the main to restrict my approval to baths of the open-air type. The provision of adequate filtration and. sterilisation plants is ah essential condition of my approval,
145. I have approved in principle the construction of eighteen open-air baths in South Wales and hope that a number of these will be built and ready for use this summer. I have also offered assistance towards renovating the public bath at Whitehaven and have several further proposals under consideration.Sanitary ServicesWater Supply.146. The provision of adequate and satisfactory supplies of water for domestic and trade purposes is of primary importance not only from the point of view of safeguarding the health of the population but also as a means of attracting enterprise to areas in need of industrial revival.147. By the Rural Water Supplies Act, 1934, the Minister of Health is authorised to make grants towards the cost of water schemes in rural areas and I am therefore precluded by the terms of the Special Areas Act from assisting rural authorities in the prosecution of such schemes.148. No such embargo operates in nrban areas and, since the date of my First Report, I have been in a position to approve grants towards the cost of proposals submitted by four Borough and Urban District Councils and by four Joint Water Boards. Details of the schemes are given in Appendix IV of this Report,Sewerage and Sewage Disposal149. Modern requirements in matters of sanitation also demand the provision of efficient systems of sewerage and sewage disposal. Apart from the effect on the inhabitants, the absence of such facili-ties acts as a deterrent to the development of populated areas, and every encouragement has therefore been given to local authorities in the Special Areas to submit appropriate proposals either for the enlargement or improvement of existing systems or for the execu-tion of new schemes, where justified. During the last six months no less than 71 applications for assistance in carrying out such work have been received. Bach scheme, to qualify for a grant, has to be shown to be urgently necessary on grounds of public health, and it. seems evident that, had it not been for financial stringency, many of the proposals would have been put in hand by the authorities some time ago; but, with the assistance which I am now able to give, schemes which in spite of their urgency have been laid aside or have been in contemplation awaiting better times are enabled to go forward and thus contribute another step towards the social improvement and economic development of the Special Areas.150. Since the date of my First Report, I have approved no fewer than 73 schemes of this nature at an estimated cost of over  450,000.  Details of these schemes are contained in Appendix IV.
151. Reference was made in paragraphs 62 to 64 of my First Report to three sewerage schemes of considerable magnitude, viz., a suggestion for the unification of the Tyneside sewerage system, the Mid-Glamorgan scheme and a scheme for the Eastern Valleys in Monmouthshire. On each of these there is some progress to report.Tyneside Sewerage152. As regards the Tyneside proposals, a Committee of investiga-tion was appointed in October last consisting of Sir John Robertson, C.M.G., O.B.E., M.D., LED. (Chairman), Dr. J. F. Beale, M.A., L.R.C.P., Sir George W. Humphreys, K.B.E., M.Inst.C.E., and Professor W. W. Jameson, M.D., F.R.C.P., D.P.H., and its terms of reference are as follows :-&quot;To examine and report upon the state of the tidal portion of the River Tyne and advise whether its condition is so in-jurious or dangerous to public health as to require a compre-hensive measure of amelioration &quot;..The Committee have inspected the tidal portion of the River, have conferred with officials of the Tyne Improvement Commission and have taken evidence from representatives of the local authori-ties on the Tyneside. It is anticipated that the Committee will shortly issue a report. On their findings and recommendations will depend the decision as to whether a detailed survey should be undertaken to produce any scheme of improvement in the present arrangements for the discharge of sewage into the River.I am very grateful to the members of this Committee for volun-voluntarily giving their valuable services in this inquiry. The expenses of the Committee are being met from the funds at my disposal.Mid-Glamorgan Scheme153. A report has now been made by a firm of Consulting Engineers upon a proposed trunk sewerage scheme, at an estimated cost of  325,000, for the Bridgend, Maesteg and Ogmore and Garw Urban Districts and a part of the Penybont Rural District. The authorities have not, however, decided whether to proceed with the scheme and they are about to consider a report by financial experts before reaching a definite conclusion in the matter.Eastern Valleys (Monmouthshire) Joint Sewerage Scheme154. In view of the magnitude of the proposals for dealing with the sewerage of this area, I suggested to the Councils concerned that it was essential that a Consulting Engineer should be engaged by them to report upon the possibility of a suitable scheme. The authorities agreed with this suggestion, and a report relative to a proposed scheme, estimated to cost  254,000, was recently pre-pared and forwarded to me.  The suggested scheme provides for the
uconstruction of a main outfall sewer to a single purification works&apos;to replace the existing methods of sewage disposal of the Blaenavon, Pontypool and Cwmbran Urban Districts. Provision is&quot; also made for the necessary subsidiary sewers, and&apos; I am at present awaiting the receipt of certain additional&apos; information&apos; hefore&apos; further&apos; Con-sidering the scheme.Other important schemes of sewerage and drainage&quot;155. Other important schemes, though considerably smaller than either of those mentioned above, have also received may attention and amongst them may be mentioned the following &apos;:- -Benfleldside, Consett and Leadgate Urban DistrictsLanchester Rural District (Medomsley and&apos; Ebchester Parishes)- 156.. Proposals have been submitted for dealing with the sewerage of the above area at an estimated cost of  132,000, but1 the scheme requires modification in some respects and I am now awaiting the submission of revised proposals.Penybont Rural Districts-Sewerage scheme for the parishes of Pyle, Kenfig and Tythegston Higher157. The existing sewerage scheme for these parishes was largely constructed in 1911-1912 but is now quite inadequate to deal&apos;with the flow. It is, therefore, proposed to enlarge the disposal works in the Northern part of the area and to provide a new outfall sewer to replace the existing sewer, which is generally in a bad: condition. In the southern area purification works are to be installed and sewers are also to be laid in an area not connected to the water carriage system, thus enabling the nuisance from the disposal of night soil to be terminated. The scheme is estimated to cost  70,000, and I have approved a grant towards the expenditure.Sunderland County Borough Reconstruction of Roker Gill Sewer158. In this case an existing sewer, which was constructed 70 years ago, serves an area of approximately 400 acres and the con-siderable development which has taken, place and is still proceeding in that particular district - has rendered; the - sewer incapable - of deal-ing with the increased flows reaching it. As a &apos; consequence, flooding now takes place and the position will be aggravated as further development proceeds, unless remedial measures are adopted. I am advised that the construction of the proposed new outfall sewer&quot; will effect the necessary improvement and T have therefore approved of a grant towards&apos;the estimated cost&apos;of  64,335.Rhbndda-Urban District-2Tew main sewer159. As mentioned in paragraph 117 above the condition&apos;of the sewers in&apos;the Pihondda valleys has been for several years;&apos;-a&apos;cause of much&apos;&apos;anxiety, -arid it has-become urgently&apos; necessary&apos; &apos;tb reconstruct
the main sewers throughout the district. The existing sewer, which was constructed more than 40 years ago, has been badly affected by subsidence, causing breakage of joints and fracture of pipes, and, in addition, its capacity is much too small to deal with the flow. Two grants to cover the estimated cost totalling some  93,000 have been approved by me. I visited the Rhondda in December and was pleased to note the good progress made with the scheme and the efficient way in which it is being carried out.Abertillery Urban District Council-Drainage of Old Colliery Tip160. This old colliery tip, deposited about ten years ago, is situated in the centre of the town of Abertillery. Not only is it a great eyesore to inhabitants and visitors, but it is a continual source of danger and nuisance since, in heavy rains, the water rushes down the sides of the tip and causes flooding in the streets around the base. ..    ;The scheme provides for the systematic drainage of the tip, the top of which is to be levelled and enclosed within an iron fence, thus rendering it suitable for a children&apos;s playground. The steep slopes of the tip are to be sown with gorse seeds to bind it. The work is estimated to cost  4,218, towards which I have offered a substantial grant from the Special Areas Fund.PART IV housing the North Eastern Housing Association, Limited161. Reference was made in paragraph 68 of my First Report to arrangements which were in contemplation for the promotion of a Public Utility Society to build houses in the Special Area in the North East in co-operation with local authorities. Such a Society has now been formed under the title of &apos;&apos; The North Eastern Housing Association Limited &quot;., with offices at Metrovick House, Northumberland Road, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The Memorandum and Articles of Association were signed on the, 14th December, 1935. The Chairman,of the Association is the Right Honourable the Viscount Ridley, and the following gentlemen have agreed to serve on the Board : The Right Rev. the Bishop of Jarrow; Mr. W. Leslie Runciman; Captain T. A. Bradford; Mr. Mark Hodgson; and Mr. W. Walker. Mr. Colin Forbes Adam, the District Com-missioner for the Special Areas in Durham and Tyneside, also has a seat on the Board and is at present acting as Vice-Chairman of the Association. These gentlemen are giving their services voluntarily and I am most appreciative of the assistance they are rendering by this public service.
162. The Association, which has been registered as a private company limited by guarantee and not having .a share capital, has been established for the purpose of providing housing aecommoda-tion for members of the working classes in the North Eastern Special Area. It lias power to develop land, to lay down streets and roads and to enter into arrangements with local authorities on the lines contemplated by Section 27 of the Housing Act, 1935.163. The Association is prepared to enter into arrangements with the local authorities in the North Eastern Special Area for the /provision of any re-housing accommodation rendered necessary by action which the authorities propose to take under the Housing Act, 1930, for the clearance of slums, and for the provision of new houses required under the Housing Act, 1935, to meet their obliga-tions to abate overcrowding. Authorities making such arragements will pass on to the Association the annual amount of the appro-priate contribution from the Exchequer under the Housing Acts. At the same time, it is recognised that in order to let the houses at suitable rents it may in some cases be necessary to augment such assistance. I have accordingly agreed to consider favourably applications made by the Association for contributions from the Special Areas Fund, to take the place of, but in no. case to exceed the amount of,- the contribution from the rates which the authori-ties would have been required to make had they themselves built I the houses.164. By these arrangements local authorities who, on account 1 of their impoverished conditions, are unable to bear the strain I of the additional burden involved in the direct provision of large I numbers of houses will be able to meet their obligations in that I respect without any charge upon the rates. All the local authori- I ties in the North Bast Special Area were informed.of these arrange- j mentsin a circular issued by the Association on the 23rd December, I 1935, and signs are not lacking that the Association will perform a much needed service. Already inquiries and overtures have been I made by several local authorities, and it is confidently anticipated I that the Association will shortly be called upon to contract for the k erection of a large number of houses. [Durham Aged Mine Workers&apos; Homes Association ft165- The Durham Aged Mine Workers&apos; Homes Association, I wbichl has often been commended for its good, work&quot;, is supported by I voluntary contributions from mine .owners and miners, and-part 1 of the contributions are applied to the building of small houses for I occupation;, rent-free, by aged mine, workers.16,6. Up to 1930 a considerable number of such houses was built I by the Association entirely from its own resources ; since then 1 the Association has been able to obtain the benefit of an Exchequer I contribution in respect .of some of its schemes. Oliver schemes I have not been eligible for such assistance, and it ;.was -represented I
to me that, without financial help, it would foe difficult for the Association to continue its building policy. In October, 1935, the Association approached me for a contribution in respect of the cost of the erection of 8 houses at Marley Hill in the Urban District of Wickham, for which an Exchequer contribution from other sources was not available. -167. In view of the acute overcrowding problem in the North East, I was of opinion that no opportunity, however small, should be neglected of affording assistance in the provision of additional accommodation to abate the evil, and I was glad to make a grant to the Association of  80 per house.PART VAGRICULTURELand Settlement168. In my First Report I gave reasons for my belief that the question of land settlement must be approached with caution and carefully thought-out experiments made. This policy has been steadily pursued throughout the year, and a programme has been approved which should enable about 2,000 families from the Special Areas to be established on grouped small holdings by the summer of 1937 mostly in groups of about 40 families. Details of the various schemes are given below.169, This policy has been criticised from three angles. Some have said it is altogether too small and fainthearted and that I should have aimed at multiplying the numbers by a hundred. Others have said that the whole effort to settle unemployed miners on the land is foredoomed to failure and should never have been attempted. Others again have advanced the view that the group of 40 is too small, and that the proper economic unit for a group is 400 or 500.170. The first two of these criticisms largely cancel out each other. I am convinced that the experiment should be made and that, if it is conducted with all the skill and care possible, it should succeed. But it would, in my view, foe folly to embark rashly at the present time on any large scale transference of industrial workers to employment on the land; it would upset the economic structure of the country and might well cause more unemployment than it would cure. Moreover, a new problem is being tackled, and it would be unwise to launch very large schemes until the tech-nique has been worked out and further experience gained. Never before in this country has there been a systematic attempt to settle on the land, with the aid of public funds, men who not only have little or no experience of, its cultivation but are not in a position to contribute any of the capital required.   Art experiment ox the
magnitude of settling on the land 2,000 families in two years should be large enough to afford reliable information and guidance Cor future action, but not so large as seriously to interfere with tlie general economic position or, in the improbable event of failure, to involve serious consequences.171. During the last six months two interesting books have been published on this subject; both support my view that it would be most unwise to embark on any large scale plans for settling unem-ployed men. on the land. One.of these books,, entitled &quot; Back to the Land,&quot; was written by Messrs. C. S. Orwin and W. P. Darke, who, after a thorough survey of the position, conclude that the transfer of large numbers of industrial workers to agriculture would depress the agricultural workers&apos; standard of living, contract the market for the produce of, existing growers, add nothing to the demand for manufactured goods and depress the level of prices and thereby the standard of living for all producers.172. The other book is entitled &quot;The Agricultural Dilemma,&quot; and is the. report of an Inquiry organised by Viscount Astor and Mr. Seebohm Rowntree, with a number of distinguished col-laborators. These started their investigations in the hope and belief that the establishment of small holdings might play quite a. considerable part in the solution of.the unemployment problem, and some of those; they consulted held the view that wdrat was being done successfully by a few hundred small holders could be done with equal success by a few hundred thousand. The result of their inquiry, however, was that they were reluctantly driven to the conclusion that the possibilities&apos; of large scale land settle-ment were far smaller than some of the investigators had believed. I commend this interesting book to all who still criticise my policy as being too timorous and restricted.173. Mention should also be made of the recent report made to the Carnegie United Kingdom Trustees by Mr. A. W. Menzies-Jlitchin, of the Cambridge School of Agriculture. Mr. Menzies-Kitchin. had conducted an inquiry to ascertain for the Trustees whether there was a sound economic land settlement policy for this country. His conclusion, &quot; arrived at with great reluctance,&quot; is that a large-scale policy Of land settlement in this country cannot be justified on economic grounds and&apos;can have little influence in solving the problem of unemployment. The Trustees themselves, in a foreword to the Report, while hot agreeing with all the author&apos;s conclusions, express the view that he has given an emphatic answer to those who&apos;believe :that an unlimited number of families can be put on&quot; the land within a comparatively short time.1 :       &apos; .&apos;&apos;   -     1 &quot; &apos;174. The third criticism referred to in paragraph 169 above ve-lates to method rather than to&apos;principle, but, as there are .still many who advocate large settlements of four or five hundred on otie estate, it is perhaps desirable to explain shortly why I prefer the
smaller unit of&apos;forty or fifty. Most of the estates which are being acquired for the purpose of settling unemployed families from the Special&apos; Areas are not in the Areas themselves, and it is in uly view most desirable that the settlers should in course of time steadily merge their life with that of the local community; to effect this,,their children should attend the local schools, and they themselves should attend the local Clubs and social organisations. There is good evidence that this- process is already beginning at Potton which was the first estate to be operated by the Land Settlement Association. But, if 400 families from the North instead of .40 had been moved1 to Potton, it would probably have been necessary to build separate schools and separate clubs for the settlers, and for a generation there might have remained an alien settlement in the heart of Bedfordshire, its occupants..out&apos;of contact and: smypathy with-their neighbours. Moreover,, the question of good order and discipline is of the utmost importance.&apos; However carefully the settlers are selected, a small proportion are bound to prove unsuitable and in the general interests of the settlement have to be weeded out. Unsuitable settlers, who find it difficult to cope with the hard work to be done, become sources of discontent, it is comparatively easy to deal with such in small numbers, but a very different problem is presented in the case of much larger settlements.175. Advocates of large estates claim that they; present better opportunities for processing the product of the.settlement and for marketing on a national scale. I doubt,the validity of this claim. The question is largely a matter of management. The&apos;interests of a number of small estates can be combined for marketing purposes, and this I understand, is to be the policy of the Land Settlement Association.176. Moreover, it is doubtful if it would be possiblento obtain possession of suitable large estates of two or three thousand acres without displacing too much local labour-and seriously interfering with the economic structure of the district.177. As will be seen from the account which follows, I have-not confined experiments in land settlement for the unemployed to any one body or organisation. . As County Councils&apos;and County Boroughs had long possessed powers to provide small holdings, I addressed ,a letter to such authorities in the Special Areas very soon after my appointment, inviting theit co-operation and indicating the help I was prepared to give. County Durham in&apos; particular has been active in settling men on the land, and a few other authorities indicated their willingness to co-operate with me. It was, how-ever, soon apparent that enough could not be done by working through local authorities only, and I therefore entrusted the main work in England to the Land- Settlement Association and decided to establish in Wales an independent organisation, the Welsh Land Settlement Society.   This will be under the direction-of
soeminent leaders of Welsh life and aim at establishing in Wales a number of settlements for families drawn from the Welsh mining valleys.178. I will now proceed to a description of the arrangements that have been made for carrying out the programme of land settle-ment, and give some account of the progress that has been achieved.Arrangements with the Land Settlement Association179. The programme of land settlement on full time holdings which the Land Settlement Association with the aid of grants from the Special Areas Fund is undertaking for the benefit of families living in the Special Areas in England, comprises :(1) 26 Transference Schemes of approximately 40 families each; . (2) a number of schemes within the Special Areas of Cumberland and Northumberland.180. It will be seen, from the paragraphs that follow, that eon-siderable progress has been made in carrying out the first part of the programme, notwithstanding the fact that the task of securing suitable properties is by no means an easy one. For example, it is very desirable that vacant possession of at least a considerable part of any property purchased should be obtained as soon as pos-sible after completion of the purchase. This cannot be effected without additional expense if the property is in the occupation of tenants. Further, the provision of a number of dwelling houses on an Estate gives special importance to such requirements as the existence of good road facilities, water supply, electric light and other services. Such factors as these greatly restrict the field cf choice, and the policy of the Association, with which I am in full agreement, is to avoid selecting Estates which do not satisfy the special conditions that are required.First Transference Programme181. The programme of transference schemes is covered by two separate arrangements with the Land Settlement Association. Early in 1935 the Association agreed to undertake six such schemes of about 40 families each on the basis of one-third of the entire cost (then estimated at about  750 a family) being met from the Special Areas Fund. Two of these schemes are actually in opera-tion, namely (one at Potton in Bedfordshire and the other at Andover in Hampshire. The Potton Estate was a gift to the Association; the Andover Estate was purchased.Potton (Bedfordshire)182. On the Potton Estate of 550 acres, thirty 5-acre market garden holdings have so far been established. Eighteen men were brought down from Durham in March, 1935, and another twelve in July. . Thirty new houses were erected at the contract price of
. 277 per house, the men being lodged in the Central Farm while the houses were being built. As soon as the houses were ready for occupation, the men were joined by their families, and the 30 families are now in residence. All this has meant a large ex-penditure of energy on the part of the Committee and especially of its Chairman, Professor Scott Watson, who has given to this scheme much time, thought and labour.183. The general cropping on each holding of this part of the Estate is as follows: 1J acres of soft fruits. 2 acres of selected vegetables. 1J acres of house, piggery and Dutch Lights. Each tenant will have 100 Dutch Lights andT50 laying birds, as well as 40 bacon pigs twice a year.184. It is intended to lay out 14 more holdings in .1936 to be devoted largely to pigs and poultry. For these holdings a number of additional men will be brought down towards the end of 1936. Two additional market garden holdings can be established as soon as two cottages now occupied by old established tenants become vacant.   The total number of holdings provided will then be 46.185. It is an interesting commentary on the remarks made in paragraph 174 that a number of the new arrivals have already found their place in various social activities in the village com-munity at Potton. Four of the settlers are on the local Committee of the British Legion ; one of the wives is on the Committee of the Women&apos;s Institute; several sing in the village choir, and one man both preaches and plays an instrument in the Salvation Army.186. It was a great pleasure to me to visit Potten a day or two before Christmas and to see the settlers and their children, number-ing in all about 100, at the Christmas Tree Festivities which had been arranged by them. I was much impressed with the quality of the men and their determination to make good in their new surroundings.Andover (Hampshire)187. The Andover Estate, which is the second of the six schemes referred to, comprises 500 acres and is situated two miles from Andover, adjoining the R.A.F. Aerodrome. Possession was not obtained until March, 1935, but a Warden was installed in July and the first men arrived at the end of that month. The Estate is to be utilized for pigs and poultry, the intention being ultimately to provide each settler with a sufficient stock of bacon pigs and laying birds to obtain a livelihood.188. An interesting feature of the scheme is that an experiment is being tried in the erection of the houses by the men themselves. The houses are of frame construction of bungalow type and a few
of them were completed and ready for occupation by - Christmas. Five families1 and fifteen men. without their families were in resi-dence at the end of 1935. One of the settlers was joined by his family in advance of the rest, and it is worth recording that a daughter, 15 years old, obtained work in the local printing works within a week of arrival.189. Considerable work will be needed in connection with the supply of water to the Andover Estate, and early in December the Ministry of Labour opened an Instructional Centre on the Estate to carry out this and similar work. The men engaged on the work are lodged in Andover.Second Transference Programme190. In June, 1935, following the decision recorded in para-graph 102 of my First Report not to proceed with a separate Home-steads Trust, a new arrangement was entered into with the Land Settlement Association whereby the Association agreed to undertake twenty additional transference schemes&apos; of about 40 families each over a period of about two years, the entire cost to be provided from the Special Areas Fund. Towards the fulfilment of this pro-gramme, the Association had acquired the following properties by the end of the year :	Area-AcresFen Dray ton, Cambridgeshire	350Fulney Farm, Spalding, Lines.	122&apos;Howden Aerodrome, E, Yorks.	...      345Goodhall Farm, Ardleigh, Essex   ...	330Lawford Ardleigh, Essex	345Harrowby Hall, Grantham, Lines.	824Cadeby Hall, Leicestershire         ...	...      676Eeynor Farm, Sidlesham, Chichester	290Fletchers and Streetend Farms, Keynor  ...	181191. Some of these properties will accommodate more than 40 families, and it may therefore be said that approximately half the land required for the full programme of 20 schemes has been acquired. In my judgment, this is a very satisfactory result to have achieved in so short a time, bearing in mind the difficulties mentioned in paragraph 180.192. The properties that have been acquired are of varying nature, those at Fen Drayton, Spalding, Ardleigh and Chichester being suit-able for market gardening and horticulture, while the others are more adapted for pig and poultry schemes. Brief particulars of some of them follow.
Ardleigh. and Lawford (Essex)193. The land of these two properties is eminently suitable for fruit growing, and this is to form the main basis of the settlers&apos; income. As little or no return can be expected Under five years, an intermediate system of cropping has been devised to supply the necessary income during this period. A somewhat novel lay-out is being tried. Each settler is to be given four acres of land near his house, while another&quot;two acres is to-be provided in a large central block to be devoted to fruit growing. This arrangement will; facili-tate certain operations, particularly spraying. Breeding stocks of poultry and pigs are being got together; 50 breeding sows are due to arrive early in 1936. Eighteen &quot; trainees &quot; are in residence and 22 more will follow shortly. -;194. Mention may be made of the fact that a letter was received from the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union complaining that men on these Estates had been put out of work as a result of the Association purchasing these Estates. This was a misapprehension, as the men previously employed on the Estates are still being em-ployed on the Central Farms.Fen Drayton (Cambs)195. At Fen Drayton, where market gardening is to be under-taken, prominence is to be given to earlier cultivation, including French gardening, in which the Warden is particularly experienced, Each settler will be provided with approximately 150 laying birds and 40 bacon pigs. At the end of 1935, there were 20 men in residence for training. A contract has been placed for the build-ing of 24 houses at  324 10s. per house.Spalding (Lines.)196. The land on this Estate is of exceptional fertility and the intention is to provide 4-acre holdings and to supply ea,ch-man-with-. 200 Dutch Lights, 40 bacon pigs and 25 head of poultry. The&apos; main type of development will be intensive market gardening. Twelve men have been accommodated temporarily in an Army Hut, and contracts for houses have been placed at  332 10s. per house. ;Howden (Yorks)197. The purchase of the Howden Aerodrome is in the nature of an experiment as the Estate possesses some peculiar features and&apos;) -&quot; moreover, has been neglected for a long period. It may be classed as inferior but potentially,valuable land, which is likely to be suit-able for pig and poultry holdings and should respond to intensive cropping. Development will, however, be deferred until recon- . reconditioning woi*k, especially, drainage, has been carried out. For this purpose the Ministry of Labour intend to set up an Instructional.
Centre. In the meantime, while the process of reconditioning is in progress, equipment is being provided for the fearing of chickens for eventual use on the settlement.Harrowby Hall, G-rantham (Lines.)198. This Estate has been purchased primarily for poultry aud pig holdings and will ultimately provide for 60 to 70 families. Although possession will not be obtained until April, 1936, arrange-ments have been made for the supply of pigs and poultry in readiness-ness for the arrival of the first 20 settlers.199. The following table shows in concise form the number of persons transferred up to the end of the year under the Land Settlement Association^ transference programme, together with the districts from which they came.

These numbers will be increased consider-ably in the course of the next two or three months.200. I should like to pay a warm tribute to the admirable work of the Association and its Chairman, Sir Percy Jackson, and to the able and energetic way in which Mr. Gammans, its Director, and the administrative and professional staff under him have applied themselves to the carrying out of the programme.
Training201. The general policy of the Association has been to appoint a, Warden for each property, as acquired, without waiting for possession, as there is much preparatory work to be done. In the matter of training, the Association is finding by experience that the best policy is to bring the men down in batches of about -20 rather than place the full complement of men immediately on each scheme.   The three main reasons for this are : -(1) the difficulty of training effectively a larger number at one time;(2) the fact that houses are not likely to be completed faster than will accommodate 20 families within four or five months of the arrival of the men, and the desirability of reducing the period of separation to a minimum; and(3) the impossibility of getting together sufficient stock for a larger number of men from reliable sources if, at the end of their training, an adequate livelihood is to be obtained.202. Some idea of the number of poultry and pigs required on a settlement which is eventually to accommodate 40 men may be gathered- from the fact that, on holdings devoted exclusively to poultry and pigs, it is estimated that a man must be in possession of 750 laying birds and roughly 80 bacon pigs in a year if he is to make a living. This will mean the incubation of approximately 100,000 eggs and the building up of a breeding herd of over 300 sows. Stock in these quantities from accredited sources is not easily obtainable.Selection of Settlers203. Some reference to the Association^ method of selecting settlers will be of interest, as this is a matter in regard to which the utmost possible care is essential. Applicants come from two main sources, namely, (1) from Allotment Societies and Group Holdings; and (2) from carefully selected lists prepared by&apos; the Managers of Employment Exchanges. Applicants and their wives are personally interviewed by the Selection Committee, with whom are associated, for this purpose, local people whose advice is found to be of great assistance. Suitable applicants are then visited in their homes by Officers of the Association and a further sifting process takes place. After the men are placed on a scheme, they are normally separated from their families for some months so that it is possible for the Association again to weed out unsatisfactory &quot; trainees &quot; before much expense and trouble have been incurred.I am informed that the Selection Committee is very favourably impressed with the type of men and women coming forward.Local Advisory Committees204. In every instance the Association has set up an Advisory Committee composed of local people, many of whom render valuable
service by reason of the great amount of technical knowledge that they are able to bring to bear on the scheme. In a recent report the Director of the Association, after referring to the somewhat natural suspicion of the countryside regarding these experiments in the realm of land settlement, says: &quot;It is perhaps one of the finest traits in our public life that, in spite of some misgivings, local Committees are prepared to put at the benefit of the Association their gratuitous services and advice.   These Committees are an invaluable link between.. the Association and the countryside, and the weight of ex-perience and knowledge which lies behind them can scarcely . be exaggerated. There is only one example of any real hostility towards a settlement being established, and this was largely fomented by one individual. This hostility has now entirely disappeared, and the natural kindliness of the country-side has shown itself in efforts to make the new settlers feel at home &quot;.205. To my mind this is a very encouraging feature of the work that has been put in hand and one that should be a material factor in its successful accomplishment. A debt of real gratitude is due to these Advisory Committees, and not least to their Chairmen, who have given so much time and thought to a task which involves not only knowledge and sound judgment but patient attention to an immense amount of detail.Settlements within or near the English Special Areas Durham206. In this County the settlement of unemployed men on the land is in the hands of a special Committee of the County Council. My offer to co-operate with the Council by contributing towards the Council&apos;s share of losses on schemes approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and also to provide the men&apos;s working capital met with a quick response, with the result that three schemes pro-promoted by the County Council under the Small Holdings Acts have already been approved. Some particulars of the first two of these schemes will be of interest.Mount Pleasant Scheme207. The Council have purchased 95 acres of land, possession of which was obtained on the 13th May, 1935. The estate, has been sub-divided into 19 holdings of approximately 5 acres each, for the permanent settlement of unemployed men residing in the district. No dwelling houses are being erected, as the men already live in houses adjoining the land.208. During the past six months, the men, who are working communally under a skilled organiser, have been engaged in the work of drainage and fencing, the erection of poultry houses, the
rearing and feeding of chicks, etc. One storehouse and three large poultry houses, each to accommodate 100 hens, have been erected on each holding, and permanent runs are now being, erected around these houses.209. During the months of May, June and July, day-old chicks were supplied ; approximately 7,000 laying pullets are now in stock, and eggs are now being produced in large numbers. These eggs are at present being sold in the immediate neighbourhood, where there is a considerable market. When all birds are in lay, arrange-ments will be made for the disposal of surplus eggs in other dis-tricts. All money received for such sales is being banked, and will be utilised for the purchase of additional stock and equipment in the coming spring.210. A 4-pen piggery of the latest design is now being built on each holding. Expenditure on stock and equipment is being met from a grant paid to the Council out of the Special Areas Fund at the rate of  260 per man. Of this sum, half will be provided as a free grant, and half will be repayable free of interest over a. period of ten years, according to the arrangements described in paragraph 95 of my First Report.Bishop Auckland Area Schemes211. Estates to a total area of 671 acres have been purchased in the Bishop Auckland district, and 65 unemployed men will be settled on 5-acrc holdings, on the same basis as at Mount Pleasant.2121. Dwelling-houses are now being erected, as the men wall be transferred from various parts of the County. The men have already been selected, and the first group were to be transferred during January, 1936, to commence the erection of poultry houses, etc., ready to take delivery of the first chicks in February and March.Factors Essential to Success213. The Director of Agriculture for Durham, whose valuable services in this connection I should like to acknowledge, .points out that care in the selection of men, plus the market for their produce, are the. two main factors essential, to success. The County authorities felt&quot; that it was desirable to ascertain the real aptitude of:the men in a-more thorough way than simply from their know-ledge of allotments Accordingly, selection was made from the group holdings that had been set up in various parts of the County. The type of men selected in this way is of a- very high class. The method is slow, but;highly desirable in order to ensure the best prospects of success, in the interests of&quot; men and scheme alike.214. The second.factor is the market. There is a large market available in the North East, and this has been very carefully studied in order to create in the area the type of holding which
will cater for that local market. The possibilities of further ex-tending the types of holding are being actively investigated in the light of the increased knowledge of the extent of the markets.215. The Durham County Council is considering the purchase of additional estates within its area.Northumberland216. In my First Report, reference was made to the fact that negotiations were in progress whereby the Land Settlement Asso-ciation would undertake a number of schemes in the Tyneside area in association with the Northumberland County Council and the Town Councils of Newcastle and Tynemouth. These negotiations were finally brought to a successful issue, and the Northumberland County Council have made a start by acquiring a farm of 224 acres at Wylam, a little west of Newcastle. Here it is intended to settle 40 families of small holdings of about 5J acres, each provided with a house and small set of buildings. The cost of acquisition and equipment is estimated at  28,850, which will be defrayed by the Council who will raise a loan under the Small Holdings Acts. The Council will receive a grant from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, under the Act of 1926, equal to 75 per cent, of the annual deficiency on the scheme. The Land Settlement Association will take a lease of the equipped property and will sub-let the holdings and be responsible for the oversight of the settlement and for the detailed arrangements in connection with it. The Association will also undertake, on my behalf, to make a contribution to the Council equivalent to one half of the Council&apos;s 25 per cent, share of the loss on the scheme as approved by the Ministry of Agri-culture and Fisheries. The working capital required to establish the men in their holdings after the preliminary period of training will, in due course, be provided out of the Special Areas Fund, partly by loan and partly as a gift.217. The full programme for Northumberland envisages five schemes of 40 families each, or 200 families in all.Cumberland218. In this County, also, a provisional programme of five schemes of 40 families each was agreed upon in consultation with the Laud Settlement Association. In the execution of these schemes it was hoped to secure the co-operation of the County Council in the same way as in Northumberland. After lengthy discussions, the County Council were disposed to co-operate and were actually in treaty for certain properties in the Whitehaven district when, rather unexpectedly, at the beginning of November, they expressed a wish, to withdraw from the arrangement and to leave the entire responsibility to the Land Settlement Association. The regrettably slow progress made in this County is to be attri-buted to special local difficulties, one being the difficulty of finding
properties suitable for land settlement in West Cumberland,:where it was believed that the potential; settlers would wish to-remain. The--Land Settlement Association agreed to carry out the, pro-gramme as arranged, but furtheri consideration led them. to abandon the proposed acquisition of the properties already (mentioned; firstly, because they were not entirely suitable and,-secondly, he-cause out of a number of applicant who were interviewed the majority expressed the wish to move away from West Cumberland and scarcely any were willing to take holdings iri the locality indicated. &apos;-- ;219. It,is unfortunate that successive changes of policy and the inherent difficulties of the situation should have operated to retard the progress of land settlement in Cumberland, but it is -satisfactory to report that, at the close of the. year, the Association were able to negotiate successfully the purchase of a very suitable property known as the Crofton Hall Estate, Thursby, comprising about 784 acres, and situated between Wigton and Carlisle. This.estate should provide about 70 pig and poultry holdings. An influential Committee of local county residents has been formed, and officers of the Land Settlement Association are searching the County for further estates of a suitable description. ..   ;.; ,Land Settlement in Wales220. My offer to co-operate with County Councils in the settle-ment of unemployed men on the land has not yet resulted in any concrete proposals being submitted, but it is understood that the County Councils of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire have schemes in hand to be submitted shortly.The Welsh Land Settlement Society221. In the meantime the work of setting up the Welsh Land Settlement Society (described in my First Report as the Welsh Land Settlement Trust) has proceeded and the following gentlemen have accepted invitations to form the Society&apos;s Council of Management :Mr. E. W. Cemlyn-Jones.Mr. D. M. Evans-Bevan.The Rt. Hon. D. Lloyd George, O.M., M.P. Mr. D. R. Grenfell, C.B.E., M.P. Alderman Arthur Jenkins, M.P. The Lord Merthyr.Mr. Leslie R. Pym. .     .    ;222. I wish to express my appreciation of the public-spirited manner in which these gentlemen have responded to&quot;my invitation. I realise that their task will not be an easy one, but I am very hopeful that, under their direction:, practical and useful results may34182 C
be achieved, to the lasting benefit of those who may be given the chance of making a fresh start in life on the land in Wales.The Chairman of the Council of Management will be Captain Geoffrey Crawshay, the District Commissioner for South Wales.Co-operative Farm at Boverton223. Pending the completion of the necessary formalities in con-nection with the constitution and registration of the Society, active steps have been taken towards the acquisition of land. The first scheme to be undertaken by the Society is to be a co-operative farming experiment on intensive lines, similar to the scheme which has been initiated with marked success on the Fordson Estates at Boreham in Essex. For this purpose I have been able to purchase, on behalf of the Welsh Land Settlement Society, a very suitable property of 650 acres knowan as Boverton Place Farm, Llantwit Major, some little distance south-west of Cardiff. This farm is reputed to be one of the best in South Wales, and I am advised by those who are intimately connected with the Fordson experi-ment that the land at Boverton is admirably suited for intense cultivation, and that the marketing prospects are excellent.224. The scheme of operations at Boverton will proceed in two stages. During the first or development period, which may last from twelve to eighteen months, the Welsh Land Settlement Society will lease the property from me and will carry out the work of Estate equipment, including the provision of a number of new houses, where the employees and future settlers will reside. The houses will be built in the form of a Garden Village. Build-ing operations will proceed during the Spring and Summer, and in the meantime, commencing towards the end of February, a number of men will be brought to Boverton in advance of their families and lodged in the farmhouse, and will undergo the requisite train-ing for work on the land under skilled supervision. A Manager and Assistant Manager have been appointed, and by arrangement with the vendor of the property half the land was taken over on 1st January a month in advance of completion of the purchase-in order that it might be ploughed up for cropping this year. It is anticipated that the houses will be ready in four or five months, when the men will be joined by their families.225. The men. on this estate will, from the outset, be employed by the Society and paid at the county rate of agricultural wages for Glamorgan. Their unemployment allowances will accordingly cease. Some special arrangement, however, will be necessary during the time that they are separated from their families.226. After the initial period of development, and as soon as theland is ready for intensive production, a Co-operative Society will Ibe formed and all employees suitable for permanent employment 1will be entitled to become members.   The property will then be 1eub-leased to the Co-operative Society and the undertaking will I
be conducted on a profit-sharing basis, ail the employee members&apos;] including supervisory staff, being entitled to a share of the profits in proportion to the amount of their wages. The Society Will be financed by means of a loan from the Special Areas Fund for the provision of working capital, which&apos; will be repayable with interest, over a term of years.Other proposals227. In addition to the Co-operative Farm at Boverton, the Welsh Land Settlement Society will, it is hoped, undertake a&quot; number of small holding settlements On similar lines -to those in England, described in previous paragraphs of this Report. The difficulty of obtaining suitable land for such settlements appears to be even greater&apos;in Wales than it is in England,&apos;but energetic steps are being taken to search for suitable land.228. The present intention is that all properties to be developed by the Society shall be acquired by me and leased to the Society! Grants will be made to the Society to cover the cost of develop-ment and working costs, including, in the case of small holdings settlements; the necessary working-capital for the settlers, part&apos;of which, as in the case of the English schemes, will be a loan and part a gift.Group Holdings229. Group holdings, that is to say, plots of quarter to half an acre devoted partly to vegetable production and partly to poultry or pig keeping, fulfil three important functions : (1) They provide a valuable training ground for men who may subsequently be placed on full-time holdings. A number of the men who have been transferred to small holding settle-ments in other parts of the country were recruited from this source.(2) They are of great utility to older men who, because of age, are not likely to be selected for full-time holdings.(3) They are extremely useful in cases where under-employment as well as unemployment is a serious problem.The Group Holdings movement has been considerably extended during the past six months, notably in the South Wales area, where for various reasons it was only possible to make a start last summer.Durham230. In Durham, where the movement has become well estab-lished, there are altogether 47 groups comprising over 900 men. Of these 41 are financed by me and six by the County of Hertford-shire Adoption scheme (see paragraph 376). The places where groups have been established with the aid of grants from the Special Areas Fund are: Annfield Plain (two groups), Belmont, 31182 0 2
Binchester, Bishop Auckland, Bishop Middleham, Broompark, Burnhope, Cornsay, Crook, Dipton, East Jarrow, Eldon, Escomb, Gateshead (two groups), Hamilton Bow, Helmington Row, Murton, New Kyo, Pelton, Rowlands Gill, Sacriston, Sherburn, Sherburn Hill, Snildon (two groups), Shiney Row, South Shields, Spenny-moor, Sunderland (two groups), Thornley, Tow Law, Trimdon Grange, West Hartlepool (two groups), West Stanley, Wheatley Hill, Wingate and Wooley. The groups financed by the Hertford-shire adoption scheme are at Blaydon, Byers Green, Felling, Grange Villa, Page Bank and West Auckland.231. Detailed particulars have been received showing the results realised at a number of centres during the six months ended 31st October, 1935. The figures show considerable variations as between one centre and another, but the general conclusion to be drawn is that the provision of a group holding for an unemployed man undoubtedly enables him not only to provide a useful addition to the supply of food for his family but, with reasonable skill and success, to realise a small amount weekly in cash from the sale of surplus produce.232. The degree of success already attained is such that the County Council, who are in full charge of the work in this County, applied for a grant of a sufficient amount to enable them this year to establish 20 new centres and to extend 36 of the existing centres The estimated cost of this new programme, including expenses of administration, is  15,500. and I have approved a grant of this amount. The inclusive cost of the new schemes is approximated  15 per man and, of this sum,  3 10s. is to be repaid by instal ments commencing in the second year. An interesting1 feature oi this year&apos;s programme is that, instead of being supplied with 40 one-day-old chicks, the men will be supplied with 25 one-day-old pullets. The possibilitv of eliminating- male chicks is quite a recent innovation in this country, and it will be a distinct advantage to the group holders not to have cockerels to fatten for sale a process which yields them little, if any, profit.Northumberland233. In Northumberland the work of promoting the development of group holdings is in charge of the Land Settlement Association. No definite programme has been formulated as the difficulty of securing suitable land within reasonable distance of the large urban centres where unemployment is severe is even more pronounced than in Cumberland. There are at present, however, groups in existence at Walker Dene, Newburn, Lemington, Denton Bank, Coanwood, Haltwhistle and Benton West Farm.The total number of men in these groups is over 100. Some of the men at Walker Dene and Haltwhistle have been chosen for full-time settlements, and several are already undergoing training on the Association^ small holdings estates in Hampshire and Essex.
Cumberland234. In Cumberland the work of promoting the development of group holdings is now also in the hands of the Land Settlement Association. The programme for the County is 500 group holdings, i.e. 30 to 40 groups. At present there are groups at Dearham, Oughterside, Great Broughton and Millom. Part of each holding is cultivated as a market garden, and poultry is kept on the re-mainder of the land. At Oughterside and Great Broughton men have been supplied with pigs in addition. At these two centres, especially, the results are very promising. The extension of the work to the full programme of 500 holdings is governed largely by the difficulty of securing suitable land. Sites for group holding must be within a reasonable distance of the men&apos;s houses, especially if stock is to be kept. Efforts are being made to start groups at Cleator Moor, Whitehaven, Eells and Foxhouses, Seaton, Cockermouth, Maryport and Egremont.Monmouthshire235. In this County the group holding scheme is administered by the existing County Allotments Council. There is therefore direct contact with the Allotments Association, whose members afford the principal recruiting ground for the group holding scheme. The organisation covers also the Special Areas in Breconshire. The Principal of the Agricultural College acts as the Honorary Adminis-trator and he is also President of the Monmouth County Allotments Council.236. Six schemes comprising 98 men have been approved, all being confined to poultry keeping for egg production. Two of these schemes are in operation and the men are getting a small return from their poultry. These schemes are at Twmpath, Nantyglo, Argoed, Gelynos, Glebelands (Bedwas) and Llanfrechfa Upper. Pour other schemes at Pleur-de-Lys, Nantyglo (Top End), Land End (Cwmfelinfach), and Tir Frederick (Cwmfelinfach) are under consideration.Glamorganshire237. The group holding movement in this County started late in the season, on account of the somewhat prolonged negotiations with the County Council. The scheme is administered by the County Council, though a special sub-Committee of the County Agricultural Committee. The County Director of Agriculture acts as Honorary Administrator of the scheme and the technical officers attached to his Department are giving valuable service in con-nection with the promotion and supervision of these groups.238. Thirteen schemes, comprising altogether 198 men, have been approved in this County. In some cases, a number of the group holders are to be supplied with two young pigs instead of poultry.   As the first holdings were started in the late Summer,31182 os
it has been necessary to supply pullets, but it is intended to supply day-old chicks or day-old pullets to the schemes which will com-mence next Spring. As a rule, half the plot is to be cultivated for vegetable growing, the other half being used for the live stock. These, centres are situated at : Hendre, Abertridwr.

Many more groups are in prospect if suitable land can be obtained, but this is a matter of great difficulty. It must, of necessity, be near to where the men live in order that they may attend to their stock properly. Many of the mining villages are high up in the valleys and the only available land is on the neigh-bouring hillsides. Owners of suitable land would be doing a good service if they would make the land available at a reasonable rent.Allotments :240. The cultivation of an allotment by a man who is un-employed may seem a small thing in itself and no one could ever regard it as more than a minor alleviation of some of the worst hardships of his case. But it does provide a healthy occupation for mind and body and the benefit resulting to the man and bis family from the supply of fresh vegetables. I am convinced that it would be difficult to find any other method of doing so much good at so little expense or risk as in assisting the cultivation of allotments. I am, therefore, very glad to know that the Central AUotments Committee, whose resources derived from public sub-prescriptions are supplemented by an equivalent grant from the De-velopment Fund, have again been able during the past year to provide a large number of unemployed or impoverished men with seeds, fertilisers and tools for the cultivation of their plots.   The
actual number assisted last year in England and Wales, was 120,641, or about 3,000 more than in the previous year. Approxi-mately one third of the total number are in the Special Areas: - -1241. It was with the object of helping to extend this good work in the Special Areas that I offered, a year ago, to give financial assistance for opening out new allotments. I hoped that in this way it might be possible to increase the number of allotments in the Special Areas by 10,000, and in my First Report I had to express disappointment at the comparative lack of response to my offer. However, now that the results of the first season&apos;s work are known, it is found that there is an improvement in the position. The total number of allotments cultivated with the aid of grants from the Special Areas Fund, is over 1,600. Practically all of these are in South Wales, where many groups of allotment holders have rented land, either from the Local Allotment Authority or direct from the land owners, and have been given grants to defray the cost of materials for fencing or for the provision of a com-munal hut, the work of erection being done by the men theiry-selves. Detailed reports from the South Wales area indicate that, of the plots available early enough in the season to be cropped this year, at least 90 per cent, have been successfully cultivated.242. Feeling that the fullest advantage had not been taken of the offer made a year ago, I issued a. further letter to the Allotment Authorities in the Special Areas on the 10th September, renewing the offer and urging that they should again take the matter into consideration and examine the possibility of acquiring additional land for allotments, or making available for that purpose land already owned by the Council. What the result of this appeal will be it is impossible at present to foresee.Land Drainage243. At the time when my First Report was issued the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries were awaiting the result of the circular letter sent by them to local authorities in the Special Areas with reference to the establishment of Catchment Boards, to whom grants might be made in accordance with the general policy of the Government under the Land Drainage Act, 1930. Unfortunately, the effective result of the circular has proved very small. Neither in Durham and Tyneside nor in West Cumberland was there any disposition on the part of the local authorities to agree to the creation of a Catchment Board. In South Wales, however, the result has not been entirely unfavourable, and negotiations were proceeding at the end of the year with a view to the establishment of Catchment Boards for certain of the main rivers in that area.244. In view of the failure of the attempt to set up Catchment Boards in the North East and West Cumberland areas, I took up again with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries the ques-tion of making grants to existing local authorities from the Special 34183 0 4
-Areas Fund, and, subject to- the possession of the necessary powers by local authorities to execute the work, I have obtained authority, to make them grants for carrying out land drainage schemes in the Special Areas, provided that the schemes are- outside the area of any Catchment Board, whether existing or in contemplation. It is hoped shortly to issue a circular letter on the subject to the local authorities concerned, which include the respective County Councils, the County and Municipal Boroughs named in Part I of the First Schedule to the Special Areas Act (except Merthyr Tydfil, which is within a Catchment Area) and the Drainage Boards of Morden Carrs and Newbiggin and Billingham, which are the only Drainage Boards in the Special Areas that are outside a Catchment Area. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have undertaken to examine applications for grant and to supervise the carrying out of the work.Afforestation245. In my First Report attention was drawn to the desirability of promoting further schemes of afforestation in or near the Special Areas. Since that report was rendered, I have had further dis-cussions with the Chairman of the Forestry Commission, who has demonstrated in a most practical way the desire of his Commission to render all possible help to the Special Areas.246. In the first place the Forestry Commission made inquiries as to the amount of land suitable for afforestation in or near the Areas. While the total area of uncultivated land is considerable, the area of land suitable for afforestation is restricted by reason of the fact that in many districts the air is smoky, the water content of the soil is often inadequate and the tracts immediately adjoining the industrial districts would be expensive in warding and fire protection. Nevertheless, the Commission are of opinion that it should be possible to plant some 200,000 acres in or within about 15 miles of the Special Areas. This is the maximum pro-gramme which, having regard to the technical and practical difficulties, can be carried out over a period of ten years.247. A programme of this nature would provide employment for an average of 2,000 manual workers yearly and would enable 1,000 families to be settled permanently on the land by the creation of forest workers&apos; holdings. By careful selection, something like 70 per cent, of the manual workers and of the forest holders could be drawn from the unemployed of industrial districts in the Special Areas. The estimated cost of such a programme over ten years is between four and five miilion pounds, of which incidentally about one half would be payable as wages to direct labour.248. I regard this as a most desirable scheme, and on 16th December I made a formal recommendation to the Forestry Com-missioners under -Section 1 (3) (b) of the Special Areas Act that it should be adopted but without prejudice to the Commission^ normal
operations. The additional financial provision for the scheme should in my view be met out of the Forestry Fund rather than that the cost should fall on the Special Areas Fund, and the programme should be carried out by the Forestry Commissioners as the appro-priate Government Department.249. Difficulty is anticipated in acquiring all the necessary land for such a programme by voluntary purchase. I have, therefore, indicated to the Forestry Commission that, should such difficulties arise, I shall be prepared to assist them by exercising the powers of compulsory purchase vested in me by Section 4 of the Special Areas Act and subsequently transferring the land to the Forestry Commissioners.250. It is understood that this proposal was under the considera-tion of the Government at the end of the year. It would assist materially the economic development and social improvement of the Special Areas and afford a considerable amount of employment. Moreover, schemes of afforestation afford opportunity for sound economic investment, since the capital value of 200,000 planted acres would represent a substantial and improving asset.Proposal for Welsh National Park251. I have had under consideration a proposal to establish a National Park in Wales. Briefly, the proposal is to acquire an area of some 15,000 to 25,000 acres of mountain and valley land, adjoining large stretches of mountain country over which it is now possible to walk in delightful surroundings without let or hindrance. The particular area to be acquired would be developed for the use of visitors by the provision of camping sites, a central dining hall and similar amenities, also bungalows and hotels. This might be undertaken, together with the supply of food at cheap rates, by a Public Utility Society not operating for profit. Such a Park would undoubtedly have a wide appeal, not only to ordinary tourists, but to the poorer classes of the community, and is in line with recent developments in the United States of America and in Germany.252. Unfortunately, a suitable tract of country is not to be found actually in the Welsh Special Area, but the scheme would afford a certain amount of employment for persons from the Area, and for its residents it would provide facilities for cheap and healthy holidays. I appreciate that it may be difficult on a strict interpre-tation of the Special Areas Act to justify expenditure on this pro-posal out of the funds at my disposal, but I am convinced that such a Park would appeal to the imagination and would prove to be increasingly attractive to the growing number of persons who are taking open-air holidays, apart from the fact that it would give gratification to all Welshmen and lovers of Wales. An added ad-vantage is that for the expenditure incurred there would be created a national asset which would grow in value. I hope therefore that it may be found possible to establish a National Park of this type,.
Subsistence Production Scheme253. A large experiment, mainly agricultural but partly also industrial in nature, is being carried out In Monmouthshire on the basis of subsistence production with the aid of grants from the Special Areas Fund.   A full description will be found in paragraphs .354 to 360 of this^Eeport.Land Utilization Survey254. My attention was called during the summer to the work being carried out by the Land Utilization Survey of Britain. This body has for some time past been making a careful investigation of the uses to which the land in this country is being put. The in-formation is obtained by local investigators and recorded on six-inch Ordnance Survey maps. From these it is transferred for publication to one-inch maps. The Director of the Land Utilization Survey, Dr. Dudley Stamp, has been good enough to accelerate the preparation of the one-inch maps for the Special Areas, and these have been placed at my disposal. The maps show, in distinctive colour, agricultural land whether arable or grassland; forest and woodland; heath and moorland, commons and rough pasture; orchards, gardens, allotments and nurseries -and land that is built upon or otherwise agriculturally unproductive. The maps afford an interesting picture of the areas under my jurisdiction and will be of considerable value. I should like to acknowledge the courtesy of the Director and his staff in arranging to supply them.PART vi the PROBLEM OF UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG YOUNG PERSONS IN THE SPECIAL AREAS255. An indication was given in my First Report of the great concern I feel about the problem of unemployment among young persons in the Special Areas. Since that Report was rendered, the subject has been under constant consideration and I have had many discussions^ on it with those who are in a position to help. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1934, contains provisions which, if fully applied, would deal adequately with the problem of unem-ployment among young persons from the time they leave school up to the age of 18. There is, however, insufficient provision for these young people after they leave the Junior Instruction Centres at the latter age. Probably the most serious human problem of the Special Areas is that presented by unemployment among, young men between 18 and 21. There are about 11,000 of these, and it is understood that some 7,000 have been unemployed for, more than three months. The problem is, therefore, of manageable propor-tions, but it is one which in my view calls for urgent and drastic treatment. -   -   -
256. Many of these young persons have done practically no work ; they have been brought up in a home where the father has been continuously out of work, and they have little or no conception that a man&apos;s ordinary occupation should be such as will provide the means of subsistence for himself and for his family. They have seen their own families and their friends kept for years by the State, and they have come to accept this as a normal condition of life. It is hardly surprising in the circumstances that young persons with this background and upbringing should be ready victims of all manner of demoralizing influences. In short, these young men present in my view the most tragic aspect of the prob-lem of the Special Areas and one fraught with great danger to the State.257: The first step taken by me was to put forward a proposal on the 24th July last that arrangements should be made for volun-tary physical culture classes for young unemployed men in the Special Areas. There are classes of this type in the Special Areas in Scotland and my colleague, Sir Arthur Rose, reported on them most favourably in his First Report. Such classes do not lead directly to employment, but they help to maintain morale and, if they are conducted efficiently and on modern lines, they are likely to appeal to considerable numbers of unemployed young men in the Areas. I am glad to report that my proposal has been accepted, and that the Ministry of Labour have agreed to establish, on my behalf and at the expense of the Special Areas Fund, over twenty Physical Training Glasses for the unemployed in the Special Areas of England and Wales.258. Necessary as these classes for physical training are, it is even more necessary to provide training or instructional centres which will help these young men to qualify themselves for em-ployment.259. The Government Training Centres, which train men for skilled employment in expanding trades, are already doing much to tackle this problem. I have visited one of these Centres and have nothing but admiration for them. I am glad to learn that the number of these Centres and the number of men passing through them are to be substantially increased.260. Such Centres, however, will never touch a considerable proportion of the population who have neither the initiative nor the intelligence required for skilled employment, and it is among these that there is most unemployment and most demoralization. The Ministry of Labour Instructional Centres are designed, I understand, largely to deal with men of this type, who cannot qualify for admission to the Training Centres. I have also visited one of these Instructional Centres and am satisfied that, whilst their establishment is right in principle, the results obtained are inadequate, since only for a small proportion of the output can employment be found.   Consequently, I made representations to
the Government on the 20th December, urging that there should be a material increase in the proportion of young men recruited from the Special Areas who are placed in employment on completion of a course at one of these Centres. I am glad to know that the Ministry of Labour hope this year to increase the percentage of placings from these Centres, and that my recommendation for still further efforts in this direction is receiving their urgent and sympathetic-thetic consideration. I feel strongly that unemployed men between 18 and 21 of the Special Areas, who have satisfactorily completed a course at an Instructional Centre, should be given some assur-ance of employment for at least one year. Effect could be given to this assurance by the provision of national works such as the construction of arterial roads, preferential employment on which would be given to unemployed men trained at these Centres. Under the schemes now in operation, insufficient employment is found for those who have been trained. The majority drift back home after training and feel that the effort made has been wasted. Despite this discouragement, some offer themselves for retraining but still without finding work. If there is to be hope for these youths, then training must definitely lead to work, and the pro-vision of this is so urgently needed that I feel the institution of the relatively small amount of national work required to be fully warranted.261. As a means of giving a preliminary training and testing to young unemployed men in the Special Areas, I have also recom-mended the establishment in the areas of a number of intermediate non-residential centres which would be open to all young men over the age of 18 and would cater specially for those between 18 and 21. At such centres there should be a fair proportion of-time given to physical training, the remainder being devoted to practical instruc-tion of non-vocational type. An opportunity would be given of testing the ability of the youths, for different types of employment and they should therefore form a useful basis for selection for the Government Training Centres. It should in my view welcome the normal course for boys, after passing out of the Junior Instruction Centre at the age of 18, to be admitted at once to such intermediate centres, if they remain unemployed.262. It is stated in paragraph 255 above that the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1934, are adequate, if fully operated, for dealing with the problem of unemployment under the age of 18. Unfortunately, although Education Authorities have been under a statutory obligation since July, 1934, to establish Junior Instruction Centres wherever there are numbers of un-employed boys and girls, the progress made in some of the Special Areas has been very slow. I have myself visited two such Centres administered by the Durham Education Authority and was much impressed by the tone of the Centres and by the excellent work done. Unless there is an efficient system of Junior Instruction Centres, the rest of my proposals for dealing with this problem
are based on insecure foundations. I regard it, therefore, as most unsatisfactory that, up to the present, not a single Centre has been opened in West Cumberland by the Cumberland Education Authority, although in that area there were on an average through-out 1935 some 1,100 boys and girls registered as. unemployed. In South Wales, also, insufficient progress has been made and I am informed that further or better accommodation is considered to be required for boys in eighteen towns and for girls in seventeen towns. 1 realise the difficulties involved in establishing a widespread system of such Centres rapidly. Premises have to be acquired and staff obtained. Some progress has been made in Glamorganshire since the Act was passed, but it is most regrettable that so little progress has been made in Monmouthshire.263. I have been much impressed by data obtained regarding the low medical standard of boys and young men in the areas. The percentage of rejections on medical grounds for the Juvenile Trans-fer Centres and for the men&apos;s Instructional Centres is alarmingly high. Many boys and young men so rejected could, I believe, be made fit for training and transference if they were given simple medical treatment. It is tragic that boys and young men, made more hopeless by rejection, should be condemned to spend their lives in the Special Areas in the constant fear of unemployment, when some small operation, perhaps to the tonsils, some dental treatment such as the provision of dentures or some treatment of a skin disease could in a few weeks open to them the possibility of obtaining a skilled job offering satisfactory conditions of employ -ment and regular wages in another part of the country. I made a strong recommendation, therefore, on the 20th December, that medical inspection and treatment should be made available for all boys and young men attending all forms of instructional and train-ing centres, and I indicated that, if there was any difficulty in making such provisions, I should regard the cost as a legitimate charge on the Special Areas Fund.264. Most of these recommendations were made towards the end of the past year, as it has been necessary to spend considerable time in exploring the problem. I have since had an opportunity of dis-cussing them with the Minister of Labour and am&apos; assured that they will receive most careful consideration. I hope it may be possible in my next Report to record that considerable progress has been made on the lines suggested.PART VIIVOLUNTARY (LOCAL AMENITIES) SCHEMES265. A short description was given in my First Report (para-graphs 124 to 129) of the assistance given to local bodies of unem-ployed men to enable them to take in hand certain types of work which would not otherwise have been undertaken.   There is now
evidence of a considerable extension of this movement and it deserves a fuller description in this Report.266. In the first place, it should be made clear that I have done nothing which could be regarded as in any way creating an artificial demand for such schemes; indeed, a number had been started before my appointment. Up to-the end of 1935, 75 proposals had been submitted to me, and in every:case the initiative came from the unemployed men themselves. The men felt that, during their enforced idleness, they would like to be occupied on some specific useful work and thus find an outlet for the desire, which should be innate in us all, to produce something practical and satisfying. Moreover, some also saw, in the help I was prepared to offer, an opportunity to remove an ugly feature of their locality and to,create in its.place something that would be not only pleasing to. the eye. but of lasting benefit to themselves, their neighbours, and the community in which they lived. Many of the townships and villages in the Special Areas have lacked any kind of re-creational ground or sports field, and the opportunity to remedy this deficiency has been eagerly grasped by many unemployed men.267. Such motives are praiseworthy. But, without assistance from outside, the men had not the means to give effect to their am-bitions. They could not afford to spoil or wear out their only suits of clothing by rough or dirty work; they could not purchase the tools and equipment that were necessary; they were unable to put up the money to acquire the sites whose appearance they were anxious to improve. I therefore felt fully justified in stepping in and offering the required help to overcome these difficulties1. More-over, I came to the conclusion that men, who were willing to put in hard manual work for six or seven hours a day needed some extra food. I therefore offered to pay for the provision of a good mid-day meal. Further, there was an obvious need for some technical help in most of the schemes, and I therefore appointed technical officers to the staff of each District Commissioner to assist the men in drawing up plans and specifications, to visit the schemes at fre-quent intervals and to give advice on the many practical problems that arise from day to day in connection with work of this descrip-tion. The provision of working clothes and meals is intended merely to ensure that the volunteers are not worse off through giving their services to the schemes.268. During my tours in the Special - Areas T visited many places where these schemes were in operation, and without exception I was impressed by the keenness of the men and their obvious desire to produce something of which they could be legitimately proud, whether it were a football field, a pavilion, a playground, or a paddling pool for the children.269. At first, in a limited number of cases, there was some opposition to&apos; schemes of this type, due to the feeling that.the men would be performing voluntarily services for which they should
have been paid wages. It is satisfactory to record that this attitude has largely subsided, as it has become clear to all that the schemes are initiated by the men themselves and are not such as.I would be prepared to accept for assistance on a wage-paid basis.270. Up to the end of 1935, the grants which I had made to assist these schemes had reached a total of approximately  22,000 and the number of volunteers taking part in them was nearly 2,150. Brief particulars of the schemes assisted are given in Appendix VI, but it will be worth while here giving a fuller description of a few typical schemes.Scheme organised by the Toft Hill, Etherley and District Flaying Fields and Social Service Centre271. A derelict and disused quarry occupied about five acres alongside the main road near the village of Toft Hill, County Durham, and in the absence of any other recreational facilities became the playground for all the children in the neighbourhood. The unguarded precipitous sides and huge mounds of loose rubble resulted in numerous accidents of a more or less serious nature. For a generation no stone had been excavated. In, consequence, the quarry had come to be looked upon by the inhabitants as common land, with the result that it had become the grazing place for goats, and to its derelict appearance was added the ugliness of ramshackle outbuildings, hen runs and pigeon houses.272. The absence of local amenities, and the desire to improve the appearance of the village, inspired a local shopkeeper to inquire whether the land could be acquired at a nominal cost if utilised for this purpose, and the land agent agreed that a body of local Trustees should purchase the land for  5. The land having been acquired, the Trustees obtained the co-operation of about 20 un-employed men and, with only the vaguest of ideas Ss to the ulti-mate result of their effort, they started to level the quarry bottom with a view to constructing a recreation ground. The scheme attracted the attention of a representative of the Board of Education Social Service Association and financial assistance was given by this body. Subsequently, a Social Service Centre was formed and the National Council of Social Service made a grant towards the cost of materials to build a hut. Application for assistance was then made to me.273. I have made grants totalling  516 to provide tools and some materials for the scheme, and working clothes and mid-day meals for the volunteers. Their heavy task, which will occupy in all about 10 months, is being successfully accomplished. A social service centre, consisting of a handsome hall well constructed of blocks of stone excavated from the quarry, is approaching com-pletion, and the surrounding ground is being levelled to provide a football pitch, tennis court, bowling green and well-planned children&apos;s playground.   Three acres have already been levelled and
two acres sown with grass-seed: One hundred volunteers are now working, fifty&quot; at a--time, week and week about.274. In. the course of a few months the village will have amenities which two years ago. would have been considered beyond possibility and, with the completion of the Hall, there is every prospect of success for the Social Service activities which will then take shape.Scheme organised by the Tow Law Social Service Committee275. Tow Law is one of the hardest-hit areas in County Durham and when the Social Service Committee approached my District Commissioner in July, 1935, there was no.public recreation ground of any sort in the district. The local churches had, however, constructed some tennis courts and a grant had been made by the Durham County Community Social Service Council for the erection of a Centre.276. I was approached for assistance to enable the local Com-mittee by voluntary labour to prepare a site for this Centre, to lay out the surrounding ground as a cricket pitch, quoit pitch, bowling green and children&apos;s playground and to fence in the whole. I granted  648 to provide tools and some materials for this purpose and working clothes and mid-day meals for the volunteers.277. The site is a disused ironworks covering three acres. It is honeycombed with old flues, drifts and stone foundations, and when the work commenced the considerable difficulties met with might have damped the ardour of even the keenest enthusiasts for the scheme.278. One hundred and forty volunteers, working seventy at a time,, week and week about, have, achieved wonders. The centre hut is being built of stone from the site, with the assistance and advice of my local technical ^adviser. With the constant, help and guidance of a retired Colliery manager, the scheme is making excellent progress, and will take some eight months to complete. Perhaps it is the most remarkable voluntary effort in County Durham.Scheme organised by the Howden-le-Wear Social Service Committee279. This Committee has organised a number of voluntary (local amenities) schemes in its area. One of these is at Thistleflat, about one.&apos;mile from Crook,/County Durham. . This village was over-shadowed by an- unsightly pitheap and no facilities were available for social activities or services, not even a chapel or school. Most of the menfolk were unemployed.;280. Through the initiative of a local schoolmaster and a Govern-ment official, a meeting of the unemployed was called and every man volunteered to assist in&apos; converting the waste pit-heap into a recreation ground.   A local Committee was formed and the&quot; men
decided to contribute a penny per week each as members of a. Social Service Centre, for the building of which the National Council of Social Service made a grant.281. My local technical adviser then prepared the plans for the recreation ground scheme and I agreed to grant  417 to purchase the site, to provide tools and materials, and to supply working clothes and mid-day meals for the volunteers. The local Council will take over and maintain the recreation ground, when completed. The project is being carried through successfully and it now only remains for grass seed to be sewn in the spring.282. The Social Service hut is also approaching completion, a warden has been appointed and social and occupational activities are already being planned for this and the near-by villages.Scheme organised by the South Hylton Social Service Committee283. Social Service activities in this village near Sunderland began with a Boys&apos; Club, situated in offices which had become vacant owing to industrial depression and were able consequently to be rented at a nominal figure. The success of this Club inspired certain local people of standing to attempt the organisation of a Social Service Centre. With the assistance of the National Council of Social Service, the erection of a hut in close proximity to the Boys&apos; Club was begun. The people of Buislip, Middlesex, became interested in the project. and gave assistance which greatly encouraged the organisers.284. The younger members of the newly-formed Centre then asked if it would not be possible for them to construct a recreation ground, there being no such facilities in the village. The hut was not then ready for occupation and the Centre had therefore no meet-ing place; that this further project should be undertaken in these circumstances speaks volumes for local enthusiasm. With the help of the Ruislip sympathisers, a seven years&apos; lease was taken of a disused foundry, occupying 2J- acres, and 50 unemployed men ahd boys began to level the site, working 6 to 10 hours per day.285. At this stage, my assistance was sought and I granted  500 to provide materials, tools and mid-day meals. With this help, a football ground, tennis courts, bowling green, and bathing pool are being constructed.286. The site was found to be largely covered with concrete foundations several feet deep. Although the manual work was exceedingly strenuous no obstacle, could restrain the enthusiasm of the volunteers.. With the help of a quarry manager,.1 who de-molished the concrete foundations by blasting, the scheme proceeded.2S7. Work on the site commenced in June, 1935, and by November a very fine hut had been erected, the football field had been prepared and sown and work on the bowling green and bathing pool had begun.-. . .....
288. A distressing scene of desolation and decay is steadily being transformed into a pleasing open space, which will provide amenities hitherto absent in the neighbourhood, and the progress is a credit to all concerned. Whist drives, dances and children&apos;s parties are being held and the organisers are confident that the foundations of a successful social service effort have been well and truly laid.Scheme organised by the Glebe Sports Club, Abertillery289. This organisation, although called a sports club, has activities and ambitions covering a much wider range. One of the chief sponsors and Secretary is the Schoolmaster of the Central School and, as there was no playing field, anywhere in this thickly populated area, he and other residents, with the interests of the children and adolescents at heart, conceived the idea of providing one; by voluntary labour. The unemployed in the area readily accepted the suggestion and the scheme to provide, facilities for recreation for the local inhabitants of all ages began in May, 1934. An area of three acres was taken by the Committee on a fifty years&apos; lease at an annual rental of  3. A concert was given by the children of the district to form the nucleus of a fund to acquire and develop the site. Work was begun by 40 men on excavation, with borrowed tools and equipment. Funds, acquired bjT means of donations and a further series of concerts, were spent on equip-ment and fencing. The winter of 1934 saw a temporary cessation of work on account of the exposed position of the site and the lack of shelter for the men. In the spring of 1935 work was resumed and in March application was made to me for a grant to enable the scheme to be completed. At this time voluntary work worth about  200. had been done and  40 had been expended; but the proposals had not been well planned and involved the excavation of hundreds of tons of earth. A new plan was prepared with the assistance of my local technical adviser and a great deal of un-necessary work was thus saved.290. The scheme provides for cricket and football pitches, grass tennis courts, a bowling green and an open area for children. It will occupy about 12 months. I have made a grant of  600 to provide a pavilion, tools, materials, working clothes and mid-day meals.Scheme organised by the Rifle Green &amp; District Recreation Club, Blaenavon291. This District has always been well-known for the prowess of its inhabitants in sport and, up to 1923, was provided with playing fields. The land was then sold for housing. During the coal industry stoppage of 1926, the need for a playing field prompted many men in the district to endeavour, while idle, to provide one for themselves. The only available site was the rubbish-tip of a disused mine, with a flat space on the top about forty yards by
thirty yards and not a blade of grass. The lessees of the site offered no objection and the work began, the skips and rails being-borrowed from the colliery and the miners bringing their own tools. Work proceeded until the termination of the stoppage, but the return to work in the mines retarded progress and the skips and rails had to be returned to the colliery. The unemployed, however, carried on as best they could and many of the men who had returned to work continued to assist for a couple of hours a day after finishing their work in the mine. Industrial depression was now setting in, and the number of unemployed was increasing. Thus the number of volunteers also increased, but work was hampered by lack of equipment. Home-made wheelbarrows, boxes-on-wheels and hand trucks were the only means of conveying and dumping the excavated material. Nevertheless, by 1930, thousands of tons of rubbish had been removed and an area just large enough for a playing pitch had been cleared. During the whole of this period, efforts were being made by the Committee to provide funds by subscriptions, donations, and the holding of popular concerts with the prices of admission 3d. and 6d. At this stage, it was necessary to obtain about 350 loads of ashes to spread over the site prior to laying the turf and, as haulage of this to the site had to be paid for, it practically exhausted their resources. Permission was obtained to raise turf on the mountain and this again was hauled to the site on hand carts and the actual playing pitch was laid early in 1934. The pitch was, however, so short that at the one end the ball had often to be retrieved from the botton of the tip. At this point, the interest of Captain Crawshay, then Hon. Secre-tary of the Playing Fields Association for Monmouthshire and now my District Commissioner for South Wales, was secured in an endeavour to obtain some financial assistance to complete and fence the ground. There was no security of tenure of the site but the. freehold of 3J acres was obtained from the Estate of the Marquis of Abergavenny, as a gift, except for the legal transfer costs. A grant of  500 from the Playing Fields Association was promised, subject to the local authority also becoming interested and appointing trustees for future maintenance. The substantial gift of this land had enabled the scheme to be extended to cover much more than a playing field, and application was made to me for a grant to complete the scheme.292. The efforts of my District Commissioner eventually removed all the obstacles and the work is now proceeding on the enlarge-ment of the playing pitch and the clearance of another portion of the tip.to make up two hard tennis courts. In the Northern portion a site of about lij acres is being levelled, drained, and fenched off1 at ajiigher level, about six feet above that of the original section, and this will be equipped with all the facilities necessary for a complete children&apos;s playing field. The cost of the equipment and of the fencing is being provided by the grant of the Playing1 Fields
Association and my grant of  955 is being applied to all the other 1 necessary works, which it is estimated will occupy the voluntary I services of 40 men for a period of 12 months. ,Scheme organised by the Ynyswen Social &amp; Recreational Club293. Ynyswen; situated midway between the two townships of f Treorchy and Treherbert, up to 1931 had no facilities for recreation 1 for its young people.   In that year, a meeting for young men was 1 called, sponsored by one of the local Councillors, and it was decided 1 to make some effort to meet local requirements and to provide an interest for the young unemployed men.   A disused refuse tip was rented and made available for games, football, cricket and hockey.  I The district was canvassed and practically every household agreed  1 to contribute one penny per week; concerts and special efforts were I made; and a fund of  24 was accumulated.   A desire was then I expressed to make provision for indoor recreation as, up to this I time, all the meetings were being held in a public house and there  I was no other place to which the men could resort in wet weather. A site was available in the main street, the property of the local authority, who readily agreed to let it on a lease at  4 per annum, To obtain a building was the next ambition of the Committee.  A suitable one was found at a cost of  85,  45 of which was to be paid   I at once and the balance by monthly instalments.   Through the   I kindly efforts of a few local enthusiasts, interested in the welfare   I of the young people, and the sympathy of the Manager of a local   I bank, an overdraft of  85 was arranged, with which to pay for the If building, and the organisers&apos; own fund was utilised for removal and H re-erection.   This was done by volunteers and, for over a month, Ef -these young men worked on the site, sleeping in the building they If were demolishing.   They numbered and marked each part for re- H erection with the least possible damage and delay.   Four months m from that time the&apos; building was re-erected on the new site and i; opened to the inhabitants, all the work having been completed by I the voluntary workers.   The burden of debt, through the provision H of indoor games, piano, and the necessary furniture, had swollen fc to  130 in 1932.   This was gradually reduced by the pennies of HJ the unemployed to less than  30.   The building was&quot; repainted and HE many other amenities acquired. [294. The site on which the building was placed was sufficiently H large to provide outdoor sport facilities, and application was made to Ep me for a grant to enable tennis courts, a putting green and ::. B-. children&apos;s playground and paddling pool to be constructed. IHJ granted  408 to provide a shelter, tools and materials for this H purpose and working clothes and mid-day meals for the volunteers, HI295. The work, which will take 4 months, is being carried out HJ in a most workmanlike manner and with the whole-hearted co- Hj operation of all the members. Great assistance is also being given HJ by the Surveyor of the local authority and his staff to this praise- HJ worthy effort. H
Scheme organised by the Forge Side Welfare Association, Blaenavon296. Most of the houses in this outlying area are built around an old iron and steel works and, as the result of the children playing near the railway sidings and machinery, numerous accidents have occurred, several of which have proved fatal. Most of the in-habitants were formerly steel workers and have experienced long-periods of unemployment.297. The Association was established in 1927 to provide facilities for social recreation for the 1,600 inhabitants, including a place where the children could play. The Miners&apos; Welfare Fund made a grant for the erection of a recreational hall for the village, and all the labour necessary for the preparation of the site and excavations for foundations was voluntary.298. A playing field was a long-felt want and the men decided to rent an area of land to provide playing facilities for the children and possibly later for the adults. Sufficient men soon volunteered for the work and a start was made on 3J acres of rough mountain land in the summer of 1933. The site was such that excavations of a depth of 12 to 14 feet were necessary, and the ground such heavy clay that explosives were used to loosen it. The ^Society of Friends became interested in the scheme and for ten weeks valuable services were given by a batch of 30 International Students. The work continued intermittently but, on account of the lack of tools and materials and the wear and tear on boots and apparel, progress was very slow.299. About half the necessary excavations and filling had been accomplished when application was made to me in March, 1935, for a grant to complete the work and fence the site. It was necessary to secure a lease, or some better tenure than a yearly tenancy, so as to justify a grant and to ensure that the result of the voluntary labour should not be abortive. This difficulty was overcome by my District Commissioner and I made a grant of  989 15s. to provide a hut, tools, materials, working clothes and mid-day meals. It is estimated that the scheme will take 15 months to complete with the services of 40 voluntary workers.PART VIIIOTHER MEASURES OP SOCIAL IMPROVEMENTSocial ServiceValue of Voluntary Social Service Work300. In my First Report a description is given of the steps taken to assist the development of many forms of social service in the Special Areas, and the reasons are stated why I decided, in the main, to concentrate grants for such work through the National
Council of Social Service. All the evidence received during the last six. months confirms the conviction that voluntary bodies are doing magnificent work in the Special Areas but that owing to the impoverished state of the areas financial assistance on a substantial scale is necessary if that work is to have full effect. It is gratifying that financial support on behalf of the Government can be given to this admirable work, often hampered by lack of means. It is carried -on without thought of honour or reward by thousands of voluntary workers, and is deserving of support. This is a class of work which does not readily lend itself to bureaucratic administration, at any rate in this country. Voluntary service for those less fortunately placed is one of the great British traditions, and that tradition has never found a truer expression than in the manifold services now being rendered under the lead and inspiration of our present King among the unemployed in the Special Areas.301. It should be stated frankly that I regard the development of Social Service as of great value to the Special Areas. As pointed out in my First Report, there will remain in these Areas for years the necessity for a continued and determined effort to maintain the morale of the unemployed where good and improve it where in-different. Whilst industrial development of the Areas is clearly of primary importance, it is unfortunately a slow process. In the meantime, there are thousands of persons living in the Areas who are unable owing to economic causes to satisfy the natural- and proper wish of every self-respecting citizen to earn the wherewithal to feed and clothe himself and his family. As the recent report of the Unemployment Committee of the National Council of Social Service aptly remarks, &quot; unemployment damages the. mind and spirit more than the bbdy-r It cuts its victims off from the normal life of their fellows, torments them with a consciousness of frustra-tion, undermines their self respect. It is the task of the whole community to combat that evil; and to ensure that those who cannot get work shall nevertheless be enabled to use their time and talents, if they so desire, in the development and useful employment of their own powers &quot;.302. It has been a great privilege to be able to. assist this work. The Ministry of Labour was already helping the National Council of Social Service to develop its work for unemployed men, but I have been able to supplement that- in certain directions and to give considerable help to work among women, adolescents a,nd school children. The results have amply justified the expenditure. A further quotation from the report of the National Council &apos;s Unem-ployment Committee is appropriate. &quot; The additional work in the Special Areas &quot;, it says,&quot; is largely due to the great impetus given to voluntary effort by the Commissioner^ grants; but, like all other work recorded in this Report, its success depends ultimately on the enterprise shown by the voluntary organisations that are responsible for the development of different activities and by the energy with which-the local communities use their new opportunities.   Already
a great deal of fresh activity has been set on foot, and many on whose work poverty had laid a restraining hand are going forward with new assurance and new courage born of the help which the Commissioner has given through the National Council &apos;&apos;.303. The grants made to the National Council of Social Service have permeated to the Special Areas through many channels, and must have reached hundreds of different communities. I asked for no publicity of the source of the grants, and frequently their source was unknown to the recipient body. The important thing is that useful work in a number of directions has been stimulated, and there is good reason to believe that the homes of many thousands in the Special Areas have been made the happier thereby.304. Particulars of the grants allocated to the National Council of Social Service up to 31st March, 1936, are as follows :  School camps for boys and girls ...       ...      ...      75,000Occupational centres and holidays for women ...      12,500Capital grants for occupational centres for men 6,080Social Settlements ...       ......       ......      12,000Social centres for adolescents    ...      ...      ...      40,000Lecture   Courses,   Choral   Societies,   Drama      12,500 Groups.Provision of additional District Nurses (see para-      22,000 graph 129).A further grant of  100,000 has been provisionally approved in respect of school camps in the year ending on 31st March, 1937.Social Settlements305. I referred in my First Report to the value of Social Settle-ments. They have been aptly described as local &quot; power houses &quot; for which new ideas and energy radiate. They are centres to which clubs for the unemployed and boys&apos; and girls&apos; organisations may turn for guidance and help, and places where meetings can be held for the discussion of common interests. It is well known that Social and Educational Settlements, not merely those in the Special Areas, are playing an important part in the development of social life in the districts they serve. In the Special Areas their activities have been of very great value as they have been largely responsible for helping groups in their neighbourhoods to develop centres and clubs for unemployed persons and for the stimulation of other forms of Educational work and Community life.306. Each settlement is affiliated either to the Educational Settle-ments Association or to the British Association of Residential Settle-ments, and is thus able to draw on many forms of skilled advice from the central bodies. But, like many other voluntary efforts in the Special Areas, their work has outgrown their means.
307. Grants have been made from the Special Areas Fund to enable the work of existing settlements to be extended. Main tenance grants have been made to the Settlements at Trealaw (Bhondda), Merthyr Tydfil, Bargoed, Risca, Pontypool and Durham, and grants in respect of additional buildings at Pontypool Dowlais, Aberdare, and Seaham Harbour. I am informed that there is need for the establishment of additional settlements in districts which have not hitherto been touched, and this need is being further examined.308. The grants for maintenance have enabled the settlements so assisted to provide more effectively the expert guidance in handi-crafts, physical training, music and the drama required by the unemployed clubs and centres which lie within the field of. their influence, while the grants for buildings will lead to much-needed expansion of activity.309. Thus the Bargoed Educational Settlement whose area, ex-tending for 17 miles down the Rhymney Valley and having a popula-tion of 130,000 in nearly 30 villages, has 23 clubs for men, 13 for women and four for girls, has been enabled by my grant to appoint a Men&apos;s Club Organiser, a Women&apos;s Club Organiser, a Girls&apos; Club Organiser, an Education Officer, a Craft Instructor, a Gymnastic Instructor and a Secretary Typist.310. The Pontypool Educational Settlement in the Eastern Valley of Monmouth, as the result of the extra skilled assistance which has been made available, reports that the scope of its work and the sphere of its influence are growing far more rapidly now than at any other period and that the Settlement is becoming an integral part of the life of the people. This is happening because members of the Settlement Staff are to be found almost every day in the various clubs and centres.,311. The Oxford House Educational Settlement at Risca, in the Western Valley of Monmouth, has been enabled by my grant to engage a Craft and a Physical Training Instructor and has obtained the full-time services of an existing Boys&apos; Club Leader. Greater effort is now possible on behalf of the people outside Risca, and there are now nine unemployed clubs looking to the Settlement for guidance.312.: The Merthyr Settlement, which serves the Vale of this name, reports a very considerable expansion of the Settlement work and in the associated Clubs. Appointments, of additional staff, made possible by my grant, include an Education Officer, a Physical Training Instructor, a Woman Graft Instructor and a Girls&apos; Club Leader.,813. Maes-yr-Haf Educational Settlement at Trealaw, in the Rhondda. Valley, affords guidance and help to 30 Men&apos;s Clubs and 19 Women&apos;s Clubs in the Rhondda, and now employs the full-time services of two Physical Training Instructors.   A Boys&apos; Club
Leader and a temporary Handicraft Instructor have been added to the staff. There are now three Tutors or Education Officers and a full-time Music Organiser. The assistance given from my grant for purposes of motor transport, which is an essential service in this large area, is reported as specially valuable.314. Rock House Educational Settlement at Seaham H&amp;rbour has, with the help of a grant, built a new hall which will permit of the development of Music, Women&apos;s Work, Drama groups, and Craft work.Unemployed Men315. The necessary assistance for occupational clubs and centres for men is found in the main from the grant made by the Ministry of Labour to the National Council of Social Service, whose activities on behalf of unemployed men include not only the Special Areas but any parts of the Country suffering from severe and prolonged unemployment. It was, however, represented to me that, in certain of the centres in the Special Areas, some additional assistance was required as the need for adequate premises could not be sufficiently met out of the existing provision. Accordingly, I agreed to make specific grants in respect of land and buildings where the numbers to be accommodated were high and where the need for an occupational Centre was such as to justify the purchase or adaptation of premises of a more permanent character. In agree-ment with the Ministry of Labour and the National Council, I have approved capital grants under this heading in order that the unemployment work of the following organisations may be more suitably housed : Annfield Plain Social Service Centre, Page Bank Village Centre, Sunderland Unemployed Social Club, Gateshead (Gladstone Terrace) Institute for Unemployed, Newcastle-on-Tyne (West Street) Unemployed Occupational Centre, all in the North East area; Maesteg Unemployed and Social Service Club, Trealaw (Don) Unemployed Social and Handicraft Club, Mardy Unem-ployed Social Club, Tonypandy Unemployed Club and Ferndale Unemployed New Social Centre, all in South Wales.316. I have also made a capital grant for the purchase and adaptation of a house in which the increased staff and activities of the Community Service Council for County Durham may be more suitably accommodated.Women317. In my First Report I referred to the strain imposed on the women, especially the house-wives, by the unemployment of their men-folk, by the necessity for making ends meet on a reduced income, and their endeavours to maintain a cheerful demanour in the family circle. Brief reference was also made to the grant-aid which had been provided through the National Council of Social Service to various bodies and associations for the development of social service among the women in the Special Areas.
318. At the end of the first year of activity it is possible to give some particulars of these enterprises and to indicate the encouraging-ing results which have been achieved at relatively small cost.319. With the help of this grant the number of Women&apos;s Occu-national Clubs has been substantially increased, handicraft teaching has been improved and increased, and musical and. dramatic activities have grown. Practical guidance has been given in such household tasks as the making and renovation of simple upholstery, the execution of household repairs and in dressmaking. The social value of holidays for working housewives has been amply demon-demonstrated. As evidence of the successful approach by the organisa-tions, and of the ready response on the part of the women them-selves, the following particulars supplied by the National Council are worthy of record.Southi Wales320. The South Wales Council of Social Service has been able to develop its Women&apos;s Work to a remarkable extent. The number of Clubs in the area has grown from 63 at the end of February to 109 at the beginning of December. This rapid development of new Clubs has been parallelled by a steady improvement in their standard of work and range of activities. Nearly all the Clubs in South Wales now have regular sewing and handicraft classes taken by qualified teachers, and the interest in this type of work has been so keen that special Craft Schools have been arranged in various parts of the area to provide more advanced teaching for selected members of groups of neighbouring Clubs. Various musical and dramatic activities have been started in many of the Women&apos;s Clubs, and in a few places plays written by the members themselves have been acted. During the Autumn, courses of &quot; Keep Fit &quot; instruction were held in 28 places, and were so successful that three additional &apos;&apos; Keep Fit &apos;&apos; Instructresses were to be appointed in January to extend this work over a wider area. This rapid development of Women&apos;s work has necessitated a corresponding increase in the staff of the South Wales Council. Every effort is being made to enlist voluntary service where this is available to follow up and supplement the work of paid teachers, but unfortunately in many of the isolated districts, where help is most needed, there are no local people with either the leisure or the organising experience necessary for Club leadership. The following new appointments have accordingly been made : 2 Assistant Club Organisers, 3 Handicraft Teachers, 1 Homecrafts Organiser, 1 Physical Training Organiser and 3 Physical Training Instructresses.Tyneside321. There are now 25 Women&apos;s Clubs under the auspices of the Tyneside Council of Social Services, nine of these having been opened during the year.   All these Clubs are having regular courses
of instruction in one or more of such handicrafts as dressmaking and renovations, simple upholstery, rug-making, millinery and weaving. Two Drama groups have recently been formed, and physical training is being developed wherever qualified teachers and suitable premises are available. The shortage of premises has hitherto been a serious handicap to the extension of Women&apos;s Work in many of the Tyneside towns, but, wherever Club buildings are being erected or converted with grants from the Special Areas Fund, provision is now being made for the needs of Women&apos;s sections. Already four Women&apos;s Clubs have their own permanent rooms, which are always available to- members, either for classes or social functions, or for rest and recreation.322. The Tyneside Council has recently appointed two additional workers to assist their Senior Woman Organiser, and a number of part-time teachers are now employed by the Council to take classes in subjects for which local Education Authority&apos;s Instructors are not available.Durham323. There has been a rapid growth of Women&apos;? work under the Community Service Council for County Durham since grants from the Special Areas Fund became available. There are now some 30 Women&apos;s Clubs in. the County, as compared with 10 at the end of 1934, and contacts have been made in a number of other places where new Clubs will be opened during the next few months. Two Women Organisers have been appointed since March, 1935, and qualified local teachers are being employed to give instruction in sewing and handicrafts, for which there is a keen demand.324. An interesting experiment has been the appointment of a Woman Organiser to develop Dramatic work. This Organiser, who went up to Durham in October, has been working mainly in Women&apos;s Clubs, but has already formed joint Dramatic groups of both men and women in five places. These groups are pre-paring short plays or variety entertainments which they hope to produce before the end of the Winter. The costumes, scenery and furniture needed for the productions will be made in the Clubs, and will give interesting occupation to a gTeat many members apart from those who are actually taking part in the performances.325. The Durham Community Council has recently acquired the lease of &quot; The Fields &quot;, Etherley, near Bishop Auckland. This house will be used during about 9 months of the year as a Women&apos;s Holiday Centre, and at other times will be available for Con-ferences, Training Courses, and Craft Schools for Club workers in various parts of the County.
West Cumberland326. Grants have been made to the Cumberland Friends&apos; Unem-ployment Committee in support of their work on behalf of women, which includes the provision of holidays, the equipment in 9 Clubs, the transport of members of isolated Clubs attending joint educa-tional classes, and the salary and expenses of a Handicrafts Teacher to work in Women&apos;s Clubs.327. Grants have been made to the Y.W.C.A. in connection with their work for women in West Cumberland, including the provision of holidays for women, and the salary and expenses of a Handicrafts Teacher who is working in five Women&apos;s Clubs under the auspices of the Y.W.C.A. in Whitehaven, Kells, Workington, Maryport, and Millom.328. Among other bodies who have administered grants for women&apos;s work are the- National Union of Townswomen&apos;s Guilds in connection with the formation of Guilds in the Special Areas, and the National Council of Girls&apos; Clubs to enable women from the Special Areas to attend short courses in Physical Training which were held at Easter and during the Summer.The Beeches Education Centre (Warwickshire)329. During the year, 146 women from Clubs within the&apos; Special Areas attended courses at The Beeches. Of these, 114 came from South Wales, 16 from County Durham, 12 from West Cumberland and 4 from Tyneside. A capital grant of  1,500 was made from the Special Areas Fund towards the cost of building an extension at The Beeches so as to meet the growing demand from Cfubs in the Special Areas. Previously, the house had been able to accommo-date twenty resident students, and the new wing will give accom-modation for ten additional residents in each course, which is approximately equal to an increase of 1601 in a year.Holidays for Women330. Part of the total grant made for social work amongst women was to be available for the provision of holidays for women who were sadly in need of a rest and a change of scene but were unable to afford the expense of a holiday. With the aid given, 2,240 women drawn from all parts of the Special Areas have been enabled to go away for holidays of a week or a fortnight&apos;s duration. In South Wales the arrangements were organised by the South Wales and Monmouthshire Council of Social Service, in the North East by the Community Service Council for County&apos; Durham and the Tyneside Council of Social Service, and in Cumberland by the Cumberland Friends&apos; Unemployment Committee and the West Cumberland Y.W.C.A. In some cases use was made of the children&apos;s camps (see paragraphs 337 to 343) during the month of
August, when the educational staff were on their holidays and the camps were not being used by the children. In others, the women went to Holiday Homes at Scarborough and other seaside places, whilst two very popular guest houses were at Dungeon Ghyll in the (Dalce District and Alston on the moors between Carlisle and Hexham.331. There is no doubt that this work has been deeply appreciated and has done a great deal of good. Some of the women had never before had a holiday, nor even left their homes for a single day. It is easy to imagine how much rest and benefit were derived from this complete change of scene and respite from unending domestic work and responsibility. I feel convinced that the expense involved and trouble taken by the organisers have been well worth while, and I propose to continue the grant on similar lines in the current year.Adolescent Boys and Girls332. In my First Report (paragraphs 133, 136 and 137) it was stated that a grant of  30,000 had been allocated to the National Council of Social Service for the restoration and stimulation of social work among adolescent boys and girls; that the National Council had distributed this grant, to be applied in the Special Areas, to a number of appropriate and well-established national bodies; and that it was anticipated that the chief uses to which the grant would be put would be the appointment of additional personnel, the renewal of worn-out equipment, the provision of suitable premises and the promotion of camping holidays.333. Owing to the long continued industrial depression, which was reflected in a lack of funds for the extension of these services, their development for some years past had been greatly restricted, but during 1935 a great step forward has been possible and satisfactory progress made towards overtaking the arrears. But there still remains much to be done. Indeed, I recently decided to increase the amount of this grant to the National Council by  10,000 to  40,000, this being in respect of the period of fifteen months ending on 31st March, 1936.334. The National Council, to whom I gave considerable dis-cretion in the allocation of the grant provided that it was devoted to social work for adolescents and restricted to the Special Areas, has continued to distribute this grant mainly, though not ex-elusiyely, through the national organisations concerned with this work, to whom, in its turn the National Council has given a com-paratively free hand within the prescribed limits. The organisations who have collaborated in the work include the Y.W.C.A., Girls&apos; Life Brigade, National Council of Girls&apos; Clubs, Girl Guides Association, National Association of Boys&apos; Clubs, Y.M.C.A., Boys&apos; Brigade, Church Lads&apos;  Brigade, Boy  Scouts&apos;  Association and
Welsh League of Youth, and the grants have in the main been expended on contributions towards the cost of additional organisers, the provision of additional and the improvement of existing pre-mises, the supply of kits, uniforms and camping equipment and the grant of assistance towards expenses in camp of those members of the organisations concerned who would otherwise have been unable to attend.335. The advantages gained from this expenditure have been widespread throughout all three Special Areas. A great campaign for starting new branches in towns and villages hitherto untouched and for enlisting new members of all the organisations has been launched with most encouraging results. The enthusiastic reports which have been received from the local leaders and organisers form a glowing tribute to the value of these grants.336. An account of the actual services carried out by the various organisations, with the aid of my grant, is given in Appendix VII.Children&apos;s School Camps337. In my First Report I outlined a scheme for the provision of school camps which, at that date, was but partly completed. I am now in a position to report the results of experience in these camps during the Summer of 1935 and to outline the arrangements which have been made for a limited use of certain camps during the Winter of 1935-1936. The National Council of Social Service undertook the responsibility for organising these Camps and they were warmly supported by the Board of Education, the local Educa-tion Authorities and their school teachers, the Y.M.C.A., and other voluntary associations, whose experience and co-operation have proved of the greatest value. In the result, nearly 20,000 school boys and girls and teachers were accommodated at eleven camps during the months of May, June, July and September of 1935.338. Selection of children was made by the local Education Authorities, but I laid it down that preference should be given to the children of parents known to be unemployed and those whose health was likely to benefit specially from attendance at a School Camp.339. That the school children have received great benefit is shown by the fact that their weights increased on average by about 2 lbs. each, whilst in camp. Inspectors of the Board of Educa-tion and the local Education Authorities agree that physically, mentally, and culturally the children gained from the change of air, of food, and of school work. The usual period of .stay was two weeks and the average weekly maintenance cost was 11s. 8d. per head; this covered rent, light, heat, camp staff, doctor and nurse, transport and food.

The responsibility for the executive control of a Camp was shared by a Camp Commandant and a Head Master (or Mis-tress) in their respective spheres of duty, and the following par-ticulars of the camp at Ogmore may be taken as typical of the general plan of the camps. This Camp is situated about 200 yards from the main road and close to the sea, and is well planned for340. The Camps held were as follows : 
its purpose. The Dormitories are in three blocks of two Dormi-tories each. At one end of these are the Ablution Rooms, Shower Baths, and Lavatories (water-flushed). The next block of build-ings consists of the Dining Hall, Cookhouse and Washing-up place, Tuck Shop Stores, Commandant&apos;s Office, Permanent Male Staffs quarters, and Headmaster&apos;s Office. A short distance away, is the Hospital Block, consisting of a Ward, smaller &apos; Isolation Ward, Nurses&apos; quarters, Maid&apos;s Room, and Surgery. Near the entrance is the Staff Common Room and Blanket Store on one side, and the Camp Commandanfs and Headmaster&apos;s Quarters on the other. Lighting throughout is by electricity. Adjoining&apos; the Camp is a playing field for the use of the children.342. The following extracts from the report of the Headmaster of the Barry Camp gives a good impression of the educational work of the School Camps :&quot; The main object has been to improve the mental and moral outlook of the children by bringing them into contact with new spheres of activities and new surroundings. Their life in Camp at all times was in itself an education, and its success is shown in the fact that children and teachers became one happy family. The children were full of questions during their outdoor work, and there was a marked improvement in their moral tone.&quot;The scheme of school work included physical training and organised games, music and community singing, nature study, rambles, collection of nature specimens, local geography, visits to places of interest, the docks and ships in the docks, needle-work, drawing, handwork, country dancing, diaries and letter writing, picnics and rambles and excursions, bathing and swimming instruction in the baths.&quot;343. Educational excursions were arranged to the docks, Cardiff Museum and Castle, a coastguard station, the Vale of Glamorgan, and the Priory and Pottery at Ewenny.Winter Programme344. At the suggestion of the local Education Authorities, the two Camps at Drigg in Cumberland and at Pembrey in South Wales are being used during the winter as residential schools for children likely to benefit (in the School doctor&apos;s view) from a longer stay by the sea. I was advised that the climatic conditions in the North East area would make a similar arrangement there inadvis-able. The winter months are also being utilised for carrying out various improvements to the camps suggested by last year&apos;s experience, and for the establishment of additional camps, so that greater numbers. may be benefited in the coming summer.
Use of Camps by unemployed345. During the summer school holidays, mainly in August, some of the camps were used by large numbers of unemployed men and women who, also, greatly benefited from a week&apos;s stay by the sea.Programme for 1936346. In view of the successful results attending this effort in 1935, and with the full concurrence of the various authorities and organisations concerned, I have decided to repeat the scheme on a larger scale during 1936. The necessary financial arrangements have been made with the National Council to improve and enlarge the existing accommodation where necessary, and to provide six additional camps so that about 45,000 school children and teachers may be provided for.Educational Activities347. In my First Report I referred to the grant-aid which had been given, through the National Council of Social Service, for the development of many forms of activity which, though informal, were of an educational character. In the Special Areas unemploy-ment has for some years been so large a factor in the life of the community that many of the social and cultural activities formerly to be found there have waned for lack of support, but the growth of the movement for occupational clubs has shown that very many men and women weleome opportunities to join in useful and in-structive activities while they are unemployed. The need for food for the mind and imagination is no less real than the need of bodily food, and the grant for educational services has enabled a great deal of fresh activity to be set on foot.348. In South Wales the South Wales Council of Social Service has enabled the Workers&apos; Educational Association, the National Council of Music, the Y.M.C.A. and other organisations very largely to extend the services they offer. It is not possible to give a full report while the winter&apos;s programme is in progress, but the following interim report shows the kind of work that is being assisted and give some indication of the members participating. The Workers&apos; Educational Association in the winter season of 1934-1935 organised 35 one-year courses, 95 terminal courses and 31 short schools. In the winter season of 1935-1936 they have organised 38 one-year courses and 991 terminal courses, and are continuing the provision of short schools. The Y.M.C.A. in the season 1934-1935 organised 118 lecture courses, lasting from six to twelve weeks, and 615 popular lectures. For the season 1935-1936 they have organised 50 lecture courses up to the beginning of January and nearly 650 popular lectures. The National Council of Music in the season 1934-1935 organised eleven one-year courses and 26 terminal courses, 34188 d
and a wide range of music-making groups, orchestral work, choral singing and festivals. For the season 1935-1936 they have organised 7 one-year courses and 24 terminal courses, and the remainder of the programme has been continued and extended. Similar means are being employed to stimulate dramatic work; play reading and acting groups are given coaching and other assistance and a play-writing competition has revealed considerable latent talent in that art.349. 52 drama courses have been conducted by the Drama Organisers working under the general supervision of the South Wales Council. They have also held two schools for producers and they organise a festival at which Welsh&apos; and English plays are produced.350. The numbers participating in regular study courses amounted in 1934-1935 to about 3,000, and in 1935-1936 to over 4,000; but those attending lectures, schools and other activities totalled many times that number.351. In some of its forms this work is aided by the Board of Education and the local Education Authorities, but the grant from the Special Areas Fund has largely increased the range and number of educational activities and has thus helped to stimulate interest in the more serious forms of study.352. A beginning has been made with similar educational work id other Special Areas where local circumstances, though different, point to a similar need. The Tyneside Council of Social Service has developed its musical, dramatic and informal educational work during the winter of 1935-1936 in the clubs and centres associated with the Council. There are now between 25 and 30 centres for unemployed men, and more than 20&apos; groups for unemployed women and wives of unemployed men, in the area of the Tyneside.Council. A drama festival has been held and a handicrafts exhibition is in prospect. Other educational work is at present carried on mainly through popular lectures. The Newcastle Philharmonic Orchestra has been enabled to give a series of demonstration concerts to members of clubs in the Tyneside area. These concerts have been much appreciated, and have been of considerable educational value.353. The Durham Community Service Council&apos;s educational pro-gramme was not initiated until the summer of 1935, and a full season&apos;s work has not yet been carried through. In conjunction with the Workers&apos; Educational Association the Council has organised lo special courses in occupational clubs, attended by some 300 students, and has held two one-day schools. Five more short schools have been arranged for the early months of 1936. Two drama organisers have been appointed, to work in clubs for unemployed men and for women, and between 15 and 20 groups have been successfully
started. An organiser for musical work was appointed in October, 1935, and has established 12, choirs in occupational clubs, with a membership of about 250 persons, which include both men and women.PART IXMISCELLANEOUSSubsistence Production Scheme354. My First Report contained (paragraph 151) a general description of the type of scheme which has come to be known by the name &quot; Subsistence Production Scheme &quot;-. The idea under-lying such a scheme is to establish .a community of unemployed persons primarily engaged on working on the. land for their own mutual advantage but carrying on, in addition, small central work-shops for boot-making, tailoring, baking and other such.activities. Production is only for consumption and exchange within the com-munity, the object of the scheme being to provide useful, healthy and interesting occupation for those at present unemployed who are not likely to find their way back into active industrial employ-ment, and at the same time to raise their standard of living.355. An account was given in paragraph 152 of my First Report of the preliminary stages of the establishment in the Eastern Valley of Monmouthshire of one of these schemes which I had decided to. assist. Since that Report was rendered, much progress has been made, and I felt justified in encouraging the organisers in their effort to help 1,000 families. I have offered them financial assistance from the Special Areas Fund up to a maximum of  40,000, leaving them to raise a similar amount from voluntary sources. As much public interest has been centred on the possibili-ties inherent in this&apos; novel type of scheme, it is worth while record-ing in some detail the progress which has been made. About 260 men have now been enrolled and are at work, and the rule that the produce of the work performed is for consumption only in the household of the member of the scheme has been strictly enforced from the beginning.356. Development has. taken place principally in the three direc-tions indicated in my First Report namely : A Central Farm. Hor-ticultural Plots and Central Workshops.Central Farm357. A number of improvements and alterations have been made at the Central Farm. A further 28 acres has been added, bring-ing the total up to 300. Four cottages are being built on the farm and are nearing completion. These will he occupied by men on the scheme. The -fine herd of -Ayrshire cows has justified the erection of a first class cowshed and dairy, with modern machinery. 84183 D $
Water has been laid on for a;ll farm arid household requirements, the men themselves having done all;Ithe trenching work.- A con-crete reservoir, holding one week&apos;s emergency supply,, has been installed. The farm has been improved by the installation of elee-tricity, by thorough fencing and hedging throughout, and by many minor alterations.Belays of men are transferred to the farm, for a few days at a time, to assist the permanent men, and the farm house has been used as a hostel for them. L1Meat is now regularly killed, providing beef and mutton to the central stores.- The main output of the farm up to the present has been milk, which is of a very high quality. The average demand for this is for two pints per family per day, which is not only in excess of the present supply, but more than would normally be purchased were the men unable to obtain it through the Sub-sistence Production Society. With the completion of the new cowshed and a further increase in the number of cows, the milk supply should then equal the demand.Horticultural Plots358. There are now six horticultural plots, with the likelihood of another being obtained before very long. Each plot has its own hut for stores and mess rooni. The total area of the plots is now 114 acres ?,.-Green and root vegetables of every kind are produced on all the plots and have been eagerly purchased. In addition, two large greenhouses have been built on one plot, where there are expecta-tions this year of approximately 10,000 lbs. of tomatoes. Last year, with a late start, some 3,000 lbs. were produced.On four of the plots bees are kept, and a fair quantity of honey has already been obtained. Potatoes did not do well last year, but this was the general experience throughout the country. An interesting feature is that, on one piece of ground, a lime quarry has been successfully worked., and from six. to seven tons of lime burned per week for use on the land. Another kiln is being added and there should soon be an output of some 14 tons weekly.On tw7o of the plots pigs are reared and on four of them there are some 1,100 head of poultry.Central Workshops359. It is in the Central Workshops that progress has been most marked. The Old Brewery building, obtained earlier in the year, has undergone further extensive alterations, and over 100 men are regularly at work in the building.-   - .     &quot;1  &quot; -&quot; &apos;    . .&apos;-The final alterations to this building are now nearing completion. In addition to the. woodwork, boot repairing and &quot;tailoring depart-ments mentioned in the lastReport, all of which have increased their, capacities, other. sections have- been added, notably that of
a bakery and knitting department. : Short: time tuition in the knitting section has led to the. production of a lull range of goods, all of which have found ready purchasers. The knitting machinery consists of four fiat and three circular machines, a skein winder, and an over-sewer.An excellent modern bakery plant, i-ecently installed, is now working to its full capacity. An experienced baker is in charge of the team in this department, and the quality of the produce is second to none. From two to three hundred loaves per day are bilked, apart from cakes, pies and other varieties in large quantities. The demand, has always exceeded the supply, and this department is now one of the essential features of the scheme. The bread and cakes are of a far better quality than that which the men could afford to purchase elsewhere. This applies not only to the bakery department but to other sections supplying foodstuffs. Many of the men themselves affirm that their health has definitely improved since joining the Society, and it is fair to say that this improve-ment is not a little due to the superior quality of the food obtained.Coal360. The Society has recently obtained possession of a suitable coal level. Work on this is. commencing immediately and the coal won should meet the demand of the scheme at its present membership. Sixty tons per week are required, which provides approximately three cwts.. per man per week, and also a further five tons weekly for central heating at the Old Brewery, and for the green-houses, the farm, store huts, etc.Youth Hostels Association361. The Youth Hostel movement, while by no means novel in its essentials, has in recent years developed upon more organised lines in this country, as it has done on the Continent. The Youth Hostels Association (England and Wales) was formed in 1930, under the auspices of the National Council of Social Service. It Las made rapid progress, as is shown by a membership of 48,000 and the fact that 240 hostels were under the Association^ control in 1935, and that during that year the accommodation provided exceeded a total of 307,000 nights&apos; lodgings. The standard over-might charge is one shilling. Each hostel is under the supervision of a competent Warden who is responsible for the conduct of the hostel, which has separate dormitories for boys and girls, and sepa-rate washing facilities. The Common Room for meals and facilities for cooking are used by both boys and girls. Well-cooked meals are served at almost all the larger hostels, but there are always facilities provided where young people may do their own cooking.362. I am of opinion that the movement represented by this Association is one. which can be of material benefit to the Special Areas, both economically and socially.   The hostels are rapidly34182 ..- D 3
increasing in popularity, and last year at one hostel on the borders of the Special Areas,&quot; provided with 75 beds, over 1,100 people had to be turned away during one week-end. In November, 1935, I invited the Association to consider whether they would be agree-able, with help from the Special Areas Fund, to increase the number of their hostels in the Special Areas.363. The Association, in their own words, &quot; set out to be much more than merely an association of cheap lodging house keepers,&quot; They are pledged to provide cheap lodgings as a means and not as an end. An obvious and primary aim is health of body and mind. This is favoured by outdoor life and the minor adventures of walk-ing or, as it is now frequently termed, &quot; hiking,&quot; as well as by pedal cycling. Another advantage is the. increased knowledge and enjoyment of our own countryside, and appreciation of our historical tradition. Further, there is the inculcation of greater care for the preservation of the countryside, and of the necessity to abate the litter nuisance and to protect bird and beast and flower life as well as buildings. Another object is described as a return to a simpler standard of living which offers a welcome relief to city dwellers. The opportunities for cooking their own meals and for sharing in the general duties of the household before they leave a hostel iu the morning furnish a useful training for young people.364. Apart from these primary aims, the Hostels are also made available on special terms during out-of-season times to the un-employed. Many parties of young unemployed under the guidance of competent leaders have used the hostels for a week&apos;s tramp. They have made some contribirtion towards the cost of their meals but they have been the guests of the Association so far as sleeping accommodation, rucksack equipment and hostel facilities are concerned.305. The use of Hostels and the incidental travel have encouraged a study, of different parts of the country and of differing conditions. It is desirable to&quot; bring it home, to the Southerner and the residents in the other more prosperous parts of the country that there are objects of interest in our Special Areas. Bach of the Special Areas includes districts of considerable natural, beauty as well as districts devoted to industrial life. The more that these areas are visited the more informed will be public opinion and, to a modest extent, the more money will&apos; be spent in the Special Areas. From, the point of view of local; inhabitants, the cultivation of walking among the youth qfr the Special Areas is to be encouraged. They will benefit from the. exercise and from the freedom. Further contact with travellers of all social classes from other parts of the country will widen their outlook on life.366. The Association has informed me that there is a great need for additional Hostels and they are now considering how far this need can be met in combination with my desire to assist the pro-vision of Hostels in the Special Areas. I hope to report further on progress made in this direction in my next Report.
Summer Camps for Military Training367. I referred in my First Report to a new Summer Military Camp at Tow Law in County Durham which was established.&apos;.in .1935 as a result of suggestions made to Lord Bailsham, then Secretary of State for War. who supported the proposal. .1 am glad to be able to report that this experiment had the happiest results. The officers and men established the most friendly relations with the inhabitants and brought to this very deserving area some additional employment and considerable purchasing power, from which ail the local traders seem to have benefited. Moreover, the people in this rather lonely district have now made a number of friends in Catteiiek and elsewhere. I have reason to believe also that the experience of training on new ground w-as considered of value by the Military authorities.368. Lord Hailsham&apos;s successors as Secretary of State for War, Lord Halifax and Mr. Duff Cooper, have also been most sym-pathetic, and I have pressed for the extension of this form of enterprise as far as military exigencies and geographical considera-tions permit. The arrangements for 1936 contemplate the establish-ment of a new Training Camp at ITaltwhistle in Northumberland for Territorial Army Units during June to August, and a camp for Territorial Army Units near Swansea in South Wales, the exact period of which has not yet been decided. It is hoped further that regular troops will have returned from abroad in time to use the Camp at Haltwhistle in September and to establish a Camp at Tow Law in August and September as in 1935.Adoption369. My First Report (paragraphs 154 to 159) made reference to the many admirable &quot; adoption &quot; schemes which had come to my notice. The growth of this work is evidence of increasing interest in the Special Areas. I have not attempted to compile a complete list of all the schemes, but the following facts give a clear indication of the strength of the adoption movement.370. Thirty-seven cases have come to my notice of areas severely affected by unemployment having been adopted by comparatively prosperous areas, or by the staffs of banks, commercial firms and the B.B.C. In addition,  21,500 has been subscribed by the members of &quot; adoption &quot; associations in thirty-four branches or departments of the Civil Service, the number, of places adopted being about sixty. Most of these places are situated in. the Special Areas.371. Of the schemes of this type which have been made known to me, I have selected three for description. -    &quot;34182 p 4
The County of Surrey Scheme. : 372. The first is the effort of the County of Surrey, under the leadership of Sir John Jarvis, M.P. In paragraph 159 of my First Report reference was made to this endeavour to assist Jarrow by the establishment of new and the revival of old industries, by the supply Of materials with which unemployed men might redecorate their homes, and by other means. It is gratifying to be able to report that these activities have continued to develop. It is understood that over  36,000 has now been subscribed to the Surrey Fund.373. In regard to industries, a new factory has been set up for the manufacture of furniture, largely of steel, and Sir John Jarvis has been able to secure the purchase for approximately  100,000 of the Cunard - White Star Liner &quot; Olympic &quot; for breaking up at Jarrow. A berth was prepared for the ship at a cost of  2,600, this expense being shared between the Surrey Fund and the Tyne Improvement Commission. A successful experiment had previously been conducted in the breaking up of a smaller vessel purchased for the purpose. Work on the &quot; Olympic &quot;-began some months ago and it is hoped that it will continue to provide employment for a considerable number of unemployed men during 1936.374. Apart from these efforts in the field of industry, the Surrey Fund has supplied materials for the redeooration of nearly 2,000 homes of unemployed men ; a fishing boat has been bought for the use of the unemployed; equipment has been provided for children&apos;s playing fields ; and assistance has been given in other directions.375. I have co-operated with the Surrey Fund by giving or promising assistance from the Special Areas Fund for two of their schemes in Jarrow, viz., the acquisition of premises for a Boys&apos; Club and the establishment of an open-air nursery School.The County of Hertfordshire Scheme376. The second scheme is that of the County of Hertfordshire, under the leadership of its late High Sheriff, Captain R. Humphrey Haslam. Under this scheme, residents in the County have sub-scribed over  16,000, of which  12,000 has been used on works of a capital nature in County Durham, the balance being available for the purpose of future maintenance. The works have included the supply of materials for the building, by the voluntary labour of unemployed men, of twelve occupational centres for the unemployed at Beamish, Blaydon, Byers Green, Escomb, Felling, Grange Villa, Pelaw, Sacriston, Spennymoor, Toronto, West Auckland and Witton Gilbert; the erection of a large boys&apos; club at Felling-on-Tyne; the establishment of six poult^ and pig centres at. Blaydon, Byers Green, Felling, Grange Villa, Page Bank and West Auck-land, and a scheme in the grounds of Hardwick Hall, Durham, for
the training of unemployed men in pig and poultry keeping; assist-ance to a farm training scheme, to a gardens guild for providing gardens around occupational centres, and to a holiday home for women at Cliffe House, Seahain Harbour ; and a scheme, worked in co-operation with the Ministry of Labour, for the transference of Durham unemployed to employment in Hertfordshire.The Bedford Rotary Club Scheme377. The third scheme is under the auspices of the Rotary Club of Bedford. The Bedford Rotarians have taken under their wing an isolated and unattractive village in Durham known as Eden Pit (near Bishop Auckland), where practically all work has ceased. The idea originated with Mr. H. W. Liddle, Headmaster of Bedford Modern School, and both he and Colonel G. Hayward Wells, the Honorary Secretary of the Rotary Club, have received enthusiastic support in their endeavours to alleviate distress at Eden Pit. Not only have they been instrumental in arranging that such necessaries as clothing, bedding, etc., were provided for the villagers, but, in co-operation with the Ministry of Labour, they have also directed them efforts towards obtaining employment in the Bedford area for persons suitable for transfer from the village. My latest informa-tion is that 20 people, including two families, have already been provided with work and accommodation, and it is interesting to note that other Rotary Clubs contemplate following the good example of Bedford.378. Indeed, this form of adoption, involving transfer from the Special Areas and establishment in an area of expanding industrial activity, is in my judgment most valuable ; and I particularly com-mend it to any of the relatively prosperous communities who may now be considering the institution of an adoption scheme.The St. Paul&apos;s, Nork, Employment Scheme379. An interesting and useful employment scheme has been running since the middle of 1935 in the Nork Parish of the Banstead Urban District, Surrey. The organisers are the Vicar and two of his Church workers, and they are assisted by a number of voluntary collectors.380. Under this scheme, subscribers pay Is. or multiples thereof per week, and in return for each shilling per week subscribed they receive four hours&apos; work per calendar month from men employed by the. organisers. Thus for every 52 shillings per annum sub-scribed,&apos; 48 hours&apos; work per annum is received. The small surplus of subscriptions over wages suffices to pay National Health Insur-ance contributions, premiums on an insurance policy protecting subscribers from employees liability, and the small running ex-perises. of the scheme, such as the cost of printing. The men are engaged from the distressed areas through the Ministry of Labour
ioo:but, before being sent to-Banstead, they are interviewed by the Toe H of their home area, by whom references are taken up. The wages paid are  2 10s.&apos; per week nett (Is. per hour).381. The work given to the men may be either in the house or the garden-, and includes such jobs as window cleaning, furniture polish-ing,&apos; painting,- distempering,- cementing, all kinds of work in the garden, and the washing and greasing of motor cars. They are at liberty to,look for work in their own trades (or any other trade) but are expected, if they find employment, to give a month&apos;s notice to the organisers, so that they may be replaced without breaking the continuity of the supply of labour to the subscribers.382. The advantages of the scheme are obvious. The subscriptions-tion is small; good value for money is received; and new employ-ment is created, since a condition is imposed on subscribers that existing employment should not be disturbed.383. I feel that this ingenious scheme should be capable of ex-tension to other areas. In middle class surburban or urban districts, there is a good demand for handymen who can give occasional services on a multitude of miscellaneous jobs of the kind referred to above. No one family may be able to afford the whole time employment of a man but, if a number of families combine, there will be enough employment. to occupy a man or several men with-out displacing any local labour.Miscellaneous Gifts384. I have been asked, in a number of instances, to give advice to individuals and groups of individuals (which have included a girls&apos; Secondary School and the congregation of a Church, both outside the Special Areas) who have wished to help a Special Area by means of gifts in cash or kind, and I have welcomed the oppor-tunity of putting these generous donors into touch with appropriate organisations.PART X FINANCE385. Paragraph 174 of my First Report referred to the payment into the Special Areas Fund of an initial sum of  2,000,000 of which, provisionally,  1,500,000 was regarded as at my disposal Reference was also made to the fact that the promise of the Govern-ment to find further funds, should this prove necessary, made un-justifiable the suggestion that the sum thus provided represented a limit beyond which grants could not be made. The validity of this statement is amply illustrated by the fact that, as -indicated below, schemes involving grants amounting to over  3,000,000 have already been approved, and further schemes are receiving con-sideration on-their merits without regard to a maximum financial Commitment.   At no time and on no occasion have I refused-any

The figure of commitment is based on an estimated average cost per scheme.grant on the ground that the necessary funds would not be available, nor has the sanction of the appropriate Department of the Govern-ment at any time been withheld because of. the amount of expendi-ture involved by any recommendation made by me.386. As foreshadowed in my earlier Report, actual expenditure is considerably in arrear of commitments. This obviously is due to unavoidable causes. after a grant is promised, it often takes some time before the work gets into full swing on the scheme sanctioned, and before payments are required. It is in the best interests of all concerned that the schemes undertaken with the aid of grants should be technically sound both in conception and in construction, and the time spent in achieving this is therefore fully justified. The principles which apply to a soundly run business are just as necessary for application when Exchequer money is being expended.387. The following is a summary of the estimated commitments into which 1 have entered to the 31st December, 1935. This figure is inclusive of the figures contained in paragraph 17y of my First Report. Although the JMorth Eastern Housing Association &quot;has now been formed and is in active consultation with local authorities on the question of the housing schemes which it is to undertake, it is still impossible to fix a figure of commitments in this respect. It appears, however, that the token figure of  100,000 provisionally included in the statement of commitments is likely to fall consider-ably short of actual requirements. It is also impossible, at this stage, to say what will be the financial needs of the Training Estates Company which I propose to establish. Therefore, a similar sum is included for this item in my statement of commitments.

APPENDIX VII.Description op grant-aided work among Adolescent Boys and Girls.Young Women&apos;s Christian Association.An Organising Club Leader has been appointed in each of the three Special Areas. Contributions have been made towards the cost of equip, ment, rent and running expenses at 12 new clubs situated at Winlatou, Chopwell, Carr Hill. Forest Hall, Throckley, Birtley, Whitehaven,- Kells, Workington, Maryport, Port Talbot and Cwmavon. The total membership of these new Clubs is over 1,100. Club buildings have been provided at uVIaryport and Kells and premises at Port Talbot have been adapted and equipped. 167 girls from the Special Areas have been given at least a week at camp, from which they have benefited physically, morally and socially, One club leader reported: &quot; One week at camp has done, more for this club than my eighteen months of work&quot;; and another.: &quot;Meeting girls from other places at camp has made all the difference to the keenness and in-genuity of my own club girls &quot;.Care was taken at camp to plan a well-balanced diet, and this has led the . girls to take much interest in the cookery courses -which are being provided (see paragraph 138 of the Report).Girls&apos; Life Brigade.This organisation^ annual report for 1935 said: &quot; A grant received from the Commissioner for special Areas made possible the further development of the Brigade in certain Special Areas, and immediately upon receipt of the grant a campaign was launched in Northumberland, County Durham and South Wales. Activities commenced in April, 1935. By the end of the Brigade year dive Companies had been registered under this scheme and many others were in course of formation &quot;.The grant was used  mainly  to  repair  deficiencies  in  equipment and uniforms, but a special organiser- was appointed for South Wales. National Council of Girls&apos; Clubs (to which is affiliated the Girls&apos; Friendly Society and the Girls1 Guildry).Full-time Club Organisers have been appointed for County Durham and South Wales and a full-time Physical Training Organiser for County Durham. In the latter County 11 new clubs have been set up and two more are about to open, the places concerned being: Boldon, Crook, Felling, Silksworth, Hebburn, iSbildon, Washington, Page Bank, Consett, Stanley, Jarrow, Peases&apos;West and Byers Green. 17 extra &quot;keep-fit&quot; classes have begun or are being planned at-Crook, Penshaw, Bowburn, Gateshead, Byers Green, Page Bank, Shildon (2), Quebec, Washington, Pittington, Browne; Colliery, Hebburn, Felling, Jarrow, Lanchester and Durham.In South Wales the organiser has been working in 18 clubs, at Maesycwmmer, Blaenavon, Crumlin (2), Abercarn (2), Bridgend (3), Caer-pLilly (2), Ebbw Vale (2), Risca, Cwmtillery, Cymmer, Brynmawr and Clydach. She has been particularly active in seeking to obtain the services of voluntary leaders. Visits to give assistance and advice were paid to 12 other places, viz., Kenfig Hill, Llansannor, Six Bells, Treforest, Maesteg, Neath, Llanetly Hill, Cwmcarn, Newbridge, Pontllanfraith, Blackwood and Oakdale.In both County Durham and South Wales money has been spent on equip-ment; aiid premises have been provided or improved at Sunderland, Crumlin, Risca and elsewhere.A special grant for camps has been used partly to reduce the cost to the girls of- a camping holiday, this benefiting nearly 700 girls, partly to pur-chase camping equipment and partly, to contribute towards the cost -of week-end camping. The report on the camps contained the following: -&quot;&quot; The subsidising of holidays was for younger club members who cotildnot other-
wise have raised the total required for their holidays. There are other cases where quite young girls, who have had to mother a large family and on whose shoulders the main burden of housework has fallen, were selected for a holiday, and never were holidays more needed and appreciated. Frequently we received letters attached to the holiday reports which stated that the girls sent away have never before had a holiday &quot;. A, club leader writes : &quot; At the close of each week it was a pleasure to look at the girls&apos; sunburnt faces and to feel that they had been strengthened in a small measure at least to meet the demands of the coming winter &quot;.Old Guides&apos; Association.This Association has used its share of the grant to recondition premises, assist Companies, to meet special expenses; make up some of the shortage of equipment and uniforms and contribute to the expeiises of needy girls attending training courses and camps.In County Durham the Girl Guide movement was helped in some or all of these ways in the following 34 places : Barnard Castle, Annfield Plain, Lanchester, Stanley, Weardale, Stanhope, Whickham, Ryton, Tanfield. Bishop Auckland, Auckland, Shildon, Chester-le^Street, Washington, Con-sett, Benfieldside, Durham, Brandon, Gateshead, Felling, Hartlepool, South Shields, Jarrow, Hehburn, Seaham, Easingtoii, Hetton, Spennymoor, Crook, Tow Law, Willington, Sunderland, Houghton and Blaydqn. At the last-named place a hut is being built for joint use with the Boy Scouts. In addition a successful effort was made to increase the number of guides. The cost of training courses was provided where this could not be afforded, and in this way 133 girls were enabled to attend the residential training school. 100 girls were sent to camp who would otherwise have had no holiday.In Northumberland a shelter was built on the County Camp site at Harlow Hill, and an empty shooting box was also equipped for camping,. The Campers included 100 girls from the poorest districts of Tyneside. 140 other girls were sent to camp who would otherwise have had no holiday.in Cumberland an organiser was appointed, with the result that 160 recruits were secured. A hut for joint, use with the Y.W.C.A. was bought at Rolls. Contributions, were made towards camp fees and transport, and the purchase of equipment. &quot; This help was most essential, as numbers of these guides would never have got to camp, at all if it had not been for the grant &quot;.In Glamorgan some qf the; money was allocated in sums varying from  5 to  1? tq each Division for training young and new guiders, in the Special Areas, the Divisional Officers &quot; undertaking to investigate each case personally to assure themselves that the guiders would then pass on their training to other guiders in their districts and that they would aim at increasing their numbers and starting new ranger companies in the Special Areas &quot;. The training has been described as the best fillip that guiding has had in these somewhat, isolated districts and valleys. The result has beep an increase of companies and rangers in the Special Areas;. Part of the money was used to assist in the purchase of huts at Brynmenyn, Aberkenfig, Forth, Llwynpia and Whitchurch (Cardiff), and to provide equipment and uniforms for girls in Mountain Ash. &quot; Uniforms were given only to workr ing guiders who were unable to pay for them and in places where the in-spiration of wearing uniform would assist in obtaining n.ew guides.&quot;, The help given also led indirectly to the acquisition of a permanent County camp site. 143 needy guides were, sent to camp and. maivy others, were helped with transport and equipment, 29 places in this County s.h.are.d m the benefits of the gra.nt, including the foUqwing; Whitchuvch, Rhqose, Dinas, Powis, Ll&amp;nishan, Llantwit, Llanmaes, Aberdare, Mountain Ash, Maesteg, Ogmore Vale, Aberkenfig, Brynmenyn, Aberavon, Pyle (and
Kenfig), Keritig Hill, Pontypridd, Pbrth (and Mid-Rhondda), Rhondda Fach, Ystrad Mynach, Bargoed, Nelson, Abertridwr, Llantrisant and Tonyrefail.In Monmouthshire a hut was bought at Tredegar, assistance was given with special expenses and a large number of girls from the distressed areas were enabled to go to camp. &quot;They contributed something themselves according to what was possible. In many cases it would have been impossible for girls to go to camp without outside assistance &apos;-.At Pembroke a hut was purchased and assistance was given with equip, ment and training.In Breconshire a new company was formed at Vaynor and assistance was given with rents, lighting and uniforms, the places benefiting being Cefn, Vaynor and Pendoryn. &apos;National Association of Boys&apos; Clubs. ;During 1935 the number of clubs affiliated to the Association increased ia the Special Areas, from 9 to 25; and 4 more new clubs are being formed. &quot; A grant to supplement local effort has not only made the formation of a club possible, but the club when formed has so fired enthusiasm in the dis-trict that the problem of voluntary leadership is in many cases being solved &quot;.In County Durham shortage of equipment is being made up. Gymnasium equipment has been supplied to clubs at Siiksworth, Sunderland, Gateshead, Southchurch, Hebburn, West Hartlepool; premises were purchased at Heb&apos; burn and South Hylton; and assistance was also given to clubs at Bishop Auckland, Jarrow, Chester-le-Street and elsewhere. Part of the expenses of a County camp were provided and hoys from Hartlepool, Southchurch and Gateshead were assisted to camp.In Northumberland a salaried, organiser was appointed. Assistance was given to improve premises and supply gymnasium and other equipment at clubs at North Shields, Newcastle (3), Walker and Wallsend. The County Association ran a camp for 1,400 boys.In Cumberland premises were adapted and gymnasium kit purchased for one club and equipment purchased for. another in Workington; premises were adapted and equipment purchased for one club and gymnasium equip-ment purchased for another in Whitehayen; and premises were adapted and gymnasium and other equipment purchased for a club in Cleator Moot. Two Club Leaders were enabled to attend a long course in physical training at the Carnegie Physical Training College at Leeds, and 11 unemployed men were subsidised during a. ten days&apos; training course with a view to their helping in Boys&apos; Clubs on their return. Boys from Workington and White-haven were assisted to camp. &quot; There is perhaps no part of the country where such rapid progress has been made in such a short time. ... To-day there is growing interest and enthusiasm. . . . Before the close of the winter season there is every reason to hope that there will be seven affiliated clubs in Workington, Whitehaven, Maryport and Cleator Moor&quot;.In South Wales &quot;the Special Areas grant has been of real value in strengthening the Federation and providing assistance for a number of Clubs &quot;, and boys have been assisted to attend the Federation^ camp at St. than.Boys&apos; Brigade.. The report received from the Brigade said: &quot;By means of the funds placed at its disposal the Boys&apos; Brigade has been able during the past year to develop very considerably its work in the Special Areas, thus bringing to the boys of these localities the training and esprit de corps which means so much to them in the difficult surroundings in which they are growing up &quot;, and: &quot;One of the principal results of the assistance given cannot easily bo tabulated.   It lies in the spirit of increased vitality in all&apos;the units of tie
Special Areas.. : A feeling of /hopefulness and progress has been engendered --which&apos; cannot but: mean that many thousands of  boys will .&apos;.gain. realbentiit &quot;. :.-:.-;-;-&apos;-.&apos;*-- In. the North-East a, full-time organiser was appointed and a physical training expert has ,visited the Area. 19 new-Companies have been formed at Bishop Auckland, Broom Park, Crook, Hebburn, Jarrow, Newcastle (2), Consett, Spennymoor (2), Springwcll, South Shields (3), Tow Law (2), North Shields, Wellington Quay and Washington. Training courses for officers have been held (and the efficiency of the work thereby greatly increased) for the following nine Battalions, comprising 133 Companies, Gateshead, Hartle-pools, Jarrow and Hebburn, Newcastle, North-West Durham, South Shields, Sunderland; Tynemouth and Tyne Valley. The Jarrow and Hebburn Battalion was in danger of collapsing, but a subsistence allowance was made to an experienced officer, who spent his full time in restoring the vitality of the work in the area. The Sunderland Battalion was greatly helped by the purchase of a commodious wooden building. Assistance was given with the rent of premises at Consett, Oxhill, and Bishop Auckland, and towards the completion of premises at Newcastle, Annfield Plain and Eemington. Camp equipment was bought, and this enabled the cost to the boys of their annual camp to be,greatly reduced. 471 boys in specially necessitous cir-cumstances were enabled to spend a week at camp at very reduced cost. Permanent improvements were effected to the site and equipment of the camping ground at Seaham Harbour of the Newcastle Battalion and 86&quot;4 boys from Newcastle, Sunderland and parts of Durham were assisted to camp there.In West Cumberland a new Company was formed at Maryport and given ah equipment grant. The Companies at Cockermouth, Dearham, Harring-ton and Workington were helped by the holding of a local training course for officers and by equipment grants.
