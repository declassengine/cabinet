-    357THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1936.SECRET. Copy No.    54CP. 30 (36).CABINET.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.DEFENCE CO-ORDINATION.Remarks by the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial defence on Recent Suggestions. . -(Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister.)THERE has lately arisen in the press a considerable demand for the appointment of a Minister of Defence. This has been voiced by the Times and Major-General Temperley, the Military Correspondent of the Daily Telegraph and Major-General Gwynne in the Morning Post and has received support in letters from Lord Salisbury, Lord Trenchard, Lord Milne and General Charles, Admiral Richmond, Generals Sir Ian Hamilton, Godley, Robb and some of the group of M.P&apos;s. who have advocated a change of system for many years. The movement, therefore, is one that deserves most serious consideration. At the same time, as the late Lord Balfour used to say, it is only the Government itself that can decide the machinery by which its business is to be conducted.2. An attempt is made in this Memorandum to examine the question dispassionately and to try and balance the pros and cons of the existing system and of what is now proposed.A. Ministry of Defence.3. The present movement is rather different from its predecessors. Formerly the hue and cry was for a Ministry of Defence; some fusion of the three Defence Departments into a single Department of State, which would, administer all the forces on sea, land and air, amalgamate their, common services; and, as it was supposed, achieve great economies. Gradually, however, the critics have learned something of the fallacies of that plan. The Salisbury Committee on National and Imperial Defence in 1923 (Cmd. 2029/24) the Mond-Weir Committee on the Amalgamation of the Services common to the Navy, Army and Air Force in 1926 (Cmd. 2649/26) and other Committees declared against&apos; the idea. It has come to be realised that over-centralisation was a mistake; that no single Minister could effectively supervise so huge an organisation even in peace, much less in war; that the supposed economies would not be realised in practice and. that a great deal could be achieved by other methods of . co-ordination. The French Government tried the plan for a short time, but found that the task was too big for a single Minister.. Even in the Dominions it does not work satisfactorily and Australia ha,s adopted a system very similar; to our. own. , * t (.    The new proposal.   A Minister of Defence. .4.   The present demand is for a Minister (not a Ministry) of Defence.   The case rests on the assumption that our present system of co-ordination is [12695] B
inadequate, especially when the magnitude of our present task is taken into consideration. The critics urge, therefore, that a single Minister should be appointed, with a Staff of his own, to work continuously on the central problem of defence, presumably in conjunction with the three Ministers concerned, and so get better value for the large sums of money devoted to Imperial Defence. The Prime Minister, they urge, has too many preoccupations to enable him to direct the Committee of Imperial Defence and its subordinate organisations. He should, they press, delegate this work to a colleague, who could give his whole time to it. It is no longer asserted so confidently as it used to be that the Chiefs of Staff Committee are perpetually quarrelling the refutations of that charge seem to have been accepted, though rather grudgingly. But it is claimed that such measure of agreement as they achieve, which the critics do not appraise very highly, is due to a series of patched-up compromises rather than to any real agreement. The scheme does not appear to have been worked out in any detail. For instance, opinions seem to be vague as to whether the new Minister of Defence is to preside at the Committee of Imperial Defence or whether he should act as deputy to the Prime Minister as has often been tried in the past (as described later). There seems to be fairly general agreement, however, that he should preside over and sit regularly with the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee. Nothing-has been said as to his relations with the Secretaries of State for War and Air and the First Lord of the Admiralty. There is agreement, however, among those who hold these views, that the Minister of Defence should have a Department of his own built up oh the Staff of the Committee of Imperial Defence, but apparently strengthened (or perhaps in practice weakened!) by a separate Staff t( for reviewing and advising the Committee of Imperial Defence On defence questions as a whole &quot; (Major-General Temperley). Lord Milne and Sir Ronald Charles, however, reject this part of the plan. Those who are familiar with the post-war history of the Committee of Imperial Defence wall observe that the system now advocated does not differ very Widely from one that was tried out in various forms from 1920 to 1925 and deliberately dropped, as described later in this Memorandum.5. One thing that the critics do not realise is the continuous and substantial progress that has been made in recent years. This is due partly to improvements in organisation, partly to experience, partly to personalities who work well together, and partly to the influence of the Imperial Defence College, whose graduates are reaching the higher ranks of the General Staffs. It is hot too much to say that a common doctrine is growing up iil the three Services whose mutual requirements and interdependence are now generally realised in a progressive system.Recent Tests of the Present System.6. Before the Government start tinkering with our defensive system, which has been built up as the result of experience in both peace and war, they ought to satisfy themselves that it is inadequate to present and future needs. The critics not being up-to-date are not able to prove inadequacy and have had to fall back on mere allegation. I happened to meet one of the most distinguished of the Times&apos; correspondents on the very day on which his letter had appeared and asked him what were the particular shortcomings he had in mind. He replied that there were a number of questions which we had never even examined, and he promised to send me a district. Next day, hoping to get some useful suggestions, I sent him a polite reminder of his promise. The list of questions he sent in had without exception been dealt with and decided long ago.7: The present system had been subjected to a fairly good &quot;dress rehearsal &quot; during the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. In one respect it was rather a hard test because strained relations or War with Italy were the last thing that anyone expected. Long before the crisis reached an acute stage the appropriate ;Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence was examining the question of sanctions so that our Ministers arid experts at Geneva might be properly equipped to deal with the question if and when it arose. The moment a possible danger of war became discernible the Chiefs of Staff Committee advised as to the proper precautions to be taken.   The Cabinet approved them
and remitted to the Sub-Cqmmittee on Defence Pqiicy and. Requirempnts* (which for the puvp.qs.es of this crisis discharged functions similar to those of. the War Committee during, the middle part of the War) the task of dealing with the situation in detail. Since then, under the general direction of the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee the wbole of the machinery of the Commit tee of Imperial Defence has been mobilised. The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, with assistance from the Deputy Chiefs of Staff, and especially the Joint Planning Committee, have regularly advised the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements on all questions relating to military policy, distribution of forces, and plans. ;They have put their respective Commanders-in-Chief in the Eastern Mediterranean in contact and taken other measures to ensure that the close co-ordination at the centre is reflected locally. Although the necessity did not arise of working the machine at war pressure, questions have been handled expeditiously, and if there have been any slight differences of opinion they have been settled promptly by agreement without recourse to Ministers. The closest possible contact has been maintained between the Chiefs of Staff and the Foreign Office and; Colanial Office.8. The other Committees of the Committee of Imperial Defence concerned in this crisis have worked with equal smoothness in order to adapt the planned artnngements to the particular emergency that threatened.This applies to :  The Oversea Defence Committee, at which arrangements were concerted for bringing Defence Schemes into operation so far as requisite at British ports abroad;The Home Defence Committee, which adapted to the requirements of the possible crisis measures of Home Defence;The Man-Power Committee;The Oil Board;The Principal Supply Officers Organisation; The Censorship Sub-Committee;The Imperial Communications Committee, which concerted arrange-ments with the Imperial Wireless and Telegraph Company;The Advisory Committee on Trade Questions in Time of War, which did much work both on economic sanctions and adaptation to the threatened emergency of preconcerted arrangements;The Sub-Committee on Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries, which submitted reports on Italian industrial organisation;The Sub-Committee on War Emergency Legislation, which took up the question of adaptation of the War Emergency Legislation and regulations to the present crisis a question which was found to have political implications and was handed over for completion in detail by a Home Office inter-departmental Committee under the chairmanship of Sir George Schuster;The Board of Trade Committee on War Risks Insurance, which adapted the prearranged scheme to the present emergency;The Co-ordination Sub-Committee, which adapted the War Book to the present emergency;The Official Sub-Committee in Abyssinia under the Chairmanship of the Permanent tinder-Secretary of the Colonial Office, which has dealt with a number of miscellaneous problems peculiar to the present crisis arising in the Colonies affected.The whole machine worked, smoothly and rapidly with one or possibly two&apos; exceptions, which could have been speeded up if a crisis had developed.9. The defects that were disclosed-e.gr., in the supply of anti-aircraft ammunition-were all known defects which had repeatedly been brought to the notice of Ministers, but which, for reasons of policy and/or finance it had not, hitherto been found possible to remedy..* The existence of the Committee on Defence policy and Requirements has: not yet been, reported to Parliament/:[12695] b 2
r   - , 4 :    &apos;. 10. All pur information shows that no other nation in the world displayed a prevision in planning or in action at any stage of the emergency in any way comparable to our own.11. It could also be shown that in the Shanghai crisis of 1927 the Committee of Imperial Defence organisation and the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (with its Joint Planning Committee) in particular showed a similar prevision. The advice of the Chiefs of Staff was so cogent that, although Japan declared that no emergency sufficient to necessitate the despatch of troops threatened, the infantry of a division was-despatched six weeks in advance of the crisis and arrived in the nick of time to avert a catastrophe at Shanghai (C.I.D. Paper No. 764-B). Throughout the prolonged and difficult crisis the machine worked with perfect smoothness and without any of those bickerings which, according to some critics, afflict the Staffs of the Defence Services.12. One is entitled to ask in what particular respects our system was found wanting in these tests, or what country has a better system. I have received indications that the French are impressed by our system and, not for the first time, are considering its adoption.*Preparation of Defensive Programmes.13. The critics, however, would perhaps say that it is not so much for an emergency that the present system is inadequate, but for the ordinary preparation of defensive programmes, especially at the present time, when a reconditioning of the defence forces and defences is an admitted necessity. The idea is being-propagated that at present no serious attempt is being made to adapt the Services to the newer methods of warfare, and that, in consequence, the taxpayer is not getting full value for his money. A Minister of Defence, it is claimed, would overrule the recommendations of the separate Services and establish a better disposition of our forces.14. Since the end of 1933 the plan adopted for drawing up defensive programmes has been to remit them to (i) The Defence Requirements Committee, composed of  ; The Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence (in the Chair).The Three Chiefs of Staff. The Secretary to the Treasury.The Permanent Uncler-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whose reports are submitted to and examined in detail by -1    (ii) A Ministerial Committee, presided over by the Prime Minister, which reports direct to the Cabinet.15. Perhaps the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence is not the best person to judge as to whether this system has worked satisfactorily or not, as he happens to have presided throughout at the Defence Requirements Committee. The following observations, however, are permissible :-(a) that under any system the active co-operation of the Treasury andForeign Office is essential from the earliest stages in drawing up long-range defensive programmes for the three Services;(b) that under any system a Ministerial Committee is essential beforeexpenditure on so large a scale could be approved (there has usually been a, good deal of delay in reaching Ministerial decisions -in 1934 owing to the uncertainties of the Disarmament situation, and in 1935 owing to the General Election and the Italo-Abyssinian crisis, but this &quot;would have occurred under any system); (e) that in a matter of Government policy of this; magnitude the Prime Minister would rarely be willing to delegate his responsibility;* During the war M. Painleve adopted our War. Committee system look, stock and barrel, and attached an Officer of the War Cabinet Secretariat to study it, after which he became Secretary to the Frehoh War Committee. But M. Clemenceau swept it all away without trial. A few years ago, after studying our system they set up something analogous, and M. flandin sent iin official over, in March 1934, to study our Cabinet system, but after he went out of office the idea seems to have been dropped.
(d) that those Ministers who would.be mainly concerned in the conduct of a ..     .   war-the Prime Minister, . Chancellor of the Exchequer, Foreign Secretary, the three Service Ministers and the President of the Board of Trade (on the industrial and economic side)&apos; are boUhd:to&apos; be associated with drawing up large-scale defensive programmes; &quot;    : (e) that the implementation Of the: approved programmes must devolve upon &apos;&apos; the Service Ministers and their Departments, subject: to co-ordination in detail for which the machinery of the Committee of Imperial Defence is available; *(/) that the present system is not having the result of throwing the Air Forces&apos; and mechanisation generally into the background.16. The real question at issue, therefore, is whether (A) in drawing up the programmes, or (B) in carrying them out, a Minister of Defence would be more effective than the present system.Previous Experience.17. On this point experience at the Committee of Imperial Defence raises-doubts. After the War Mr. Lloyd George, with the heavy work of international conferences and post-war problems, was unable to give much attention to the Committee of Imperial Defence and he remitted most of the work to a body entitled the Standing Defence Sub-Committee (corresponding more or less to the existing Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committees) at which Lord Balfour almost invariably took the Chair. The system was continued by Mr. Bonar Law and his successor Mr. Baldwin, in whose Governments Lord-Salisbury acted as Chairman of the Standing Defence Sub-Committee until it was. brought to an end in July 1923.18. In 1923 there was an inquiry by a Sub-Committee ,under Lord Salisbury&apos;s Chairmanship into National and Imperial. Defence, the report of which* recommended, inter alia, the appointment of a Chairman to the Committee of Imperial Defence as a deputy to the Prime Minister. Lord Salisbury now became Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence, presiding both at the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee. He was, succeeded by Lord Haldane in Mr. Ramsay MacDonald&apos;s first administration and by Lord Curzon when Mr. Baldwin again became Prime Minister in 1924..19. Even under such distinguished and experienced statesmen the system did not work particularly well in practice. None of them did anything which the Prime Minister could not and would not have done equally well. The Prime Ministers of the day naturally left the work of the Committee mainly to the Chairmen. From August, 1922, until February, 1924, the Prime Minister of the day never attended the Committee of Imperial Defence at all, and after that, until February, 1925, only on occasions of exceptional importance. I don&apos;t think I shall be contradicted if I say that on such occasions they.did not always find themselves as fully en rapport with the Committee or its problems as when later on they presided regularly. And when the Prime Minister did not preside there grew up a tendency after the first few meetings for Ministers to absent themselves and to be represented by officials as can be seen from the Minutes. During Lord Curzon&apos;s Chairmanship attendance was normal, but he died before there had been many meetings. During all these years I had, as&apos; Secretary, a strong impression that the Committee of Imperial Defence was going downhill and losing prestige. The duality of control between the Prime Minister as President and the Chairman also caused difficulties.---&apos;   -20. The same was true of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee. For some; reason, which is difficult to explain, the Sub-Committee did not function with a Minister in the Chair as effectiwely as without him. There was an undefinable atmosphere of . restraint which contrasted unfavourably with the spirit of co-operation in the Sub-Committee as it functions to-day. Perhaps it was I difficult for a Chief of Staff to speak his whole mind to an outside Minister in the absence of his own Departmental Minister. Both Lord Salisbury and Lord Haldane sometimes left the Chiefs of Staff to meet alone, and Lord Curzon,* Published as Cmd. 2029 in 1924V&apos; : &apos;[12695] b 3
though he was nominally Chairman, never attended a meeting.  A minor difficulty was ,that the Ministerial, Chairman was so busy with Cabinet Committees, parliamentary, duties and so forth, that it was not easy to fit in meetings of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee. The latter often meet at the same time as the Cabinet, especially in times of crisis. ...       . (. 21. In February 1925 on the death of Lord Curzon, Mr. Baldwin resumed the Chairmanship as Well as the Presidency of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and from that year down to the present time the Prime Minister of the day has regularly presided; at the Committee of Imperial Defence and supervised its work, as well as keeping in touch with the work of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee. These have been years of great progress in our organisation. The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee has functioned with increasing unity and success, and has strengthened its organisation by the establishment of the Sub-Committee of-Deputy Chiefs, of Staff and the Joint Planning Sub-Committee. The (Official): Defence Requirements Committee and the (Ministerial) Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee have come into existence. The Principal Supply Officers Committee has been greatly strengthened. And there has been a great impetus to the work of co-ordination and co-operation as shown by the attached chart.22; Of course it does not follow, because the system of a Chairman who was not the Prime Minister did not produce the best results when reverted to on previous occasions, that it would not succeed or is not required to-day. Admittedly times have changed. Defence problems have become much more pressing. More money is likely to be available. Moreover, personalities count for a great deal. There are, however, certain inherent difficulties most of which have of ten been mentioned. The Prime Minister of the day necessarily &quot; carries more guns &quot;than any other Minister, however distinguished and able he may be. Consequently, he is better placed than any Defence Minister can be for dealing with matters where differences may arise. All members of the Cabinet are equal And a Defence Minister would encounter great difficulty in imposing a decision oil one or more resisting Ministers and Departments. He could only work by the normal methods of conciliation and adjustment employed in political life, and for this heisless well-placed than the Prime Minister. Intractable cases would have to be brought to the Cabinet for decision, and probably these would be more frequent than to-day, when they are very rare in defence questions owing to the spirit, of team work that has been created by the present system.23. The main criticism against the higher control of our policy in the Great War was that Ministers interfered too much in operations; for example, Mr, ChurchilUs activities in the inception of the naval attack on the Dardanelles; and Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s opposition to the &quot;western front &quot; policy of the successive Comman ders- i n - Chief and the Chiefs of the General Staff, and the pressure he exerted, again against responsible British military opinion, in favour of -operations in Italy, the Balkans and Palestine, have all been strongly criticised. There are, of course, two sides to this as to every question. But to place the whole of the planning organisation in peace and war under the chairmanship of a Minister (who may often perforce be one with little or no experience and possibly of no aptitude) would certainly arm the critics with a powerful weapon of Which, as time goes on, they would not hesitate to make use in order to belabour the Government. Serious planning was not begun by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee until after the Prime Minister had resumed the Chairmanship of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1925, and they were encouraged to meet alone. Within two years they had established their&apos;own Joint Planning Sub-Committee,,        Criticisms of the System. Proposed.24. By far the gravest Objection to the system now proposed by the critics is that it involves dual control, not only between the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence, but between the Minister of Defence and&apos;the Fighting iService Ministers. Dual control was the: rock: on which Mr. Asquith and Mr. Lloyd George split in December 1916. Mr. Lloyd George wanted to take the Chair at the day-to-day work of the War: Committee, (the Committee of Imperial Defence adapted to war conditions), leaving to Mr. Asquith the Cabinet
(including the right to attend the War Committee on occasions) and the leader-ship of the House of Commons. In effect, Mr. Lloyd George would have been Minister of Defence. Mr. Asquith, with two and a half years&apos; experience of the war behind him, could not accept that situation. He realised that he would not be sufficiently saturated with knowledge of what -was going on. He could not accept dual control. And, when Mr. Lloyd George became Prime Minister, he presided regularly at the War Cabinet, though he delegated the leadership of the House of Commons to Mr. Bonar Law, who was a member of the War Cabinet.25. In the event of war or threat of war the military arrangements become a matter of the highest political importance. They engross the attention of the Cabinet and of Parliament. The Prime Minister must in that event take the matter in hand in person. In every democratically governed country throughout the Great War the Prime Minister of the day (in the U.S.A. the President) took the leading part in the higher control. It will be recalled also that, when the Italo-Abyssinian dispute reached an acute stage last August, and the Cabinet remitted it to the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements, the Prime Minister at once assumed the Chairmanship of that body, which was, in effect, discharging the functions of a War Committee, and has retained it throughout the crisis.   That is always likely to happen in times of crisis.26. If it be true that the Prime Minister must take command in war or in emergency, it would seem common sense that he must exercise control in peace time also in order to get to know the problems and the personnel of war. Inquiries such as those of the various Ministerial Committees dealing with Defence Requirements, and much of the work of the Committee of Imperial Defence itself must have a great educational value for a statesman, who, in the grim event of a resort to war, would find himself in a position of responsibility which he can never hope to delegate. For at these inquiries he must perforce study in considerable detail the strategical problems that would confront him in war.27. Apart from this it would be extraordinarily difficult to devise a chain of responsibility between the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence and the Ministers at the head of the Defence Services, which would not involve divided tontrcl in war, or friction in time of peace.28. For more than thirty years, in peace, in emergency and in the greatest war of history, the Prime Minister (with the exception of the years 1920-1925) had conducted the affairs of the Committee of Imperial Defence. Since January 1933 the Prime Ministers of the day have presided at over 100 formal meetings (apart from Cabinet meetings) dealing with defence questions, and this must have involved many informal consultations in addition. Unless, then, his pre-occupa-tions to-day are so great that he cannot undertake the overlordship of this vastly important section of the machinery of Government, there is everything to be said for his retaining it in his own hands.The Staff of the Committee of Imperial Defence.29. The proposal to strengthen the staff of the Committee of Imperial Defence is of a different order and deserves consideration quite independently of whether there is to be a Minister of Defence or not.30. The feature of the proposal which lays itself open most to criticism is the suggestion that a separate staff should advise the Committee of Imperial Defence independently of the General Staffs of the Defence Departments. This proposal, again, is open to the fatal objection of divided control. It is not clear who are to be the responsible advisers of the Government in war or in peace, the independent and separate staff of the Committee of Imperial Defence or the Government Departments who are responsible for action.31. &quot;I could find, a hundred ways of winning the war&quot; Sir William Robeitson once remarked to me apropos of some amateur proposal &quot;if I had not the responsibility for carrying them out.&quot; The truth is that in matters of war advice cannot be divorced from responsibility for carrying it out. That was where the system of permanent military advisers to the Supreme War Council at Versailles at first broke down.   The Commanders-in-Chief could not or would not
carry out their plans, and it was only after they became the mouthpieces of their respective Chiefs of General Staff that they were able to function more effectively.32. In the same way and for the same reason a group of staff officers attached to the Committee of Imperial Defence, however distinguished they might be, could not function effectively in time of war if they were independent of the Chiefs of Staff of the Navy,&quot;Army and Air Force. If that is true, it would be better not to have them in peace. But in reality they could not be independent for the reason that their hopes of advancement must lie with their own professions. There would be no independent career open to them under a Minister of Defence.. They would be a fifth wheel in the coach.33. Even in time of peace the system, as an advisory one, would be fraught with great difficulty and danger of friction. Plans must, above all things, be based on reliable intelligence and practicability of execution. The best intelligence and all expert information on means of execution is to be found in the Defence Departments, and, under the present system, is placed unreservedly at the disposal of the Committee of Imperial Defence and its Sub-Committees through the Departmental representatives. There is room for doubt as to whether in practice we could expect the same whole-hearted co-operation (often involving-very heavy work) on behalf of officers working in another Department on plans of which the Departments might or might not approve. Lord Milne&apos;s and Sir Ronald Charles&apos; remarks on this subject are much to the point.34. It is always possible, of course, if a second opinion is desired, to invite the Staff of the Imperial Defence College to submit an appreciation or to arrange some war game or other study of the subject. A recent appreciation of the Mediterranean situation, prepared quite independently by the Staff of the Imperial Defence College, revealed a striking general resemblance to the official appreciation. But this is a different thing from duplicating in the Committee of. Imperial Defence the work of the Service Staffs, which they would have to^ undertake in airy event, since responsibility for action rests with them.35. The Chiefs of Staff themselves have under consideration both the strengthening of the Joint Planning Committee and proposals by the Deputy-Chiefs of Staff for strengthening co-operation in intelligence. Their proposals should be awaited.&apos;36. Apart from the dubious proposals for a Minister of Defence and an independent operations staff at Whitehall Gardens, there are other directions in which an advance is desirable. The time is near when it would be very desirable to have appointed a senior officer as Deputy to the Secretary to the Committee, of Imperial Defence, a post that existed for some years after the war and was. dropped for reasons of economy. The Deputy Secretary would give his whole time to assisting and understudying on the defence side of the work the Secretary, who is also Secretary to the Cabinet and Clerk to the Council. The way has already been prepared for this. An additional Assistant Secretary has recently been appointed, and is assisting Colonel Pownall, the Senior Assistant Secretary, who, in consequence, is already able to devote most of his time to the work of assisting the Secretary, especially in the work of the Defence Policy and Require-meiits Sub-Committee, the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee and the Defence Requirements Committee. If a recognised Deputy Secretary were appointed the work could be reorganised with no delay at all.37. So far the Secretariat has never proved a &quot; bottle-neck &quot; in the work of the Committee of Imperial Defence Organisation, but we are working on a very narrow margin and a small increase in the Secretariat would be welcomed apart from the proposed Deputy Secretary.Supplies in War.38: So far nothing has been said in this memorandum on the question of supplies in time of War on which Lord Milne and Sir Ronald Charles rightly lay so much stress. This is admittedly the most unsatisfactory part of the whole organisation and causes me the gravest concern. Fundamentally, the cause is the former assumption of ten years of peace from any given date and the consequent lack of funds for this part of our war preparation. The more the matter is probed, however, the greater appears the magnitude of the task that lies, before us.
Summary.My conclusions can be summarised as follows :  1. The proposals of the critics are all open to the vital objection of divided control between :  (a) The Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence;(b) the Minister of Defence and the Ministers at the head of the Admiralty,War Office and Air Ministry respectively, and(c) the proposed independent joint advisory staff to the Committee ofImperial Defence and the General Staffs of the three Services.Such a system would be most dangerous in time of war and liable to create friction in time of peace. A proposal for divided control broke up the first (war) Coalition Government in December 1916. Divided control rendered the Council of Military Advisers at Versailles in 1917-18 ineffective until it was corrected. Divided control has been discarded in another sphere by suppressing the post of Minister for League of Nations Affairs.2. Our defensive organisation is a progressive one and has made great strides in recent years. The system has worked smoothly throughout the Abyssinian crisis as it did in the China crisis in 1927. Both in planning and action we were far ahead of any other nation in 1935 as we had been in 1927.3. Apart from crises such as those mentioned above the system appears to be working well; the main exception is on the question of supplies in time of war, and this is due not to defects in organisation but the results of Government policy in past years. To meet the resulting accumulated deficiencies, however, some strengthening of organisation may prove necessary, but whether in the Committee of Imperial Defence or in Government Departments, or both, it is as yet hard to say.4. Previous experience so far as it goes does not encourage the belief that any improvement would come from the appointment of a Minister of Defence. It might easily prove a retrograde step. Admittedly, however, these matters depend a good deal on personalities. The appointment of a Minister of Defence &quot;Would not stop criticism for more than a year or two, at most.    The mainSince this was written the D.P.R. Committee lias reported.-M. P. A. BE.30. The whole question has, of course, long been under consideration by the Principal Supply Officers Committee, who have reported the position in their annual reports to the Committee of Imperial Defence. With the appointment of a full-time chairman to the Supply Board these investigations are continuing energetically: The principles of War Expansion have come before the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee in connection with Defence Requirements.* The processes which have been carried out up to date have been mainly matters of enquiry and collection of information and planning. The stage on which we are now entering is different, involving executive and other action to get works and men ready to act On certain lines when the emergency arises; This is a much more difficult stage, and there is room for doubt as to whether the existing machinery is sufficient for the task, but whether it is the Principal Supply Officers Committee or Government Departments that require strengthening is hard to say.40. The responsibility for execution of whatever plans are approved rests with the Service Ministers and their respective departments, the machinery of the PrinciiDal Supply Officers Committee and especially of the Supply Board being available to them as required. I have absolutely no experience which entitles me to an opinion as to whether the Service Ministers would be helped by the addition of a Defence Minister, as proposed by Lord Milne and Sir Ronald Charles, or not. Again, the danger to be guarded against is dual control. This is the side, however, on which Imperial Defence as a whole is mainly in need of strengthening, whether it be in the Defence Departments or in the Committee of Imperial Defence. If we can get that right and sufficient funds are provided, we need not worry much about the remainder of the organisation.
advantage, would be to strengthen the Parliamentary representation of the-Committee, though there are other ways of providing for&apos;this: ;5. The Prime Minister, judging by the experience of all democratic nations, must take charge of a body that controls our effort in time of war. It is essential therefore that he should have an opportunity of familiarising himself in time of peace with the problems and the personnel of war. For more than thirty years (with one brief interval) the Prime Minister of the day has taken charge of defence co-ordination.6. The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee is working so well at present that it would be unwise to disturb it. As experience within the Service Departments shows, planning is much more a matter for General Staffs than for Ministers. The same principle applies to planning con-joint operations. Just as the Chief of Staff of each Service reports his plans to the Minister, so the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee report them to the Prime Minister (as well as to the Service Ministers) and at the Prime Minister&apos;s discretion to the Committee of Imperial Defence or Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee.7. In matters of war advice cannot safely be divorced from responsibility. The appointment of an independent staff under the Committee of Imperial Defence to advise the Committee involves divided responsibility for advice. It is therefore inadmissible in war and should not be adopted in peace.8. The strengthening of the machinery of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee is a question on which the Chiefs of Staff are about to submit advice.9. The early appointment of a Deputy Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence as well as the addition of one officer to work permanently on the Joint Planning Committee (as recommended by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee) is desirable.10. The weakest link in our defensive organisation is the matter of supplies in time of war. Pending further investigation by the Government, it is p re-mature to express an opinion as to whether a Minister of Defence would be helpful in that matter or otherwise. In any event there must be no divided responsibility. .11. The machinery by. which Government business is to be conducted must be a matter for the Government itself. When the subject is raised in the House of Commons and House of Lords, as is certain to happen, Parliament might be told of the new development of the Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee (which has not hitherto been announced) as well as something of the workings of our system during the present crisis. Presumably decisions as regards defence requirements will be announced in a debate. The objections to a Minister of Defence could be stated very fully and a statement could be made of any improvements to be made in such matters as supplies in time of war, the Joint Planning Sub-Committee and the strengthening of the Secretariat.(Signed) M.
