THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1936.SECRET. CP. 7   (36)CABINET.AFFAIRS IN KENYA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State, for the Colonies.THE perennial antipathy between Government and settlers in Kenya shows every sign of becoming acute in the near future, and unless the situation is carefully handled there is a possibility of serious trouble.2. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that the root of the discontent is economic. Like his fellows in every agricultural country, the European farmer in Kenya has been hard hit by the fall in world prices. In 1933 he received only  38 for as much of his four main products as would have realised  100 in 1928; and the value of some commodities, notably coffee, has since still further declined. In addition, the East African farmer has had his peculiar troubles in the shape of locust ravages and drought, which have prevented him from compensating by increased production for the fall in values of his produce. He has looked with a jealous eye at his neighbours in South Africa, where the agriculturist has been heavily subsidised out of the surplus profits from the Rand; and even at the farmer in the United Kingdom, who has received a measure of Governmental support impossible in a country like Kenya, which has no resources other than those derived, directly or indirectly, from the depressed agricultural industry itself.3. It is not surprising, therefore, that, with some fortunate exceptions, the Kenya settler feels that his hopes of assured prosperity are ruined and that chances even of his recovery are small; nor is it without parallel in other times and countries that he should blame Government for the acts of God, and find an outlet for his despair in levelling bitter charges of apathy and malevolence against Government House and the Colonial Office. A very vocal minority who unfortunately have the support of the local press have been very active in agitation and an undue measure of publicity has thereby been given to extreme views. At the same time there is no doubt that there are many cases of real hardship among the settlers and it is only natural that their grievances should be laid at the door of the Government.4. The settlers&apos; widespread feelings of grievance received emphatic expression at a recent meeting of the Convention of Associations (sometimes known as the Settlers&apos; Parliament) in Nairobi. The delegates at the Convention endorsed a statement drawn up by their leaders containing a long list of specific complaints and demands. With most of these I need not trouble my colleagues. In the case of a few of them I may be able to take action which will go some way to meet the settlers&apos; case, and which may partially reassure them of the sympathy with which His Majesty&apos;s Government regard their difficulties. I feel that this is necessary in view of the deep disappointment which probably awaits the settlers on the question with which this paper is principally concerned.5. To recapitulate the settlers&apos; principal grievances : Government is accused of (a) doing nothing to keep the farmer on the land; (&amp;) failing to reduce the heavy burden of indebtedness, public and private, under which the country labours; (c) maintaining, from the proceeds of excessive taxation, a costly administrative[12425]Copy No.
machine out of all proportion to the country&apos;s needs and capacity; (d) resisting the white settler5s aspirations to a greater control of the Colony&apos;s affairs, and his desire to be joined in a closer union with the neighbouring territories of Tanganyika and Uganda. Finally, Government is blamed for a delay in securing statutory permanence for the &quot; privileged position &quot; of Europeans in the Kenya Highlands.6. With regard to these matters (a) it is generally admitted that European agriculture must remain, at any rate for some years to come, the mainstay of Kenya&apos;s economic position. To assist the two thousand white agriculturists to maintain their out-put of exportable products Government has taiken every step that was reasonable and that iay open to it with its severely limited resources. A large part of the available cash balances has been advanced on very easy terms to assist the agriculturist: and cheap capital has been provided to the extent of  500,000 through the agency of the Land Bank. The Colonial Development Fund has advanced no less than  132,000 on generous terms to assist a number of projects which will be of direct benefit to European industry in Kenya. The Customs tariff is so adjusted as to provide every legitimate protection and assistance to the settler (some, indeed, contend that it goes too far in this direction), and the same may be said of the rating system of the railway. The settlers are now asking for further assistance from the Land Bank, and their proposal has been recommended by the Administration. I am at present examining, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the possibility of providing under suitable conditions further substantial assistance for the funds of that Institution. If this can be arranged, it will not only be of considerable economic assistance to deserving settlers, but will have a substantial political value.(6) The public debt of Kenya is admittedly onerous, but the greater part of it is a charge on the Railway. When the loans were raised the terms were not excessive and, indeed, the first loan (six per cent.) was not a market success. An exhaustive analysis carried out with the conjunction of the Treasury and the Bank of England has shown that relief before the dates when the various loans mature can be obtained only by imposing a wholly disproportionate capital burden on future generations, or by frank repudiation. Similarly, the individual producer cannot lightly escape from the burden of mortgages and other private obligations gaily incurred in more prosperous clays. The remedy suggested for this and. other handicaps by a majority of the Convention is the desperate device of devaluing the local currency in terms of sterling. There is nothing that we can do to meet the colony&apos;s and settlers&apos; difficulties under this head.(c) The administrative machine a legacy from more prosperous times-is admittedly expensive; though even now the Kenya Civil Servant is treated less generously than his colleagues in the other British territories in Africa. But since the beginning of the depression the costs of Government have been repeatedly overhauled and very substantially reduced; and my predecessor recently appointed Sir Alan Pirn (whose name was suggested by the settlers themselves) as an independent Commissioner to undertake the double mission of enquiring into the expenses of administration and advising on the possibility of taxation relief. There is evidence that this appointment has done something to mollify the settlers, though whether Sir Alan Pirn can make any practical recommendations which will be helpful remains to be seen. Even if he cannot, there will be advantage in having a report to that effect from an independent authority virtually of the settlers&apos; own choosing.(d) With regard to the questions of greater control by the settlers of the Colony&apos;s affairs, and closer union with the neighbouring territories, my predecessor recently addressed a despatch to East Africa in which he rejected in reasoned terms the claims put forward by a conference of &apos;&apos; unofficials&apos;&apos; of Kenya and Tanganyika. He based his answer on the arguments and conclusions of the Joint Select Committee of 1931. There is reason to believe that the settlers even in Kenya do not consider the question of Closer Union as one of immediate importance. &amp;7. Finally I come to the question of the European Highlands. It is over this that a storm may possibly break. The settlers have been assured, and I am prepared to repeat the assurance, that there is no present intention of departing from the administrative practice of the last thirty years, whereby the Highlands are reserved exclusively for white settlement.
The Morris Carter Commission in its report made two points regarding this territory. They first defined geographically the area in which Europeans should enjoy a &quot; privileged position &quot; and, secondly, recommended that these geographical boundaries should be &quot;safeguarded by an Order in Council, so that the European community may have the same measure of security in regard to land as we have recommended for the natives.&quot; In their summary of recommendations the Commission also recommended &quot;that the external boundaries of the European Highlands be defined in the Order in Council, and be subject to analogous safeguards as to exclusions, additions and exchanges &quot; as were recommended in the case of the Native Reserves. .,The settlers urge that the Order in Council should give statutory effect to the administrative practice referred to above.In the White Paper of 1934 (Cmd. 4580), it was stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government accepted the Commission.^ recommendations in regard to the boundaries of the Highlands, and approved the recommendation that the boundaries should be declared by Order in Council, in order to give added sense of security in that these boundaries could not thereafter be altered by local Ordinance.There is nothing in this which could be construed as an undertaking that His Majesty&apos;s Government should meet the settlers&apos; demand in full. I would propose to adopt the Carter recommendations, but otherwise not to go beyond a reaffirmation of the time-honoured administrative practice. In my view this would meet the legitimate claims of the European settlers for security in the Highlands.To go further and give statutory effect to the administrative practice would not only antagonise a large body of responsible opinion in this country; it would also meet with most determined resistance from the Government and people of India, who are interested from, the point of view of the Indians in Kenya. Sir Joseph Bhore raised the matter when he was in this country earlier in the year, and my predecessor had conversations regarding it with the Secretary of State for India. Whilst it would appear that the Indian people and Government are prepared to acquiesce in the existing practice, they would denounce any statutory perpetuation of what they regard as racial discrimination. I need not go into the arguments which they bring forward, which seem to me to have great force.8. The reaction of the unofficial community in Kenya to an announcement conveying that their wishes in regard to the Highlands cannot be fully met is not difficult to predict. The Governor (who can be relied upon to handle any situation which arises with patience and determination) advises me that they are feeling extremely strongly on the question, and that the only uncertainty attaches to the lengths to which they will be prepared to go in their opposition. There is wild talk in some quarters of such measures as organised passive resistance to taxation (an example which other elements in the Colony might not be slow to follow). Before announcing the decision which I have reached on the matter, and which I am convinced is inescapable, I have thought it well to acquaint my colleagues of the consequences which it may arouse. I would add that I do not propose to make any announcement until the troublesome Budget debates in the Kenya Legislative Council are over. Sir Alan Pirn has finished his enquiries, and I may have been able to take action in other matters, e.g., regarding the Land Bank, which will help to sugar the settlers&apos; pill. But in the meantime I ask for the Cabinefs authority to prepare the necessary Order in Council on the limited lines which I have proposed above.(Initialled) J. H. T.Colonial Office, Downing Street, January 13, 1936.
