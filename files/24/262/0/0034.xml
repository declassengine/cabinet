Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    WITH reference to the memorandum CP. 135 (36), which I circulated tomy colleagues on the 9th May, I attach as Annex I an extract from a telegramfrom His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Jedda (Sir  A. Ryan&apos;s telegram No. 63 of the13th May), showing that  the  Italian Minister at  Jedda has paid a  visit toKing Ibn Saud and that His Majesty is still nervous of possible Italian aggression against the Yemen.    2.   I also  circulate  as  Annex  II  to  my  colleagues  herewith  a briefsupplementary memorandum prepared in  the Foreign Office commenting on this telegram.                                                                   A.  E.    Foreign Office, May 25, 1936.ANNEX I.              Sir A. Ryan to Mr. Eden. (Received May 13.)(No.  63.)                                              y    &apos;(Telegraphic.)   Extracts.                             Jedda, May 13, 1936.    1.   MY Italian colleague  visited  Ibn Saud at his camp up  country on10th May  in  accordance  with an  arrangement  of which  Yusuf  Yasin had previously informed me privately.   Ostensible object was merely to pay respectsas owing to his recent absence he  had not seen the King for a long time.  TheKing bad agreed to audience only after repeated requests.   Arrangements were those usual in the case of formal [group omitted].    2.   Yusuf Yasin has given me an account of what passed.  Italian Charged&apos;Affaires spoke of facilities afforded to Moslems in occupied parts of Abyssiniabefore pilgrimage and of happy future  awaiting Moslems there; of  Italian mis-givings  about Saudi-Iraq Treaty (see my  telegram No. 55); of  offer of aircraft,which he again described  as wholly disinterested; and of  proposed renewal of      8617  [13261]
Italo-Yemen Treaty.  The King replied politely, but in general terms only on thefirst and fourth subjects. He repeated what Yusuf Yasin had  already said aboutSaudi-Iraq Treaty.        ******    5.   In still more private and  personal  conversation  as between friends,Yusuf  Yasin again voiced the King&apos;s fears of Italian policy in Red Sea  and possible aggression against the Yemen.  I expressed generally  reassuring views.ANNEX II.                               MEMORANDUM.                    Possible Italian Designs on Arabia.    THE information in Sir A.  Ryan&apos;s telegram  No.  63 does not appear to necessitate any  modification  in  the  views  expressed  in the  Foreign office memorandum C.P. 135 (36) as regards Italo-Saudi relations.    2.  It may  be, however,  that Ibn Saud has some  slight justification forincreased nervousness as to possible Italian designs on the Yemen. It still seemsimprobable that the Italians would embark on such an  adventure;  but it  isdifficult to prophesy about people  in such an abnormal state of mind as signor mussolini is in to-day, and it is conceivable that, having a large and powerfularmy  in Abyssinia,  Signor Mussolini  might throw caution to the  winds and,relying on our supposed  reluctance to  embark on a conflict  with him, pick aquarrel with the Imam and try to conquer the Yemen.  Such an adventure mightbe tempting for  three reasons :  (i) because the Yemen is by far the  most fertileand potentially rich part of Arabia; (ii) because the conquest of the Yemen wouldgive Italy effective control of the  Red Sea and set her astride our main line ofImperial communications;  and (iii) because  Signor Mussolini might cherish thehope that such an indirect method of attack against British interests would notnecessarily provoke a  war with this country, particularly if he is under theimpression that we are reluctant to face a conflict.    3.  The fact that this risk exists even in so comparatively remote a form is perhaps a further argument  in  favour of the early conclusion of some  arrange-ment for mutual assistance in the Eastern Mediterranean on the lines which haverecently been under discussion.  The situation does not, however, appear to have changed sufficiently since the memorandum in CP. 135 (36) was prepared  tojustify any fundamental revision of its general conclusions.Foreign Office, May 23, 1936
