y  &amp; i I    DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY13 GOVERNMENT *J3RET. .P.  157(56).m-                                              COPY NO.   ^                        CABINET.           EFFECT OF SANCTIONS ON UNITED KINGDOM TRADE.         Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     While I recognise that a decision in the matter of thewithdrawal or maintenance of sanctions must be taken primarily on political, grounds, I feel it necessary to point out that thetrade interests of this country are seriously involved.     United Kingdom exports and re-exports to Italy in 1934were valued at nearly  11 million or 4 per cent, of all our exports to foreign countries;  even in 1935 the corresponding figure was over  8 million or over 3 per cent, of all exports toforeign countries.   This trade has now fallen away to negligiblefigures and the gravity of the situation is increased by thefact that of the lost exports&quot;, over one-third consisted of coal,by far the greater part of which was supplied by South Wales andthe North-East Coast - especially the former, a depressed areawhose coal industry has derived little benefit in other directions from our trade agreements.   In South Wales the changed situation has been reflected by a decline in the tonnage of coalexported from that district in the first quarter of this year,amounting to nearly one-fifth of its exports in the same periodof 1935,  with,  of course,  a corresponding increase in unemployment and distress.    Practically the whole of this is attributable tothe loss of trade with Italy.   His Majesty&apos;s Government arebeing strongly pressed in consequence to take some special actionto assist South Wales.     It is true that this  loss is not wholly or even mainly  dueto sanctions,  but arose in the first place from paymentdifficulties.    Nevertheless, Italy has met her coal requirements
 of  late  by means  of  greatly  increased imports of German coal, which, thanks  to  the position  it  is now establishing for itself and to  political favouritism may well succeed in permanently wresting from this country the greater part of the Italian market.  - The risk of such permanent displacement greatly  increases the longer sanctions last and the more Italian  illwill is incurred.   Moreover, restoration of South &quot;Tales&apos; position cannot be looked for unless the Italian market is regained, since there are virtually no other outlets left which are capable of appreciable expansion.     In  other  items  of our export trade also, besides coal, there is a. serious risk that with the continuation of sanctions our &quot;non-sanctioniat&quot; competitors will be able to entrench themselves more and  more firmly in the Italian market.     Further certain of our industries are suffering somewhat from the cutting-off of supplies of certain raw materials which they formerly  obtained from Italy and which cannot readily be obtained elsewhere (e,g, pumice and sulphur).     Moreover, there  are frozen debts due from Italy to this countiry to an amount which can hardly be less than  2-g- million and may  possibly be as much as  3-g- million.Much of this has been outstanding for lengthy periods and some of it for well  over a rear.    There is of course no prospect of recovery  of any substantial part of this amount while sanctions continue and indeed any satisfactory arrangements for its recovery will at best be very  difficult to achieve,  even with the removal of sanctions,  A substantial part of  this money is due to coal exporters and some of the smaller South -Tales firms are in an exceedingly difficult financial position.
     As a result of sanctions and Italian economic andfinancial difficulties combined, a fairly flourishing trade hassunk in &quot;both directions to complete insignificance.   The declinedisclosed by the trade figures is not the full measure of ourloss, since important ancillary services, such as british shipping, have suffered correspondingly0     Moreover, the loss of trade due to sanctions has become the subject of growing demands for compensation from the UnitedKingdom traders affected, who point out,  with some show ofreason, that their losses have been occasioned by the actionof H.M. Government undertaken with political objectss and thatin these conditions it is not just that they, constituting onlyone small section of the community, should alone pay the cost.They are able to point their argument by reference to theassistance in respect of sanctions which the Government haveaccorded to Yugoslavia.  So far all claims of this characterhave been rejected, but if sanctions are to be continuedwithout any definite prospect of termination, they will be renewed with increasing vigour and the creditors who are unableto recover their debts from Italy will no doubt join in thedemand.     There will have been some increase of sales of 3ritish goodsboth  in the home market and in foreign markets from whichItalian goods have been excluded by sanctions, but a largeproportion of Italian exports are not competitive with UnitedKingdom products, and any gain in this respect is not likelyto have been very large.     Even if sanctions were terminated in the early future.the task of restoring Anglo-Italian trade would presentgreat difficulties and take a long time:   these
     difficulties will undoubtedly become more serious the longer-     sanctions continue, and I would once more emphasise that,     failing their withdrawal, I see no prospect of bringing about     any alleviation in the position of the South Wales coal     industry.          It is perhaps desirable in conclusion to utter a warning     against the idea that satisfactory terms for the resumption of     trade and settlement of debts could be secured by means of     &quot;collective negotiations&quot; between the sanction-applying     countries, as a bloc,  and Italy.  The complicated and detailed     problems that will arise can only be settled satisfactorily     by means of bi-lateral negotiations.  The most that could be     hoped for from preliminary collective negotiations, if such are     found feasible at all, would perhaps be  some recognition by     Italy, on paper at any rate,  of the  face value of her frozen     debts, and possibly also undertakings on her part in respect     of one or two other matters,  such as an  undertaking not to     allow actions to be pursued  in her Courts against British     traders for breaches of contract occasioned by sanctions.                                           W.R.Board of Trade,     8th June,  1936.
