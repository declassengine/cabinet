CABINET                      INDIA        Appreciation of the Political Situation,  bythe Government of India, dated 18th May,  1936.        Circulated for the information of the  Cabinetby the Secretary of State for India,
CONFIDENTIAL APPRECIATION OF THE POLITICAL SITUATIONIN INDIA,  DATED THE 18th MAY 193 6,  ISSUED ON THE  AUTHORITY OP THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.1.       Political interest during the past month hasconcentrated on the Lucknow Congress.  Two questionsappeared likely to cause a split in- the Congress ranks, thefirst, that of acceptance of office, the second, the extremesocialist policy enunciated hy the President, Pandit .J.L.Nehru.  On the first question, the President expressed himself in no uncertain terms.  &quot;To accept office and ministry under the conditions of the Act is to negative ourrejection of it and to stand self-condemned.  Nationalhonour and self-respect cannot accept this position, for it would inevitably mean our co-operation in some measurewith the repressive apparatus of imperialism and we wouldbecome partners in their repression and in the exploitation of the people&quot;.  In spite of this, a compromise was effectedbetween this view and that in favour of acceptance put forwardprincipally hy Madras representatives and it was resolved toleave the question to he decided at the proper time, whichwould presumably be after the first election by the All-india congress Committee, after consultation with ProvincialCongress Committees.         There is good reason to believe that this solutionof a difficult, problem was proposed hy Mr.  Gandhi himself,who, though taking no open part in the proceedings,  playedan important part behind the  scenes both during the  sessionitself and at subsequent meetings  of the working committeein reconciling conflicting interests.   Mr.  Gandhi is thusstill the director of Congress and has lost none of  his political astuteness  or of his inveterate  hostility  to
British rule.2.    Pandit J.L. Nehru in his presidential speech alsogave prominence to his views on socialism.  Apart fromnumerous references to the happy conditions in Soviet Russia,he explained that he used the word socialism not in a vaguehumanitarian way by in the scientific economic sense, and added, &quot;I see no way of ending the poverty, the vastunemployment, the degradation and subjugation of the indian people except through socialism.  This involves vast andrevolutionary changes in our political and social structure,the ending of vested interests as well as the feudal andautocratic Indian State system.      That means the ending of private property except in arestricted sense&quot;.   Such a clear enunciation of policyaroused considerable opposition both in Congress itself and in the Nationalist press and it is significant that thoughthe draft resolution on the agrarian policy of Congressreferred to the abolition of land-lordism, the finalresolution was much more moderate.   It merely stated thatpoverty,  unemployment and indebtedness were due to antiquatedand repressive land tenure and revenue systems and that thefinal solution of this problem involved the removal ofBritish Imperialistic exploitation and a thorough changeof land tenure and revenue systems.   What change was neededwas not indicated,  and again the issue was postponed byleaving it to the provincial Committees to examine thewhole question and to pay special attention to certain specified points which affect the interests and well-beingfflf the agricultural population.      Most of these are matters  which have received much attention from all  Local Governments,  not merely recently,
 but  in the more distant past, but it  is  clear that enquiries into these grievances by Congress workers, some holding very advanced socialistic views, will tend to create widespread agrarian discontent and possibly even that semi-revolutionary situation which Nehru regards as essential for attainment of the main item in his programme, the appointment of  a constituent assembly.  The adoption of this policy gives Nehru time to work up his organisation and the opportunity of doing so under cover of bona fide election  activities.  He is clearly not anxious at this stage to  provoke a breach with those representatives of vested  interests who in the past have supported Congress, and it is significant that in speeches delivered since the  Lucknow Congress he has  said little about socialism and has contented himself with advocating the formation of village committees (which may develop into Soviets) and  of unions of peasants. 3.    Of the other resolutions passed by Congress, one condemned in toto the new constitution while another criticised in detail the repressive policy of Governmentwhich it was contended deprived persons of civil,  ifnot personal,  liberty.   Congress are anxious to make capital out of their cry of repression and this is in accordance with the  policy adopted by their represent- atives in the Assembly to which reference has been made in previous appreciations.   In particular,  they areattempting to create public feeling over arrest ofSubhas Bqse under Regulation III immediately on his returnto Inuia,  but in Bose&apos;s native province of Bengal  verylittle live interest has so far been shown and meetingsheld both there  and elsewhere have not attracted attention.4.    His  Excellency the Viceroy&apos;s broadcast address
        i b idelivered immediately after his assumption of  office has been well received in the  press  but  it is  as yet too early to estimate its effect on the  rural  population.
