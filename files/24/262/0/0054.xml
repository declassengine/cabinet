THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 164 (36).CABINET.CONVERSATION  BETWEEN  THE  SECRETARY  OE  STATE   FOR    FOREIGN AFFAIRS  AND THE HON.  O.  PIROW, MINISTER OF    DEFENCE  IN THE  UNION  OF  SOUTH AFRICA.    I  CIRCULATE a  record  of  a conversation on  the  9th June  between mr. Pirow, the Lord Privy  Seal and myself, which I think will be of interestto my colleagues.                                                                   A. E.    Foreign Office, June 12, 1936.Record  of  a Conversation between the Secretary of State  and Mr. Pirow on                               June 9, 1936.    MR. PIROW came to see me this evening.   In the course of a conversation.of an hour&apos;s duration, during the greater part of which Lord Halifax was also present,  we discussed the future of sanctions in  connexion  with the Italo-Abyssinian  dispute and the German problem.    In  respect of the former, Mr. Pirow declared that his  Government wishedto keep  sanctions on for the time being  in the hope that it would be possible toobtain from Signor Mussolini some contribution toward a settlement of  the african problem.  The League could say, for instance, we had put on sanctionsto save  Abyssinia;  that part of our objective we had failed to realise, and  theEmperor was no longer on his throne, but the Abyssinians remained and we hadan obligation towards them.  We ought to keep on sanctions until that obligationwas fulfilled.   After some  discussion,  Mr.  Pirow  admitted that this  policyamounted to asking  the League to keep  on sanctions  in  order  that signor mussolini might be induced to accept something in the nature of the obligations of a mandatory towards Abyssinia,  I pointed out to Mr.  Pirow that I thought this was hardly a policy which would appeal to the League.  Few of the powers were actively interested in Africa, and  there would  also  be  active opposition I felt sure to any attempt to  recognise  what Signor Mussolini was  doing in abyssinia.   Mr.  Pirow, however, persisted that he thought it better for  theauthority of the British Commonwealth in Africa to maintain this attitude evenif as a consequence sanctions petered out, rather Jhan to agree to raising them at the next meeting of the League.    We then spoke of Germany.  Mr. Pirow stated  that on  the information inpossession of the South African Government he was not optimistic of the natureof the reply which we should get from Germany.   He thought that germany might be willing  to1 come to an arrangement in the West,  but only if we  wouldgive her a free hand in the East.  He explained that by this he meant a free handin respect of the&apos;Baltic States.  Mr. Pirow did not seem to feel much sympathy      8661  [13349]
for the fate of these small countries if they were swallowed up by Germany.  Heargued  that  if  Germany was not  given  an outlet anywhere then there musteventually be an explosion. ..  Mr. Pirow said he was going to Stockholm, but that he did not want to goto Berlin if he could avoid it, unless it were possible for a British Minister to bethere at the same time.  If this were possible, then he would be very glad to havean opportunity for having conversations with German Ministers, but he did not feel that, as a Minister of the Union, he would be justified in discussing in Berlinwith  the  German  Government matters of  policy which  might  affect the UnitedKingdom.    Mr. Pirow explained to us that his anxiety to  bring Italy into an AfricanConference was a desire to obtain something in the  nature of  a permanent settlement for that continent.  For that reason he wished Germany to attend theConference, because he considered that  Germany might be met  in her colonialdemands now, but that this would not be possible a year hence.  When questionedas to  how Germany was to be met, Mr. Pirow was emphatic that Germany wason no account to be given back Tanganyika or to have any colony on the east coast of Africa; the  presence  of  both  Hitler and Mussolini  on that  coast would be intolerable.  On the other hand, he thought that Germany might be  given  the cameroons and Togoland, and that possibly also  a small portion of Portugueseterritory in Angola could be ceded to her, in return for which we might transfersome portion  of  the Tanganyika mandate to Portugal.  An arrangement of thiskind,  Mr. Pirow thought, had some chance of being accepted  by Germany,  butif we  did not have our African conference  soon and get round a table about thisquestion, then Mr.  Pirow was convinced that the German appetite would so have grown that a demand for all the  German colonies would be made by  Flitlerhimself, and the  position would then become impossible.
