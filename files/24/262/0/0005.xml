THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the following papers :     Military Aspects              (Jk**e*eHa*^*^        Report by the Chiefs  of Staff Sub-Committee.             (C.I.D.

Paper No. 1232-B-^fe^b^feeatete^)    THE PRIME MINISTER welcomed the representatives of the dominions governments whose views on this problem were of  vital importance.    At  the  Prime Minister&apos;s request, MR. EDEN  summarised the  points  a tissue.    (i) Originally Sir Miles Lampson had been authorised to negotiate in  three stages, A, B and C. It was for consideration whether we should not now authoriseSir Miles Lampson to abandon stage C (Helouan) in view of Nahas Pasha&apos;s offer which referred to  road and railway  communications,  increased British troopsin the Canal Zone, power to reinforce at our discretion and air facilities.    (ii) The question of the inclusion of a  time limit in the Treaty.  In C.I.D.Paper No. 1232-B he had dealt with the question of the duration of a Treaty andthe legal position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in respect of the security of the suez Canal.  Our present legal position in Egypt, based on articles of the VersaillesTreaty and on the position enjoyed by Turkey under the Canal Convention, wasnot unassailable.  Previous Treaties had visualised  a time limit and the objectof the proposals put forward  in C.I.D.  Paper No. 1232-B was to improve ourlegal status  in Egypt as much as possible.  Instead  of  the time limit provisionsenvisaged in the 1930 Treaty the Foreign Office had suggested a Clause in theTreaty clarifying our position in  relation to the Suez Canal on the assumptionthat the vital interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government were recognised.    ADMIRAL SIR ERNLE  CHATFIELD pointed out that in their last report(C.I.D. Paper No. 1228-B) the Chiefs of Staffs had  recommended that  the positionof His Majesty&apos;s Government in respect of the  Canal should be clearly established,and that the time limit should  only refer to  other military aspects of the Treaty,i.e., the disposition and numbers of troops  other than those in the Canal Zone.      [13134]
2The proposals  of  the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs  regarding a time limit,  as  given in paragraph  20 of C.I.D. Paper No.  1232-B, seemed to be satisfactory,  but they were at  variance with the proposals  given in the  annex.thereto (Foreign  Office letter No.  J.  3027/G,  dated the  24th April,  1936).Referring to paragraph 6 of the Foreign Office letter, he said that it was neverintended that an outside body  (e.g., the League Council) should be in a positionto decide on numbers and the location of troops in the Canal Zone.  There shouldbe  no  limit as  to the troops required  to protect  the  Canal,  i.e., naval  forcesnecessary to keep  open  the communications or  the troops in  the  area to supportthe Navy in their task.     GENERAL  SIR  CYRIL DEVERELL  endorsed  Sir  Ernie  Chatfield&apos;remarks.  Paragraph 20 of C.I.D. Paper No. 1232-B was in general agreementwith the views of the Chiefs of  Staffs.  It was essential to ensure  the retention oftroops in the Canal area without any  question of our legal rights to be therearising.     MR. DUFF COOPER said there  was an  essential  difference between theForeign Office view, as put forward in paragraph 20 of C.I.D. Paper No. 1232-B,and that given in Foreign Office letter No. J. 3027/G, dated the 24th April, 1936.annexed  thereto.  The  former  contemplated a Treaty, one of the provisions ofwhich agreed to an examination of  the number of troops in Egypt, bearing inmind that the position of His Majesty&apos;s  Government in relation to the Suez Canalwas recognised, whereas in the latter it was suggested that after  a  period of&quot; x &quot; years not  only the number and disposition of troops in  the Canal Zone butthe  question whether British  Forces should remain in the Canal  Zone  at all should be referred to a body such as the League of Nations  for decision.  he asked whether we should put ourselves in such a position that this matter shouldbe referred to the League of Nations.  He considered that it  was a matter for settlement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Egyptian Government.     MR.  EDEN  explained  that  paragraph 6 of the letter under   referencesuggested a method of  approaching  to  a revision of the question.  It  would benecessary to have the principles of the legal rights of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto the Canal agreed in the Treaty, and other matters such as location and numbersof troops could be referred to the League should the need arise.     LORD SWINTON remarked that it was  not impossible that the Leaguemight give a decision that the  Egyptian Army was so strong that there was no need to locate British troops in the Suez Canal zone.  Referring to the time limitin the 1930 Treaty, he said that the Chiefs of Staff had not had any opportunityof expressing their opinion of the military aspects of this Treaty.     DR.  PAGE summarized the  views of the Australian  Government  on theAnglo-Egyptian Treaty.  He felt that  the New Zealand position must be very similar to that of Australia.  Australia regarded communications with  GreatBritain as perhaps the  most vital factor in Empire defence.  If  the strength ofthe British Empire  was to be  the best  guarantee of peace, increased Dominionstrength could  not&quot;  compensate for  weakness  on  the lines  of communications.Whilst anxious to improve our position in Egypt as suggested  by the ForeignOffice  we should be cautious not  to  make  worse  our position in that country.Unless they were  satisfied that the communications through Egypt were assuredin perpetuity, the Australian Government would prefer to  have no Treaty at all,nor would they  be satisfied with a revision of the Treaty by an outside  body likethe League  of Nations.  The attitude  of certain countries, members  of theLeague of Nations, might be at variance with  the policy of the British Empire.At the present time the position of the League of Nations was not such as to giveconfidence; Australia would not endorse any policy giving  that body  power to revise an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, in fact there would be considerable  resent-ment to such action, and the Dominions would feel that their war effort  had been&apos; thrown away.  He could not understand the continual reference to the 1930 draft treaty, which  had neither been ratified nor accepted as a basis  for the present negotiations.  The negotiations should now proceed on a realistic basis.     MR. TE WATER, whilst appreciating  the dilemma in which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  was placed on the present negotiations, said that he spoke without
instructions of his Government on this question.  He was, however, acquainted with their general view.  Open communications from South to North were vital to the Union of South Africa.  This issue appeared to be at stake.  A treaty with Egypt safeguarding communications would be  acceptable to South Africa,but a Treaty which after  a period of years led to the weakening of the safeguardsof our communications would not be acceptable.  The position of South Africawas not quite analogous  to that  of Australia,  for South  Africa was concernednot only.with the safeguarding of the Suez Canal, but with the position  of theUnited Kingdom in Egypt.  It would always be necessary to have some point inEgypt where the power  of Great Britain  was  stabilised.   South Africa  also attached importance to the  necessity for a friendly Egypt.    In the ensuing discussion ME,. EDEN referred  again to the difficulties ofour position in Egypt.  Even  if we had no Treaty, this fact would not guarantee in perpetuity the security of our communications.  In many respects we had now reached  a better position in the present negotiations than that envisaged  in the1930 Draft Treaty.  Previous Treaties, i.e., the Chamberlain-Sarwat Treaty of1928 and the 1930 Draft Treaty had visualised a time limit.   In the former theLeague of Nations had been given the power to decide on the location of Britishtroops after a period of  10 years.  It was most unusual for Treaties to be ofperpetual duration.    Without a Treaty our  position in Egypt would  not be satisfactory.   Therewas evidence of increased Italian activity and anti-British  propaganda  in Egypt.That country had suggested a non-aggression pact with Egypt.  Our position inEgypt  would  be strengthened by  a Treaty.   He  . appreciated,  however,  thedifficulties of reference to the League of Nations which had been referred to inthe discussion.    In reply to a  question by Sir John Simon  as to whether any other power could challenge our position in Egypt, he considered that whilst this was doubtful,Italy might be in a position to challenge us under the optional clause, and thatshe might, on some pretext or other, take us before  the Hague  Court  and thenchallenge our legal position,  raising at  the same  time  the  question of Britishtroops,  He considered that the proposals as set out in C.I.D. Paper No. 1232-Bshould  improve  our legal position in Egypt,  and ensure that  our  position inregard to our lines of communication was more satisfactory.  Our position  wouldbe weakened,  and it  might be said that we  were holding Egypt by force if negotiations broke down,  or we refused to submit to any reference  to the Leagueof Nations.    DR. PAGE raised the question of the position of  the British Empire vis-a-vis the League of Nations.  The  question of the Suez Canal was so important thatit was for consideration whether  we should support  a body the  action of  whichmight affect the position  of Australia and her communications with  the BritishEmpire.  He apprehended also that the negotiating of a Treaty by Egypt  might become a political  bone of  contention in that  commonwealth.   He felt strongly that our position vis-a-vis the League of Nations should be examined before  anyfurther action was taken.  He had grave doubts whether  our  position  in egypt would be improved by the existence of a Treaty.    LORD MONSELL, referring to the  safeguarding of our legal rights on the suez Canal  in perpetuity,  said that there  was  good reason  for separating the canal from other military considerations. Whilst Egypt might be able to developan army in, say, 20 years&apos; time, it was obvious that she  could never develop a Navy.He considered therefore  that we should  get special  treatment in regard to the canal.    He agreed with the view put  forward by  Mr.  Duff Cooper that  thequestion of British troops in Egypt was one for discussion between the  egyptian government and ourselves.    The position  of the British Empire without  thesecurity of the Suez Canal would be impossible.   We had now taken steps to dealwith the deficiencies of the  Defence Services and the only practical way to dealwith the problem would be  to refuse to let any  other Power  turn  us out of the canal once we had made ourselves strong.    MR. DUFF COOPER  said that  the Chamberlain-Sarwat  Treaty of 1928should be regarded as a warning.  We were prepared to enter into such a Treatyat that  time and he pointed out what a deplorable situation we should have found ourselves in, in view of  recent international events, had such a Treaty been

Referring to the political aspects of the problem, he said that when theTreaty came before the House of Commons it would come as a great shock to manyto find that we had agreed to abandon our position in Cairo.    THE PRIME MINISTER said that there was no question of locating troopssolely in the Canal  Zone.    He did  not consider it would be possible to get any Treaty through the Houseof  Commons  unless  it  contained  provisions  for  the  location  of  troops  at alexandria.   This  was an essential provision in the conclusion of any Anglo.Egyptian Treaty, on which we could not afford to give way.  He considered thatthe two weakest points were at present the question of the location of troops andthat of the revision of any Treaty by the League of Nations. It would be necessaryto examine  how far we  could safeguard our position  in relation  to  the Canalfor the future.    In  reply to a question by Sir Thomas Inskip, MR. EDEN said he did notconsider that there was any disposition on the part of Egypt to  deny the necessityof the Suez  Canal communications as a vital British interest.    SIR THOMAS INSKIP considered that if this was so we should endeavourto get a  dominating Clause in a Treaty on the  lines suggested in paragraph  20of C.I.D. Paper No. 1232-B regarding the vital necessity of  the Suez Canal toBritish  interests and then  agree  to the other minor  and subsidiary  military considerations being referred to the League at the end of a &quot;timedimit.&quot;    SIR JOHN SIMON suggested  that further consideration of the proposalsgiven in paragraph 4 of the annex to C.I.D.  Paper No.  1232  was  necessary,  asthey differed from  the proposals referred  to in paragraph 20 of C.I.D. PaperNo. 1232-B.    After further  discussion,  the PRIME MINISTER  summarised the viewsput forward at the discussion.  He  asked  the Foreign Secretary, in consideringhis advice to the Cabinet on the question of a timedimit, to take into account thediscussion summarised above.                            ...                                CONCLUSION.    THE COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed     (a)  That the retention of a British garrison on the Suez Canal and at or  in          the vicinity of Alexandria is essential.    (b)  That,  provided  we  can  secure   the  retention  of  British  troops  in          Alexandria and a  satisfactory solution  as regards time-limit, we          should not insist on the retention of troops in  Cairo.    (c)  That the arrangements for a time-limit as regards (i) Alexandria, (ii) the          Suez Canal (which are not necessarily the same) should be reserved for          consideration  by the Cabinet in the light of the discussion.   4&amp;                       $fc          $fa           $fa           vfe           %
