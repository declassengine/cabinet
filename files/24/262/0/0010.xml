              BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.               STATE OF TRADE - MARCH, 1956.        Summary of reports  sub&apos; It ted by members  of the      Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some      cases with statistical information from other sources).     OVERSEAS TRADE.   Imports in March at  68.1 m. were 7.5 m. more than in March, 1935.   Over 60;] of  the rise wasin food and raw materials.   Of the increase of  288 m. inmanufactured goods, nearly  1 m. related to oils, fats andresins and nearly  400,000 to machinery.  Exports of UnitedKingdom produce,  56.5. m., were  558,000 more and re-exports, 5.9&apos;^&apos;-, were  1.4 hi. more than in March, 1935.     EMPLOYMENT.   The total number of unemployed persons onthe registers at the 23rd March was 1,881,551, a decrease of143,490 as compared with 24th February.     The main variations vere:-London...........  -24,690    Nor&apos;th Eastern ...  -30,013South Eastern....  -17,105    Northwestern....  -22,231Southwestern....  -14,867    Scotland ........  -16,409Midlands ........  -19,626    Wales...........  -h 1,451     The estimated number of insured persons aged 16 - 64in emplo3mient was 10,630,000 which is 155,000 more than at24th February and 411,000 more than at 25th March, 1935.   Theimprovement since Februarjr was most marked in the buildingindustry;  there were also  substantial reductions in thenumbers unemployed in public works contracting,  stonequarrying, brick and tile making, iron and steel, engineering,motor vehicle, miscellaneous metal, clothing woollen and worsted, cotton, furniture, pottery and earthenware, printing,and food industries, the . transport and distributive trades,and hotel and boarding house service.  The numbers temporarily&apos;3.rilystopped in the coal mining  industry increased further.
     EAIL\^,mpTI^.  In the- five weeks ended 29th Marchrailway traffic receipts increased by  591,000 (2.89X0compared with the corresponding period of 1935.   Theincrease amounted to 1.25% in passenger traffic, 5.18?$ inrespect of merchandise, minerals and livestock and 1.81^ inrespect of coal, coke and patent fuel.-     SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING-. The Chamber of Shipping index number of freights (1913=100) was 89.19 as against 84,02 inFebruary and 75,5 a year ago.  On the 1st April 474,000 nettons of shipping were laid up at ports in Great Britain andIreland as compared with 425,000 on 1st January and 705,000 ayear ago.   The exceptional^/- poor demand for charter tonnage in distant markets may tend to increase the laid-up figures.     There has been a further improvement in the shipbuildingposition.  The amount of tonnage under construction in GreatBritain and Ireland at the 51st March was 842,000 gross tons as against 745,000 gross tons at the  .31st December and 555,000a year ago.     BANKING.  Money continued very plentiful throughout                                                 17.,March.  The Treasury Bill rate fluctuated around 52&apos;&apos; but fell to ^% on the 28th owing to heavy tendering for bills maturingon the 50th June.     The foreign exchange market was quiet.   The Dollar wassteady around 4.97 until the last week when it fell to about .95.   The franc continued to be affected by rumours of devaluation and by political uncertainty;  although the spotrate only moved between 74-f and 75, it is thought that thisdegree of steadiness was largely due to official support.The three months forward rate rose from l9/l6 to over 3 francsdiscount.     Gold prices fluctuated between 140/8d. and 141/2d. and silver prices between lql/1sd. and 203/I8d.                               -2-
    FINANCIAL CONDITION::; ABROAD.   The principal developmentdaring March was a sharp deterioration in the technicalposition of the Bank of France which was partly checked &quot;by arise in the hank rate to 5%.   The gold reserve position is however still very strong.     The position in Holland shows no improvement but theGovernment&apos;s financial difficulties are not of immediateconcern as in France.   The weakest feature is the financialposition of the municipalities and communes who have to sharewith the Government the cost of unemployment relief.    COAL.   The average weekly output of coal during the 13 weeks ended 21st March was 4,704,000 tons as compared with 4,515,000tons in the corresponding period a year ago - an Increase of4.255.  The average number of wage-earners employed was 1,2% lessthan a year before.     Exports in March amounted to 2,626,000 tons as comparedwith 3,198,000 tons in March, 1935.    There were no exportsto Italy which took 413,000 tons in March 1935.  Othercountries  taking reduced quantities included Egypt, denmark and Belgium.     IRON  AND STEEL.   Activity has been maintained and islikely to  continue for many months to cpme.     Pig iron output  (634,000 tons) was 14.3.% greater thanin March,  1935.   Most producers are sold ahead until the endof June and many even later.  Crude steel production (930,000tons - 16.4$ more than a year ago) reached a record.  Demandfor semi-finished material was not entirely satisfied even with additional  Continental supplies.   In the finished steelsection works are operating almost to capacity.   Export businesshas shown  some improvement.
    Scotland.  Both light and heavy industries are enjoying improved  conditions which are likely to continue for a considerable time.  Consuming industries are also fairly busy. Export business is more active.  Prices of raw material have increased and prices of finished products may rise shortly.     North East Coast.  Pig-iron continues in very strong demand.   It is expected that early steps will be taken to increase  output of foundry iron.  Steelworks remain extremely busy and  the outlook is very promising.  Semis continue in strong demand and producers have difficulty in maintaining deliveries.  The sheet department remains rather slack.     Sheffield.  Strong demand continued.  Output of basicbillets was very heavy.   All the finished steel departments were active, the output of stainless steel being particularlyheavy.  Railway material manufacturers have been busier than for some years.  Progress in expansion of steelworks equipment,especially furnaces, has been good.     South Wales.   Satisfactory developments continued.Good orders for all kinds of structural material have beenplaced.  The tinplate trade has been satisfactory;  greater freedom has been allowed in export sales, the Americanshaving considerably reduced their quota arrears.     ENGINEERING.   The level of activity in the industry has risen and the volume of new business and enquiries is increasing.    The marine engineering trades have recoveredappreciably in recent months.   There has been a revival inlocomotive and railway equipment construction both for homeand export markets.  All classes of  machine tools are instrong demand and many makers are working overtime.     Exports of machinery were valued at  3.5 m.  as  comparedwith  3.3 m. in March 1935.
      MOTOR INDUSTRY.   The number of motor  vehicles  newly registered in February was 29,723 which  is 4,767  more  than a year ago.   The increase in private cars  was  2,239.      The production of private cars and  taxis  in  January was 31,739 as against 30,539 in January  1935.  The  production of commercial vehicles increased from 8,880 to 10,236.      Exports of new private cars and chassis in March amounted to  4,839 and of new commercial  vehicles  and chassis to 1,110,  showing when compared with March 1935,  decreases of 18.2$ and 5.1$ respectively.   Imports of complete new private  cars and taxis amounted to  1,677,  10%  less  than a year  ago.      LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES.   Most  of the  light metal  trades continue busy and the less  busy sections show  an  improving tendency.  Non-ferrous metal mills  generally are  well  employed. In some  sections of the tool trades  demand  far exceeds supply.  Shortages  of labour persist in the  tools and  metal smallwares trades.  In the  lock  and  allied  trades wages havebeen  increased by about  5%.     ELECTRICAL  INDUSTRY.  All  sections of  the industry have maintained an  improved position.  The telephone manufacturing industry continue? extremely busy.  The index of heavyengineering  orders rose further.  Consumption  of electricityamounted to  1,753 in.  units, an  increase of 16.2^ overMarch, 1935.     COTTON.  There was no appreciable change in the positionof the industry  during March,  Average weekly deliveries ofraw cotton to  spinners were 27.6 m. lbs.  - the  same as  inFebruary.   Takings of American and Egyptian cotton declinedslightly but takings of Indian and other cottons increased.Raw cotton prices rose  substantially.  In the American  sectionspinners margins declined but in the Egyptian section theywere not much affected.                         -5-
      Yarn exports at  13.3 rn, lbs. were rather less than in February, but 1.7 m.  more than in March 1935.  Exports of piece goods at  173.3  m.sq,yds. were 3.8 m.sq.yds. more than in February, but 9,9  m.sq.yds. less than in March 1935;  as compared with February exports increased to Egypt (by 2 rn.sq,yds.) Switzerland, Colombia, Irish Free State and the Netherlands, but fell considerably to India, (by 2.7 m.sq.yds.) Denmark and Australia.      SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.  There has been little change in the rayon yarn trade but the position is expected to improve materially towards the end of May.  The hosiery and underwear trades are rather disappointing for the time of year. Business in piece goods has been quiet owing mainly to the cold weather.  Exports of all-rayon fabrics and of rayon mixture piece goods showed substantial increases over March 1935.     In general, the position in the silk trade remainsunsatisfactory.     WOOL.   There was an improvement in the general activity of the woollen and worsted sections during March.  Raw woolprices continued to  rise.  As compared with February exportsof tops increased but exports of yarns and tissues decreased.     General activity during the first quarter of 1936 was considerably greater than a year ago (when,  however, thenormal seasonal  improvement did not occur).   There are signs that the present activity may not be fully maintained.     HIDES  AND LEATHER.   Hide markets remained on the wholefairly steady in March.   The political situation still  preventedfree exports of  hides from most European countries.   In theleather industry there was a slight recession from the activityduring January and February.  Chrome calf tanners are planning to increase  production following the additional import  duty.
     CHEMICALS.  Home sales of alkalies equalled the satisfactory January rate and exports were more than inJanuary or February.  Deliveries of chlorine productsremained at a high level.  The improvement in deliveries of industrial nitrogen products was maintained.  Sales ofdye8tuffs were well in advance of those in March 1935.  Homesales of fertilizers are larger this season than last;  total exports are less though Empire sales have increased.  Demandfor coal tar and wood distillation products is satisfactory.     POTTERY.  Conditions remained slack in most sectionsof the pottery trade during February.  Demand for chinaware,however, was fairly good.   Exports in the first quarter ofthis year were higher in value than last year.     RETAIL TRADE.  The money value of retail sales inFebruary was 7.3/. greater than in February 1955-;  this increase was less than that for January (10.8$) or December (9.1%).All areas shared in the February improvement.  Sales offoods and perishables rose by 8.6/1 and of other merchandisehy 5.5$.  Preliminary returns for March show that theimprovement over last year has continued.     CANADIAN TRADE.  Economic conditions in February showedon the whole a further slight improvement,  Businessoperations declined, but exports were greater than in anyFebruary since 1930.  Copper and nickel exports were extremely high and mineral production showed greater activity.Newsprint production established a record for February.Iron and steel and automobile production declined.     AUSTRALIAN TRADE.  2,497,957 hales of wool were received into store from the 1st July, 1935, to the 29thFebruary last, as compared with 2,542,781 a year ago, the quantities sold or shipped being 2,166,936 and 1,746,745bales respectively.  V/heat and flour shipments from the                       -7-
1st December, 1935, to the 24th March were equivalent to43.9 m, bushels of wheat against 37,6 m, bushels a year ago.Butter exports from, the 1st July, 1935, to the 28th Marchamoxmted to 80,013 tons as compared with 97,552 tons a yearago,  Imports of merchandise during February amounted to 8,17 m, (Australian currency) as compared with  6,58 m, lastyear,     SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.  The Customs Tariff Commission has recommended, by a majority, that a duty of 25% ad valoremshould be regarded for general purposes as the limit of moderate protection.   Imports in January were 16.9% greater than in January,1935.   Exports (excluding gold) were 13.2fb more, due largely to increased wool exports and despite a heavy fall in maizeshipments.   Gold output was rather more than in January, 1935.The wool market remained firm during February, but cattleprices declined.   Expansion in the manufacturing and buildingindustries continued.     SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     Argentina.   The first official forecast of the 1935/36maize crop Indicates a smaller yield than last season.   Thewheat market has been very quiet as the Government1s minimum prices exceed world market levels.   The volume of wheatexports for the season up to 29th February was less thana quarter of that for the corresponding period of last  season,The wool market has been active and prices are firm.   It isreported that official exchange has been available for imports of Italian cotton and rayon goods.   The total valueof exports and imports for January and February was lift? and1.85? respectively less than in the corresponding -period of1935.
      Brazil.   The  coffee  market was quiet.  Shipments of coffee from  the  1st  July  to the 14th March were 27,5% greater than in  the  corresponding period for the 1954/35 crop.   The value of  exports and imports in January was 39% and  77.4% respectively greater than in January, 1935.  German trade  with Brazil  is reported to he increasing, mainly through the  operation  of the &quot;Compensation&quot; mark system.      Chile.  The wheat harvest is normal.  The value of imports, from Germany in 1935, as compared with 1934, showed a noteworthy increase.  No interest was paid in 1935 on  80 m. of the  95 m.  invested by British interests.     Peru. The sugar market has been steady and prices have improved.  Cotton  crop reports are favourable.   Cotton exports  to the United Kingdom declined considerably in 1955but  increased to Japan and Germany.  The total  value of imports  last year was nearly 6$,  and of exports -1$S, greater than in  1934.     Colombia. Coffee exports during January were considerably greater  in volume than a year before.   The value of coffeeexports  in the year 1935 was rather less than in 1934.Total  exports in 1935 decreased in value by 7.5$ but importsincreased by 22%.
