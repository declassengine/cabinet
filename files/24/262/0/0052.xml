COPY NO. 162 (36),-- 0 A B I NET...             THE CORONATION OATH..                0 PIN I 0 N          OF THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR       AND THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE  CROWN.           Since the form of the Coronation Oath is  laid down    hy statute i,s cannot he altered  without statutory authority.    But it has always been recognised that  if a statute  is    passed altering the constitutional position of this    country in such a way as to render the  words of  the  original    Oath  no longer applicable,  that  Act may be treated as    iiiipliedly authorising,  and  indeed requiring, a corresponding    alteration in the wording of the Oath.      This  procedure    was accepted both in the case of the Act of Union with    Scotland and the Act of Union with Ireland,        In our    opinion the Statute of  Westminster does alter the    constitutional position of  this  country In relation  to    the Dominions in such a way as to  render the existing    words of the Coronation Oath inapplicable.     It  follows    that  we think an alteration should be made  in the    wording of the Oath so  as to give  effect to  the  alteration    effected by the Statute of  Westminster  and that  that    Statute may properly be treated  as  an authority  for making    such  an alteration.      The e^cact wording  of the  revised    Oath  is a matter for careful consideration;  the revision    must  be limited to what is  necessary to  give effect to    the alteration in the constitutional position.
     No doubt we shall be informed of the words proposedto be substituted before they are finally approved.(Sighed).     I-IAZLSHAM.                    C              D.B. SOI.-ERVELLT.J. 0TCONNOR.House of Lords, S.17.1  12th June, 1936.-2-
