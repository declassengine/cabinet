(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY: OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .UJG RET.f;.F. 169.156) .CABINET.REPORT CP COMMITTEE ON THi^CORONATION OATH.1.   At their Meeting on May 29th, 1936, (Cahinet 4-0 (56)Conclusion 1), the Cahinet appointed a Committee composed as followsThe Lord President of the Council (in the Chair),The Lord Chancellor,The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,The First Commissioner of works,The Attorney-General,2.   The Cabinet had already, on May 27th, 1936, (Cabinet 39(56) Conclusion 3), invited the Lord Chancellor, the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General to prepare a written opinionon the question whether the Coronation Oath can be alteredwithout express legislation.   Their Report has since been circulated to the Cabinet (CP. 162 (36)).3.   The Coronation Oath is laid down in an Act of 1688(1 William and Mary, cap. 6).   Only the first part of the oath is now in question.   This part of the Oath has been modified from time to time without statutory authority, since it has always been recognised that if a statute is passedaltering the constitutional position of this country (e.g. theActs of Union with Scotland and. Ireland) that statute may betreated as authorising a corresponding alteration in the wordingwith the following Terms of References-H rpTo consider the terms of the Coronation Oathand the constitutional and other questions arising in connection with the associationof the Dominions in the Coronation ceremony.&quot;
4.   The relevant  portion of the Coronation Oath administered.to His late Hajesty was in the following terms.-          &quot;Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern           the people of this United Kingdom of Oreat .           Britain and Ireland, and the Dominions thereto           belonging, according to the Statutes in           Parliament agreed on,  and the respective laws           and Customs of the same?&quot; 5.   A  letter  dated May  1st,  1936, has been  received, from-Mr.  te  Water,  the High Commissioner for the  Union of South Africa, which  makes necessary the reconsideration of the position.   Briefly, the Union Government claim that the Oath as administered  in 1911 would appear to refer to the Dominions as territories subordinate to the United Kingdom, and is thus out  of  harmony with the new constitutional status of the British Commonwealth of Nations, as laid down in the Statute of Westminster.   After discussing the possibility of a separate Oath  being administered in respect  of each Member of the  Commonwea11h, the Union Government conclude that a collective Oath would be  more in keeping with the dignity of the Coronation ceremony, and  propose the following forms-          &quot;Y/ill you solemnly  promise and swear that you will           govern the people  of the United Kingdom of Great           Britain and Northern Ireland, of  the Dominion of           Canada, of the Commonwealth of Australia, of the           Dominion of New Zealand, of the Union of South           Africa, of the Irish Free State,  and of the           dominions respectively to each of these belonging,           according to the Statutes in the  parliament of           each of them agreed on and according to the           respective laws and customs of each of them?&quot; The  Union Government announce that they contemplate dealing with the  matter in  an Act of Parliament, in which the Governor-General would be empowered to authorise any -person to administer the Oath. It is intended, however, that the person authorised on the present occasion shall be the Archbishop of Canterbury.6,    We are reluctant  to recommend unnecessary  changes, but  itappears to us clear that a change  in the  first  part  of the Oathis  made necessary by the Statute  of Westminster0   On the other
hand, we dislike the provisions of the proposed South Africanlaw, and the terms of the collective Oath suggested &quot;by SouthAfrica,   We think that, if the United Kingdom were nov to consent to these proposals, it might find itself at a later stage regarded as committed to such undesirable constitutional developments as the &quot;six Kings&quot; theory.   Again, the SouthAfrican draft of the Coronation Oath would cause great difficultyat the present moment with the Irish Free State Government.7.  - Mr. te water has sent copies of the Union proposals to theother Dominions.   It is thus a matter of some urgency that amore appropriate form of the Coronation Oath should &quot;be approvedwithout delay, and transmitted to the Dominions.   If this isnot done soon, there is a danger that some o,f the other Dominionsmay propose to take action in accordance with the South. Africandraft.8.   The opinion of the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers ofthe Crown (CP. 162 (36)), while stating that, if legislation isto he avoided, the revision of the Oath now contemplated &quot;must helimited to what is necessary to give effect to the alteration inthe constitutional &quot;position&quot; effected by the Statute of Westminster,does not propose any alternative form of words.9.   It is moat necessary, in our opinion, not to follow theSouth African draft in referring by name to each Dominion.   Wehold the view that the best form of the Oath would be one whichshould mention by name no part of the Empire, except the UnitedKingdom.   The Secretary of State for India,  however,  hasrepresented that a mention of India is made necessary,  e.g.  by its unique size, and by the fact  that it is cited in-the RoyalTitle.    Having regard to the  views of the Secretary  of  State,we submit the  following draft  for the consideration of  the                            -3-
                                                            g -g fiCabinet i-                                                   *i A U        &quot;Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern         the people of this United Kingdom of Great Britain         and Northern Ireland, of your Dominions, of India,         and of your Territories and Possessions beyond         the Seas3 according to the respective laws and         customs of the same?&apos;1     As we point out above, however, it would not be indisaccord with our views if the Cabinet decided upon furtherconsideration to omit the separate mention of India..     We think that it is for the Cabinet to consider what is tobe the appropriate authority for advising the King as to thefinal form of the wording.  Under the procedure hitherto adoptedthis is a matter on which His Majesty might have been advised bythe Coronation Committee.  The altered constitutional positionsuggests that the matter is one which should be referred tothe Commission representative both of the United Kingdom and theDominions9.regarding which we made proposals in paragraph 12.We think, however, that our own view should be communicated with-out delay to the Dominion Governments for the reasons indicatedin paragraph 7.10.  We turn now to the second part of our Terms of Reference &quot;theconstitutional and other questions arising in connection with theassociation of the Dominions in the Coronation ceremony&quot;.     It was originally intended to follow precedent strictly asregards the procedure by which the general arrangements for aCoronation are conducted.  The normal practice is for a special meeting of the Privy Council (the &quot;Coronation Council&apos;&apos;) to be held,at which the King appoints (a) a Coronation Committee of theCouncil to deal with the general arrangements, and (b) a Courtof Claims.  Although the two bodies are distinct, their membership is the same.  The Coronation Committee in its turn appoints an executive Committee, which undertakes the main burden of the detailed preparation.     On the present occasion there is a strong case for somedeparture from precedent.  Since the last Coronation therehave been far-reaching changes in the constitutional positionof the Empire, and we consider that all the Dominions, v/ith the                          -4-
possible exception of the Irish Free State, would be gratifiedby an invitation to co-operate in those aspects of the arrange-ments which are of common interest and not purely the domestic concern of the United Kingdom.11,  For these reasons the Coronation Council, v/hich took placeon Hay 28th last, fixed the date of the Coronation and appointed the Court of Claims, but did not appoint the usual coronation committee.12.  The way is thus open for proposals to enlist the co-operation of the Dominion Governments.   Our proposal is asfollows:   The Dominions Secretary might suggest to the variousDominion Governments that the arrangements for  the Coronationmight on this occasion be undertaken by a Coronation Commissionrepresentative of the United Kingdom and Dominion governments and that they should advise His Majesty in this sense.   Theword &quot;Commission&apos;1 is chosen in order to differentiate this body from the traditional Committee of the Privy Council.  Itwould not be proper that the Commission should be appointed bythe Home Government.  The appointment ought  to be made by HisMajesty&apos; preferably under the Sign Manual, on  the advice ofhis different Governments, constitutionally  tendered.  after this His Majesty might make a formal announcement that inaccordance with the advice thus given a Coronation commission had been constituted of such and such persons.13.  It would still be necessary to appoint a  Committee ofthe Privy Council to conduct such business relating to the coronation as is solely the concern of the United Kingdom.The United Kingdom members of the Commission should be thesame as the members of the Privy Council Committee.14.  A little time will no doubt be necessary if our recommendations are accepted for the tenderingof advice from the various Dominions.     In themeantime a large number of purely domestic questions                       -5-
have arisen regarding, e.g. the arrangements for WestminsterAbbeys the route of the procession,  and official hospitality,on which an urgent decision is required.   These matters makeit necessary that the privy Council  Committee referred to inthe last paragraph should be set up  forthwith,  and we recommendthat the necessary steps should be taken without delay.     It would be necessary for the Dominions Secretary,  whenmaking the suggestion to the Dominion Governments that adviceshould be tendered, regarding a Coronation Commission, toexplain that the purely domestic work that is required to bedone by the Coronation Committee cannot be held up pending theappointment of the Commission,15.  The Dominion Governments might  also he informed that theCommission referred to in paragraph  12 would he presided, overby a Chairman cnosen by His Majesty, who might  think fit to nominate the Duke of York.   It would be for the Chairman toappoint a Secretary, through whom meetings would he called..Subject to the King&apos;s consent, the actual place of meeting might be St. James&apos;s Palace.   It might also be suggested thatfor practical reasons it would be desirable for the quorum ofthe Commission to be a small one, on the understanding thatany meeting should, if possible, be  attended by at least one representative of each Dominion which had nominated members.SUMMARY.16.  Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarised asfollows%-     (a) The Coronation Oath.          (i) The revision of  the Oath now contemplated              should be limited to what is necessary to              give effect to the alteration in  the              constitutional position effected  by the              Statute of Westminster.
  (ii) The Cabinet Committee see considerable      objection to the provisions of the suggested.      South African lav/ and to the terras of the      collective Oath suggested by South Africa,,      If there is delay in. approving a more      appropriate form, there is a clanger that      some of the other Dominions may propose to      take action in accordance with the South      African draft.  (iii) The Committee itself would have preferred      a form of Oath mentioning by name no part      of the Empire, except the United Kingdom.      Having regard, however, to the views of the      Secretary of State for India, the following      draft is submitted for the consideration of      the Cabinet:         &quot;Will you solemnly promise and swear to          govern the people of this United Kingdom          of G-reat Britain and northern Ireland,          of your Dominions, of India,  and of your          Territories and Possessions beyond the          Seas,.according to tie respective laws          and customs of the same?&quot;      If this form of words is adopted by the Cabinet      and proves generally acceptable,  no legislation      will be necessary to effect the change,  and the      Dominions should be so informed.      Whilst tie Cabinet may consider that the final      recommendations might appropriately be made      by the Coronation Commission (see Conclusion      (b)(ii:))  it is desirable that the proposals      of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United      Kingdom should be communicated forthwith      to the Dominion  Governments.      It will of course be necessary at a later      stage to ascertain the King&apos;s Pleasure in      regard to the actual change of wording.Association of the Dominions in the Coronation, ^ceremonj^.  (i) Having regard to the far-reaching constitutional      changes which have taken place since the last      Coronation,  the Dominions should now be  invited      to co-operate in the Coronation arrangements *  (ii) The most suitable procedure would be that &quot;die      Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs  should      convey a suggestion to the various Dominion      Governments  that they should tender advice to      His Majesty to the effect that a Coronation      Commission be set up,  representative of the      United Kingdom and Dominion Governments,  to      consider those aspects of the arrangements      which are of common interest,  and not purely      the domestic concern of the United Kingdom.(iii) A large number&apos;of domestic questions require      early decision,  and we recommend that,      for this reason the appointment of the      Coronation Committee of the Privy Council      should be made at an earl:/ date.               -7-
(iv)  The United Kingdom membership of the     Coronation Commission (see ii) should     be identical with that of the&apos;Coronation     Committee  (see iii).Signed on &quot;behalf of the Coiam.ittee     J.  R IJ/I say MACDONALD.                 Chairman,2,  Whit ehall Gardens ,  S.W.1.    June 16th, 19360
