Copy  No.CP. 141 (36).TO BE  KEPT  UNDER LOCK  AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to     ensure the secrecy of this document.                CABINET.THE DRAFT  REGENCY BILL.                    Memorandum by the Home Secretary.    I HAVE  been asked by the Prime Minister to bring before  the  Cabinet,with a view to its introduction at an early  date, the attached draft of a Billto make permanent provision for a Regency  in the event (a) of the Heir to the throne being under the age of eighteen years on his accession, and (b) of thetotal incapacity of the Sovereign by reason of illness.   The  Bill also enablesall or any of the royal  functions to be delegated by the Sovereign to Counsellorsof State in the  event of the absence or impending absence of the Sovereign fromthe  United  Kingdom,  or of an illness of  the  Sovereign not involving totalincapacity.  There are less important  provisions dealing  with the  possibilityof the absence from the United Kingdom of  the Heir to the Throne at the timeof  his accession,  or of the absence  of  the  Regent  at the  commencement of aRegency.    2.  The Bill  originated in  the strong desire expressed  by  His late Majestythat a recurrence of the sudden emergency of  December  1928 might not,  ashappened on that occasion, find  both Executive and Legislature  unprepared; andit is a matter of  profound regret that the provision which He desired had notin fact been made before His final illness.  It  has been for some time realised thatthe  appointment of Counsellors of State was not a satisfactory solution of thedifficulty.  The King might be  too ill to hold a Council  for the purpose, and itis also open to grave doubt whether the delegation to  Counsellors of  State ofcertain functions (as where a statute requires the Royal Sign Manual for theexecution of some instrument) could be effected without  legislation.    3.  The Bill accordingly provides that where the Royal  Consort,  the Heirto the Throne  (if  of full age),  and  certain high officers of State,  or any three off them,  certify in writing  that the Sovereign has become incapable for the timebeing by reason of infirmity of mind  or body  of performing His Royal functions,those functions shall be  performed in the name and on behalf of His Majestyby a Regent, so long as the incapacity continues.     4.  The  Sovereign is to  be empowered  to nominate in advance  by Letters.Patent the person who will act as Regent,  and that person may be either theRoyal Consort, or the  mother of the Heir to the Throne, or any person in theline of succession to the  Throne. If no such nomination is in  force at the timewhen the contingency occurs, then the person  who is next in the line of succession to the Throne is to become Regent.  A person will be disqualified from becomingor being Regent, if he is not a British  subject of full age and resident in theUnited Kingdom, or if he professes the Roman Catholic faith.

    5.  The case of the possible accession of a Sovereign while still under theage of eighteen years has hitherto been dealt with ad hoc on each occasion  as itarose.  Thus in  1910, when the  then Heir to the Throne was only sixteen yearsof age, provision was made by  the Regency Act of that year for Queen Maryto become Regent, in the event  of the  demise of the Crown while  the Heir tothe Throne was still under eighteen.  The present Bill makes permanent provision in such circumstances for a Regent, who will be appointed in the same way andfrom  among the same  persons  as the  Regent appointed in the  case  of the sovereign&apos;s incapacity by reason of illness.    6.  If it be said that  in the past Parliament has always reserved to itself the right to say, as and when the occasion arose, who the Regent was to be, andthat the present Bill takes the appointment  out of the  hands of parliament and puts it into the hands of the  Crown, the answer is (though the Bill is of coursesilent on the subject) that  the nomination by Letters Patent of  a Regent couldnot be made at the present day  save on the advice of Ministers,  who could also,if necessary, advise that a particular  appointment should be withdrawn andanother substituted, a power to do this being reserved to the Sovereign by theBill.   It is also clear that the  persons from  among whom under the Bill theRegent may be appointed do not exclude any person whose claim to be appointedwould be insisted upon,  or at least admitted, by Parliament.    7.  When the Bill  was brought before the Cabinet last year, it was left tothe Secretary  of State  for Dominion  Affairs to consult  the Dominion repre-sentatives who were then in London on  the occasion of His late Majesty&apos;s silver jubilee (Cabinet 19 (35), Conclusion 6).  It was accordingly explained to  themthat His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the  United Kingdom  hoped that they (theDominions) would feel able to recognise the acts of a Regent appointed under a united Kingdom statute as equivalent in all respects to the acts of the Sovereign,so far as each Dominion was concerned; but that it was,  of course,  for  each dominion to determine  for itself whether any local legislation was also requiredin order to validate in  the Dominion  the acts of a Regent so appointed.  Therepresentatives of Canada,  the  Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealandstated that they were content to recognise a Regent appointed under a  UnitedKingdom statute without further legislation  of their own,  and they  expressedindeed some doubt (which I venture to share) whether in law the matter was one on  which  any but  the Parliament  at  Westminster had  power to legislate.General Hertzog was at first also willing to treat the matter as one of machineryonly and  as involving  no  question  of  constitutional principle,  but desired toconsider on his  return  to South Africa the effect of the South African RoyalFunctions and Seals Act, 1934, which confers  power on the  Governor-General incertain events to sign  Instruments which would  otherwise require the  King&apos;ssignature.  The most recent information is, however, now to the effect that in theopinion of the Union Government special local legislation would be necessary inSouth  Africa to meet the case of the appointment of a Regent for a protractedperiod; but that they  do  not  contemplate taking legislative action  until theemergency actually arises.    8.  Mr. de Valera,  on hearing of the proposed legislation, protested against it,  being apparently under the  impression that  it was intended that the Billshould extend to the Irish Free State.   He was assured by  the Prime minister that it would be entirely a matter  for the Irish Free State to decide whether any legislation was  necessary  to enable a  Regent or Counsellors of State,  in thecircumstances  set out in the Bill, to  perform any of  the royal functions  inrelation to the Irish Free State,  and that this would be made clear in Parliament,if and when the Bill was introduced.  It is thought that any misapprehension ofthe position by  Mr.  de Valera  must have now been removed : at any  rate  nofurther communication has been  received from the Irish Free State on the subject.It would  no doubt create  a difficulty  if, after the Bill had  become law in theUnited Kingdom,  the  Irish Free State  passed legislation  providing  for theappointment of  a different Regent to perform the royal functions in.relation tothe Irish Free State, or,  by passing no legislation, left (as it were) a vacant  Thronefor the time being; and the views  held by the two countries on matters affectingthe Crown might in that  case  unhappily become still  more divergent than atpresent.  But to accept the position that no legislation is possible without the fullconcurrence of the Irish Free State would be in effect to admit a right of the Irish
Free State  to veto legislation extending only to the United Kingdom, and the dilemma must, therefore, be faced.  It can only be hoped that Mr. de Valera willeither not think it necessary to legislate at all, or, if he is advised that legislation is necessary, will legislate on lines similar to those in the present Bill. .    9.   I annex (A), the memorandum which accompanied the draft Bill when itwas before  the Cabinet last year, and (B)  an  Opinion of the Law Officers, datedthe 28th November, 1934, in answer to certain questions submitted to them.   Itwill be seen that this Opinion emphasises the great advantage there will be  inmaking  statutory provision for the contingencies with which the present Bill  isintended to deal.

REGENCY QUESTIONS.                           Note by the Secretary.    THE Prime  Minister has instructed me  to circulate to the Cabinet theattached memorandum prepared by Sir Claud Schuster as the result of inter-departmental discussions on the general question  of the procedure to be adoptedin the various contingencies which might arise, necessitating emergency action for the performance of the duties  of the Sovereign.    2.   Attached to  the memorandum is  a draft Regency Bill prepared after taking the opinion of the Law Officers of the  Crown.    3.   Attention is  called to the  secrecy  of  these papers.                              (Signed)      M. P. A. HANKEY,                                                  Secretary to the Cabinet.    2 Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1,          March 28, 1935.    1.   It  will be  remembered  that, before the last Imperial Conference, an interdepartmental Committee examined the general  question  of  the  procedure to be adopted  in the various  contingencies which  might  arise  necessitatingemergency action for  the performance of the duties of the Sovereign.    2.   The contingencies discussed were :.&apos;           (1) Minority of the heir to the throne on the demise of the Crown.          (2) Absence of the heir to the throne on  the demise of the Crown.          (3) Total incapacity  of the Sovereign.          (4) Partial incapacity of the Sovereign.          (5) Absence of the Sovereign.    3.   The Report of the Interdepartmental  Committee will be found amongthe Imperial  Conference  Papers marked E  (B) (30) 7.    4.   This  Report  was circulated to the  Cabinet,  but was  not furnished toany but the United Kingdom representatives, though some of the matters towhich it relates were mentioned  at a meeting of the Prime Ministers and Headsof Delegations held on the 10th November,  1930 (PM. (30) 21).    5.   It was not  at that time deemed  expedient to  followr up the matter.    6.   Since then the passage of the Statute of Westminster  and recent legis-lation in the Union of South Africa have increased the difficulties which would arise upon the happening of any of the contingencies  described above.   Further-more, it is understood that the King has expressed a wish that these  problemsshould be  considered  afresh so  that, while  he is in  his  present  good state ofhealth,  such  action-whether  legislative  or  otherwise as  may be  thought desirable, may be taken to provide  against  the  happening of any such event.

    7.  Accordingly,  an  Interdepartmental   Committee,   presided   over   bySir Maurice Hankey,  has again considered the matter.  In  the course of theirdeliberations it became apparent that certain legal and constitutional questionsarose upon which it was desirable to take the Opinion of the Law Officers.  A case was accordingly submitted to the Law Officers, who, so far as is material to thepresent question, advised as follows :          &quot; The general conclusion we have formed as to the proper treatment of    the issues  raised in these questions is that there is  a very great advantage in    deciding to make the necessary arrangements by  Statute.   If  our view    expressed  above is correct,* the provisions of such a Statute  would only be    valid quoad a Dominion which has adopted the Statute if the assent of that    Dominion  had been obtained and was declared in  accordance  with section 4    of the Statute of Westminster.  On the other hand, any legislation ought, in    our opinion, carefully to guard the Prerogative, and it would not, we think,    be difficult to do this by a Preamble suitably framed.   It is much easier to    undertake this task when there is time and opportunity, as there happily is    at the present time, than to await the arrival of an eznergency, when it may    be impossible to avoid resort to the  Royal Prerogative, and even to some of    the fictions which have been necessary in the past.&quot;    8.  In accordance with this advice, the draft of a  Bill has been prepared bythe Parliamentary Counsel, a copy of which is attached.    9.  The proposals of the Bill are as  follows :      (a) The Sovereign is  authorised  by Letters Patent to nominate a  Regent to           act either in the case of the minority of his successor  (up to the age           of 18), or in the event of he himself becoming incapable through illness.    (b) The person  to be so nominated may, at  the will of the Sovereign, be the           Royal Consort, the Mother of  the heir to the throne, or any person in           the line of succession to the Crown, being in any case a British subject           of full age, resident in the United Kingdom and capable  under the           Act of Settlement of succeeding.    (c) The Sovereign is also authorised, if he desires to do  so, by reason  of his           absence or impending absence  from the United Kingdom or by reason           of  any illness  or  other like cause, by Letters Patent  to delegate to           Counsellors of State any such  functions as he may choose.  The persons           so chosen must be persons capable of holding the  Regency.    (d) Provision is also made for the case of a Sovereign who succeeds when of           full age but is at his accession absent from  the United  Kingdom.   In           that case, four persons  of full age and present in the United Kingdom           who are next in the line of succession or any two of them shall exercise           the Royal functions until the  Sovereign is able to do so.  This replaces           the Lords  Justices  Act,  1837, which  both  by reason  of effluxion of           time and by reason of some  of its provisions both in  spirit and in           letter having  become  hopelessly obsolete.   The  Law  Officers  have           advised that this Act ought to be repealed.     10.   It  may be thought  desirable to discuss with  such of  the Dominionsrepresentatives who are in this country on the occasion of His Majesty&apos;s Jubileethe questions which arise in this  matter. It is therefore  desirable, in the firstplace, that the Bill  in its broad outlines  should be placed before the Cabinet andfurther provision made in the matter.     House of  Lords, March 7, 1935.   * We ourselves take the view that, in so far as the functions of the Crown  are exercisedquoad a  Dominion,  any legislation by the  Imperial Parliament as to the way in which thosefunctions should be  exercised in certain events would come within the reach of section 4 of theStatute  of Westminster,  and, even apart  from section 4, we  are of opinion that it. would nolonger be constitutionally proper to pass such legislation in the Imperial Parliament without the assent of the Dominions.  It need hardly be  said that, so far as any functions are concerned whichin no way concern the Dominions, the Imperial Parliament is quite unfettered. &apos;-&apos;

ANNEX&apos; B.         (i) Questions rput to the Law Officers of the Crown in 1934.     (1) Is it  legally and constitutionally proper, by adopting the procedure of a dormant commission, to provide for the delegation of the  Royal functions to the persons designated in the commission?     (2) If so, can the functions delegated include the affixing of the Royal Sign Manual  to  those instruments to which the Royal Sign  Manual is rendered necessary by Act of Parliament&apos;?     (3) Is it possible to include in  such a commission the delegation of the exercise of those functions, such as the receipt of homage, which appear to involve the special personal intervention of the Monarch ?     (4) Would it be constitutionally proper, since the passage of the  Statute of Westminster,  for legislation by the Imperial Parliament  to provide  for the manner in which the executive functions of the Crown should be exercised in the event of the illness or incapacity of the Sovereign ?     (5) If the answer to Question 4 is in the affirmative, do the provisions of the Statute of Westminster impose any limit upon the scope of such legislation ?     (6) Are the provisions of the Lords Justices Act, 1837, in  force so as to provide machinery  for the contingency of the absence of the heir  to  the throne upon the demise of  the Crown 1                      (ii) Opinion of the Law  Officers.     The questions upon which we are asked to  express our opinion are in form legal questions, but they can hardly be answered without due wTeight being given to political as well as legal considerations.   The constitutional position is to be deduced  in  part from precedents,  but the  value of the precedents naturally depends  upon the  extent to  which the circumstances in which  they occurred resemble the circumstances of to-day.  To take an  extreme case, the ordinance of Henry IV  in 1406  delegating some of the work  of government could hardly be taken as a precedent for these very different times.  The fact is the  precedents do no more than illustrate the principles to be borne in mind; they do not make a  kind  of  case-law  on the  matters under consideration.  The  growth  of parliamentary institutions has made one great difference between those times and these.  Another  difference is due to  the changes in the status of  the Dominions. The  relations  of  the Crown and the  Dominions notwithstanding the work done at the  last two Imperial Conferences, and by the Conference on  the  Operation of Dominion Legislation and the effect of the Statute of Westminster in the case of those Dominions which have adopted it, are still imperfectly crystallised. For these reasons,  analogies based on the  incidents to which  our  attention is called in the most instructive memoranda  E (B)  (30) 7  and R  (34) 1 break down, if pressed too far.  Letters Patent and Orders in Council were in those times natural and  proper  instruments for effecting  the Royal  purpose of making convenient provision for the discharge of  the functions of the Sovereign.  In these days they may  prove quite unsuitable.  The  right approach to the questions  we are asked to answer is more likely  to be made  if we try to achieve the greatest balance of convenience  rather  than  if we consider them from a strictly  juridical point  of view.  If we keep that guiding star  steadily  in view the precedents will be most valuable  in marking out the broad  road to  be followed  and the  pitfalls to  be avoided.  We shall, moreover, be less likely to give any occasion to certain of the Dominions to raise  unseemly wrangles over fine  points of constitutional law.    With these considerations before us we answer the questions as follows :      1.   There is, in our view,  clearly no objection to the use of the machinery of a dormant Commission if it is  done under Parliamentary sanction.   Action taken under its authority could not then be successfully challenged in any court of law. Considered apart from Parliamentary sanction, we  do not think that the form of a dormant Commission would in itself in any way invalidate a delegation made by the  issue of Letters Patent  under the authority of an Order in Council.  The persons on whom the King&apos;s powers were conferred would  not, in our opinion,
 stand in relation to the King  as  agents to a principal,  and we  doubt if any argument  based on  the  general  law of  agency such  as those mentioned  in paragraph 33  of  the Memorandum R (34)  1  would  be held applicable.   The problems suggested by the demise  of the Crown, which has been the  subject of legislation from time to  time, show  that the characteristics of the Crown are unique in our legal system.  A  distinction has often been  drawn by Parliament between the King as  a private person and the King  in His &quot; politick capacity &quot; (Maitland &quot;Crown  as  Corporation&quot;).  If the delegation (if that is the right word) by a dormant  Commission purported to cover, or was used to cover, a case where the King had become totally incapable by reason of mental or  physical infirmity, objections could not in  our  opinion be raised on the ground  that the form of a dormant Commission  had been used.   In such a  case objections might, however, be raised, based on the position taken up in George the Third&apos;s reign, that in the event of  a total incapacity which might  last for a considerable  time Parliamentary authority was necessary in order to give the Regent the necessary powers (see E (B)  30, 7, paragraph 17).     We consider  below  the  effect  of  the precedents  on the  power to  delegate without statutory  authority.   We  do  not think any  objection could or would be taken to the issue of Letters Patent without Parliamentary sanction in a mere case of a short absence of  the Sovereign from the  Realm.   Apart from this, we think that delegation  without statutory  authority,  whether by a dormant Commission or otherwise, might give rise not  only to constitutional questions, but also to questions of great difficulty as between the United Kingdom and the Dominions.     2.   It is obvious, in view of the opinion expressed by the  Lord. Chancellor and  the Attorney-General in 1925 to  the effect that the function  of  fixing the Royal Sign Manual to instruments to which it is required  by Act of Parliament to be  applied could  not  be  delegated, that  a contrary opinion could  only  be expressed with  great hesitation.   For ourselves we should have thought that, assuming the existence of the power to delegate any of the Royal functions, the direction contained  in  the Statutes  does  not  in any way affect  or  limit  the prerogative right which would exist apart from the Statutes.  It would, however, be unwise to proceed on the assumption that this  function could be properly included.     3.   We are not clear as to the nature of the functions other than the receipt of homage which involve the special personal intervention of the Monarch.   So far as homage is  concerned,  there  appears to be some precedent for  regarding this  as a matter which might be delegated.  Henry V in  1415 appears  to have withheld this right from exercise  by  any other  person than himself.  The fact that it was expressly excepted may be some  reason  for thinking he might have included it if he had wished.   Edward III certainly in 1340 nominated his son to receive  the  homage  and fealty of his  tenants-in-chief  (The  Great Seal, pp. 173-175, Maxwell-Lyte).   If a situation similar  to that which arose  in 1928 should  arise before any  statutory  provision  could be made, we think that  the above-mentioned precedents rather than the  view taken in 1928 might  well be followed.     4.  If this  question was to be answered as  a matter of strictly legal inter-pretation of the provisions of the  Statute of Westminster, we should regard it as a very doubtful matter.  There  is a good deal to be said for the view that the United Kingdom  Parliament  has power to arrange the  machinery  for  the incapacity of the Crown, and perhaps an argument for this view may be drawn from the manner in which the Act of Settlement and the Succession to the Throne. are treated.   The Preamble to the Statute of  Westminster contains a recital that any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and  Titles shall  hereafter require the assent of the Parliaments of the Dominions as well as that  of  the United Kingdom.  It might be suggested with some forcethat this defines the limits of the legal rights of the Dominions quoad the Crown,and  that as  the  matters under   consideration  deal  merely  with temporarymachinery, the Parliament of the  United Kingdom,  in which the King  resides,is the  authority within  the Empire for dealing with  the matter.  As a matterof pure legal  construction, however,  this  could  not affect the construction  ofsection 4, and it is by no means unlikely that a Court would construe that sectionas applicable to the present subject-matter.   Indeed, we ourselves take the view
Law Officers&apos; Department,            November 28, 1934. that, in so far as  the functions of the Crown are exercised quoad a Dominion, any legislation by the Imperial Parliament as to the way in which those functions should be exercised in certain events would come within the reach of section 4 of the Statute of Westminster, and, even apart from section 4, we are of opinion that it would no longer be constitutionally proper to pass such legislation in the Imperial Parliament without the assent  of the Dominions.  It  need hardly be said that so far as  any functions  are concerned which in no way concern the Dominions the Imperial Parliament is quite unfettered.    5.   In so far as this question arises, we have already answered it.    6.   There is no expression of an intention in the Lords Justices Act contrary to the presumption that it- refers to the Sovereign  for the time being.   We are therefore of opinion  that the Act might well be held to be still in force by virtue of section 30 of the  Interpretation Act, but, whether this is so or not, we  have no hesitation in saying  that, in our opinion, this Act ought to be repealed.   Its provisions, both in  spirit and in the letter, are hopelessly obsolete.    The  general conclusion  we have formed as to  the proper treatment of the issues raised in these questions is that there is a very great advantage in deciding to make the necessary arrangements by Statute.  If our  view as expressed in4 above is correct,  the provisions  of such a Statute  would only be valid quoad a dominion which had adopted the Statute if the assent of that Dominion hadbeen obtained  and  was  declared in accordance with section 4 of the Statute of westminster.  On  the other  hand, any legislation ought, in our opinion, carefullyto guard the Prerogative, and it would not, we think, be difficult to do this  by aPreamble suitably  framed.  It is much easier to undertake this task when thereis time and opportunity, as there happily is at the present time, than to await the arrival of an emergency, when it  may be impossible to avoid resort to the royal prerogative and even to some of the fictions which have been necessary in the past.                                                              T. W.  H.  I.                                                              D. B.  S.
