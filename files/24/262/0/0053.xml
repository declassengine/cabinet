                  0 A B I I? E T.        BRITISH SHIPPING IIT THE PACIFIC...    Note by the President of the Board of Trade.    With reference to the discussion at the last meetingof the Cabinet (Cabinet 41 (36), Conclusion 9), I thinkmy colleagues will be interested to read the attachedprogress report by the Board of Trade on the examination ofthe shipping position in the Pacific.Board of Trade,   13th June, 1936.W.R.
                                                         *f P \s              BRITISH  SHIPPING   IN   THE  PACIFIC.        &amp; *f O                  MATSON LINE   COMPETITION.        Note on progress made  in examining  the  problem.     (1) The problem under consideration  is the position of  theBritish Shipping Lines  engaged in regular passenger  and  cargoservices between the West Coast  of North  America and Australiaand New Zealand.   These lines are subject  to  intensecompetition from the United States &quot;Matson  Line&quot; which has  usedheavy subsidies from the United States Government to build  fastand luxurious vessels for this trade.     (2) The present situation originated in 1931 and 1932when the service of the Matson Line  between the United Statesand Australia was extended to  New Zealand and the Company puton the service two new vessels much  superior to any  of the competing British vessels.   The aspect which first  engagedattention was the encroachment of the Matson Line on the passenger trade between Australia and New Zealand;  and  theGovernments of those countries at different times between 1931and 1934 raised the question of action for the protection ofthe British vessels which belonged for the  most part to companies registered in Australia, New Zealand or Canada.     (3) The nature of the proposed action was never clearly defined, but the possibility of excluding the Matson vesselsfrom trade between Australia and New Zealand (on the analogyox the American exclusion of British vessels from the trade between the United States and Honolulu) was suggested.   TheUnited Kingdom Government pointed out that  Governmental  action for this purpose might  provoke retaliation by the United Statesagainst British shipping generally and the  losses resultingfrom this retaliation might far outweigh the gains secured  inthe local Australian New Zealand trade.     (4) The presence of Ministers from the  Dominions in  thiscountry during the early summer of 1935 gave an opportunityof discussing the subject further.   At a meeting on the                           -1-
31st May, 1935, when the United Kingdom, Australian andNew Zealand Ministers were present (the meeting was open to representatives of other Dominions hut none attended), theUnited Kingdom Government caveat against measures such asreservation which might provoke the United States toretaliatory action, was withdrawn.   It was agreed that australia and New Zealand should discuss and decide on theaction they wished to take, but nothing definite resulted.Australia and New Zealand apparently were unable or unwilling to come to a decision.     (5) Since then the problem has assumed a wider aspect.The Union Steamship Company of New Zealand which has hithertorun a service between San Francisco and Australia-New Zealandhas announced the discontinuance of this service as fromnext November;  and the Canadian Australasian Line (a canadian Company) which has run a service between BritishColumbia and Australia-New Zealand has indicated that it may also be forced to discontinue its service.      (6) The matter was again discussed between ministers on the 7th April last when Dr. Page,  Mr. Menzies andMr. Bruce, representing Australia, Sir James parr,representing New Zealand, and Mr. Massey, representingCanada, met the President of the Board of Trade and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.   It was thenarranged that a Sub-Committee of officials of the three british Dominions with representatives of the Board of Tradeand the Dominions Office should go into the question in suchdetail as the discussions had indicated and as might befound necessary &quot;and desirable.     (7) The Sub-Committee met on the 27th April.   Themeeting would have been held earlier  but Mr.  Alexander Shawhad promised a definite Memorandum containing proposals.This Memorandum was not received until the 23rd April and was                      -2-
immediately examined.    The Sub-Committee which had before itMr. Shaw&apos;s Memorandum  and the available information and a listof points drawn up by  the Board of Trade on which furtherinformation was required, recommended that the Imperial shipping committee should be asked to investigate such questions of factas traffic possibilities, the past and probable future financial results, and the kind  of shipping service appropriate.     (8) The New Zealand Government and the United KingdomGovernment agreed to this proposal and Dr. Page on behalf ofthe Australian Government expressed willingness to agree if theother Governments were willing.   Canada&apos;s reply, disagreeingwith the proposal, was received through the. High Commissioneron the 14th May.   After discussion with the High Commissionersrepresentative, a letter was sent by the Board of Trade to himon loth May suggesting that the Canadian Government had notappreciated the limited character of the reference and asking that the proposal should be explained to the Canadian Government.This was done.     (9) It was clearly impossible to proceed without Canada&apos;assent, and the necessity for awaiting this has caused delay.The High Commissioner, after sending reminders at our request,informed us on 11th June that the Canadian Government agree toan investigation by the Imperial Shipping Committee on theunderstanding that the Committee will confine itself tofindings of fact.     (10)in the meantime a revised memorandum was received onthe 13th May from Mr.  Shaw in substitution for the earlier memorandum referred to in paragraph (7) above.   The mainproposal in this Memorandum is that the Canadian-AustralasianLine should build in United Kingdom yards two new shipscomparable with the existing Matson Line vessels, at a cost ofabout  2,500,000, and route these vessels via San Francisco inthe southbound, but not in the northbound, direction.   No
definite proposal for a subsidy is put forward, but theMemorandum states that the Line &quot;would not be justified in building such ships unless sufficient financial assistance wasgiven by the Governments concerned&quot;.   It also invites the&quot;serious consideration of the Governments&quot; to the need for anincreased subsidy for the existing ships so as to keep them inoperation&quot; until the proposed new ships are brought intooperation i- a period of about two years.     (11) Now that the assent of all the Governments concernedhas been given, the examination of the problem from the pointof view indicated in paragraph (7) will be placed in the handsof the Imperial Shipping Committee,  whose Chairman is aware ofwhat is proposed and who will be prepared to complete the inquiries as soon as possible.   The announcement of theactual terms of reference will however, have to await theagreement of the Canadian Government to whom the draft (whichhas been accepted by Australia and New Zealand)  has beentelegraphed by the High Commissioner.Board of Trade,  13th June, 1.936*
