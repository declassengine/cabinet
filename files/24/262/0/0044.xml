THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTv1-Printed for the Cabinet.  June  1936.SECRET.                                                           Copy  No.CP. 154 (36).CABINET.DISPUTE  BETWEEN ITALY  AND  ABYSSINIA.    IN accordance with the Conclusions of the Cabinet meeting of the 29th may i circulate to my colleagues herewith a memorandum, prepared in  the ForeignOffice,  oh the  probable effect of maintaining sanctions.                                                                     A.  E.    Foreign Office, June 3, 1936.   PROBABLE  EFFECT OF  EXISTING  SANCTIONS ON  ITALY  IF                 MAINTAINED AFTER JUNE  15 NEXT.            [NOTE.  1 sterling is equivalent to about 55 gold lire.]                                      I.     IT is clear that any opinion on this  subject must be speculative.  There is both a lack of sufficient direct evidence, owing to the suppression of all publicstatistics in Italy,  and a number of indeterminate factors, such as the extent towhich the Italian people will endure  privations,  the number of soldiers  andlabourers which  will sooner or later have to be withdrawn from Ethiopia,  theamount to be  expended on materiel, &amp;c, in connexion with the pacification anddevelopment of that country, and, above  all, the scrupulousness, or the reverse,observed  by &quot; sanctionist &quot; countries  in  administering the present  sanctionsregime.   Assuming, however,   that  there  will, apart perhaps  from SouthAmerica^1) be no appreciable defections from the &quot;sanctions  front&quot;  for threemonths after the  15th June, it is possible to arrive at certain estimates regardingthe  internal economic situation in Italy  on  the 15th September  next.  these estimates will primarily be based on the situation, so far as we know it, in italy to-day.                    II.-THE   ECONOMIC  SITUATION.                      (a)  Evidence of League  Statistics.     Certain important facts stand out from an examination of the League figures,which, however, only appear in full  after considerable delay :       1.  During the first two months  of  1936 (i.e., when sanctions began to comeinto effective operation) the value of Italian trade with the world as a whole was approximately halved, both imports and exports falling  in much the same ratio    (*) The published statistics relating to South and Central America, though very incomplete,suggest  that Italy&apos;s  exports  to those areas have  not greatly declined during the &quot; sanctions&apos;period.&quot;  Some of the more important South American countries have either not yet applied theimport embargo or are applying it only with important reservations.      8628  [13296]                                                 B
 as compared with the corresponding period of 1935.  In the case of the: sanction- applying countries, their  imports from Italy during  this  period  fell to about one-fifth of  what they had been in the first two months of 1935, while their exports to Italy fell to about one-third.   If the  preliminary figures  (nineteen countries only)  for March last are  a reliable guide, total Italian  trade during that month was only about 44 per cent, of total trade during March 1935, Italian exports in that month falling to a much greater extent, proportionately,  than imports.     2.  An examination of the figures regarding Italian trade with the principal non-sanctionist countries, i.e., Germany, the United States, Hungary and Austria, show that, on balance, their imports from Italy during  the  period  November- February inclusive increased by about  19 million lire, and their exports to Italy by about 170,600,000  lire,  as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year.   Nevertheless, during the latter part of the period  both imports from and exports to these countries showed a marked  tendency to  decline.   For instance,  in the  case  of  Germany,  imports  from  Italy,  which  were up  by 9,500,000 lire in December, were down by 13,300,000 in January and  by 11,400,000 in February; while exports to Italy, which were up  by 28,500,000  in November, and  38,000,000  in December,  were only up  by 7,600,000 in January, and in February were 3,800,000 less than in February 1935.  The same tendency (thoughto a modified degree)  is observable in Hungary  and  Austria.  United States imports  from Italy showed a marked increase in  November of  no less  than 21,850,000 lire over November 1934.  In December the increase was 17,100,000 lire,  in January 3,800,000,  and in February 228,000.  So far as the United States exports to Italy  were concerned, there was an increase of 7,600,000  lire in November, 34,150,000  in December,  a decrease of  8,930,000 in January and an increase  of  6,080,000 in  February.   Switzerland  (which  is  only  applying sanctions to  a limited extent) has during the period November-February taken about 38 million lire worth less of Italian goods  and  exported almost  exactly the same amount less  to Italy.     3.  Imports from Italy of  &quot; sanctionist &quot;  countries (i:e., those  countrieswhich have refused to accept Italian goods) accounted  for about 19 per cent, of the total of the  world&apos;s imports from Italy in January and about 9 per cent, in February (as against 50 per cent, in each case in  January and February 1935). This seems to point to the fact that &quot;  sanctionist &quot; countries  have  on the whole been loyally  applying  Proposal III.  This conclusion  is in the main borne out by an  examination of  the figures regarding individual countries  (and also by reports from Rome).    4.  Italy&apos;s  absolute unfavourable balance  of visible trade  seems  to have decreased appreciably  during the &quot; sanctions period &quot;  as compared with  thecorresponding period  a year before. (2)  Thus  sanctions may  not in  themselves have directly brought about a positive increase in the rate of  outflow of  gold from Italy.  This is not to say, however, that they have been ineffective in this respect.  The decrease in the unfavourable balance  is due to the fact that Italy&apos;s imports have been cut down to an even greater extent than her exports, and the embargo on  her  products  will,  on the one hand,  have prevented  her from economising  gold by the use of foreign exchange derived  from her  exports, and on the other hand will have compelled her to reduce her  imports to an extent even greater  than circumstances would  otherwise  have  required, thus  further worsening  her general economic  situation.   Moreover, it is practically certain that  Italy&apos;s invisible  exports  (tourist  expenditure,  freights,   emigrants&apos; remittances,  &amp;c.)&apos; have declined  heavily of late, so that the real deficit on  her balance of payments will have deteriorated in comparison with normal times to a greater extent than the visible trade figures would suggest.     In any case the figures of visible trade fail fully to disclose the position.  A number of additions to them fall to be made which go to swell Italy&apos;s unfavourable balance of payments.   A large item among these  is the expenditure of Italy&apos;s ships in ports outside Italy, especially on bunkers.  Suez Canal dues on the basis   (2) So the  League figures would suggest.  But figures  quoted by the Italian Minister of Finance on May 19 last  suggest  that in the  period December 1935 to February  .1936 Italy&apos;s unfavourable trade  balance was practically the same as a year previously.
                           (b)  Evidence from  Italy.                     (1) Effect on Italian Foreign Trade.    In January  Signor Piero  Pirelli, one  of the  best known  of  Italianindustrialists, and who is said to.enjoy the confidence of Signor Mussolini, madea speech to the Fascist Confederation of Industrialists,  the text of which  wasgiven in an Italian periodical on the 23rd January.    &quot;The question of defence against sanctions,&quot; he observed, &quot;is in the  lastanalysis no more than a corollary, or in our case an acute extension of the exchangeproblem &quot; ; and he went on to estimate, with remarkable accuracy, that the closing of &apos;&apos; sanctionist&apos;&apos; markets would reduce Italian exports by about one-half. &apos;&apos; evenon the very optimistic assumption that the  non-sanctionist&apos;  markets continueto yield as much as they used to do.&quot;   He stated quite plainly that, apart fromthe development of compensation schemes, very  little could  be done to encourageexports, though everything should be  done to maintain them as far as possible.The stopping of imports, he continued, was serious, &quot; but, on the other hand, theground lost may be recovered, because on the day when sanctions end we can, if we wish,  once more buy in the best markets, provided we have the money to do so.   Inany case, if we learn to dispense with buying abroad commodities  which weproduce at home, it will be so much gain for the equilibrium of our trade balance.But if people learn to  dispense with  our exports we shall be.  losers, even aftersanctions have been taken off.&quot;                                 (2)  Stocks.    Early in February the Market Supply Committee circulated a translation ofan article by the Rome correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung which, after2-eferring to the comparatively  privileged position  of Rome  from an  economicpoint of view, concluded as follows:  &quot; The  chief reason why  Italy seems to be spared the  worst  effects of sanctions  in day-to-day affairs is the  existence ofconsiderable stocks.   In the course of the last few years stocks of all kinds havebeen built up largely  for military  reasons.  The interval between the decision infavour of sanctions  and their  application  made , it  possible  for stocks to be considerably extended in both wholesale and  retail trade, with  the ready help offoreign suppliers,.;who saw.that their market in Italy was threatened.   This  was rendered easier by the fact that, in the situation which arose before sanctions came       [13296]&apos;                                                    B 2of the figures for, the last half of 1935 and the first quarter of. 1936 resulted in anaverage monthly expenditure of over 13 million lire.  Perhaps a rather similarfigure should be added for the service of Italy&apos;s external loans.  In addition toall this, allowance needs to be made for the loss of exchange to the United states for the payment of arrears, which is still continuing.    5.   The conclusions drawn from the trade figures and other  data relative tothe balance of  payments should be examined in the light of the League figuresshowing Italian exports of gold.  The latter are not absolutely complete, but theyshow that,  on  balance, Italy exported about 1,406 million lire worth of goldbetween November 1935 and February 1936,  as compared with 1,368 million lireworth  during  the period  November  1934 to February 1935 (which,  however,included  an abnormally  large  shipment  in  November-December).    during january and February 1936 (i.e., when the import embargo began  to become reallyeffective)  the net outflow was 836 million lire, as compared with  323 million lirein the same period of 1935.  For March the comparative figures are 243-2 millionlire (in 1936) and 53-2 (in 1935) : for April 378-1 (in 1936) and 18-7 (in 1935).    6.   Finally, the League statistics, though incomplete in  this  respect, tend toshow that Italy has  to a  considerable extent been able to  purchase in &quot; non-sanctionist &quot; countries (and  principally in the United States) the goods deniedher by the  &apos;&apos; sanctionist  &apos;&apos;  countries under  Proposal  IV.   This particularsanction,  therefore, while  no doubt adding  somewhat to  Italy&apos;s total  externalexpenditure, can hardly, if maintained, be expected to have any material effect onthe general economic  situation  in Italy during the autumn of the present year.
                                      $i,n.; it.:was/easier f,or Italy to, pay for foreign: goods; both because foreign exchangewas  made available and because the rush of foreign importers, to;stock up: withItalian specialities before imports were stopped  facilitated compensation trade.   jjAn article in the Rivista di Politico, Economica concludes that this great building   1up of stocks has been the &quot;principal element in the resistance &quot; to sanctions.  the newspapers continue to print the number of days that the economic siege has. lasted   Iin heavier  print than the date.  Mussolini has declared that on the 365th dayItaly will be as inflexible as on the first, but there is no doubt that if the blockade   Ion Italy really does last, as long as that the difficulties will get much worse. -  The&quot; principal element of resistance &quot; will be worn down,  for sooner or later stocks   \will  become exhausted.     There  is reason to suppose that this is a well-balanced and sound judgment.     Sir E.  Drummond has, moreover, called attention to the important point that the continuation of  sanctions must inevitably result  in time in a failure on Italy&apos;s  part to maintain  her exports even at their present reduced level.During the summer and autumn of last year Italy was  laying in heavy stocks ofmetallic and textile  raw materials; the exhaustion  of these stocks could  hardlycome to be felt, Sir E. Drummond considers, before June  or July of this year at theearliest.  Undoubtedly, however, Italy&apos;s increasing financial difficulties and lossof credit will progressively render it more difficult for her to import even the mose essential raw materials, and since these raw materials are indispensable for herexport trade, this too must,-so long as present conditions last, continue to dwindle.                       (3)  Signor Grandi&apos;s Admission.    On the 28th February Signor Grandi,  in conversation with Mr.  Sargent,himself admitted that, &quot; notwithstanding the assurance which the Italian Govern-ment had to make in order to reassure public opinion in Italy, the application of sanctions had in reality produced very serious effects.  These effects were shownnot so much in immediate  material  shortage, but in the fact  that  the ItalianGovernment, having originally laid their plans about Ethiopia for a war lastingfour years, had had, with the imposition of sanctions, to scrap the whole of these   plans and replace them by  one which would enable  Italy to  terminate the war   [jbefore her gold  supplies were exhausted.   For the duration of the war  was nowdetermined by the length of  time Italy&apos;s gold would hold out. The supply of goldwas larger than we had estimated, and, owing to Italy&apos;s low standard of living and national thrift,  it would  be made to  last longer than we  had  probablycalculated.  But, nevertheless, the time would come when it would be exhausted,and its exhaustion would make further military operations impossible.&quot;                             (4) Gold Reserves.    On the 31st March,  Signor Azzolini,  the  governor of the Bank of Italy,made a statement on the Italian gold reserve which  contained  the only officialfigures on this subject published since October 1935.  According to this statement,the total gold reserve of the bank on the 31st December last was 3,027 million lireplus a &quot;foreign credit&quot; reserve of 367,400,000 an  approximate total of 3-4milliard  or   62 million  sterling  at  55 lire to the  .  This  compared with 4-3milliard lire on the 20th October, the date of the last publication of statistics.  Onthe other hand, Signor Azzolini explained that his figures for the reserve didnot include  &quot; gold offered to the State by voluntary contribution or the sum totalof the means derived from the obligation of all  Italians resident in the kingdom to surrender to the State their mobile foreign credits of every kind.&quot;   The total amount already realised from both these sources is unknown; but  it is probably not less than 1 and  not more than  2 milliard lire. -  The amount which can stillbe realised from foreign credits is even more speculative; but perhaps it  may beput down at from one-half to 1  milliard lire.,:               I v- .&apos;-    On the  basis of  Signor Azzolini&apos;s figures, there was a drain of gold betweenthe 20th  October  and the 31st December, 1935, amounting to.900 million lire,ke.\ about 385 million lire a month.   This  was a definite minimum figure, but itis uncertain whether the- total reserve i during - that period - was i increased  -from further undisclosed  sources, such as purchases by the:Bank of  Italy within the
 kingdom;; If-so, the - reak draiii&apos; would have been pro tanib larger.  While the average1 monthly drain  was,  during the first part of the present year, uncertain, the League figures of gold movements&apos; given in paragraph S (a)&quot; suggest that it was between 350 and 400 million gold lire a month on the  average.  On the other hand, the rate at which gold is lost may be expected to fall  now that the campaign in Ethiopia is virtually over, though the maintenance of a  largenumber of troops in Ethiopia  and its  development may be expected to constitute  a considerable drain on Italy&apos;s resources for some time to come.                   / -    Frotnthtise figures, therefore, the following deductions can&apos;be  drawn, though by the nature of things they are little better than guesses  :                                                             Milliard  lire.         Reserve on December 31, 1935   ...     ...     ...     ...      3-4         Expenditure to end of April 1936 (estimated)      ...      1-8         Add for gold purchases and offerings and for realised             securities    ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ... .    1 to 2    Thus, the  total reserve  at  the end of April last may have been as  low as 2-6 or as high as 3-6 milliard; while there may possibly have been as much as a further milliard still  to be realised from foreign securities.    Without examining in further detail the various calculations and speculations which  have resulted from Signor Azzolinks statement, it may be said that the general opinion is that, allowing for a considerable reduction  in the net outflow of gold and &quot; Devisen &quot; from  the  1st June next  onwards, there is reason to suppose that the Italian gold stock will be becoming dangerously low at the end of the  present year, provided that normal trading relations with other countries are not, in the interval, restored.  It should, moreoyer, be noted that the Italians in any  case cannot afford to allow  their gold stock to come within measurable distance of exhaustion while they  still have hundreds  of thousands of men whosemaintenance in East Africa (to say nothing  of their possible return) involvesexpenditure in gold or  foreign exchange.   In these circumstances (to quote His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome) &quot;the loss of every gold piece represents a step nearer to a position of extreme political and military  danger.&quot;  ,                              (5) Local Reports.    A large number of  reports dealing  with the local  economic situation  invarious parts of Italy have been received from His Majesty&apos;s Embassy and fromconsular officers all over Italy.  In the absence of any statistics, such reports canadmittedly only show which way the wind is blowing, but  the general impressiongiven on reading them is that economic conditions have been rapidly deterioratingin Sicily, the south of Italy and to a certain extent in the centre.  In the norththe great fillip  given to  industry by war preparations (financed by the extra-ordinary expenditure of  11 milliard lire in eleven months or about  600,000 aday) has maintained an artificial prosperity, but even  here there is grave anxietyamong industrialists and all  those in a  position to form; a reasoned judgmentabout what will happen when  the war  boom  for one reason or another comes  toan end.  In Rome itself and the Campagna Roma the position is also exceptional,and this may have deluded certain travellers into thinking that &quot;sanctions havehad no real effect.&quot;   It seems, indeed, that in such districts as Carrara, Genoa,Naples and Palermo distress is acute, while certain industries, notably the textile,are suffering severely.  Phrases such as &quot; a marked reduction in activity &quot;  and&quot;a steady deterioration in economic activity &quot; appear  in reports from such places as Leghorn, and there seems no doubt that in  many other districts there has been an  actual increase in unemployment in  spite of the despatch of hundreds- of thousands! of men to East Africa&apos;and-the mobilisation of several classes for service on  metropolitan territory.   Finally, wholesale  prices  increased very rapidlyduring the period January to November  1935 and slightly between November 1935and April 1936.  There was also an increase of from 20 per dent-  to 30 per cent.in retail prices during 1935, this resulting in a substantial fall in the standardof living.   Contrary to expectation, the latter does not seem to have  fallenappreciably further during the first few months of 1936, but there is little doubtthat;it;will do.so on  the exhaustion of the present supply of stocks.  --&apos; - tectiittl
      &apos;       &apos;          :  (6) Loss of Credit Facilities&apos;  :  .         &apos;      &apos;    There is no doubt at all that the cutting off of credit facilities for Italy by great Britain has had a very grave effect on Italian ability to finance her importsof essential raw materials, except on a cash basis.  This; however, cannot reallybe said to be due to sanctions, as owing to the exchange control policy pursued bythe Italian authorities during the summer of 1935, Italian credit in London was already practically exhausted (the point was examined at length in Appendix 2to Rome despatch No. 1213 E of the 12th November last).  Moreover, of late owingto  the  accumulation  of  indebtedness to  &quot; non-sanctionist &quot;   countries,   e.g.,Germany, Switzerland and Austria), the  ability of Italy to import goods evenfrom  such  countries  as  these, except  in return  for  cash, has been  sensiblydiminished.(s)  It is  evident  that  this  state  of  affairs can  only lead  to  atemporarily increased outflow  of gold to the world generally,  and to  all theaccompanying dangers which have been briefly alluded to above.                                 (7)  General.    In  conclusion, it may be said that all intelligent and well-informed  reports on the existing economic situation and on the effect of sanctions received during recent months contain  some reference to the inevitable inflation which must ensuefrom  the  internal expenditure  of so much money on war preparations,  and tothe problems to be  solved when the  troops return  from Ethiopia, if,  in  fact,the bulk  of  them  ever  do.    Italian  exports have,  in  fact,  for long  been extremely vulnerable more especially so since a number of countries suspendedthe gold  standard and  hence  only able  to compete  with  those  of  morepowerfully  developed  countries at a  disadvantage.  In the  absence of  some adjustment  in  the  external  value  of  the  lira, this  disadvantage  mustnecessarily increase as internal inflation  develops.   Further, unless she can soreadapt her industry as to pass over  from war production to competitive peaceproduction, it seems (to quote His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome) inevitable that within a few weeks of demobilisation there will be (a) a return to the unemploy-ment  level of January  1935, and (b) the indefinite continuation of a deficit month by month  in the international payments balance to be made good willy-nilly  from such stocks of gold  and &quot; Devisen &quot; as may remain. It follows that, even if apolitical settlement  is arrived at  to-morrow, Italy  will (in the words of Sir E.Drummond) &apos;&apos; re-enter an unsympathetic economic world with a broken exchange,a vanishing gold reserve,  a heavy  unpaid bill for arrears, a disorganised foreign trade and an unbalanced budget.   Her  only asset will be the desire  of hercreditors  to maintain  her solvency and her  power  to make use of the inflationweapon, neither of which promise the assurance of immediate support.&quot;                           III.-CONCLUSION.    It is now possible to make  certain suggestions regarding the effect whichsanctions are  likely to have if maintained for another three or four months :     (i) Whatever their political  advantage to Italy in unifying the nation, it isquite  clear that sanctions have had a serious economic effect and have intensifiedthe already existing deterioration in the economic position of Italy as a whole.    (ii)  It is therefore clear that the mere removal of sanctions, while undoubtedlyalleviating Italy&apos;s foreign exchange position to a considerable extent, would not of itself  remove the inherent weakness in the Italian economy which  was partly responsible for the deterioration referred to above.    (iii)  If, nevertheless, the &quot;sanctions front &quot; is allowed to crumble and Italypermitted to make the best bargain she can with one country at a time (and wehave reason to believe from a recent telegram that this is what she will try to do),the position  can  probably be held for some time without  undue distress, moreespecially if  the  Italian authorities are able to secure some form  of credits orloan.    (3) According to  an unconfirmed report transmitted from Rome in&apos;February, Italy had agreedto pay  in gold for. approximately 35 per  cent, of her supplies from Germany. -   ;
     (iv)  If, on the other hand, sanctions are lifted en bloc and at the same time it is found practicable to maintain some  sort of &quot; creditors  front &quot; (which  is most unlikely) with a view to recovering as much as possible of existing Italianindebtedness, and if no loan or credits are forthcoming, the position would begraver, though it would no doubt be wrong to suppose that the Italian  Govern-ment could not find ways and means of  carrying on on the basis  of  a lowerstandard of living.     (v)  If,  finally, existing sanctions  are maintained in their entirety  (and taking only purely economic considerations  into account),  the  conclusion  can hardly be avoided  that the position will have undergone a substantial further deterioration by mid-September and be becoming very grave towards the end ofthe year.  The  cumulative effect of (a) exhaustion of  stocks, (b) depletion of thegold reserve, and (c) the complete breakdown  of all credit  facilities,  coupledperhaps with the return of some soldiers  and workmen from  East Africa, will present a problem which, as far as one can see at the moment, can only be solved by some  thorough-going socialisation and demilitarisation of the country andby heavy reduction  in an already low standard of living, or by  a war.
