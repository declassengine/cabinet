THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT                                                      iPrinted for the Cabinet.  May 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 134 (36).CABINET.POSITION OF  THE  FLEET  IN  THE  EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN.              Memorandum by the First  Lord of the Admiralty.    AT  the  Meeting of  the Cabinet  on  the  13th  May -(Cabinet  36  (36),Conclusion 3), I raised the question of the position of the Fleet in the eastern mediterranean, and it was agreed that this  should  be considered at a special meeting on the 18th May.    The point to which I desire to call particular attention is the position whichis arising in connection with the personnel of  the Navy.  The basis on which theNavy is manned is that ships on  foreign stations recommission every two to two-and-a-half years,  and that care is  taken, so  far as possible,  to  give the personnel  their fair share of home and foreign service.   The method of recom-missioning ships at intervals not only enables these changes to be made, but alsoenables men to be withdrawn from  sea service for training in the schools andother work that has to be carried out ashore.    In order  to enable  the routine of the  Navy, recommissionings, &amp;c,  to becarried out, a small margin of personnel has always been maintained.  Whenthe present state of emergency arose, in  order  to  implement the policy  of theGovernment,  it was necessary for a  considerable  number of ships to  be commis-sioned  and for services to be provided, such  as Base  Defences, other than thosewhich  are normally maintained in  peace-time.  At the same time, mobilisationwas not possible, and in  consequence the commitments had to be met out of the margin, which was completely absorbed.    The state of emergency was not expected to last for long, but it has continued for nine months, and in  spite of the adoption of various  palliatives such as there-entry of a  certain number  of men, there is to-day practically no margin onwhich to work to keep the normal routine of recommissionings,  &amp;c, going.    The time has now arrived when, if this makeshift arrangement is continued,it must have  serious  effects on the  future efficiency  of the  Fleet,  especially aswe are now entering on a period of expansion of naval personnel.  During  sucha period the problems of training become even more important than usual.  Unlessthe normal flow of changes can be restarted, it is not possible to provide for the adequate training of  the individual, and this cannot but have  a bad effect notonly  on the prospects of  the men, but on the  future of the Navy.  We  are nowdefinitely behindhand in  the training of men for  their various Specialist duties,whereas in view of the coming expansion, the  reverse  should be  the ease.  unless some steps are taken, there will, in the future, be insufficient trained men to  manthe new construction as it comes into service.    Apart from  all these  reasons  affecting  efficiency, there is  the question ofthe hardship to the personnel.  We are not at war, and,  cheerfully and loyallyas the personnel have accepted the unusual conditions  which  prevail in  theMediterranean, there is  no  doubt  that the men who are due for home servicebut are retained abroad feel keenly the separation from their families.  Thoughevery possible opportunity in the future will be given to  make  up this  home service, it will not be possible to do this fully without  creating similar conditionsby keeping other ships&apos; companies longer than their normal time abroad.       [13221]
    The situation must be solved now in one of two ways :     (1) That our  commitments  in the Mediterranean should be liquidated and           the  Fleet thereby enabled to return to its normal peace-time routine         &apos;  of recommissionings  and training.                           h 7 ;h;    (2) That it should be recognised that though we are not at war, the Fleet is           being kept on a war  footing, and the Admiralty should be authorised           to call  up sufficient  reserve men to  enable them again to place the           manning situation on a satisfactory basis.    The Admiralty have the power  to call up Pensioners without the issue of a royal Proclamation.  There are some 27,000 of these men available, and a small -proportion of these (say, 6,000,  but the actual number taken up would naturally be kept as low as possible) will be sufficient to enable the situation to be put right.It should be borne in mind that the ratings entered for  the emergency  (3,500authorised,  3,436  (including  340 Officers)  actually obtained)  include  a largeproportion of men serving for one year only.  These will shortly be leaving.  Inany case, they  are now all absorbed in the  estimated requirements of personnel(Vote A) for the current year.  This Vote does not allow for the extra  commit-ments in the Mediterranean, which, in spite of reductions  already made by thepaying off of 4 Battleships, still amount to  3,854 men.    The reason for requiring  a greater number  now  than was asked for  inSeptember, is that in September the whole  of the drafting margin, about 7,000.was utilised for service at home or  abroad.  It is essential that this draftingmargin should  now be  re-established for the purpose of training, welfare andto enable New Construction to be manned.    The calling up of the Pensioners would  no doubt cause comment, as themajority will be in permanent employment, but the Admiralty consider that unless the  other alternative of  liquidating the  position in the Mediterraneancan be adopted, it is essential in the interests of the future, of the Royal Navythat the situation  should be faced and the necessary action taken with the least possible  delay.    It  is very  distasteful for the Admiralty to be continually  asking for  aneasing of the naval position, and I should be sorry if any  feeling were  to growup in consequence that the Admiralty were raising unnecessary difficulties;  buthowever willing the Navy  is to  do all that is required of it, or more, we cannot make bricks without straw, and  nine months on a war footing without mobilisa-tion is more than even the most willing administration can cope with without help.                                                                       M.Admiralty, May 14, 1936.
