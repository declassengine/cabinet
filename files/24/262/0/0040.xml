Offices of  Secretary of State and  Parliamentary Under  Secretary                           of State for Burma.      MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.    Both I and my predecessor have always  contemplated that, when Burma&quot;, isseparated from India, there should be a Secretaryship  of  State for  Burma as wellas  for India, the two  offices being held  by the same person, and  that a  similar arrangement should be made for the Parliamentary Under Secretaryship.    When the Secretaryship of State  for Dominion  Affairs  was created in 1925  itwas decided that  no legislation was needed.   The Prime Minister made  a brief statement in the  house of Commons in reply to a Private Notice  question, and  anOrder-in-Council was issued ordering the preparation of  additional Seals for theOffice of His Majesty&apos;3 Principal Secretary of State.  Parliament had  an opportunityof discussing the arrangement on the presentation of a Supplementary Estimate fora new Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.    The decision that no legislation was required was based upon two memoranda by  Parliamentary Counsel.    In the first he advised that legislation would  be  necessary only if any statutory powers or duties imposed upon the Secretary of State for the Colonies eo  nomine,or any property or rights enjoyed by, or liabilities imposed upon him  eo nomine, hadto be transferred to the Secretary of State under his new title or distributed betweenthe old Colonial Secretary and the new Dominions Secretary.  In the present caseno question  of such transfer or distribution can  arise, since  throughout the new government of India Act and the Government of Burma Act reference is invariablymade to &quot;The Secretary of State,&quot; and  all rights and liabilities, &amp;c, under bothActs, whether new or continued from  the old  regime, will  appertain  to &quot; HisMajesty&apos;s  Principal Secretary of State,&quot; without qualification.    In his second memorandum Parliamentary Counsel expressed the opinion  in1925, that for the purpose of the statutory  provisions limiting the number  ofSecretaries of  State  who may sit in  the House of Commons at  the same time,  aperson holding conjointly two Secretaryships of State could not on that account bedeemed to be two persons.   There appears to be nothing in the language of section 3of the Secretaries  of State Act, 1926 (which raised  the number of  Secretaries  ofState who may sit in the  Commons  to  six, to meet the case of  the creation of  a secretary  of State for Scotland), that would invalidate this opinion.    It is his opinion, similarly, that a person holding the two offices of parliamentary under Secretary of State for India and  Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for burma could  not  be treated  as two Under  Secretaries for  the purpose  of theGovernment of India Act,  1858, which as amended prohibits more than six UnderSecretaries sitting in the House of Commons  simultaneously.   This opinion  isborne out by  the  language  of  section  1 of the House of Commons (Vacation  of seats) Act, 1864, as amended, which provides that &quot;if at any time when Six of the under Secretaries for the time being to His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretaries of Stateare Members of the House of Commons, any other Person, being a Member of that house, accepts the Office of  Under Secretary of State to any of the  said PrincipalSecretaries, the Election of such person shall be and the same is hereby declared  tobe void, and a writ shall be issued for a new Election.&quot;   The question of the necessity of re-election, should  the  Secretary of State be  amember of the Commons when offered the new portfolio for Burma, which was also discussed  in 1925 in connection with the Dominions Office case, cannot arise again,in view of  the  terms of  the  Re-election of Ministers  Act  (1919)  amendment act, 1926.   Parliamentary Counsel  concur in the above statement of the position.     4860    75 6.36   [This Document is the  Property  of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                     Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1936.SECRET.CP. 150(36).                                                Copy No....Sfe.C?.. -                                 CABINET.
   Although this proposal would not have effect until the separation of Burmafrom  India  takes place, I think that Parliament should know what is  intendedbefore estimates are presented next January for the  Departments of the Secretaryof State for  India and the Secretary of State for Burma.  An appropriate  time  for making an  announcement would  be shortly before the  debate  takes  place inParliament on the Commencement and Transitory Provisions Orders-iu-Council  forIndia and for Burma.  Parliament would then have  an opportunity of discussing the new arrangements during that debate.   This announcement should,  I suggest, as on the occasion  of the creation of  theSecretaryship of State for Dominion Affairs, be made  by the Prime Minister in replyto a  Private Notice question.  But  as the  arrangement proposed  involves  theexercise of the  Royal Prerogative, I  suggest that it should be submitted to  HisMajesty before an announcement is made.                                                                        Z.  INDIA OFFICE,        3rd June 1936.
