THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  April 1936.SECREL                                                         COPY  No-C.P. 121  (36).CABINET.                               GERMANY.    I CIRCULATE to my colleagues two important despatches from Sir EricPhipps.    In No. 373 I would particularly draw attention to paragraphs  4, 5 and 6,which show that the youth of Germany is being imbued with the idea of expansionboth east  and west.  The  position is  well summed up by  the  quotation  fromHerr Streicher given in the final sentence of the despatch.    Paragraph 9 of No. 384 indicates that there is really no moderate party inGermany (any more than there is in Japan).  I think it is true to  say that in both countries there are two sets  of people who wish to arrive  at the same end at different rates.    Paragraph 13  of this  despatch  confirms the often expressed apprehensionthat Germany  favours  the bilateral as opposed to the  multilateral (League)system of treaties, because  it would obviously suit her book if a  conflict betweenherself and a small State were localised.    These despatches present a gloomy view of the future  for Europe.  I fear that any rosier view  would  be  illusory.  They will not, of course, make any difference  to  our  intention to probe and explore Herr Hitler&apos;s  offers  and toconstruct,  if possible, something reliable out of them.    But we should not be under any illusion as to the aims than underlie german policy.  The Germany of to-day (and, I fear, of to-morrow, in view of the forcesof miseducation which are  perverting her youth) has no intention of respecting the integrity of her smaller  neighbours, no matter what  papers she may sign.There will always be the mental reservation that national interests override treaty obligations.    We must, I submit, shape our policy and  preparations according to facts,however hard and unpleasant, to which we cannot close our eyes,  and  at the sametime endeavour to educate  our own public to a realisation  of these  facts.   the abyssinian dispute can only accelerate the speed of events, and it seems to memore  than ever necessary  to do all  we can to increase the tempo  of our  ownre-equipment.                                                                    A. E.    Foreign Office, April 25, 1936.[C 2872/4/18]              Sir E. Phipps to Mr. Eden. (Received April 11.)(No.  373.)Sir,                                                  Berlin, April 7, 1936.    IN his speech in the Reichstag on the 21st May, 1935, Herr Hitler said :          &quot; Germany  has solemnly recognised  and guaranteed  to France  the    frontier resulting in accordance with the Saar plebiscite.  Regardless of the    past, Germany has concluded a non-aggression pact with Poland, as a further    more  than  valuable contribution to European peace.   We shall not  only      8560   [13127]                                               B
2     adhere to it implicitly, but we cherish the one wish that it may continually     be prolonged, and that it may tend to an ever-deepening friendship in our     mutual&apos;relations.         &quot;We have done all  this, although we thereby,  for  instance, finally    ..renounce Alsace-Lorraine,  a land for which we have fought two great wars.     But we have done it, in particular, to spare our own German nation in the  ,   future a new sacrifice of lives. We are  convinced  that in so doing we are     benefiting  most of  all  not only  our own  people, but  also  this  frontier     territory.&quot;        .         .......                   -     2.  In his speech in the Reichstag  on  the  7th March,  1936,  Herr Hitlersaid :          &apos;&apos; In the last three years I have endeavoured slowly but surely to create     the necessary conditions for a Franco-German understanding.   I have never     allowed  a  doubt  to  arise that one of the necessary conditions of  such an     understanding is absolute equality of rights and thus the same legal status for     the two  peoples and States.   But I have deliberately regarded this under-     standing not only as a problem which is to be solved by means of  pacts, but     as a  problem which must be  psychologically brought close to both  nations,     since its solution must be prepared not only in the heads but in the hearts of     the people. ....         &quot; In this sense  I have done more than  any upright foreign  statesman     was ever entitled to hope.  I removed the eternal question of  European     frontier  revision  out of the atmosphere  of  public  discussion in  Germany.     Unfortunately, people too often take up the standpoint particularly foreign     statesmen that this action was of no particular importance.   I would like     to point  out that it would have been just  as easy for me as a German to put     forward as my programme the recovery of the frontiers  of  1914 and to     support  it in speech and  in writing as  it was for French  Ministers  and     popular  leaders in  the  year  1871.   My  critics should not deny me  some     capacity in this respect. Indeed, it is far more difficult for a Nationalist to     preach understanding to his people than to do the reverse.  And it would     probably have been easier for me to arouse the desire for &apos; revanche &apos; than to     awaken a feeling for the necessity of European understanding  continuously     and to strengthen that feeling.  And this I have  done.  For I have freed     German  public opinion  from  attacks of  this kind  against our neighbours.     I have removed from the German press every expression of hatred for the     French people.  I have endeavoured to awaken understanding  amongst our     young people for an ideal of such an  understanding,  and certainly not     without  success.  When a few weeks  ago the French guests entered the     Olympic Stadium at Garmisch they had an opportunity of realising  how far     I had  succeeded in bringing about the change in German sentiment.&quot;     3.  In the Peace Plan of&apos; the German Government  of the 31st March,  1936,handed to  you  by Herr  von Ribbentrop  on the 1st April, the fifteenth proposalreads as follows :          &quot; (15) In  order to stamp this peace  pact, voluntarily  entered  into     between  Germany on the one hand and France   on  the  other, with the     character of a reconciliatory settlement of centuries-old  variance, Germany     and France shall pledge themselves to see that in the education  of the young     people of both countries, as well  as in publications, everything is  avoided     which might be calculated to poison the relationship  between the two peoples,     whether it be  the adoption of a derogatory or contemptuous attitude, or     improper interference in the internal affairs of the other country. They shall     agree  to set up, at the headquarters of the League  of Nations in  Geneva, a     joint commission whose function it shall be to submit to the two Governments,     for their information and investigation, all complaints received.&quot;     4.  In the face of these declarations, it is of  interest to consider how far theGerman schools, in which, under  the National Socialist regime, politics play alarge part, are following the Chancellors lead.  It is difficult to give a precisereply,  because schools vary, there is  ho publicity, and  a  general  picture  is
b ptherefore unobtainable.  Such indications, however, as I have been able to obtainare not encouraging, and in particular show that Herr Hitler&apos;s renunciation of alsace-Lorraine has not reached the schools.   On the contrary, they are teachingthat it is as much &apos;&apos; terra irredenta &apos;&apos;  as any other German territory.    5.  His Majesty&apos;s consul-general at Munich reports on the 31st March, 1936,that children attending the Gebelle School at Munich have been told that war willoccur  in  1937 or  1938 and  that  Germany will regain her  pre-war might andassimiliate all Europe.  He adds that members of the Hitler Youth have forsome time received similar instruction.    6.  A book which has a wide circulation  and which exercises a considerable influence is a text-book for the Hitler Youth  entitled Hitler Jug end im Dienst,issued by the Central Office of the Hitler Youth Organisation,  with a prefaceby Herr Baldur von Schirach.  The date  of publication is not given, but I am informed that it has only recently appeared.  On pp. 314 and 315 may be found the following passage :          &apos;&apos; Amongst the long expeditions,  those to the frontier and abroad play    an important part.  They serve  the  great task of maintaining or, where    necessary, renewing the contact of Germans abroad with the homeland.   One-    third of all the Germans live outside our frontiers.  The Dictate of Versailles    has torn from the motherland completely German territory, Alsace-Lorraine,    West Prussia,  Memelland, Upper Silesia,  &amp;c.....The  German Reich    can in its present situation only lend limited assistance to its Germans abroad.    But  the youth can, without prejudicing the  present policy, build bridges to    their German brethren over the frontier and by their visits show them that    the German Reich has  not forgotten  them.&quot;    7.   The National-Sozialistische Erziehung is a  periodical which is not on public sale, but which is compulsorily subscribed to by the members of the national socialist  Teachers&apos;  Union.   Its articles are intended to form the basis for thepolitical  education  given in the  schools.  In its issue of the 28th March thefollowing passage appears  in an  article over the signature  of an  official of theNational Socialist Teachers&apos; Union :-          &quot; The basic fact of Germany&apos;s fate to-day is that of the nation without    room.  It is incomparably more important for the maintenance and improve-    ment of the  standard  of living  of the  community   than  any  possibly    unjustifiable inequality among the citizens of that community.  This means    that it is not equality or class struggles and  not bourgeois-liberal economics    which can  restore social equity in Germany, but only an attack, along the    whole line, at the problem of Germany&apos;s future.         &quot; Let the pupils of the middle classes of the national schools be shown    a map.  Let them seek  and find Danzig, Vienna, Strasburg and Bozen-four    conceptions of  German history and German  culture they do not belong to    Germany.  Let them answer the question  whether anything of the sort exists    for any  other  nation,  viz., that towns  and provinces  which  most clearly    represent a particular  nationality and are sacred to that nationality should    not belong to it politically and are culturally  in  distress, if  not in actual    decay.  Let this be hammered into the boys, let their appreciation of  it be    increased from year to year  so that  when they grow up it will form the    foundation of their entire political thought.         &apos;&apos; Let  the  pupils be asked if they know of any two or  more French,    English or Russian States with  mutually hostile  interests.    Let them say    &apos; No,&apos; but there are two such  German  States (the Reich  and Austria);  there    is Holland, which centuries  ago  belonged to the Reich, but then, breaking    apart, found its own way.  Even by itself,  and although only a small German    country, it was so strong that at  one  time it was able to play the part of a    world Power.   There is also a German Switzerland, whose history was^ more    or less the same.         &quot; 300,000 German  men  are under arms in  the  countries neighbouring    Germany, that  is to say, three times the  number of the German army  until    recently.&quot;      [13127]                                                  .

    8.  Herr Streicher, speaking during the recent election campaign to enemiesor luke-warm supporters of the Government, made a significantly true statementwhen he said :  &quot; When this day is over [i.e., election day], you may, as far as Iam concerned, quietly bleat.  It is a fact, the German, no matter what happens,never is and neA^er will be satisfied.&quot;                                                    I  have, &amp;c.                                                         ERIC  PHIPPS.[C 2844/4/18]              Sir E. Phipps to Mr. Eden. (Received April 11.)(No. 384.)Sir,                                                Berlin, April 9,  1936.    I HAVE the honour to transmit to you,  herewith, a copy of memorandumby the military attache to this Embassy, recording views held by members of theGerman General  Staff, as expressed in conversation, on the crisis arising out ofthe occupation of the demilitarised zone and on German expansion in the future.    2.  I would call your special attention to Colonel Hotblack&apos;s observation atthe end of paragraph 9 of his memorandum to the effect that the steadying actionof the German army is one of time rather than of principle.  Pessimistic as this may sound, I am convinced of its truth.   In other words,  we must face the alter-natives  of the development of a policy of aggression by Germany brought about by Plerr Hitler before her complete readiness, or of the development of such apolicy at a later date when the army, feeling itself ripe for action, gives the wordto go.                                                    I have, &amp;c.                                                         ERIC PHIPPS.                                 Enclosure.       Memorandum respecting the  Views of the German General Staff.    OFFICERS of the German General Staff continue to be anxious to hear of theviews of Great Britain in the present crisis; but owing to the fact that Herr Hitlernow has the whole matter in his own hands it is impossible for the General staff to give much information.    I have had the opportunity for a considerable number of private conversations and I think that the  views of the General Staff are as  follows :     2.  They opposed the action taken by Herr Hitler on the 7th March becausethey considered that Germany was thereby running a risk of war owing to  theunprepared state of her fighting forces; such a risk, they considered, would havebeen very greatly reduced in two or three years&apos;  time; even one year  would makea considerable difference.    3.  Although they consider it most undesirable,  from their point of view,that such action should have the result of increasing any ties  between GreatBritain and France,  they do  not  consider that any  form of negotiation could possibly have given them the complete freedom of action in the Rhineland whichis their objective; they say it is obvious that France would not willingly give upsuch a military asset and that Germany had nothing military to offer in return.    4.  Now that such action has, however, been taken, they do not consider thatit would serve  any useful purpose if further one-sided restrictions  were placed upon Germany, for it is obvious that Germany, sooner or later, would make anotherattempt to obtain equality on the Rhineland and that inevitably France would continue to be distrustful and suspicious.    5.  With regard to the interim period, I think that the German General staff would probably be prepared to  make concessions with respect to not beginningfortifications, because they have come to realise the difficulty of the British positionand also: because  they  hope  to avoid  a commencement of Anglo-French staff conversations.
     6.  In spite of all the official and non-official statements that have been madeon the subject,  the officers of the German General Staff are very  suspicious ofthese conversations.   This, no doubt, is, in part, due to the very wide conception of &quot; defence,&quot; which is now, and for many years has been, current in Germany.Germany&apos;s military opinion considers that her central position necessitates  that,on the threat of war, she should take rapid action against  one or other of herprospective enemies.  This doctrine of anticipating attack by military  measureshas become so general and deep-seated that it is hard for German  General  staff officers to believe that Franco-British conversations envisage only a situation inwhich no action  is taken until after Francexor Belgium have actually been attacked.by Germany.     Moreover, they consider that such conversations are so much desired by Francethat she may prefer to continue and  develop  them rather  than to sign a non-aggression pact  on terms of equality with Germany and the other Locarno States.     7.  It would appear that the policy of bringing the Germanic populations ofMemelland,  Czechoslovakia  and Austria into the German Empire  is considered at present to be the task of the National Socialist party rather &apos;than that of thearmy.   German General Staff officers say that Herr Hitler considers that after afew years of quiet and economic improvement Germany will exercise an enormousattractive power on these Germanic populations, and that opportunities will occurof &apos;&apos; regaining &quot; such populations with little  or no bloodshed.     8.  In the  first  case any  actual fighting  that may be  necessary would becarried out by the National Socialist party organisations and not  by the army;the task of Germany&apos;s fighting forces is to deter other nations  from interfering with this course of events.     The German General Staff do not believe  that the prospects of carrying thisout  without a grave  risk of a European war  are good; they are,  further, very anxious that  action should not  be taken which risks war until the fighting forces are far more  ready than they are  at present.   In addition to the major reason of avoiding  being  committed to war  before  they are ready, there is  the  furtherreason to avoid being forced by the march of events unduly to hasten the building up of  the fighting services; this particularly applies  to the intake of  officers.The army wishes only to accept such officers who are considered, from the pointof view of character and position, to be suitable,  and they are prepared to be short of officers  for a few years whilst large numbers of good type young officers are being trained.  The  National Socialist party, however,  would like the army to accept as officers large numbers of party members.     9.  To most German officers  the idea that Germany must expand eastwardsis accepted as a matter  of  course and as  an  entirely justifiable one; many areeager to play their part in taking a further step in that series of developments ofPrussia in which their ancestors distinguished themselves.  The steadying actionof the German army is one of time rather than principle.     10.  Most German officers  consider that Great Britain has a real interest in defending the neutrality of the Low Countries, but that she has not justifiableinterest in preventing the joining up of  Germanic  populations on Germany&apos;snorth-eastern and south-eastern frontiers, or even opposing a German expansionstill further eastwards.     11.  In spite of some anxiety with regard to Herr Hitlehs methods, and inspite of a considerable dislike of  many members of the National Socialist party,the German army as  a whole has an enormous respect  for Herr Hitler himself.They consider that he has worked wonders in building  up the fighting  forces soquickly and in avoiding so far any restrictions, either qualitative or quantitive,for the army  or  air force.     12.  With regard to the new  Locarno,  of twenty-five years&apos; duration, I thinkthat the  German General Staff have no desire to break this as long as there is good prospect of Germany&apos;s being able to make some progress eastwards.     13.  With regard to  pacts with countries on Germany&apos;s north-eastern andsouth-eastern frontiers, they consider that separate pacts with each individualcountry are right and proper since &quot; in the event of anything happening, action might be localised and a  European war avoided.&quot;     14.  My  impression is that as far as any  public opinion exists in Germany,its views are similar to those of  the army; action in the west which might produceanother war with England is wrong, whereas a joining-up with Germanic peoplesin the east, in the words of  a German Minister of State, is  clearly  the  &quot;will ofGod.&quot;
    15.  With regard  to  colonies,  I  am  unable to ascertain the  views  of theGerman  General  Staff; I think that officers hold divergent opinions; it is clear,however, that they all desire that at the present moment  their claim to colonies should be represented as being extremely modest  and no threat to the British.    16.  In view of the extremely nationalistic views held throughout Germanyit  is not easy to believe that modesty could prevail for very long, unless theenergies of Germany were  fully absorbed in a struggle eastwards.                                                ELLIOT HOTBLACK,                                                          Military A attache.April 6, 1936.
