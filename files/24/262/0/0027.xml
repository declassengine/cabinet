THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYmmENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  May 1936.SECRET.Copy No.  43CP. 137  (36).CABINET.THE  IMPERIAL  CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.    IN accordance with the Conclusions  of  the Cabinet  (Cabinet  24  (36),Conclusion No. 7) of  the 25th March on  my Memorandum CP. 77 (36), steps have been taken to ascertain the views of the Dominions and India regarding thedate for the next  Imperial Conference.    From the correspondence which has taken place it is clear that a Conferenceat the time of the Coronation next year would be generally acceptable, save thatthe reply  received from  the  Irish Free State  indicated that &quot; in the presentcircumstances the Government of the Irish  Free State are not in a position tomake any comment on the proposal.&apos;&apos;    The Dominion Prime Ministers have been informed, confidentially, that thedate now proposed for the Coronation is the 12th May, 1937.  The question arises whether the  meetings of  the  Conference  should begin  before  or after  the coronation.    So far as the Dominions are concerned, it would  appear that  New Zealandhas no preference in the matter, whilst Canada  (who for her own Parliamentaryreasons would have preferred the Coronation to take place late in May) and theUnion of South Africa (who for similar reasons would have preferred it to takeplace in June, or at any rate as late as possible in May) would find it more suitablethat the meetings of the Conference should follow the  Coronation.  The positionin Australia is, however, different.   The  Commonwealth Government expresslyasked in their reply to my telegram that, if possible, the meetings should be held before the Coronation, the position being  that their General Election is  due totake place in the autumn of next year, and that  their Ministers will therefore be anxious to return  to Australia as soon as possible after the Coronation, to prepare for the contest.    I discussed the matter informally  with Dr. Earle Page and  Mr.  Menzies,who are now in  London, and  endeavoured to persuade  them to advise their colleagues  in favour  of Conference meetings following  the Coronation.   As aresult of further communications, however, the Commonwealth Government sentthem a telegram saying that  the holding of a Conference  after the Coronationwould be unsuitable to them,  and that unless a date before the Coronation was fixed they  would prefer that the Conference should be postponed until early in1938.  They suggested  that the Prime Ministers concerned could confer informallyon national and urgent matters,  and that these conversations  would clear  theway for a full-dress Conference in the following year.    There are three great objections to this proposal:        (i) It is very unlikely that Dominion Prime  Ministers generally would be          prepared to make a second visit  to London in 1938 if they have already          made one in 1937.     (ii) The next Election in the Union  of South Africa  is due in May 1938,          so that presumably the South Africans  definitely could not  come.    (iii) Opinion in this country would be critical  of  any  further postponement.          of the  next Imperial Conference.[13226]
    Quite apart from the views of Canada and the Union of South Africa, from our own point of view also, I imagine that it would  be much more convenient tohave the full meetings of the Conference after the Coronation, when  the timeof Ministers and officials will not be  occupied with the preparations  for that event.    We  could  go some  way  to  meet the Australian  objection by  expressingwillingness, so far as we were concerned,  that any preliminary work that can bedone between officials should be done before the Coronation, and Dr. Earle Pagethinks that it would be possible for some  of their officials to arrive ahead of  themain  delegation for this purpose.  Now that the  Coronation  is to be held on aWednesday, it  should also be possible  to arrange for  the holding of  the firstformal meeting of the Conference before the end of that week, on (say) the Fridaymorning.   From the point of view of helping the  Australians to overcome their objections,  it is unfortunate  that the  following  week is Whit Week; I have emphasised to Dr.  Earle Page the great importance to Ministers of the briefrespite at  that period of the year from  Parliamentary and,  if possible, other duties, and held out no hope that a further meeting of the Conference  could beheld until,  at the earliest, the end of that  week.  But on that assumption, and inview of the fact that we hope to avoid on this occasion the protracted  discussions on constitutional and economic problems which have marked recent Conferences,I have suggested to him that it should be possible for the Conference to close, and australian Ministers to leave this country, by the middle of June.    If I can assure them that we shall  do everything possible to complete  thepreliminary work before the Coronation,  and to expedite the proceedings afterthe Whitsun recess, I think  it  may be  possible  to secure the  commonwealth governments agreement to  this proposal.   I should  like, therefore,   to have authority definitely to propose to  the Dominions that the meeting of the  ImperialConference should  be fixed to  take  place  as soon as  practicable after  the coronation, and to give the above assurances to Australia.    India, I understand, whilst agreeing to a Conference at the time of  the coronation, has expressed no  preference  as to dates. A similar communication to that sent to the Dominions would, no doubt, be sent to India.    The position as regards Southern  Rhodesia is that her participation in  theImperial Conference on the lines  suggested in paragraph 14 of my memorandum cp. 77 (36) has now  been agreed to generally, and the way, therefore, is nowopen to issue an invitation to Southern Rhodesia accordingly.    I should perhaps raise at this point the question of preparations for  the workof the Conference.  The  method  previously adopted  has been     (1) The  establishment  of inter-departmental committees to discuss  and           prepare memoranda for distribution to  the Dominions, and briefs for           Ministers  here,  on the  various  questions  likely  to come  up  for           consideration; and    (2) The  establishment of a Ministerial  Cabinet Committee to (a)  consider           further  the Conference Agenda; (&amp;) supervise  the  work of the inter-           departmental  committees; (c)  sanction memoranda and briefs; and           (d) make recommendations to  the  Cabinet on any questions of policy           arising.    This procedure has  worked satisfactorily in the past,  and I would suggestthat we should  adopt a similar procedure  in the present case.    The inter-departmental committees appointed on the last occasion  (in 1930)were three     (a) A  committee on  foreign policy and defence questions;    (b) A committee on questions affecting inter-Imperial relations in the political           and constitutional fields.  (There is already a Standing Committee on           these  subjects under  the chairmanship  of  Sir G.  Mounsey of  the           Foreign Office);    (c) A  committee on economic questions.    It seems likely that  all these inter-departmental committees will be required on  the present occasion.  The economic  committee,  as well as considering  anygeneral economic subjects which might arise, at the Conference, should also, I
                                    3                             .   15$think, deal with any matters arising out of the Ottawa Agreements, although we hope that  any questions of revision may be settled in the proposed bilateral dis-cussions with individual Dominions, apart from the Imperial Conference itself.   I might add that since the last meeting of the Imperial Conference questions con-nected with Communications (Aviation, Broadcasting, Shipping, Telegraphy andTelephony) have been the subject of much discussion with the Dominions.   So faras the United Kingdom is concerned, however, any necessary inter-departmentalpreliminary  preparations  can,  for  the most part,  be  covered by the existing machinery.    I suggest that the Cabinet should agree to the appointment of a ministerial committee forthwith, and should approve the establishment of inter-departamental committees as required.
