THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT133Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1936.SECRET.CP. 136 (36).CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATY  NEGOTIATIONS.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    ITEM (b) of the Cabinet Conclusions 35 (36) of the 11th May, 1936, sets outthat it was agreed that the Foreign Office should revise the various  documents in the light of the discussion which  took place that  day, and more particularly on the basis of CP. 131 (36), paragraph 4 (the Conciliation Commission).  Thisentailed the preparation of instructions to His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner in cairo, informing him (i) that His Majesty&apos;s Government were unable to agreeto the inclusion  in the treaty of any provision giving power  to the Council ofthe League of Nations (when  the time came for the conclusion of a new treaty to take  the place of the one under negotiation) to settle the terms of the new treaty which relate to the position  and number  of  British  troops required todefend  the Canal  in  the  absence of an agreement between the ContractingParties;  (ii) that His Majesty&apos;s Government required the inclusion in  the articlecorresponding to Article 9 of the 1930  draft or in some other suitable positionearlier in the treaty of the following provision :          &quot; In view of the position of His Britannic Majesty in relation to the    Suez Canal, His Majesty  The King of Egypt recognises that His Britannic    Majesty may, through the Commanders of his forces, take  all steps necessary    for the maintenance and  security of, and of  freedom of navigation  in, the    said Canal.&quot;and (iii) that His Majesty&apos;s Government considered it necessary to secure from theEgyptian Government  a recognition  of  permanent British interests in relationto the Suez Canal.    2.  As regards (i) above, I feel it my duty once more to remind my colleagues that Sir M. Lampson has repeatedly  expressed the opinion that no treaty which did not contain a provision for reference to the League of Nations in the circum-stances contemplated would be possible to negotiate with the Egyptian Govern-ment. Insistence on the omission of such a provision would then almost certainlyentail a breakdown of the negotiations, and that because  of a demand  on thepart of His Majesty&apos;s Government which would certainly be considered unreason-able in  Egypt  and  elsewhere and  which might  not be generally considered as reasonable in this country.   The probable consequences of a breakdown insuch circumstances have already been set out in previous papers laid  before mycolleagues.  I consider  them to be  such that His  Majesty&apos;s Government  shouldnot incur the risk of having to  face them.  The attention of my colleagues isfurther  drawn  to the  fact that Sir M. Lampson  and his  advisers in these discussions, as well as  Nahas  Pasha, urge most strongly that the matter of an anglo-Egyptian  Treaty should be approached in a. broad manner. Sir M. Lampsonlaid stress in a telegram of the 13th  May on the point that the present circum-stances,  when the Egyptians are evincing a spirit of considerable goodwill  and,in his opinion, a real  and new  desire for a treaty, afford an opportunity forconcluding a satisfactory agreement which may not recur.      8606   [13231]Copy  No.  43
     3.  I therefore would urge most strongly that my colleagues should reconsider their decision on the question of reference to the League of Nations, and should agree not to insist on the omission of such reference.  The proposed provision that the King of Egypt recognises the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government inrelation to  the  Canal ought to  suffice to ensure  that, when the time comes for-revising the treaty terms relating to the position and number of troops requiredto defend the Canal,  this recognition would form the basis  on which the Council,if appealed to, would deal with the question.   I therefore hope that my colleagues will agree that  instructions should  be sent to Sir Miles Lampson which, whileproviding  for  the points  mentioned  in  (ii)  and (iii), will  not direct him to insist  on the omission of a provision  for  reference  to the  Council of theLeague  (point  (i)).   As  regards  points (ii)  and  (iii),  it  may  be  useful toexplain that paragraph 4 of the annexed draft telegram is designed to meet theopinion expressed by some of my colleagues that the words &quot; It is understood thatthe position of  His  Britannic Majesty  in relation to the Suez Canal and thecontinued  maintenance and protection  in  all  circumstances  of  the  essentialcommunications of His  Britannic Majesty shall be provided for in any revisionof the present treaty,&quot; which were deleted from the  duration article (article 16)in accordance with the recommendation of the  Cabinet Committee, should bereplaced by the  insertion  &quot; prominently  elsewhere in  the treaty, for example, inthe Preamble &quot;  of a declaration on similar lines in which  Egypt  admitted apermanent  British claim in relation  to  the Canal.   The suggestion has been carefully considered, and  it is thought that this declaration can best be put as aPreamble to article 9 of the treaty-that  is to say, the article which provides forthe stationing of British forces in Egypt, &amp;c.  No complete draft of article 9 yetexists, and  it cannot be completed until the negotiations of the  military mattershave been finished, but the text which is set out in paragraph 4 of the  annex maybe useful as an illustration of the character of the article which is  contemplated.     4.  In  the text just referred to, Egypt&apos;s recognition of a permanent Britishclaim  in respect of  the  Canal  is contained in  the  words printed in italics^1)     In that text I  have retained the wrord &quot; authorises.&quot;   I think that this wordor  &apos;&apos; agrees to &apos;&apos;  or some similar  word is inevitable in the  provision  whichexpresses Egyptian agreement to the maintenance of troops  in Egyptian territory.At the meeting of the Cabinet on the 11th May this was criticised on the groundthat the King of Egypt might withdraw that authority  in twenty years.   This,however, is not  possible under the texts which are now proposed, because underarticle  16  the whole of the treaty  goes  on, including the provisions  about theposition of  the troops, until it is replaced by a new treaty negotiated by commonagreement.   Twenty years is not put in as the time limit of the operation of these clauses, but as the time when either party  has the right to approach the other witha request for revision.  In my opinion, there are disadvantages in concluding atreaty under which the provisions with regard to numbers  and stations of troopscame to an end in twenty years, unless there is a third party who can decide whatis to replace them  if the contracting parties cannot agree.  I consider that thisis so, even though  there are also declarations by Egypt recognising a permanentBritish right to protect the Canal, because at the end of twenty years Egypt coulddispute the numbers and places in which our troops were situated for this purpose and appeal  to the Council  of the  League of Nations, &amp;c.     5.   I  think it is  desirable to  call  attention to  paragraph 5 of  the draft telegram.  We are still at an early stage, namely, informal negotiations,  and.itis only at the conclusion of the formal  negotiations that  the final texts  of thetreaty can be drawn  up.   My colleagues will, I feel sure, agree with me that it is undesirable to  crystallise  into  formula?,  at  too early a stage  and it will  addunnecessarily to the difficulties of negotiation if decisions as to drafting and exactforms of words are  taken now as  opposed  to decisions upon  principles which    (!) The  possibility  of putting this Egyptian declaration into the Preamble  of the wholetreaty has been considered.  It has been thought inadvisable to attempt to do so because thiswill necessitate drafting this Preamble in the form of recitals of declarations on one side and onthe other and this will make it difficult to avoid references to the reserved points in their liquidation-tion  and other contentious points which will raise objections on the Egyptian side.  It meansscrapping the Preamble agreed in 1930.  This text appears reasonably satisfactory in itself andit  is therefore perhaps a pity to change it.  The legal effect of this declaration in the preamble to the whole treaty or as a Preamble to article 9 would be exactly the same, but the Egyptiansbeing very much influenced by superficial appearances would probably make more difficulty about it in one place than in the other.
have to be safeguarded or provided for.  In the light of what is stated above inparagraph 2 of this paper, I trust that my colleagues will be able to agree that instructions should be sent to Sir Miles Lampson in the sense of the draft telegramannexed to this paper.  I would urge, too, that they should so decide at our next meeting.  Both Sir Miles Lampson and Nahas Pasha,  the new Prime Minister ofEgypt and  leader  of the  Egyptian  delegation, have within  the  last  weekemphasised, not for the first time, the importance of avoiding any further delay in resuming and pursuing the discussions, which have already been spun out overa long period.                                                                    A.  E.    Foreign Office, May  16, 1936.                                ENCLOSURE.    YOUR telegram No. 371 and my telegram No. 224.  You should reopen thediscussions with Nahas Pasha on the following basis : Cairo.    1.   You may inform  Nahas Pasha that, provided  the Egyptian delegationagree to the retention of British troops in Alexandria or its vicinity and that asatisfactory  solution is reached with regard to the time limit for their presence in that locality, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to withdraw their troopsentirely from Cairo  and  its vicinity, as soon  as alternative  accommodation is ready.A lexandria.    2.   The retention of  British troops in or near Alexandria, in addition tothose stationed in the Canal, is essential.  As  regards a time limit, it has not sofar been possible to find a substitute for the formula that the British  troops should remain  in  Alexandria  or  its  vicinity  until  such  time  as  the  egyptian army, to the satisfaction  of both parties,  is  fit  to  take over.  But in putting forward the requirements of His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in this matter you shouldmake the most of the concession entailed by the evacuation of the  whole city ofCairo, pointing out that it has been agreed  to without condition as to the postingof troops at Helouan (or some equally central and  more technically suitable point)and that this  from the point of view of military exigencies is done reluctantly,but is made, on political grounds, as a sincere  effort  to meet Egyptian sentiment.     You could also state  that there have been serious  misgivings  here over theprovision giving power to the Council of the League of Nations (when the time comes for a  new treaty to be concluded in place of the  present one) to  settle theterms of the new treaty relating to the position  and number of  troops requiredto defend the Canal  in the absence of an agreement  between the ContractingParties.  In saying this you may  refer to the rather  different  position of theLeague of Nations to-day than in 1930, but without indicating more than you can help any loss of confidence in the League on  the part of His Majesty&apos;s government or any expectation  that the provisions of the Covenant will be changed.   you could explain that  in spite of their misgivings,  His Majesty&apos;s  Government, in deference to Egyptian opinion, have, nevertheless, decided to retain the  provision in question.   If you  make these points, it seems that  Nahas Pasha should be persuaded to agree to the retention of British troops in Alexandria and to theinclusion, after all,  of the  phrase &quot; to their  mutual satisfaction&quot; as  governing the test of the Egyptian army&apos;s fitness to replace British troops in  thatcity.  Surelythe concession over Cairo and the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government overreference to the League of Nations should give his Excellency a make-Aveight withwhich  to meet possible objections  on  the  part of his  colleagues and of publicopinion ?Duration of Treaty.     3.  The Cabinet are prepared to agree to  a duration article on  the following lines :  &quot; At any time after the expiration  of  a period of twenty years from thecoming into force of the treaty, the High Contracting Parties will,  at the request
of either  of them, enter into negotiations, with a view to  such revision of its terms by  agreement between them as may be appropriate in the circumstances as they then exist.  In the case of the High Contracting Parties being unableto agree upon the terms of the revised treaty, the difference will be submitted tothe Council of  the  League  of Nations  for  decision, which will be taken by unanimous resolution excluding  the  votes of the representatives of the UnitedKingdom and of Egypt &quot;  (alternative for last words :  &quot; decision in  accordancewith the provisions of the  Covenant of the League of Nations as in force at thetime of the signature of the present treaty &quot;).    4.  It is necessary  to include in the article corresponding to Article D of the1930 draft or in some other suitable position earlier in the treaty provisions underwhich Egypt accords a recognition of permanent British rights and interests inrelation to the Suez Canal.  This is particularly necessary if the Council of theLeague is to decide  in  the event of failure to agree  on the  terms of  the revisedtreaty relating to the positions  and numbers of troops required to  defend the canal, because this recognition would then form a basis upon which the Councilmust  decide the dispute.  Article 9 might run generally on the following lines:&quot; His   Majesty  the   King   of   Egypt   recognises   that  the  Suez   canal and   the  adjacent   territories,   while   being   an  integral  part   of  Egypt,form    an  essential   artery   of   all  forms   of   communication  between different  parts  of   the  British  Empire,   the  permanent  maintenance  and protection of which is in  the  common interest  of  both High ContractingParties, and  accordingly  authorises His  Britannic  Majesty to maintain on egyptian territory in  the vicinity  of  the  Canal such forces as His BritannicMajesty considers necessary to  ensure the  protection of this artery of communica-tion.   The  presence of these forces shall not constitute  in any  manner an occupation and will  in no way  prejudice the sovereign rights of Egypt.  In  viewof the position of His Britannic Majesty in relation  to the Canal, His majesty the King of Egypt recognises that His Britannic  Majesty may, through the commanders of his forces, take all steps necessary for the maintenance  of thesecurity of and of the freedom of navigation in the said Canal.    The egyptian authorities will co-operate in all measures  for the purpose aforesaid.  The detailed arrangements for the carrying into effect of this article are contained in the annexhereto &quot; (see my despatches Nos.  341  of the 15th April and 381 of the  27th Aprilfor the reasons for and  an explanation of  these provisions).    5.  In sending the  texts in paragraphs 3 and 4 there is no intention to tie youdown to these exact w^ords.   Other words  may be used provided they cover therequirements  equally well, particularly the points explained in my  despatchesNos. 341 and 381 as regards the latter text.
