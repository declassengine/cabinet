CP. 128(36)                            CABINET.                    Extension of Maternal Health Service in Bootland.                    kemprandvua &quot;fey ihe Secretary of State for Scotland.     following the introduction of a Bill to improve the standard ofdomiciliary midwifery in England and Wales,  I desire the authority of  mycolleagues to prepare and circulate to the Home Affairs Committee a Billfor the extension of maternal healtfo services in Scotland.     The main proposals which it is desired to incorporate in the Bill arein conformity with the conclusions drawn from a special investigation  intothe oausos of maternal morbidity and mortality in Scotland and approvedby the clinical sub-committee of the Scientific Advisory Committee to  theDepartment of Health, augmented by a number of distinguished obstetricians.They are accordingly based on authoritative medical opinion, both official and independent,  and are as follows:-   (i)  Every local authority must sequre that there is available for  itsarea sufficient midwives to aot as maternity nurses in association withmedical practitioners or, where a woman so desires, as midwives.   Por thispurpose the local authority might Eiake arrangements with voluntary associa-tions or itself employ midwives.   To maintain adequate standards efficientsupervision of the work of midwives should be instituted,  and they shouldbe required to attend refresher courses where these are reasonably available  (ii)  Every local authority must make such other arrangement a as theDepartment think necessary to secure proper attention for expectant and nursing mothers and women in childbirth. (iii)  Certain general provisions (e.g.,  the prohibition of unqualifiedpersons acting as paid maternity nurses) already agreed to in connectionwith the English Bill would be included.     These proposals differ in some respects from those incorporated in theEnglish Bill, but the Scottish problem is in many ways different from  thatin England.    The maternal mortality rate is -higher in Scotland.   nidwivesattend to  a much smaller proportion of cases of childbirth than in England. -25 per cent, as against 60 per cent. - and doctors attend to a correspond-Ingly higher proportion.   The practical impossibility of applying arrange-mentB -e.g,, ante^natal and postnatal clinics - suited to an industrial orurban area,  to districts such as the Highlands and Islands,  and the varyingconditions in regard to maternity practice even as between different urban areas make it essential to frame proposals sufficiently broad and elastioto ensure  the development by local authorities of services suited to thecircumstances of their areas.   The aim is to make available to every  womanwho applies for it appropriate medical and nursing care before, during,and after  confinement.     Under the proposed Bill local authorities would be involved in materialadditional expenditure, and towards this it  is proposed that in the firstinstance the Department of Health should make a grant.   Details of thegrant are  under discussion between the Department and the Treasury.    It isestimated  that when the arrangements are in full operation the total annualcharge on  the Exchequer will not exceed  60,000.   After a sufficient  lapse of time the Exchequer contribution would be included in the block grantunder the  Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1929.                                  (Id.)    G. P.
