April 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.1225-B.(Also Paper No. CCS. 454.)               COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.MILITARY ASPECTS  OF  AN ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATY.                 Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.     1.  ARISING out of consideration by the Cabinet of the position reached inthe negotiations for an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, we have been asked to examine and report  on the  counter-proposals made  by Nahas Pasha, and contained  inForeign Office telegram No. 233 dated the 20th March, 1936, printed as an annex to this Report.     2.  We have again considered this problem and are  still of opinion that the priority of the stages of discussion,  &quot;A,&quot; &quot; B &quot; and finally &quot; 0,&quot; as set  forth in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram No. 125 of the 8th February, 1936, are the propermeasures for consideration in connection with the military aspects of an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.     3.  If, however, on political grounds for the purposes of securing a Treaty,it is considered necessary to abandon the proposals to locate a British garrison at Helouan, we consider it  of fundamental importance that there should  be  inEgypt strong  military forces in both the Suez Canal zone  and the  Alexandriaarea, and that the strength of these forces should be that  considered necessary byHis  Majesty&apos;s  Government to enable  them to carry out their role.  On military grounds we cannot contemplate the acceptance of any proposal limiting the british forces to the Suez Canal zone only as suggested by Nahas Pasha.  The abandon-ment of the Cairo area would necessitate a. larger garrison at Alexandria.    4.  We wish to point out that the evacuation of the British garrison  fromthe Cairo area involves grave disadvantages, namely :       (a)  The steadying effect of the presence of British troops in  the neighbour-          hood of Cairo will be lost.  In the years of comparative quiet that we          have, had  in Egypt lately  we  are  very  apt  to forget  this  very          important fact.    (b) In the event of the  Egyptian Government failing to fulfil her responsi-          bilities for the maintenance of internal order and protection of foreign          interests and it becomes necessary in the last resort to despatch British          troops to Cairo, we shall be faced with a very difficult military propo-          sition.  It might even be necessary to reoccupy Cairo in the face of a          disaffected Egyptian Army trained and equipped by us to a higher          standard of efficiency than at present.    (c) In the event of trouble  at Alexandria necessitating reinforcements  from          the Canal Zone, such reinforcement will be rendered uncertain owing          to the vulnerability of the  communications  across  the  Nile Delta,          however  much improved,  to  sabotage,  whereas the road  from Cairo          running across the Desert would permit of reinforcement  in 24 hours..      [13008]
    (d) The advantages of the  &apos;&apos; pooling system &apos;&apos;  which we are now advocating          with the object of ensuring a close connection between the Egyptian          and British Armies, so that they can be regarded as one force to meet          external aggression,  would be lost.    5.  Increased numbers in the Canal  Zone, as appear to be offered by nahas pasha, have little bearing on any of the above matters.  We have already recom-mended (C.I.D. Paper No. 1212-B, paragraph 39) that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould retain the  right to reinforce  Egypt in emergency and that the  treaty should contain provision for increasing the  strength of the peace time garrisonif events indicate  that step to  be necessary.  Futher, we advised that          &quot; The number of troops to be stationed in Egypt in normal times to be    a matter of discussion between  the  two countries when the existing inter-    national situation has become stable.&quot;    6.  &quot; Air facilities in the  Western Desert&quot; constitute only a part of thosefacilities which we have  already recommended as being necessary (C.I.D. PaperNo. 1212-B, paragraph 39).  Similarly we have always contemplated that thereshould be &quot; general compliance with the British  Military Mission&apos;s advice &quot;(C.I.D. Paper No. 1212-B, paragraph 20).                    (Signed)      ERNLE  CHATFIELD.                                  A. A. MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD.                                   E. L.

MY telegrams Nos. 230 and 231*    Whilst we can doubtless continue to  spin our talks out for some time still(which is what I propose to do), I estimate that following may turn out to be not far off the mark :-     (a) If we stick to it we may (and I myself hazard that we will) be able to get          something acceptable as regards  Alexandria or neighbourhood.  But          we should have to fight hard for it, and it is by no means certain.    (&amp;) As regards Cairo (Abbassia and Helmieh), I gauge the indications as being          that Egyptians  will definitely not agree, however hard we fight for it,          and that  if we  insist a break is  almost certain.  The same may well          prove to be the case over Elelouan.    2.  In order to  clear  our  minds betimes it would  be  helpful  to know HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s reaction to what Nahas Pasha has so far offered over and above 1930 provisions, e.g.,  (1) improved communications  (railway and road) to oursatisfaction;  (2) increased numbers in Canal Zone (also to our satisfaction, though he is  less explicit as regards the  amount of increase over 1930 figure; (3) airfacilities in western desert; (4) general compliance with British military mission&apos;advice.  It may be that these factors may influence the views of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  as regards instructions to which  I am at present working  (yourtelegram No. 4 [sic&apos;] ), and it would be helpful if I could know betimes if this is.so. To the lay mind they seem to have some value.    3.   I have a meeting with service advisers on Saturday and hope to be ableto telegraph their views.                               * Not reproduced.

Paper No. 1225-B.)Letter from the Foreign Office to the Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence.[No. J 2939 /G]Sir,                                         Foreign Office, April  15, 1936.    I  AM  directed by Mr.  Secretary  Eden  to  state that  he has  had underconsideration the report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, dated the 1st April, on certain points arising in connexionwith the military aspects of an Anglo-Egyptian treaty.  The report in question,which is numbered C.O.S. 454, is contained in  C.I.D. Paper 1225-B.    2.   Mr. Eden considers that  in the light of discussions held in Cairo betweenthe British  and Egyptian delegations subsequent to the date  of the Chiefs of staff  report, it  would be politically desirable for His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto abandon insistence on the location of a British garrison at Helouan in spite ofthe military disadvantages entailed by such a  move as set out by the Chiefs ofStaff in their report.    3.   In this connexion, I am to call attention to  the views of the GeneralOfficer  Commanding in Egypt and of the Air Officer Commanding, Middle East,as reported  in the telegram from His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner for  egypt and the Sudan, No.  28, Saving, of the 2nd April, a copy of which is attached.    4.   I .am to request that the  recommendation contained in this letter may bediscussed by the  Committee of Imperial  Defence at their next meeting.                                             I  am,  &amp;c.                                   (Signed)       RONALD CAMPBELL.                                ENCLOSURE.Telegram  from Sir M. Lampson  (Cairo), No.  28, Saving, dated April 2,  1936.    MY telegram No. 236*    Following  are notes  by  Air  Officer  Commanding  and  General OfficerCommanding  on  strategical  value  of  concessions  so  far  proposed  byNahas Pasha :  1.  Alexandria.    (a) Alexandria will always  be  of  the  utmost importance  to the BritishEmpire, second only in Egypt to the  Canal, as it is the natural harbour for ourfleet to use in the Eastern Mediterranean.    (b) A sudden landing is more likely in the neighbourhood of Alexandria thananywhere  else in Egypt.                               * Not reproduced.       [13068]
2    (c)  In the event of serious rioting in Egypt, foreigners are just as likely tobe attacked in  Alexandria as in Cairo, but intervention by another  european power would be far more likely to occur at Alexandria than in Cairo.  :-w (d)  In case of a hostile landing,  British reinforcements moving from  the canal Zone towards Alexandria would have to cross the Delta. Could be held upin a great many places either by enemy air bombing or by sabotage, and might takedays  to get there.    (e)  Deduction. It would be a great risk to agree to moving all British troops from the neighbourhood of Alexandria.2. Cairo.    (a)  Affords a better place for a mobile reserve than anywhere else in Egypt,but, provided communications are improved,  the difference in time of  movement between having a mobile reserve in Cairo or  having it in the Canal  Zone would only be a matter of hours.    (b)  With  the increased speed  of movement  due  to the development ofmechanisation,  it  seems  less necessary now to keep forces in Cairo to quellinternal unrest.  We don&apos;t want our army to act as a  police reserve  and to becalled upon frequently, but only to come in if rioting is developing to insurrection.    (c)  Provided we retain our headquarters in  Cairo and have a strong british mission  with the Egyptian army, we ought to be able to keep in touch with  theinternal  situation, and to know whether any  revolts  were  being  hatched inthe army.    (d)  Deduction. The real risk of removing British troops from Cairo is  thedifficulty of establishing a base and recovering control of  all means of  communica-tion with a really hostile Egyptian Government  in power.    But if an agreed treaty is considered of the greatest importance and negotiations are likely to break down over this question, such a risk would haveto be accepted.  An agreed treaty renders the probability of a really hostile Egyptmore remote.3. With regard to the R.A.F.    (a)  We must locate any army co-operation squadrons near the army.    (&amp;)  If we have a fighter  squadron primarily for the defence of Alexandria,it must  be stationed near Alexandria.  Amiriya would be suitable.    (c)  Although we don&apos;t want to move from Cairo,  bomber squadrons  could operate  almost as efficiently from the Canal Zone as from Heliopolis.    (d)  Provided  a suitable  site can be found,  there would be  no objection tomoving  the depot from Aboukir to the Canal Zone.    (e)  The R.A.F. must have freedom of flight  over the whole of Egypt, and begiven facilities  for the establishment of landing-grounds.    (/)  Deduction. Given (b) and (e),  if applicable, we can agree to R.A.F. basesbeing located in the Canal Zone.    4.  The concessions  already  given by Nahas go a considerable way to meet our essential requirements.    We still require :-         (a) British troops in the neighbourhood of Alexandria.         (b) Headquarters in Cairo.         (c) Freedom of manoeuvres for land forces during the training season.         (d) Definition of &quot;air facilities&quot; to meet our  requirements.    5.  If British troops move out of Cairo, who will find the Residency guards ?    NOTE. Although the time-limit for the occupation of the Canal Zone has  notbeen mentioned and may not be raised by the Egyptian delegation, they are certain to ask for a time-limit for the occupation of Alexandria.    The question to be decided is whether it is  worth wrecking the negotiationsfor the sake of  avoiding a time-limit at Alexandria.    Would a British guard on  the  Embassy be necessary  if the  treaty goesthrough ?

April  1936.secret copy  No*1228-B(Also Paper No. CCS. 458.)COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATY-INCLUSION OF  A  TIME LIMIT                  (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1225-B.)REPORT BY THE  CHIEFS OF  STAFF SUB-COMMITTEE.     1.  WE have had under consideration a letter from the  Foreign Office tothe Under-Secretary of State, War Office (No. J. 2615/2/16 of the 27th March,.1936 copy attached  as Appendix I) referring  to the question of the inclusionof a &quot; time limit&quot; on the lines of Article 14 of the  1930 Draft in an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.  As Sir Miles Lampson considers that a refusal by us to agree-to any  time limit or  reference to the League of Nations would prove a majordifficulty, the  Foreign Office have  put forward certain proposals, which, briefly,.are to  the  following effect :i      (a) If no provision for a time limit as was contemplated  in  Article  14*           of  the draft Treaty of 1930 is included in a Treaty,  the legal position.           will be  somewhat  uncertain.   It is, therefore,  suggested  that His           Majesty&apos;s Government should begin by attempting to secure agreement           upon an article in the  terms of Article 16t  of the 1933 draft.     (b) If the Egyptian  negotiators reject  an  article in the above terms  the&apos;           Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs would propose that an attempt.           should be made to secure an article on the lines of Article 111 of  the           Treaty of Alliance between  the United Kingdom and Iraq.     (c) If the Egyptian delegates refuse to accept an article in these terms and           stand on Article 14 of the 1930 draft treaty, the Secretary of  State           for Foreign Affairs considers that it would be preferable to agree to           the Egyptian demand  rather  than that treaty negotiations should           break down on this point.They have asked that if  the Army  Council agree, a  recommendation may be-made to the  Committee of Imperial Defence to the effect that the procedureoutlined in (a), (b) and (c) above should be adopted in principle;  as  a matter of convenience we have considered this matter at a meeting of the Chiefs of Staffin order that a co-ordinated view may be presented.Our Responsibility for the Maintenance of Imperial Communications in Egypt..    2.   In considering this proposal, the first point which we desire to stress isthat the main and overwhelming consideration in any Treaty is  the continuing.security in all circumstances of our maritime communications through the suez canal and of our air communications in Egypt.  All other military considerations.are contributory to this.   The security of  the  communications of the BritishEmpire in  Egypt was the first of the four reserved points when, in 1922, Egyptwas declared by His Majesty&apos;s Government to be an independent Sovereign State,and in recent  years this responsibility has been  affirmed and reaffirmed both  bythe Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet.* Appendix II.f Appendix III.$ Appendix IV.[13060]B
2     3.  The importance attached by His Majesty&apos;s Government to this responsi- bility is illustrated by the fact that when the Defence of the Suez Canal zone was under consideration at the 267th Meeting  of the Committee of Imperial Defence oh the 18th December, 1934, it  was  agreed  on our  recommendation that  the Government of the day should declare  a state of emergency in the Canal zone at mMj tifme widen the situation might appear to  warrant such action.   It is well understood that such action would be, mainly, action  by Naval Forces,  as it is only by forcible Naval Action that certain acts against the security and freedom of tbe Canal can be prevented.     4.  Again, in dealing with a recommendation contained in our  report on the  military aspects of an  Anglo-Egyptian Treaty,  viz. : (C.I.D. Paper No. 1212^B)-         &quot;That His Majesty&apos;s  Government must remain exclusively responsible     for the security  of  the  Suez  Canal;  no  right to participate  in this     responsibility should be conceded to the Egyptian Government.&quot; the  Prime  Minister  in a report to the Cabinet, stated  that the Committee of Imperial Defence had  recommended that  &quot;this point  should not be specifically raised in the negotiations for a Treaty,  but our responsibility  for the security of the Suez Canal should  be assumed&quot; (CP. 25 (36)).  When  this report was considered  on  the 10th February, 1936,  the  Cabinet agreed  that  the  above recommendation  &apos;&apos; should  not  be interpreted as  necessarily   prohibiting the granting of permission to the Egyptian Government to station  a small number of troops (e.g.-, a battalion or a few companies) within the  Canal Zone as  an earnest of the  sincerity of our desire  for co-operation with Egypt as an ally, but  that this would  only  be permitted on the distinct  understanding that  no abrogation  or weakening was involved  of  our responsibility for the security of the Suez Canal.&quot;     5.  Up  to date,  then,  the responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s  Government forthe protection  of the Suez Canal  has  always been assumed  as a fundamental point and in order to  secure the  conditions essential  to our fulfilment  of this responsibility, negotiations have, in the main, centred on the strength and location of the British Forces in Egypt whose main purpose, indeed, is the protection ofour Imperial communications.    6.  We consider  that the role of the British Forces in respect of the Canalis so vital that it is not possible  to permit this role to be  transferred  at anytime to any other country,  bearing in  mind that Egypt will never have naval forces  able  to relieve our Navy from this  responsibility.  Unless, therefore, wemaintain the security of the Suez Canal in our own hands it will not be possibleto safeguard the communications of the  British Empire, the  Dominions andIndia.   Our Imperial Strategy is based on this foundation.  Although politicalnecessities may override military  considerations in lesser matters we considerthat  in this respect a vital strategic question is at  stake.                                CONCLUSIONS.    7.  It appears to us that the proposals of the Foreign Office, as  set forth in paragraph 1, risk  eventually placing the above vital  responsibility of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in jeopardy.  Furthermore, we believe that  the same was true of the  1930 draft Treaty.  Had we signed that draft Treaty, our right toprotect the Suez Canal and the air communications of the Empire  would sooner or later have been endangered, since it provided for a time limit at the expiration of which the matter might have been referred to the League of Nations and thedecision of  the  League might have  gone against us.  We consider it  essentialto our imperial  security that this mistake shall not be repeated.    8.  In these circumstances, on military grounds, and from the point of viewof safeguarding our Empire Communications, we cannot subscribe  to any of theproposals  put forward by  the Secretary of  State  for  Foreign Affairs  which provide for  the  inclusion in  the draft of  an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty  of an unqualified &quot; time limit &quot; with possible reference on its expiration to the League
of Nations.  We cannot recommend the conclusion of any Treaty which may havethe effect, at some future date, of depriving us of the right to safeguard the suez canal.  We recommend, on the  contrary, that as a  first step His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should Dress for  the inclusion early in the Treaty of an articlerecognising our antecedent  and permanent right to protect the Suez Canal, andthat  the position of His  Majesty&apos;s Government in this  respect should beestablished.  When this fundamental point has been provided and the position isclearly understood, there  would not be the same objection  to the  imposition of atime limit  as  regards other Military aspects of the Treaty, with, perhaps, a reference to the League of Nations in case of disagreement.

APPENDIX  I.          Copy of a Letter from the Foreign Office to the War Office.No. J. 2615/2/16.Sir,                                         Foreign Office, March 27, 1936.     IN paragraph 39 (i) (&amp;) of their report of the 5th February on the military aspects  of an Anglo-Egyptian  treaty  (C.I.D. Paper No.  1212-B,  and  PaperNo.  CCS. 430),  the Chiefs of Staff state that the rule of the British forces inEgypt is  immutable and cannot logically be subject  to any time limit or be amatter for submission to the League of Nations, as was  envisaged in the 1930draft treaty.  Commenting upon this, the Chairman of the Committee of ImperialDefence, in paragraph 5 of his memorandum of the 7th February (CP. 25 (36)),pointed out the difficulty of reconciling this condition with an eventual Egyptianmembership of the League of Nations,  which would enable Egypt to bring thematter before the League under Article 19  of the Covenant; that in the draft treaty of 1930 an attempt was made to overcome the difficulty by the inclusion ofa time limit of twenty years, within which the question would not be raised; butthat a time limit was a dubious and temporary safeguard, which was open to laterchallenge by Egypt under Article 19 of the&apos; Covenant of the League.  (He pointedout,  however, that recommendations of the League under Article 19 do not become effective without the assent of  both  parties to the treaty.)  It was therefore recommended (paragraph 6) that the British  negotiators  should  not  themselvespropose a time limit for the treaty, and  that if it were  proposed on the Egyptianside  they should oppose it.  In paragraph 10  of his  telegram No. 94, Secret, ofthe 20th February  to His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner  for Egypt,  containinginstructions for the conduct of the preliminary conversations with the egyptian delegation  on the military aspects of an Anglo-Egyptian treaty, Mr. SecretaryEden informed Sir Miles Lampson that  paragraphs 5  and 6  of the Committee ofImperial Defence memorandum should be interpreted, as far as concerns the pointregarding  the League of Nations,  as meaning that  it was undesirable  in  an eventual treaty  specifically to  mention reference  of a  dispute between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Egyptian  Government  to the League of nations in connection with the duration or revision of a treaty.     2.  In his telegram No.  169 of the 25th February,  Sir  Miles Lampson,referring to this  question, stated his conviction that a refusal to agree to anytime limit or reference to the League of Nations would prove a major difficulty,and he pointed out that during negotiations in 1930 the Egyptian delegation were only induced with the utmost difficulty to agree that the maintenance of Britishtroops in the Canal Zone should remain unquestioned for twenty years.     3.  In his reply (Telegram No. 122 of the 29th February), the Secretary ofState explained that the issue was one between (a) a treaty  which would not belimited in point of time, but would go  on indefinitely  until both parties agreedthat it should be changed, and (b) one under which after a fixed minimum period the parties would negotiate  with a view to  agreeing  whether the treaty shouldbe continued or not and a dispute on the point would be referred to the Councilof the League of Nations.  In the same telegram Mr.  Eden reminded Sir miles lampson that there would be no objection to the inclusion  in the treaty  of  anarticle in the terms of Article 13 of the 1930  draft, under which any differenceon the subject of the application or interpretation of the provisions in the  treaty which the high contracting parties were unable to settle  by direct negotiations should be  dealt with  in accordance with the provisions of the  Covenant of theLeague of  Nations.  But, of course, if the duration article  was  in form (a) theLeague  of Nations could  at most only make recommendations  as regards thecontinuance or revision of the treaty;  whereas if  it was in form (b) the council could give  a binding decision in a resolution which would not require the votes of Egypt or the United Kingdom to render it valid.   Mr. Eden  requested thatif  Sir Miles Lampson still considered that Egyptian sentiment demanded a time limit after which  the question of the duration and revision of the treaty should ifnecessary be referred to the League, he  should report accordingly, in  order that
if necessary the matter might be reconsidered by His Majesty&apos;s Government witha view to deciding between  the disadvantage of agreeing to the specific mention of a time limit and that of failure to secure a treaty.  And oh  the 14th March, iiihis telegram No.  218, His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner replied that he fearedthere was no hope of Egypt agreeing to any treaty which did not contain some kind of  time limit  or  limitative provision, coupled probably  (though on  this he was not equally certain) with a provision for reference in the last resort to theLeague of Nations.  He  considered  it was most improbable  that  the egyptian delegation would accept so considerable a departure from what was agreed to in1930.  It should  further  be observed that the draft treaty of  1928;  drawn upby  Sir Austen Chamberlain and Sarwat Pasha, gave  the League of  nations the power  to decide where  the British forces in Egypt should be located  afterten years (Article 7) and that it  is  most unusual for treaties of alliance  to beregarded as of perpetual  duration.     4.  In view of the opinions expressed by Sir Miles Lampson, it  cannot, inthe  opinion  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  be  anticipated that  the  Egyptiannegotiators will agree to the omission from  a treaty of an  article on the lines ofArticle 14 of the draft treaty of 1930.  This article, it will be remembered, laiddown that at any time after the expiration of a period of  twenty years the highcontracting parties would, at the request of either of them, enter into negotiationswith a view to such revision  by agreement between them of the  terms of the treaty as might be appropriate in  the circumstances as  they then existed  : that in caseof disagreement  the difference would be submitted to the League of Nations:and that negotiations for revision could be entered  into with the consent of both parties  at any time after  ten  years.  The Committee  of  Imperial  Defencerecommended  in  their  memorandum that it would be desirable  to  avoid theinclusion of any  provision referring to the duration of the treaty at all.   but mr. Eden is advised that the legal  position in the  event of this  solution being adopted  will be sbniewhat uncertain.   Apart from possible  termination  underArticle 19 of the Covenant, it would be open to Egypt to argue that she couldterminate unilaterally at  any time on giving reasonable notice, unless  the treatystated that it was to remain in force until revised by common consent or that itwas perpetual (see  Oppenheim,  International  Law, Volume  1,  4th  Edition,page 746).  In the  circumstances it  seems to  Mr.  Eden to be  a matter forconsideration whether it would be in the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto attempt this solution.  If  the Army Council agree, Mr. Eden would recommendthat His Majesty&apos;s  Government should begin by attempting to secure  agreement upon an article in the terms of Article 16 of the  1933 draft, under  which thetreaty would continue indefinitely in force until both parties agree  on  what is totake its place.  In such an article it would be laid down that at airy  time  afterthe expiration  of, say, twenty years, the parties would negotiate with a view toits revision.  But the mention of this period would only have the effect  that therewould be a moral right when this period had expired to call for negotiations andfor an endeavour to  reach agreement: unless agreement were  reached  the treaty would continue in  its  original form.   The article would also state that thecontinued  maintenance and protection  in all  circumstances of  the essentialcommunications of His Britannic Majesty should be provided for in any revisionagreed upon.  If the Egyptian negotiators should reject an article in these terms,then Mr. Eden  would propose that an attempt should be made to secure an articleon the lines of  Article 11 of the Treaty of Alliance of 1930 between the UnitedKingdom and Iraq.   Under this  article the treaty  is to remain in force for aperiod of twenty-five years, and  at any time after twenty years from the date ofthe coming into force of the  treaty the high contracting parties shall, at therequest of either of them, conclude a new treaty  which  shall  provide for thecontinued  maintenance and protection  in all  circumstances of  the essentialcommunications of His Britannic Majesty.  In case of disagreement &quot; in  thismatter &quot; the difference is to be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations.     5.  It seems possible that Egyptian desiderata would be  satisfied  by the mention of a time limit for  the treaty and by the provision for reference to theLeague of Nations  of a  difference on the question whether  the new treaty tobe concluded provides  for  the  continued maintenance and  protection  of theessential communication of  His Britannic Majesty, while the requirement thatthe  treaty should  safeguard essential  British  communications   might afford
adequate protection to the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government.  The provision is, in any case, an improvement from the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment on the terms of the article agreed  to (Article 14) in the negotiations with egypt  of 1930.    6.   It is nevertheless most probable that the Egyptian delegation will refuseto accept an article even in these terms and will stand upon Article 14 of the1930 draft.  In that case Mr. Eden  considers that it would be preferable toagree to the Egyptian demand rather than that treaty negotiations should breakdown on this point.    7.   I am, therefore, to suggest for consideration that if the Army  Councilagree with the  foregoing a recommendation should be made  by them  to  theCommittee of Imperial  Defence to the effect that the procedure proposed inparagraphs 4, 5, and 6 above  should be  adopted  in principle.  I am  to ask thathe may be furnished with the views of the Army Council on this suggestion attheir early convenience.    8.   Similar letters are being sent to the Admiralty and Air Ministry.                                             I am, &amp;c.                                    (Signed)       RONALD  CAMPBELL.APPENDIX II.             Article 14 of the  1930 Draft Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.    AT any time after the expiration of a period of twenty years from the cominginto force of the Treaty, the High Contracting Parties  will,  at the request of either of them, enter into negotiations with a view to such revision by agreementbetween them of its terms as may be appropriate  in the  circumstances as they then exist.  In case of disagreement the difference will be submitted to the Leagueof Nations.    Nevertheless, at any time after the expiration of a period  of ten years fromthe coming into force of the Treaty, negotiations  may  be entered into with theconsent of  both the  High Contracting Parties with a  view to such revision asaforesaid.APPENDIX  III.            Article 16 of the 1933 Draft  Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.
