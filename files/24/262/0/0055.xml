Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    SINCE the advent to power of Herr Hitler, and since the  rearmament ofGermany began to assume the rate and proportions with which it is now beingcarried on,  His Majesty&apos;s  Government have been  mainly preoccupied  by  thecontinental  ambitions of that country,  the deferred threat implied by these toBritish interests and British territory,  and the means by which  this threat  canbe averted or met.   In parallel they have been preoccupied by the aggressivenature of Japanese policy and the specific threats implicit therein to the british position in the eastern hemisphere.  To these preoccupations the Italian conquestof Abyssinia has added a new and unexpected problem which may in few wordsbe described as follows.    The safety of British communications passing through the Suez Canal,  therelative stability of international relations in  the Mediterranean and  Red  Seabasins,  the  internal security of British possessions and protectorates  in those areas,  the  paramountcy of  Britain  in Egypt,  and the  influence which HisMajesty&apos;s Government have been able to exercise over foreign States in  the near and Middle East  have hitherto been largely assured by the unchallenged and,as it was thought, unchallengeable efficacy and prestige of British sea power inthe Mediterranean.    Recent events have, rightly or wrongly, placed in doubt the capacity of GreatBritain to maintain her predominant position in the Mediterranean, and, evensupposing the capacity to exist, her determination to  do so.  Ground has,  in short, been given in many  quarters for the belief that, for one reason or another,we are unable  to meet  the Italian challenge, and, as a  consequence, profoundmisgivings and hesitations have been manifested in Greece, Turkey,  Yugoslavia,Egypt, Arabia  and Palestine.  (These apprehensions are, of course, widespreadin other and even more important countries which are not germane to the purposeof this paper.)   This unsettlement of opinion will in any case manifest itself inIraq, Persia and even further afield unless something is done to arrest its progress.I do not propose in this paper to elaborate this theme, the grave import of whichmust indeed be obvious to everyone having any acquaintance with the Middle Eastand the Moslem world.  I would only allude to the  question of our  oil supplies and to the importance  to us of Moslem  opinion  in India to show that the stressI have laid on this relatively local aspect of the question is not  exaggerated.    The points  I wish to  emphasise are  four.  The first is this : that, thoughItaly would  certainly prove to be a much  less formidable antagonist than germany or Japan, the area within which we are exposed to her political  or  militaryhostility is one in which British interests are not only very important,  but veryvulnerable, and that the danger from Italy might become acute with very littlenotice  and at any moment particularly  after the lapse of  time necessary  forthe consolidation of Italy&apos;s present gains.    The second point  is  that a deterioration  of  the  British position in  theMediterranean and  Red Sea basins must be anticipated unless  we do something      8660   [133451                                                 :b
to re-establish our prestige and do it soon and with some emphasis.   Merely tohurry on with  our rearmament programme or advertise  the uses to which  ourarmaments might be put when they are ready is not enough. Nor will talk aboutthe League of Nations  or projects for its reform suffice.     The third point concerns the situation which may arise on the withdrawalof sanctions.  It may be found that special measures are necessary in order thatour prestige and power in the Mediterranean may be restored,  and perhaps alsoin order that Italy may be deterred from further &quot;expansion&quot;  to our detriment.What these measures might  be, and the circumstances in which they might beapplied, are the subjects of the present paper.     Fourthly, in submitting  the annexed paper to my colleagues, I do not wishto imply that an ultimate friendly agreement with Italy  is impossible.  On thecontrary, I  do  not propose  that we  should &apos;reject Mussolini&apos;s recent offers of goodwill and collaboration;  we ought,  indeed,  to put them to the test in  due course, just as we are attempting to put  to the test the similar  assurances whichwe are  continually receiving from Herr  Hitler.  Nor do I wish, on the otherhand, to exaggerate in any way Italy&apos;s potential capacity for mischief.  It maywell be  that her financial and economic troubles will ensure her good behaviourfor  some  time to  come;  and though  her organisational powers  have beentriumphantly demonstrated  in Abyssinia, her  combative powers particularlyin the face of any enemy provided with modern equipment have  not yet beenreally tested.  But in spite of all this, the situation is such that it is only prudentthat we should consider insuring against possible risks. In  the case of Germanywe have effected this insurance by our recent agreement of the  19th March with france  and  Belgium.  I now suggest that some similar form of insurance mayhave become advisable in respect of Italy.     It will be seen that the  proposals in the accompanying paper fall into two categories :  those  which have to  be taken immediately  on the withdrawal  of sanctions, and those which will have to wait on events and developments whichmay be expected to occur when we enter the new phase when sanctions have been withdrawn.   Although no immediate decision may be necessary, or possible withregard to the second category, it would be desirable, none the less, for the Cabinetto have  the views of the Chiefs of Staffs forthwith^qn the strategical aspect ofthe Questions involved.                                                                    A. E.     June  11, 1936.                     j                          - )                               MEMORANDUM.    AMONG the problems arising out of the Italian conquest of Abyssinia arethe following :     (1)  If sanctions are to be removed at the next meeting of the.Council, those          countries in the Balkans and  Eastern Mediterranean who are at          present  in  a  state of  disquiet at the prospect of possible  Italian          aggression in  their direction will be still further alarmed when, with          the disappearance of sanctions,, they automatically are deprived of the          guarantee of the. other League Members, and  more particularly of          Great Britain and Trance, which  they enjoy under paragraph 3 of          Article 16 of the Covenant.    (2)  Again,  if sanctions are removed; there is the question whether, pending          thorough discussions  of League reform, any steps are  possible in the          Mediterranean with a view to reinforcing the efficacy &quot;and restoring          the prestige of the League.    (3)  Lastly,  whether sanctions are removed&apos;or not, there  is the underlying,          enduring,  and, all-important  question of what,  should be done at a          subsequent stage to restore the impaired  prestige of  His Majesty&apos;s          Government  in   the  Mediterranean,   especially  the   Eastern          Mediterranean, and to provide such additional  security  for Imperial          communications through the Mediterranean with Egypt, Palestine and          the   Far  East,  as  - Mrrssolini&apos;s  victory  in  Abyssinia   renders          indispensable  on any  long view.
     2.   These three problems stand as they have been stated in inverse order of magnitude.  But while problem No. (1) will call for immediate treatment as soon as sanctions are removed by the League, the solutions of problems Nos. (2) and (3) must wait upon events and can at this stage only be suggested in broad outline. Actual decisions will depend upon the development of the general.situation.     3. .  It will be useful, however, forthwith to examine one particular proposal which has been put forward more or  less as  a  general panacea,  namely, the proposal for a Mediterranean Pact.  This proposal is, especially popular at the present moment among the lesser Mediterranean Powers, and although it has not taken any concrete  shape a good deal  more is likely to be heard&apos;-of it in the immediate future.  It is by no means a new conception, for the idea  of an agree- ment between the Mediterranean Powers can be traced, back at least as far as 1907, when declarations were exchanged between the  United Kingdom, France and Italy affirming  the intention of  the three  Powers &quot;individually  to maintain the  territorial  status quo,  but  not containing  any  kind  of guarantee.   It re-emerges in 1927 and is generally referred to thereafter as a &quot; Mediterranean Locarno.&quot;  A great  variety of pacts came wider discussion from time to time in connexion with discussions of disarmament and naval  limitation, but these were directed, and directed primarily by the French Government, towards two objects : in  general, -towards an  extension of the  European  security  system,  and,  in particular, towards a solution of the problems created by Franco-Italian rivalry.&apos;   -  4.  We did not  encourage the idea because (a) we  did not wish to undertake further commitments beyond Locarno and the Covenant; (&amp;) it was difficult to see how the  guarantee could be limited to defence against naval attack.  In practice the guarantee would have had to operate in the event of a 4:oid war  between any of the parties; thus, our guarantee would have been,  invoked in  the case  of Yugoslavia  invading  Greece,  or Italy  invading Yugoslavia,  or Yugoslavia invading Albania.  In practice, in none of these cases  could the British  Govern- ment have pledged themselves  to go  to war; (r) it would have been difficult to exclude Egypt, Russia, and Roumania from participation in the Pact, but their inclusion would ,in each case have raised the most difficult problems; (d) it was feared that any Mediterranean Pact might well involve provisions  for limiting the naval forces of the various signatories in the Mediterranean, thereby limiting the freedom of action of  the British Government in increasing or reducing the size of the Mediterranean Fleet according to requirements.     5.  The  proposal  for a  Mediterranean agreement cropped up on  numerous occasions during the  winter of 1935-36 in conversations between Signor Mussolini and Sir  Eric Drummond.   The  Duce gave little indication of his desires or intentions beyond suggesting at one  point that ratios for naval and air forces should be fixed; but if the tensions then existing, the dubious prospects of the Abyssinian campaign, and all the evidence of Italian ambitions and intrigues are taken into consideration, we may fairly conclude that his primary object was not so much  the attainment of a permanent and comprehensive settlement  as  relief from temporary embarrassments arising out of the presence of a reinforced British fleet in the Mediterranean.   However that may be, the course  of events did not favour the development of whatever plan for a  Mediterranean agreement he then entertained.                -           -;  ^     6.  At the present time and in any immediate1 future-Italy&apos;s recent acts and declared  intentions must be held to preclude her participation at the same table as ourselves in the negotiation of a general agreement under League auspices forthe restraint  of aggression.   On the other hand, even the  temporary exclusion whatever its duration of Italy from an agreement including all or  most of theother Mediterranean Powers would manifestly  be  regarded as evidence that we intend to apply  a policy of encirclement to  Italy  and would  thus  tend toperpetuate and envenom existing antagonisms.  For that reason it is unlikely that france either could or would ever agree to join  such a pact.   It must be realised that for the present she is, and will continue to be, less sensitive than  ourselves to problems which may arise in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea from theulterior ambitions of a vigorous and victorious dictator, for her attention is being concentrated  more and more closely on Germany,  and  it  is  a fair presumption that her present attitude towards any  kind  of  Mediterranean  Pact will beconditioned by the extent to which it would subserve the policy commonly referred      [13345]                                                    B 2
 to as-the   Stresa Front/&apos;  This means that France will favourcourses-calculated to  restore harmony between the British  and Italian .Governments,  but  will discourage any  agreement regarded  by  Mussolini as designed to- diminish his prestige or circumscribe his Mediterranean policies.  Nor  would it help matters if the Pact contemplated were so constructed as to permit of Italy acceding to it subsequently, for we know by experience that a  Great Power usually in such cases declines to co-operate, on  the ground that she has been presented with  a  fait accompli, and then proceeds to argue that as the Pact is being operated without her, it  must  be  held to  be directed: against her.   Italy would  almost  certainly adopt this attitude..      7.  A Mediterranean Pact is thus seen on examination to be either impracticable- cable or unsuitable for the immediate objects we have in view.  A Pact without Italy is open to manifest objections and dangers; and the time is not yet ripe for a Mediterranean Pact of which Italy would be an original member.  But though for Our immediate purposes the idea of a Mediterranean Pact must be ruled  out, this need not necessarily mean that in different circumstances and  at a later date such a  pact  might not  be useful as a stabilising influence  or  as  a means of replacing international relationships in the Mediterranean on a more normal footing.  But for this one. condition is, and  always will be, essential :  that is, that It-ily must participate with France and Great  Britain as a friend, and not as a potential enemy.     8.   Failing  a general Pact, what  other means are open  to us for dealing with our  three immediate problems  enumerated in paragraph 1 ?    The  following possibilities are  submitted :- r     9.   Method  for deaiiiia with  Problem (1)  (i.e., the guarantee to the Lesser Mediterranean Powers).     The shortest and simplest method would be for Great Britain alone  to make, a. public declaration, both  at  Geneva and in Parliament, to  the  effect  that if. during the I-present transitional period, of crisis, the Mediterranean States which collaborated, with His Majesty&apos;s  Government when Article 16 of the Covenant was being applied  during the sanctions period  were attacked in violation of the Covenant, His Majesty5s Government would come to their assistance in the same manner as had been contemplated during the application of sanctions-.  The draft of a declaration  on these lines is given in an Annex.  If France  would make a similar declaration, so much the better, but it is  not essential.  It will be seen that the circumstances in which the guarantee would operate are carefully restricted and in such way that His Majesty&apos;s Government remain in effect sole judge as to when this is to be applied, and as to when the declaration itself shall be considered to have lapsed.   As to the ability and willingness of  His Majesty&apos;s Government to give effect to such an  undertaking,  it may be hazarded that  in  the case of Turkey and Greece such guarantees would coincide with  British vital interests and would thus  be susceptible of justification to public opinion.   In the case of Yugoslavia, however, it must be confessed that it might be a more difficult matter for His Majesty&apos;s Government to implement them in.  the event of  a war between Yugoslavia and  Italy, especially as the origins of the war might be difficult to disentangle.  But in the circumstances it seems  necessary to take this risk.     10.  Method for dealing  with Problem (2)  (i.e., action  by the Mediterranean Powers to restore the authority of the League in the Mediterranean).      Short of expelling Italy  from the League, which  would create  an added inducement for  her to coalesce with  Germany, the only policy so far suggested has been a general Mediterranean Pact,  the objections  to which have been set forth above.  On the whole, it seems doubtful whether any immediate and limited action by the Mediterranean Powers would in itself restore the general authority of the League.   More far-reaching measures affecting the  essential character of the League as a whole will probably be  found to be necessary to achieve this purpose.      -  -                                                     -  ..      11.  Methods  for dealing with Problem (3) (i.e., the restoration of British maritime strength in the Mediterranean).                      &apos; ;-   For the purposes of this paper  it is taken for granted that  it is vital for both political and  strategic  reasons  that  we  should&apos; maintain  and  secure  our
position in the Mediterranean,- and &quot;that; it- is in the Eastern Mediterranean thatour  interests are particularly  vital, particularly exposed, and  at the same timeleast efficiently  defended.   If, in addition, we have reason to think; that  ouralready weakened position  may be eventually challenged by Italy, we are thenfaced with a situation where three different courses are open tous.   We can eithertry  and restore  our position  by our  own  unaided efforts, that  is  to  say, bypermanently increasing  our naval forces and strengthening our naval bases inthe Mediterranean; or we can;explore the possibilities of coming  to terms with italy; or we can organise  a system of defence  in collaboration with those othercountries which feel themselves threatened by Italian ambitions.     If the first of these courses is held to be insufficient by itself, and if the second is impracticable in present  circumstances, then  we are led inevitably to considerthe possibility of a restricted naval defensive agreement, under League auspices,between Great Britain, Greece  and Turkey.     What are the prospects of our being able to bring about such  an  agreement,and what practical value would be expected to derive from it ?     At the present time Turkey and Greece are  so  uneasy at the prospect of italian aggression  that  in  return for our protection it is  not unreasonable to suppose that we could obtain from them valuable concessions as regards the useof their territorial  waters and harbours by the  British, fleet.  The  grant  of such facilities  would strengthen our position  in  the Eastern  Mediterranean and the balkans;  while the commitment which we would assume to protect the integrity of Turkey and  Greece is one  which British vital interests would impose upon us in  any case.  Turkey might  wish to bring Yugoslavia into this  guaranteescheme, but we  would have to resist  this, as a guarantee  of Yugoslavia would constitute a very real and new  obligation which both politically and strategicallywe would find it very difficult to fulfil;  besides,  Yugoslavia could give us noquid pro quo.  Such an agreement with Turkey  and Greece would not be directed against Italy but against any disturber of the peace in the Eastern Mediterranean,and so long as no other Great Power participated it could not be  held to constitute the encirclement of Italy, any more than a unilateral guarantee by us  of Belgianintegrity, which has been  before  now under consideration, could  be  considered to be a threat to, or the  encirclement of,  Germany.  The political advantages ofsuch an agreement, on the other  hand, are  numerous and important : (a) Theagreement would go far to re-establish  locally belief in our  determination toprotect our  lines; of communication with the Far East;  (&amp;) and consequently to enhance our prestige;  (c)  it would  act  as  a warning  and deterrent to Italy;(d) the agreement  would have a  stabilising influence in Egypt, Palestine and iraq; (e) it would strengthen the Balkan Entente, and indirectly give reassuranceto Yugoslavia and Roumania;  (/) it might be expected to counteract the growinginfluence of Germany in Greece and Turkey.     It is not suggested that this agreement should  be automatically brought intoeffect  on  the  withdrawal  of sanctions.   On the  contrary, as  pointed  out inparagraph 2, the need and  occasion for negotiating this agreement will  dependon events as they may be expected to shape themselves in the  period  following the removal of  sanctions.                   -     Lastly,  it may  be argued that it  is no use for us to increase our strength inthe Eastern Mediterranean  so long as our position in the Western Mediterraneanremains as vulnerable as it is at present, owing to Italy&apos;s ability to threaten malta and command the  routes from Gibraltar to the  Eastern Mediterranean.   Theonly way to get over this  difficulty is to bring France into the scheme, but to bringFrance into the  Anglo-Turco-Greek scheme would at once convert  it into a pactfor  the encirclement of  Italy; besides,  as already pointed out,  France  wouldprobably  refuse &quot;to  lend herself to such a policy, and,  in addition to this, it isdoubtful whether it would  be  to the  advantage of  ourselves, the Turks, or  the greeks, that France should be granted naval facilities in Turkish or  Greek waters,facilities  which France would  certainly ask  for if  they were granted to  us.  Itwould seem, a,s regards the  Western Mediterranan, that Great Britain  must rely-on her. own efforts  to strengthen her  defences.  But, if necessary,  she might beable to arrange with France a special Anglo-French  naval agreement, such asthat which existed before  the  War,  whereby France  undertook to protect our interests in  the Mediterranean in return for. our defending French interests inthe North Sea and the Channel.
    12.  The conclusions to be derived from the above analysis may be summarisedas follows :        I. If sanctions are withdrawn by the League, we ought at once, without          waiting for the French, to state  that we still are ready during the          . present period of  uncertainty to come to the assistance of our recent          collaborators in the Mediterranean in the circumstances  set forth in          the attached draft Declaration.     II. We  ought  not  in  present  circumstances  to  hope  to  restore  the          prestige of the League  by  any special  arrangements regarding the          Mediterranean.    III. The  Chiefs of  Staff  should  be asked  forthwith to  report  on  the          strategical questions raised in this paper, and on the validity of the          assumptions on which the proposals in this paper are based.    IV. When we see, after sanctions have  been withdrawn, how the situation          develops, we ought subject to the views of the Chiefs  of Staff to          consider further the question  of  an Eastern Mediterranean  under-          standing with Turkey and Greece on the lines suggested in this paper.      V. While  a  general Mediterranean  Pact without  Italy  would  in all          circumstances be open to serious objection, the time  may come when          some  sort of Mediterranean Pact, including France and Italy, may          prove useful as part of,  and in order to facilitate, a general detente          with Italy.  We have not, however, at present reached the stage when          such a step need be contemplated.June 10, 1936.
                                 ANNEX.                            DRAFT  DECLARATION.    ON the occasion of the removal of the measures imposed on the 11th october last against  Italy  in  virtue  of Article 16  of  the Covenant,  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom desire to call the attention of the Council tothe memorandum which they presented to the Co-ordinating Committee on the22nd January, regarding the results  of the exchanges of views which had takenplace  between His Majesty&apos;s Government  and certain other  Governments inconnexion with the application of Article 16 of the Covenant.    In paragraph 10 of that memorandum it is stated that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment had given reciprocal assurances to the  Governments of Turkey,  Greece and yugoslavia, to the effect that they intended faithfully to apply all the obligationsdevolving  upon them under the  Covenant in consequence of the measures takenin the application of Article 16.    Since the conditions in which these assurances were given will come to an endwith the  removal  of the measures  to which I have referred. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom now declare for their part that if Turkey,Greece and Yugoslavia should be the victims of an act of unprovoked aggressioncommitted  in violation of the Covenant and arising out of  the collaboration ofthe Governments of these three countries with His Majesty&apos;s Government duringthe recent period when Article 16 was being applied, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill at once assist the country so attacked in the same manner as was contemplated in the  exchanges of view between His  Majesty&apos;s  Government and  these three governments  last December.    It will be  appreciated that this declaration  is made  with the object of removing  certain preoccupations which  may exist in the present transitional period and is  intended to operate only so long as, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, it  remains appropriate  to the existing  circumstances.
