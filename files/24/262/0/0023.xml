IRISH SITUATION COJ.MITT.EE.             Pl^POSED APPOINTMENT OF A UNITED KINGDOM HIGH                &quot;COMMISSIONER: IN THE IRISH FREE  STATE.                             REPORT.      1.      Ac  their Meeting on May 6th,  1956 (Cahinet 34 (36)      Conclusion 9)  the Cahinet agreed inter alia to refer to the      Irish Situation Committee a Memorandum (CP.  124 (36))  &quot;by  the      Secretary  of State for  Dominion Affairs on the relations between      this country and the Irish Free State.      2o      At  the  request of the Secretary of  State we examined at      the outset the proposal mentioned in paragraph 7 of the Memorandum      for the appointment of  a United Kingdom High Commissioner  in the      Irish Free State.      3.       We agree that this proposal  can he isolated from the      other proposals in the  Memorandum and treated on its merits.      United Kingdom High Commissioners are already functioning  with      success in Canada,  Australia and South Africa, and proving a      valuahle part  of the machinery for  Imperial consultation and co-      operation.  We attach  considerable  importance to His Majesty&apos;s      Government being represented in the  Irish  Free State by a      responsible official who would be in close and constant contact      with Free  State Ministers,  and who would not  only act as a channel      of  day to  day  communication &quot;between  the two Governments, but who      would he in a  position  to keep His Majesty&apos;s  Government much      better informed than is the case today of  all developments in the      Irish Free State,  and generally to promote the improvement of      Anglo-Irish relations.                                  -1-
       4.      The  Secretary  of  Strte helieves  that  the proposal would       be  acceptable  in principle  to Mr. De Valera  and,  if  the       Cabinet approve it, it is proposed to sound  him informally  in       the first instance.   There  is no reason to suppose that the       Government  of  Northern Ireland would object  to the proposal.       5.      The  selection  of  the person to fill the post  is entirely       within the  discretion of the United Kingdom  Government, though       naturally in making the  selection regard must he  had to       considerations such as that the appointee should  he  likely  to       he  a persona grata to the Free State Government,,   The success       of  the experiment will very largely depend on finding the right       man for the post, and great care will have to he  exercised  in       the selection  of the  first High Commissioner.       6.      The  Secretary  of  State for Dominion Affairs has under       consideration  the appointment of a United Kingdom High       Commissioner in New Zealand,,  If it is  decided to create High       Commissioner-ships in  New Zealand and the Irish Free  State,  it       is  for consideration  whether it might not he politically       advantageous to cover the two posts in  a single announcement.       7.      We recommend the  Cahinet :                      To approve, in principle, the proposal                      of the Secretary of State for Dominion                      Affairs  for the appointment  of a  United                      Kingdom  High Commissioner in the  Irish                      Free  State, and to authorise the  Secretary                      of State to ascertain from Mr. De Valera                      informally whether such an appointment                      would he acceptahle to  him.                             Signed on &quot;behalf of the Committee.                                    STANLEY BALDWIN,                                       Chairman.,  Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1.
