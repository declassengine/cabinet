CP. 168  (36).CABINET.THE  MONTREUX  CONFERENCE  TO  CONSIDER  THE  REVISION         OF THE  STRAITS  CONVENTION  OF  LAUSANNE.         &apos;         Memorandum  by  the Secretary of State  for Foreign Affairs.    AS my colleagues are aware, arrangements have been made for a conference?to be held at Montreux  on  the 22nd June to consider the revision of the Straits-Convention of Lausanne.   The events which have led up to this conference arebriefly as follows.  On the 11th April the Turkish Ambassador handed in a noteexpressing the desire of the  Turkish Government to secure the revision of this&apos;--Convention, and suggesting that a conference of the interested parties should beheld to consider it.  The main desideratum of the Turkish Government was toobtain the right to refortify the Straits, on the ground that the guarantee ofprotection  contained. in Article 18 of the Straits  Convention, which had  beengiven to the Turks in consideration of their agreement to the demilitarisation of&apos;the Straits, was no longer  of any value in present conditions.  We had already-been  fully informed of the anxiety  of the Turks  to secure the right of;&apos;remilitarisation of the Straits, and the matter had been considered by the Chiefs;&apos;of Staff Sub-Committee, who had agreed that the balance of advantage from the-:point of view of British interests would be in allowing the Turks the right they;desire.  I  accordingly replied  to the  Turkish Ambassador on the  16th ApriLinforming  him that for their  part His  Majesty&apos;s Government  in the UnitedKingdom would gladly agree to a conference of the interested Powers to be held&apos;at a place and date convenient to all concerned.  I added that I understood that:the only parts of the Convention which the Turks desired to modify were the:so-called demilitarisation clauses.                                            &apos;i    2.  The whole question was informally discussed with the Turkish Minister,for Foreign Affairs at Geneva during the last Council meeting  of the League,and with  the Secretary-General  of  the Turkish  Ministry  for Foreign Affairsduring the latter&apos;s visit to England at the end of May, and, as a result, M. Aras,&apos;on the 29th May, addressed a formal invitation to His Majesty&apos;s  Government inthe United Kingdom  to send representatives to  a conference  to be held at&apos;Montreux on the 22nd June, a date and place which he had assured himself would:suit all concerned.  In view of  the discussions which had already taken place, Iinformed M. Aras that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom wouldbe glad to agree to this, and to send a delegation to the  conference.    3.  I  may explain that the  matter has already been  very fully discussed withthe Dominions  Office, and  that the Dominions have been kept  fully informed.The position in regard to them  is that, as the original Convention was signed onbehalf of  the British Empire, and ratified  by the King on behalf of the whole empire,  together  with  the  rest of  the Peace  Settlement with  Turkey,  theDominions and India are in fact parties to the Convention.  Indeed, if they werenot, they would still be at war with Turkey.  Turkey can only be legally released from  any  of  her  obligations  under the Convention with the consent of all  theparties to that instrument, and the concurrence of the Dominions will therefore       [13366]          -   ,     ,, Printed for the Cabinet.

be required in any amending  Convention which may result from the impendingconference.  The Commonwealth of Australia has decided to&quot;be separately repre-sented at the conference, but it seems probable that arrangements will have to bemade for the majority of the other Dominions to indicate their acceptance of theConclusions of the conference in some other manner.  Discussions on this questionnaire actively proceeding, and a satisfactory arrangement has already been come toon this point with the Irish Free State. Meanwhile the Turkish Government have sent a  separate telegram asking  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  in  the UnitedKingdom  to invite, on their behalf, all the  Dominion Governments  to be repre-sented.  This invitation has been transmitted to its destinations.    4   It has been arranged that Lord Stanhope shall lead the United kingdom delegation, and arrangements have been made for the whole delegation, includingthe necessary experts, to leave  London on Saturday, the 20th June. The proposals is that the conference should hold plenary meetings for four days, i.e.,  until theopening meeting of the Council of the League at Geneva on the 28th June, whenseveral of the delegates to the Montreux conference would  have to go to Geneva.It would then split up into technical committees, and there  seems some hope that,unless agreement is unduly delayed, some amending instrument may be ready for signature immediately after the meeting  of  the Assembly of  the  League,i.e., early in July.    5.  In view of the report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee referred toin paragraph 1 above, I propose that Lord Stanhope should  be authorised to agreeat once to the abrogation of  those Articles of the  existing Straits convention which provide for the demilitarisation of the Straits Zone.  I may explain thatif the Turks had decided to follow  the example of  Germany and repudiate theStraits Convention unilaterally, we should, in fact, not have been able to prevent them from doing so.  The fact that they have  acted in so proper and correct a manner in trying to secure the revision of this treaty instrument by negotiation and agreement,  gives them a  very strong claim to&quot; favourable treatment.  It is,in fact, most important  on general grounds that it should be made clear that treaty revision  by agreement can  pay  as  well  as,  or  better than, unilateralrepudiation.  Moreover, we have the strongest  interest, from  the political pointof view,  in  developing  and  strengthening  the friendly  relations at  presentexisting between Turkey and ourselves, and in responding to her recent  advances in this direction.  I therefore consider that from every point of view it is mostimportant that this concession which we could not in any  case resist should bemade as generously and completely as possible from the outset.    6.  The Turks have also indicated that they intend to  press for the  revisionof the clauses of the  Convention dealing with  the passage of warships  throughthe Straits.  This question has formed the  subject of considerable unofficialdiscussion with  representatives of  the  Turkish Government  and between  theForeign Office and the Admiralty, and there seems  no reason to anticipate  anyinsuperable  difficulty  in  reaching  agreement  as  to  what can reasonably  be conceded to the Turks in this direction.  In these circumstances I suggest, for theconsideration of my  colleagues,  that Lord Stanhope should  be  authorised toaccept any solution on which the Foreign Office  and Admiralty agree.  i;  7.  I should add that the other Departments of His Majesty&apos;s  Governmenthave been kept fully informed throughout these discussions, and that I  have noreason to believe that any of them dissent from the course of action proposed.June  15, 1936.A.
