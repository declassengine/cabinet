THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  April 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.  4CP. 123 (36).CABINET.QUESTIONS TO BE ADDRESSED  TO  THE  GERMAN  GOVERNMENT.          Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    WHEN the four Locarno Powers last met in Geneva on Good Friday,  the10th April, the  French  claimed  with justice that Germany had  made  no contribution to the restoration of confidence  prior  to the opening of  generalnegotiations.   She had refused to  accept the reference to The Hague Court orto give any substantial satisfaction respecting  the provisional arrangements inthe Rhineland.   The French  argued, therefore, that the effort of conciliationattempted in the  Text of  Proposals of the 19th March had failed; and though they were willing to admit that we  should continue our consideration  of  theGerman proposals, they asked  that, in case the Germans  should follow up theirreoccupation of the  Rhineland by the erection of fortifications, a preliminarystudy of sanctions should be begun. The French also let it be known that if  theGermans fortified the zone they would require some additional &apos;&apos; compensation &apos;&apos;which was understood to be particularly some additional  security for the states in Central and Eastern Europe, who would be increasingly cut off from the West.The  French stated  that  they regarded our  agreement  to  the General staff conversations as &quot; compensation &quot; for  the reoccupation of  the Rhineland, but  not for its fortification, which primarily concerned Central and Eastern Europe.    2.   Lord Halifax and I strongly  resisted the French view that the attempt at conciliation had failed and that it was time to begin the study of  sanctions.We  took  advantage of  the  indication  that  the  French  were  looking  for&quot; compensation &quot;  for the fortification  of the Rhineland to point out that, on  the admission of all of us, the German  proposals were far from clear on a number of points;  that some of those points, if explained in a satisfactory way, might givethe French the very &quot; compensation &quot;  they were looking for;  and that therefore the first step  was to clear  up these doubtful points with the Germans.   TheFrench  agreed to  this  and  we  secured  the communique  attached  to  thismemorandum,  which stated that &quot; the representatives of the United Kingdom will get into touch with  the  German Government  for the elucidation  of  a certainnumber of points  in  the German memorandum.&quot;    3.   We are then pledged to the French to try to clear up these points withthe Germans;  and we further agreed in the Geneva Communique that amongthese points should be those referred to in one  of  the French memoranda givenus at Geneva.  Since then the French Ambassador has given to Sir R. Vansittarta note which I think covers the points in which the French are interested.    4.   Moreover, our own examination in the Foreign  Office of the Germanmemoranda, particularly those  of the 24th March and 31st March, had  convincedus that there were therein a number of points which were very equivocal and thatit would be essential to clear them up at  an early stage.   Apart from the factthat to leave them in  doubt might expose us to unpleasant surprises in the future,it cannot  be too strongly emphasised that what  His Majesty&apos;s Government is.    8564   [13131]                                                 B
2aiming at is a lasting settlement and it is hopeless to expect such a settlementunless we can get the Germans to say beyond all doubt that it is one which willsatisfy them.     5.  Among the important points in the German memoranda which are not clear are :      (1) The question  whether Germany now regards herself as  possessed of           &quot; complete equality,&quot; under which condition only,  in her own words,           can she conclude &quot;genuine treaties.&quot;     (2) The character of the non-aggression pacts proposed by  Germany and their           relationship with the Covenant of the League of Nations.     (3) The meaning of the phrases &quot;colonial equality  of  rights&quot; and  &quot;the           separation of the Covenant of the League of Nations from the Treaty           of Versailles.&quot;   It  is essential to elucidate these as, though they are           not described by Germany as conditions of her re-entry into the League          of Nations, we could not ourselves support her return there without          the certainty that we and she understood these phrases in the same          manner.    6.  The draft despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin, which is annexed to this memorandum, will  show, I think, that it should be possible todiscuss these  matters  with the German Government in  a most friendly  andcourteous manner.   But to content  ourselves  with anything less than completeclarity would be a neglect for which we should rightly  be held responsible inENCLOSURE.         Draft of  a Despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin.Sir,     YOUR Excellency will have read the memoranda communicated to me by thelate Herr von Hoesch, on the 7th March, 1936, and by Herr von Ribbentrop on the24th March and the 1st April, 1936, respecting  the reoccupation of the de militaires-tarised zone and the peace proposals of the German Government.    2.  Certain of these proposals deal, as your Excellency is aware, withtemporary  arrangements in the demilitarised zone pending  the completion ofthe first  stage of the  general negotiations for the peace of Europe  which were proposed by the German  Government.   On these temporary arrangements it isnot my purpose to comment in the present despatch, though your Excellency knowsthat His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom regret that the GermanGovernment have not been able to make a more substantial contribution towardsthe re-establishment of  the confidence which is such an essential preliminary tothe wide negotiations which they have in view.    3.  In the course of my interview with Herr von Ribbentrop on the 2nd April,I informed his Excellency that His Majesty&apos;s Government regard the proposalsfor the future in the German memorandum of the  31st March (that communicatedto me on the 1st April) as most important  and  as deserving of  careful study.This study is  now  at an  advanced stage; but His Majesty&apos;s  Government  find difficulty in carrying it further without discussing more closely with the GermanGovernment (as foreshadowed in the Geneva communique of  the  10th April) acertain number of  points  in the three memoranda, particularly in those  of  the24th and 31st March.   His Majesty&apos;s Government feel sure that the GermanGovernment will share their view that the greatest possible precision is desirablebefore any general negotiations can open, in order that in the future no misunder-standings may cloud the confident co-operation of  the Powers of Europe, which itis the most earnest hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as they are sure also of  theGerman Government, that  the proposed negotiations may advance.    4.  There are  a number of passages in the German memoranda of the 24thand 31st March which leave  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in  some doubt as  tothe conception held by the German Government of  the basis upon which the future settlement should be founded. .                              j  *
     5.   The first point on which it is desirable to be clear is whether Germany now regards herself as possessed of that &apos;&apos; complete equality &apos;&apos; which, in her own words, is the condition under which alone she can conclude &quot; genuine treaties.&quot; There are passages in the second sub-paragraph of paragraph 1 of the German Governments memorandum of the 24th March, 1936, which seem to suggest that it is the view of the German Government that by their action in the Rhineland they have fulfilled this condition.   On the other hand,  there are passages in paragraph 2 of the memorandum of the 24th March which might be capable of a different interpretation.   These latter passages may be held to suggest that Germany&apos;s &quot; complete equality &quot; has, in the  view of the German Government, not yet been achieved.  His Majesty&apos;s Government would not themselves wish to draw any such conclusion, but they would be glad  to have a clear declaration from the German Government on this point, in order to dissipate any uncertainty which may remain.    6.   In so far as the argument  set out in  paragraph 6 of the German Govern - ment&apos;s memorandum of the 31st March is intended to be of general application, it might give rise to doubt as to the view which the German Government take of the continued maintenance in force of the  remaining operative  clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, and, indeed,  of any agreement,  such as the recent Anglo- German  Naval Agreement, which  might be said to have had its origin in the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles.  While His Majesty&apos;s  Government do not wish to enter into controversy with the German Government  on this point, they wish to make it clear that they are unable to accept the historical interpretation of events set forth in that paragraph.   Their views are embodied in a separate memorandum (see Annex).    7.   There is in paragraph 4 of the memorandum of the 31st March a further cause for uncertainty.  It is stated  in that paragraph that  &quot; the  German Government  have received from the  German People (&apos; Volk &apos;) a solemn general mandate to represent the Reich and the German nation (nation) &apos;&apos; to carry out a policy  which  implies  the preservation  under  all  circumstances  of  &quot; their freedom,  their independence and  at the same time their equality of  status.&quot; A distinction is apparently drawn between the Reich and the German  nation. Is any significance to be attached to this distinction, and, if so, what is it? His Majesty&apos;s Government assume that both words apply only to populations within the existing frontiers of Germany.    8.   From what has been said above, the German Government will, I am surer appreciate the necessity for a clear  definition of their attitude on these important points.  There might otherwise be  uncertainty as to Germany&apos;s attitude towards such questions  as the existing territorial or  political status of France,  Belgium,. Denmark, Czechoslovakia and Poland; of Soviet Russia and the Baltic States; of Memel and Danzig (as regards the status of Memel, in particular, the reference to- the &quot;effective development&quot; of  &quot;the  guaranteed  autonomy  of  the  Memel Territory&quot; in the penultimate paragraph of the German  Government&apos;s memo- randum of the 7th March is not clear); and of Austria, the territorial or political status of all of which to some extent derive from the Treaty of Versailles or were recognised by Germany thereby.    9.   I turn now to other matters.  Sub-paragraph 13 of paragraph 22 of the memorandum of the 31st  March refers to  &quot;the conclusion .of an Air  Pact  to supplement and reinforce  these (Western European)  security agreements.&quot;  In the spring of 1935 the German Government was understood to  hold that the negotiation of an Air Pact should not be complicated by an attempt to accompany it by an agreement  for the limitation of air forces.   Since  then a  somewhat contradictory position seems to have arisen.  In the Reichstag on the 21st May,. 1935, Herr Hitler  mentioned the possibility  of an agreement for  air limitation on the basis of parity between the great Western Powers, provided, so we under- stood, that the development of the Soviet air force was not  such that revisionwould be necessary.  The  Chancellors  speech of the 2.1st May, 1935, was made after the signature  of the Franco-Soviet  Ti*treaty; yet  in  December  1935 he informed your Excellency  that that Treaty had made  air  limitation impossible.A decision not  to attempt to accompany a Western Air Pact by  a  regionalagreement  for limitation of air strengths would be very much regretted by HisMajesty&apos;s  Government;&apos; and the  statement  in  paragraph 2 of the  German      [13131]                                                    B 2
memorandum/that the German Government are impressed by the results achieved in the  limited sphere  of  the recent agreement  respecting naval  armamentsencourages them to hope that the German Government will be able to fall in withtheir views on  this point.     10.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are gratified to see that, in sub-paragraphs 10and  14 of  paragraph 22 of  the memorandum of  the 31st March,  the GermanGovernment propose the conclusion of non-aggression pacts between Germany,on the  one hand, and France, Belgium and  possibly Holland  on the  other.They note that the German Government are willing that these pacts should be accompanied by treaties of guarantee.  The exact form which these instrumentswill  assume must be a matter for detailed negotiation.     His Majesty&apos;s Government also note the proposal in  sub-paragraph 17 ofparagraph  22  for non-aggression pacts between  Germany and  the  States  on germany&apos;s south-eastern and north-eastern frontiers.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould venture to recall the general outline of such pacts given to Sir John Simonhy Baron von Neurath in Berlin on the 26th March, 1935.  They would be glad toknow whether the German Government  suggest that these pacts should followgenerally that outline,  and whether  they  agree  that these pacts also  may be guaranteed by mutual  assistance arrangements.     The announcement which the German Government have been able to make ofGermany&apos;s readiness to re-enter the League of Nations permits  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to assume that no difficulty  will arise as regards the conformity ofthe proposed non-aggression pacts with the  obligations of members of the Leagueof Nations, and that the operation of these pacts will take  place Avithin  the framework of the Covenant.     There are two further points to Avhich  attention should be drawn.  The firstconcerns the meaning of the words &quot; the States on Germany&apos;s south-eastern-and north-eastern  frontiers.&quot;   His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot but feel that  thewhole settlement  Avould be very greatly  facilitated if the  German  Governmentcould see their way to interpret these words so as to cover at least  also the soviet union, Latvia and Estonia, as well as  the States actually contiguous  to Germany.In this connexion His Majesty&apos;s Government would venture  to recall that in their memorandum  of  the 26th March, 1935, the German Government  stated their readiness to conclude pacts  of non-aggression Avith  &quot; the Powers interested in east European questions.&quot;     The second is that of  non-interference in  the  affairs of other States, as distinct  from  non-aggression  against them.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government recallwith satisfaction the Chancellor&apos;s statement in the Reichstag on the 21st May,1935, that  the German Government were  &quot;ready at any  time  to  agree  to  aninternational arrangement Avhich will effectively prevent and render impossibleall attempts to interfere  from  outside  in  the affairs of  other  States.&quot;  HisMajesty&apos;s  Government assume  that  this   is still  the  vieAv of the GermanGovernment.     11.  In sub-paragraph 18 of paragraph 22 of the German memorandum ofthe 31st March the German Government  &quot; express their expectation that withina reasonable time (after Germany&apos;s return to the League of Nations) and by meansof friendly negotiations the question of colonial equality of  rights  will be cleared up.&quot;  His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that this is a matter which will  not come under discussion in the present negotiations,  but  at some later  stage aclarification of the German standpoint would appear to be desirable.     12.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the German Government willthink it desirable to give some early definition of the phrase &quot; the separation ofthe Covenant of the League of Nations from its basis in the Treaty of Versaillessetting,&quot; which occurs in sub-paragraph 18  of paragraph 22.     13.  In sub-paragraph  19  of  paragraph  22  &quot;Germany  proposes  theconstitution of an international court of arbitration which shall have competence inrespect  of the observance  of the various agreements  concluded.&quot;   Presumably,these agreements are those mentioned in sub-paragraphs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,  14  and17 of paragraph 22.  It Avould be desirable to know generally the functions  and constitution of the proposed court and the relation which the former would bearto the functions of the Council of the League of Nations and of the PermanentCourt of International Justice.
    In view  of  the  announcement of Germany&apos;s willingness to return to theLeague of Nations, the German Government will, no doubt, be willing to indicate their future  attitude towards the Permanent Court  of  International  Justice(particularly  in  relation  to the  Optional Clause) and  towards  the  variousprovisions for arbitration, conciliation or judicial settlement contained in treatiesto which Germany is a party.    14.   His Majesty&apos;s Government  request that your Excellency will  see theChancellor at an early  date, when you should leave with him a copy  of  this despatch.   Memorandum on the Historical Argument in Paragraph 6 of the German                      Memorandum of March 31, 1936.    THE argument in paragraph 6 of the memorandum of the 31st Marchappears to be that the Fourteen Points of President Wilson did not &apos;&apos; contemplate any limitation  of  German sovereignty  in  the  Rhine  territory,&quot;  and that the demilitarised zone clauses were  therefore &apos;&apos; a breach of conditions which werebinding on the Allies &quot; ; that &quot; these provisions of the  Treaty of Versailles wereincorporated into the Locarno Treaty after a further infringement of right, theoccupation of the Ruhr, which was characterised as a breach of international lawby British Law Officers of the Crown,&quot; and that the Treaty of Locarno was nota freely signed treaty at all.    2.   It is true that the Fourteen Points did not &apos;&apos; contemplate any limitation ofGerman sovereignty in the Rhine territory,&quot; but they did not purport to deal withthe demilitarisation of the Rhineland or with the disarmament of Germany assuch.   A  very  substantial indication  that,  at  the time,  the demilitarisationclauses were not held by Germany to be inconsistent with the Fourteen Points orthe Armistice terms is to be found in the fact that the  German delegation to thePeace Conference of 1919 never made this objection, or, indeed, any objection, tothe demilitarisation clauses.    3.   It is permissible to recall that, even after the occupation of the Ruhr,   .the German  Government,  in making/a note of the 20th January, 1925, the original //&apos;??proposal for the Treaty subsequently signed at Locarno, stated that  its object would be &quot;to secure peace between Germany and France&quot;; and that a &quot; pactexpressly guaranteeing the present territorial  status on  the  Rhine  would be acceptable to Germany.  The purport of such a pact could be, for instance, thatthe interested  States  bound themselves reciprocally to observe the inviolabilityof the present territorial status  on the Rhine,  that they, furthermore, bothconjointly and individually guaranteed the fulfilment of this  obligation, and,finally, that they would regard any action running counter to the said obligationas affecting them jointly and individually.  In the same sense the treaty states could guarantee in this pact the fulfilment of the obligation to  demilitarise theRhineiand which Germany has undertaken in Articles 42  and 43  of the Treaty ofVersailles.&quot;    4.  Finally, it  may be recalled  that as  recently as  the 21st  May,  1935,Herr  Hitler  stated in  the Reichstag  that  the German Government  &quot; willscrupulously observe  every treaty  voluntarily  signed  by them.  They will,therefore, in particular, observe and  fulfil all  obligations arising out of the locarno Pact so long as the other parties to the Treaty are also willing to adhere to the said Pact.&quot;   There was no reference to the circumstances  of dm^ess underwhich the German Government now apparently  consider the Treaty of Locarnoto have been signed;   nor was there any reservation respecting its continuedobservance by Germany other than that relating to the willingness of the other parties to the Treaty to adhere to it.
