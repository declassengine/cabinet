Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1938.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 167  (36).CABINET.RELATIONS WITH THE  IRISH FREE STATE.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.     ON Wednesday afternoon,  June 10th, Mr. Dulanty, the High Commissionerfor the Irish Free State, came to see me.  Before Whitsuntide I had asked himto let Mr. De Valera know that the  Cabinet, believing  that  the presence of a united Kingdom  High  Commissioner in the Irish Free  State  would  be ofassistance in promoting good relations between our two countries, wished me to sound him informally on the question.  Mr. Dulanty had been going to Dublinin any case during the recess, and took that opportunity of raising the matter withthe President.  He  came to tell me the result.  Mr. De Valera was averse to theappointment of  a High Commissioner at  present.   He was having considerable difficulties with  the extreme Republicans,  and was engaged in a campaign ofarrests, prosecutions and imprisonments against them.  At such a moment itwas inexpedient for him to agree to the appointment  of  a  United kingdom representative in Dublin, since this would prompt  his critics to say that he wasallied with the  United Kingdom against  Irish Republicans.  He thought thatit might  be  possible to  consider the  question again later on, if the present difficulties in the Irish Free State  were overcome.   I told Mr. Dulanty that Twould report Mr. De Valera&apos;s views to my  colleagues.     Mr. Dulanty then informed me that Mr. De Valera had on the same occasiontalked a great deal about the new Irish Free State Constitution Bill, which, as hehad just publicly announced, he intended to introduce into the Dail in the autumn.He told Mr. Dulanty that he was already preparing a document on the question,which he would send to him for submission to the King. The document had sincearrived, and that morning Mr. Dulanty had handed it to Lord Wigram, to besubmitted to the King &quot; for the information, of Your Majesty.&quot;     Mr. Dulanty then showed me a copy of the document.  He explained thathe  was actually exceeding his instructions in letting  me see  its  text;  his instructions were to acquaint me with its substance.  Mr. De Valera had wishedhim to  do this  as a matter of  courtesy, so that I  might know what the IrishFree State Government  had in mind.  After a preamble to the effect that the-Irish Free State Governments objects were the establishment  of conditions for permanent peace and harmony  amongst the Irish people, and of  a basis forfriendship and  co-operation  with  the people  of  Great Britain,  the documentannounced the Governments intention to introduce in the autumn a Bill  to setup  a new Constitution.   The changes would concern the  internal affairs of theFree State,  &quot; leaving unaffected the constitutional usages  relating to external affairs.&quot;  Amongst  the new provisions  would be &quot; the creation of the office of aPresident, elected by the people, and  the  abolition of the  office of Governor-General.&quot;     I said to Mr. Dulanty that I wished to be quite clear as to his instructions.He had  observed that he  was  giving me this information &quot;as  a matter ofcourtesy.&quot;   Did  he  intend to convey that,  in his Governments view,  this was amatter in  which the United Kingdom Government was not  concerned ?  Hereplied that this  was so.    I said that I appreciated Mr. De Valera&apos;s action in giving me this importantinformation in those circumstances, but felt bound to say more than that.  I had      [13363]
only just received the information which he had been good&quot;enough to give me, andhad not had time to give it careful thought.   Therefore what I said was personal and tentative.  But  it  was possible that my colleagues  and  I,  after carefulconsideration, would reach the conclusion that his communication involved matters in which  the  United Kingdom Government were concerned.   For example, didnot the action  proposed regarding  the  Governor-General  involve the  treaty between our two countries ?  Moreover,  the  reference to an  elected  Presidentmight have an even greater significance.  On examination we might decide that,in our view, that change in the Constitution would affect the whole relationship of the Irish Free State to the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Therefore,whilst thanking Mr.  De Valera for his courtesy,  I  must reserve  completely theposition of the United Kingdom Government on the matter.    Mr. Dulanty said that, with regard to the relation of the Constitution to theTreaty, he understood  that Mr.  De  Valera  held the view that the-Statute of westminster had given  the Irish Free State the right to make of its own free willalterations in the Constitution without regard to the terms of the  Treaty.  Withregard to the other point which I had mentioned, Mr. Dulanty said he was notacquainted  with the details of  Mr.  De Valera&apos;s proposals concerning thePresident, but he was expecting to receive a memorandum on this question shortly.    I  said that I would convey to  my colleagues the information which he had given me.  At that  he  showed some nervousness, saying that he was not sure whether his instructions had  envisaged such a procedure.  Mr. De Valera had asked him to convey the information to me personally; probably it was intended that the information should go further, but he would like to make sure of that.   Ireplied that, whether his instructions had envisaged my telling my colleagues ornot, I  was going to tell them.  He would appreciate that I could not have this information and withhold it from the Cabinet; that was an impossible position.But I  was anxious to avoid any misunderstanding between Mr. De Valera and either himself or me.  If he wished to telephone to Mr. De Valera to make sure ofhis instructions, that need not  take long. He would no doubt be able so to conduct the conversation that  any  misunderstanding  that  might exist  regarding his instructions was satisfactorily cleared up.  In any case, he must understand thatas early as possible on  the following day  I would acquaint the Prime minister with the information which had been given to me, and that I would report it tothe full Cabinet at the earliest opportunity. Mr. Dulanty said that he understoodthis, and that he felt sure that his instructions must have envisaged this, but thathe would like an opportunity of getting this stated in terms by Mr. De Valera.    He was not actually able to confirm this until late on the following afternoon,owing  to the fact that Mr. De  Valera was  not available for a  telephone conversa-tion.  But then a conversation with one  of Mr. De Valera&apos;s secretaries  confirmed the instructions.  In a further interview with me Mr. Dulanty emphasised  againthat I  had been acquainted with the substance of the message to the King purelyas a matter of courtesy, and that its communication must not be taken to mean that his Government considered the United  Kingdom Government in any wayconcerned in the matter.  I replied that  I understood this.   At the same time must again make  it  clear  that my  colleagues and I,  having received theinformation, were absolutely free to consider it,  to decide whether in our  view the United Kingdom  Government were concerned, and if in our opinion we were concerned, to take any action which we  thought appropriate.  Mr. Dulanty saidthat he understood this  position.    In the meantime I  had discussed the situation with  the  Attorney-General,and we had both discussed it with the Prime Minister.  It seemed to us that thefirst object which we should endeavour  to achieve was to keep His Majesty outof any controversy that  might arise, and that this would be best achieved  if weinformed  him of the position at  once;  Following further discussions with thePrime Minister, the Lord President, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the HomeSecretary  and the Attorney-General,  I  sent a letter to Lord Wigram early thenext (Friday)  morning.   A copy of the  letter is attached as Appendix I to thismemorandum.    Shortly after the letter had been despatched I asked Mr. Dulanty to come and see me, when I informed him of its substance, and asked  him to convey this,as a matter of courtesy, to Mr. De Valera. I  pointed out to  him that  the  letterexpressed  no opinion and tendered  no advice.  It merely  informed the King  ofthe position at the moment.
    That afternoon Mr. Dulanty telephoned to me to say that Mr. Walshe,  theSecretary to the Department of External Affairs in Dublin, to whom presumablyhe had telephoned the message for Mr. De Valera,  had been &apos;&apos; perturbed &apos;&apos;  by  ourletter.  His objection appeared to be that it was unconstitutional for the UnitedKingdom Government to &apos;&apos; butt in &apos;&apos; at Buckingham Palace on a matter whichwas of concern to the Irish Free State Government alone. I reminded Mr. Dulantythat the communication to Lord Wigram  itself explained that we were not, atthis  stage at any rate,  &apos;&apos; butting in &quot;; it contained information only, and noadvice.  Mr. Dulanty said that Mr. Waishe understood this, but that he appearedto think it was not proper for us in this situation to communicate with The Kingat all.  I replied to the High Commissioner that I  was grateful to him for givingme this hint of the  view taken by one of Mr. De Valera&apos;s advisers.  I would beprepared to discuss the point if Mr. De Valera himself asked him to raise it.    We may hear further from Dublin on this point.    This morning (Monday) I have  received from Lord  Wigram a reply to myletter to him.   A.  copy of  his reply  is  attached  as  Appendix  II to  thismemorandum.    The Attorney-General  is now engaged in examining  the implications of  theinformation which Mr. De Valera asked Mr. Dulanty to convey to me.    I suggest that the situation created should be examined in the first place bythe Irish Situation  Committee, which is already considering the questions raised in my memorandum on Relations with the Irish Free State [CP. 124 (36)].Dominions Office, June 15, 1936.(Initialled)      M.

APPENDIX  I.                          Letter to Lord Wigram.Dear Lord Wigram,                          Downing Street June 12, 1936.     I THINK that the King should know that the High Commissioner for theIrish Free State has informed me that Mr. De Valera has submitted to the Kinga document concerning his proposals for the amendment of the Constitution of theIrish Free State.  Mr. Dulanty added that he was authorised to acquaint me withthe substance of the document.  He stated that this was being done as a matterof courtesy, and was in no sense an admission by the Irish Free State Governmentthat the Government of the United Kingdom were concerned. I made it clear tohim that I understood this, but that my colleagues and I must be free to considerhis communication and to decide whether, in our view, matters of common concernwere involved.  Mr. Dulanty said  that he understood this position.     The issues raised are clearly of very great importance,  which  it  will benecessary  for the United Kingdom Government to consider very carefully, and Iam accordingly taking steps to inform the Cabinet immediately of the information which I have received.  In the meantime, I have had an opportunity of consulting the Prime Minister and some other of my colleagues, and it is with their approvalthat I am  sending you this letter.                                    &quot;iOixrs smccrGiv                                  (Signed)  &apos;  MALCOLM MACDONALD.Colonel the Rt. Hon.     The Lord Wigram, G.C.B., G.C.V.O., C.S.I.APPENDIX II.                         Reply from Lord Wigram.Dear Secretary of State,                  Buckingham, Palace, June 13, 1936.    I HAVE laid your letter of the 12th June before The King, who wishesme to thank you for informing him regarding the communication made to youby the High Commissioner for the Irish Free State.    His Majesty hopes that,  should matters of common concern arise, thejr willbe settled in a spirit of co-operation and goodwill.                                                     Yours sincerely,                                                (Signed)       WIGRAM.    The Right Honourable        The Secretary of State for the Dominions.
