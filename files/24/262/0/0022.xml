This Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s                       Government.                                                       Copy ho,40.SECRET.CP.152  (36).                                 0 A B I H  E T.                               PALES TIN E.            Memoran dun &quot;by  the  Secretary of State  for  the  Colonies.          My colleagues will remember that at their meeting ofthe 1st of April, 1935 (Cabinet 25 (36) Conclusion 7), theCahinet approved the recommendation that an Arah deputation from Palestine should he given an opportunity of coming toLondon to state their case, and at the meeting of the 8th ofApril (Cahinet 28 (36)) I reported that this invitation hadbeen accepted and that the deputation was expected to arrive in London early in May.          The situation since then has been considerablychanged by developments in Palestine.   As the Cahinet willhe aware from the&apos; telegrams which have been circulated, seriousdisturbances occurred on the 19th of April, and although forthe last few days conditions have become relatively quiet, thestrike which has &quot;been organized &quot;by the Arah leaders has &quot;becomeintensified and, as will he seen from the High Commissionerstelegram No.  195 of the 8th of May, which has also already been circulated, Sir Arthur Wauchope anticipates that the longerthe present crisis continues the graver risk there is of more widespread disturbances,  and he has felt it necessary to askfor certain reinforcements to he sent to Palestine from Egypt                                                         and
     and Iraq, at the earliest possible moment.   Steps have already-     been taken to comply with the High Commissioner&apos;s request.               I have now received a telegram No. 197 of the 8th of     May from Sir Arthur w*auchope, of which a copy is annexed to     this memorandum, from which it will he seen that there is now     very little prospect of the deputation leaving Palestine and     that the High Commissioner makes the considered recommendation     that the most helpful means now open to His Majesty&apos;s Government     of preventing the present disorder from spreading and increasing     in violence is for an immediate announcement to he made of the     appointment of a Royal Commission with wide terms of reference.     The High Commissioner contemplates that the terras of reference     should include not only questions relating to the Legislative     Councils the sale of lands and immigration, hut also the causes     of the disorders which have occurred and the process of those     disorders, with power to make recommendations for lessening     animosities and for establishing a feeling of lasting security     in Palestine.               In view of the serious situation which has developed     in Palestine and of the considerations put forward &quot;by     Sir Arthur Wauchope, I am strongly of opinion that his     recommendation for the immediate announcement of the appointment     of a Royal Commission should be approved.   The terms of     reference will clearly require very careful consideration,     having regard on the one hand to Arab demands and the continued     state of unrest in Palestine,  and on the other to the     uneasiness which will naturally he aroused in the minds of Jews     at the possible consequences of an enquiry to he  held by a     Royal Commission in present circumstances.    I propose to deal     with this aspect of the question when the matter  comes before     the Cabinet for discussion,,                                          (Intd.)  J.H.T.Colonial Office,    Downing Street,        11th May,  1936.
A N N E X.PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the High Commissioner for palestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies,Dated 8th May.  Received 5 p,rn0 8th May.IMMEDIATE.No. 197 Secret.          With reference to your telegram of 7th May, I assume that your statement to Lord Melchett contained nothing whichcould he represented as an undertaking that unless and untilArab deputation has visited London Ros^al Commission will not he set up.  There is no?/ very little prospect of deputationleaving Palestine as I informed you in ray telegram No. 185, andI understand that Council of Ten, in conference of representtatives of local committees have now decided to advocate non-payment of taxes after 15th May unless Jewish immigration isstopped by Government,  In my considered judgment the immediate announcement of the appointment of a Royal Commission, withwide terms of reference such as those recommended in mydespatch secret of the 29th April, is the most helpful meansnow open to us of preventing present disorder spreading and increasing in violence.  I am making this suggestion not asa mere expedient to deal with a temporary difficulty., hutbecause I consider a full enquiry into the serious situationwhich has arisen in Palestine by a body of the authority andstanding of a Royal Commission is now essential to the futurepeaceful administration of the country and development ofnational home.    I have no doubt that police and drasticmilitary action can hold in check major disorders but thiscourse would lead to an increase of permanent embitterment, andwould be constantly liable to recur in future.                        3.
