I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a further redraft of the despatch to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin, revised in accordance with Cabinet Conclusions(CP. 33 (36)) of the 4th May, 1936,                                                                   A. E.    May 5,  1936.                                                       Foreign Office,Sir,                                                        May   ,  1936.    YOUR Excellency  will be aware that His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom have for some time past had under the most careful considera-tion  the memoranda communicated to me by the late Herr von Hoesch on the7th March, 1936,  and.  by  Herr von Ribbentrop on the 24th  March  and the1st April,  1936, respecting the reoccupation of the demilitarised zone and thepeace proposals of the German Government.    2.  Such consideration was naturally indispensable in view of the importance which, as your Excellency is aware,  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government attach to theestablishment in Europe of a real and lasting peace based on  the recognition ofthe equality of rights and independence of every State, together with respect by every State for  the engagements  entered into by it.   It is  the desire of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to make every effort within their power  to co-operate inthe promotion of  the objective described by the  German Government in thememorandum of the 31st  March,  as &quot;the  great work&quot;  of securing European peace; and it is accordingly with this aim in view and in order  to open the wayto fruitful negotiation  that I address to you this despatch  and request  yourExcellency to seek an interview with the German Chancellor. You should prefaceyour remarks by a statement to this effect.    3.  Certain  of the German Governments proposals deal, as your Excellencyis aware, with temporary arrangements in the  demilitarised  zone pending thecompletion of the first stage of the general negotiations for  the peace of europe which were proposed by  the German Government.   On these temporary arrange-ments it  is not my purpose to comment in the present despatch,  though  yourExcellency  knows  that  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government regret that the  GermanGovernment have not  been able to make a more substantial contribution towardsthe re-establishment of the confidence which is such an essential preliminary to the wide negotiations which  they both  have in view.    4. In the course of  my interview with Herr von Ribbentrop on the 2nd April,I informed his Excellency that His Majesty&apos;s Government regard the proposalsfor the future in the German memorandum of the 31st March (that communicatedto me on the 1st April) as most important and as deserving of careful study.This study is now at an advanced stage; but His Majesty&apos;s Government find      8564B  [13131]
2 difficulty in carrying it further without discussing more closely with the German Government (as foreshadowed in the Geneva communique of the 10th April) a certain number of points in the three memoranda, particularly in those of the 24th  and 31st March.   His Majesty&apos;s Government feel  sure that the German Government will share their view that the greatest possible precision is desirable before general negotiations can open, in order that in  the future no misunder- standings may cloud the confident co-operation of the Powers of Europe, which it is the most earnest hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as they are sure.also of the German Government, that the proposed negotiations may advance.    5.   There are a number of passages in the  German memoranda of the 24th and 31st March which leave His  Majesty&apos;s Government in  some doubt as to the conception held by the German Government of the basis upon which the future settlement should be founded,    8   The first point on which it is desirable  to be clear is whether Germany regards  herself  as  now  in  a  position  to  conclude   &quot; genuine  treaties.&quot; There are passages in  the second sub-paragraph of paragraph 1 of the German Governments memorandum of the 24th  March, 1936, which seem to suggest that it is the view of the German Government that by their  action in  the Rhineland they  have established this  position.  On the other hand,  there are passages in paragraph 2 of the memorandum of the  24th March which might be capable of a different interpretation, which, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not themselves wish to draw.  It is, of course,  clear that negotiations for a treaty would be useless if one of the parties hereafter felt free  to deny its obligation on the ground  that that party was  not  at the  time  in  a  condition to conclude a binding treaty, and His Majesty&apos;s Government -would invite  a clear declaration from  the German Government to remove any uncertainty on this point.    7.  If  the argument  set  out in  paragraph  6 of  the  German Govern- ment&apos;s memorandum of the 31st March  is intended to be of general application, it might give rise to doubt as to the view which the German Government take of the continued maintenance in force of  the remaining  operative  clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, and, indeed, of any agreement which, might be said to have had its origin in  the provisions  of the  Treaty  of Versailles.   His Majesty&apos;s Government do not wish to enter into controversy as to the historical interpreta- tion of events set forth in that paragraph, and consequently they do not propose to state their views here.  But they must, of course, make it clear  that they arc unable to accept the views  put  forward  by the German Government  in the paragraph in question.    8.  There is in paragraph 4 of the memorandum of the 31st March a furthercause for uncertainty.   It is  stated in that paragraph that &quot; the German Government have received from the German People (&apos; Volk&apos;) a solemn general mandate to represent the Reich and the German Nation (&apos; Nation &apos;) to carry out a policy which  implies  the  preservation  under  all   circumstances  of  their freedom, their independence and  at  the same time their equality of status.&quot; A distinction  is apparently drawn between the  Reich and the German Nation. The question  is really whether Germany now considers that a point  has  been reached at which she can signify  that she recognises and intends in future to respect the existing territorial and political status of Europe,  except in so far as this might be subsequently modified by free negotiation and agreement.    9.  I turn now to other matters.  Sub-paragraph 13 of paragraph 22 of the memorandum  of the 31st March  refers to &quot; the conclusion of an Air Pact to supplement  and reinforce these (Western European) security  agreements.&quot;   In the spring of 1935 the German Government were understood to hold that the negotiation of an Air Pact should not be complicated by an attempt to accompany it by an agreement for  the  limitation  of  air forces.   Since  then  a somewhatcontradictory position seems to have arisen.   In  the Reichstag on the 21st May, 1935,  Herr Hitler mentioned the  possibility of an agreement for air limitation on the basis of parity between the great  Western Powers, provided, so we under- stood, that the development of the Soviet air force was not  such that revisionwould be necessary.  The Chancellors speech of.the 21st.May, 1935, was made after  the signature of the  Franco-Soviet  Treaty;  yet in December 1935  he
informed your Excellency that that Treaty had made air limitation impossible.A decision not  to attempt  to accompany a  Western  Air Pact  by a regionalagreement for limitation of air strengths would be very much regretted by HisMajesty&apos;s Government;  and  the  statement  in paragraph 2  of the Germanmemorandum that the German Government are impressed by the results achieved in the limited  sphere  of  the recent  agreement  respecting naval  armamentsencourages them to hope that the German Government will be able to fall- in withtheir views on this point.     10.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are gratified to see that, in sub-paragraphs 10and  14 of paragraph 22 of the memorandum  of  the 31st March,  the GermanGovernment propose the conclusion of non-aggression  pacts between Germany,on the one  hand, and  France,  Belgium and  possibly Flolland  on the  other.They note that the  German Government are  willing that these pacts should be accompanied by  treaties of guarantee.  The exact form  which these instrumentswill  assume must be a matter for detailed negotiation.     His Majesty&apos;s Government also note the proposal  in sub-paragraph  17 ofparagraph  22 for non-aggression pacts between  Germany and  the  States  on germany&apos;s south-eastern and north-eastern frontiers.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould venture to recall the general outline of such pacts  given to Sir John Simonby Baron von Neurath in Berlin on the 26th March, 1935. They would be glad toknow whether the German Government suggest that these  pacts should followgenerally that outline,  and whether they agree that these pacts also  may  be guaranteed by mutual assistance arrangements.     The announcement which the  German Government have been able to make ofGermany&apos;s readiness to re-enter the League  of  Nations permits  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to assume that no difficulty will  arise as regards the conformity ofthe proposed non-aggression pacts with the obligations of members of the Leagueof Nations,  and that the operation  of these pacts will take  place  within  the framework of the Covenant.     There are two further points,  to which attention should be drawn. The firstconcerns the meaning of the words &apos;&apos; the States on Germany&apos;s south-eastern and north-eastern frontiers.&quot;   His Majesty&apos;s Government  cannot  but feel that  thegeneral settlement would be very  greatly facilitated if  the  German Governmentcould see their way to interpret these words so as to cover at least  also the soviet union, Latvia and Estonia, as  well as the States actually contiguous to Germany.In this connexion His Majesty&apos;s Government would venture to recall that in their memorandum of  the 26th March, 1935, the  German Government  stated their readiness to conclude pacts  of non-aggression with  &apos;c the Powers interested in east European  questions.&quot;     The  second  is that of  non-interference  in  the  affairs  of other States,  as distinct from non-aggression  against them.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  recallwith satisfaction the Chancellors statement in the Reichstag on the 21st May,1935, that the German Government were &quot; ready at any  time  to  agree  to  aninternational arrangement which  will effectively prevent and render impossibleall attempts to interfere from, outside in the affairs of other States.&quot;     11.  In  sub-paragraph  19   of  paragraph  22  &quot;  Germany  proposes  theconstitution of an international court of arbitration which shall have competence inrespect of the observance of the  various  agreements concluded.&quot;  Presumably,these agreements are those mentioned in sub-paragraphs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and17 of paragraph 22.  It would be desirable to know generally the functions and constitution of the proposed court and the relation which the former would bearto the functions  of the Council of the League of Nations and of the PermanentCourt of International Justice.     In view  of  the  announcement of  Germany&apos;s  willingness  to  return  to  theLeague of Nations, the German Government will, no doubt, be willing to indicate their future attitude towards the Permanent  Court of International  Justice(particularly  in  relation  to the   Optional  Clause)  and towards  the  variousprovisions for arbitration, conciliation or judicial settlement contained in treaties,to which Germany is a party.  ...                      .    .       ...    .....     12.  When  your Excellency  sees the Chancellor,  I request  that you will discuss with him the points raised in this despatch and leave with him a&apos;, copy.Your Excellency should  explain that these are &quot;not exhaustive.   There are other.
matters which will have to be raised at a later date; and before the return ofGermany to the League of Nations comes under discussion, the German Govern -ment will no doubt think it desirable to give some definition of the phrase &quot; the separation of the  Covenant of the League of Nations from its basis in the Treatyof Versailles setting,&quot; which occurs  in sub-paragraph 18 of paragraph 22.  Atthe moment  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government prefer only to deal with  points theelucidation of which is essential prior to the opening of the general negotiations with, as stated above, they are sincerely desirous of promoting.
