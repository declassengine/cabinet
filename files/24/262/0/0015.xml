THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 125 (36).CABINET.QUESTIONS TO BE  ADDRESSED TO  THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT.    I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a re-draft of the despatch to His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Berlin, revised in accordance with Cabinet Conclusions  32 (36)of the 30th April, 1936.                                                                  A. E.    May 1, 1936.        Re-draft of Despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin.Sir,    YOUR  Excellency will be aware  that  His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom have for some time past had under the most careful considera-tion the memoranda communicated  to me by the  late Herr von Hoesch on the7th March,  1936,  and by  Herr von Ribbentrop  on the 24th  March  and the1st April, 1936, respecting the reoccupation of the demilitarised zone and thepeace  proposals of  the German Government.    2.  Such consideration was naturally indispensable in view of the importance which, as your Excellency is aware, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government attach to theestablishment in Europe of a real and lasting peace based  on  the recognition ofthe equality  of  rights and independence of every State, together with respect by every  State for the engagements entered into by it.  It is with this aim in view and in order to open the way to fruitful  negotiation that I address to you this despatch and request  your Excellency  to seek an interview  with the german chancellor.  You should preface your  remarks  by a statement  to this effect.    3.  Certain of the German Governments proposals deal, as your  Excellencyis  aware, with  temporary arrangements in the  demilitarised  zone pending thecompletion of the first stage of the general negotiations for the peace of europe which were proposed by the German Government.   On these temporary arrange-ments it is not my purpose to comment  in  the present despatch, though yourExcellency  knows  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government regret  that the  GermanGovernment  have not been able to make a more substantial  contribution towardsthe re-establishment of the confidence which is such  an essential  preliminary to the wide negotiations which they have in view.    4.  In the course of my interview with Herr von Ribbentrop on the 2nd April,I informed his  Excellency that His  Majesty&apos;s Government  regard the proposalsfor the future in the German memorandum of the 31st March (that communicatedto me on the 1st April) as most important and as deserving of careful study.This study is  now at an  advanced  stage; but His Majesty&apos;s Government find difficulty in carrying it further without  discussing  more closely with the GermanGovernment  (as foreshadowed in the Geneva communique  of  the 10th April) acertain number of  points in the three memoranda, particularly in those of the24th and 31st March.   His Majesty&apos;s Government feel sure that the  German        8564A   [13131]
 Government will share their view that the greatest possible precision is desirable before any general negotiations can open, in order that in the future no misunder- standings may cloud the confident co-operation of the Powers of Europe, which it is the most earnest hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as they are sure also of the German Government, that the proposed negotiations may advance.     5.  There are a number of passages in  the  German memoranda of the 24th and 31st  March which leave  His Majesty&apos;s Government  in  some doubt as to the conception held by the German Government of the basis upon which the future settlement should be founded,     6.  The  first point on which it is desirable  to be clear is whether Germany now regards herself as possessed of that &quot; complete equality &quot;  which, in her own words, is the condition under which alone she can conclude &quot; genuine treaties.&quot; There are passages in the second sub-paragraph of paragraph 1 of the German Government&apos;s memorandum of  the 24th March, 1936, which seem to suggest that it is the view of the German Government that by their action in  the Rhineland they have  fulfilled this condition.   On the other hand,  there are passages in paragraph 2 of the memorandum of the 24th. March which might be capable of a different interpretation.   These latter passages may  be  held to suggest thatGermany&apos;s &quot; complete equality  &quot; has, in the view of the German Government, notyet been achieved.&apos; His majesty&apos;s Government would not themselves wish to draw any such conclusion, but they would be glad  to have a clear declaration from the German Government on this point, in order to dissipate any uncertainty which may remain.    : 7.  If the  argument  set  out in  paragraph  6 of  the  German Govern-menfs memorandum of the 31st March is intended to be of general application, it might give rise to doubt as to the view which the German Government  take ofthe continued maintenance in  force of the  remaining operative  clauses  of the Treaty of  Versailles, and, indeed, of any agreement which might be said  to havehad its origin in the provisions of  the Treaty  of  Versailles.    His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not wish to enter into controversy as to the historical interpreta-tion of events set forth in that  paragraph, and consequently they do not proposeto state their views here.  But  they must, of course,  make it clear that they areunable  to  accept the views put forward by the German Government  in the paragraph in question.    8.  There is in paragraph 4 of the memorandum of the 31st March a  furthercause for  uncertainty.   It is  stated  in that  paragraph that  &quot;the GermanGovernment have received from the  German People (&apos; Volk &apos;) a solemn  generalmandate to represent the Reich and the German  nation (nation) &quot; to carry out apolicy  which implies  the  preservation  under  all  circumstances  of  &apos;&apos; their freedom, their independence and  at  the same time their equalitj^ of status.&quot;A distinction is apparently drawn between  the  Reich and the German  nation.    9.  The question is really whether Germany now considers that a point hasbeen reached  at which she can signify that she recognises  unreservedly andintends in future to respect the existing territorial and political status of Europe.    10.  I turn now to other matters.  Sub-paragraph 13 of paragraph 22 of thememorandum  of the 31st March refers to &quot; the conclusion of an Air Pact to supplement and  reinforce these (Western European) security  agreements.&quot;   Inthe spring of 1935 the German Government was understood to  hold that the negotiation of an Air Pact should not be complicated by an attempt to accompanyit by an agreement  for the limitation of air forces.   Since  then  a somewhatcontradictory position seems to have arisen.   In  the Reichstag on the 21st May,1935, Herr Hitler mentioned the possibility of an agreement  for air  limitation on the basis of parity between the great Western Powers, provided, so we  under-stood, that the development of the Soviet air force  was not  such that revisionwould be necessary.  The  Chancellor&apos;s speech of the 21st  May, 1935,  was made after the  signature  of the Franco-Soviet  Treaty;  yet in December 1935  he informed your Excellency that  that Treaty had  made air  limitation impossible.A decision not  to attempt to  accompany a Western  Air Pact  by- a regionalagreement  for limitation of air strengths would be very much regretted  by His
Majesty&apos;s  Government;  and  the  statement  in paragraph 2  of the Germanmemorandum that the German Government are impressed by the results achieved in the limited sphere  of  the recent  agreement  respecting naval  armamentsencourages them to hope that the German Government will be able to fall in withtheir views on this point.    11.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are gratified to see that, in sub-paragraphs 10and 14 of  paragraph 22 of the memorandum  of  the 31st March, the GermanGovernment propose the conclusion of non-aggression pacts between Germany,on the one hand, and  France,  Belgium and  possibly Holland  on the  other.They  note  that the  German Government are  willing that these pacts should be accompanied by treaties of guarantee.  The exact form which these instrumentswill assume must be a matter for detailed negotiation.    His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  also note the proposal in  sub-paragraph 17 ofparagraph 22  for non-aggression pacts between  Germany and  the States  on germany&apos;s south-eastern and north-eastern frontiers.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould venture to recall the general outline of such pacts given to Sir John Simonby Baron von Neurath in Berlin on the 26th March, 1935.  They would be glad toknow  whether the German Government suggest that these pacts should followgenerally that  outline,  and whether they  agree  that  these pacts also  may  be guaranteed by mutual assistance arrangements.    The  announcement which the German Government have been able to make ofGermany&apos;s readiness to re-enter the League  of Nations  permits  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to  assume that  no difficulty will  arise as regards the conformity ofthe proposed non-aggression pacts with the  obligations of  members of the Leagueof Nations, and that the operation of  these pacts will  take  place  within the framework of the Covenant.    There are two further points to which  attention should be  drawn.  The firstconcerns  the meaning of the words &quot; the States on Germany&apos;s south-eastern and north-eastern frontiers.&quot;   His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot  but feel that thewhole settlement  would be very greatly facilitated if  the  German Governmentcould see their way to interpret these words so as to cover at least  also the soviet union, Latvia and Estonia, as  well as the States actually contiguous to Germany.In this connexion His Majesty&apos;s Government would venture to recall that in their memorandum of  the 26th March, 1935, the  German  Government stated  their readiness to conclude pacts  of non-aggression with  &quot; the  Powers interested in east  European questions.&quot;    The  second is  that  of  non-interference  in the  affairs of  other  States,  as distinct  from non-aggression  against them.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government recallwith satisfaction the Chancellor&apos;s statement  in the Reichstag  on the 21st  May,1935,  that the  German  Government were  &quot; ready at  any time to agree to  aninternational arrangement which will effectively prevent and render impossibleall attempts to interfere from outside in  the affairs of other States.&quot;    12.  His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the German Government willthink it  desirable to give some early definition of the phrase &apos;&apos; the separation ofthe Covenant of the League of Nations from its basis in the Treaty of Versaillessetting,&quot; which occurs in sub-paragraph  18 of paragraph 22.    13.  In  sub-paragraph  19  of paragraph  22  &quot;Germany  proposes  theconstitution of an international court of arbitration which shall have competence inrespect of  the observance of the various agreements concluded.&quot;  Presumably,these agreements are those mentioned in sub-paragraphs 9,  10, 11, 12, 13,  14 and17 of  paragraph 22.  It would be desirable to know generally the functions and constitution of the proposed court and the relation which the former  Avould bearto the functions of the Council of  the League of Nations and of the  PermanentCourt of International Justice.    In view of the announcement of Germany&apos;s  willingness  to return  to theLeague of Nations, the German Government will, no doubt, be willing to indicate their  future attitude towards the Permanent  Court of  International  Justice(particularly in  relation  to the  Optional Clause)  and  towards the  variousprovisions for arbitration, conciliation or judicial settlement contained in treatiesto which  Germany is a party.
    14.  When  your Excellency  sees the  Chancellor, I  request  that  you will discuss with him the points raised in this  despatch and leave with  him a copy.Your  Excellency should explain that these  are not exhaustive.   There are othermatters which will  have  to be raised at a later date, but at  the moment HisMajesty&apos;s Government prefer only to deal with points  the elucidation of which isessential prior to the opening of these general negotiations which, as stated above,they are sincerely desirous of promoting.
