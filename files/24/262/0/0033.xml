THE COAL MINES BILL, 1956.                   REPORT. 1.      At their Meeting on 20th Mays  1936,  (Cahinet  38  (36) Conclusion l)  the Cahinet  had under consideration;,  as a matter of urgencys the present position in  regard to the Coal Mines Bill, and agreed that the Bill should he  referred to  the Committee for examination of the whole  situations particularly in its political aspectss  in consultation  with the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Treasurys with a  view to a report to the Cahinet. 2.      In the  course of his speech  in the House of Commons on the Second Reading of the  Bill on 18th  Mays the Prime Minister said:-         &quot;Clearlys it would he impossible to get         the Second Reading of this  Bill tonight.         I am also clear that  it  would only  he         fairs  in all the circumstancess that         before the House is  ashed to vote on the         Second Reading of  the Bill  we should have         another day&apos;s  Debates  that  a reasonable         time should elapse  before the day for  that         Debate is selected, and that before  that         day comes the  Government  should issue  a         White  Paper explanatory  of  the  suggested         modifications  to be  introduced  in Committee         by the President of  the  Board of Trade  and         the Secretary  for Mines  in  the  event of the         Bill receiving a Second Reading.&quot;                               Hansard?

                                                        IBS5&apos;,     We have accordingly considered what elate should hefixed for the resumption of the adjourned Debate on theSecond Reading,4.     We are info^ied by the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury that on the assumption that Parliament will be pro-rogued foi* the Sum...er Recess on Friday? 31st July, theHouse of Coiamons Time Table is alreaoy overloaded to theextent of fxve daysj on rlie most favourable estimate.   Heanticipates that if an attempt is made to proce d with theBill it will meet with the most strenuous opposition, bothon the floor of the House and in Standing Committee.   Inhis view the Committee stage of the Bill would be  unlikely tobe concluded much before the end of July ana he can see no prospect of the Bill passing into law before the Recess.5.     The Lord Chancellor has-warned us that there will beat least as much opposition to the Bill in the House of Lordsas in the House of Commons.   The House of Lords wouldcertainly  refuse to pass the Bill if it only reached them afew days before the Recess.6.     We have examined the possibility of dividing the Bill and of proceeding before the Recess only with the extensionof Part I of the Act of 1950.   We are satisfied, however,that the objections to this course outweigh any possible advantages.7,     In these circumstances we are convinced that no useful purpose would, be served by any attempt to proceed with theBill before the Summer Recess.8.     The Bill, duly amended on the lines indicated by thePresident of the Board of Trade in the Debate on SecondReading, should therefore be re-introduced in the autumn,
        and its passage into law should then he made a question of        confidence.  It will he imperative, before the Second        Reading of the new Bill in the autumn, that every effort        should he made to ensure adequate publicity and support for        the Government&apos;s proposals, both inside and outside        Parliament.        9.     In view of the Debate on 18th May&quot; 3 it is urgently        necessary that the Government&apos;s intentions regarding the        Bill should he announced before the Yi/hitsuntide Recess, and        we attach, for the approval of the Cabinet, the draft of a        statement on the subject which might he incorporated in        the Prime Minister&apos;s announcement regarding Parliamentary        business after Whitsuntide,        10o    If the Cabinet accept our suggestions there will,        of course, he no necessity for the publication of a        White Paper,        11.    Our conclusions and recommendations may he suinrnarised        as follows              (l)  No useful purpose would he served by                     any attempt to proceed with the present                     Coal Mines Bill before the Summer Recess.              (2)  A Coal Mines Bill,  embodying the modi-                     fications indicated by the President                     of the Board of Trade in the Debate on                     Second Reading,  should be introduced in                     the autumn and its passage into law                     should then be made a matter of confidence.              (3)  A statement of the Government^ intentions                     on the lines of the attached draft should                     be made in the House of Commons before the                     Whitsuntide Recess,                          Signed on behalf of the Committee                                   WALTER RUNCIMAN,                                            Chairman.. of Trade,36th May,  1936.
                 DRAFT STATSMiSET.     It will be for-  the  convenience  of  the House  if make a statement as  to the Government&apos;s intentions in regardto the Goal Mines Bill.     The Government hold by the principles of the Bill, which forms an integral part of the measures designed to improve the condition of the coal industry;  they have, however,decided that it must he postponed until the Autumn.When the house reassembles after Whitsuntide there will only he about 8 Parliamentary weeks before the beginningof August.   There is still a great deal of essentialGovernment business  to be got through before the recess and from a careful examination of the time-table, it isclear that sufficient time is not now available to pass the Bill through all its stages in this House in time toallow reasonable discussion of the measure in anotherJO 1 G.C S *     The Government will make use of the interval to prepare a Bill,  which will incorporate the changes announced by thePresident of the Boe.ru of Trade when moving the SecondReading on Monday,  18th May.    Consequently it will not benecessary to present a White Paper.     The Government will ask the House to proceed with thenew Bill as soon as possible  after the Summer Recess.     If any inconvenience or  uncertainty is likely to  be created by this brief postponement,  I trust that the  termsof my announcement  will be sufficient to dissipate them.
