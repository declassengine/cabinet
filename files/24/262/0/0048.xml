COPY NO..  158  (56)                             C A B  I N E T.           THE CATTLE SUBSIDY PROPOSALS AND THE MEAT NEGOTIATIONS.            Memorandum by the President of the Board  of Trade.           The Cattle Subsidy Committee (CP. 152(36)) have      expressed the opinion that              &quot;in  the event of a collapse of prices due to,  e.g.              a meat war, we should reserve the liberty of action              vis-a-vis Argentina and the Dominions so as to              enable us to take whatever measures may then be              thought best to safeguard the home producer,  for              example by prohibition or restriction of import,              excess levies, etc.&quot;           This proposal raises a very difficult question from the      point of view of the negotiations with the Dominions and      Argentina.   We have naturally always contemplated that in the      event of a breakdown of the International Meat Conference the      United Kingdom Government would be free to take whatever      measures were necessary to safeguard the situation.   We have,      however, recognised that it was desirable to avoid making any      express provision to this effect on two grounds, namely:            (l)  that it would weaken the responsibility of the                 International Meat Conference and possibly                 encourage one party or the other to aim at  a                 breakdown,  and            (2)  that it would inevitably lead to demands both from                 the Dominions and from Argentina for assurances                 as to the treatment they would receive in the                 event of quantitative regulation being reimposed.           I should have preferred therefore to leave it to be      understood that in the last resort the United Kingdom      Government would have  to take charge, but not to say so too      explicitly,,           I do  not think we can look for a solution in the direction      of excess  duties or levies.    Neither the Dominions  nor      Argentina  could now be induced tovaccopt such an arrangement      and the difficulty of  defining the precise circumstances in      which such a levy would be imposed appears to me to  bo      insuperable.
s&amp;,-*     V/e have then to consider (1) whether it is possible to define the c i r euros t anc e g in rhich quantitative regulation nigh, thave to be x*e imposed, and. (2) on v/hat principles it should bebased.     (1)  There arc tv/o cases to be considered:-      (a)   agreement  on  the  Meat  Conference which nevertheless            results  in  art over-supply  of  the market and a -            collapse of prices.    Since the United. Kingdom            producer will bo represented  on the  Conference and            since  the meekness of  the  market due to an excess of            imports  will certainly first  show  itself in a fall            of  the prices of imported  meat, I  do not think we            need legislate  for this  contingency.      (b)   a break  auay  from the  Conference on  the part of one            or  more  of  the  supplying countries.    In that event            I fear there would be  nothing for  it but to            reimpose quantitative  regulation,  and all the            troubles with which  we are already only too            familiar would  be revived.      (2)  After a  good,  deal of consideration I remain of theopinion that v/e should,  do everything v/e can to avoid committing ourselves  as to the  principles on  v/hich such regulation would beadm in i s t er e d.      In the case of  Argentina, I think the&apos;only  thing to do isto provide that if we resume regulation of imports  v/e will  onlydo so after due consultation and. she will be at  liberty ifdissatisfied to terminate the agreement at short  notice.      In the case of  the Dominions  no such simple  solution seems possible.    we might be faced, by the necessity of giving up theproposed system by v/hich the Dominions will receive  a permanentpreference of i&apos;jrd. a  lb. (without guarantees as to quantities)and of returning once more  to the  Ottav/a undertaking to  give  theDominions an expanding share of  imports into the  United Kingdom.The interpretation of this latter  undertaking  Mas already given rise to serious difficulty,  and. the  substitution  for  it  of  asystem of levies with preference to  the Dominions is  one  ofthe objects of the present negotiations.
     It seems to me therefore that it would be fatal to commit ourselves to any policy in the event of the Conference brealcindown.   We want all parties alike to believe that it is intheir interests to come to a reasonable and businesslikearrangement.   I should tell the Dominions  in one form or another that we envisage a breakdown of the Conference as atemporary emergency to be dealt with at our discretion by a compulsory stabilisation of the status quo as regards eithertotal supplies or the proportions of the respective countries.This would be pending a review of the whole situation inconsultation with all the parties.   We could give no positiveundertaking as to the nature of the further steps which itmight be found necessary to take in the event of a settlement by negotiation proving to be impracticable.  vWhat we should tto do would be what the Conference ought to have done itself,but to say here and now what that would be is impossible.                                W.R.Board of Trade,    8th June, 1936.
