/(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP        284    HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;b  GOVERNMENT)Il6l(36)             CABINET.    Railway Freight Rebates Scheme.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.                                       COPY NO,     1.     In July,  1935,  I  circulated  a memorandum CP. 139(35)  regarding the possible  effect  upon the Railway Freight  Rebates  Scheme  of certain  decisions  as  to the valuation for rating purposes of the Southern  and London  and North Eastern Railways.   By these  decisions&quot; the net annual value  of  the  Southern Railway was reduced from  1,840,000  to   1,077,000 and that  of  the  London and North Eastern Railway from  2,600,000  to nil.     2.     As  a result of  an  appeal  to  the  House of Lords and further proceedings before  the  Railway and Canal Commission, the  valuation of the Southern  Railway  for the quinquennium  1931-1936 is finally fixed  by the Courts at the figure of  1,077,000  representing  a reduction  of about 41  per  cent,  from the amount on which  that railway was actually  assessed during  the period, and as the Company have  provisionally  contributed  to the Railway  Freight Rebates Fund  upon the basis  of  the  old  assessments,  there is a debt  due from  the Fund  to  the Company  of approximately  1,100,000.     3.     The nil assessment of the  London and North Eastern Railway  is  still  open to challenge by  the  local authorities and  the valuations  of the other Companies have yet to  be  determined.   I understand that  negotiations are in  progress between the Railway Companies  and the  local authorities with a view to arriving at  some mutually agreed
                                                  9tt                                                  M U figures to represent the  assessments  of  the  railways during the past quinquennium and  possibly  the new assessments to operate for five  years  from  the  1st April,  1938. Pending the result  of these  negotiations  any attempt to forecast the position  of  the Rebates  Fund is  speculative, but if  it be assumed that, in the final  result the  amount of the  companies&apos; rate  relief payable into the Fund  will approximate to one half the  amount  (about SA millions) actually paid during each  of the past five years, the Fund will be in debt to the  extent of something like   10 millions,  the equivalent,  upon  the  same  assumption,  of  the total income of the  Fund for the next five years.     4.     The Railway Rates  Tribunal must review the Rebates Scheme  in November  of each year and fix  the  rates of rebates for the ensuing 12 months.   Their  last  review (November 1955) opened on the  day on which the hearing of  the  ap )eal in the  southern Railway case was begun by the House  of Lords and  in the face of the uncertainty which thus  existed, the Tribunal decided to continue the rebates for a  further year at the rates previously in force.   Thus the Fund  is continuing to pay out amounts of about  75,000 a week by way of  rebates  and is increasing its indebtedness.   It is difficult  to  justify the continued distribution from the Fund to traders  of moneys which on the above assumptions will be  required  to meet  the liability of the Fund to the Railway Companies and it is essential to decide without delay whether the rebates  now allowed  to the  selected coal, iron and steel and agricultural  traffics under the Scheme are to  cease altogether for a term  of  years,  and  if  not,what steps should be  taken to enable them to  be  continued at reduced rates.
                 - 3  -                                &amp;Q&amp;     5.     If the Government  take no  action and  leave  the existing scheme  to operate in  accordance with the  Statute the  Railway  Rates Tribunal will consider the situation at the  review in November next, and it  would seem  that they will be bound,  as so.On as the amount of the repayments  due to the Companies  has been ascertained, to determine that  rebates must  cease.    I  understand that the  President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Mines would regard the consequences of  such a course  as extremely serious, particularly to  the coal export trade.   They consider - therefore  that the complete cessation of the rebates should if possible  be avoided arid in  this view the Minister of Agriculture  concurs.    6.     I  have  considered with the other Departments what steps could  be taken to prevent the  complete cessation of rebates.   As a  preliminary step, legislation would be necessary  on the  lines indicated in ray memorandum  of July last, to enable  the repayment  to the Railway Companies of their past overpayments to the Rebates Fund to be  spread over an  extended period without exposing the Companies to an obligation to pay half of the  &quot;deficiency&quot;  in the Fund out of their own pockets.   Their  minimum liability would be half the amount  of any rebates allowed and  on a literal construction of  the scheme it  is possible that  they would beheld liable  to make good half  the debit balance carried forward from year to year until it  was completely extinguished bo long as any such consequences were involved,  it  must be assumed that the Tribunal would not  feel able to allow rebates and amendment of the existing  scheme  in this particular seems an essential part of any solution.    The title  of  a Billwith this object was  included in Group D(Bills which had  notyet received Cabinet  approval,  but might be  required in
 certain eventualities)  of the list  of  Bills  in  the Legislative Programme  for 19 55/56 approved by the Home affairs Committee  on the  23th November,  1935.     7.     If repayment  of the debt  to  the Railway Companies were  spread by  an  arrangement under which the Companies made a  loan  to  the Rebates Fund of the amount of  the debt for a substantial period - eay  even as much  as 15  years and at a low rate of interest -  the balance  available for&apos; rebates, after providing for interest  and repayment, would be reduced to  something like   1^ million a year,  compared with nearly  4  millions  during the  past five years.   An endeavour could be  made  to  induce  the Companies to  forego interest on their advance  and  even to  make  some  further  contribution towards the maintenance  of the  rebates on the  ground that they have been and will be assisted  to  maintain  their traffics. I think  they will  generally be anxious to save the scheme from complete shipwreck ana they are certainly desirous of being relieved  of  any obligation to bear any part of deficiencies arising in the Fund, quite apart from its present  crisis.    At the  same  time,  there are obvious difficulties in urging  them in their present financial position, to find  money to assist industries, some of which - e.g. iron and steel  - may be  regarded  as relatively prosperou    8.    While  the  steps  indicated in the two preceding paragraphs would save the scheme from  total eclipse,  a most drastic reduction  in the rates of rebates would  still benecessary and to obviate the effect  of this on those trafficswhich are in greatest need of the rebates some  contraction  of the list of selected traffics might  be effected.   Under the scheme of the Local Government Act,  1929, the selected traffics were divided into three groups (l)  agricultural traffics to which 20 per cent, of the amount  available  was
 allocated;  (s) coal for export and for iron or steel works to., which was allocated 70 per cent;  and (o) certain other traffics - mainly materials of the iron and steel industry and pit props,  which received 10 per cent.    The Departments concerned consider that there is a. case for concentrating for a period of years the whole, or nearly  the whole,  of the 80 per cent, of the rebates,  v/hich at  present goes to  coal and  iron or steel traffics, upon coal  for export. The  value of the rebates  at present allowed on coal  and other materials for iron  or steel works is  about  1  million a  year.     It would probably  also be desirable that  the remaining SO per cent  should  be  concentrated  on manures,  milk and  livestock to the  exclusion  of potatoes  and  a miscellaneous list  of  feeding stuffs.           On the assumption that  repayment  of the  debt of the Fund  is  spread  over 15 years  without liability for interest  and that the  assessment  of the railways is  finally fixed  at  about  half the present  level,  export coal is then estimated on the present volume  of traffic  to get  a  rebate of about  5d. per ton compared with the  existing  rebate of 8d. per ton and with 3d. per ton  if the rebates  are  spread over the existing list of selected traffics.   The redviced list of agricultural traffics would share a  sum of about  860,000 as compared with  730,000 now assigned to all the scheduled agricultural traffics.    9.    The most practicable means of preserving therebate scheme are, therefore    (a)  by amending legislation to relieve  the Railway          Companies of their obligation to bear half  of          deficiencies arising in the Fund and to ask          them to agree to accept repayment  over a term          of years without interest;
    (b)   also by  amending  legislation to concentrate          the reduced  sum  available for rebates upon          a narrower range of  traffics for a period of          years and to this end  to negotiate with  the          interests concerned  as soon as  the position          in regard to the valuations is  sufficiently          definite.    10.    In the  absence of a  successful  and earlyconclusion of the negotiations between the local authoritiesand the  Railway Companies  as to  the valuations  there maybe difficulty in pursuing with the  representative organisations interested in the  selected  traffics  proposalsfor a concentration of the rebates.   I appreciate the prejudice which might  result,  either  to the  localauthorities or to the  railway  companies,  if  it  were thoughtthat the Government had come to  any conclusion  as  to whatthe result of their negotiations was  likely  to  be, but,  ifthe risk of a complete breakdown of the rebate  scheme atthe end of the year,  or alternatively a further large increase of the indebtedness of an  already bankrupt fund,is to be avoided, a decision in  principle as  to the line ofsolution should not be delayed,  and negotiations with theRailway  Companies and  those interested in the selectedtraffics should be opened  at a sufficiently  early  date to permit of the  necessary legislation being drafted and      -introduced before the  next review of rebates takes place.
