MjM;:     1.    At their Meeting on May 6th, 1936, (Cabinet 34 (36)     Conclusion 8), the Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum     by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 126 (36))     dealing with certain difficulties, connected with the insertion     of a time limit, which had arisen during the&apos; Anglo-Egyptian  Treaty     negotiations.   The Cabinet agreed to appoint a Committee     composed as follows               The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,               The Chancellor of. the Exchequer,               The ford Chancellor,               The None Secretary,               The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,               The Minister of Health,     &quot;to examine the Foreign Office proposals;!  to put this eompli-     cated matter in the simplest possible language %  and to make     recommendations&quot;,     3.    The Cabinet Committee have held one Meeting, at which they     have examined the forms of provision for the situation with     which His Majesty&apos;s Government is confronted on the basis of a     Memorandum by the Home Secretary, which is attached to the     present Report as Appendix I.   It will be  seen from the Minutes     of the Meeting, which are attached as Appendixjll, that the     whole question was exhaustively discussed and that as a result     the following recommendations were made:-
 (I)  Having regard, inter alia to the grave     objections,  &quot;both from the point of view     of the Dominions and of public opinion     at home,  there would, he the     greatest  difficulty in persuading     Parliament to accept any provisions in     the Treaty which would, at the end of     a fixed period, invest the Council of     the League of Nations or some outside     hody,  with the power to decide the     number of troops which His Maje sty&apos;s     Government should maintain in the Canal     zone in order to render our Imperial     communications safe, in the event of     Egypt  and the United. Kingdom being     tuiabIe to agree .(ii)  Of the three forms of provision which we     have considered, Form B appeared to be the     only acceptable one.   From the point of     view of British interests it probably represents     the irreducible minimum.   The objects     in view can best be attained by adopting     Clause 9  of the Annex to CP. 126 (36)     and also  the first part of Clause 16 of     that annex down to the words &quot;they then     exist&quot;.   The Clauses would accordingly     read as follows%-     Clause 9.         &quot;His  Majesty the King of Egypt authorises          His  Britannic Majesty to maintain upon          Egyptian territory, in localities in the-          vicinity of the Canal, such forces as His          Britannic Majesty considers necessary to          ensure the protection of this artery of          communication.   The present of these          forces shall not constitute in any manner          an occupation, and will in no say prejudice          the  sovereign rights of Egypt.    In view of&apos;          the  position of His Britannic Majesty in          relation to the Suez Canal&quot;, His Majesty          the  King of Egypt recognises that His          Bri t aimic Majesty may, through the          Commanders of these Forces, take all steps          necessary for the maintenance of the          security of, and of Mt&quot;he freedom of&apos;          navip;ation in, the said Canal.          The  detailed arrangements for carrying          into effect the provisions of this Article          are  contained, in the Annex hereto.&quot;

A draft telegram to the High Commissioner in Egypt,embodying our recommendations, has been prepared, for theconsideration of the Cabinet and is circulated separatelyunder cover of CP. 131 (36).Signed on behalf of the CommitteeANTHONY EDENChairman.8th May,  1936.Clause 16.    &quot;At any time after the expiration of a     period, of twenty years from the coming     into force of the treaty, the high     contracting parties will, at the request     of either of them, enter into negotia-     tions with a view to such revision of     its terms by agreement between them as     may be appropriate in the circumstances     as they then exist.&quot;
APPENDIX . I,.E T.G A BN E T..ANGLO-EGYPTIAN CONVERSATIOIONSCOMMITTEE.ALTERNATIVES  POP. THE EGYPTIAN TREATY.Notejjby; the HomeSecretary.     Apart from minor differences  in expression,  the  alternative forms which the provision ahout the  Suez  Canal  might  take  may &quot;beclassified as below.    In each case, I  have added the Comment to     The whole Treaty might be expressed to be made for 20 years with a provision that the Parties would enter upon negotiation of a new Treaty, say two years before its termination.    Then the suez Canal clause would contain no reference to the League ofNations as the authority 20 years later to decide anything aboutthe Suez Canal if the negotiations for a new Treaty failed.     Comments.       (l) This has the advantage of avoiding the parliamentary     obstacle which will arise if we attempt a Treaty which     brings in the League to decide anything about our future     position on the Suez Canal.       (2) The Foreign Office consider that there will be no     difficulty in getting Egypt to accept the proposal, so     long as Britain&apos;s rights during the 20 years are expressed     as in the proposed parac 9.   (2) Would such a Treaty be taken to imply that Britain5srights terminate after 20 years?   This is the main anxietyexpressed in the Foreign Office Paper (CP.  126 (36)) which,on this ground,  considers that Form A is really less favourable to His Majesty&apos;s Government than  the clause itrecommends (Form C).which the form might give rise.Form A.BUT
     Though still keeping to the idea of a Treaty expressed tobe made for 20 years,  it  is suggested that the difficulty A(3)above might be got over if the Treaty contained a preamble orother appropriate provision by which Egypt recognised that thespecial rights of H.M.G.  in relation to the Suez Canal existedwithout time limit and that the 20 years provision on thissubject should be as  to the mode in which these rights would byagreement he exercised.     Comment s o        (1)  While it  is certainly possible to draft a Treaty which     contains a recognition of Britan&apos;s perpetual right although     the Treaty itself only lasts for 20 years,  would Egypt     accept  it?        (2)  The previous  abortive drafts have  contained a     provision  for reference to the League of  nations after     20 years of the  Question of British Forces  on the Canal,     and it  is  therefore  very improbable that  Lgypt would give     an acknowledgement of our rights in perpetuity.            For example,  Article 9 of the draft  Treaty of 1930     contained  the following paragraphs-            &apos;&apos;It is understood tnat at the end  of the  period of     20 years specified in Article 14 of the question whether     trie presence of British forces is  no longer necessary     owing to the fact  that the Egyptian army  is in a position     to ensure  by its  own resources the  liberty  and entire     security of navigation on the Canal may,  if there has been     any difference between the High Contracting parties,  be     submitted  for settlement to the League of Nations.&quot;     Indeed,  Article 14 of the  1930 draft gave an appeal  to the     League  of  Nations  after 20 years if either  Party called     for revision of any  term of the Treaty.         -        (3)  While,  therefore, Form B might  be  the  most  satis-     factory of all from  the  point  of view  of  British interests     and parliamentary  discussion,  it seems to be  difficult  of     attainment.    yet  the  Chiefs  of  Staff have  throughout     insisted that  H.M..G. * s  exclusive responsibility  for the     security of  the Suez  Canal  was  and  would  always  remain  of     vital interest.
E i^h..Ph,.     This contemplates a Treaty in perpetuity with clauses ahoutthe  Sues Canal as in the annexe to CP.  126(56).     Comments^.        (l)  The last sentence of Article 16 provides that in     case the Parties cannot agree on the revised terms to he     settled after 20 years, the difference shall he suhir.permitted     to  the  Council of the League of Nations.    The difficulty     of  getting such a clause through Parliament is a serious     obstacle,  apart altogether from the question whether we     are justified in putting a vital British interest in the     hands of a Council where we should have no vote.        (2)  The language of the proposed clauses  is obscure and     intentionally obscure.    Indeed,  CP. 125(36)  states that     the Egyptians would not accept a text which set forth, what     Article 9  is intended to cover if the language was so clear     that its effect would at once be apparent to  everybody.        (3)  But even if the  obscurity of the language helps     Egyptian assent,  would not the assent of  our  own Parliament     only be obtained by malting the real effect of the thing     quite clear?        (l)  It  may be doubted whether the last sentence&apos;in the     proposed Article 16 does carry out  the purpose explained in     CP. 126(35) that,  if the Council fails to agree our rights     under Article 9 would,  in view of the language in Article 9,     go  on.    If the two Parties agree upon defined terms for     20  years and provide that if the revision of  these terms     is  not  agreed between them at the end. of  that period, the     difference will be submitted to an  arbitrator,  what is the     ground  for saying that the old terms will continue to bind     both sides after 20 years are up if the arbitrator is     unable  or  unwilling to decide?   At any rate  the point is  -   obscure,  an d wh he this obscurity might help Egypt  to qgiee  it would
    have to  he cleared  up  in  the British Parliament.        (5)  The phrase  &quot;the position  of His Britannic Majesty in    relation to the  Suez Canal&quot; would also need parliamentary    exposition.   CP.  126(36) explains that  the reference is to    Article  9  of&quot; the Suez  Canal Convention of 1888o   That    Article  is as follows.j-            &quot;The Egyptian Government  shall3 within the limits of      its powers resulting from the  Firmanss and under the      conditions provided for in the present Treaty, take the      necessary measures for insuring the execution of the      said  Treaty,            In case the Egyptian Government should not have      sufficient means at its disposals it shall call upon the      Imperial Ottoman Government9 which shall take the      necessary measures to respond  to such appeal;  shall      give notice thereof to the Signatory Powers of the      Declaration of London or the 17th iViaroh5 1885?  and shail?      if necessary9 concert with them on the subject.            The provisions of Articles iv, Vs VII s and VIII shall      not interfere with the measures which shall he taken in      virtue of the present Article,.11        I understand that the argument is that since the Treaty   of Versailles makes His Britannic  Majesty successor of Turkey   in-this Article9 the position of His Britannic Majesty in   relation to the Suez Canal is  that  of its permanent protector.   But  does not Article 9 only give to Turkeys  and therefore   to His Majesty&apos;s Government the right  to take the necessary   measures if appealed to &quot;by Egypt on the ground that  Egypt   has  not sufficient  means at its disposal to do what  is   necessary?        As against  all these  Comments and inherent difficultie%it is contended that our present  position in Egypt is juridicallyinsecure, and that  unless  we  make  the best bargain that  is opento usj  we shall he worse off  through  having made  no bargain atall.   Cert airily 3  the  position will not he improved by attempting to make a bargain  and  then failing to  secure agreement.
     The above is not intended to do anything more thananalyse as clearly as I can the series of very difficultchoices which9 as I gather from the documents, lie beforeus o                         (Intlclo)    Jo S.Wh i t eh al 1 G- a rd e ns s  S, W. 1,           May 7th,  1936,

ANGLO-WAN               In pursuance of Cabinet 34 (36) Conclusion 8, the3&apos;sforza-      Committee met to consider the Memorandum of the Secretary          of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 126 (36)), and also          had before them a Note by the Home Secretary entitled          &quot;Alternatives for the Egyptian Treaty&quot; (paper A.S.C.(36)2))          which, at the Meeting of the Cabinet, the Home Secretary          had undertaken to prepare.               The Committee examined Form 3 on page 2 of A.E.C. (36.J2,          and were informed by MR. CAMPBELL that it was very doubtful          indeed whether Sir Miles Lampson would be able to persuade          the Egyptians to accept a Treaty containing a provision by          which Egypt recognised that the special rights of His          Majesty&apos;s Government in relation to the Sues Canal existed          without time limit, and, a provision for the revision by          common agreement after 20 years of the stipulations of the          Treaty as tc the mode in which these rights would be          exercised, unless provision was made for reference to          the Council of the League of Nations of disputes on this          point.               THE MINISTER FOP CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE recognised          that this solution might be objectionable from, the Egyptian          point of view, but account must also be taken of the point          of view of Parliament and British public opinion, which          would, be extremely critical of any suggestion which involved.          putting a vital British interest in the hands of the League          of Nations or any other outside body.  The important          question was not how much the Egyptians were willing to          take but how far Parliament and public opinion at Home          could be persuaded to go.               THE HOME SECRETARY agreed and reminded the Committee          that the Cabinet had originally started with three stages -          &quot;A&quot;, &quot;E&quot; and &quot;C&quot; witn &quot;C&quot; as an absolute and. irreducible          minimum.   Subsequently even &quot;G&quot; had been abandoned and it          was not clear at what point, if any,  the line could now be                                  -1-
                                                   .107 drawn &quot;beyond which we should refuse to go.   We were in danger of  getting  on  a  slippery slope and it seemed very desirable to settle once and  for all the point beyond which we should refuse to  make  any further concessions.     It  was true that stages &quot;A&quot; , &quot;3&quot; and. UC&quot; had reference to the  evacuation of Cairo and Helouan, and that we had then thought that the  evacuation of Cairo was a concession of such importance that the  Egyptians would make little or no difficulty in regard to  the provisions dealing with the duration of the Treaty.     THE  MINISTER PGR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE drew attention to  the telegram  from Sir Miles Lampson of 5th May (No. 386) recording the conversation on that day with the Egyptian Prime minister in the course of which Sir Miles Lampson had stated.-          &quot;I had at present no idea whether His Majesty&apos;s           Government wore contemplating any modification           of their present attitude hut I had personally           been wondering how a suggestion that we should           give up Cairo and only retain Alexandria would           he received here.   Could His Excellency hazard           any opinion?&apos;&apos; It would  seem from this that the Egyptians had not yet been told that we were prepared to evacuate Cairo.     THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS had no doubt that Sir  Miles Lampson had already made the most of our readiness-ness to evacuate the city of Cairo,  though he had not yet said that we were prepared to abandon the whole Cairo area.   In speaking  as he had to the Egyptian prime Minister;  Sir miles lampson was no doubt trying to get some idea of how the Egyptiannegotiators would react to the latter proposal.     THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE pointed out thatForm B in fact represented what the  Committee of Imperial Defendhad suggested was the right solution,  namely,  that  the Treaty should contain a dominating clause,  recognising the  position ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government without  possibility of contradiction.     MR.  BECKETT stated that in the  view of  the Foreign Officethis had been secured by the draft Articles  9  and 16 (Annex  to cp, 126  (36)).
      THE HOME SECRETARY pointed out, however, that our inter- pretaticn of the text of these Articles might differ very materially from the interpretation placed upon them by the Egyptians.   He understood that in the view of the Foreign Office, in the events which had. happened, we had inherited&apos;the position in Egypt formerly occupied by Turkey, but he doubted whether this meant that we could remain on the Canal indefinitely against Egyptian wishes.      MR. BECKETT agreed that our legal position in Egypt is not so strong that it could not be questioned, but His Majesty&apos;s Government did contend that at the moment they had both the rights allotted to Turkey and the rights alloted to Egypt in the Suez Canal Convention.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS observed that the Cabinet had foreseen that it would not be possible to explain to the satisfaction of the House of Commons the real meaning of Clauses 9 and 16 as drafted by the Foreign Office, without making their implication clear to Egyptian public opinion, and for this and other reasons it had been thought that it would be better to make  the position absolutely clear from the outset in the draft submitted to the Egyptians.      Some discussion then took place as to the best way of phrasing Clauses 9 and 16 so that their language could be defended in the House of Commons without unduly disturbing the Egyptians.      General agreement was expressed with the view that  in present circumstances it would be out of the question to include  in  Clause 16 a provision to the effect that if the parties are unable  to agree upon the terms of the revised Treaty,  the difference will be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations.   It  would benecessary to report to the Cabinet that the  Committee saw thegreatest difficulty in persuading parliament  to accept  this,  orany similar formula.     In this connection THE MINISTER OF HEALTH expressed  the  viewthat  unless some satisfactory solution of this matter could befound, and he  could not see any such solution at. present,  it
 would be impossible  to  get. parliament  to  agree to a Treaty containing the  provisions  in  question,  and Parliament might even prefer the alternative of  going on as at present, without any Treaty.      In the course of subsequent  discussion,  it was pointed out that the Egyptians  would  use  against  us the fact that the 1928 and the 1930 draft Treaties  had contained references to arbitration by  the League  of  Nations.   It could, of course, be  pointed out  in reply that  the  position and prestige of the League  of  Nations in 1936  was nothing like so strong as had. been the case in 1928 and  1930.   The real point, however, was that we  must  insist on  having our position in relation to the Suez Canal  recognised by Egypt beyond possibility of doubt, and that we  could not in any circumstances  incur the risk of putting this vital  British interest in the hands  of some third party, whether  the  League of Nations or  any other body, in 20 years&apos; time.      MR.  CAMPBELL observed  that the Egyptians would certainly refuse  to accept this point of view.    There might in conse- quence be serious trouble  in  Egypt, and we should have heavily to  reinforce the British troops in Egypt for the protection of the  Canal and the maintenance of  order.   Disturbances in Egypt might well be followed by disturbances  in Palestine and possibly in  Irak  and  other parts of Arabia, due  to Moslem sympathy with Egyptian Moslem aspirations.      THE MINISTER OF HEALTH thought that the House of Commons would prefer such a state of  things as  Mr. Campbell had. described, rather than that a vital British interest  should be at  the disposal in 20 years&apos;  time of some third party.     THE HOME SECRETARY then pointed out that the Government of the  Commonwealth of Australia objected most  strongly  to  any suggestion that our control over the Canal should be  in  any wayweakened now or hereafter.   If the Government were to use theirmajority in order to  secure the passage through parliament  of  the
( provision for a reference to the League of Nations or some third party, this would impose a very great strain on Imperial relations, and we should he accused by Australia and New Zealand of endangering their life-line, a thing which we had undertaken not to do save after consultation and in agreement with them.   On the other hand, if we had. to break with Egypt on the proposition that the British Commonwealth of Nations has, and always must have, this specially privileged position in Egypt, then we at ail events maintained intact the Imperial point of view.     THE MINISTER FOR GO-ORDINATION OE DEFENCE thought that our prestige would suffer another humiliating blow if we accepted this reference to a third party.   On the other hand, refusal to entertain the suggestion would, in his view, enhance our prestige.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS reminded the Committee that in 1919, when there were serious disturbances in Egypt, it had been found necessary to station b infantry divisions and. a cavalry division in the country.   It would be a very serious matter indeed if we had to face disturbances on the same scale. Nevertheless, he agreed that it did. not appear practicable to go further than was suggested in Form B of A.B.C. (36) 2.     After some discussion, it was agreed that the views of the Committee would be net by adopting Clause 9,  as drafted, of the Annex to CP. 126 (36), and also Clause 16 down to the word &quot;exist&quot; in line 5.    The remainder of Clause 16, from the words &quot;it being understood&quot; to thewords &quot;League of Nations&quot;,  to be deleted.
Ill     It was also agreed that Sir Miles Lampson should hewarned of the serious parliamentary and. Dominion objectionsto the insertion in the Treaty of any provision which might give rise to doubts as to our future position in relation tothe Suez Canal, or which might place vital British interestsin Egypt in the hands of some outside body.   In his dis-cussions with the Egyptians he should not over-emphasise theLeague of Nations aspect, but should indicate that HisMajesty&apos;s Government think it undesirable that this power should be given to an outside body,   He should., moreover,make the most of our concession regarding the evacuation ofCairo an d H e1o uan.     The Committee&apos;s conclusions may be summarised as follows          (1) To report to the Cabinet that having              regard inter alia to the grave-              objections, both from the point of              view of the Dominions and of public              opinion at home,  there would be the              greatest possible difficulty in              persuading parliament to accept any              provisions in the Treaty which would              at the end of a fixed period invest              the Council of the League of Nations              or some outside body with the power              to decide the number of troops which              His Majesty&apos;s Government should              maintain in the Canal zone in order              to render the Canal safe in the              event  of Egypt and the United              Kingdom being -unable to agree.
