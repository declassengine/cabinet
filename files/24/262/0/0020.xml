This Bill, which has been introduced by  a  labour     member,  proposes  to  apply to  Scotland Part  II of the Weights     and measures Act,  1389, which contains provisions  dealing     with the sale of  coal.   The  matter has hitherto been dealt     with in  Scotland  under the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1892,     and by an extension  of that Act to counties.   These     enactments have,  however, proved unsatisfactory, and County     Councils have pressed for the application of Part  II of     the Act  of 1889 to Scotland,   Town Councils appear  also to     desire this, and  some local authorities already possess     similar  powers under local Acts.               The Board  of Trade  and my Department accept the     principle of the  Bill, and if there is no opposition I     desire the authority of my colleagues to assist its  progress     through  its further  stages subject to any necessary  drafting     amendments,                               (Id.)
