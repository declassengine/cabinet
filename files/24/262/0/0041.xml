Confidential.)Sir,                                                  Paris, May 20, 1936.    I HAVE the  honour to inform you  that  yesterday  at  the end  of  myconversation with M. Leger, reported  in my telegram No.  217 of the 19th May,I asked whether he could give me any indication of the attitude that the represen-tatives of the French Government were likely to adopt at the  Council meetingon the 15th June.    2.  M. Leger replied that in  this transitional period he obviously could  not do more than tell me what the present position was as far as the Quai d&apos;Orsaywas concerned, and that he would do in confidence.  He was to discuss the inter-national situation  to-day or to-morrow with M.  Sarraut and M. Paul-Boncour,and he had no reason to think that they would quarrel with his conclusions. They,in turn, would then see M. Blum, and if  the  latter agreed, as M. Leger hopedhe would, the French Ambassador in  London would be  instructed  to lay before you the decisions thus arrived at jointly by the present and future Cabinets, andhe very much hoped that it would be possible for our two Governments to act inunison at Geneva.    3.  M. Leger  then proceeded to  set forth his  ideas of the line which  theFrench representatives would take up.  He  considered that  it was essential  forthem to be firm on such questions  as the recognition  of the Italian annexation of abyssinia, the Jibuti Railway and the status of the Legation  guards, and  theadditional French and  British units at Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa : these wereuseful bargaining  counters which should  not  be thrown away.    4.  On the other  hand, he was of the opinion that the French Governmentwould insist at the forthcoming meeting on  the immediate raising of sanctions.On legal  grounds there was  nothing in the Covenant  which justified their maintenance once hostilities had ceased.  Sanctions  were devised to prevent war or to put a stop to a war which had broken out.  They had, unfortunately, in this case failed to effect their  purpose, but sanctions had never  been meant to be apunitive measure and they should now cease.      8624   [13282]    &apos;                                            B
    5.  Secondly,  on practical grounds,  he had come to the conclusion that themaintenance of sanctions  would serve no purpose.  Evasion,  already  difficultenough to prevent, would gradually become general, causing discontent at homeand  dissension abroad.  France and Great Britain would eventually be foundto be  almost the only countries enforcing sanctions, while Italy  would graduallyrecover her markets,  which was the  process that would suit her best.  For he had reason to believe that simultaneous raising of all the sanctions with the financial obligations thereby entailed would, at the present moment, actually  be embarrassing-rassing to the Italian Government.    6.  Finally, on political grounds, he had no doubt of the wisdom of this step,for he was sure  that if the  Council announced its  intention of  continuingsanctions Italy would leave the League.  Last year we had all agreed that it was desirable to keep Italy at Geneva and, in order to do that, we had been obliged to&quot;menager&quot; her at  times  and  even to  make concessions which impaired  thecomplete efficacy of League action.    7.  Having paid the price to keep Italy at Geneva, it would be folly now totake a step of which the only result would be to drive her out of the League and into the arms  of Germany.  He said that according to the reports which he hadreceived from Berlin  Hitler&apos;s attitude to Italy had undergone a remarkable changewithin the last few weeks.   He probably still disliked Mussolini, but his contempthad been changed to admiration, and for the first time M. Leger thought that therewas a real danger  of an understanding between Germany and Italy, which mightwell take the form of a deal over Austria.    8.  M. Leger admitted that the course he advocated would look unpleasantlylike capitulating to force, and that it would be necessary to find some means of strengthening the shaken confidence of the smaller States.   As far as Yugoslavia,Greece and Turkey were concerned,  he thought that this could best be effected bysome form of pact which would guarantee the status quo in the Mediterranean.He repeated in favour of such a system the familiar arguments which M. Flandinhas often used in  the past, and he  thought that  the opening of negotiations ofthis kind would give to Mussolini food for thought, and to us a useful opportunityof bringing pressure to bear on the Italian Government.   I explained that itwould be  difficult, I thought, for  His  Majesty&apos;s Government to embark  on negotiations with Italy at this stage.  Fie quite understood this, and said that acertain amount of  progress might be made before it was necessary to bring italy in, and that, when that  moment arrived, the first step  might be taken by  theFrench Government, who,  in  this instance, were not embarrassed by an  over-squeamish public opinion.    9.  At the end of our talk M. Leger promised to let me know the outcome ofthe conversations between M. Sarraut,  M. Paul-Boncour, and M. Blum, pendingwhich  discussions of policy must necessarily be of an academic nature.  I have,however, ventured  to put this conversation on record, as it is not improbable that french policy at Geneva in June may be found to be in accord with  the views expressed by M. Leger.                                             I have, &amp;c.                                                  H. LLOYD THOMAS.[R  2800/73/3]                     No. 2.               Sir E. Phipps to Mr. Eden. (Received May 15.)(No. 496.   Confidential.)Sir,                                                  Berlin, May 12, 1936.    I HAVE had the honour several times recently to draw your attention to the concern with which Herr Hitler regards the situation in Austria, and the possiblypremature  ripening of the Austrian Nazi  plum in view  of Signor MussolinFsunexpectedly rapid  Abyssinian success, which will enable  Italy to play her partagain on the Brenner far sooner than Herr Hitler was led by his military experts to expect.    2.  The paradoxical position has therefore been reached where the victoriousaggressor in Africa forms the chief, if  not the only, obstacle to an important stepon the path of German aggression or at least aggressive expansion in Europe.
     3.   When  France showed herself  to  be backward in applying  sanctions against Signor Mussolini, she was often urged to remember that Abyssinia was a &quot; test-case &quot; for action some day against Germany.  This argument strikes me more and more as disingenuous, for it was clear that German expansion would not, anyhow in its first stages, take the form of actual aggression such as would j ustify the use of sanctions by the League of Nations.  Nor was it ever likely that British public opinion would react with sufficient vigour to justify or render  possible the imposition of such sanctions in the case of a reoccupation of the Rhineland or of a German &apos;&apos; response &quot; to  a pressing demand by a large number of  Austrian citizens or of Sudeten Germans for incorporation in the German Reich.  Would British public  opinion  indeed  approve of any very drastic action to  prevent the return to Germany of the corridor, Silesia, Memel or Danzig ?  Later on, perhaps, public indignation might be aroused by some positive act of German aggression in the Ukraine or elsewhere, but by that time  Germany would be  so  strong that indignation would probably be platonic and in any case ineffectual.     4.  But let us suppose, for  the  sake of  argument, that it were decided to impose sanctions on Germany.   Does anybody really believe that so resolute a leader as Herr Hitler would be deflected from his course by any  such  decision? Herr Hitler is well aware that Germany was exposed to a relentless blockade during the four years of war, and he is convinced, rightly or wrongly, that it was neither the blockade nor the war on two fronts, but  internal  dissension, which was the prime cause of Germany&apos;s breakdown.  It is more than doubtful whether sanctions in time of peace, even if generally enforced for an indefinite period, could bring Germany to her knees.  The policy of autarchy, adopted when Herr  Hitler took office, has been pursued with redoubled vigour since the imposition of sanctions on Italy, and there is little doubt that Germany&apos;s supply of food-stuffs, synthetic oil. synthetic  rubber and fibre substitutes would render her immune.   In this sense the failure of the League to bring Mussolini to his knees  by the policy of  sanctions must be regarded as a blessing in disguise.  Had Italy succumbed, the peoples of Europe, lulled  into a false sense of security, would have abstained from further effort.  They would have relied upon sanctions to save themselves in case of need, and would have neglected the  only defences likely to impress Herr Hitler or to- prove effective against him.     For that matter it is doubtful whether  Germany&apos;s small neighbours could in the last resort be induced, by Geneva to take the risk of refusing to trade  with her. In  the case of  Czechoslovakia, such a refusal would be tantamount to  imposing sanctions  against herself, for her trade with and through Germany must be vital to her.  It would be a bold Dutch Government that  would risk the consequences of closing their frontier to Germany.   Even if the Netherlands could rely upon theultimate victory of the League, could they face the risk of German military occupa- tion within a  few hours of  the declaration  of  sanctions ?   Nor are any  of Germany&apos;s other neighbours in a much safer position. The predicament of Poland would not be enviable, and the imposition of sanctions would probably lead to the last-minute defection of one or more of the Scandinavian countries.    Recent debates in the House of Commons, as well as correspondence in the British press, have disclosed the existence of what is to my mind a most dangerous fallacy, namely, the belief that Germany&apos;s policy would have been affected, had the defeat of Mussolini been brought  about by  the  recent action of the League. Nothing could  be  further  from the truth.   It must not be  imagined  that herr Hitler and his friends are building up the most formidable military machine in the world to-day merely to relegate it to the scrap-heap when threatened withsanctions, even  if the  hitherto despised Italian nation had  yielded  to their pressure.  On the contrary, this country  would rally like one man to  the clarioncall of the &apos;&apos; Fuhrer &apos;&apos; and again astonish the world by its fortitude and resolution in resistance.    5.  Since writing the above, I have read Sir George Clerk&apos;s telegram No. 62,Saving, of the 8th May, reporting M. Leon Blum&apos;s wish to &quot; restore vitality tothe League &quot; by &quot; propounding some scheme for general disarmament.&quot;  M. Blumapparently even professes to believe that Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini would &quot; bow to  the inevitable &quot; &quot;if  England, France and Russia were to take up astrong attitude on disarmament with the approbation of practically the entireworld.&quot;  I notice that M. Blum does not mention Japan.    6.  If M. Blum really thinks that the heavily-armed and successful treaty-breakers Japan, Italy and Germany would  disarm  at the behest of himself,.      [13282]                                                     B 2
M. Litvinov, and- a notoriously disarmed Britain, he makes a big mistake.  If he were able to put his dangerous theory into practice he would cause quite a big war(with most of the trumps, or arms, in the wrong hands).    I notice, however, that M. Blum adds that &apos;&apos; the  Socialist party wanted tohave moral justice on their side and to put themselves right with world opinion by propounding a scheme of general disarmament.&quot;    7.  It is devoutly to be hoped that this last-named process will not take too long and that the new French Government will, without too much loss of time, look at things as they are and not as they would like them to be or as they would wishtheir electors to be blind enough to believe them to be.    8.  To return to the Brenner.   I think it  is important to realise that ifAustria is not already nestling in Germania&apos;s bosom, it is due not to German fearof League  resolutions or even sanctions, but to Herr Hitler&apos;s newly aroused  andhealthy awe of Signor Mussolini, who now, according to his own declaration, hasjoined the ranks of the satisfied Powers.  This situation is not likely, however, to last indefinitely.   Herr Hitler is nothing if not dynamic, and if the satisfiedPowers do not soon  decide to compose their differences he may take advantagethereof to induce the  Duce, infuriated but not overcome by sanctions, to reach someunhealthy agreement with himself over the Austrian and other problems.    9.  Eight years passed in Austria and Nazi Germany have convinced me thatthe loss of the former&apos;s independence and her merging in the ranks of Nazidomwould be a far greater blow to civilisation than even the inclusion  of Abyssiniain the new Eoman Empire.  I have therefore felt it my duty to draw your attentionto what seems the greater evil in order that its imminence may not be obscured bya too continuous or exclusive contemplation of the lesser.                                                    I have, &amp;c.                                                         ERIC PHIPPS.[J 3713/1000/1]                   No. 3.             Sir E. Drummond to Mr. Eden. (Received May 1.)(No.  499.)Sir,                                                  Rome, April 25, 1936.    YOU were good enough under cover of your despatch No.  451 of the 17thApril to forward  to me a copy of  Berlin  despatch  No. 378 of the 8th  Aprilenclosing the summary of an article written by the Rome correspondent of theBerliner  Tageblatt  dealing with the present political situation  in  this country.His more important conclusions, you may recall, were as follows :  A great changehas taken place in Italy in the last few months; she is conscious of her strengthand of the unexpected weakness of her opponents; she is filled with a sense ofsuperiority and has lost her respect for England.  Italy will not  declare war, but is  preparing for it.  An agreed  settlement of the Anglo-Italian  dispute will only be possible when Great Britain &quot; refrains from opposing the Italian claims in Africa &quot;; any attempt to exert pressure on Italy with a view to ending the african enterprise  will mean war.  Sanctions should for safety&apos;s sake thereforebe discontinued.    2.  The role of a prophet who cries &apos;&apos; Wolf !  Wolf ! &apos;&apos; can never be popular,and  I am conscious that during the course of the long-drawn-out abyssinian dispute  I have been obliged on more than  one occasion to  draw the attentionof His Majesty&apos;s Government to the real danger of war between Italy  and my country,  which I believed  to exist if certain sets  of  circumstances were  to be present.  You will recall that the first of these instances  occurred  when  theattitude  of  France seemed to be  in doubt.  So  soon as it  was made clear byan ad hoc arrangement that France would stand solid with Great Britain shouldthe latter be attacked in the Mediterranean as a result of  the pursuance of apolicy consonant with her League obligations, that danger disappeared, for thetime being at least, below the horizon.   Later, the attitude of Germany becameof importance.   If, I held, the Italians believed that Germany would  join inany European conflagi-ation which they might be disposed to set alight in  orderto mask the failure of their policy in  East Africa, then the possibility of warcould not, in my view, be disregarded (my despatch No. 98 of the 25th January).
    3.  Events have since moved  forward,  and we are now faced with an Italyconscious of a military victory within her  grasp  and  proportionately  elated.The Italian  Government hope to occupy Harrar and Addis Ababa before the rains and make,  or rather enforce, terms on the Abyssinians soon afterwards.Such  terms may  be concluded with the present Emperor or with  some puppetwhom the Italian authorities would set up in his place.  The Italians would, nodoubt, arrange, as  did the Japanese in Manchuria,  for  various  demonstrationsof loyalty towards the new Emperor from the different provinces and territories of which they will be in occupation.  They would claim that these proved the realwishes of the great mass of the population and even appeal to the dectrine of self-determination to  support their pretensions.  On the assumption that the italians were  to be convinced that the policy of the sanctionist Powers always inspiredand directed, in Italian eyes, by Great Britain was definitely designed to deprive the Italian  nation  of  the  final  fruits of their  victory, I should once again, asI stated recently in my telegram No.  252, feel that the situation had taken a graveturn.  Such a situation might be produced, for instance, if the sanctionist Powers,in spite of the success of Italy, but in the absence of a final international politicalliquidation  of the situation in  Abyssinia,  refused to lift the ban of sanctions against this country.   It is  very difficult to assess the strain to which thesesanctions are subjecting the Italian nation.   The effects, of  course, thoughundoubtedly severe,  are cumulative.   But as long ago as last August (see mydespatch No. 914. of the 6th August, 1935), I anticipated that Italy might wellbe able  to hold out for two years  from the outbreak  of hostilities, and I  do not now believe that  the point of practical crisis will be in  sight before the  end ofthis year. Nevertheless, if the head of the Government were to realise that though he had  obtained his direct Abyssinian aims,  the economic and financial ruin ofhis country threatened in the distance, it is not inconceivable that he  might,knowing his present military and air  strength,  risk everything in an endeavourto break the ring  by attacking the Power whom he holds to be the principal if notthe  sole  instigator  of  sanctionist  policy.    The  Sudan,   Egypt  and  theMediterranean afford him  clear and, he  might consider, remunerative objectives.He certainly has the  men  with which  to attempt  such  an enterprise and hisair force is daily becoming more numerous and more efficient.    4.  Once again, as throughout the whole  history of the Italo-abyssinian dispute, the key to the position seems to lie in the hands of  the French Government.If the French, in spite of  all their recent undertakings,  were to  remain neutralin the event of such an attack, or if Signor Mussolini were to believe that theywTould remain neutral,  the  danger I  have sketched above must needs, in my view,be taken in all seriousness.  It may be argued that the Duce  has lately impliedin conversation that it would be madness  to attack Great Britain (see my telegramNo. 186 of the 27th March), but, as I have recently pointed out (see my telegramNo. 250), his view is that while neither he nor His Majesty&apos;s Government desirewar, events  may inevitably lead to such a disaster.   It may be assumed with theutmost confidence that the inherent weakness in the British case is well recognisedhere,  viz., the apparent incompatibility  of a policy based on the  one hand uponthe Covenant, and particularly upon  article  16, and on the other upon  a firmdetermination to avoid  war (vide  passim many of the  recent speeches of HisMajesty&apos;s Ministers).  Further, the revelations to which the writer of the Germanarticle refers regarding the lack of ammunition  in Great Britain may also have their  effect.  (Incidentally I do not think Dr. Kramer is right in  holding thatone of the reasons for Italy&apos;s loss of respect  for England is to be sought in theinactivity of the British fleet in  the Mediterranean;  the naval  reinforcements in the Mediterranean have been regarded as a threat and Italian national feelingshave been correspondingly exacerbated.  This  is scarcely the same.thing as a lossof respect.  The  Italians,  except  during the  first few days,  did  not expect theBritish fleet to bombard Italian ports and harbours.)    5.  If the views expressed above are sound, the moral is clear.  If sanctionsare to continue,  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  must be absolutely sure  that  theFrench  will go to all lengths in defence of  the common League policy.                                                I have, &amp;c.                                                     ERIC DRUMMOND.
[R  2995/2132/22]                  No.  4.            Sir E. Druramond to Mr. Eden. [Received  May 25.)(No. 593.)Sir,                                                   Rome, May 19, 1936.    THE Council of the League of Nations is due to meet again on the 15th June,.primarily to consider the course  of events following on the occupation of  addis ababa  by  the  Italian High  Command,  and  in particular to  take decisions regarding  the  future of  the  present League policy  under article  16 of theCovenant.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are,  of course,  in  a position to  appraisethe various factors in the  situation from a wide and intimate knowledge denied to heads of missions at  particular  posts abroad.   At the same time, it may perhaps be useful if I attempt to estimate briefly the possible results of some  ofthe courses of action  which  will come up  for discussion and  decision at Geneva in June, as seen from a purely Roman angle.  I may perhaps be  allowed to add,by way of preface, that those of us whose  duty it has been to live  in this countryday in and day out for the last sixteen months may, I hope, be considered immune from  the suspicion of any desire to allow the  Italians  to  &apos;&apos; get away &apos;&apos;  with the fruits of their  aggression.   If it is true that the Italian  character has not been seen at its best from the  date of Walwal onwards, it is  certain that it is nowseen  at its worst;  and the past  sixteen months have not been conspicuouslypleasant  for   this  Embassy.   The boasting,  the  posturing,   the  rampantnationalism,  the  gross misrepresentation of  the British attitude,  the absurdegotism and conceit  have  been enough to turn the  least queasy of Anglo-Saxonstomachs.    2.  At Geneva three  policies  seem possible :  (a)  An increase in sanctions,leading possibly to military measures, such, for instance, as the closing  of the suez  Canal; (b) the maintenance of the existing sanctions; (c) the raising of theexisting sanctions.    3.  The feasibility of (a) lies without my province. Presumably it  will onlybe contemplated if His Majesty&apos;s Government  are convinced beyond a possibilityof doubt that the French Government will march hand in hand and step by step with  them in  the execution  of  such a  policy.  From past and more  recentdeclarations of Signor Mussolini it seems more than probable that, if additionalsanctions were  imposed, he would be ready to  go to war in defence of the fruitsof his Abyssinian victory.   It will, of course, be argued  that to  do so  knowingthat France and England  would fight side by  side with all the strength at theircommand would  be  tantamount to  committing  suicide.  If I  were sure that signor Mussolini were in  his turn convinced that France  and England  would  sofight, and that Germany, in such an eventuality, would remain entirely passive,then I would be prepared to endorse  this argument, and would feel that it would preclude Signor  Mussolini  from  proceeding   to  extremes.  But I  fear that,whatever guarantees the French  Government may give  to His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment, Signor Mussolini will himself remain unconvinced, and will count on  alarge divergent body of opinion in France to render active, complete and whole-hearted collaboration an impossibility; his scepticism will be based in part upon his belief that many Frenchmen will  hold that  French action against Italy wouldresult in a fresh  German move.   So long as a doubt remains in his mind that france and Great Britain will not make war together in the sense in which they made war in 1914-18, so long will the very great danger exist that the Duce mayset light to a European bonfire.    4.  If it were to be decided to maintain the existing sanctions, presumablythe Council would put forward some statement  by way of explanation to the worldof the grounds for this decision,  and it may well be that these grounds would  be summed up in the phrase : No reward for the aggressor.  In Italy, on the otherhand, the  cry  would be  immediately raised  that we  were  attempting to usesanctions for a purpose for which they were never designed, namely, to punish theso-called aggressor, whereas their real object, as defined  in the Covenant, is  to shorten or to render  impossible an unjust  war.    5.  During the  last few days I have had many visits from my colleagues,who have seemed anxious to lay before me, without the least prompting on mypart, their several views on the policy which should now be adopted by the presentsanctionist Powers.   Most of  them  seem  to assume that  sanctions are doomed,.
 and they have pointed out that, if it is decided to maintain the existing provisions, it is  only  too probable  that  various States will,  one by one, drop  out  of  the sanctionist front.  They  further suggest that, since major military operations are now apparently over in Abyssinia, Italy&apos;s expenditure will decrease and the strain on  her  gold reserve correspondingly diminish.   Although  definite evidence is lacking, I find there is a general belief that evasions of the sanctionist regulations are now being practised,  and that an increasing number of loopholes are likely to arise, of which Italy would take full advantage.  In general, the majority of my colleagues hold that for  these and other reasons it would be best not  to attempt the maintenance of the existing regime  against Italy.     6.  For  myself  I have already reported (see  paragraph  3  of  my despatch No. 499 of the 25th April) that in my view the point of practical crisis in  the economic and financial position of  this country,  if the existing  sanctions  are maintained, is unlikely to be  in sight before the end  of the year, that is to  say within another seven or eight months. I adhere to that view, with the reservation, of course, that owing to military success the strain due to payments for essential war imports could certainty be greatly  diminished, with the result  that the day of crisis might well be correspondingly postponed.  We are here dealing with hypotheses, but it may be that the interim period is now more  likely to be in  the neighbourhood of  twelve than of eight months.   Further,  the  recent victories will have enhanced the Italian  determination to consolidate their gains, and in proportion will have increased their readiness to make even  greater sacrifices at the cost of their standard of  living.     7.  Meanwhile,  before  this point is reached, what will be the situation  in Italy?  As  I have already  reported, the possibility that Signor Mussolini will attempt to break the ring if he sees financial and  economic  ruin staring him  in the face cannot be ignored.  Hence the conclusion  in my  despatch No. 499, that if sanctions are to be maintained we must be sure that France will go to all lengths in pursuit of the common League policy.  But during  this period of some twelve months it seems to me probable, as  it does to my  colleagues,  that a number of States may secede from the sanctionist front.  You will recall  that in my telegram No. 298 of the 11th May,  Signor Guarneri was reported as holding that a gradual crumbling of the sanctionist front would best suit the Italian book.  He was, of course, speaking from the economic  and financial angle, and from  the point of view of an official dealing with the technicalities of trade, and having particularly in mind the pre-sanctions trade debts owing by Italy, there may be a good deal in what he says.  Further, there  can be little doubt that  such a gradual  crumbling could  and would be represented by the Italian Government as a political victory as well as an economic advantage. A gradual defection of one State after another from the sanctionist front would be honey and roses to the Propaganda Ministry and their leader writers,  and  we should, I think, do our best to  avoid any such possibility.  Indeed, from a purely political standpoint and as viewed solely from Rome, I would myself prefer to see the simultaneous raising of sanctions  by  all States now imposing them, rather than a gradual crumbling, such as  might result if course (b) were adopted.  If, however, the danger apprehended by my colleagues is in your view highly exaggerated, then, of course, this point falls to the ground.     8.   I turn to the position which would follow a total abrogation of sanctions at the June meeting.  This action would, of course, be regarded by the Italian Government as a political success  of the  first  magnitude,  though I naturally presume that the raising  of sanctions will not necessarily be followed by a recog- nition of Italian claims concerning Abyssinia.   A consideration of such claims could, I believe, well be postponed till the meeting of the Assembly of the League in September, when the  de facto position will be clarified.   The raising  of sanctions would also ease to a great extent the economic and financial position, since it would enable the  Italian Government once again to export and therefore to obtain the means of payment for essential imports.  But, of course, the cessation of sanctions would not in itself, and beyond what is  said in the previous sentence, improve the Italian economic situation,  which would in fact  revert in essentials to what it was before last autumn.  Further, if sanctions  are raised in this way we must expect no gratitude whatever from the Italians.  They will regard this action as tantamount to acknowledging a gigantic mistake and their attitude will be : A return to realities  and better late than never.     9.  There is one other point in connexion with  a policy based on the raising-of sanctions to which I would wish to call your  attention.  You will recall that
in my telegram No. 305 of the 14th May I indicated that  it would be best to dismiss from our minds the possibility of using the lifting of sanctions as alever with which to restore Ras Tafari to his throne.   It may be, however, thatthere are those who  hold that the abrogation of sanctions could be utilised in orderto obtain from Signor  Mussolini certain desiderata in Abyssinia, such, forexample, as (a) the non-recruitment of a large native army; (b) the open doorfor trade in Abyssinia for certain nations;  and (c) a proper treatment  of thenative population.   To assume that Signor Mussolini would lend a sympatheticear to proposals of  this kind is, I believe, to mistake the man&apos;s character.  Theseare not points on which he will bargain.  On the other hand, it is in my opinionmore  than probable that if he were approached in  the right way and  asked togive these assurances as  a  spontaneous gesture and not in such a manner as theItalian mind would be only too eager to construe as blackmail, he would  respond.    10.  Finally, in  attempting  to estimate the relative effects of policies (a).(b) and (c) upon future Anglo-Italian  relations it would, I submit, be a mistake-to suppose that any decision taken is likely to cause a quick healing of the breachnow apparent&apos;between the  two countries.  In the most favourable circumstances it will take  at least a year, if not more,  before the relations between  our twocountries can be expected to become what they were at the end of 1934, namely,friendly.  Taking,  however, those  relations  as  an isolated factor in the wholeEuropean problem,  it is, I  think, certain that the advantages accruing from theadoption of  course  (c) will naturally in  the long run prove considerable.                                                I have. &amp;c.                                                     ERIC DRUMMOND.
