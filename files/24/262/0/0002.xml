THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  April 1936.SECRET.CP. 112 (36).CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TEEATY.                             PRESENT POSITION.         Memorandum by  the Secretary of State  for Foreign Affairs.     1.   THE original  instructions for  Sir  Miles Lampson  laid  down three alternative proposals which he was to make to the Egyptian Government:  thefirst represented the maximum  of what  His Majesty&apos;s Government desired tosecure, the third, the minimum,  which they were prepared to accept.  The firstproposal, A, was that he should endeavour to obtain Egyptian acceptance of a formula  that until such  time as  Egypt, to the satisfaction of both parties, wasin a position herself adequately  to assume the protection of her own territory,it should be agreed that the naval, military  and  air forces of the  two parties should be regarded  as pooled in the common interest, with the corollary of nolimitation as to  numbers, dispositions,  &amp;c. This formula was to be put forward for exploration  and study;  and if the  High Commissioner was satisfied thatthe Egyptian mood was unreceptive, he was to proceed to the second stage in sucha way that the  concession it involved should not lose the advantages it mightconfer hj having the character of a spontaneous and goodwill offer.    The second  stage, B, involved the evacuation of the Citadel and Kasr-el-Nilbarracks by the  British troops in Cairo and their withdrawal to  Abbassia andHelmia in the suburbs of the city, British troops being,  however, maintained at or near Alexandria and in the Canal Zone. If this proposal proved unacceptablein its  turn, Sir  Miles Lampson  should propose the  evacuation by  the  Britishtroops of Cairo  itself and the suburbs of  Abbassia and Helmia and their with-drawal to Helouan,  some fifteen  miles to the South.   In this case, too,  Britishtroops remain at or near Alexandria  and in the  Canal Zone.  This proposal.however, which His Majesty&apos;s Government did not view with any great favour,was not to be put forward without prior reference  in good time to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.    2.  When the negotiations began on the 9th March, it soon became clear thatthe Egyptians were not viewing the problem in a realistic light, and that, in spiteof  arguments demonstrating that  Italian  action had  produced  a militarysituation far different from that prevailing at the time of the last negotiations in1930 and that it was fraught with considerable danger to Egypt, they would not accept the idea of the pooling of British and Egyptian resources  for the joint defence of Egypt.  This attitude  seems to have been due  partly to a difficulty ingrasping the meaning of the suggestion, but in  the course of  the discussions ithas also become clear that the Egyptian negotiators considered that an arrange-ment on these lines would entail  encroachment on  full Egyptian sovereignty, asnecessarily meaning more  than  the association of British  with the Egyptianforces and as involving in practice the continued occupation of Egypt  by Britishtroops.  Their position is that, except  in time of war, no sovereign State could accept an equal partnership with  an allied army on its own territory.

    3.  In these circumstances, Sir Miles Lampson proceeded to Stage B.  over this  proposal Nab as  Pasha  made  difficulties  also.  The  offer  to  evacuateKasr-el-Nil  and  the  Citadel  produced  no great  effect,  the reason being,  in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s opinion, that this step had been discounted by contemporarydiscussion in the Egyptian press.  Nahas Pasha further argued that retention ofBritish troops at Alexandria  was unnecessary, since he was ready to  agree to increased numbers for the British forces in the Canal Zone, to the constructionof new and the improvement of existing communications from the Zone acrossthe Delta to the  West, to the provision  of such landing grounds, &amp;c,  in  theWestern Desert as were necessary for the Royal Air Force,  and to the executionof all the above to the satisfaction of the British Military Mission which wouldbe invited to Egypt as a result of the treaty.    4.  Discussions on these offers, which were made on the 19th March, havebeen proceeding ever since, and have developed on the whole in an unexpectedlysatisfactory  manner.   Further  reference will  be  made to them  below.   Incommenting on his conversation on the 19th March, Sir Miles Lampson expressedthe tentative opinion (i) that it might be  possible to secure an  acceptablearrangement as  regards  the continued presence of British  troops at  or nearAlexandria, though it would be necessary to fight hard for this and success wasnot certain;  (ii) that  the  Egyptians would definitely refuse to agree to Britishtroops remaining  in Cairo or its suburbs, and that if His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentinsisted on this a break was almost certain; and (iii)  that the same might well prove to be the case  with regard to the proposal  to  post  the Cairo troops atHelouan.    5.  In the course of  discussions on the offers mentioned in the preceding paragraph, and as the outcome of certain aspects  of  them,  the proposal underStage B having proved abortive,  Stage  C was reached.  It  became necessary todecide whether Sir  Miles Lampson  might be authorised  to put  forward  thesuggestion contained therein.  His Majesty&apos;s Government  decided that authority might be given to His Majesty5s High Commissioner to proceed to Stage C.Meanwhile,  Sir Miles Lampson had emphasised his opinion that it would beimpossible to secure  Egyptian agreement to the stationing  of British forces atHelouan, and he advised that, in the light of the satisfactory development of  the offers made  by Nahas Pasha, it would be well to  abandon the Helouan  proposal and  to close with  the advantageous offers  of  the Egyptians.   Since it  wasnecessary to examine these offers and reach decisions upon them., and since it  wasalso necessary for His Majesty5s Government to decide  whether they were willingto go beyond Stage C (Helouan), which had originally been laid down as their maximum concession,  it was impossible at once (even if it should eventually prove possible) to authorise the High Commissioner to accept Nahas Pasha5s proposals and to inform him whether or not insistence on Helouan would still be necessary.In case, however, it might be in any way helpful to him in  preserving the satis-factory atmosphere of the discussions and in securing the  further satisfactorydevelopment of Nahas Pasha&apos;s  offers, he was informed  that he could,  at  themoment he  considered opportune, foreshadow the  readiness of His Majesty5sGovernment  to evacuate Abbassia and Helmia in favour of  Helouan.   It should perhaps here be pointed out that two meetings between the British and Egyptiandelegations  were being held  weekly, that any break or deadlock was  highly understandable and that  it was necessary to keep  Nahas Pasha  in play in respect ofhis proposals.     6.   On the receipt of Sir Miles Lampson5s first intimation that it  might beimpossible to secure  Egyptian  agreement to the  proposal regarding  Helouan(Stage  C),  the Chiefs  of Staff had considered the matter  and prepared a report(C.I.D. Paper No. 1225-B of  the 1st April, 1936), which, indeed, envisaged thepossibility of entirely evacuating  the Cairo area (on condition that British troopsremained in the Canal Zone and that a larger British garrison was stationed at alexandria) if such action were considered necessary on political grounds for thepurpose of  securing a  treaty,  but  which  also pointed  out  the  militarydisadvantages inherent in such action (C.I.D. Paper No.  1225-B, Secret, of the1st April, 1936).  . Upon this, in view of later developments with regard  to NahasPasha5 s offers, I  wrote a letter to the  Committee  of  Imperial Defence, statingthat, in my opinion, it would be  politically desirable for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-
 merit to abandon insistence on the location of a British garrison at Helouan, in spite of the military disadvantages entailed by such a move, as set out by the Chiefs of Staff in their report.  In doing so, attention was called to the views of the  General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in  Egypt, as reported in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram No. 28, Saving, of the 2nd April.  These were as follows :       &quot;2.  Cairo.         &quot; (a) Affords a better place for a mobile reserve than anywhere else in     Egypt, but, provided communications are improved, the difference in time of     movement between having a mobile reserve in Cairo or having it in the Canal     Zone would only be a matter of hours.         &quot; (b) With the increased speed of movement due to the development of     mechanisation, it seems less necessary now to keep forces in Cairo to quell     internal unrest.  We don&apos;t want our Army to act as a police reserve and to     be  called upon frequently,  but  only to come  if  rioting is developing to     insurrection.         &quot; (c) Provided we retain our Headquarters in Cairo and have a strong     British mission with the Egyptian Army,  we  ought to be  able to keep in     touch with the internal situation, and to know whether any revolts were being     hatched in the Army.         &quot;(d) Deduction. The real risk of removing British troops from Cairo is     the difficulty of establishing a base and recovering control  of all  means of     communication with  a  really hostile  Egyptian Government in power.         &quot; But if an agreed treaty is considered of  the greatest  importance and     negotiations are likely to break down over the  question,  such a risk would     have to be accepted.   An agreed treaty renders the probability of a  really     hostile Egypt more remote.&quot; I understand that this matter  has still to be  discussed by  the Committee  of Imperial Defence, after which a decision  by His Majesty&apos;s Government will be necessary.     7.  It will  be  observed that as regards the three stages  laid down in the original  instructions sent to His Majesty&apos;s High  Commissioner, Stage C has already been reached and  that the possibility of moving beyond Stage C  is under consideration.     8.  But I should like  to point out that the conversations have  been developing in such a way that to proceed beyond Stage C  does not necessarily involve the abandonment of a  position considered  essential by  His Majesty&apos;s Government, or at  any  rate  its abandonment without compensating  and   countervailing advantages in other directions.  It does not necessarily mean that His Majesty&apos;s Government will have  embarked on a facile descent, but rather  that they may be able to reach  their objective by another route.     9.  The offers made by Nahas Pasha referred to  above, and the point reached in respect of  them may now be examined.     10.   The offers which Nahas Pasha had made as stated above were :  (1) Road and  rail  communications  provided  to   the  satisfaction  of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government;  (2) an increased number  of British  troops in  the Canal Zone; (3) air facilities in the Western Desert;  and (4) compliance in these and  othermatters with the advice of  a British Military Mission.  He accompanied  theseproposals with the statement that the British forces could stay in their presentposition until the international crisis came to an end,  and with the reminder that, in any case, they would stay where they were  until alternative  accommodationwas  provided for them in  the Canal Zone, which must take several years.  Theseproposals  contemplated, as  will be seen,  the evacuation of Cairo and also ofAlexandria at a  time which would be dependent on the state of  affairs in Europe and the period required for the provision of new barracks in the Canal Zone, andnot on the time at which, to the mutual satisfaction of both parties, the Egyptian army might be in an adequate state of efficiency to take over from the British army responsibility for the defence of those  cities.  The questions  of the continuedoccupation of Cairo and Alexandria were discussed at sejjarate times during the discussions.  The position  reached as regards Cairo has been dealt with above, but it might be added here that Nahas Pasha has definitely stated (on the 16th April),      [13120]                                                     B 2
 with  regard to  the  proposal  to station troops at  Helouan  in  substitution for Cairo, that the Egyptian people would never be able to understand or acquiesce in the change of site, which they would regard  as an even more pronounced form of perpetuation  of the present occupation.  Rather than  that he would, indeed, prefer that the British forces should stay where they were pending the fulfilment of the  conditions just  mentioned.   Sir Miles  Lampson gave the Pasha  no encouragement to think that His Majesty&apos;s Government would yield  on this point, but has recommended to me that the proposal under Stage  C should be abandoned since among other reasons the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief regarded Helouan as unsuitable for the requirements of the Royal Air Force.     11.  In the  discussions with regard to Alexandria, Nahas Pasha has so far maintained his objections to the retention of a  British garrison in that City. He has maintained that, with increased forces in the Canal Zone and improved East- West  connexions, His Majesty&apos;s Government would have all they could reasonably require, and that Egyptian forces in Alexandria, even  if not properly trained, could  hold  the position adequately at Alexandria and in the  Western desert for the short period required and until the arrival of British reinforcements  from the Canal,  should  they  be  necessary.   From  the  discussions  regarding Alexandria emerged  the  fact that  the difficulty was to define the period for its evacuation  by British troops.   The Egyptians cannot admit that this could be dependent upon a Clause to the effect that both sides were satisfied that Egyptian troops were sufficiently trained and equipped to take over.  This would be inter- preted generally  in Egypt as a  loophole for enabling British troops to stay in any given  locality regardless  of time-limit on  the pretext that the  Egyptian troops were not yet fit to take over.   The  question remains at this point and efforts are being  made to find means of meeting this difficulty.  Sir Miles Lampson has been asked  whether, in his opinion,  the  Egyptians might  agree  to a provision stating that the British  troops would  remain until  the Egyptian Army was  fit to take over (no mention  being made as to the necessity of the mutual satisfaction of both parties on this point), any dispute on the subject being left for settlement under a general dispute clause.   Sir Miles Lampson has replied that it is possible, though by no  means certain,  that Nahas Pasha would  agree to this.    It has also  been proposed that, as a result of the total evacuation of the Cairo  area, Nahas Pasha might  be persuaded to agi^ee to the  inclusion  of  the phrase  &quot; to the mutual satis- f action of both parties &quot; on the ground that  the concession over Cairo would enable him to take Egyptian public opinion with him.    12.  The discussions on the offers of  Nahas have produced from him  pro- posals  as regards  training facilities for the Army, which, I understand, offer fair prospects of satisfying the requirements of  the War Office.   They include an offer of more extensive areas for training.  There is  a provision by which the troops  in the Canal Zone  will be enabled at specified periods of the year to cross the Delta and train in the Western Desert.  Besides  the new and improved com- munications from East  to West, which he originally suggested,  Nahas Pasha is ready  also to improve communications running North-West, North-East, East and possibly also  South from Cairo.    13.  Facilities for  the Air Force, which the Pasha  has so far suggested,though in a considerable measure satisfactory, are, it is understood,  not yet  con- sidered entirely to fulfil the requirements of the Air Ministry.  There is, however, reason to hope that it will be  possible to secure our full  desiderata so long aswording can be found which will not offend  the Egyptian amour-propre on  the question of  sovereignty.   Nahas Pasha seems  ready to  furnish His  Majesty&apos;s Government with all  that they  require in this respect.    14.  The question of access to  Egyptian Ports has so far caused a certain amount of difficulty.  In the Draft Treaty of 1930 (Article 8) Egypt was to afford to  this country in the event of  war or imminent menace of war, amongst other things, the use of  her ports.  It  is now desired to secure the right to use Egyptianports in the  event of &apos;&apos; an apprehended emergency.&apos;&apos;  Nahas has shown suspicion of  the motives of Flis Majesty&apos;s Government in putting forward this proposal, andhas suggested that it would be sufficient in case of an  apprehended emergency forHis Majesty&apos;s Government to despatch the Royal Navy to Egyptian ports as amatter of course in the manner in which they are accustomed to do now.  After
arrival the  apprehended  emergency  would  be  explained,  and  the necessary facilities and permission to remain would be accorded.  This does not meet our requirements and methods  of settling the  difficulty are under discussion.  One ofthese would be to insert in  the Article of the treaty under which Egypt promisesto come to the aid of this country as an ally, and to accord all the facilities in herpower, including the use of her ports in the event of war or imminent menace ofwar, a phrase to cover &quot; an apprehended emergency.&quot;     15.  But the  most important offer made by  Nahas  Pasha  is that he  has agreed  to  a formula  according to  which  (a) the  normal peace  time  british garrison in Egypt would  be (1) up  to 10,000 land troops; (2)  400  pilots and ancillary personnel for administrative and technical duties, with (&amp;)  a right onthe part of  His Majesty&apos;s  Government to reinforce without limit in  the case ofapprehended emergency and before a state of acute crisis is reached. I under-stand that the figures  here mentioned meet the requirements of  the  War  Officeand the Air Ministry  respectively, while the right of reinforcement meets  therecommendations of the Chiefs  of Staff as set down in paragraph 39 (i) (a) oftheir report of the  5th February, 1936 (see CP. 25  (38)).  I should add here thatit will no  doubt be considered  necessary to  find means  of ensuring that HisMajesty&apos;s Government  are  left the judges of what constitutes an &quot; apprehendedemergency.&quot;     16.  While, therefore,  His Majesty&apos;s Government have been unable to secure acceptance of their proposals under stages A,  B and C of their original instruc-tions to His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner, they have in other directions securedoffers from the leader of the Egyptian delegation which are of considerable value and which in some  respects  transcend what had been expected.     17.  I would recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should  decide  notto insist upon the stationing of British troops at Helouan in place of Cairo,  butthat, provided they can secure Egyptian agreement to the retention of  the british garrison at Alexandria, that they can reach a satisfactory solution of the questionof a time-limit for the maintenance  of a  garrison at Alexandria,, that they can obtain their requirements with regard to air facilities and army training, andthat they can secure that they remain the judges of an apprehended emergency;provided also that  they secure Egyptian agreement on  another highly important matter with which I deal  immediately below, they should agree  forthwith towithdraw  the British troops from Cairo  to the Canal  Zone and close with  the offers made by Nahas Pasha.     18.  Reference has just been made  to  an important  point on which it isnecessary to secure the  agreement of  the Egyptian  Government.  This point maybe referred to generally as our requirements in the matter of the duration of  thetreaty;  this description, however, is  not accurate because  its military provisionsmay really be divided into four headings, and there is no a priori reason why  the duration of all these four  classes of provisions should be  the same.   The fourheadings are:       (a) The stationing of British troops in parts of Egypt other than the Canal          Zone;     (&amp;) The stationing of British troops and  air forces in the Canal  Zone;     (c) The alliance between Egypt and the United Kingdom, which  means that          in  time of  war or emergency Egypt  has  to  place  her  ports and          communications at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government; and     (d) The recognition of the right of His Majesty&apos;s  Government (possibly not          to the exclusion of Egypt possessing a  similar right) to protect  the           Canal (i.e., to exercise the  role which, under article 9 of the Suez Canal          Convention, is accorded to Egypt and Turkey).In previous draft treaties (d) was left to be assumed, but a recent more  exhaustiveexamination of the legal position has led  to the conclusion that it wrould not  be safe to leave this position to be assumed, and the Chiefs of Staff  in their reportof the 9th April (OLD. Paper  No.  1228-B) have put it forward as  their viewthat the most essential  provision for  the treaty to contain  is one by which Egyptrecognises that His Britannic Majesty possessed  right (d) antecedently to thetreaty and shall possess it in perpetuity.       T13120]                                                     B 3
     19.   As already stated, point (d) having not been covered by any express provision in the 1930 or 1933 draft treaties, and point (a) not being a requirement which was inserted in those drafts at all, the duration of the treaty in the 1930 and 1933 drafts really meant the duration of provisions (b) and (c).  Sir Miles Lampson has repeatedly stated  his  view that he considers there  is no chance whatever of the negotiations being  successful unless the  treaty contains  some time limit (i.e., he is referring here to a time limit to provisions (b) and (c) ), that is to say, a clause under which these provisions go on for a certain number of years as a minimum, but that  after the expiry of the minimum period a third party (e.g., such as the Council of the League of Nations) is to decide in case of disagreement  between the contracting parties  whether these provisions are to continue unchanged,  and, if not, in what manner they are to be revised.     20.   As regards  point (d) and the view of the Chiefs of Staff, it is necessary, I think, that  it should be realised (1) that a  treaty provision carrying out the Chiefs of Staffs suggestion in the clearest and most obvious words would stand DO  chance of being  accepted by the Egyptian negotiators,  and  (2) that His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s present  claim to possess this right does not rest legally upon an absolutely secure basis.  At  the present moment His Majesty&apos;s  Govern- ment have for the rights which  they claim  merely a good arguable case.   In a letter  addressed to  the Admiralty, War Office  and  Air  Ministry  I  have suggested what I considered to be the best method of dealing with this matter. Briefly,  my  suggestions  are (i) that  there  should  be  in  the   body  of  the treaty a sentence to the  effect that Egypt, recognising His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s position  in  relation  to the  Suez Canal,  recognises that  he may,  through the Commanders of his forces  in Egypt, take such measures  as are  necessary for the protection of the  Canal, and  (ii) at the end of the treaty the duration article dealing with points  (6)  and (c)  should state that these provisions go .on  for a minimum of x years  and that after  this period they may  be replaced  by other provisions, but  that  these  provisions must provide for  the  position  of His Britannic Majesty in relation to  the Suez Canal and the safety of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s imperial communications.   The effect of these provisions would be that,even if a third party at the end of the minimum period had to decide in case of disagreement how the treaty  was  to be revised,  it must be already  accepted as a basis for the new treaty that it must provide for His  Britannic Majesty&apos;right to protect the Canal and those provisions must be such as to render Britishimperial communications secure,  though  the particular povisions of  points (a), (b)  and (c)  might be altered.    As regards (d) these suggestions  in my viewentirely meet the requirements put forward by the Chiefs of Staff.    21.  The  text of the letter to the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry, referred to above, is annexed.                                                                     A.

Reg. No. J 3027/G.(Most Urgent and Secret.)Sir,                                           Foreign Office, April 24, 1936.    I am directed by  Mr. Secretary Eden  to request you to inform the lords commissioners of the Admiralty/Army Council/Air Council that he has studiedthe report (C.O.S.  458) of the 9th April by the  Chiefs of Staff in regard to theinclusion of a  time-limit  in an Anglo-Egyptian treaty viewed particularly in thelight of the  responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United kingdom for the  protection  of the Suez Canal.  Mr. Eden desires to offer the following observations, which  he trusts will be examined by  the Committee of ImperialDefence at its  next meeting when it will have before it the Chiefs of Staffs reportabove mentioned.    2.  Their Lordships/The Army  Council/The Air Council will recall that myletter No. J 2667/2/16 of the 27th March contained certain specific proposals onthe question of the time-limit, and that my secret letter J 1816/G of the same datedealt with the question of the provisions necessary to secure the position of HisMajesty&apos;s Government  in relation to Article  9 of the Suez Canal Convention, withwhich the right to exercise control by martial law in the Canal Zone is connected.The report of the  Chiefs of Staff  under reference is based on the first  of these letters, and while it does not refer  in terms to the second, Mr. Eden assumes thatthe latter communication had been studied by the Chiefs of Staff, and was in their minds when they formed  their conclusions, of which the most salient appear to bethe following :      (a)  The right of  His Majesty&apos;s Government to protect the Canal (i.e., to          possess  the powers  given  under  Article  9  of  the Suez  Canal           Convention to Egypt and Turkey) must not be subject to a time limit.          His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot accept a position  in which,  after          a certain lapse of time,  it would rest with a  third party (e.g., the          League Council) to  decide  whether His Britannic Majesty should          continue  to possess this right, but:    (b)  If the treaty is so framed as to secure this right in a permanent form it          might not be essential, on strategic grounds,  to oppose the insertion in          the treaty of  provisions creating time limits for the various  military          arrangements.  These military arrangements are to be considered as          subordinate detailed  provisions settling, by agreement with Egypt as           the territorial Power, certain facilities which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-          ment are to possess  in order to assist them in  the exercise of the          general right to protect  the Canal.  The role of the naval forces in          this protection is predominant.    3.  My secret letter J  2731/G  also dealt with the general position of HisMajesty&apos;s Government  in relation to the protection of the Suez Canal.    This letter was not before the Chiefs of Staff when they wrote their report and, althoughdespatched after the date of that report, was, in fact, drafted without knowledgeof its terms.  Nevertheless, it anticipates the report to some extent, and  containsproj^proposals which  go some way to meet the Chiefs  of Staffs requirements.    4.  Mr. Edeifs present proposals are as follows :      (1)  to endeavour to secure the insertion of the following sentence in an article in the treaty permitting His Majesty&apos;s Government to station British forces inthe Canal Zone, viz. :          &quot; In view of  the position of His Britannic Majesty in relation to the    Suez Canal, His Majesty the King of  Egypt recognises that His Britannic    Majesty  may,  through  the Commanders  of  these  forces, take  all  steps    necessary for the maintenance  of the  security of, and of  the  freedom of    navigation in, the said Canal.&quot;,(This sentence was proposed in  paragraph  7 of Foreign Office letter  J 2731/G.)
    (2) to endeavour to secure the insertion, in the texts proposed in my letterJ 2667/2/16 (appendices 3 and 4 of the Chiefs of Staffs report), of a referenceto His Britannic Majesty&apos;s position in relation to the Suez Canal.  The objectof this reference is that the phrase in those texts which defines the aims of thefuture treaty (to be concluded after the expiration of the time limit of the presenttreaty)  should make it clear  that that future  treaty must  provide for thecontinued maintenance  of the position  of His  Britannic Majesty in relation tothe Suez  Canal  and  the  protection  in  all circumstances  of  his essentialcommunicati ons.    5.  Mr.  Eden is advised that the effect of these  two  provisions  would beas follows :     (a) The sentence quoted under (1) in the preceding paragraph would enable his Majesty&apos;s Government  to contend that  Egypt had  by it recognised theantecedent right  of His Britannic Majesty  to protect  the Suez  Canal, and  that,since  the treaty contemplated the continuation, under  the treaty regime, of this right  without stating that it ended simultaneously  with the treaty, it followed that Egypt had recognised that the right continued indefinitely.  It is true  that,as stated in  my letter No. 2731/G,  the proposed sentence  is (intentionally)ambiguous, and that Egypt might argue that the right was only being recognised for the first time and for the period of the treaty;  but, even so, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would, on  this article  alone, have an arguable legal case in favourof the position which the Chiefs of Staff regard as essential.   However (&amp;) the-suggested addition to the duration article (see paragraph 4 (2) ) should, if secured,put the position of His  Majesty&apos;s Government beyond  all reasonable doubt,  since it will mean that Egypt has agreed that the new treaty (to take  the place of thepresent treaty) must  continue to recognise His Britannic Majesty&apos;s position inrelation to the Suez Canal, and the sentence proposed under (1)  of the preceding paragraph shows that  &quot; His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s  position in  relation to the canal &quot; is that he has the right to maintain the security of the Canal and freedomof navigation therein. If  it should be found that the reference to &apos;&apos; the continuedmaintenance of the position of  His Britannic Majesty in  relation to the  suez canal &quot; and &quot; the protection in all circumstances of the essential communicationsof His Britannic Majesty&quot; is  more  than Egyptian negotiators can  accept,Mr. Eden would  conclude from the Chiefs of Staffs report that the first half isof greater importance than the second, although the latter covers air communica-tions  which can perhaps hardly be brought under the heading of  the protection ofthe Canal.    6.  Provided, however,  that  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  essential  positionin relation to  the Suez Canal is secured as proposed, Mr. Eden assumes from theChiefs  of  Staffs report  that  it  would not  be  impossible to  agree that theoccupation of  the Canal Zone by British land and air forces should be secured fora fixed period only, after which an outside body (e.g., the League Council) mighthave to decide in  case of dispute whether, and if so in what numbers, and in  whatplaces, it was necessary that they should remain in the Zone in order to enable his Britannic Majesty  efficiently to protect the Canal and his communications.    7.  Mr. Eden desires  to emphasise, and is anxious that  it should be realised,that so far as the fundamental  right to which the  Chiefs  of Staff attach  vitalimportance is concerned, the present legal position of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis far from unassailable (vide the memorandum enclosed in my letter J 1816 /Gand the comments of the  Judicial  Adviser  to  the Egyptian Government which accompanied my letter J 2731 /G).  Owing to the failure of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  ever to secure the  agreement of Egypt, and the express as opposed to theimplied (agreement of Turkey to this position,  they have in fact, at this moment,merely a good arguable  case and not an absolutely secure case.   If the proposalsnow  put  forward  were  to  be  realised, the  legal  position  of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, even after the termination of the fixed period of. the treaty, wouldbe infinitely stronger than at present, indeed,  probably unquestionable;  further,even if these proposals  were not realised in their entirety,  the  legal position ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government at that time might be at least as strong as it  is  now.So far as the fundamental position and the right to protect the Canal is concerned(viz.,  the rights under Article 9 of the Suez Canal Convention) Mr. Eden agrees
that it is essential that after the fixed, time-limit of the treaty, the claim of HisBritannic Majesty should rest on a legal foundation not less strong than that uponwhich it rests at present.  At the same  time the  difficulties of securing  a clear and  unambiguous recognition of that position in  a treaty with Egypt must, inhis view, be recognised, and he does not consider that the advantages of a treaty advantages which, are not merely political should  be lost in order to secure afterthe fixed period an unassailable case for the maintenance of the rights of HisMajesty&apos;s Government under Article 9 of the Suez Canal  Convention as opposedto a good arguable case which, as already indicated, is all that they possess atpresent.     8.
