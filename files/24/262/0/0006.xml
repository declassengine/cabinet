(,THIS-POCiI^liI Is THE PROPER IT OF HIS BRITANNIC MAOTSTYjS GOV^M^NT)                      0 A B I N E  T.secret.P.116^361^------            TRAFFIC J DRIVING- LICIiNCUS)  BILL.           MemorandumJog^the minister  of  Transport.             I  desire the authority of  the Cabinet  to  support   the Road Traffic (Driving Licences)  Bill introduced by a  Private   1 ember and shortly to be  considered  by  Standing  Committee &apos;B&apos;.             The Bill is  designed  to  remove certain difficulties   of  a limited  character arising  out of the Road Traffic Act,  1934.   It  is not  controversial  and  it  should he possible to take its   remaining  stages after 11  o&apos;clock.        Clause 1 relieves the  steersmen of vehicles subject  to  a   &quot;speed limit of  5 m,p,h.  from the necessity of  obtaining  the   special  licence  required by  drivers  of  heavy motor vehicles.   The majority  of  these men  are  engaged in connection with  the   vehicles of travelling showmen  and their primary occupation  is   that of  an attendant  on  the  fairground.   It is  stated  that   these men  seldom, if  ever,  have any  occasion to  drive a  motor   vehicle  in the  ordinary  sense,  as  their duty is  to turn the  wheel   of  a large tractor when  the  show is  moving from  one ground to   another, under  the orders  of a  qualified driver.   In these   circumstances  I  see  no objection to  relieving  them from the   obligation to obtain the special licence which is alleged to   create hardship.        Clause 2 provides  for the  issue of a provisional licence   to  enable  a man to  learn to  drive  a  heavy goods  vehicle.   As  the   1934 Act is drafted,  no  person may now legally drive one  of  these   vehicles until  he has obtained the special licence, which ought   normally only to be  given after the  man has passed a special   driving test.
24th April,  1956.          Subject to some detailed amendments which I may desire to move in Committee, the Bill is suitably drawn forits purpose.          If it be in order, I may also desire to add a clause giving me power to require a person who qualifies only as a motar cyclist to pass a further test before becomingentitled to a licence to drive a car or light lorry.-    Atpresent, while I have power to prescribe different tests fordriving different vehicles, the man who is qualified  on a motor cycle may nevertheless demand as a right a licenceentitling him to drive a car or a light lorry.                          L.  H - B.
