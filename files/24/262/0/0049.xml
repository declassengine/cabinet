Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1936.SECRET.                                                          Copy No.CP. 159 (36).CABINET.THE ITALO-ETHIOPIAN  DISPUTE.                                 SANCTIONS.           Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    IN deciding whether sanctions ought to be maintained or  removed by theLeague at its next meeting, His Majesty&apos;s Government will  have before them asa matter of general policy a choice between  the following courses :  1.  To maintain existing Sanctions, or even to extend them by the addition of the                                Oil  Embargo.    In the  first  place, are we  sure now that  an independent Abyssinia hasdisappeared that the  sanctions front can be maintained and  that it will not simply crumble, one country after another either openly or  covertly abandoningsanctions?   There are already symptoms of  this.   Will not such a  result be thevery one which Italy desires, since she will be able to negotiate with each in turn the economic and financial  arrangements necessary in order to  get trade goingagain,  instead  of having to deal with  all the  sanctionist Powers  in a unitedbloc ?   Further,  how  long is  it expected that  sanctions  will  have  to  bemaintained before their effect can become decisive ?   This is  a question on which only the most general and uncertain  estimates can be made.  A  separate reporton the  subject has been circulated (CP. 154).   If sanctions are not taken off now,what justification shall we find for raising them at a later stage?   Even if it is held that a decisive effect can be achieved after a still protracted period, it must berecognised that at the outset the continuance of sanctions will not  exercise, save asa slowly debilitating irritant, any great political  influence on Italian policy.Mussolini will be tempted  to play for time, as he has so successfully done hitherto,and the sanctionist Powers would almost certainly meet eventually with a furtherfailure.  In the contrary  event of the continuance  of  sanctions producing at anearly date a decisive effect on Italy&apos;s  financial and economic situation, the likelihood-hood must be faced that Mussolini would go  to war with this country.  On thispoint His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome has warned us.  And even without war,the prolongation  of sanctions would in that  case mean that  we shall have for  afurther indefinite period  to continue to bottle  up our forces  in  the  eastern mediterranean and  in Egypt.    As for the arguments in favour of continuance of sanctions,  these are fairlyclear.   The first derives from the view that it is necessary to show the world thataggression  does not succeed, and Italy  that she  cannot indefinitely  flout  the collective strength of the League.  It  is said that sanctions will secure the recog-nition by Italy of these facts, and therefore the concession of better terms by italy to the League.  This view receives strong reinforcement from the  contention thatif  Italian aggression succeeds on this occasion, Italian intrigue and blackmail       8656   [13344]                                                B
and even aggression will be exercised against us in our own African spheres of influence and possessions and elsewhere in the Mediterranean, and in central europe and the Balkans generally.  It is further supported by the claim that, ifan Italian aggressor succeeds, other aggressors will be encouraged.    Against this,  three  objections suggest  themselves.    First,  Abyssinia  nolonger exists as a political entity and would have to be recreated : and this couldonly be done with the help  of military  forces adequate  to  support the new administration.  Secondly, no such  solution, which postulates the cancellation ofthe new Italian Empire, is conceivable without the collapse of the Fascist regime in Italy preceded almost certainty by a last throw by Mussolini in the form of awar against the sanctionist  States or  some of them.   This course could onlytherefore be embarked upon  if we were absolutely  certain of the ability andwillingness  of France to collaborate  in  repelling  an  Italian attack  in  theMediterranean and elsewhere, and if we  were sure that Germany and&apos;japan would not seize  the opportunity of our being otherwise engaged to, disturb thestatus quo elsewhere to their own advantage.  Thirdly, Sir E. Drummond suggests(in his despatch No. 522 E. of the 30th April) that Italy&apos;s  financial position when she has to turn her  industries back to normal civil work and to reabsorb her armyinto civil life may  be  such that she will be unable to undertake any great newenterprise against anyone, particularly if she continues to incur in Abyssinia the trouble and expense that we anticipate.    If, therefore, the League were successfully to maintain sanctions to the bitterend, this would in effect mean for us the pursuit of a policy which would sooner or later provoke Italy  into armed retaliation and allow us to fight partly for ourown ends what would,  in effect, be from one point of view a preventive war underthe auspices of the League; though we should do it of course with the support ofother Members of the League like Greece and Turkey whose independence (no lessthan our own Imperial interests) would be at stake.    But we must also ask ourselves what would be the real advantage to us of the collapse of  Italy.   On the one  hand,  we  might,  at  any  rate  temporarily, freeourselves of the threat of a fresh Italian venture in the Mediterranean or north africa; and we may  well have eventual trouble with Italy in  Egypt and theSudan. On  the other hand, it  could be argued that we should have weakenedan important counter-weight to Germany in Central  and  South-Eastern Europe.    Again,  the course of continuing sanctions would only  be possible, or evendesirable from the League point of view,  if the French Government is preparedwhole-heartedly to  collaborate.  If both France and the  United Kingdom wereunited in support of such a policy, it would probably be supported  to a sufficientextent by the other Members of the League who matter. But it is difficult to thinkthat the indispensable condition of French collaboration  could ever be fulfilled.And this holds good, notwithstanding the recent change of Government in France,for French thought, irrespective of internal politics, is dominated by the Germandanger and by the heavy risk of German action under cover of a League war with italy in the Mediterranean.    Moreover, if sanctions are maintained, we  must  face not only the fact thatMussolini will carry  out his threat and  leave the  League, but  also the risk that he will come to some understanding with Hitler.  On this point we have hadserious warnings from His Majesty&apos;s  Ambassador in Berlin.  It is easy to saythat joint designs on Austria render a German-Italian understanding impossible;but  common  dissatisfaction  has made stranger  partners.   The  systems  andappetites  of both  dictators are similar, and they  have now a common interestin  extra-European  expansion.   Moreover,  in  order  that the  two  dictatorsmay in practice support each other, it is  unnecessary for them  to come to  anyexpress arrangement with regard to the one point which separates them, namely,Austria.   Their very co-existence  achieves this end, for each of  them by his presence immobilises a great part of the collective strength which might be rangedagainst the other.     The second argument in favour of the continuance of sanctions is that theauthority of the League ought to be maintained.  It is evident that if sanctionsare abandoned, and Italy escapes with her booty in spite  of  the disapproval  and opposition of the League, the prestige and usefulness of the latter for the future will be greatly affected.   And it may also  be maintained  that the Italian decreeof annexation has brought Article  X to the fore and that sanctions ought to bemaintained by reason of that Article to prevent the absorption  of one State
 member by  another.  On the other hand, it is doubtful whether the prestige of the League  would be raised if  sanctions peter out owing to successive defections or cupidities, and whether the continuance of sanctions could in fact attain the objects of Article X in this case.  The question must here arise and be answered whether  the League  can be more  effectively revitalised if sanctions were now admitted to have failed to achieve their object  on  this occasion and removed by common agreement with a view to reforming the League on some  more effective and realistic basis.  Were this course attempted, it might though this must be doubtful be possible to compel those Powers who have talked most about  and contributed  least to  collective  security  to  face  their real responsibilities in a system from which they stand  to gain so much.    The third  argument  in  favour of the maintenance of  sanctions is  the embarrassment which their removal might be expected to cause for His Majesty&apos;s Government at home.   On first  consideration  it  might be  thought that  the maintenance of sanctions would be of some considerable assistance to the Govern- ment;  but on more mature reflection it is not clear that this would  necessarily be the case.  There is a strong body of opinion in this country which now favours the abandonment of sanctions,  and that body of opinion would be strengthened were it possible to accompany their abandonment (a) by a demonstration on our part that we were not abandoning those  Mediterranean countries who had promised us armed support during the enforcement of sanctions, and  that we were taking effective measures to  restore our authority in the Mediterranean generally; (6) by proposals for the reform of  the  League; (c) by  undertakings from Italy with regard to her future policy in Africa, the Mediterranean and Central and South-Eastern Europe.   2.  To raise Sanctions while maintaining the Condemnation of Italy and            Non-recognition of the Italian Annexation of A abyssinia.    The raising of sanctions  could be  explained by the fact  that, having been applied for  a certain purpose,  namely, the repression of war  in violation of the Covenant, they had failed of that purpose.  The measures chosen had been those which  could be  effectively applied  by Members of the League alone, and were also such as  were not likely to provoke  armed retaliation by the  Covenant-breaking State.  It had been assumed  that  the  course of the military  campaign would be such as to give time for the measures adopted to produce  their effect on the aggressor.   This had been based on a miscalculation.  The campaign had been concluded before the full effect of sanctions had been exercised.   It  was therefore not practical politics to continue them.    In lifting sanctions, the question will arise whether this action would be accompanied by  one or more of the  following measures :  (a)  Maintenance of the Condemnation of Italy.    It ought not to be impossible to devise a suitable formula  which the Council.or Assembly might adopt, without expelling Italy from the League. (b)  Non-recognition of the Italian Conquest of A abyssinia.    This will be more difficult  for us to maintain than in the  Manchurian case.Both Great Britain and France have colonies adjoining Abyssinia, and will haveto maintain  relations with the frontier authorities, customs, &amp;c.  France has theJibuti  railway, in regard to which  agreements  with Italy will have to be made. Sooner or later we shall have to attend to the subject of Lake Tsana.   The Italian Government may also soon wish to re-accredit  its diplomatic  representatives  in the name  of the King of Italy, Emperor  of  Abyssinia,  and  to  have  foreign representatives re-accredited to  him.    On the  other hand, to recognise at once  would  be bitterly unpopular  atGeneva,  and  is  not   expected  by   Italy.    Fortunately  on   the  occasion of  the  forthcoming  Geneva   meeting  it  ought  to be  possible to  take  adecision to  remove  sanctions  without  the  League having  straight away  to pronounce itself on the question of recognition.   This  could well  and with advantage keep till the Assembly in September, by which time  the situation willhave clarified and Mussolini will have  had time to reveal his intentions and      .[13344],                                    .   :        &apos;&apos;.    b 2
decide&apos; his policy as regards the League generally.  We must remember incidentallythat&apos; the&apos; experience  of  Manchukuo  has taught  us that hon-recognitioh is awasting&apos; asset.(c) Expulsion of Italy from the League.     This could be blocked by one vote on the Council, e.g., Ecuador.  It may alsobe supposed that if France will not collaborate in maintaining sanctions, she willbe equally  averse to expelling Italy from Geneva, her object in both cases being to &quot; keep Italy in  Europe.&quot;  It might be argued that the League would be better able to save itself if it were composed solely of Members  who  were likely toremain faithful, to its principles and observe their  engagements.  On the otherhand,  the  expulsion of  Italy might  well be  followed  by  some  sort  ofcoalescence  between  Italy and Germany  in Europe.   This  would  complicate the  question of Germany  rejoining  the League,  and a  League  without eitherGermany or Italy would be near an absurdity.   Expulsion would in fact be abrutum fulmen.   It would  achieve  little,  and what it did  achieve would be undesirable.(d) Reconsideration  of  the  structure  of the League  in the light of recent         experience.     This is a vast  and very delicate question which is now being studied.   It willbe impossible to have anything ready to put before the Cabinet, and still lessbefore the  League, before the meeting at  the end  of the month.   But it may allthe same be desirable to make it clear that in our view immediate steps shouldbe taken by Members of  the League to study individually how the Covenant can best be applied henceforth in the light of recent experience.(e) Undertaking by Italy with regard to her future policy in  Africa, the Medi-         terranean, and  Central and  south-Eastern Europe.     If Mussolini  could  be induced to make some declaration on these  subjects to the  League or, if that is not obtainable, in some public and official manner -it would certainly  facilitate the removal of sanctions although, of course, there could  not  be  any  bargain between  the League  and Italy  on the subject.  Asuggestion in this sense has been conveyed  to Mussolini through the  italian ambassador in London, but there has been no response so far.(f) Demonstration by His Majesty&apos;s  Government  that they are not abandoning         those Mediterranean countries who had promised them armed support         during the enforcement of sanctions, and  that they zuere taking effective         measures  to  restore their authority in the Mediterranean generally.     These two ideas are developed in a paper which is being circulated separately.(g) Consideration  of any measures to  be taken  by  the  appropriate means at         Geneva to  secure  as far as  possible that no country  is  victimised         economically for the action which it has taken under Article XVI.     There  remains the question of  procedure.     Whatever policy  we decide on,  we can either      (a) Advocate it singlehanded at Geneva;     (b) Try beforehand  to obtain France&apos;s concurrence with the object of joint           action at Geneva;     (c) Try beforehand to reach an arrangement with Italy;    (d) Leave the  initiative  to  others  at  Geneva,  and accept  whatever  the           majority propose, even if this should result in  a further adjournment           of any decision.    It will, I think,  be generally felt  that of these courses (a) is the one most in keeping with the dignity and responsibilities of this country.   The initiative andvirility in the conduct of League  affairs has been in our hands; it is better, both for His Majesty&apos;s Government and the League, that it should remain there ratherthan that His Majesty&apos;s Government should  seem  to  be acquiescing in somegeneralised but amorphous movement  behind the scenes, or even following in  thewake of some South American State or  M. Litvinoff which might otherwise be
the.ease. ; Whatever decision&apos; therefore ,my colleagues may,reach, I propose thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should make an announcement of their policy without previous consultation either with the French or the  Italian or indeed with  any foreign Government.  I would, moreover, be in  favour of making this announce-ment in the first place in the House of Commons.  For this purpose I annex adraft statement for use in  the event of  its being decided that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should recommend the immediate  raising of  sanctions,  this beingthe course which in existing circumstances I favour.  It will be observed that thelast three paragraphs of this  statement  provide for  a demonstration by  HisMajesty&apos;s Government as suggested  in (/) above to  the effect that they are notabandoning  those   Mediterranean countries who had  promised them armedsupport during the enforcement of sanctions.                                                                    A. E.    June 11, 1936.
                                  ANNEX.                 Draft Statement for the House of Commons.     ON the 7th October last, fourteen members of the Council  found that Italy had resorted  to war against Abyssinia  in disregard  of her obligations under Article 16 of the Covenant.  A few days later this finding was confirmed by some fifty Members of the League at a meeting of the Assembly.   The Members of the  League then proceeded in common, in  virtue of  their obligations under Article 16 of the Covenant, to apply certain measures of an economic and financial character against the Covenant-breaking State.  It was hoped that the influence of these measures might serve to bring about a cessation of the conflict and to promote a just settlement of the dispute.  This hope has, however, been falsified. The Abyssinian resistance has collapsed.   The capital and the greater part of the country are in Italian military occupation, and the Emperor is not participating in any way, actively or passively, in the furtherance of hostilities.     This is the situation with which we are now faced, and I would  not wish to conceal its gravity.  For  a variety of reasons the  League has  not succeeded in averting the  outbreak of  this war, or in preventing the successful issue of the Italian campaign.     It may be urged that the  Members  of the League should have  taken more effective steps  to achieve their purpose.   I  have  the  greatest  respect  for  the sentiments and convictions  of  those who press  this argument.  But it  may be appropriate to repeat here two considerations which have weighed with  the Members  of  the  League  in deciding in what manner the obligations under Article 16 could best be fulfilled.     The first is that the absence from the League of a  number of  Great Powershas  gravely  circumscribed, the power  of Members of  the  League to applyeffectively the economic and financial pressure for which Article 16 provides.  The steps taken were the maximum upon which common agreement could, in practice,be reached, and they were, in actual fact,  such  as could most effectively be applied by Members of the League alone, without the collaboration of non-Member States. It is common knowledge that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom were active in securing the adoption of the measures actually applied, and theyrepeatedly declared themselves ready  to participate in  any further measures ofa financial and economic character which might be agreed upon.   But  in viewof the  course which events have actually taken,  it is difficult to credit that any economic and financial measures alone would have developed their effects in timeto bring about the full result desired.    The second consideration is this.  As regards measures other than economicand  financial,  Governments were bound to ask themselves, with a  full sense ofresponsibility, whether it would be justifiable, in the present political and militarysituation  of the world, to take action which  might be expected to involve  theextension of the area of war to the European continent, with all the incalculableconsequences  that  modern warfare  entails.   It  is thus hardly a matter  for surprise that  no proposal involving the use  of  force was put  forward  by anyMember of the League, and there is no reason to suppose that any such proposal would ever have been accepted by the League.   &apos;    Although the action of the League has not availed  to prevent the successfulaccomplishment of a violation of the Covenant, His Majesty&apos;s Government do  notregret that the attempt was made.  In his speech at the  Assembly last september the representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United  Kingdom, afteroutlining in words that have even greater force to-day the difficulties under whichthe League was working, declared that, in spite of these difficulties, His Majesty&apos;s Government would  be second to none in  their intention  to  fulfil,  within  themeasure of their capacity, the  obligations which the Covenant  lays upon them. That was a pledge which His Majesty&apos;s Government have endeavoured faithfullyto fulfil.  They have, in common with their fellow-Members of the League,  appliedall those measures upon which general agreement could  be reached.  They did so in the hope that their action would be effective in the present case and serve as astrong  deterrent for the future.
    There remains  the  question  of the steps  now to be taken.   The whole situation, including the continued  application  or  otherwise  of economic  andfinancial sanctions, will be considered by the Members of the League when theAssembly meets at the end of this month.  It cannot be foreseen what view willbe taken by the various Governments concerned, but His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfor their part, after mature consideration, are inevitably driven to the conclusionthat there is no  longer  any utility in  continuing  these measures as  a meansof pressure upon  Italy.  It cannot be anticipated that the continued applicationof these measures would restore the  position that has been destroyed, and if nottheir continued application would, we feel, merely serve to perpetuate a state ofsterile  tension in an  already  anxious  international situation without in factsecuring in the  present  case  the objects  of the Covenant.   It seems  to  HisMajesty&apos;s Government, therefore,  that  the  more prudent, the more honest  andcourageous course would  be for the Members of the  League, without in.any wayreceding from the opinion they expressed about the character of  Italy&apos;s actionlast October, to  agree, when the Assembly meets,  to make  a clean cut  and to terminate the  action  they  have taken under Article 16.  Any decision  on thequestion whether sanctions should be raised, and if so on what date, must, ofcourse, be a collective one, but I have thought it right to inform the House of theviews of His Majesty5s Government.    It is not anticipated that  the Assembly5s present session could usefully dealwith the future of  the League itself.  That is a matter which it would, in my view,  be  wiser to  leave  until  the  Assembly meets in  ordinary  session  nextSeptember.  But  whatever the Assembly may decide to do at its  forthcoming meeting, it is  clear that the machinery  of the League requires to  be inspectedand overhauled.   The application of the Covenant  during the last few months has revealed shortcomings, unrealities,  even dangers.  We must see that theseare avoided in the future.   The clean cut should be the beginning of a fresh start,in the  sense that we must all  turn  our minds actively to the solution of these problems, and  it  is our intention after  consultation  with the  Dominion Govern-ments to formulate a  policy for the future.  We are  already actively engagedupon this task.    There is a further matter  connected with this question to which I wish torefer.  The House will recall  that last December exchanges of view took place between   His   Majesty5s  Government  and   the   Governments   of  certainMediterranean  countries  in  regard to collaboration  in  resistance to  special measures of a  military character which might be aimed at one of them in viewof the fact that that State was collaborating in economic and financial measuresunder Article  16.  As a  result of these exchanges of view,  certain reciprocalassurances were exchanged. Papers on this subject have already been laid.    It is the view of the Government and it will, I am sure,  be the view of theHouse, that these  assurances which have been given by this country should not endwith the raising  of sanctions.   The countries concerned may reasonably  expect that the same assurances of assistance should be considered to cover  the period of uncertainty which  must  necessarily follow the termination  of action  underArticle 16. Should, therefore, the League decide to raise sanctions, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment intend, with a view to the establishment of confidence in the regionsconcerned, to give such assurances in due and formal manner at Geneva.  I needhardly  say that the Government regard the eventuality which the assurance would cover as  being not only hypothetical, but improbable.   Moreover, obviously this assurance would  be intended to operate only so  long as, in the opinion of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, it remained appropriate to the circumstances.  But within these limits it is  their view that these assurances should be given,  and they  areprepared to give them.
