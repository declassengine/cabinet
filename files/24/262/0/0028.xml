Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1936.137SECRET.Copy  No.CP. 138 (36).CABINET.PALESTINE.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I CIRCULATE with this memorandum     (1)  A copy of my private and personal telegram to Sir Arthur Wauchope of          the 13th May;    (2)  A copy of Sir Arthur Wauchope&apos;s reply of the 14th May;    (3)  A copy of my reply to (2) of the 14th May; and    (4)  A copy of a telegram from the High Commissioner of the 14th May giving          the text of the reply received  by him from the Arab Council of Ten,          which is  referred to in  paragraph 2 of  his  private  and personal          telegram of the 14th May  at (2).    2.   It will be observed that, in the exercise of the discretion which was givento him,  the High Commissioner ha,s communicated confidentially  to  leaders ofopinion in Palestine  the terms of the Governments decision to appoint a RoyalCommission, as recommended by Sir Arthur  &quot;Wauchope, conditionally upon lawand order having been  first  re-established.  The Arab leaders, however,  havestated that the Arab people will not agree to end the  strike on the basis of thisproposal, as the policy of the Arab people is to  continue the strike until the BritishGovernment introduces a  fundamental change  in its  present  policy which willmanifest itself in stoppage of Jewish  immigration.   The attitude taken up bythe Arabs  clearly indicates that the  proposal which the High  Commissionerconsidered  might mitigate  the situation in  Palestine would be  ineffectual.Furthermore, it constitutes a direct challenge to British authority, more especiallyhaving regard  to the fact that  the  High  Commissioner himself  has definitelyinformed the Arab leaders that he cannot recommend that their demand shouldbe acceded to for a temporary stoppage of  immigration.    3.   It appears that the only course now open to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis to set out clearly the original intention to receive an Arab deputation and the subsequent proposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government  for the appointment of a RoyalCommission, conditionally upon  law and order having been first re-established,and the fact that both these offers have been rejected by the Arab leaders, andto state that in these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government have no alternativeopen to  them but to make it perfectly clear that, while always ready to listen toany grievances voiced either by Arabs  or by  Jews, it is their firm intention todischarge to the full their responsibilities for Palestine,  and to carry out  theirmandatory obligations in respect both of  Arabs and of Jews  undeterred by anyattempts to deflect their  policy by  means of threats  of  violence or  of  civildisobedience.   Before, however, any public statement is made,  it appeared to mato be very important  to ascertain  from Sir Arthur Wauchope whether  he seesany objection  to it  containing  a reference  to the  fact  that he has  already communicate  confidentially to the Arab leaders the  Governments conditionalproposal for the appointment of  a Royal  Commission.   I have therefore sent animmediate telegram,  to Sir Arthur  Wauchope, and I hope  that  I shall  havereceived his reply before the Cabinet meets on  Monday.(Initialled)J. H.

ANNEX.                                     (1)   Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the                     High Commissioner for Palestine.                        (Sent 6 P.M. 13th May, 1936.)    MOST Immediate.  Private and Personal.    Your private and personal telegram of 12th May.  Whole situation has beenconsidered by Cabinet, who place implicit trust in you and your judgment as tolocal situation, which you,  being on the spot,  are in best position to appreciate.They  are prepared to accept your recommendation for  appointment of RoyalCommission,  which, without in any way bringing into question the terms of theMandate, will investigate causes of unrest and alleged grievances either of Arabsor Jews.    In order, however, to avoid appearance of yielding  to violence, the  Cabinetconsider  it essential  that  it should  be  laid  down that civil  order must  bere-established before the appointment is made.    You can use your own discretion as to how you communicate the terms of theGovernments decision confidentially to leaders of opinion in Palestine, bearing that mind the indispensable conditions mentioned above.    It will be necessary to make public  announcement at the earliest possible date,and not  later than Friday, of the Governments intentions simultaneously  inPalestine and in the House of Commons.    In  making announcement  it  appears  desirable,  after  declaration  thatcessation of disturbances must precede  appointment of Commission, to state thatdecision was arrived at in  view of obvious impracticability of original proposalfor Arab Deputation and necessity for Enquiry into recent events and their causes.    Precise terms of  reference and personnel must be very carefully considered and must be decided later in consultation with you.   Should  be  glad in themeantime to  have  any observations upon the procedure suggested that you may wish to offer.                                    (2)   Paraphrase Telegram from the  High Commissioner for Palestine to the                    Secretary of State for the Colonies.                           Dated 14th May, 1936.                    (Received 8&apos;48 P.M. 14th May, 1936.)    MOST Immediate.  Private and personal.    I highly appreciate the trust which you  and Cabinet repose in me.  I alsowelcome  the  decision to  appoint  a Royal Commission, which,  within  the framework of the terms of the Mandate, will investigate the causes of unrest inPalestine and the  grievances voiced by  the  Arabs and the Jews.  I  fully agreethat,  before  the Royal  Commission can  be  appointed,  civil order  must  bere-established.    2.  I communicated His Majesty&apos;s Governments decision in strict confidence to Arab  Council of Ten this morning, and also  separately to one or two Mayorsand leading Arabs, outside politics.    They all gave  the same reply. They said that they are powerless, in view ofthe strength of public opinion  all over the country, to call off the strike, nor couldthey succeed in stopping acts of lawlessness unless I  could promise that,  tillRoyal Commission had made its report, there would be a  temporary cessation of immigration.   My immediately  following telegram  gives text of written reply which I  have received from the  Council of Ten this afternoon.
                                    (3)   Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the                     High  Commissioner for Palestine.                      (Sent 11-30 P.M. 14th May, 1936.)    IMMEDIATE.   Private and Personal.    Your telegram of  to-day, private and personal.   It will not be possible tomake an  announcement in House of Commons until after meeting of Cabinet onMonday.   We have only received as yet the first of your two telegrams of to-day&apos;date, and before framing announcement it will be necessary to consider both.   Weentirely approve of your attitude as reported in  paragraph 3.                                    (4)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State                             for the Colonies.                           Dated 14th May, 1936.                    (Received 9 - 55 P.M. 14th May, 1936.)    IMPORTANT.   NO. 222.    Following is the text of reply received from Council of Ten :      Begins:  With reference to statement which  your Excellency made thismorning to Supreme Arab Committee, regarding approval of Secretary of Stateof your proposal that a Royal Commission be sent to enquire into the causes of arab discontent with the present British policy, I have the honour to inform youas follows :      The Supreme Arab Committee has given careful study to your statement, andcame to the conclusion, after consideration thereof, that Arab  people will not agree to end the  strike on basis of this proposal, as policy of  Arab people atpresent is to  continue  the  strike  until the  British  Government introduces  a fundamental change in its present  policy which will manifest itself in stoppage of Jewish immigration.  Ends.    3.   In reply to Arab Leaders&apos; demand that immigration should be stoppeduntil after Royal Commission had reported, I have clearly stated that I cannot recommend holding up of this six months&apos; schedule or limitation of immigrationuntil after Royal Commission has made its report.    But in view of  the gravity of the  fact  that, unless some limitation  of immigration be made, I see no prospect at present of the strike ending or of anylessening of lawless acts, I  shall be glad to hear if you consider my reply to theArab Leaders embodies your views or if you consider advisable  any modificationof my reply.    4.   Text of announcement  which you will  make in the House of commons to-morrow will  be published here simultaneously, if you will telegraph it to me.
