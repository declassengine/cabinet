THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  May 1936.SECRET.                                                          Copy No.CP. 124  (36).CABINET.RELATIONS  WITH THE IRISH  TREE  STATE.     THE most serious aspect of inter-Imperial relations at present is the absenceof agreement between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State on variousimportant matters.  This state of affairs between the United Kingdom and a dominion is unsatisfactory in  itself, and inevitably tends to weaken  the moralauthority of the British Commonwealth of Nations in world affairs.  Moreover,if matters are allowed to drift, they may well end before long in  a more seriousbreach between the two countries.  On the other hand, I think the time has come when, despite  the  well-known difficulties, a careful effort to reconcile differences between the two countries has some prospect of meeting with success.  Even if anagreement proves impossible, I believe that our own people expect  the attempt tobe made, and  that the  Government will be  criticised if it does not in the  nearfuture take the initiative in promoting discussions.  Parliamentary and publicopinion are both showing increasing impatience with the present  situation.   Anearly agreement is all the more desirable in the light of the dangers of the present international situation, since a satisfactory settlement of  the  question  of  the defences of Southern Ireland would increase our security.  Moreover, the King&apos;sCoronation  will be  held next year,  and a reconciliation which  enabled  thePresident of the Irish Free State Executive Council, as well as the other dominion prime Ministers, to attend it would be timely and auspicious.     2.  I have therefore been giving  the problem careful  thought,  and have prepared this paper  for my colleagues&apos; consideration.     3.  I annex a  memorandum (Appendix 1) setting out the history of the recentdispute and the attempts hitherto made to reach a settlement.                           Methods of Approach.     4.   The matters in dispute cover  a wide field,  including  constitutional,defence, financial  and  trade relations.   I discuss later the terms on  which we might be willing to consider  a settlement of these. The question which first arisesis whether,  if we  have in view a general settlement,  this is most  likely to beachieved by tackling the principal outstanding issues one by one, attempting thesimpler ones (such as the financial issue) first, and approaching the more difficultones (such as the constitutional issue) only as the &apos;&apos; atmosphere &apos;&apos; between the twocountries improves, thus achieving a general settlement by degrees;  or whetherit is likely to be best accomplished in one set of comprehensive negotiations inwhich all the outstanding issues are considered  together.     5.   To some extent, at any rate, the former method may usefully be employed.Indeed, it has already been adopted.  The policy was successfully launched by my predecessor. The Coal-Cattle arrangement reached in December 1934 was a  firstvaluable  step towards  improving relations between the two countries,  and  thiswas  followed by the  more extensive trade arrangement concluded this February.The  good effect of these on mutual relations has been apparent and has encouraged the hopes of a  wider settlement which many people on both sides of  the IrishChannel  now   cherish.   During recent  months  we  have  also  entered  into
negotiations on other individual matters.  For example, we have arranged forsatisfactory  co-operation in the establishment of certain  specific air services between the &quot;Irish Free  State  and this country,  and  have also succeeded inassociating the  Irish Free State Government with  the Agreement reached at ottawa and  Washington for a Trans-Atlantic Air Service.   Discussions with aview to putting this Agreement into effect are proceeding satisfactorily.  We arealso negotiating on certain matters of less importance, such as the National StudFarm at Tully, and the operation in the Irish Free State of the Irish Sailors&apos; andSoldiers&apos; Land Trust.     6.  Some people have urged upon me that the  major  questions should be approached in the same way;  that  it  would be wise, for instance, to settle thefinancial dispute before attempting, to deal with the constitutional question.   ButI doubt whether these can be  satisfactorily dealt with piecemeal.   In  the firstplace, we ourselves have hitherto insisted  that there could be no settlement of thefinancial and economic questions without a general political agreement, and  there seems no new reason for adopting  another  attitude now.   Secondly,  from thepractical point of view, any agreement must depend on a certain amount of &quot; giveand take &quot; between  the two sides, and it is difficult to see where the conditions for  this exist if the various  questions are dealt  with  separately.   On theconstitutional issues we  ourselves  cannot  &quot; give &quot;  much  more  than  we  havealready given; above all, we must insist on a proper recognition of the positionof the Crown in the Irish Free State Constitution.  Mr.  de Valera will  haveto do most of the &quot; giving &quot; in this particular set of discussions.   In the financial discussions, on the other hand, we can, without any sacrifice of  principle,  make concessions.  It would appear from Appendix 2 (to which I refer  later) that onthe  question  of defence  also  we  might be able  to  go  some way  to  meet mr. de Valera, but as the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee suggests,the question how far we can go in this matter depends to a large extent  on  what sort of  a political settlement we can reach.   It seems clear, therefore, that themost helpful method of  securing a  satisfactory and  balanced agreement on  allthese questions lies now  in a simultaneous discussion of the main issues in oneset of negotiations.     7.   There is still, however, one matter of some importance  which could betreated  separately and  on  which  early action  would help to  improve the&quot; atmosphere &quot; for more ambitious negotiations.  I think that on its merits theappointment of  a United Kingdom  High Commissioner in the Irish Free  state is desirable.   Such officers are  already functioning  in  Canada, Australia andSouth Africa,  and  proving  a  valuable  part of the machinery  for  Imperialconsultation  and co-operation.   Several  foreign countries now have diplomatic representatives in Dublin.  The  presence of a United Kingdom High Commis-sioner  (assuming  that the right man for the post  can be found) would  be advantageous to counteract foreign influence as well as to keep us  better informedthan we are  to-day of all developments in the Irish  Free State,  and, it may be hoped, to promote better relations generally.   Such an appointment would be acceptable, I believe, to Mr. de Valera, and I would therefore propose to approachhim on the  subject, informally in the first instance.                          Fundamental  Principles.     8.   I  pass  to  a consideration  of the prospects of  a general settlement.Constitutional, defence, financial and trade questions are all involved.  Of these,the most difficult are the constitutional;  if we can make good progress on them,it would appear from Appendix 2 that agreement on  the defence problem shouldbe possible, whilst the outstanding financial  and trade questions should present no insuperable obstacles.     9.  With regard to the constitutional issue, I assume that there  are twofundamental principles on which we must insist. The first concerns the positionof the Crown.  Any satisfactory settlement must be  on  the  basis that the  IrishFree State continues a member  of  the British Commonwealth,  which  involvesrecognition of the constitutional position of  the King in the internal as well asthe external affairs of the Irish Free State.  The second principle relates to theposition of Northern Ireland.   I assume that we still take the line that we couldnot contemplate any action towards the establishment of a United Ireland without
the consent of Northern as well as Southern Ireland.  These are the main points on which Mr. de Valera&apos;s views have presented difficulties in the past, and anyprospects of settlement must depend largely on his present attitude towards them.    10.   What justification is there, then,  for supposing that his views might now prove more yielding than they have in  the past ?  It  is impossible to speak with any confidence about this.  With regard to  the former question, for example,Mr. de Valera has on more than one occasion since he assumed office declared hisEepublican  objective, and so far as I am aware has never yet, even in private conversation, gone beyond the point of saying that he would recognise the Kingas head of the British Commonwealth of Nations (of which a Republican IrishFree State would somehow be a member) in its Imperial and Foreign relations.He maintained this position in a talk which  I had with him when he was passing through London on his recent journey to Switzerland, and has always studiouslyavoided any admission that  he might consider a new agreement with the UnitedKingdom in which the King was recognised as the  constitutional head of theIrish  Free State as such.  But, on the other hand, he is  at least as anxious  to attain his other ideal, that of a United Ireland, and appears lately to have shownmore  realisation that a Republic is incompatible with this.   At least he has notbeen so insistent of late in forcing the  Republican issue.    11.  Some of those who  stand  near him  have  hinted  (for   example,Mr. Walshe, the  Secretary of the Department of External Affairs,  in a recentconversation at Geneva with Mr. Eden, see Appendix 3), that in certain circum-stances he might now be ready to compromise on the Republican issue.   All whom have met who have had close contact with him during his three years of officeassert that he has &quot; moved to the right.&quot; Certainly he shows evidence of a newdisposition to be  friendly with the United Kingdom.  He has frequently voicedthis desire  in recent  speeches;  nor has he stopped at  pious expressions  ofsentiment.   At the time of the meetings with Dominion Prime Ministers duringthe Jubilee  last  year he gave,  through Mr.  Dulanty,  an unsolicited formalassurance that the Free State would never be  allowed to be used as a base for external attack on England;  at the cost of much criticism in Ireland, he hasco-operated   closely  with our Government  at Geneva  throughout  the Italo-Abyssinian  dispute, showing that he has abandoned the traditional Irish policy that  &quot;Great  britain&apos;s difficulty  is  Ireland&apos;s  opportunity&quot;;  some of  theprovisions of  the Coal-Cattle  arrangements  and  the  Atlantic  Air ServiceAgreement are such as he would not have subscribed to a  few years ago;&apos; and he himself proposed  in the Dail the resolution of condolence &apos;&apos; with Queen Mary, theMembers of the Royal Family and the  people of Great Britain &apos;&apos; on the death ofthe late King.     12.  As Mr.  de Valera has  somewhat  modified his position, so also (if my information is correct)  has an  important section  of  Irish Free  State publicopinion.   I  am told by many who know Southern Ireland  that opinion is movingsteadily towards  an appreciation  of the advantages of the Imperial  connection,.and that consequently Republicanism has not such a strong appeal as it used tohave.  These informants were astonished by the large attendances at memorialservices,  and by the numbers of black arm bands worn by members of  the public in the Irish Free State at the time of King  George&apos;s death.     13.  I  do not wish to exaggerate the significance of these events, nor to minimise the extreme difficulty of getting Mr. de Valera to recognise the positionof the Crown. Sentimentally, the Southern Irish are Republican.  The crux ofthe negotiations would centre round this question of the Crown.  But if we can make some  gesture to help Mr. de Valera  to meet us on it, I do not think theprospect is hopeless.  And one of the great advantages of an agreement now wouldbe that an agreement with Mr. de Valera has,  on account of his unique positionand influence in Irish politics, much more prospect of being permanent than oneconcluded with any other possible Southern  Irish leader.     14.   Undoubtedly it will be difficult  to  get him to confirm the  Crown&apos;&apos;position  in  Irish Free State internal affairs.   Even if he personally could bebrought round to the view that such recognition would in all the circumstances be wise,  we must realise the delicacy of his political position.  At present his personal hold on  his fellow-countrymen is strong.  But a partv has grown up&quot;on
his  &quot;left,&quot;  and despite the change which seems to be taking place in Irishopinion, these advanced Republicans might become formidable if he lightly madethem a present of the Republican cause.  His adherence to the Crown could onlybe  made in circumstances which  in the eyes of  his  followers justified thisfundamental change in his view.     15.   Could we  do anything to  help to create those circumstances ?  Theprincipal Irish attack (frequently used by Mr.  de Valera himself) on the presentposition of the Irish Free State is that her  membership of the British Common-wealth and her allegiance to the Crown have been forced upon her.  It representsher as not being in the last resort a free political  agent.   Mr. de Valera himselfnow knows that interference from Downing Street  in Irish internal affairs is non-existent, but the great majority of his followers cannot fully appreciate that, andhe himself still appears to be haunted and impressed by the notion that in thelast resort Ireland &apos;s political freedom would prove  illusory, that Great britain would use force to prevent her leaving the Empire.  My colleagues will remember that at the end of 1933 he asked for an assurance that this would not be the case.The Cabinet at that time decided against giving him any such assurance.     16.   In  my  opinion, if  we could at  the  appropriate moment make  somecarefully-worded statement to the effect that the Irish Free  State is mistress ofher own  destiny, it might well make all the  difference to the  prospects of  anagreement between  the Free State and this country,  both as full members of theBritish Commonwealth.  Evidently Mr. de Valera places great importance on thepoint;  I  daresay it would make it much easier (to put it no higher) for him torecognise the Crown  if  he  could  say that of his own  unfettered  choice  as president of the  Executive Council  of an absolutely free country he chose thathis country should remain a member of the British Commonwealth, assuming  allthe obligations and reaping all the advantages  of that position.     17.   I would remind my colleagues that some such statement as I suggesthas already  been made  by a spokesman  of the United  Kingdom  government regarding the older Dominions.  Mr. Bonar Law,  speaking as the Leader of theHouse of Commons in 1920,  used these words : -         &quot; There  is not a man in this House .... who would not admit that    the connection of  the Dominions with the Empire depends upon themselves.    If  the self-governing Dominions Australia,  Canada chose to-morrow to    say  &apos; we will no longer make a part of the British  Empire,&apos; we would not    try to force them.  Dominion Home Rule means the right to  decide their    own destinies.&quot;I do not suggest that reference  to that statement,  or any new similar statement in the present case, would be sufficient by itself.   It should be supplemented bya clear, though not threatening, reminder  that if the Irish  Free State  were tosever her association  with the  Empire, the relations of  at least  its residentcitizens to the United Kingdom and the Dominions would naturally become, inevery aspect of their lives, economic  as well as political, those of any foreigners;and the statement might detail  the principal consequences which would flow tothem  from that.    18.   Such a declaration must of course be considered from the point of  viewof its reactions in other parts of the Empire.   From the  point of  view of ourrelations with the Irish Free State alone, which constitute an important part ofthe present Imperial  problem, such  a declaration  would have great, and mighthave decisive, value.                                The Crown.    19.  With regard to the  position of the Crown,  it would be a fair summaryof Mr. de Valera&apos;s position up to date to say that he  would be prepared to accept.some  form of association with the British Commonwealth and  to recognise theCrown as Head of the association for external purposes.  The fact  that he still continues to  submit for the King&apos;s signature formal documents relating to the external affairs of the  Irish Free State is evidence of this.   The difficulty whicharises lies in his unwillingness to confirm the position of the Crown in relationto its internal affairs.
    20.  We canot agree to a situation in which the Crown is recognised by a dominion for some purposes and not for others.  The whole structure  of  theEmpire will be undermined unless the Crown remains a vital part of the Legis-lature of each  Dominion, and the Head of its Executive  Government.   In  thecase of the Irish  Free State  this principle is set out  in  two Articles  of  theConstitution Article 12, which provides  that the Legislature  &quot; shall consist ofthe King and two  Houses &quot; (though this presumably will be amended shortly bythe abolition  of the Senate), and Article 51, which provides  that &quot; the executive authority of the Irish Free State is hereby declared to be vested in the king and shall be exercisable in accordance with the law, practice and constitutionalusage  governing the  exercise of the  Executive  Authority in  the case  of  theDominion of Canada by  a Representative of the Crown &quot; (i.e., the Governor-General).    21.  So far Mr. de Valera has taken no action which actually destroys  thesubstance of these  two Articles.   The objection to the steps which he has taken(apart from  the fact  that  some of  them are undoubtedly breaches  of treaty obligations), is  not that they have broken the connection between the Crown andthe Irish Free State&apos;s internal affairs, but that they show a  progressive tendency to diminish it.  Thus  as regards the  abolition of the Parliamentary Oath,  sir thomas Inskip (then Attorney-General) advised that  allegiance does not depend.on the taking of the Oath, and  that failure to take the Oath  is not in  itself arepudiation of  allegiance.  Similarly, the  abolition of the appeal to the JudicialCommittee, though objectionable in the case of the Irish Free State for  special reasons, is not in any way incompatible with membership of the British Common-wealth.  Other measures have  been directed to  limiting  the  functions to be performed by the Governor-General.  A note  setting  out in detail the functionsat present required to be performed  by the representative of the Crown in  theIrish Free State is  attached as Appendix 4.  These functions include such matters as the giving of assent to Bills, the appointment of Ministers (other than  thePresident of  the Executive Council,  who is nominated by the Dail) and  Judges,and the issue of statutory orders.  As the statement in  Appendix 4 shows, thereis at  present no scope in practice for the exercise of any discretion; the rightto grant or withhold a dissolution of Parliament, which is the principal exampleelsewhere, is  governed by special rules in the Irish Free State Constitution.    22.  The essential point would be to retain at any  rate the main substance-.of the two Articles quoted above.  But Mr.  de Valera is irretrievably committed to abolishing the office of  Governor-General as constituted under the Treaty, andit would appear that there is no prospect of obtaining his  agreement to  thecontinuance of  the office in anything like the form in which it exists in the otherDominions.  Apart from  anything else, I understand that the term &quot;Governor- &apos;General&quot; is suspect to the suspicious Irish.  The question is, therefore, whetherit is possible to devise some other method by which  the functions of the officemay continue to be performed on behalf and in the name of the Crown.    23.  There are a  number of possible alternatives.   I  do not propose to do much more than mention them  here.  If my colleagues approve of the  general idea of entering into  discussions with the Irish  Free  State Government, these alternatives (and any others) could be further examined prior to our committing ourselves to any one of them.  In any case, I suggest that we should not ourselvesput forward  early in the discussions any specific suggestions on this point; wemust  avoid the appearance of thrusting any  particular solution of this  crucialproblem on Mr. de Valera. Assuming that he has agreed to  the principle, weshould rather in the first place ask him whether  he has any proposal to suggestfor carrying it into effect, and endeavour then to guide the negotiations round toour own preferred solution.    24.  No  doubt the simplest solution,  and the. one most likely to commend itself to Mr.  de Valera,  would be that the functions to be carried out on behalfof  and in the name of the Crown should be transferred in their entirety to thePresident of the Executive Council.   But the combination  in one person of the function of King&apos;s Representative and Prime Minister would be entirely contraryto our constitutional ideas; and,  since the arrangement could not be limited to the
 present holder of the office of President, it would constitute a fetter on the King&apos;s discretion  in  the  appointment  of  his  Representatives  in  the- Dominions which was expressly recognised by the Imperial Conference of 1930.      25. . A second possibility would be that the functions should be performed by a Commission of,  say, three persons directly appointed by Commission from the King.   It  would no doubt be preferable that the persons to be appointed should be persons of an independent position  (for example, Judges, or the Speaker of the Dail), but the inclusion of the  President  of the Executive Council would not be open to such strong objection as  would his appointment as sole representative.      26.  A third alternative which has been suggested to me might be that the King&apos;s  authority in Irish Free State internal affairs should be symbolized by the use of the  special King&apos;s  Seal  of  the Irish Free State,  which is in the custody of the President of the Executive Council and would be affixed on his authority. This Seal has already been brought into use in the Irish  Free State for use on documents  relating to external affairs which require the King&apos;s signature.  This. would  presumably  involve the  displacement  of  the present Governor-General&apos;s Seal of  the Irish Free State.*   I cannot bring myself to think that this solution can be contemplated as in the least degree satisfactory.      27.  A fourth  possibility might be to appoint a member of the Royal Family to perform the functions of the  Governor-General, to be styled Viceroy.  But the risks involved in such an appointment in a country where an extreme Republican movement would in any case still exist no doubt render this solution impracticable.     28.   A fifth possibility, which has much to commend  it, would be that  the post of  Governor-General should be abolished and that the King himself should perform the functions  of the Crown in the Irish Free State, either personally or by express delegation or commission ad hoc as circumstances and convenience may require.  One matter of complaint  by the Irish is the fact that in the distinction between the Mother-country and the daughter Dominions the Irish Free  State is popularly ranked with the latter,  whereas they  claim that Ireland is one of the  mother-countries of the Empire.  There is, of course, some justice  in this claim so far as peopling the other  Dominions is concerned, and it might please the Irish, and would not perhaps be inappropriate, if the constitutional procedure in the Irish Free State approximated to that in this country rather than  to that in the other Dominions.   In other words, some  of  the  functions of the Crown, such as  the appointment of Judges and Ministers, might  be performed by  the King himself  by signature of the necessary commissions,  though  on practical grounds it  would be important  not to impose an undue burden on His Majesty by greatly  increasing  the  number  of  documents requiring personal  signature. Is it too ambitious also to suggest that the  King  might one day  ride through Dublin to open Sessions of the Dail  and read the Speech from the Throne ?  Those functions which he could not perform in person would be expressly delegated either to an individual or by Commission to a body of three or more persons.  The giving of assent to Bills,  for  instance, would be performed by such an ad hoc Commission as in this country.                     The Form  of any General Settlement.     29.  Assuming that it were  possible to reach some satisfactory  under- standing on the above points, the next question which would arise  would be the form which any such agreement would take.  One of Mr. de Valera&apos;s fundamental objections, to which he has become deeply committed in public, is to the whole idea  of  a Treaty with this country as  affording in any way the basis  of the position  of the Irish Free State.  From the purely theoretical point of view, it is difficult to defend an arrangement as between  two countries which are &apos;&apos; equal in    * The Governor-General&apos;s Seal of  the  Irish Free State (which is a single-sided Seal bearing an Irish harp) corresponds to the seal used by the  Governors-General of other Dominions to authenticate documents issued under the Governor-General&apos;s signature connected with the internal affairs of the  Dominion concerned.  The position in the Irish Free State in this respect is  the same as in the Union of South Africa, where there is a Governor-General&apos;s Seal  in existence, as well as a Royal Great Seal, which is used  for authenticating the King&apos;s signature on documents relating to external affairs.  In the case of the Irish Free  State, the Royal Great Seal bears onits obverse side a representation of the King enthroned,  as on the Great Seal  of the UnitedKingdom,  and on  the reverse an Irish harp./
status &apos;&apos; whereby the constitutional status of one is a matter of treaty obligationto the other.  No doubt, in the circumstances existing in 1921, there were strong reasons for a compromise whereby from one aspect it was possible to argue thatthe powers of the Irish  Free State  were derived from  a Statute of the UnitedKingdom Parliament as in the case of other Dominions, while from the other sideit was possible to argue  that  they rested on a document in the form of a treatyconcluded between representatives of the United Kingdom and of the Irish FreeState.  The legal position has now been  declared by the Judicial Committee, inthe judgment referred to in paragraph 14 of  Appendix 1, to be that, as a resultof the passage of the Statute of Westminster, the Irish Free  State Legislaturehas the power  to legislate in disregard  of the Treaty;  on the other hand, theJudicial Committee  added  that  they were  expressing  no  opinion upon  anycontractual obligation under which,  regard being had to the terms of the Treaty,the Irish Free State lay, and we claim that the moral obligation on the Free Statenot to violate the terms of the Treaty still remains, and that to exercise their legal powers  in the manner they have exercised them has undoubtedly  constituted a breach of the Treaty.    30.  The  Irish Free State Constitution  originally provided, in Article  50,that constitutional amendments should not become law until  after  submission toa  referendum  and approval by a  majority  of  the voters  on the  register ortwo-thirds of the votes recorded.  This provision was expressed not to come intooperation for  eight years, until 1930;  but by an amendment  made in  1929 itscoming into operation was postponed for a further period of  eight years, until1938.  If this  provision  (possibly with  some strengthening  as to  the  majorityrequired) were to be altered so as to  become operative immediately in an amendedConstitution containing provisions  acceptable from  our point  of view, might it not be advisable for us to accept the position as satisfactory \  If so,  we could/dispense with  any formal  agreement  concerning  constitutional  matters,  andsimply make a declaration to the effect that the relevant provisions  of the Treaty7of 1921 could now be regarded as superseded.     31.  Objection would no doubt  be raised by those in Parliament and outsidewho urge that  no new agreement should be  reached until the Irish Free  StateGovernment have formally acknowledged the validity of the Treaty of 1921 and agreed  that some of their actions  constitute breaches  of  that  Treaty.  But,however ideally desirable this may be, it must be admitted that from the practical point of  view  any attempt to secure  such  an acknowledgment  would provefruitless, revive unhappy controversy and destroy any chance of a new settlement.It would not only throw Mr. de Valera back  into the arms of the extremists,  butalso alienate from us many of the  supporters of the Commonwealth connectionin the Irish Free State themselves, who urge  that the Treaty is dead and cannotbe resurrected.  A great majority  of people in  both countries are, I  believe,anxious to see a realistic handling of the present situation; and any insistence onan acknowledgment by the Irish Free State  Government that  it has broken itstreaty obligations would be quoted as singularly different to our attitude towards germany&apos;s  breaches  of  the Versailles  Treaty  and the Locarno Pact.   We  can scarcely, without  ridicule and damage  to ourselves, be less  realistic  and  lessgenerous in our treatment of a  Dominion Government than in our treatment of aForeign Government.     32.  Of the provisions of the Treaty other than those referred to above, theArticles relating to defence (which are discussed  in paragraphs 35-8  below)might  form the  subject  of a separate agreement  on the  lines  indicated  inAppendix 2.    The only other Article  calling for  special- consideration is Article 16, which in  effect prohibits  in both Northern Ireland and  the Irish Free State religious discrimination. - So far as the  Free State is concerned, the require- ment of this Article might be sufficiently met by the retention in the Constitution, subject to  the safeguard  mentioned in paragraph 30  above, of the existing Article 8 dealing with the matter.*    * NOTE. Of the remaining Articles of  the Treaty, Article 9 deals with the  free use of ports. If necessary this could be included in a trade agreement.  Article 10, dealing with compensation to transferred public servants, has, in fact,  been already replaced by the special agreement made in 1929. The other Articles either have lapsed or are spent.  As regards the Annex to the Treaty, see Appendix 6.
                                 Nationality.     33.   There is another constitutional issue which has arisen in the course of the dispute.  It will be seen from paragraphs 15 to 17 of Appendix 1 that some controversy was aroused over the recent passage of nationality legislation in the Irish Free State.  It seems clear, in the light of the controversy, that it will not be possible to- obtain from Mr. de Valera an explicit acceptance of what we hold to be the true position, that citizens of the Irish Free State as such are subjects of and owe allegiance to  The King.  The most that might be obtained would be an acceptance of the principles laid clown by the Imperial Conference of 1930 (see Appendix 5). But these are not wholly satisfactory, and lend  themselves to more than one interpretation.  In the circumstances, I suggest that the wise course would be to make no attempt to obtain a statement of this sort at present, in the hope that time, and possibly the desire on the Irish Free State&apos;s part to facilitate reunion  with Northern Ireland, may produce a solution.  Mr. de Valera shows no  disposition  to challenge further our  interpretation  of the position,  and  no serious practical difficulty seems likely to arise.     34.   In this connection it will be remembered that the position resulting from the Irish Free  State  nationality legislation was fully examined by Sir Thomas Inskip, as Attorney-General.   In his memorandum, which  was circulated to the Irish Situation Committee as I.S.C. (32)  94, he advised that &quot; in my opinion the whole  conception of Mr. de Valera&apos;s plan to abolish a British status in the caseof Irish  Free State citizens is fallacious,&quot; and that &quot; as long as the Irish Free State is  within  the British Commonwealth  of Nations the persons born within the Irish Free  State are subject  to qualifications  in certain  cases British subjects, and no Dominion legislation purporting to be passed under the powers conferred by the Statute  of  Westminster can alter  that  fact.  If  this  is an accurate statement it seems necessarily to follow that the Irish Nationality Bill,while it  may effectually provide for  Irish Free State citizenship,  cannot  affect the status of a person  as a British subject.  Mr. de  Valera, in my opinion, is attempting to do what I regard as juridically  impossible.&quot;  He  concludes  thememorandum as follows :  &quot; The proper  course, in my  opinion, is to maintainfirmly  the position taken by the Secretary of State in his speech at Derby on the 1st December, 1934 &quot; (quoted in paragraph 17 of Appendix 1).                                  Defence.    35.  The difficulty of  reaching  agreement  with  the Irish Free State hasalways been rendered greater because of the  importance of certain Irish ports inparticular and of Irish  coast defence  in general in the defensive system  of Great Britain.   Special provision with regard to these was included in the 1921 Treaty, but it was recognised in the Treaty  itself that these provisions  were open to  review.   The  present  arrangements are  a matter  of complaint by the Irish, and would be an obstacle to any  new agreement.  On the other hand, itis essential from our point of view that the defences of these ports should  be adequately maintained in  peace time and that our own forces should have access to them in time of war.    36.  Mr. de Valera on his own initiative last summer authorized the  HighCommissioner to make a  special statement in the following terms :          &apos;: On more  than  one occasion Mr.  de Valera has  said that the  Irish    Government would not allow their country to be  made a base  of attack on    Great Britain.   Any  attempt to  use our country  for an  attack on England    would be resisted to the uttermost.   We hope that Great Britain will realise    that the people in Ireland have a  genuine friendship for the people  of    England, no less fundamental, despite current political differences.   All we    ask in return is more understanding and confidence.         &quot; If we are to take the measures which are clearly necessary to prevent    our country becoming a point of attack on  England, we must  be informed    unreservedly of  your  plans.  Consultation between the defence experts of ;    your country and ours appear to be  not only desirable, but, from the point    of view of our common interest, indispensable.&quot;
     37.  In conversations with private individuals which have been reported to me Mr. de Valera has said that his Government would be ready to spend whatever money was necessary to carry out the defence of the ports concerned.   This aspect of the matter was also referred  to by Mr.  Walshe in his conversation with Mr. Eden reported in Appendix 3, in the course of which Mr. Walshe, speaking with the authority of Mr. de Valera,  expressed the view that &apos;&apos; the Irish Free State was perfectly prepared to set aside  the necessary money to carry  out  the defence of these  ports themselves, and they were prepared to do this in consulta- tion with, and on the advice of, our experts.   This would certainly involve  the Irish Free State in a considerable  expenditure,  as it would involve the construe - tion  of destroyers, but  they were  prepared to carry this  out since they fully realised our interest in the matter, and the need for the close co-ordination of the defences of our two countries.   In this connection Mr. Walshe  emphasised that  .... despite the fact that the Irish  Free State had frequently been given information of a highly confidential character about defence matters, there had never been a leakage of any kind,  nor would there be.&quot;     38.  In the light of these statements the position has recently  been examined by the  Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee  of  the  Committee of Imperial Defence. A copy of their  report,  which has not yet  been considered  by the Committee of Imperial Defence, is attached as Appendix 2 to this memorandum.  I need not examine it here  in detail.  But if its conclusions commend themselves to  the Committee of Imperial Defence, the proposals contained in them would go a long- way to help in securing  a general  settlement  with the Irish Free State.  From M. de Valera&apos;s point of view, they would undoubtedly be  attractive,  in that they would end a situation which can be quoted against him as a practical limitation on the Irish Free State&apos;s sovereignty and freedom.   From our point of view, there is much to be said for actively associating the  Irish Free State Government in the general scheme of Imperial. Defence; whilst generally good relations with a friendly and co-operating Ireland really afford us  greater securitj^ than does the present situation, which is always liable to lead to  friction.                         &apos;   The Financial  Dispute.    39. The financial dispute in  form arises on the question whether  certain agreements involving the payment of  sums from  the Irish Free State  to this country are valid and binding,  and it would therefore seem reasonable that this legal question should, first of all, be referred to arbitration with a  view to settle- ment.   This is the basis on which  the first attempt to settle this aspect of the dispute was  made, but the proposal broke  down on Mr.  de Valera&apos;s refusal  to accept an arbitral tribunal limited, to members  drawn from within the British Commonwealth, of Nations.  We cannot depart  from our position on this issue, and there is no ground for hoping that Mr. de Valera would now be prepared to accept  a Commonwealth tribunal.   But,  apart   from   this,  there  are  other difficulties to which the suggestion of arbitration might give rise.   It is far from clear that Mr. de Valera would be prepared to accept an arbitration limited  to the particular payments now in dispute; he might wish to introduce a number of irrelevant matters,  such as the alleged over-taxation of Ireland during the past century, an issue which  he raised at the discussions which  took place with him in October 1932.  Moreover, even an arbitral decision on the legal question would not settle the claim of the Irish Free State that the burden of the payments  is more than  the Irish Free State can reasonably be expected to bear.  For these reasons,  I think  that  direct negotiation rather  than arbitration  is the proper method of trying  to deal, with the financial issues.    40.  The history of inter-governmental debts  since the war has  shown the disadvantages attaching to obligations of this kind, and the desirability of  faying to secure some scheme which will not  involve continued annual payments in future, with the risk of disputes  concerning  revision of the  terms, or even of repudiation, as a result, for example, of a change of Government.  I suggest that there wouldbe great advantages in getting this matter settled once and for all with the Irish Free State, by means of a single payment on the part of the Free State  Govern-ment,  and  I  should  like the possibility  of  this  carefully  examined by the departments concerned.   In  return  for  such a  payment  we should waive anyclaims  under the  Financial Agreements of  1923 and  1926 in respect of  which
 the Free State are in  default, and also to the annuity of  250,000  (for sixty years from 1926)  under the agreement of  1925, which the Irish Free State have continued to pay.     41.  As regards the basis for assessment of the sum which the Irish Free State can be expected to pay,  the total sums now due from the Irish Free State (apart from the  250,000 referred to  above) amount to about  4,900,000 a year. Of  this,  just  under  3  million is in respect  of  land  annuities  of which  the approximate capital value  was given in  1932 in the following terms:  &quot;The total amount of advances outstanding in  the Irish Free State of  which these annuities are in repayment, was about  89,500,000.  Against this  Sinking Fund payments have accumulated to approximately   13,500,000.&quot;  It should perhaps be  mentioned as regards these land annuities that in 1934 the Irish Free State Government decided to  reduce by one half  the amounts  to be  paid by  the individual payers of land purchase annuities.     42.  The other main items are an annuity of  600,000 a year for twenty years from 1926 due to the Local Loans Fund, and about  1,250,000 in respect of Royal Irish  Constabulary and other  pensions, the continuance of which depends on the survival of  the pensioners.     43.  The actual figure  that we should be ready to accept as a settlement I leave for further consideration.  If we decide to attempt negotiations, the depart- ments concerned should examine this whole question in all its aspects at once.                            Trade A  rrangements.     44.  If  a   financial  settlement  were  reached,  it  would  be  a  necessary consequence that the duties which we imposed under the Special Duties Act, 1932, in order to collect the sums due from  the Irish  Free State would be terminated. At  the same time, the Irish  Free State should also withdraw the retaliatory duties which they  imposed as  a reply to our special duties.   These duties,  called &quot;emergency duties,&quot; were imposed on United Kingdom goods  only; they were reduced by 50  per cent, in  the course of the recent renewal of the Coal-Cattle arrangement.     45.  It would no doubt be necessary  to make it clear that the removal ofthe special duties  on Irish Free State  goods would not affect the quota arrange- mentsin cases  where the quantity  of goods imported from the  Irish Free State is already subject to quota  (for example in the  cases of cattle,  condensed milk and bacon) and it  might be  necessary  to provide that some restriction should be placed on other goods to avoid any risk of the market being  flooded.     46.  But the  special and  emergency duties respectively have  not been theonly, nor  indeed the principal, causes of the recent reduction in trade between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State.   This has been due mainly to two other causes, first  the rapid extension  of secondary industries in the Free state as a result of  a comprehensive system of protective tariffs; and,  secondly, thegeneral fall in  purchasing power in the Irish  Free State.  The second of the difficulties would be modified to some extent as  a result of a general trade settle-ment between the  Irish Free  State and this  country, which ought to  improvematerially the prosperity of the Irish Free  State.  As regards the first difficulty,it seems at least doubtful whether we should be able to secure anything like a reversal of the Free State policy.  But we might hope to  achieve a diminution inthe pace,  if  not a cessation,  of the  setting up of new (and  in many  casesuneconomic) industries.   It became clear in the discussions which took place priorto the recent renewal of  the Coal-Cattle arrangement that, so far as  departmentalofficials at any rate are concerned, the Irish Free State authorities would be willingto negotiate a general trade agreement quite as favourable to this country as thosenegotiated with the other Dominions at Ottawa.   I therefore propose that, if weundertake negotiations for a general settlement, we should indicate that as partof, though not necessarily simultaneously with, the general negotiations we shouldalso be prepared to negotiate a special trade agreement on the lines of the ottawa agreements.
     47.   It will be remembered that in addition to the special duties under the Special Duties Act, Irish Free State goods are subject to duties imposed under the Import Duties Act 1932 (goods from other Dominions being exempt as a result of the Ottawa Agreements of 1932).   The most  important of the duties, apart from the general ad valorem duty  of  10 per cent.,  are  duties on potatoes and poultry (including turkeys).   It would seem appropriate that these duties should remain in force pending the conclusion of such a  trade agreement with the Irish Free State as I have referred to.                                 Procedure.     48.   The suggestions  contained in this  memorandum are not  intended  to represent hard and fast proposals for the settlement of the dispute with the Irish Free State.  Circumstances may render some alterations in them desirable, and, in any  case,  Mr. de Valera will no doubt have other proposals to make in the course of discussions.   It will be  important to impress him with  the fact that these are free  discussions, and that we are ready to give full consideration on their merits to his own suggestions.  In the light of these we should presumably be prepared to modify our own proposals, provided that the principles of what we consider a proper settlement are fully secured.     49.   I think that  anything in the nature of formal negotiations would be a mistake unless and until we  feel assured that substantial agreement between thetwo  sides  exists.  A formal negotiation which broke down would only render theposition even worse than it is, and  postpone the day of ultimate reconciliation.Moreover, such negotiations  could not  be started without an  outbreak of press reports and controversy which might seriously prejudice the chances  of success.If a step  towards negotiations is to be taken, it  should be in the first place byinformal  discussion, either with the  Irish Free  State High Commissioner inLondon,  or  between officials  acting  on the  instructions  of, and reporting  to,Ministers.  This was  the  method by which the two Coal-Cattle arrangements were successfully reached.  Whilst the discussions which I now propose are of amuch more important  nature, I  nevertheless suggest that there should  not beformal negotiations between Ministers until a later stage.  It might well be thatthis  first informal exploration of the ground revealed  that  the conditions of ageneral settlement did  not yet exist, in which case  we should have to  consider thewhole situation again.   We might then decide that, in all the circumstances, a partial settlement was  better than no progress at all.                                Conclusions.    50.   I therefore recommend that .    (1) The  question  of  the  appointment  of  a  United  Kingdom  flight          Commissioner in the Irish Free State should be taken up  at once.    (2) Informal discussions should be opened with the Irish Free State High          Commissioner, or  between officials  of the two countries, with a view          to exploring the possibility of a general settlement of  outstanding          questions.    (3) If the prospects  seem sufficiently good, the main outstanding questions          should be dealt  with in  one comprehensive set of negotiations.    (4) The bases of any political  agreement  should be  proper recognition by          the Irish Free State Government of the position of  the Crown in the          Irish Free  State  Constitution, and acquiescence by the  Irish Free          State Government in  the present  position  whereby the  consent  of          Northern Ireland is essential to the establishment of a United Ireland.   &apos;(5) We should be prepared at an appropriate moment to make  a statement          on the lines  suggested in paragraphs 15-17 of this memorandum.    (6) We should be prepared to agree to an alternative method of representation          of the Crown  in the Irish Free State to the present one, the precise          method to be decided in the course of negotiations.   (7) The new agreement need not be embodied  in a treaty. &apos;   (8) There should be no  attempt at present to settle the controversy regarding          nationality.
(9)  Whatever proposals  the  Committee of  Imperial Defence recommend       arising out  of  the Chiefs of Staff  examination  of  the problem  of       defended ports  should be adopted as the basis for a settlement of the       defence problem.(10) An appropriate lump sum payment from the Irish Free State should be       accepted  in settlement of  the financial dispute.(11) Our special duties on Irish Free State  imports should then be abolished       in return for the  abolition of Irish Free State discriminatory duties       against our imports.(12) Negotiations  for  a  trade treaty  between  the  two  countries should  be       initiated  at the earliest possible date afterwards.

11111 A1192 S.MEMORANDUM.       1.  It may be convenient to  set out briefly the main issues which have arisen inthe course of the dispute between  the United Kingdom and the Irish Free  State since mr.  de  Valera came  into  power in  March  1932 under the  two principal heads(A) Political and (B) Economic and Financial.                                  (A) POLITICAL.                     (i) The Parliamentary Oath  of Allegiance.    2. The first step in the dispute was taken by Mr. de Valera when in March, 1932,(in a statement subsequently published in Cmd. 4056), he announced his intention of abolishing the Oath of Allegiance required under the Treaty of 1921 and the Constitution.to be taken by members of the Irish  Free State  Legislature.   After an exchange of correspondence (also published in  Cmd.  4056) Mr. de Valera introduced a Bill for thispurpose;  the Bill provided not only for the abolition of the Oath  but also for the removal from  the  Irish Free State Constitution of various  provisions whereby the  Treaty wasgiven the force of law and overriding authority in  relation to the Constitution.    3. The United Kingdom Government were advised that this Bill was a clear breach of the Treaty, but did not amount  to a repudiation of allegiance or an act of secession.Their attitude  was announced in  a  statement  made  in Parliament by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs on the  11th May, 1932, in the following terms:             &quot; The provisions  contained in this Bill are in direct  conflict with  the obliga-      tions undertaken by the Irish  Free State under  the Treaty  of 1921.   It appears      to His Majesty&apos;s Government that if the Bill becomes law it would be unreasonable      to  expect that they should enter into  negotiations for further agreements with a      Government which had thus repudiated an Agreement already entered into.&quot;    4. In the course of discussions which took place with Mr. de Valera first in  Dublinand then in London in June,  1932, it was found impossible to reach  any settlement of theissue: Mr.  de Valera&apos;s position was described by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs in a speech in the House of  Commons on the 17th June,  1932, as follows:             &quot; His conception, his ideal and his ultimate  aim was a united Ireland called      understood and  accepted as a Republic; but there may  arise  and probably  will      arise certain circumstances when the  whole  of the British Commonwealth could      act together for external purposes.  Then, His  Majesty  the King  would  be      recognized under those circumstances  as the head.           &quot; That is a fair summary of what Mr. de Valera honestly and conscientiously      believes is the only basis that would bring what he called lasting peace to Ireland.      He quite frankly and fairly stated that he did not think he had  in the last election      a mandate to give effect to that, but it did not prevent him from making it quite      clear that he assumed that  he ultimately would  get that mandate.   He said:      &apos; I am also anxious to provide some modus vivendi whereby we shall get over      the present difficulty.&apos;             We said:  &apos; Very well, let us have it.&apos;           &apos;&apos; He said:  &apos; You &apos;- that is the British Government &apos; must agree to accept      the abolition of  the Oath as being our right and our business and  as nothing      whatever to  do with you.&apos; &quot;    5. The Irish Free  State  Bill was suspended by the action  of  the Irish  Free StateSenate;  but in February, 1933, Mr.  de Valera was returned to power at a general electionwith an increased majority.   He was  therefore in a position to secure  the passage of theBill notwithstanding the Senate&apos;s resistance, and the Bill was accordingly passed into law on the 1st May, 1933.    6. The attitude of the United Kingdom Government was set out  in a further state-ment made in the House of  Commons  by the Secretary of State for Dominion  affairs on the 4th May,  1933,  in the following terms:             &quot; As regards the  position which arises on  the passage of the  legislation,      His Majesty&apos;s Government in the  United Kingdom consider that the passing of the      Bill will not affect the duty of allegiance to the King or amount to an act of      secession.  They  are advised that the allegiance of the members of the Irish Free      State Parliament does  not depend upon the swearing of the Oath which  by the      Treaty and the Constitution they are required to take, and therefore that a failure      to take the Oath is not  in itself a repudiation of allegiance.   This does not alter the      fact that in the view  of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom  the      removal of the Oath is a breach  of the Treaty.&quot;Constitutional Relations-(C.21413/486).  125.
               (ii)  The Governor-Generalship  of the Irish Free State.    7. One of the objects which Mr. de Valera wished to achieve was to minimize as faras possible the importance of the position and the duties of the Governor-General.  Thisled to a  personal dispute with  the existing Governor-General (Mr. James McNeill) andthe publication in July, 1932, of some acrimonious correspondence between Mr. McNeilland Mr.  de Valera.  Subsequently in October, 1932,  on Mr. de Valera&apos;s advice tendered to &quot;die King,  Mr. McNeill was permitted to resign his office.    8. It appears that Mr. de Valera was then desirous that the constitutional duties ofthe office should be performed  either  (a) by the Chief Justice, without the necessity for taking the prescribed oaths  (which the Chief Justice was unwilling to take) or (6) &quot;by aCommission  of Three of whom the President of the Executive Council should be one.These proposals  proving unacceptable, Mr.  de Valera advised the appointment ofMr. Donal Buckley.  Since  Mr. Buckley&apos;s  appointment the ceremonial functions of theGovernor-General  have been entirely discontinued;  the official salary is still paid, but80 per cent of it is returned to the Irish-Free State Exchequer; only the duties specificallylaid down in the Constitution are  still performed, though  the scope of these  has beenreduced by the legislation referred to below.    9. In May, 1935, in the course of a debate  in the Dail on the vote for the Governor-Generals office, Mr. de Valei&quot;a suggested that this would be the last occasion on which such  a Vote  would be required.   While thus implying his intention of abolishing theoffice, he gave no clear indication of the precise steps which he had in contemplation.                      (iii) Further constitutional amendments.    10. In September, 1933, Mr. de Valera introduced three Bills for the amendment ofthe Irish Free State Constitution.   The  Bills provided  respectively for:             (a) The  substitution, in Article 37  of the  Constitution which deals with       messages recommending the appropriation of money, of &quot; a message  from the       Executive  Council signed  by  the  President of  the Executive  Council &quot; for       &quot;  a message from the Representative of the  Crown acting on the  advice of the       Executive Council.&quot;           (b) The removal,  from Article 41 of the Constitution, of the provisions       expressly empowering the Governor-General to withhold assent from a Bill, or to       reserve a Bill for the  signification  of the King&apos;s pleasure.           (c) The deletion of the proviso to Article 66 of the Constitution which reserves       the right of any person to apply to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council       for special leave to appeal  from a  decision of the  Supreme Court of  the Irish       Free State, and the insertion of a provision making it illegal for any person so to       apply.    11. The  attitude of the  United Kingdom Government was explained in a statement made by the  Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in the House of Commons on the14th November, 1933, in the following terms:             &quot;  We are advised that the legislation conflicts in important respects with the       Treaty of 1921, and  its passage therefore involves  a further repudiation  of the       obligations entered into  by the Irish  Free State under  that Treaty.  We have    .   already made  perfectly  clear the view  which we take of action  of this  kind.       Quite apart from any question of legality, we  look upon it as a repudiation of an       honourable  settlement.   No modifications of  the Treaty can properly  be  made       except by agreement  between the  two countries.  But that is not the only aspect       of the  matter.           &quot;  The real significance  of the Bills is that they  clearly indicate an intention       gradually to  eliminate the Crown from the Constitution of the  Irish Free State.       Mr. de Valera has told us (as I said in the House of  Commons on the 17th June,       1932) that his ultimate aim  is the recognition  of a United  Ireland as a Republic       with some form of association  with the  British Commonwealth in  some circum-       stances and for some  reasons and the  recognition of the King as the head of the       association.   Any such proposals would  be totally unacceptable to His Majesty&apos;s       Government  in the United  Kingdom.           &quot; Our view can be clearly stated.  The Declaration of the Imperial Conference       of  1926 as to  the  relationship of Great  Britain  and the  Dominions under the       Crown must be accepted as  the basis of the  constitutional position of the Irish       Free State within the Empire.   That Declaration is clearly inconsistent with a       state of things under which the Irish Free State would be a member of the British       Commonwealth of Nations  for some purposes and  not for all,  and would cease       to be united with Great Britain and the  Dominions by a  common  allegiance to       the Crown.
             Our conception of membership of the British Commonwealth is something       entirely different.  The Irish Free State as a member of that Commonwealth is,       as Mr.  de Valera  himself must now have learned,  completely free to order her       own affairs.  Membership of the Commonwealth confers great advantages, which       by her own action the Irish Free State is tending to lose; the privileges of common       citizenship, economic advantages in trading with the rest of the Empire, and the       opportunity of powerful influence in international  affairs, in  concert with the other       members  of the Commonwealth, in the cause of world peace.           &quot; Those privileges carry  with them responsibilities, respect for the Crown,       loyal observance of engagements, the spirit of friendship  and co-operation with       the other members  of the British Commonwealth.  It is  our desire  to  see the       Irish Free State  taking her full part as  a member of the Commonwealth, not       grudgingly, but of her own free  will, accepting the responsibilities and enjoying       the privileges.  If she renounce the one, she cannot hope to enjoy the other.&quot;     12. Mr. de Valera took the occasion in a public statement,  followed up by a despatchdated the 29th November*, to challenge the United Kingdom Government to declare theattitude which they would  adopt if the Irish Free State decided to sever its connexionwith the British Commonwealth.  The despatch (which was  read in  the House ofCommons by the Secretary of State  for Dominion Affairs on the 5th December, 1933)contained the following passage :  -             the experience of the last 12 years has made it abundantly evident that       lasting  friendship  cannot be attained on the  basis of the present relationship.       The Government  of the  Irish Free  State  infer  from your statement  of the       14th instant that the British Government also now realize the evils of a  forced       association and  have decided  not to treat as a cause of war or other aggressive       action a decision of  the Irish people to sever their  connexion  with the Common-       wealth. This  attitude of the British Government appears  to the Government of       the Irish  Free State to be of such fundamental  importance  that it  should be       formulated in a direct and inequivocal  statement.  The Government of the Irish       Free State would sincerely welcome such a statement.  They believe that it would       be the first step towards that free and friendly cooperation in matters of agreed       common concern between Great Britain and Ireland which  ought to exist between       them.&quot;     13. The reply! of the  United Kingdom  Government,  dated the 5th December (alsoread by Mr.  Thomas on the same occasion)  contained the following passage :             &quot; Since His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom  are thus unable       to accept  the assumption  in paragraph  5  of your despatch, namely, that lasting       friendship cannot be attained on the basis of the present relationship, they do not       see any grounds for answering a question which is founded on that assumption.       They cannot believe that the Irish Free State  Government contemplate the final       repudiation of their Treaty obligations in the manner suggested, and consequently       they do not feel called upon to say what attitude they would adopt in circumstances       which  they regard as purely hypothetical.           &quot; In  conclusion I would state that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United       Kingdom  feel  that the free intercourse on equal terms with the other members of       the British  Commonwealth which the Irish Free State have  enjoyed under the       Treaty Settlement, culminating in the Statute of Westminster, is the surest proof       of their freedom to  work  out their own destiny within  the  Commonwealth.  We       believe that the natural associations  between the two countries are such that a       close and friendly relationship between them is essential to their  full prosperity,       and  I would  once  again  emphasize what I   have previously  stated on  many       occasions, namely, that His Majesty&apos;s Government in  the United Kingdom are,       and  always have been, most sincerely  anxious to  work in friendly co-operation       with the Irish  Free State as a member of the British Commonwealth.&quot;    14. The  question  of the validity of  the  Irish Free  State legislation ((c)  above)abolishing the appeal to the Judicial Committee recently came before the Judicial Com-mittee  as a preliminary issue in  connexion with an application made in  a specific case(the Erne Fisheries case)  for special leave to  appeal.   The  Judicial Committee judgmentdeclared that as  a result of the passage of the Statute of Westminster the Irish Free StateParliament has the legal  power to enact legislation in conflict with the Treaty since theeffect of the  Statute was to remove  the fetter  which lay  upon  the Irish Free State-Legislature  by  reason  of  the Colonial Laws  Validity  Act.  The  Irish  Free Statelegislation, therefore, prohibiting appeal to the Judicial Committee by special leave wasvalidly passed.  The judgment added that  &quot; It would  be out of place  to criticize the* No. 11111 A/13.t No. 11111 A/13.
legislation enacted by the Irish Free State Legislature, but the Board desire to state thatthey are expressing no opinion upon any contractual  obligation under which,  regard being  had to the terms  of  the  Treaty,  the  Irish Free  State lay.&quot;   It  will be  seenthat this judgment does not in any way invalidate the view which has consistently beentaken by the Government here and has indeed been supported by a previous judgment of the  Judicial Committee in a copyright  case in 1930, namely, that the right of appealto the  Judicial Committee was one of the obligations resulting from the Treaty of 1921.The judgment merely says that, whatever the obligations undertaken in the Treaty, theFree State Parliament has the legal power to disregard those obligations and has exercisedthat power.             (iv) The Irish Free State Nationality and Citizenship  Bill.     15. During 1934 Mr. de Valera introduced legislation with the object of providing&quot; a  comprehensive  code of Irish  nationality  law.&quot;   The introduction of  some such legislation  was clearly necessary to complete  the provisions of Article  III of the IrishFree State Constitution which  defined Irish Free State Citizenship, and indeed was fore-shadowed by that article.  An outline of the  proposals was communicated  in advance to the  United Kingdom  Government.  The views of the United  Kingdom Governmentwere set out in a despatch dated the  9th  July,  1934*, in  the following  terms:             &quot; It does not seem to His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom that       the proposed legislation, which, it is observed, would repeal the British  Nationality       and Status of Aliens Acts in relation to the Irish Free State, could be regarded as       making provision for the maintenance of the common status as  contemplated in       the conclusions of the Imperial Conference of 1930 relating to nationality.           &quot; From the conclusions placed on record in the reports of the Conference on       the Operation of Dominion Legislation  of 1929 and the Imperial Conference of       1930,  it is clear that the two essential principles relating  to the  Common status       are:               &quot; (1) That common allegiance to the  Crown is,  as  stated in paragraph 75         of the Report  of the  Conference on the Operation  of  Dominion Legislation,         &apos; the basis of the common status possessed by  all subjects of His Majesty.&apos;             &quot; (2) That the qualifications for the possession of the common status are         matters for &apos; consultation and agreement  among the several members of the         Commonwealth &apos; (Conclusions (1) and (2)  of the  Imperial Conference of 1930).           &quot; Apart from the question of principle, it  would appear that,  under  the       proposed Irish Free  State  Legislation, certain classes  of  persons would  in fact       become, or be entitled to become, Irish Free State  citizens by virtue of qualifica-       tions which differ from those required  for the common status as established by       existing legislation and agreed between the Members of the Commonwealth.&quot;     16. On  the  second  reading of  the Bill  in  the  Dail  on  the 28th  November,Mr. de Valera made a statement in the following terms:             &quot; We are not able to take Acts off the British Statute Book.  We are not able       to prevent the British from calling  our citizens  British subjects. But I take it, if       there is any substance at all in  the principles  that have been agreed upon at some       of the Commonwealth  Conferences,  that when  this Bill  becomes  law it would       be an impertinence if they were to claim as  citizens  of their country people who       are  obviously  citizens of  another  country;  otherwise  all the principles  agreed       upon at the Commonwealth Conferences would go by the board.  I hope, therefore,       we have made ourselves quite clear upon this question of British subjects.  Under       Irish law, no  Irish citizen will  be a British  subject  when this Act is  passed.       If somebody else chooses to regard our citizens as his, we will take no  cognizance       whatever of  it as  far as our law and legal system is concerned.  And as I say,       if they were to continue that, after this Act was passed, it would be acting contrary       to the principles initiated at previous Imperial Conferences.  I might say this Bill       is designed to give effect, in the only way effect could be given, to those principles;       and so far as it is possible to reconcile our independent rights with that association,       or the independent rights  of other  States in the British Commonwealth, with the       idea of association then, this Bill does that.           &quot; Lest I should be misunderstood, at this stage,  I want to  say  that not a       single line of this Bill need be altered if a Republic  were declared  in  Ireland       to-morrow.  It is, therefore, quite consistent with  the existing position.  The terms       of this Bill need not be altered, in a single particular, if to-morrow a  Republic was       declared here for the whole of  Ireland.&quot;* No. 4187 E/5 S.
    17. The view of the United Kingdom Government was expressed by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs in a public speech on the 1st December as follows:            &quot; What is the status of a British subject?  With a few exceptions, any person      born within His Majesty&apos;s dominions is a British subject.  It is a status  which      is based on allegiance to  the Crown, and is a much wider conception than the      citizenship of any particular part of the  British Commonwealth of Nations.          &quot; No one has questioned the right of the Irish Free State to define Free State      citizens.  No  one  challenges that right  now.  Indeed,  the  right  is expressly      provided for in the Irish Free State Constitution.          &quot; But to define Irish Free  State citizenship is something quite different from      taking away the status of British subject from anyone who possesses it. When I      use the term &apos; British subject &apos; I  do not  use those words as applying only to      persons who have a special connexion with the United Kingdom or,  indeed, with      any particular part of the Empire.  I use them as applying to all persons who owe      allegiance to the Throne with whatever part of the British Commonwealth they      may be specially connected.          &quot; When Mr. de Valera says that it would be an impertinence if the  British      were to claim as citizens  of their country  persons who are obviously citizens of      another country, I think he must have misunderstood what our position is.          &quot; Mr. de  Valera has surely forgotten that the Imperial Conference of 1930,      in which the Irish Free State took part, affirmed that the &apos; members of the British      Commonwealth are united by a common allegiance to the Crown &apos; and that &apos; this      allegiance is the  basis  of the common  status  possessed  by  all   subjects  of      His Majesty &apos;.&quot;    18. In March, 1935, as part of his  general nationality legislation, Mr.  de  Valeraintroduced also an Aliens Bill.  The main part of this Bill was simply a re-enactment ofthe  existing United Kingdom legislation which remained in force.   One clause of the Bill,however, provided that every person not a citizen of the Irish Free State  was defined asan alien for the purposes of the Act in other words, within the Irish Free  State Britishsubjects not being citizens of the Irish Free State would, for the purposes of the Act,be described as &apos;&apos; aliens &apos;&apos;.  Another clause gave power to exempt from the applicationof the Act or of any Aliens Order made thereunder the citizens of any country in respectof which the Executive Council were satisfied that it is proper that such exemption shouldbe granted.  Mr. de Valera announced his intention of issuing an Order under that section in respect of citizens  of the United Kingdom and of other parts of the British Common-wealth, and an Order was so issued shortly after the passage of the Bill into law.   In thecircumstances  it was felt that as  no practical difficulty should arise from the operationof the legislation, it was unnecessary to enter any formal protest against the description of British subjects as &quot; aliens &quot; for the purposes of the Act.                          (B)  ECONOMIC AND  FINANCIAL.                         (i)  The financial issues in dispute.    19. When Mr. de Valera came into  power in March, 1932, he announced that theIrish Free State Government proposed to retain the Land Annuities accruing under theIrish Land Acts.  He subsequently enlarged  this claim to include also&apos; certain other payments which had previously been made by the Irish Free State  Government to theUnited  Kingdom.  The history of these  payments is, very briefly, that  when after theTreaty  of 1921,  the financial relations between the United Kingdom  and the Irish FreeState were examined in detail^an agreement was made (in February, 1923)  under whichthe  Irish Free State Government undertook to collect and pay over to the United Kingdomthe  sums due from tenant-purchasers by way of annuity in respect of holdings purchasedunder the Irish Land Acts; to pay a  contribution (about 12 per cent) in respect of theinterest due on additional  Irish  Land Stock which had been issued to enable a higher price to be paid to landlords than was recoverable from the tenants&apos; annuities; to pay a proportionate  share of the cost of pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary (who weredisbanded on  the establishment  of the Irish Free State) and of other civil and judicialofficers whose  service had been in Ireland but  who had already  retired;  and to continuethe payment  of certain  annuities which, had been  arranged to repay, with interest,capital  advanced for public works.  This agreement was  not published  as a  wholeuntil 1932; but public references were made to  it from time to  time in connexion with the specific payments  to  which  it related.    It  was, moreover, described  as provisionalpending the  &quot; ultimate  financial settlement &quot;.  In 1925  an agreement  was reached between the United  Kingdom and the Irish Free State  (and duly confirmed by both-Parliaments) the effect of which was that, as part of the settlement of the boundary
 question between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, it was arranged (a) that the United Kingdom  Government waived  any claim to contribution from the Irish Free State towards her share  of the  public debt of the United Kingdom, as  provided by Article 5  of the Treaty of 1921, (6) that the Irish Free State Government  should make an annual payment of  250,000 for 60 years in discharge of the moneys expended&apos;by the United Kingdom  in compensation for  damage  to  property in Ireland between 1919 and 1925.  This  was  followed by  a further  agreement in March, 1926, which  was described as the &quot; Heads  of the Ultimate Financial Settlement &quot;, and, so far as relevant, confirmed the arrangements made by the agreement of 1923.     20. Mr. de Valera&apos;s  claim in substance was that the agreements of 1923 and 1926 were invalid;  while admitting (and continuing to fulfil) the obligation to make an annual payment  of  250,000 arising out  of the agreement of 1925, he maintained,  in effect,  that the other payments arising out of the agreement of 1923 were not due, having regard to  the  provisions  of the  agreement  of 1925 releasing the  Irish Free State from  any contribution in respect of the public  debt of the United Kingdom.  He also urged  that the burdens imposed on the Irish Free  State as the  result of these agreements were too heavy to  be borne.     21. In  the course of the discussions  in June, 1932, to which  reference was made in  paragraph  4 above, the suggestion was put  forward that the issue in dispute should be referred to arbitration  by a Commonwealth  Tribunal to be  constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Imperial Conference of 1930.  Mr. de Valera  declined&quot;to accept such a tribunal or any form of arbitration limited to the British Commonwealth.     22. Subsequently (after the imposition of special duties in the  United Kingdom on Irish Free State produce, as to which see below), a  further meeting took place between the Prime Minister and Mr.  de Valera in London on the 15th July, 1932, but no  progress was made.  A further meeting was arranged in London in October, 1932, (the papers relating to the meeting were published  as Cmd. 4184).  At this meeting the Irish Free State representatives put forward a claim for a  new financial settlement between the two countries  in which account  should be  taken of  the alleged over-taxation for  the past hundred years. The United Kingdom  Government were unable to accept the position that such a claim had any valid legal or moral basis, and  no means of reaching  a settlement was discovered.                   The Irish  Free State [Special  Duties) Act, 1932.    23. In July, 1932, the  United Kingdom Government decided that it was necessary to  take special steps to meet the losses resulting from the Irish Free State defaults,  and consequently secured the passage  of the Irish Free State (Special Duties) Act, 1932, under which power was given, by Order, to impose special duties on Irish Free State  produce entering the United Kingdom, with a view to the making good of the loss to or additional charge  on any public fund of the United Kingdom caused by the Irish Free State default. An order was issued  on the  12th July  imposing duties  at  the  rate  of  20  per cent ad valorem on  cattle  and the other  principal  items of agricultural produce imported from the  Irish Free State into this country.   The rate was subsequently increased to 40  per  cent ad valorem,  and has since been maintained at that general  level, though specific duties have been substituted for ad valorem duties in the case of cattle and certain other products.&quot;    24. The  total sums collected in special duties amounted from  12th July,  1932, to 31st March, 1935,  to   10,696,900, as compared with a total Irish Free  State  default of  14,477,832.  This latter figure represents the full sum due from the Irish Free State; the actual payments from the Exchequer  resulting  from the  Irish Free State  default, for the same period, amounted to  10,642,202.   The difference between these two figures, amounting to   3,800,000,  consists of two parts (a)  2,000,000 in respect of land annuities representing mainly sinking fund  payments, which were not covered by the guarantee of the United Kingdom, (6)  1,800,000 in respect of local loans annuities at  600,000 a year, the non-receipt of  which  did not  result  in any  specific  charge on the United Kingdom Exchequer,  since the income of the Local Loans fund from other sources was adequate to meet necessary  outgoings.                           The Import Duties Act, 1932.    25. In view of the decision of the Government, referred to in paragraph 3 above, not to enter into further agreements with the Irish Free State Government, no agreement was made with the Irish Free State at the Ottawa  Conference  in July, 1932, and consequently the general scale of  duties  laid down in the Import Duties Act 1932 came into operation on  Irish Free State imports on the 15th November, 1932.   Subsequent
duties imposed by order under that Act have also applied to Irish Free State goods.  Thetotal  receipts under that Act from duties  on Irish Free State goods amounted, to the31st March, 1935, to  1,054,000.                              Irish Free State Duties.    26.  On the 25th July,  1932, the Irish Free State Government issued an  Order, byway of  retaliation for the duties imposed  in the United Kingdom under the  Irish  FreeState (Special Duties) Act, imposing special duties on certain categories of goods imported from the United Kingdom, the principal items being a duty of 5s. a ton on coal and coke,and a duty of 20 per cent ad valorem  on  cement, electrical goods and machinery, andiron and steel.    27.  Subsequently,  Mr. de Valera has introduced further tariff measures, includingcontrol  of imports by quota and licence, which have resulted in a diminution of UnitedKingdom imports into the Irish Free State.   The primary object of these latter measureshas, however, been the development of secondary industries in the Irish Free State,rather than the  diversion  of  trade from  the United Kingdom  to other  (especiallycontinental) countries.    28.  At the same time Mr.  de Valera has made continued  efforts to secure improvedmarkets in foreign countries for Irish Free State products, but with  marked  ill-success.In 1934 the Irish Free  State export trade to the United Kingdom was 94 per  cent of thetotal  Irish Free State export trade (as  compared with 97 per cent in 1932);  as regardsthe Irish Free  State import trade, the United Kingdom share was 67  per cent in  1934 ascompared with 73  per cent in 1932.   (The  figures  for  1935  will  probably show animprovement in the United Kingdom position as a result of the coal-cattle arrangement see below).                           The coal-cattle arrangement.    29.  In 1934,  as  part of the general agricultural policy in the United Kingdom,  itwas found necessary to restrict the import of  cattle  from the Irish Free State into theUnited Kingdom: the  quota figure adopted was 50 per cent as regards fat cattle and100 per cent as regards other cattle, as compared with the imports  for  1933.    30.  In December, 1934,  an informal understanding was reached whereby a somewhat higher quota of cattle would be permitted to enter from the Irish Free State during 1935,namely, as  regards fat cattle  at 66-f per  cent of 1933  quantities and as regards othercattle, a figure approximating to the average for the years 1930 to 1932.  At the sametime the Irish Free State Government undertook, by quota restrictions, to  secure thattheir  total coal requirements should be  met from United Kingdom sources, involving an approximate increase of supplies of United Kingdom coal of  lj  million tons a year.The arrangement was to be subject to review after six months, i.e., at the end of June,1935, if either party so desired; but so far no  suggestion for  any such review has  beenmade.  The duties on  both  sides remain in force.                             Suggestions for Settlement.    31.  From time to  time informal  suggestions have  been put forward  by various&quot; intermediaries &quot; with the  object of reaching a settlement of the dispute.  These  haveusually  taken  the form of  suggesting that an attempt should be made to  settle thefinancial and economic issues  first, leaving a settlement of the political  issues to follow in the better atmosphere which would,  it is suggested, result from the termination of the&quot; economic war &quot;.   The&apos; general policy of the United Kingdom Government has  been to make any approach to a settlement of the financial dispute conditional on a recognition by the Irish Free  State  of its position as a member of the British Commonwealth.  At thesame time  they  have  expressed  themselves  as ready to take any  opportunity for individual arrangements, as in the case of the coal-cattle arrangement referred to above;though it is thought, on an expert examination of the position, that there is little scope forany further arrangement of that kind within  the limits of the  existing policy  as laiddown in the Irish Free State (Special Duties)  Act.Dominions Office,    July, 1935.
Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1936.SECRET.

THE Dominions Office have asked that an examination should be carried out into the Service aspects of a possible modification of the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 with regard to defended ports.    We instructed  the Deputy Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee to  examine thequestion in the first  instance.  Their Report, which we have considered, and withwhich we  are in agreement, is attached.                    (Signed)       A. A. MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD.                                  E. L.

ENCLOSURE.                COAST  DEFENCES  IN  THE IRISH FREE STATE.            Report of Sub-Committee of Deputy Chiefs of Staff.    AT their 154th meeting (Minute 2) the Chiefs of Staff agreed:         &apos;&apos; That the question of the modification of the provisions of the Anglo-    Irish  Treaty with regard to the  defended ports  was  one  which should be    considered, in the first instance, by the Deputy Chiefs of Staff in consultation    with representatives of the Dominions Office.&quot;    2.  In accordance with our instructions we have considered this matter, andhave had the benefit of the assistance of Sir E. Harding and Sir H. Batterbee, as representatives of the Dominions Office, at our discussion of the question.Historical Position.    3.  It will perhaps be convenient to summarize briefly the historical positionof these defended ports. The Treaty of 1921, Article VII, laid  down that &quot; TheGovernment of the  Irish Free State shall afford to His Majesty&apos;s Imperial Forces      [12678]                                                   .   this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
-2(a) in time of peace such harbour and other facilities as are indicated in the annexhereto. .  . .&quot;  The annex referred to includes, in regard to Berehaven, Queens-town and Lough Swilly, the statement &quot; harbour defences to remain in&apos;charge ofBritish care and maintenance parties.&quot;     4.  Article VI of the  Treaty provided that until an arrangement had beenmade for the Irish Free State to undertake its own coastal defence &apos;&apos; the defence by sea of Great  Britain  and Ireland shall  be  undertaken by His Majesty&apos;sImperial Forces.&quot;   Provision was made for a conference to review the arrange-ment after five years.     5.  When the time came in 1926 for the holding of this Conference, only  oneformal Meeting was held  and  immediately  adjourned.  In the  next year  an informal meeting  was held between  experts to examine what progress could bemade. When the  Irish Free State representatives asked for particulars of  the precise requirements needed for the defence of the three ports, they were informedthat  the Cabinet was not prepared to discuss the handing over of the defences ofthe ports in Southern Ireland,  and that consequently  there was no object infurnishing the information asked for.  The full account of the reasons for  the refusal to discuss the handing over of these ports is  set  out in the Report of  theSub-Committee on Article  VI of the Irish Treaty (C.I.D. Paper No. 310-C as approved  with  amendments  by the Committee  of Imperial  Defence  at   its233rol Meeting on  the 16th  February, 1928).,     6.  Since that date there has been no general discussion with the Irish FreeState of  co-operation  in defence  matters, though specific questions have beentaken up from time to time (for example, Censorship).  There has, however, been little progress to record.     7. Recently,  in the  course of the  Meetings  with the  Dominion  PrimeMinisters held in  May this year, the Irish Free  State  High Commissioner was authorised by Mr.  de Valera to make  a special statement, the terms of which were as follows :          &quot; On more  than one occasion, Mr. de Valera  has said that the Irish     Government would not allow their country to be made the base of attack on     Great Britain.  Any attempt to use our country for an attack on England     would be resisted to the uttermost.  We hope Great Britain will realise that     the people in  Ireland have a genuine friendship for the people of England,     no less  fundamental despite current political differences.  All  we ask in     return is  more understanding and confidence.         &apos;&apos; If we are to take the measures which are clearly necessary to prevent     our country becoming  a point of attack on England, we must be informed     unreservedly of your plans.   Consultation between the defence  experts of     your country and ours appears to be not only desirable but, from the point     of view of our common interest,  indispensable.&quot;     8. The  substance of  this statement has since  been repeated in public byMr.  de Valera.  More recently, in October 1935, Mr. Walshe,  Secretary to  theIrish Free State Department of External Affairs, raised the subject in conver-sation with Mr. Eden at Geneva, and said that if the conditions of  the 1921Treaty could be revised, the Irish Free State was perfectly prepared to set aside the necessary  money to carry out the defence of  the ports in consultation with,or on the advice of, bur experts.                                                            political considerations.     9.  Mr. de Valera&apos;s statement is satisfactory so far as it goes, but it doesnot go far enough.  The arrangements in the Treaty so, far as  these ports were concerned were not;  we believe,  dictated primarily by any fear that  these portswould be used as a hostile  base for attack on Great  Britain.   The all-important consideration was that we wished to be  certain that our Fleet and Air  force would have all  the  facilities which they would need  in time of war for  use against the forces of  an enemy, more especially in  the protection of  the vitaltrade routes concentrated off the Irish coasts, in  the security of which  the IrishFree State is almost as  much concerned as the United Kingdom.  The  Treatyprovided this assurance  by reserving for the use of the &quot; Imperial Fprces &quot; the
ports in Ireland and ensuring their ^adequate defence by retaining the responsi-bility for it in our hands.  It appears essential, therefore,  to obtain as nearly as possible ah equivalent assurance should  these safeguards in  the  Treaty beabrogated by the modification of its terms.     10.  The  most satisfactory arrangement, if  it should prove feasible, wouldbe a better general understanding with the Irish  Free State,  which would enableour  Defence Services  to establish  the  same close  relations with the &quot;corres-ponding Irish  Free State Services as they already  enjoy with the other. Dominions.On purely military grounds it would be inexpedient to hand over the Irish coast defences unless improved relations with the Irish Free State  were assured.Whether the transfer of these coast defences should be considered  as part of ageneral settlement or as a step towards it is, we feel, a matter for the Governmentto decide.  We would, however, point out that the present time seems a  propitiousone for the transfer since the immediate importance of  the reserved ports hassomewhat decreased in view of the recent re-orientation of the  defence policyof this  country.  It is not suggested for a moment,  however, that the free andunimpeded use of these ports is in any way less vital to our Fleet than it has beenin the past, but rather that they have assumed  a somewhat lower  place in theorder of priority for the modernisation of defences than they had previously held,consequent upon the changed international situation.Naval forces.     11.  There is apparently some divergence of opinion between  the Govern-ments of the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom as to the interpretation of the expression &quot;coastal defence.&quot;  Mr. Walshe had apparently envisaged inhis conversation  with Mr.  Eden,  previously  referred  to, that  the Irish  FreeState would have to face the cost of providing a force  of destroyers for  coastaldefence.  The  Admiralty view, with  which we  are  in agreement,  is, however,that all that  had been intended by the  phrase  &quot;coastal defence&quot; was a fewauxiliary vessels such as mine-sweepers.   A small auxiliary force of this nature would be the most that could be expected or desired from the Irish Free state in the near future.  The provision of small naval  forces consisting  of  two orthree destroyers  only, involves many difficulties in manning and training of personnel.   On the other hand,  there can be no doubt that in the Dominionswhich possess their own small naval forces, feelings of admiration and  friendshiptowards the British Navy are engendered, and it may well be that the organisa-tion of  such a force in the Irish Free State would provide a very valuable pointof contact between that country and the United&apos;  Kingdom.     12.  We consider,  therefore, that if the Irish  Free  State  seem anxious tosupply a small force of destroyers of their own,  it would be  desirable, while notactively encouraging the idea, to avoid at the same time the raising of  difficultiesin their way.  The process of forming such a Navy would, in any case, have to be avery gradual one.Coast- Defences.     13.  With regard to the fixed defences of the three ports, proposals have beenmade by the War Office for the modernisation  of their equipment.   No work has been started yet, but in the estimates submitted in the Defence requirements committee&apos;s Report provision was made for this item, although it was  low inthe order of priority.   If the ports are transferred  to the Irish Free State, itwill  be essential to ensure that in due course the defences are brought up to  date.   &apos;  14.  It may well be that the Irish Free State would claim that  the, defenceswhen handed  over should be in proper order and* should not require  any large capital  expenditure, on them.   We  consider,  however, that in view  of the largeexpenditure envisaged by the Government of this country on our defence forces as a whole, the opportunity should be taken to press the Irish Free State to assumetheir share of  the burden by taking over the financial responsibility for bringing the defences up to date on a similar programme  to that which would  have been followed had they remained in our hands.                   .          ,       [12678]  -                                                 .^2--
     15.   The actual transfer of responsibility would have to be a gradual process. The Irish Free State Forces contain no coast defence units, and personnel would. have to  be  trained. This  could  only  be  done by  accepting their personnel for instruction  in the training establishments in this country.  Such an  exchange of personnel, however, would, as  in the case of the Navy, afford a valuable liaison between  the defence forces of the two countries. Air forces&apos;.  -1....     16.   Air facilities at the defended ports received  little consideration when the Treaty was signed, but they must be included in any arrangements made now. We  consider that the Irish Free State should be asked to place flying facilities at the ports at the disposal of the Royal Air  Force in war, and that if  they take over  larger defence responsibilities, they should be encouraged also to furnish air forces for coast defence work.  Concerted plans for  co-operation between the two  forces would have to be made. Necessity for periodical review.     17.   In any agreement reached with the Irish Free State, we consider that provision should be made for periodical review of the defences of these ports in order that our Forces may at all times be assured of the facilities  which they require.   The rapid technical developments which are now going on, make such a periodical review essential  if we are to be sure that  the  defences are  not allowed to become out of date. The  process of handing-over.     18.   Should the handing over of these defended ports to the Irish Free State he decided on, we are of the opinion that before the technical details  of handing over are discussed in any  way, the first step would be  to  ensure that  the Irish Free  State  Government is quite  clear as to our pre-occupations in this matter, viz.,  that  the ports should be available for use  by our Forces and that the defences should be adequately manned.  A clear understanding on their part  that it was for this reason only, and not because we feared any hostile use of the ports against this  country, might go far to improve the general political atmosphere  in which the arrangements for the transfer of responsibility would  take place.  Once the ground had been cleared in this way, the Service Departments could begin to develop their schemes for training the Free State personnel and making  the technical  arrangements necessary for the hand-over. Treatment of the Irish Free State tvith regard to secret matters.     19.   A  general improvement of relations with the Irish Free State.and  a decision to hand over the ports would necessitate a change of our present policy toward the  Irish Free  State with regard to secret matters.   At present their personnel, unlike these of other Dominions, are not allowed to attend any courses of instruction or defence establishments where they would  have  any  access to secret defence matters.  Should they be placed on a par with the other Dominions and  become  responsible for the defence  of  the Reserved ports,  it would be desirable  for their representatives  to attend  the Meetings of the Joint Overseaand  Home Defence  Committee when coast defence  matters affecting  these ports were under  discussion,  and, further,  their officers and men would  have  to be admitted  to attend schools of instruction  at which other secret matters were dealt with.   We  consider,  therefore,  that  consideration  must be given  to  the question of  a relaxation of our present attitude towards the Irish Free State in regard to secret  matters of defence.   This point was raised by Mr.  Walshe inhis conversations with Mr. Eden, and he stressed the fact that where any secret information had been imparted  to  the Irish Free State,  no leakage,  had ever occurred; we understand this to  be the case.  This would be an essential part ofthe general  improvement of relations between the  forces of the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State, referred to in paragraph 10.            .
CONCLUSIONS.20.  Our conclusions may be therefore summed up as follows:   (i) That the most satisfactory arrangement,  if it should  prove  feasible,      would be a better general understanding with  the  Irish Free State      which would enable  our Defence Forces to establish  the same close      relations  with the corresponding Irish Free  State  Services as they      already enjoy with those of the  other Dominions. .-- (ii) Provided improved relations are assured, despite  the  risks involved, it      would be desirable to offer to hand over the  complete responsibility      for the defences of the reserved ports to the Irish Free  State.(iii) That the Irish Free State should be asked       (a) To supply the necessary auxiliary naval  vessels for the  general             harbour defence  of the ports, and  that if they wished to do             more than this and supply some  destroyers as well, they should             not be discouraged from doing so.      (&amp;) To take  over the whole of the coast defences (guns and lights)             and to assume financial responsibility for the modernisation             of these defences in due course.      (c) To place flying facilities at the ports at the  disposal of the Royal             Air Force, to consider  the provision of air forces for coastal             defence and to concert plans with  the Air Ministry  for  the             co-operation of this force with the Royal Air Force in case of             emergency. (iv) That the defences of the ports, after handing  over,  should be periodically      reviewed in co-operation  with the Irish Free  State  to ensure  that      they  are  kept up to date.  (v) That our desire  for  complete assurance of the  availability  of  these      ports for use by our Forces and for the adequacy of their defences,      in  the interests  of the safety of  the  territory and communications      of the Irish Free State no less than of the United  Kingdom, should      be made clear to the Irish Free State Government before  any technical      discussions are instituted to cover the actual process of handing over. (vi) That,  as part of  a general  improvement of  relations, consideration      should be given  to the question of relaxation  of our present attitude      towards the Irish Free State in regard  to secret matters of  defence      generally.

11111 A/208 S.No.PROOF86(Confidential.)        NOTE OF MEETING BETWEEN MR. EDEN AND MR. WALSHE.       On the occasion  of a chance meeting here with Mr. Walshe, he remarked to methat I had seemed to have bad luck in my meetings with Mr. de Valera, since I hadbeen  unable to go out,  owing to  a heavy cold, the night when I was dining with him,and Mr. de Valera himself had had to go to Lausanne to see an oculist on the occasionhe had been invited to  dine with me.   I took this as an indication that Mr. Walshe or mr. de Valera  might want to speak to me, and I asked Mr.  Walshe whether he wouldlike to come along and  have a talk some day.  Mr. Walshe accepted at once, and the conversation  took place this morning.    The earlier portion of our talk  dealt with foreign affairs.  ... I remarked thata satisfactory feature of the  present situation seemed to me to be that our delegationswere  at  one in their view of the present dispute.  Mr. Walshe said that certainly thiswas so, and, he added, would always be so.  There was no reason  for any divergence of views between us in  foreign politics, since our interests were the same.   Mr. Walsheadded that Mr. de Valera welcomed  this  the more in  view  of the  difficult  situationbetween our  countries in other respects.    Mr.  Walshe  said that he would  not hide from  me that  Mr. de Valera  had been much disappointed at the reception which  certain recent overtures of his had  met with.At the last meeting of  Prime  Ministers, Mr. Dulanty had  made a  definite  statement which indicated the willingness of the  Free State to co-operate  with Great Britain  in defence  matters.   That statement had met  with  no response whatever, either  at  thetime  or  later.  The result of this was that Mr. de Valera  felt that he did  not  know where he was.  Mr. Walshe  begged  me to believe that Mr.  cle Valera was not anti-British and referred in evidence of his contention to Mr. de Valera&apos;s attitude on repeatedoccasions at Geneva.    Mr.  Walshe referred to the negotiations which had been going on for the establish-ment  of an  air port in  the Irish Free  State on the  proposed transatlantic route.  Hewas  glad to  know that these had made  a  good beginning,  and he hoped  that theywould be successfully concluded.  The Irish Free State  had done all  they  could  tofacilitate negotiations with  a genuine desire to show their  helpfulness in  the matter.    Mr.  Walshe wondered whether some progress could not  be made  in the  matter ofdefence.  He had told Mr.  de Valera that  he was coming to  see me  this morning, andthe latter had  authorized him to make  certain  purely tentative  suggestions to me.Mr. Walshe felt that the difficulty of  the negotiations hitherto had been that both sideshad stated their maximum, and neither had moved from that position.  In the matterof defence there  was the most difficult question of ports.   In this respect if we  couldrevise the conditions of the 1921 Treaty,  the Irish  Free State was perfectly preparedto set aside the necessary money to  carry out  the  defence  of these ports themselves,and they were prepared to do this in consultation with, and on the advice of, our experts.This  would  certainly involve the Irish Free State in a considerable  expenditure, as itwould involve  the construction of destroyers, but  they were  prepared to carry this outsince  they fully realized our interest in the matter, and the need for the close co-ordinationof the defences of our two countries.   In this connexion Mr. Walshe emphasized that,despite the difficult relations between our  two countries, and despite the fact that  theIrish  Free State had frequently been given information of a highly confidential characterabout defence matters, there had never been a leakage of any kind, nor would there be.    Mr. Walshe  went on  to  speak of the problem  of  united Ireland.  He said thatMr. de Valera  fully appreciated that  this could not come about all at once.  The mosttherefore that could probably be  hoped for at this stage would be some declaration by both  Governments in Ireland expressing a hope that at some future  date when both parties desired  it a united Ireland might come about.    Finally there was the problem of  the position of The King.  I would be aware thatHis Majesty at present signed, on the  advice of Mr. de Valera, all the documents calling for his  signature  in respect  of  external  affairs, even  including the appointment  ofConsuls.  There was no desire to make any change  in  this  practice.  The  only out-standing problem  therefore  related to the Governor-General.   Mr. Walshe believed thatin 1928 His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom had been  willing to consider some suggestions  to meet this difficulty.  The  continuation of  the  appointment of a governor-General was not desired, but it should not be  beyond the wit of  man to find some means of meeting this situation  in  a form which could be  acceptable to both countries.Constitutional Relations (C.21413/4S2).  125.
2     I told Mr. Walshe that I was not in a position to discuss with him any of the subjects which  he had raised,  which concerned the  relations  of the United Kingdom and theIrish Free State, since this was far wide of my province.  I  would, however, take carefulnote of what he had said, and report if,  Mr. Walshe rejoined that he did not  expect any early reply  from us,  as he fully understood that we should soon be in an electoralcampaign.  He  added, however, that  he  did hope  that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould  consider the possibility of taking the next initiative themselves, in the light of theinformation as to Mr. de Valera&apos;s position  which he had given me.Geneva,    15th October, 1935.(Initialled)  A.

11975/37 S.No.PROOF.FUNCTIONS OF  THE  GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE IRISH FREE STATE.     ; The principal functions of the  Governor-General of the Irish Free State  are as    l.  The giving of the Royal Assent to Bills passed by the Irish Free State Parliament.    This is laid down in Articles  41  and 42 of the Irish Free State Constitution which(as amended in 1933)  provide as  follows:            &apos;&apos; So soon as any Bill shall have been passed or deemed to have been passed      by both Houses, the Executive Council shall present the same to the Representative      of the  Crown for the signification by him,  in the  King&apos;s  name,  of  the King&apos;s      assent &quot;          &quot; As soon as may be after any law has received the King&apos;s assent, the clerk,      or such officer as Dail Eireann may appoint for the purpose, shall cause two fair      copies  of such law to be made, one being in the Irish language and the other in      the English language (one of which copies shall be signed by the Representative.      of the Crown to  be enrolled for record in  the office  of such officer  of the Supreme      Court  as Dail  Eireann may determine), and such copies shall  be conclusive      evidence as to the provisions of every such law, and in case of conflict between the      two copies so deposited, that signed by  the  Representative of the Crown  shall      prevail &quot;.    2.  Summoning  and dissolving Parliament.    Provision is made in Article 24 of the Constitution that &quot; the Oireachtas shall be summoned and dissolved by the Representative  of the Crown in the name of the King &apos;&apos;(It is provided in Article 53 that the Oireachtas shall not be dissolved on the advice of an executive Council which has ceased to retain the support  of a majority in the Dail).    3.  Appointments.          (a) Ministers          Article 51 of the Constitution provides that &quot; the Executive Council.....      shall consist of not more than seven nor less than five Ministers appointed by the      Representative of the Crown on the nomination of the President of the Executive      Council     (Under Article 53 the President of the Executive Council is appointed      on the nomination  of the Dail) Article 55 provides  for the appointment by the      Representative of the Crown of Ministers who are  not Members of the Executive      Council.          (b) Judges          Article 68 of the Constitution provides that &apos;&apos;  the Judges of the Supreme Court      and of the High Court and of all other Courts established in  pursuance of this      Constitution shall be appointed by the Representative of the Crown on the advice      of the  Executive Council &quot;.    4.  Prerogative  of  Pardon.    Article V of the Royal Instructions of the  6th December, 1922 provides as follows :               And We  do  further authorize and empower  Our said Governor-General,      as  he  shall see  occasion,  in  Our name and  on Our behalf, when any crime  or      offence against the  Laws  of  the  said  State  has been  committed  for which the      offender may be  tried therein, to grant a pardon to any accomplice in such crime or      offence who  shall give  such information as shall lead to  the  conviction of the      principal offender, or of any one of such offenders,  if more than  one;  and further,      to grant to any offender convicted of any such crime or offence in any Court,  or      before any Judge, Justice  or Magistrate, within the said State, a pardon, either      free or subject to lawful conditions, or any respite ol the execution of the sentence      of any such offender, for such period as to Our said  Governor-General  may  seem      fit, and to  remit any fines, penalties or  forfeitures which may become due and      payable to Us.   Provided always that Our said Governor-General shall not in any      case, except where the offence has  been  of a political nature, make it a condition of      any pardon or remission of sentence that the offender shall  be  banished from  or      shall  absent himself from the  said  State.  And  We do hereby  direct and      enjoin  that  Our said  Governor-General  shall  not pardon   or reprieve  any      such   offender  without  first   receiving Vin  capital   cases   the   advice  of      the Executive Council for the said Statr^nd in other cases the advice of one,      at least,  of his Ministers; and in any c?&apos;J$m which such pardon or reprieve might      directly affect the interests of Our Empire, or of any country or place beyond thefollows:  and constitutional Relations-(C.21413/485).   125.
      jurisdiction of the Government of the said State, Our said Governor-General shall      before deciding as to either pardon or reprieve, take those interests specially into      his own personal consideration in conjunction with such advice as aforesaid.&quot;    5. The making of Statutory Orders.    Section 10 of the Irish Free  State Adaptation of Enactments Act  1922 providesthat:-           &quot; Wherever it is provided in any British Statute* that any act or thing shall      or may be made or done by  Order in Council,  or by the King  (or  Queen) in      Council, or by Proclamation of the  King (or Queen) or of  the King (or Queen)      in Council, then every such act or thing may be made or done in Saorstat Eireann      by an Order of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State upon the advice of      the  Executive  Council of the Irish Free State.&quot;    Provision is also  made in individual Statutes for action to be taken by Order  of theGovernor-General in  Council.  Thus  section 175 of the  Irish Free State  Industrial and commercial Property (Protection) Act 1927, dealing with the grant of copyright to otherparts of His Majesty&apos;s dominions and to foreign countries provides that:        &quot; the Governor-General may  by  Order made on  the  advice  of  the  Executive      Council direct that this Part of this Act......shall apply &apos;&apos; to works published      in such countries, etc., and section 173, dealing with the situation if  a country does      not  grant copyright to the Irish Free State,  provides that &quot; it shall be lawful  for      the  Governor-General by Order made on the advice of the Executive  Council to      direct &quot; that the  provisions of the Act shall not apply to that country &quot;.    6. Use of the Great Seal of the, Irish Free State.    Article II  of the  Letters Patent of the  6th December, 1922, provides that &quot;  Thereshall  be a Great Seal of and  for the Said State which  We do hereby  authorize andempower Our said Governor-General to keep and use for sealing all things whatsoeverthat shall  pass the said Great Seal &quot; but there are no special provisions  as   to thecircumstances in which this Seal is to be used.October, 1935.* (i.e,, any Statute in force in the Irish Free State on the 6th December, 1922.)(
 11111 A/202.                          No.                               PROOF,  g                     NOTE ON NATIONALITY QUESTION.     The conclusions  of the Imperial Conference of 1930 on the subject of Nationality- were as  follows:             &quot;(1) That the Conference affirms paragraphs 73 to 78 inclusive, of the Report       of the Conference on  the Operation of Dominion Legislation.           (2)  That,  if any  changes are desired  in  the  existing requirements for the       common status, provision should be made for the maintenance of the  common       status,  and the changes should only be introduced (in accordance  with present       practice) after consultation and agreement among the several Members of the       Commonwealth.           (3)  That it is  for each Member of the Commonwealth to  define for  itself       its own  nationals, but that, so far as possible,  those nationals should be persons       possessing the common status, though it is recognized that local conditions or other       special  circumstances  may from time to time necessitate  divergences from this       general principle.           (4)  That the possession of the common status in virtue  of the law for the time       being in force in any  part of  the Commonwealth should carry with it the recog-       nition of that status by the law of every other part of the Commonwealth.&quot;     Paragraphs 73-78 of the  Report  of the Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation to  which reference is made in (1)  above read as follows:       &quot; 73. Nationality  is a term with varying connotations.  In one sense it is  used to indicate a  common consciousness based upon race,  language,  traditions,  or  other analogous ties  and interests  and is  not necessarily  limited to the geographic bounds of any particular State.  Nationality  in this sense has long existed in the older parent communities of the Commonwealth.   In another  and more technical sense it implies a definite connexion with a definite State and Government.  The  use of the term in thelatter sense has in  the case of the  British Commonwealth  been attended by  some ambiguity, due in part to its use for the purpose of denoting also the concept of allegiance to the Sovereign.   With the constitutional development of the communities now forming the  British Commonwealth  of  Nations the terms  &quot; national,&quot;  &quot; nationhood,&quot;  and &quot; nationality,&quot; in  connexion  with each Member, have come into common use.     74. The status of the Dominions in international relations, the fact that the King, on the advice  of his several  Governments assumes obligations and acquires rights by treaty on behalf of individual Members of the Commonwealth, and the position of the Members  of the Commonwealth in  the League  of  Nations,  and in  relation to the Permanent Court of International Justice, do not merely involve the recognition of  these communities as distinct juristic  entities, but also compel recognition  of  a  particularstatus of  membership  of  those  communities for legal and political  purposes.  These exigencies have already become  apparent; and two of the Dominions  have passed Acts defining their  &quot; nationals &quot; both for national and for international purposes.     75. The Members  of the  Commonwealth are united by a common allegiance to the Crown.  This  allegiance is  the basis  of the common status possessed  by all subjects ofHis Majesty.     76. A common status directly recognized throughout the British Commonwealth inrecent years  has been given a  statutory basis through the operation of the british nationality and Status of Aliens  Act, 1914.    77. Under the new position, if any change is made in the requirements establishedby  the existing legislation,  reciprocal action will be necessary to  attain this  samerecognition the importance of which is manifest in view of the  desirability  of facilitatingfreedom  of intercourse and the mutual granting of privileges among the different  partsof the Commonwealth.    78. It is of course plain that  no Member  of the  Commonwealth either could or would contemplate seeking to confer on any person a status to be operative throughout theCommonwealth save in pursuance of legislation based upon  common agreement, and  itis fully recognized that this common status is in no  way inconsistent with the recognitionwithin and without the  Commonwealth of the distinct  nationality  possessed by the nationals of the individual  states of the British Commonwealth.&quot;Constitutional Relations-(C.21413/484).   125.
11111 A/202.                          No.                               PROOF.               NOTE ON THE ANNEX TO THE TREATY OF 1921.     It should be added that the annex to the Treaty of 1921 which sets out, in relationto Article 7 (a), the &quot; Harbour and other facilities &quot; to be afforded to &quot; His Majesty&apos;sImperial Forces in time of peace &quot; includes not only specific defence facilities but alsoprovision for the making of Conventions between the two Governments with regard tocables and wireless, lighthouses, etc., and the regulation of civil communication by air.     These Conventions have never been made but the  position has always been takenhere, on the advice of the Law Officers, that the provisions of the annex  operate as aconventional arrangement pending the signing  of formal  Conventions.     Some negotiations have taken place with regard to the question of lighthouses, etc. ;but  these,  though complete  on the point of substance, have not been completed as aConvention on the ground that in present circumstances we  are precluded from makingformal agreements with the  Irish  Free State.     The regulation of civil communication  by air is at  present on a satisfactory basis,i.e., both countries  adopt,  as  a  de facto arrangement, the relevant provisions of  theInternational Air Convention of 1919.     Although  the  requirements referred to in the Annex  were inserted primarily  for defence purposes,  those  referred to as to be governed by Conventions are general  interms, and probably are valuable  for other  than purely defence purposes.  It would bedesirable, therefore, subject to the views of  the technical Departments concerned in thiscountry, not to lose sight of the provisions in question in the course of any negotiationswith the Free  State.Constitutional Relations (C.21413/483).  125.
