At their Meeting  on May 27th, 1936  (Cabinet 39  (36)Conclusion  2)  the Cabinet had under consideration thequestion of  the amount of the subsidy to be paid in future to the home  producers of fat cattle, and agreed that theissue should be remitted for consideration and re-port  to aCommittee composed of:-          The  Lord Chancellor (in the Chair),          The  Home Secretary,          The  Minister of Health,          The  Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for                           Foreign Affairs (Lord Stanhope).2.     The points of view of the Treasury and the agricultural departments  have been submitted to us by the Chancellor of theExchequer and  the Financial Secretary to the Treasury and bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the parliamentary under Secretary of State for Scotland respectively.    We havealso had before us recent relevant Memoranda and other documents,including some of those circulated to the Committee on Trade and agriculture.3.     Very briefly the position is that the Exchequer subsidy of 5/- per cwt. under the Cattle Emergency Provision Acts of1934 and 1935  is costing the Exchequer at the rate of  3,900,000per annum.    In the absence of fresh legislation the subsidyterminates on  31st October next.    So far as can be foreseenthe result of  the present negotiations with Argentina and theDominions will be that a levy of ifd.  will be imposed on foreign
 beef only and tills is  estimated to provide  about   3,000,000 per annum.        The Agricultural Departments ask that  the  gross amount of assistance should be increased from  3,900,000 to  5^00,000. If account is taken of the  levy ( 3,000,000)  on the foreign imports the  cost  to the Exchequer on this basis would be  2,200,000 per annum.   The  Chancellor  of the Exchequer has offered gross assistance, subject to certain  important conditions of  4,300,000,  of  which  3,000,000  would be derived from the levy on foreign imports leaving  1,300,000 per annum to be found by the  Exchequer.        The Agricultural Departments  also ask that the fixedsubsidy should be  subject to periodical review by the CattleCommittee or  some  similar body,  with  a view to protecting thehome producer by some increase of the fixed subsidy againsta  collapse of prices due,  for example, to the outbreak of ameat war between Argentina and the Dominions.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer is unable to entertain this suggestion.4.     Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarisedas follows:-       (l) We agree in recognising the great objections to           subsidies of all kinds, and we think that there           is good reason for the apprehensions felt by the           Treasury that the continuance of a subsidy to           the home producer of beef may be invoked as a           precedent for subsidies to other branches of           agriculture or manufacturing industries.    In           view,  however,  of the exceptional position of           the home industry at the present time  we  think           that in all the circumstances the continuance           of the subsidy can be justified in the case of           beef.    This should not,  however, be regarded           as in any way creating a precedent for similar           treatment in the case of airy other product,           agricultural or industrial.       (2) We agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer           that he cannot reasonably be asked to  undertake           the unlimited liability of guaranteeing a fixed           price  to the home beef producer,  or an indefinite           liability towards that producer to be  determined           by some outside body.    We think that  in  the           event  of a collapse of prices due to,  e.g.  a           meat war,  we should reserve  liberty of action
    vis a vis Argentina and the Dominions so as to    enable us to take whatever measures may then he    thought &quot;best to safeguard the home producer?    for example hy prohibition or restriction  of    iniports excess levies, etc. ,  and that it would    not he right in such an event to call&apos;upon the    Exchequer to hear the cost of indemnifying the borne    producer.(3) The Treasury and the Agricultural Departments    agree that if the price rises above say 44/6    the Exchequer subsidy should be reduced.    We    concur in this view.   It will be for the    Departments concerned to work out the proposal    in detail.(4) We agree that the subsidy should be so  adjusted    as to encourage the production of the best    quality beef.    We also concur in the view that    the extra cost involved in quality improvement    and also in the efficiency measures (market    reseax^ch,  centralised slaughterings publicity,    etc.)  should be met out of the fixed subsidy.(5) In view of the fact that both the Agricultural    Ministers  have impressed upon us the great    importance from the point of  view of the    maintenance of the industry of securing a    return to  the home producer  of 42/6d.  per cwt.    we are satisfied that a figure for the subsidy    approaching that suggested by them is in the    circumstances justifiable.    Accordingly we    reconunend  that the subsidy should be fixed at     5,000,000 per annum,  and that the Treasury    should be  protected against further liability    by the adoption of the various safeguards    mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeHAILSHAMChairman.Whitehall gardens.
