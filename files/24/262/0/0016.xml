THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  May 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy No;CP. 126 (36).CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN  CONVERSATIONS.          Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.     I HAVE been giving earnest and serious consideration to the discussion inthe Cabinet on the 30th April upon the proposals which I  made with regard tothe time limit in a prospective treaty with Egypt, and the suggestions which v/eremade by my  colleagues in the course  of those discussions.   The  issue is so important that I feel obliged again to  refer the matter to  the Cabinet, because(a) it is clear  that there have been misunderstandings about  the nature and effectof my proposals in the minds  of  some  of my colleagues  at any rate, misunder-standings which  may  well have influenced their conclusions, and  (b) I feel ought to set out what appear to me to be the effects of some  of the alternative suggestions  which  were offered, the more  so  since  I  was  unable,  during thediscussions,  to deal adequately with these points.   I  begin,  therefore, with afurther explanation of my original proposals, and I annex for convenience the text of articles 9 and 16, which I laid before the Cabinet on the  30th April, and then proceed to (b).(A) Further Explanation of the Proposals placed before the  Cabinet on April 30.I. The Proposed Text  for Article 16 Duration of the Treaty.    My proposal here is (i) that for a period of 20 years the  treaty is to go onunchanged :  the text does not  contemplate  that even proposals for  its revisionshould be put forward during this period,  (ii)  At the end  of the 20 years  it is contemplated  that  one party  or  the  other  may suggest  a  revision,   but until  the  revised  treaty  is  concluded  the  present  treaty  goes  on  unchanged.(iii) .The  revision  may  take  place  in  one  of  two  ways :  (a)   by  agree-ment  between the  United  Kingdom  and  Egypt  without  any  third partyintervening; 20 years  is a long time  ahead and it  is impossible  to prophesy,but there should be a reasonable expectation that the revision would be accom-plished  in this way; (b) in the event of Egypt and the United Kingdom  notagreeing as to how  the provisions are to  be revised, the Council of the League isto decide.  There is a decision  of the Permanent Court of International Justice(in the Mosul Boundary Case) explaining what the procedure is when a matter is referred for a decision  of the Council of the League in this way.  The Councilof the League  acts unanimously, but not counting the votes of the parties engagedin the dispute.  Therefore the only decision of the League which can affect a revision of the treaty is a unanimous decision.   If  the  Council were unable toreach unanimity the existing treaty would continue unchanged,  a situation whichwould not be  unfavourable to His Majesty&apos;s Government.   (iv) Further, it isprovided that  the new treaty must be concluded on the basis  that (a)  the positionof Flis Britannic Majesty in regard to the Canal is safeguarded (this  means  thatHis Britannic Majesty  has the right to  protect  the Canal further  explanationand justification of that  phrase will be found below in my  comments on  theproposed sentence in article 9). (5) the safety of Imperial communications through      8571   [13156]
Egypt is to be provided  for.  These  two principles  therefore  are  secured  in perpetuity and  bind Egypt  and the Council of the League in any  revision  ofthe treaty.     I think the text which  I put up gives effect to all the above points in my proposal; should it  not  be so, it is the text and not my  proposal as explained above which I would desire to be changed.II.- Further Explanation  of Proposal for A rticle 9 (underlined sentence in text).     The object of this sentence is to cover two points :       (i) to secure the recognition by Egypt of the right of His  Britannic Majesty           to defend the Canal, i.e., to possess the right  which the  Suez Canal           Convention, Article  9,  accords to Egypt and Turkey (this is what is           meant  by the  words &quot;the position of  His Britannic Majesty,&quot;  a           position which  Article  16 makes permanent);     (ii) to secure the recognition by Egypt of the right of His  Majesty&apos;s Govern-           ment for the purposes of protection of the Canal, to exercise martial           law in the Canal Zone over the inhabitants and all persons therein.Both these  points have  been set forth as essential requirements by  the  Chiefsof Staff, and neither of them has been secured  in any previous draft treaty with egypt.  In the  case of neither of them would it be possible for the Egyptians&apos; toaccept a text which set forth our requirements  in language so clear that its effect would at  once be apparent to everybody.  Indeed, even if the Egyptians would accept a  text which  set  out (i)  and  (ii) - above in plain  and  obvious terms.it is  at least open to  question  whether it  is in the interests of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to  do so.*   In  my draft, what  the  &quot;position  of  His  BritannicMajesty in relation to the  Suez  Canal &quot; (which is referred to) is,  is shown (i)  bythe remainder of the sentence which indicates that it is a position which justifiesthe King  of Egypt in recognising that His  Britannic Majesty  may take all steps necessary for the safety of the  Canal,  and (ii) by referring to Article 9 of the suez  Canal Convention, which  accords the right to  protect  the Canal to egypt and  Turkey, and the Treaty of Versailles,  which makes His Britannic majesty the successor of  Turkey.   When the text is  looked at in this way,  it can, I think,be shown that the King of Egypt must by it be recognising that  it is His BritannicMajesty who has the right to protect the  Canal.   In this way the weakness  ofour present legal position  in regard to the Canal would be  cured, the weaknessbeing that we have never had  a recognition of this right from the territorialsovereign.   The second point (the right to  exercise  jurisdiction by martial  law)is, I think, also  covered,  because the text refers to &quot; all steps necessary,&quot;  which,therefore, includes  jurisdictional  steps and  jurisdictional  measures taken  by military commanders are taken as a  rule under martial law.    (B) The Three Alternative Proposals suggested at the Cabinet Meeting.    The three proposals  that were made appear on page 20 of  the minutes of themeeting.  I will take them in the  order (i), (iii), (ii). Proposal (i) is that thetreaty should be concluded for twenty years and that nothing whatever should  besaid as to what should happen at the end of this period. It is, of course, quite a normal thing for a treaty to be concluded in  this form, but the effect would be thatat the conclusion of twenty years the treaty  comes completely to an end and thereis nothing to replace it, nor any particular right to have it replaced by any othertreaty provisions.   Under this  proposal, at the end of the  twenty&apos; years  HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be left without any treaty right to have&apos;troops  inEgypt at all,  and  without  any alliance.   There  would not even  be  a clearacceptance by Egypt in  perpetuity  of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s right to defend the Canal, or of the fact that we must have such rights in Egypt as are necessaryfor the defence  of imperial communications.   I have no reason to suppose  thatthere would  be any  difficulty in securing Egyptian  acceptance of this proposal,but I think that this is far  less favourable to His  Majesty&apos;s Government thanthe proposals put forward by  me,  which will be only accepted by  them with difficulty,  if at all.    Proposal No.  (iii)  makes the  treaty permanent  (i.e., the alliance betweenEgypt and the United Kingdom), but limits to twenty years the clauses relatingto the Suez Canal.  But this seems to be rather the reverse of what  the  Chiefs   *  N.B.-We do not wish to give a handle to any foreign Government for saying that this isa matter which should be considered by all the parties to the Suez Canal Convention.
 of Staff have considered appropriate, since they wish our rights in the Canal zone to be permanent, but see less objection to the other provisions being subject to a time limit.     Proposal (ii) is that the text  of Article 16 proposed by the Foreign. Office should be accepted with  the  last  sentence deleted.   There appears  to be  no criticism to be made of this proposal from the legal point of view.  The result of it is that the treaty goes on unchanged until both parties agree to modify it, but it is this proposal which Sir Miles Lampson has stated repeatedly has no chance of acceptance by Egypt.        (C)  Observations on certain other Points made  in the Discussion.     It was remarked in the course of the discussion that His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment were making an immense concession to Egypt in offering to withdraw from Cairo  and Helouan and that we could use this as a basis for insisting on her meeting us  as regards the time limit.  The Egyptians  might, however, well say that they had  made a considerable concession to meet us if they agreed  to the retention of troops at Alexandria, and to an increase of the number of troops in the  Canal zone with right  to reinforce in an apprehended emergency, whereas in the  1930 draft treaty there was no provision for the retention of British  troops outside the Canal zone at all, and inside that zone numbers and facilities were far more limited than those now offered us,  and no provision  for  reinforcement in emergency had been agreed to by the Egyptians.     It was suggested  in  connexion with the proposal  for Clause  9  that a reference should be made  to the interests of the Dominions in the Canal; the disadvantage of such a reference is that it would be more  difficult in the case of any  dispute before the Council to contend that the Dominions were not parties to the dispute, and therefore Dominion members of the Council were entitled to vote.  A  Dominion on the Council entitled to vote on such an occasion could be of decisive value to us. (D)  Consideration  of whether it is more Advantageous  to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-         ment,  if the Egyptian Delegation refuse to accept Clause  16 without         the last sentence, to allow the Negotiations to break  on this point, or         to  secure a Treaty with this last sentence.     I  feel it my duty to ask my colleagues to consider this question in view of Sir  Miles Lampson 5s repeated statements that  the Egyptians would not accept a text similar to Article 16 without the last sentence.     It was  my intention, and in the letters written by the  Foreign Office  to the Service Departments this is so stated, that a determined attempt should first be made  to  secure  Article 16  without the last sentence.  The  question here is whether, if this  fails, it is more advantageous to accept  this  sentence than to lose  the treaty.   Under  the Foreign Office proposals Egypt&apos;s agreement would be secured in perpetuity to the principle that it was His Britannic Majesty who had  the right to defend the Canal, and that there must always be treaty provisions between the United  Kingdom  and  Egypt  which would  make  any  provision necessaiy to ensure the safety  of His  Britannic Majestj^s  communications. These principles would be binding upon Egypt in any revision and on the Council if called upon to adjudicate in case  of dispute.  Since a decision of the Council changing  the existing treaty would have to be unanimous, I do not consider the risk  to be serious that a unanimous Council would impose upon  His  Majesty&apos;s Government provisions completely inadequate  for the protection of  Imperial communications.  This risk, whatever it may be, must, however, be balanced with the risks of the situation  in which a failure to conclude a treaty would  leave His  Majesty5s Government.  Would His Majesty5s Governments vital interests be safer in those circumstances?     Under the present  position His  Majesty5s  Government have in relation  to Egypt  a weak  political position and a legal position  which is not completely secure.  The political position is weak because the state of affairs established  in 1922 can only continue so long as an Egyptian Government can be found with the,will  and the strength to govern Egypt while  His Majesty5s Government retain their vague powers  under the reserved points.  Hitherto the constant prospect  of
 a treaty has alone rendered it possible to find such an Egyptian Government.   If treaty negotiations failed, it is by no means impossible that a wave of nationalist feeling in Egypt fanned by Italian propaganda would arise so great that no such Egyptian Government can be found.  His Majesty&apos;s Government would then be left with the alternative of placing a large  number of  troops in  the  country and governing by military force.  The strategic disadvantages of this as compared with a friendly Egypt  need no emphasis, and it is  obvious  that such a  state of affairs would be most unpopular with public opinion in this country.  The legal position of His Majesty&apos;s  Government in connexion with the powers which they claim to possess in connexion with the Canal is not a safe one, though my advisers consider that if it were  submitted to a court  the chances of His Majesty&apos;s Government  succeeding are slightly greater than  those  of their losing.   The greatest danger of our  insecure legal position  is  probably  the extent to Avhich it can be exploited in connexion with hostile agitation or by other Governments who wish to oppose His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy.   In addition, there are, of course, risks that by some means or other  the legal issue could  be brought before an  international court,  but this  possibility,  though,  it must not be neglected, is thought to be less likely to arise.  Egypt cannot bring the matter before any  court unless  she becomes a member of the League  of Nations, and though  another foreign Power, such as  Italy, might raise a dispute  with His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment over some act which involved His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s position in Egypt and the Canal, there would remain the  question of the extent to which HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s reservation  on accepting the Optional Clause (excluding disputes arising out of situations and facts prior to 1929) would make it possibleto establish that the court had no jurisdiction. It is hardly possible to say with certainty in the abstract whether this reservation would  be a complete protection (it would  certainly be some protection), because the dispute might arise, in  thefirst place, on facts and situations  which were  subsequent  to  1929, but  todetermine whether what was done was legal or not, it might be  necessary to  forman opinion on the reserved points and His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s position inrelation to the Canal.  Under the treaty, however, these legal dangers disappear.                                                                     A.  E.    Foreign Office, May 1,  1936.ANNEX.     9.  His Majesty the King of Egypt authorises His Britannic Majesty to*maintain  upon Egyptian territory, in localities in the vicinity of the Canal, such forces as  His Britannic Majesty considers necessary to ensure  the protection ofthis artery of communication.   The presence of these forces  shall not  constitutein any manner an occupation, and will in no way prejudice the sovereign rightsof Egypt.  In vieiv of  the position of His Britannic Majesty in relation to the suez Canal, His  Majesty  the  King  of Egypt  recognises  that  His  BritannicMajesty may, through  the Commanders of these forces, take all steps necessaryfor the maintenance of the security of, and of the freedom of navigation in, thesaid Canal.     The detailed  arrangements for carrying into effect the provisions of thisArticle are contained in the Annex hereto.     16.  At any time after the expiration of a period of twenty  years from thecoming into force  of the treaty, the high contracting parties  will, at the requestof either  of them, enter  into negotiations with a view to such  revision of its terms by agreement between  them  as m&amp;j be  appropriate in the circumstances asthey then  exist, it being understood that the position of His Britannic Majesty inrelation to the Suez Carnal and  the continued maintenance and protection in ailcircumstances of the essential communications of His Britannic Majesty shall beprovided for in any revision of the present treaty.  In case of the high contracting-parties being unable to  agree upon the terms of the revised treaty, the  difference-will be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations.
