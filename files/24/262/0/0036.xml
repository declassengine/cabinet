Copy No.  43CP. 146 (36).CABINET.DISCUSSION  WITH  DOMINION REPRESENTATIVES  CONCERNING                    NEGOTIATIONS  WITH  EGYPT.        Memorandum; by the Secretary  of State for Dominion Affairs.    LAST night  the  Foreign  Secretary  and  I  saw representatives of  theDominions chiefly interested in the Egyptian negotiations.  There were presentDr. Earle Page, Mr. Menzies and Mr. Bruce for Australia,  Sir James Parr for new Zealand, and Mr. te Water for the Union of  South  Africa.  The  foreign secretary explained fully to them  the  decisions  which had been reached that morning by the Cabinet, and the instructions which were being sent to Sir miles lampson.  A discussion followed.    Dr.  Earle  Page at first appeared  doubtful  of the wisdom  of the policy,showing again (as he had done at the Committee of Imperial Defence) dislike ofthe provision regarding the Council of the League of Nations.  But, as thediscussion  went on, he was considerably influenced by the views  of  his  twoAustralian colleagues and the other Dominion representatives present.  All were impressed by  the importance of the provision  for the recognition of our permanentright on the Suez Canal.  All recognised that there was an element of risk  in thesuggestion concerning the Council  of the League,  but  maintained that in  anyproposal there would be a certain  amount of risk.    Mr. Menzies expressed  the view that if we could get the present proposalsembodied in  a treaty,  our position would be considerably  stronger  than it isto-day.   He said that if we  were involved in any trouble with Egypt at presentwhich resulted in an appeal to the  League, our position now before  the council would actually be weaker than it would  be twenty years  hence with the provisionregarding our permanent right written  into  the treaty.  He thought the present proposals an  improvement on any  proposals which had resulted from  previoustreaty  discussions,  and that, despite the element of risk contained in it, thegeneral plan  was satisfactory.    Mr. Bruce attached great importance  to our getting  a treaty.   He  was concerned with two points : (1)  that our position in  Egypt should be so  securethat there was no  likelihood, in case of riots and attacks on foreigners, of any foreign Power intervening  with military force  to protect their  nationals,  and(2) that our position on the Canal should  be safeguarded.  In all the circumstances he thought that the present proposals were the best that we could hope for (indeed,he was doubtful whether they  would be conceded  by the Egyptians), and thatthey protected our position adequately.  There was, undoubtedly, an element ofrisk at  the end of  twenty years, but that amount of risk was worth taking inorder to secure a treaty.  It would, indeed, be very satisfactory if  we could  secure a treaty on these terms.     Mr. te Water  looked at the question entirely from the point of  view  of thesituation in Africa. He was chiefly impressed with the importance of retaining the friendship of the Egyptians.  That would be an important element of security in North Africa.  With the French colonies in the north containing large  numbersof native troops, and the Italians now controlling  large numbers of native forces       [13265]
it would be extremely dangerous to incur the enmity of the Egyptians.  Therefore,he too attached great importance to securing a treaty which would have the effect,according to Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s assurances, of gaining the greater friendshipof the Egyptians.  He therefore strongly favoured the present proposals.    Sir James Parr agreed with  these general  conclusions.    Dr. Earle Page seemed finally reassured when he realised  that  the decisionof the League  Council, according to our proposals,  would be a unanimous one,excluding the votes of the Egyptians and ourselves.  He assumed that a BritishDominion would always be a member of the Council.    So far as these representatives of the Dominions are concerned,  the foreign secretary and I are satisfied that in  all the circumstances they  are in agreementwith  our proposals,  and that their influence on their several Governments willbe  exercised to  gain  those  Governments&apos;  support.   Indeed, the AustralianMinisters expressed  themselves as so confident of their Governments  approvalthat they stated that they did not consider  it necessary to refer the matter totheir  colleagues at this stage.                                                   (Initialled)       M. M.May 21, 1936.
