ilS DQOTBSNT 13 THE PK.DP.aRTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;6 GOVERNMENT).ST                        C A B I N E T                  COPY NO. /%                        WATERLOO BRIDGE.              Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.               In their Money Bill of the present session the London      County Council have again included an item in their Schedule of      Estimated Requirements tor Capital Expenditure to cover the      demolition of Waterloo Bridge, and the erection of a new bridge.      In their accompanying memorandum they state that in the event      of the Money Bill as passed by Parliament containing such      provision, it is the intention of the Council to ask for a grant      from the Road Fund towards the cost of the work.   They have      asked me whether I desire to make any observations upon this and      other items in their memorandum and I &quot;have replied that I do not      desire to do so at this stage.               In the circumstances explained in CP,95(35) it was      decided last year not to oppose the conferment of borrowing      powers, but in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s decision I informed      the House&apos; of Commons on the Second Reading of the Bill that      (whatever decision the House might reach on the question -whether      or not the Council should be allowed to charge this expenditure      to capital instead of meeting it out of revenue, as they at one      time announced their intention of doing) the Government      regarded the question of a grant from the Road Fund as settled      by the previous declarations of Parliament against the      destruction of the Bridge.               I do not, of course, know on what grounds the Council      think themselves entitled to raise the matter again;  they may      possibly argue that a new House of Commons should be given a      further opportunity of considering whether or not it will      endorse the Council&apos;t action.
         I shall no doubt have to make some statement on theSecond Reading of the Bill and I presume that I  shall be acting in accordance with the wishes of the Cabinet in  adhering to  theposition which I adopted with their approval last year.L.H.-B.23rd April,  1936.
