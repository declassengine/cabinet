THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 135 (36).CABINET.POSSIBLE ITALIAN DESIGNS ON  ARABIA AS A RESULT OF               ITALY&apos;S SUCCESS  IN ABYSSINIA.          Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs.    AT the meeting of the Cabinet on the 6th May I undertook to make enquires as to whether there were any signs that Italy, following her success in Abyssinia,had designs on the Yemen and Saudi Arabia with  a view to securing a position on both sides of the  Red Sea.  A  memorandum on this question has how beenprepared in the Foreign Office, and I circulate it to my colleagues herewith.                                                                   A. E.    Foreign Office, May 9, 1936.    The final Italian success in Abyssinia is still so recent that there has not been time  enough to receive reliable reports  to  show whether it  has led to any modification or development of Italian policy in Arabia.   It is thus only possibleto examine Italian policy in Arabia as it was before the latest developments in abyssinia, and to form a provisional estimate of the  present and future positionin the light of the past.    2.  Hitherto Italy&apos;s attitude towards Saudi Arabia and the Yemen  appearsto have been in  accordance with the conclusions of the  Anglo-Italian Romeconversations of 1927, a copy of which is  attached for convenience of reference.The main provision of those conclusions was  a  mutual agreement to respect theindependence of the various Arab States on the Red Sea Coast of Arabia, and a recognition and acceptance of the fact that it was to  the mutual interest both ofthis country and of Italy that  no European Power should establish itself on the arabian shore of the Red Sea.    3.  There is no reason to  believe that the Italians would have  hesitated  toviolate this agreement, in the  same way as they  have violated many others,  ifthey had thought it to their interest to do so; but.all our evidence suggests  thatthe Italians realise that if they were to violate the Rome understanding the effect would be to release us from our  own obligations in that document,  and hithertotheir  main anxiety  seems to have been to preserve the  independence of SaudiArabia and the Yemen from British influence rather than actually to acquire afoothold there themselves.    4.  The history of Italian  relations with the Yemen  during recent years hasnot been of such a nature as to  encourage the Italians  to embark lightly on anadventure in that country.  The Imam has on the whole  maintained an increasingly      8590   [13194]
suspicious and independent attitude towards them, though not sufficiently so togive them a pretext for attacking him.   The Imam is now on very friendly terms with us, and has more than once asked our advice as to the attitude which  heshould adopt.  It is true that we have been careful not  to give him any  formalundertaking that we would go to his assistance if he were attacked by Italy, andwe could not well do so without embarking on a general Anglo-Italian war.  ButItaly&apos;s undertaking to us not to  attempt to establish herself in the Yemen is soclear and Yemeni interests are so bound up with those of the Aden Protectoratethat it is difficult to see how the  Italians could violate this particular obligationand  attack the Yemen without directly challenging His Majesty&apos;s Government.     5.  As  regards Saudi Arabia, the Italians have for  some time been makingadvances to King Ibn Saud  and have recently presented him with six aeroplanesfree  of  charge and  (there is every reason to believe) unconditionally.   Ibn Saudhas  accepted these  aeroplanes, which  he badly needs, since the  finances of his country do not permit him  to pay the heavy price which would be required inorder to purchase them from any other country.  He has, however, told us (sofar  as we can see, accurately) of  all that has passed between him and  theItalians, and has either  asked our advice or at least kept us informed at every stage.   Our advice  has always been  that he should not  provoke  a  quarrel withthe Italians, and that he should keep on as  good terms with them as was possible without  actively assisting them in their conflict with Abyssinia.   Saudi Arabianot being a member of the  League,  no question  of the application of sanctionshas  arisen.  Ibn Saud enquired  at an early stage  of the conflict between Italyand  Abyssinia whether, if  he were openly to side  against the Italians, HisMajesty&apos;s Government would guarantee to assist him in the case of any aggressionon their part against his territory.  It  was impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to  give so  categorical  an undertaking, and it is largely as  a  result of  our inability to do this that Ibn  Saud has gone as far as he has in &quot; keeping in &quot; withthe Italians.     6.  But all our evidence suggests that Ibn Saud is still profoundly suspicious of Italian intentions.   He has recently concluded what  is virtually a defensivealliance with Iraq, and at one time (no doubt while he still hoped that he mightget some protection thereby), he seemed anxious to  apply for membership of theLeague  of Nations.   The Italians are well  aware of the great importance whichHis  Majesty&apos;s Government  attach to  the  maintenance of the independence  ofSaudi Arabia.  It is possible, but  unlikely, that they may quite wrongly regard the  recent Saudi-Iraqi  Treaty   as having  been engineered by  His Majesty&apos;.?Government with a view to creating  a solid Arab bloc against them, and that, inthat  case, they might try to argue that His Majesty&apos;s Government had alreadyvirtually violated the Borne understanding, though such  an argument would,  ofcourse, be untenable. But any direct  attempt on their part to establish themselves on the Red Sea coast of that kingdom would be an even more direct challenge toHis  Majesty&apos;s Government than an attempt to acquire a foothold in the Yemen.In either case the Italians would be dependent on sea-borne supplies, which wouldhave to  go through  the Suez Canal.  This  might make their position even moreprecarious in  the event of His Majesty&apos;s Government deciding  to accept theirchallenge.   They would, moreover,  be faced  with a solid phalanx of Moslemopposition, and perhaps Ibn Saud might even be  able to rouse the tribes of theirNorth African colonies against  them.   Certainly, the reaction in Egypt wouldbe strong.     7.  In  all the. circumstances, although the Italians are not  likely to  be deterred by treaty obligations, and are capable of  many acts of folly, it seemsquestionable whether they would  embark on so dangerous and probably unprofit-able  an  adventure.  The harbours on  the east coast of the  Red Sea are mostly badopen roadsteads,  unsuitable as good  bases  for establishing effective control overthe Red Sea.     8.  The Italians may try to increase their influence in Arabia by every means in their power, but they are unlikely to  succeed so long as Ibn Saud and the Imamremain  in power.  Should any part of Arabia fail into chaos or  anarchy  on  the death or disappearance of either  of these rulers, the situation might be modifiedconsiderably.
ROME CONVERSATIONS OF 1927.Record of Conversations which have taken /place in Rome between His Excellency    the Right Hon. Sir Ronald Graham, G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., C.B.,His Britannic    Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome, and Brigadier-General Sir Gilbert Clayton,    K.C.M.G., K.B.E., C.B., on behalf of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government,    and His Excellency II Cavaliere Jacopo Gasparini, Governor of Eritrea, and    His  Excellency II Grand&apos; Vff. Raffaele  Guariglia, Director-General at the    Ministry for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Italian  Government.    THE  above-mentioned  delegates  have,  under  instructions  from  theirrespective Governments, discussed certain questions regarding British and Italianinterests  in Southern Arabia and the Red Sea.    The  delegates, acting  under their instructions that the respective policies ofthe two Governments in Southern Arabia and the Red Sea should be pursued ina spirit of  friendly co-operation and  developed  on  parallel though independentlines, have reached the conclusion that their Governments are in agreement on thefollowing points :     1. That it  is in the common interest of the two Governments to pursue apolicy of pacification in order to avoid so far as possible conflicts between thevarious Arab chiefs.    2. That  such influence as the two  Governments may  be in a position toexercise respectively with Ibn Saud,  the Imam Yahia and the Idrisi of  Asir,should be directed towards eliminating causes of conflict in order  to arrive, ifpossible,  at pacific and friendly settlements between those chiefs.    3. That while continuing to exert their influence in the cause of peace, thetwo Governments should not intervene in any conflict, which, despite the efforts ofthe two Governments towards pacification, may break out between those chiefs.    4. That the guiding principle in British policy in the Red  Sea is the securityof imperial communications with India and  the East.   For this  purpose HisBritannic Majesty&apos;s Government regard it as a vital imperial  interest that noEuropean Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea, andmore particularly on Kamaran or the  Farsan Islands,  and that neither Kamarannor the Farsan Islands shall fall into the hands of an unfriendly Arab ruler.    That, on the other hand, it is the  interest of Italy, in view of her possessionson the western  coast of the Red Sea, that no European Power  should establishitself on  the Arabian shore of the Red Sea, or on Kamaran or the Farsan Islands,and that neither Kamaran nor the Farsan Islands should fall into  the hands ofan unfriendly Arab ruler.                                          . -    5. That  there should  be  economic and commercial freedom  on the Arabiancoast and the islands of the Red Sea for citizens and subjects of the two countries and that the protection which such citizens and subjects may legitimately expectfrom  their respective Governments should not  assume  a political  character orcomplexion.    6. That the presence of British officials at Kamaran is solely for the purposeof  securing  the sanitary  service of  the pilgrimage to  Mecca,  but that for adminsitrative  reasons His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government  do not consider it possible  at present  to  agree  to the Italian  request for the participation  of an italian doctor  in the quarantine service.   But since the  Italian Governmentmaintain their point of view in this matter, His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Governmentare disposed to reconsider the question when the number of pilgrims originatingin Italian colonies or possessions  increases to such an extent as  better to justifythe presence of  an Italian  doctor.    7. That it is in the common  interest of  the two Governments to use theirrespective influence with the Arab chiefs in such a manner as to safeguard as faras may be  possible  the mutual interests of  Italy and Great  Britain,  and that,therefore, it is  desirable that the  two Governments should  maintain close  touchwith each other in all questions affecting the Red Sea and Southern  Arabia, inorder to  avoid misunderstandings between them or  misapprehension on the partof the Arab chiefs in regard to the policies which the  tw^o  Governments intend tofollow in the above-mentioned, areas.
