THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy  No.CP. 131 (36).CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATY  CONVERSATIONS.         Memorandum  by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    IN pursuance of the decision taken by the Cabinet in their meeting on the6th May, the Cabinet Committee met on the 7th May to go into the question ofthe insertion of a time limit in the prospective treaty with Egypt.  As a resultof the Committee&apos;s discussion, which are recorded in a paper already circulatedto my colleagues, the view was taken that Parliamentary opinion in this countrymakes it necessary to omit from such a treaty any provision investing any third party (whether the Council of the League of Nations or  any other person or body.)with the power of deciding  what troops His Majesty&apos;s Government  should maintain in the Canal Zone in order to render the Canal safe, if at the conclusionof the fixed period the United Kingdom and Egypt were not able to agree on theterms of the revised treaty.  The  Committee therefore  decided to recommend tothe Cabinet that instructions should be sent to Sir Miles Lampson to  endeavourto secure the agreement of the Egyptian delegation to treaty provisions on thelines suggested  in Form B of the memorandum prepared for the Cabinet by theHome Secretary and circulated to them as No. A.E.C. (36) 2.  The committee recommended that the state of Parliamentary opinion should be explained to HisMajesty&apos;s High Commissioner with the grounds on which this opinion was based.I undertook  to prepare  a  draft  telegram  of  instructions on  the basis of theCommittee&apos;s recommendations : it forms the annex to  this memorandum.    2.   Though the Committee  was  of the  opinion  that no  treaty would  beaccepted by Parliament which did not, at  least,  provide for the position of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the terms proposed in the draft, they recognised thatit might be impossible to secure Egyptian acceptance of such terms and that thenegotiations might break down on this point, with the result that no treaty wouldbe concluded, and His Majesty&apos;s Government  would  be  left with  a difficultpolitical position with regard to Egypt and a somewhat uncertain legal position with regard to  the Suez Canal.    The Committee considered that it would  benecessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government, after appreciating the probable resultsof the failure to secure a treaty, to take a decision whether  they were prepared to face these results.    3.   It  may be of assistance to my colleagues if I therefore review  shortlywhat these consequences are likely to be.  It is certain that  there will be a seriousdisturbance  of Egyptian opinion  if the negotiations break down.   Reasons forthis may be found in the terms of the draft  treaty of 1930, and  the contrastbetween them and what is now insisted on by His Majesty&apos;s Government, in thefacts that His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed to enter on  the present conversationsafter a period of agitation in Egypt;  that the agitation had led to the formationof a United Front of all political parties and, concurrently, of  a neutral Govern-ment and a  body of negotiators representative of all parties for the purpose of negotiating a treaty; that His Majesty&apos;s Government had  for long declared thatthey would be ready to conclude a treaty with a Government really representativeof the Egyptian  people;  that the Egyptian  Government have been  given  noreason to suppose hitherto  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government would demand any      8589   [13186]                                                B
 departure so radical.as that now demanded from the terms of the draft treaty of  1930 in respect  of  the  duration of  the  treaty and. of the reference  to the Council of the League of Nations of a dispute connected with the terms oh which it should be revised when the period of  its duration  came to an end.  Moreover, the death of King Euad has removed not only a factor of general stability from the political scene  in Egypt,  but  the chief element in  Egyptian political life which could successfully balance and restrain the extremism of the Wafd.  And this has occurred at a moment when the Wafd are returning  to power with an overwhelming majority, and when  the Regency Council is likely to be such that it will be  able to exert little influence  upon the Government.  So great is the revulsion of Egyptian feeling likely to be that the possibility of grave agitation must be taken into account.   His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner has  reported that,  unless any  demand on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government which leads to breakdown can be accepted by sensible Egyptian opinion as reasonable, wide- spread and violent disturbances are, in his opinion, inevitable and likely to reach proportions necessitating the  intervention of  His Majesty&apos;s  forces.   It  is my duty  to state  that  it  is  highly  doubtful  that insistence by His  Majesty&apos;s Government on  their present view  would be regarded in Egypt as reasonable. As opposed to   this, the  Egyptian negotiators, and  still  more  the ignorant public, are  likely  to  feel that  by the offers  they  have  made  over and above what was contained in the draft treaty of 1930, they have gone an appre- appreciable way towards meeting  the  views of His Majesty&apos;s Government  on the necessities of the changed international  and military position.  These offers, as my colleagues are aware, already involve modification in favour of His Majesty&apos;s Government of the number  of British troops to be stationed in the Canal  which the Egyptian delegation were  prepared  to accept in 1930; agreement that His Majesty&apos;s Government might send  reinforcements to  Egypt without limit in an apprehended emergency; the provision of new and improved means of communi- cation and facilities for the British forces to train in  the  Western Desert.  They may also include, in view of the evacuation of the Cairo area, the maintenance of British troops in Alexandria, whereas, in 1930, withdrawal from both cities was agreed  to.   In coming  to their decision, therefore, His Majesty&apos;s  Government must  take into account  the probability of these disturbances.   The consequences of such a situation may well be that it would not be possible to find any Egyptian Government capable, on the one hand, of maintaining  law and order by their own resources, or, on the other hand, willing to do so with the sole support of British force.   Egyptian opinion will be likely to take the view in these circum- stances that His Majesty&apos;s  Government  have no real intention of concluding a treaty with Egypt and that they will always raise their terms to a point sufficient to make negotiations fail.   In such conditions not  only would  His Majesty&apos;s Government have to  undertake the restoration and maintenance of law and  order, but also the government of the  country in defiance of  national opinion in Egypt. To  accomplish this large forces would be necessary,  perhaps approximating to the force which was required for this purpose in 1919, when five infantry divisions and one cavalry division were required and a request made for a further division of infantry.  Moreover, at that time there was in Egypt a very numerous British civil service, which has  since then been reduced to a mere fraction of its former numbers.   I need not labour the point how undesirable such a situation would be at  any time, and particularly after the events of the past year, from a political point of view; but I would particularly call the attention of my colleagues  to the considerations which might render  its strategical effects most serious, and in fact  gravely jeopardise that very security of Imperial communications which it  is  our  object to secure.    Failure   to  negotiate  a treaty  with Egypt, followed by disturbances in that  country, their  suppression by  British  force and the government of Egypt by  His Majesty&apos;s Government by  force and against the will  of  the Egyptian  people,  would be  represented throughout the Arab  Near  East  possibly as  a  sign of  British bad   faith,   certainly as  a  proof of   British Imperialism pursued  at the   expense  of  a weakerMohametan country.  It might well be that, faced with what  they regarded as a proof of British hostility to Arabian  aims and aspirations, it would be the signal for an outburst in Palestine and Syria.  It could hardly fail to have serious repercussions in Iraq and in Saudi Arabia.  The influence of events and opinion in Egypt on the rest of  the  Arab Near East is  great.   The Egyptian newspaper A hram, which is of Nationalist tendency and not friendly to British policy,  is
the most widely read journal throughout the Mohametan countries of that area.His Majesty&apos;s  Government are concerned  to ensure  that their communicationsthrough  Egypt, and  particularly through  the  Suez Canal, should be  secure inthe event of possible emergency farther to the East, and it is because of this thatthey have adopted their present view with regard to the duration of a  treaty with Egypt, and any  provision therein for reference of certain matters connectedwith their position on the Canal to  the League of Nations and envisaged thepossibility of failing to get a treaty through insistence thereon.  It seems necessarythat they should be clear in their minds that the security of their communications,which  they  desire to  ensure in the case of an emergency farther East, can beprovided for without  a treaty as well as or better than with a treaty, which would include articles regarding the duration  of the agreement and reference to an outside party which Egypt could  accept.  For such an emergency it would seem that British communications through Egypt must be safe from the very  firstmoment (and before there had been time in which to mobilise our full resources and expand our forces from their peace-time strength) in order that such forces as may be required may pass freely to the scene of action.  It is a matter forconsideration whether in  such circumstances  His Majesty&apos;s Government coulddispose both the  forces necessary to  hold down Egypt  and  protect  imperial communications from danger from  within, and those that may be required forthe emergency  farther East.  To this must be added the serious possibility ofdisturbances in other Arab countries  close to our lines of communications withwhich  it would be necessary to cope,  and the possibility of attacks on our linesof communications in Egypt a.nd  elsewhere by  an unfriendly Great Power  suchas Italy.  The  decision which is before His Majesty&apos;s Government is, therefore,one of the most grave importance.    4.  Since the meeting of the Cabinet  Committee on the 7th, the followingsuggestion has  been made  to me, and,  in view of the extreme gravity of a  break-down of the Treaty negotiations, I feel I  ought to lay it before my colleagues.The suggestion is that, in place of  the sentence referring to the Council  of theLeague of Nations in the Duration Article of the Treaty (Article 16), which theCommittee recommended  should be deleted, the following provision should beinserted  : &quot;If the High Contracting  Parties are unable  to agree on the terms ofthe revised  Treaty,  the dispute shall be submitted-, at the request of either ofthem, to  a conciliation commission constituted in accordance with Articles 5 and of the General Act for the Pacific  Settlement  of International Disputes  drawnup at Geneva on the 20th September, 1928.  The said commission shall deal withthe matter in accordance with Articles 7 to 16 of the said General Act.&quot;  HisMajesty&apos;s Government acceded to  the  General Act on  the 21st May, 1931, subjectto certain conditions  which are set out together with the text of the Act itself inTreaty Series No.  32  of 1931, which is annexed  hereto.    Under the  provisions of this Act the conclusions of a conciliation commission are recommendations only.  They have no  binding force upon the parties to thedispute.   The commission consists of  five members, of which each of the partiesnominate one and the other three are nominated by agreement from the nationals of third  Powers.  Article 6 provides  the procedure in the event of a failure to select these  three members by the  common agreement of the Contracting Parties.It is just possible that such a provision might enable the Egyptian negotiatorsto accept the Treaty, when without it they would refuse to do  so.  On the otherhand,  since the functions of the  commission are advisory only,  it could  not besaid in  Parliament  that  His Majesty&apos;s  Government had handed over  to thedecision  of a third party decisions upon such a vital  matter as the numbers anddispositions of  British troops in the Canal Zone.    If this  suggestion was adopted, it is a question for consideration whether itwould not be advisable to  re-insert in the duration Article the  phrase &quot; it being understood  that the  position of His Britannic Majesty in relation to the suez canal* and the continued  maintenance and protection in all circumstances of the    * The words  &quot; position of His Britannic Majesty in relation to the Suez Canal &quot; in this phrase,  being  the  same as those used at the beginning  of the sentence in Article 9, which theCabinet Committee recommended should be  retained (as the provision by which the egyptian government recognises His Majesty&apos;s Governments right to protect the Canal), it follo-ws as amatter  of  legal interpretation that reference must  be made to  Article 9 to ascertain what this position was.  The provision in  Article 9  then shows that it is a position under which the  King ofEgypt recognises  the right of  His Britannic Majesty to take  all  the steps that he considers necessary  for the protection of the safety of, and the freedom of navigation in, the Suez Canal.
essential communications of  His  Britannic Majesty  shall be  recognised  and provided for in any revision of the present Treaty,&quot; or some other suitable phrase.This phrase was cut out of  the text; recommended  by the  Cabinet Committeebecause it  was not necessary  when there was no arbitral body.  Although theconciliation commission has  not  the powers  of. an arbitral  body, it may benevertheless desirable to ensure that it must make its recommendations on thebasis of these two principles.  The point, however, is, of course, not so vital whenthe dispute is being referred  to a body which can only recommend and cannotgive a binding decision, and the inclusion of. this phrase will, no doubt add to thedifficulties of negotiation..

ANNEX.                  Draft Telegram to Sir M. Lampson (Cairo).        &apos; (Immediate.)                                   Foreign Office, May  - , 1936. a     YOUR telegram No. 371 and my telegram No. 22.4.                &apos;&quot;   -     1.   Cabinet considered question  of duration of treaty  to-day; and  it was decided that it would be necessary to insist that this  should be dealt with by an article which made it clear that the provisions of the treaty continued in force until replaced  by  a new agreement between  the contracting parties.  Cabinet were unable to agree to the inclusion in the treaty of any provision giving power to the  Council  of  the League of Nations to  settle the  terms of the new treaty in the  absence of an agreement between the contracting parties, even if it were stipulated in advance that the new treaty must safeguard the position of His Britannic Majesty  in relation to the Canal and the  safety of British imperial communications.     2.   In view of this decision the  duration article of  the treaty would have to be on the following lines : &apos;&apos; At any time after the expiration of a period of 20 years from the coming into force of the treaty, the  high  contracting parties will, at the request of either of them, enter into negotiations, with a view to such revision of its terms by agreement between them as may be appropriate in  the circumstances as they then exist.&quot;     3.   In addition, it  is  necessary to include in the  article corresponding to article  9 of the  1930 draft or in some other suitable position earlier in the treaty the  following provision:  &quot;In view^ of the position  of His Britannic Majesty in relation to the Suez Canal, His Majesty the King of Egypt recognises that His Britannic Majesty  may,  through the Commanders of his forces, take  all steps necessary  for  the maintenance  and  the  security  of,  and of  the freedom  of navigation in, the said Canal.&quot;   (See my  despatches Nos. 341 of the 15th April and 381  of  the 27th April, for  the  reasons  for, and  an explanation of, this provision.)     4.   In sending these texts in paragraphs 2 and  3, there is  no intention to tie you down to these exact words.  Other words may  be used provided that they cover equally well the requirements in paragraph 1 above  in  the case of  the former  and the points explained in my despatches Nos. 341 and 381 as regards the latter.     5.   In  arriving at this decision with regard to the duration of the treaty the  Cabinet did not overlook  the proposals  in a  contrary  sense  contained  in article 7 of the 1928 draft treaty and article 14 of the  1930 draft, nor the similar provisions of the Treaty of Alliance with Iraq nor the  opinion  which you have more than once expressed that it wras extremely doubtful whether it would  be possible to persuade the Egyptian negotiators to accept such a solution as regards the duration of the treaty, nor again  were they blind  to  the great advantages of the conclusion of a treaty with  Egypt and the  awkward consequences of a failure  to conclude a treaty.  The reasons for this decision are as follows :      6.  Whatever might have been the case a year ago there is in present circum- stamces  no prospect of securing the passage through  Parliament of any treaty article envisaging the reference to the League of Nations, or, indeed, to any third party, of the question of the conditions under which, in a treaty revised at the end.  of  twenty years,  a  dispute  regarding the  terms on  which the continued maintenance and protection in all circumstances of the essential communications of His Britannic Majesty should be provided for (see paragraphs 1 and 2 above). As you will appreciate, the recent course of events  has  made  the League  of Nations, in the eyes of public opinion, an uncertain quantity, the composition and rules of which and the  functions of whose organs may in the  future be very different from what they are now.   Moreover, the general international situation.has become  such that Parliament would refuse to endorse any treaty by which decisions as to the safeguarding of Imperial communications would be left in anyother hands than those of His Majesty&apos;s Government.  The view will be held that
this country cannot possibly afford to do so.  Moreover, a member of one of theDominion Governments has just very forcibly stated this view, and emphasised the fact that were His Majesty&apos;s Government to agree to such a provision, thedeepest anxiety and resentment would be caused.  The  representative of anotherDominion has expressed a similar, though not so strong a view, with regard tothe reaction of opinion in the Dominion which he represents.     7.  If on proposing  to Nahas Pasha articles with regard to the Canal onthe lines of  those suggested above his Excellency objects to the omission of aprovision for reference to an outside party, you  should explain that, in view ofthe situation created  in the  international sphere by the events of the last year,Parliament  would inevitably reject any such.provision.  At the  same time you may inform  his Excellency that His Majesty&apos;s Government are still  willing toinclude in  the treaty an  article corresponding to article 13 of the  1930 draftproviding that disputes  as regards  the  interpretation and application of thetreaty (as opposed to the decision as to the terms of the revision) should be settled in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations.     8.  While I fully  appreciate  the difficulties of the task thus imposed onyou, I trust you will make every effort to induce the Egyptian  negotiators to agreeto provisions on the lines  indicated by the Cabinefs decision.  You may refer torather different position of the League of Nations to-day than  in 1930, but withoutindicating more than you can help any loss of confidence in the League on the partof His Majesty&apos;s Government  or  any expectation that the provisions of theCovenant will be changed.  You might add that in present  world conditions itis impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to  agree beforehand to submit mattersso vital to the safety  of the Empire to any outside body.  You should not refer to the views  expressed by  representatives of Dominion Governments.

Disputes for the settlement of which a special procedure is laid down in other conventions in force between the  parties to  the dispute shall be settled in conformity with the provisions of those conventions.    2.   The present General Act shall not affect any  agreements in force by  which conciliation procedure is  established between  the Parties or they are bound by obligations to resort to  arbitration or judicial settlement  which ensure the settlement of the dispute.  If, however,  these agreements provide only for a procedure of con- ciliation, after  such procedure has  been followed without result,  the provisions of the present General Act  concerning judicial settlement or arbitration shall be applied in so far as the parties have acceded thereto.                           ARTICLE 30.    If  a party  brings  before  a  Conciliation Commission  a dispute which the other party,  relying on  conventions in force between  the parties, has  submitted  to  the  Permanent  Court of  International Justice or an  Arbitral  Tribunal,  the  Commission shall  defer con- sideration of the dispute until the Court or the Arbitral Tribunal has pronounced upon the conflict of competence.  The  same  rule shall apply if the  Court  or the  Tribunal is seized of the case by one  of the parties during  the  conciliation proceedings.                           ARTICLE 81.    1.

91   2.  In  such a  case, the  party which  desires to resort  to the procedures laid down in the  present  General Act must notify the other party of its intention within a period of one year from the date of the aforementioned decision.                           ARTICLE 32.   If, in a judicial sentence or arbitral award, it is  declared that a judgment,  or  a measure  enjoined by  a court of  law or  other authority  of one of the parties to  the  dispute, is wholly or in part contrary to international law, and if the constitutional law of that party does not permit or only partially permits the consequences of the judgment or measure in question to be annulled, the parties agree that the judicial sentence or arbitral award  shall grant the injured party  equitable satisfaction.                           ARTICLE 33.   1.  In all  cases where  a dispute forms  the object of arbitration or judicial proceedings,  and particularly if the  question on which the parties differ arises out of acts already committed or on the point of being committed, the Permanent Court of International Justice,  acting in accordance  with  Article 41 of its Statute,  or the Arbitral Tribunal, shall lay down within the shortest possible  time the provisional measures to be adopted.  The parties to the dispute shall be bound to accept  such measures.   2.  If  the  dispute is brought before a Conciliation Commission, the latter may recommend to the parties the  adoption  of  such provisional measures  as it  considers suitable.   3.  The parties undertake to  abstain  from all measures likely to react prejudicially  upon  the execution of the judicial or arbitral decision or upon the arrangements proposed by the  Conciliation Commission and, in  general,  to  abstain  from any  sort of  action whatsoever which may aggravate or extend the dispute.                           ARTICLE 34.   Should a  dispute  arise  between more than two  Parties to the present General Act,  the following rules shall be observed for the application of  the forms  of procedure described in the foregoing provisions :   (a) In  the  case  of conciliation  procedure,  a special  commission shall invariably be  constituted.  The composition of such commis- sion  shall differ according as the parties all have separate interests or as two or more of  their number act  together.   In  the former  case,   the parties  shall  each  appoint  onecommissioner  and shall jointly  appoint commissioners nationals of third Powers not parties to the dispute, whose number shall alwaysexceed by one the  number of commissioners  appointed separatelyby the parties.
   In the  second case, the&apos;parties who act together shall appointtheir commissioner jointly  by agreement between themselves andshall combine with the other party or parties in appointing thirdcommissioners.   In either event, the parties,  unless they agree otherwise, shallapply Article 5 and the following articles of the present Act, so faras they  are compatible with the provisions of the present article.   (b)  In  the  case  of  judicial  procedure,  the  Statute of  thePermanent Court of International  Justice shall apply.   (c) In the case of  arbitral  procedure, if agreement is not securedas to the composition of  the tribunal,  in the case of the disputesmentioned in Article  17 each party shall have the right, by meansof an application, to submit the  dispute to the Permanent  Courtof International Justice;  in the  case of the disputes mentioned inArticle 21, the above Article 22 and following articles  shall apply,but each party having separate interests shall appoint one arbitratorand the  number of arbitrators separately appointed by the partiesto the  dispute  shall always  be one less  than that of the  otherarbitrators.                           ARTICLE  35.   1.   The present General Act shall be applicable as  between theParties  thereto,  even though  a third Power, whether a  party to theAct or not, has an interest in the dispute.   2.  In  conciliation procedure,  the parties may  agree  to  invitesuch third Power to intervene.                           ARTICLE  36.   1.   In  judicial or arbitral procedure, if a third Power should consider that it  has  an  interest of a legal nature which may beeffected by the decision in the ease, it may submit  to the PermanentCourt of International Justice or to the arbitral tribunal a request to intervene as  a third Party.   2.   It will be for the Court or the tribunal  to decide upon this request.                           ARTICLE  37.   1.   Whenever the construction of a convention to which states other than those concerned in the case are parties is  in  question,the Eegistrar of the Permanent Court of International Justice or thearbitral tribunal shall notify  all  such States forthwith.   2.   Every State  so notified  has the right to intervene in theproceedings; but, if  it uses  this  right, the construction  given  bythe decision will be binding upon it.
