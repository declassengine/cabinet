-4 0CPTTIS DOGirMBNT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT )                           CABINETP.117 (36 )     DEFENCE PROGRAMME - LABOUR  ISSUES  INVOLVED.               Memorandum by the Minister  of Health.               On consideration of the  papers  CP.96(36 )  and  CP.57 (36),     Memoranda submitted by the Minister of Labour,  I think it  desirable     to call the attention of my colleagues to  the  repercussions  of  the     defence programmes on the work of  my  Department, and particularly     on the execution of our housing programmes.               It has been the policy of the Government to rely on     unassisted private enterprise for  the meeting  of our normal     housing needs, and to concentrate  the operations of  Local     Authorities on those housing deficiencies  which will not be  met by     the operations of private enterprise, the  provision  of new houses     to replace unfit houses and to secure the  abatement  of overcrowding,     The success of this general policy is indicated by the remarkable     increase in the  number of houses  built by private enterprise     without assistance.              Year ended 30th September 1931    129,790                &quot;    &quot;    &quot;       &quot;     1932    130,830                &quot;    &quot;    &quot;       &quot;     1933    166,644                &quot;    &quot;    &quot;       &quot;     1934    257,746                &quot;    &quot;    &quot;       &quot;     1935    27 5,002     The activity thus displayed by the building industry has been     an important factor in the national recovery of the  last few years.               During these years the number of houses built  by Local     Authorities with the aid of Exchequer assistance has been  very     &apos; much  smaller, ranging from 66,434  in  the  year  ended  30th September     1932  to 32,682 in the year ended 30th September 1935.    The     position during these years was that  in accordance with  the  general     policy of the Government the unrestricted subsidy to Local     Authorities was being terminated (the final date for completion     of houses under that subsidy being 30th June 1934) and the
programme for slum clearance being developed.    The latterprogrammes are now well on their way,  the  number of houses under construction by Local Authorities is now showing a substantial increase and houses are at present being completed at  the rate ofabout 4,000 houses per month, a figure which ought to  be  further increased in the near future.          The aim of the Government to secure  the abolition ofslums and overcrowding by the execution of definite programmeswithin a period of a few years necessitates the continuance ofthis expansion of the recent rate of municipal building forseveral years to come.   The slum clearance programmes call forthe erection of approximately 300,000 new houses;  the  amountof overcrowding is not yet fully known, but I  am assuming for themoment that the deficiency of houses to be made up is  in theneighbourhood of 200,000.   There is thus  required a total of500,000 houses of which about 80,000 have  been completed andanother 50,000 are under construction.   It would be my aim as amatter of housing policy to complete these programmes  in about fiveyears which would mean the provision of about  70,000 houses per year.   The public atmosphere is favourable to the execution ofthese schemes, the Local Authorities are applying themselveswholeheartedly to this work, and the price of  money and cost ofbuilding are favourable.   The success of  the programme depends onthe continuance of this position and during the past few  months in particular there has been evidence  that the building industry isalready fully occupied and unlikely, with  its  present  resources,to be able to carry any additional burdens.   Unemployment amongbricklayers, tilers and plasterers, the  key crafts from  the housebuilding point of view fell in March 1936  to 4.6$, 12$ and 8$respectively as compared with 5.3$, 17.5$  and  11.4$ in March 1935,and there are already indications that the progress of municipalhousing schemes is being delayed by the shortage of skilled labour,                             2.
          It has  been generally  thought  that  the  remarkableoutput of houses  by private  enterprise cannot be  maintained forany great length  of time:  the number  completed during  the yearended 30th September 1935  did indeed decline  to 125,593 ascompared with 149,409 and  136,965 in the two  preceding  half years:figures for the half year  ended  31st March will be available  inthe next two or three weeks  but  there  is as yet no  indication ofany serious drop.          Moreover, the information available from plans approvedindicates the maintenance  of a high rate of activity in thebuilding industry.    I should therefore  anticipate that theimposition on the building industry of substantial additionaltasks such, as will, I understand, be necessitated by the defence programme, must react unfavourably on  the expansion  or  indeed themaintenance of the present rate  of building under the municipalhousi ng pro gramme s.          The two main objects which I regard as  essential  are -     (1)  that the programmes for slum clearance  and the abatement          of overcrowding should remain a definite  part of  the          Government&apos;s policy j     (2)  that  the houses to be  built  under these programmes          should  be built on terms which will enable them to  be          let at  low rents without imposing any higher  burdens on          the taxpayers or ratepayers  than are provided for by the          existing legislation.          It must be to the  common interest of the  defence programme and the housing programme to avoid  any  competition  for building labour which will force up the  cost  of building, and I amwatching carefully the tenders  received by Local  Authorities  forany indications of a development of this kind.          If we are to avoid competition and  unnecessaryexpenditure on the defence programme and the  housing programme the building work over which the Government can exercise control should in my opinion be coordinated and I suggest for the
consideration of my colleagues that somp liaison machinery should be established for this purpose.    From the  housing point!of view it is important for me to know as soon as possible theprobable extent of the demands to be made upon the  buildingindustry as a result of the defence programmes, the parts of thejlcountry which would be mainly concerned, and the time at whichthese demands would become urgent and substantial:   the mutualinterchange of information of this kind will be essential if weare effectively to co-operate and avoid overlapping in theexecution of our several tasks.          There is one other aspect of the defence  programme towhich I should like at this stage to direct the attention of my.colleagues.   The criticism has been made from time to time thatour housing and industrial developments do not proceed inaccordance with any ordered plans  this criticism usuallytakes the form of recommending a Central Planning Board but therelations of such a Board to the existing Departments have never been clearly defined.   My colleagues will remember the references made to this question in Mr. Lloyd George 1sMemorandum on Unemployment and Reconstruction and I haverecently received a report in a similar sense made  by aCommittee under the Chairmanship of Lord Amulree.   It waspointed out in the Government1s reply to Mr. Lloyd George lastyear that such a proposal appeared to be impossible withoutsubsidy or compulsion and that the application of compulsionor subsidy to industry to secure this object involved a fundamental change in the relations  of Government  to industry which could not in the opinion of the Government be justified by any advantages to be foreseen.          The expansion of various industries which will result from the defence programme appear likely however to bring theGovernment into more direct relations with these industries
than, would ordinarily be the cases   and where new buildings are to be Constructed for the purpose of meeting the needsof the Government&apos;s programme, it would be appropriate  for theGovernment to exercise any control which was considered desirableover the location of these new buildings.   The special position which thus arises gives a practicable opportunity &quot;within alimited sphere of carrying out a piece of national planningwhich is admittedly impracticable in the usual relations of theCentral Government to industry and to the Local Authorities.          I suggest for the consideration of my colleagues thatthe opportunity thus presented should not be neglected.   clearly the overriding considerations in determining the location of new industries for the defence programme will be the needs  of theprogramme itself, but in my opinion every attempt should be madein the construction of new buildings and the provision  ofadditional employment to avoid the unplanned development and theinconveniences attendant upon it which have been the subject of criticism in many new industrial developments.   The relationship of industry to available labour and available housing accommodation is of primary importance, as also is the method ofsiting of industry in particular districts.          Here again the establishment of some liaison  whichwould enable us to co-operate in avoiding errors and makingthe best and. most efficient use of our national resourcesappears of vital importance and it is hardly necessary  forme to add that if this liaison is to be of value it should beset up at the earliest possible stage in the planning of our-defence programme.
