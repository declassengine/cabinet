Copy No.CP. 119  (36).CABINET.OIL DEVELOPMENT IN  THE  COLONIAL EMPIRE.                        POLICY OF BRITISH CONTROL.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    IN accordance with  the policy laid down some thirty years ago  it has beenthe usual practice to grant oil concessions on Crown lands in the Colonies and protectorates  only to  Companies  under British control.  The desirability  of modifying this policy  and admitting foreign companies to the exploitation  of oil in the Colonies and Protectorates has been under consideration for many years,partly with the purpose of strengthening the position of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in pressing for the admission of British Companies in the exploitation of oil in foreign countries, and partly to meet the wishes of certain Colonies, whereit has been alleged that development has been hindered by the exclusion of foreignenterprise.    2.   A memorandum was prepared by the Petroleum Department of the Boardof Trade in 1930  in  which it was proposed that foreign-controlled  companies should in future be allowed to operate subject to certain conditions.   This policy was approved  in principle by the Government of the day in October, 1930, butdetails  were reserved until after the  matter  had been discussed at the ImperialConference of that year.  It was not, in fact, found possible to discuss the matter at the  Imperial Conference, and, in  consequence, no immediate general action was taken.   The embargo on the operation of foreign companies was, however,removed  in  the special  case of British Guiana by the same  Government  inDecember, 1930.    3.   Since  then the  matter  has   continued to form the subject of  inter-departmental discussion, and agreement has been reached on the precise conditions under which it is proposed that the embargo  should be raised.  The question  ofprinciple was also considered in connection with the United Kingdom  Petroleum(Production) Act, 1934,  and the Regulations issued  under  it.   The  particular question  of admission  of applications from  foreigners or  a foreign-controlledcompany was dealt  with in paragraph 5 of a  memorandum circulated by thePresident of  the Board of Trade   (CP.  83  (35) ),  dealing  with  the  draft regulations under the  Act, and the proposal to admit such applications subjectto safeguards  was approved by  the  Cabinet on  the  17th April, 1935 (cabinet conclusions 24 (35)).    4.   I now propose to announce that in continuation of the  policy indicatedin the recent United Kingdom Act and Regulations, under which foreign partici-pation is admitted under  stated conditions, the embargo on foreign participation in oil development in the territories for the administration of which the Secretaryof State for the Colonies is responsible (other than Mandated Territories, to which,      T13132]
of course, the &quot; British control &quot; policy does not apply) will be lifted on similar conditions.  The precise conditions which I propose to prescribe are as follows : -     (i) Terms of existing leases to be maintained and their transfer made subject           (as at present) to Government approval.     (2) Concessions only to be granted or assigned to foreigners or foreign           controlled  companies  in  cases  where  foreigners are  citizens of           countries granting similar advantages to British nationals.     (3) The grant of the concession to be made to a company registered in British           territory.     (4) Majority of  employees and some of the Directors and  the  chief local           representative to be British subjects.     (5) As  soon as the output of oil reaches a specified amount,  at least  50  per           cent, of the oil obtained to be refined on British territory and the plant           to  be capable of producing  fuel oil suitable for Admiralty use.     (6) The Government to retain right of pre-emption in case of emergency.     (7) Provision to be included in the concession requiring that it shall in fact           be  worked.     The last three conditions will apply equally to all concessionaires irrespective of nationality.     5.  I propose to make this announcement through the medium of a question in the House  of Commons,  and unless any of my colleagues see any objection  aQuestion will  be arranged as soon as  possible.   My reply  will indicate that, inorder to give  adequate notice of the change of policy and  to allow time for  thepreparation of the necessary amendments to the various Regulations, it is proposedto fix the 1st June, 1938, as the date from which they shall simultaneously become effective.   ,6.  These proposals are the result of Cabinet decisions taken some time ago,but the most recent developments as regards general Colonial policy have provided an additional  reason for the proposed  action.   The question of freedom of access to. Colonial raw materials  is now much in the public mind, and the  removal of this restriction on  the operation of foreign companies in the British Empire will befurther evidence of the willingness of His Majesty&apos;s Government to do what theycan to remove any cause of legitimate complaint in that matterColonial Office, Downing Street,      April 27, 1936.(Initialled)       J.
