HgDOCUMM IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .c A  E T.147  (36!CABINET.THE CORONATION OATHCopy No . . f&apos;/.^     Joint Memorandum by the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.1.   The Government of the Union of South Africa have raised, byan official communication from the High Commissioner to theDominions Office,  the question of the form of Coronation Oath;  acopy of the High Commissioners letter is attached:  (Appendix I).2.   The history of the Oath is, briefly, that It was establishedby an Act of Parliament of 1688 (1 William and Mary, cap.6) in theform in Appendix II.   Prom time to time, in view of constitutional changes such as  the Union with Scotland and with Ireland and theDisestablishment of the Irish Church, the form has been modifiedwithout express  statutory authority, on the view that there isimplied statutory authority to mould the form to suit such changes.The form used at the Coronation of King George &quot;V in 1911 is set outin Appendix III.3.   The question whether any further&apos;modification of the form ofthe Oath is desirable, having regard to recent constitutional developments in  relation to the Dominions, has been for some little time under discussion inter-departmentally.   As a result of that discussion the conclusion was reached that the form of the Oathemployed in 1911 was not wholly in accord with the constitutional position resulting from the Imperial Conference of 1926 and theStatute of Westminster, 1931, and that some modification was desirable .   Consideration was also, given to the question whetheramendment could  be made without express legislation, and on thispoint the advice of the Attorney General was sought.   His opinion
 is attached as  Appendix IV,  and it will he seen that he has advised that it would be in  accordance with precedent that a suitable amendment should he made without express legislation for the purpose,  and that it would therefore be appropriate that the first part of the Oath should be amended so as to substitute the words &quot;peoples  of this United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of Your Dominions,  of Your Possessions beyond the Seas,  and of India,  according to  the respective laws and customs of the  same.&quot; 4.   In substance, therefore, we think that we can accept the view of the Union Government that an  amendment of the language of Coronation Oath is desirable.   The actual proposals set out in the High Commissioners letter give rise to some difficulty.   In the first  place,  the form of Oath proposed by the Union Government differs from the form which  has been  devised here.   It represents a rather greater departure from the existing Oath, and, moreover, the separate  mention of the  Dominions which it involves might give rise to difficulties, both as destroying the balance of the Oath and also with the Irish Pree State in connection with the separatemention of the  Irish Pree State .   Moreover, it does not provide very appropriately for the other Oversea Possessions of the Crown, nor does it mention India.   Prom this point of view, therefore,we greatly prefer the form of Oath prepared here. 5;.   The Union  proposals also indicate that legislation is contemplated  in the Union of South Africa.   It is not clear whether if the  Union Government are assured that we are prepared to make a  change and consider that such a change can be made,  so far as  we  are concerned, without legislation,  they will think itnecessary  to  press for legislation in the Union,  and we should hope that,  in those circumstances, they might  be prepared to drop the idea of legislation.   If,  however,  they still feel that legislation is  desirable,  we do not think that it is necessary to
     For example,  the first clause of the proposed Bill states&quot;The King shall.....take an Oath&quot;;  the wording of the UnitedKingdom Act is  &quot;the  oath..... shall and may be administered&quot;.     The form of the  second clause of the proposed Union Bill&quot;The Governor General may authorise any person....&quot; seems alsoinappropriate. resist this proposal, though it might he well to pbint out to them in some appropriate manner that the form of legislation which they propose is not wholly suitable . 6.   The question of the form of Oath to be taken by the King at his Coronation is obviously a matter on which His Majesty&apos;s personal wishes must be consulted.   While, for various reasons, we think it desirable that,  as the Union Government have raised this matter officially with the other Governments, the preliminary discussions on the question should be continued as between the Governments, it should be made clear that any proposals are, of course, subject to His Majesty&apos;s approval. 7.   It might perhaps be desirable for a written opinion on the matter to be prepared by the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers for His Majesty&apos;s consideration.   Such an opinion could, if thought desirable or necessary, be communicated to the Union Government and to the other Dominion Governments. 8.   We have felt that the Cabinet ought to be aware of the question raised by the Union Government with regard to the Oath before the Coronation Council meets, and the necessary machinery as regards preparations for the Coronation are put in hand. 9 .   At the same time we feel that the Cabinet should be aware that the Union proposals also raise a somewhat wider issue.   It is clearly of the greatest importance that all practicablemeasures should be taken to  associate the Dominions as closely as possible with the Coronation Ceremony.   On the other hand, any
26th May. 1956 .departure from the traditional procedure under whichpreparations for the Coronation are made by a Committee  ofthe Privy Council would be difficult, and, even if it were possible to overcome this difficulty, there is at any rate a risk of resulting embarrassment on constitutional points.We do not desire to make any recommendation on this aspect of the matter at the moment, but the Cabinet may think itdesirable for it to be further explored between the Departmentsconcerned before the Coronation Committee actually begins its work.

South Africa House,     Trafalgar Square, W.C.2,1st May, 1936.Sir,     I have the honour, on the instructions of my.Government,to state that, in anticipation of an invitation being extendedto them to participate in the Ceremony of the Coronation ofHis Majesty King Edward VIII, His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnion have recently given consideration to the form of the coronation Oath, and they desire that I should bring thefollowing observations to the notice of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom.     Since the Coronation Oath was administered to the late king george V, fundamental changes have taken place in the structure of the British Empire, which, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the Union,  render it necessary to reconsider the coronation Ceremony and the Oath administered to the King.     The Coronation is a matter in which all the Members of theBritish Commonwealth are  interested, and the Coronation Oathforms,  as far as His Majesty&apos;s peoples are concerned, a fundamentalpart of the Coronation Ceremony.   The Oath which the King takesto govern according to law reveals the foundation upon which the structure of democratic Government has been reared throughout theCommonwealth.     His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union are, however, ofopinion that the Coronation Ceremony,  in its traditional form, is,in law, as well as in fact,  one which takes account merely of theroalm of the United Kingdom.    It is the only autonomous coKuaiuniiyexpressly mentioned in the Oath;  the Parliament referred to in the oath is the Parliament of the United Kingdom and if the Dominionsare affected at all by it, it would be as &quot;dominions&quot; of theUnited Kingdom, i.e. territories subordinate to that Kingdom.I am to recall that the fully autonomous communities which are now the equals of the community of the United Kingdom can no longer be described as subordinate  parts of the realm of the UnitedKingdom,  and it could not, therefore,  reasonably be expected ofthem,  in the view of His  Majesty&apos;s GOArernment in the Union,  toparticipate in a Ceremony in  which they can take- part only assubordinates to,  and not  as  equals of,  the United Kingdom.     As the Union desires to  be represented at and to participate in the  Coronation Ceremony, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the  Unionare of  the opinion that the  time has arrived to give the CoronationCeremony a form more true to  its present character,  viz. that ofa Ceremony which concerns all the Members of the Commonwealth andnot merely one of them, and  in which all could participate inconformity with their accepted status.Maj e s t y&apos; s Principal Secretary of State      for Dominion Affairs,           Dominions Office,                Downing Street,  S.W.I.
     To give effect to this view, it would, appear to he necessary either for separate Oaths to he administered in respect of each Member of the Commonwealth, or for the Oath to be a collective one.   His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union are of the opinion that the administration of a multiplicity of oaths in different form would detract from the dignity, of the Ceremony, and they would therefore prefer that the matter be so arranged that the Oath be. a collective one.   They accordingly propose,  as being suitable  to the occasion, a form such as that contained in Annexure A, which I am instructed to submit for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.   It is suggested that the second part of the Oath could remain as it is to-day,  while His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union,  in the absence of an established Church in the Union, have no observations to offer in regard to the third part,  which explicitly deals with the English Church in the United Kingdom.     His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the  Union contemplate dealing with the  matter in an Act of Parliament,  a draft of which is set forth in  Annexure B to this despatch.     It will be&quot;observed  that the intention of Section one of the draft Bill is to establish a form of  Oath for the King in respect of the Union.   Section two of the draft  Bill provides for the administration of the Oath by a person appointed by the Governor- General,  and, if agreed upon by Members of the  Commonwealth,  for the  substitution of a collective Oath for that  established under Section one of the Bill.    It is intended that  this person to be appointed by the Governor-General shall be, the  Archbishop appointed to administer the Oath according to English practice , in respect of the United  Kingdom,  should  he be  agreeable.     In submitting these  views to His Majestyhs Government in theUnited Kingdom,  I am further  instructed to ask  whether they would,ty passing similar legislation,  be prepared to  co-operate  inattaining the administration of a collective Oath in the manner setforth  above,  and to request,  in view  of its importance and the limited time available for the enactment  of the necessary legislation that  the  matter be given  the earliest possible  consideration.    His  Majesty&apos;s Government  in the  Union have also communicatedtheir  proposals  in this regard to His  Majesty&apos;s Governments inCanada, the Commonwealth  of Australia,  New Zealand  and the IrishFree State.I have,  etc.  (Sd. ).

The Governor-General may authorise any person to administer the Oath and may arrange with the otherMembers of the British Commonwealth of Nations for a collective Oath to be administered to and to be takenby the King, in a form to be agreed upon, provided thatthe purport of the Oath as set forth in section one be embodied in such collective Oath.

                                                        Ill         -      -     APPENDIX  IV.                    MEMORANDUM         ON THE FORM OP THE CORONATION OATH.         I understand the proposed alterations are as follows,&quot;namely,  to substitute the words  &quot;The peoples of this UnitedKingdom  of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of Your Dominions,of Your  Possessions beyond the Seas, and of India, accordingtS the respective laws and  customs of the same&quot; for the words&quot;The people of this United Kingdom of Great Britain and Irelandand the  Dominions thereto belonging according to the Statutes inParliament agreed on and the respective Laws and Customs of thesame&quot;.         It seems to me that the words proposed to besubstituted accurately describe the constitutional positionas it now is, whereas the words used in 1911 do not.   TheAct of 1927*  provides that the expression &quot;United Kingdom&quot;-shall, unless the context otherwise requires, mean GreatBritain  and Northern Ireland.&quot;  Since the passing of theStatute  of Westminster the words &quot;thereto belonging&quot; inthe 1911 Form appear to me to be inaccurate.  The questionI am asked to consider is whether changes as suggested inthe Form of Oath, which had its origin in the Act of 1 Will.             * i .e . the Royal and Parliamentary                    Titles Act, 1927.Be
 &amp; M. c . 6, can be made without a special statute-  In the past changes have been made without an express amending statute in cases where it was necessary to alter words descriptive of the territories subject to His Majesty in order to make the words accurate, having regard to Acts of Parliament passed since the date of the original Act, in particular the Acts of Union with Scotland and Ireland.It is true that there was an express reference in theAct of 1707 to an alteration with regard to the words which referred to the Protestant form of religion.  Thefact that it was not thought necessary expressly toamend the First Question I think increases the value ofthis precedent as a constitutional authority for makingthe present proposed changes without a special Act.Further, changes were made as the result of the Act of union with Ireland, although there was no express mentionin that Act of the Coronation Oath.   The precedent of the alteration consequent on the Irish Churches EstablishmentAct is one to which I attach less importance as reliancecould in that instance be placed on Section 69 of theDisestablishment Act.  On the whole my opinion is thatthe alteration can properly be made without special legislation.  I think the precedents establish that an alteration in the Coronation Oath in the description ofthe territories under His Majesty,  necessary in orderaccurately to describe those territories having regardto their extent or their relation to each other,  does not require special legislation.
