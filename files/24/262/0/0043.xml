Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.   43CP.  153 (36).CABINET.                            CATTLE  SUBSIDY.          Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.     THE Secretary of State for  Scotland and I have carefully considered theconclusions  of  the  Cattle  Subsidy Committee  presided  over  by  the Lord.Chancellor (CP. 152 (36)).  We desire to express our sincere appreciation of theexpeditious and careful attention which the Committee have given to this difficult problem.  We think that, if the Cabinet see fit to endorse their recommendations,a scheme for the maintenance and  improvement of the United Kingdom livestockindustry can be prepared which should secure the support of a wide  range of reasonable opinion.     2.  We are in full agreement with  the Committee as to the desirability of adjusting the subsidy so as to encourage the production of high quality beef, andas to the inclusion in the long-term scheme of  provision for efficiency measures,the cost of such measures being met out of the subsidy fund.     3.  Preliminary consideration has already been given by the agricultural departments to proposals of this  nature, but further  detailed examination and consultation with outside interests will be necessary before long-term legislationcan be finally brought forward.  Moreover, we  are informed by the  Chief Whipthat there is  no time available before Parliament rises for the summer recess forthe full consideration  which both Houses would wish to give to  a Bill  of thisimportance.     4.  Provision is made under existing legislation (Cattle Industry (emergency provisions) Acts, 1934 and 1935) for the continuance of the subsidy of 5s. per livehundredweight until the 30th June,  1936. By an Affirmative Resolution of each house of  Parliament this period  can be extended until  the 31st October, 1936.It will clearly,  however, be impossible to have the long-term legislation on  theStatute Book by that date, and we propose, therefore, that  a short  Bill should beintroduced and passed before the  summer recess  extending the existing subsidyarrangements, without modification, for such period as may be necessary to bridge the gap between the 31st October and the date when the long-term  scheme can beexpected to come into operation.  Further consultation will be held with the chief whip as to when this Bill and the Affirmative Resolution should be introduced.    5.  We should hope that it would be possible to arrange both for the collectionof the proposed customs duty on foreign beef and the payments out under the newsubsidy scheme to begin not later than the 1st January, 1937, but there can be no assurance at this stage that this time-table will be secured, and it is most important that the extension we now propose should be amply sufficient to avoid any risk of afurther interim measure being necessary.  The best course would appear to be toprovide for  an extension until such time as  the  long-term proposals come intooperation or until, say, the 31st July,  1937, whichever is the earlier date.    6.  It will be necessary, when this extending Bill is introduced, if not before,.to make an announcement in general terms of the Governments intentions withregard to long-term  legislation.   Both  the  terms and the  date  of the  public       [13330]A
announcement will need to be very carefully considered in relation to the progressof the negotiations with the Argentine Government and the Dominions.   Weshould propose to consult with our colleagues on the Trade and agricultural committee on these matters.    7.  To sum up--     (i) We consider that a satisfactory scheme for the maintenance and improve-           ment of the United Kingdom Livestock Industry  can be prepared on           the lines recommended by the Cattle Subsidy Committee of the Cabinet.    (ii) If these recommendations are approved by the  Cabinet, we ask for           authority to  prepare a short interim measure  to provide for an           extension of the existing subsidy arrangements, without modification,           from the 31st October next until such time as  the long-term proposals           can be brought into operation, or until, say, the 31st July, 1937, which-           ever is the earlier date.                                                                 W. E. E.Ministry of A griculture and Fisheries,           June 9,1936.
