The  substance of  the  report is summarised by the      Committee in  a series of Conclusions stated in paragraphs      471-485 on pagesi of the printed proof9  ox  which a copy is annexeo      to this memorandum&apos;.               As a result  ol their review of the present  &quot;complex and      chaotic structure  of  distribution&apos;&quot;  (paragraph 52) 9  the Committee      say that  there can be no question &quot;that an improvement in the      present organisation  can and  must be effected,,    In practically      every case the Associations and witnesses who have  appeared      before us have stated that the present  organisation is      unsatisfactory and calls for  improvement&quot;  (paragraphs 84-85).               I need  not at this stage enter into a description of the      Committee!s recommendations or discuss  their merits.    The most      important features are the general  scheme  of reorganisation of      distribution  which they recommend (paragraph 471),  and their      proposals for dealing with holding  companies (-paragraph 475).      Any scheme for dealing effectively  with the present unsatisfactory      position is hound  to  evoke opposition from some  quarter9 end the      proposals of  the Committee? particularly  those  which  may involve      the transfer  of  a  substantial number of  the  smaller local      authority undertakings from public  to company ownerships, will      need  close examination.   It  appears to me that  the Conclusions      which Sir Harry McGowan and his two colleagues9  Sir John Snell      (Chairman of  the Electricity  Commissioners)  and  Mr. John Mori son      (Chartered Accountant) have reached could  advantageously be      examined  by a  Cabinet  Committee.    Meanwhile9  it  is necessary  to

Moreover, the publication of thereport would in itself be useful as a means of ascertaining there actions of the interests directly affected, and in this waymight assist the deliberations of the Cabinet Committee.

Committee  on  Electricity  DistributionREPORT To THE RIGHT  HONOURABLE  LESLIE HORE-BELISHA,  M.P.,                     Minister of Transport  SIR,                  TERMS OF REFERENCE  1. We were appointed in July, 1935, with the following Terms ofReference :       &apos;&apos; To bring under review the organisation of the distribution of    electricity in Great  Britain, including the control of statutory    electricity companies by other companies, to advise on methods    by which improvements can be effected with a view to ensuring    and expediting the  standardisation  of systems, pressures  and    methods of charge, further extending facilities (including supplies    in rural areas) and  reducing costs, and to make recommenda-    tions.&quot;                      INTRODUCTORY  2. The organisation for the supply of electricity in  Great britain has previously been reviewed by a number of Committees, includingthe Electric Power Supply Committee in  1918, and the Weir Com-mittee  in 1925.  While their  investigations  did not  altogetherexclude some consideration of the distribution  of electricity, their efforts  and recommendations were mainly directed  to the steps which could be taken to put what may be termed the wholesale  sideof  electricity supply,  that is to say, generation and transmission in bulk, on the most economic and efficient basis.  This point of view is reflected in the Electricity (Supply) Acts of 1919, 1922, and 1926,which were the outcome of the recommendations of those Committees.  3. The reorganisation of generation was an essential preliminary toany detailed investigation of  the  organisation of distribution,  andthis has been effected by the establishment of the Central electricity board to control generation on a national basis.
   4. The generation of electricity is now being concentrated in fewer and more efficient stations, and the creation of the Grid System has made available to the large majority of  Supply Authorities supplies in bulk at the lowest cost, sufficient for their present and future requirements.   Such Authorities  are, therefore,  in a  position  to concentrate their energies  on the more  efficient and widespread distribution and sale of electricity to their consumers.   5. The  problems  arising  in connection  with  distribution are entirely different in character from, and far more complex than, those arising in  connection with  generation.  In the  latter  case, the problems are almost wholly of a technical character, involving con- sideration of known and comparable factors, and there is no difficulty in reducing relative efficiencies to one common measure.   6. In the case of distribution, while technical considerations still play an important part, commercial enterprise,  including  salesman- ship, is, in our opinion,  an even more  important factor, and the keynote on which  its  success depends.  Effective salesmanship involves the closest relationship between the Supply Authority and the  persons it is  serving or authorised  to serve.   When  regard  is had to the number of variable factors which have  to be taken into account, such as the extent and general characteristics of the area  of supply, the density and location of population, the various types  of dwellings in different parts of the area,  and  the existence or non- existence  of different classes of industrial load, it will at once be apparent that it is a matter of great difficulty  to  find an effectivestandard by which the relative efficiency of  different  distribution undertakings can be compared.  7. We have considered it essential in  the circumstances to take evidence on&apos; as wide a  basis  as practicable.   In  addition to the Electricity Commissioners and  the Associations directly  representing bodies actually engaged  in the  distribution of electricity  (Joint Authorities and Joint Boards, Municipalities and  Companies), wehave heard and received  evidence from the manufacturing, con- tracting and employees sections of the Industry ; from organisationsrepresenting local authorities,  consumers and ratepayers,  including representatives of commerce and industry ;  from  agricultural and rural development interests ;  and from  various witnesses specially concerned with and having great experience in  different aspects of the Industry.  8. Schedules of the personal appearances and of the bodies and persons by whom  written statements of evidence were submitted tous are contained in Parts (1) and (2) respectively of Appendix I tothis Report.  9. The statistics which  are  embodied  in Appendix II  form themain basis of subsequent statistical references in this Report, andwere compiled by the Electricity  Commissioners from  the returnsrendered to them  by the Supply Authorities.
             SURVEY OF  PAST  LEGISLATION  10. Before commenting in detail on the complicated organisation for  the distribution of electricity as it exists today, we consider itdesirable to draw attention to the principal  circumstances whichhave led up to the present position.   In the  following paragraphsreference is made  as briefly  as possible to  the various Acts  ofParliament which have been  passed  from time  to time, and themajority of which still govern electricity supply today ; what appearsto have been the intention underlying such enactments ;  and what,in fact, their effect has been.  11. Legislation relating to electricity supply commenced with the electric Lighting Act  of 1882.  That Act empowered the Board ofTrade to grant a licence or Provisional Order to any Local Authority,Company, or person,  authorising them to supply  electricity for any public or private purposes within any area.  It  would seem, however,that it was the underlying intention of the Act that the  supply ofelectricity should be regarded as a public service, and that if a LocalAuthority did not itself obtain the  rights of supply for its  owndistrict in the first instance, it should have the  right to take over thesupply on defined terms at the end of a comparatively short period,i.e., 21 years.   In other words, it was definitely contemplated  thateventually each local authority should, if it so desired, be the supplyauthority for its own  district.  12. Technical conditions at the time no doubt lent support to thispolicy.   The principal operating system of supply was direct current,and its effective radius of distribution would not in most cases extend beyond the limits of any one local authority district.  This technicalrestriction was still further emphasised by the practice of the Board ofTrade of inserting or  incorporating,  in all Provisional  Orders,  aprovision prohibiting one  statutory  undertaker  from associatingitself with another.  13. The outcome of the  Act of 1882 was  the establishment  insucceeding  years  of  a  large  number  of  undertakings,  generallyrestricted in  area  to  that of  an individual local  authority district.Such  districts  were,  with  a few  exceptions,  densely populatedBoroughs and Urban  Districts, leaving the more sparsely populatedrural  areas  almost entirely unprovided for.   These undertakingslimited  to one local authority district,  still form a  preponderatingpart of  the  structure  of  electricity  distribution to-day, and theparochial point of view which the policy of early legislation tended tocreate, still persists and is, in our opinion, one of the major difficulties to be overcome in any reorganisation of distribution.  14. In the earlier years, the use of electricity was confined almostentirely to lighting purposes, and its development on a commercial basis was a highly speculative risk.  Even with the security of therates behind them, local authorities were only prepared to take out
Orders in the more densely populated areas.  The Companies, facedwith the possibility  of  compulsory purchase at the end of a com-paratively  short period, found difficulty in  raising capital for theestablishment of such undertakings, even in urban areas.  15. This difficulty was recognised by the passing of a furtherElectric  Lighting  Act  in 1888,  which  substituted a  franchise of42 years for the franchise of 21 years provided for in the Act of 1882,and slightly modified the procedure in the event of purchase.  16. At the same time the Act of 1888 established a principle which,in the light of subsequent  experience, can  only  be  regarded as aretrograde  step, namely, that the granting of powers to any under-takers to supply electricity within any area should not in any wayhinder or restrict  the granting of competitive powers to the  localauthority or to any other company or person within the same area.  17. It  is understood that one of the factors that gave rise to thisprovision was the development of  alternating current as an alter-native system of supply to  direct current.  The provision was,  forinstance, applied in the  London area in granting duplicate powers toa Supply Authority which proposed to suppky alternating current inan area where another authority was already supplying direct current.  18. While the duplication  of powers  which has arisen under thisSection may not be very substantial, it has added to the complexities of the existing distribution organisation.  19. Up to the end of 1900, 639 Provisional Orders had been granted by the Board of Trade and  confirmed by Parliament, but of these119 had already been  repealed  or  revoked, while two confirmedOrders did not come into operation.  Of the 518 Orders in force atthe end of  1900, 354  were granted to or held by local authorities and164 were granted to or held by companies.  20. As indicated above, the use of electricity in the earlier years was almost entirely limited to lighting purposes.  With subsequentadvances in technical practice, in particular the development of thethree-phase alternating current system and of the electric motor for industrial  purposes,  it  began  to be realised  that electricity  wascapable of  more widespread application, and that the basis on whichpowers had been granted and undertakings had been established didnot enable the fullest  advantage to be taken of the possibilitiesattaching to the generation of electricity at high voltage, and to itstransmission over far larger areas than an individual local authoritydistrict.  21. In 1898 this aspect of  electricity  supply  was reported on bya Joint Select Committee of the  House  of Lords and the House ofCommons,  presided  over by Viscount  Cross,  and the  conclusions which they reached mark an important stage in the development ofelectricity supply.
  22. The Cross Committee expressed the view that the conditions imposed by the Electric Lighting Acts of 1882 and 1888 were not appropriate where a supply was proposed to be given in bulk at high voltages over large areas, and that, whereas the powers of purchase conferred on local authorities by  those Acts were intended to relate to distribution schemes  for lighting  only in individual areas, the application of electrical  energy in the form of power, for a wide variety of purposes, was likely in the future  to  be an important feature.  23. That Committee accordingly reported in favour of powers being granted to Companies over large areas covering the districts of a number of local authorities,  and  recommended that the under- takings so established should not be subject to the  ordinary rights of purchase by the local authorities.   It was, however, suggested that such  powers  should be  subject  to certain  restrictions which,  as subsequent events have shown, largely frustrated the objects sought to be achieved.  24. In 1900 a number of Power Company Bills were  introduced and  were considered by  a House of Commons Committee  presided over by Sir James Kitson.  Notwithstanding strong opposition from many of the local  authorities concerned, the Committee reported in favour of the  Bills with the  comment  that the value of electrical energy as applied to power purposes had been amply demonstrated ; that its importance to  the industries in this country was admitted ; and that it was to  the public advantage to facilitate measures which would ensure a general supply of electrical energy to all consumers who might seek to avail themselves of the economy and efficiency offered by the application of such a supply.  25. The Bills as  eventually enacted by Parliament gave the Power Companies incorporated  thereby  powers of supply over  extensive areas;  provided that the rights of purchase  conferred on  local authorities by the  Electric Lighting Act of  1888 should not  apply to the undertakings established  under such Acts ;  and, as  a measure of protection for  the  consumers, included provision for a sliding scale of price and dividend.  (As  indicated later on in our Report - see paragraph 172 this provision never became  effective in practice.)The rights of supply under such Acts were at the  same time restricted by the insertion of a clause drafted by the Committee and known as the Kitson Clause.  26. This Clause provided       (a) that the powers of the  Company should be limited  to    supplies of electricity in bulk to  authorised  distributors ;  for    providing power to any persons ;  and for lighting any premises    where a power supply was utilised ;      (b) that the  Company should  not  supply electricity in any    area which at the  passing of the Special Act formed part of the
   22. The Cross Committee expressed the view that  the conditions imposed by the Electric Lighting Acts of 1882 and  1888 were not appropriate where a supply was proposed to be given in bulk at high voltages over large areas, and that, whereas the powers of purchase conferred on local authorities by those Acts were intended to  relate to distribution schemes for lighting  only in individual areas, the application of electrical energy in the form  of power, for a wide variety of purposes, was likely in the future to  be an important feature.   -   23. That Committee accordingly reported in favour of powers being granted to Companies over  large areas covering the districts of a number of local authorities, and  recommended that the under- takings so established should not be subject to the  ordinary rights of purchase by the local authorities.   It was, however, suggested that such  powers should be subject  to certain restrictions which,  as subsequent events have shown, largely frustrated the  objects sought to be achieved.  24. In  1900 a number of Power Company  Bills were  introduced and  were considered by a House  of Commons Committee presided over by Sir James Kitson.  Notwithstanding strong opposition from many of the local  authorities concerned, the Committee reported in favour of the  Bills with the comment  that the value of electrical energy as applied to power purposes had been  amply demonstrated ; that its importance to  the industries in this country was admitted ; and that it was to  the public advantage to facilitate measures  which would ensure a general supply of  electrical energy to all consumers who might seek to avail themselves of the economy  and efficiency offered by the application of such a supply.  25.

(As indicated later on in our Report see paragraph 172 this provision never became effective in practice.)The rights of supply under such Acts were at the same time restricted by the insertion of a clause drafted by the Committee and knownas the Kitson  Clause.  26. This Clause provided       (a) that the powers of the  Company  should  be limited to    supplies of electricity in bulk to  authorised  distributors ;  for    providing power to any persons ;  and for lighting any premises    where a power supply was utilised ;      [b) that the Company should  not  supply electricity in any    area which at  the  passing of the Special Act formed part of the
     area of supply of any authorised distributors except with the     consent of such distributors, such consent not to be unreasonably     withheld ;  and       (c) that if at any time after the passing of the Act, any local     authority, company, or person became authorised distributors,     provision might be made by the Act or Provisional Order under     which the distributors became authorised, as to the taking over     of any supply then given by the Company for use exclusively     within the area of supply of the distributors or otherwise as to     the  powers of the Power Company to supply within that area.  This  Clause,  with variations, was incorporated in  most  of thesimilar Special Acts granted in subsequent years.  27. It was the practice to exclude entirely from the areas  of thePower Companies,  the  areas of  supply of certain of  the  largermunicipal distributing authorities, and in certain other cases to give such distributing authorities, although within the areas of the  PowerCompanies, an absolute veto of consent.  28. The establishment of Power Companies by Acts passed in 1900and subsequent years was of great  importance as representing  a departure from the hitherto  accepted principle that all  electricity undertakings, where not already  owned by  the  local authorities,should be subject to  purchase by such authorities.  29. Progress made by the Power Companies up to the end of 1918was,  however,  slow.  The  Companies  experienced  difficulty  in raising capital except at  high rates of interest, this being partly dueto the new and untried  phase of  electrical development  for  whichthe capital  was required, and partly due to the restrictions  whichhad been imposed on the Power Companies by their Special Acts.  30. Subsequent experience has  shown that  it was a mistake to envisage successful development of large areas if such developmentwas to be divorced from the urban centres of population in such areas.The idea of establishing undertakings having powers of supply overcomprehensive areas was sound in principle and represented a greatadvance  over previous conceptions, but it failed substantially in its object, partly because of the restrictions which were imposed on thePower Companies, and partly because there was no obligation uponthe various distribution authorities to take supplies in bulk from thePower Companies.   The result was that in the majority of cases suchauthorities  instead  of  becoming   bulk  consumers of the PowerCompanies, as  had been  anticipated,  preferred  to continue  theoperation of their small independent generating stations.  31. In 1908 (for London) and in  1909 (for the country as a whole),further Acts were passed which removed certain of the restrictionsprohibiting  association between statutory undertakers and allowedthem to  enter into mutual agreements for the giving and taking of
supplies of electricity  in bulk.  The further  powers conferred bythese Acts were, however, permissive only and do not appear to havebeen used to any wide extent.  32. The Act of  1909 also  made  provision for the setting up of joint Boards of two or more local authorities for the joint exerciseof powers in their areas.  The extent to which such powers have been exercised is indicated by the fact that today only five Joint Boardsare in existence, four of which were set up under the Act of 1909.  33. During the Great War  (1914 to 1918) there was an enormousexpansion in the use of electricity for industrial purposes, especiallyin connection with the manufacture of  munitions, and the weakness of the then structure of the industry became apparent.  34. Between 1916 and 1918 the supply of electricity was reviewed by three Committees, namely : -      (a) The Electrical Trades Committee, which was appointed to    consider the future position of the Electrical Trades generally    after the war ;      (b) The Ministry of Reconstruction  Coal Conservation Com-    mittee, whose  terms of  reference required them to consider,    inter alia, what improvements could be effected in the  methods    of using coal for the production of power, light and  heat ;  and      (c) The Electric  Power Supply Committee, which investigated    in detail the proposals outlined by the two previous Committees    in so far as they related to electricity supply, and was  required    to report what  steps should be taken by legislation or otherwise    to ensure that  there should be an adequate and  economical    supply of electrical energy  to  all  classes of  consumers in the    United Kingdom.  35. The  Electrical  Trades Committee  and  a  Sub-Committeeappointed by the Coal  Conservation Committee each  drew attentionto the chaotic conditions which existed in regard to  the  generationand  distribution of electricity,  the responsibility for which  theyattributed mainly to restrictive legislation in the past ;  to  the lackof foresight in granting powers of supply ;  and to the absence of a central controlling body for securing that the technical developmentof the industry should proceed on a properly co-ordinated basis.  Theneed for a change in the national policy and for the establishment ofsuch a central controlling body, free from political control and with adequate powers to deal with the  situation, was one of the main recommendations  of both Committees.  36. The Sub-Committee in  their Report emphasised the necessityfor the reorganisation  of generation on a more efficient  basis, and recommended that it was essential that the inefficient system com-prising some 600 undertakings ,each of which owned its own generating station,  should be  superseded by a comprehensive  system under
which  the country should  be divided into a  limited number  ofdistricts, in each of which there should be one authority dealing withall the generation and main transmission.  37. The Sub-Committee also dealt at length with the reasons whythe Power Companies, which had been established with the primary object  of dealing with the generation and supply of power on a large scale, had not been effective in developing power supplies on  soundlines.  The Sub-Committee  reached the conclusion that the failureof the Power Companies could be attributed to the fact that  thePower Act legislation had  been faulty in certain respects.   In  thewords  of their Report, &quot; Parliament was apparently convinced thatthe generation and supply of electricity must be dealt with in a bigway, though  how important this would become they perhaps hardlyforesaw.   They were, however, apparently afraid to  insist on  the amalgamation of the existing lighting enterprises which, as has been shown, were and are still each limited to a few miles of area instead ofcovering  as  they  should a  few counties.  Parliament,  therefore,devised the existing form of Power Acts which is complicated andunworkable.&quot;  38. The Electric Power Supply Committee  in  their Report dealtin detail  with the history of the electricity supply industry up tothat date, and reached the conclusion that the system under which a supply of electricity was being provided in a large number of smallareas by separate authorities was the result of a policy adopted at atime when the applied  science of electrical engineering was  in itsinfancy and  was incompatible with anything  which could (at  thetime of their  Report) be accepted as a technically sound system, andthat a comprehensive system for the generation of  electricity and,where  necessary,  for reorganising its supply should be  established as soon as possible.  39. That Committee referred to the failure of Power Act legislation which, though more consistent with the development of the applica-tion of electrical power to  industry, had not, for reasons indicatedin the previous paragraphs in this Report, been effectual in providing a comprehensive system of supply.  40. They  expressed the  view that legislation had hitherto been influenced by an insufficiently large and comprehensive outlook,and emphasised that municipal or local government  areas are  notnecessarily, and,  in  fact,  are rarely  the most economical areas of electrical supply, and that the parochial system of generation anddistribution should give place to more economical methods, involvingwider areas of distribution and the combination of diverse kinds ofindustry in order to obtain the fullest use of larger generating plant.  41. They recognised that there were instances in the country of low costs in small areas where the load was concentrated, but indicated that the object to be kept in view was not merely to have exception-ally low costs in a few small and specially favoured spots,  but  rather
11193to have the same or lower costs available over wide industrial areas.They also emphasised the necessity for a comprehensive view beingtaken,  as opposed to previous tendencies to consider local conditionsrather  than  the national interests.  42. With  a view to achieving  these objects,  the Electric PowerSupply Committee recommended that one central authority shouldbe  established  to  regulate  the  generation and distribution ofelectricity ;  that the generation of electricity should be reorganisedby the creation of Electricity District Boards, to which generating stations and main transmission lines should be transferred ;  andthat the purchase rights of  the Local Authorities in the various districts should be transferred to the Boards, who should also beempowered to  acquire any undertakings by agreement.  43. The Bill giving effect to the Committee&apos;s proposals as origin-ally  drafted, provided for the  compulsory  transfer  of generating stations and main transmission lines to District Authorities, and forthe  establishment of the  Electricity Commissioners  to carry theproposals into effect.  It is also of interest to note that during theprogress of the Bill a provision was inserted that, where a generating station of  a Power Company was transferred  compulsorily  to a district Authority, the Power Company  could elect to have  their whole undertaking taken over.  44. At a  late  stage the Bill  was emasculated by the  exclusion of the proposed compulsory powers and the Electricity (Supply)Act, 1919, as finally  enacted, left it to the Electricity commissioners to co-ordinate  generation and transmission under  the new DistrictAuthorities  on a voluntary basis.  45. Under the Act of 1919, as amended by the Act of 1922, fourJoint Electricity Authorities  and  certain Boards  (the  latter withadvisory powers only) were established, but owing to the absenceof compulsory powers the reorganisation of generation and maintransmission on a comprehensive basis proved to be impracticable.The outcome of the Act  of  1919,  so far as  the  co-ordination ofgeneration was concerned,  is aptly summarised  in  the  following extract from the Report of  the  subsequent Weir  Committee :        &quot; Five years of patient and capable effort have been unavail-     ing.  Co-ordination  has not  been  achieved.  The  advisory     bodies created under the Act have agreed on technical schemes,     but local interests have prevented  the carrying out of those     schemes.   Delay and procrastination are  widespread,  and the     policy of suasion can only be written down as  a failure.&quot;   46. While, however, the Act  of  1919  failed to bring about anadequate reorganisation of generation it established in the ElectricityCommissioners an  expert body  who, within the limited  powers conferred on  them, have, as many witnesses have  informed  us,
undoubtedly exercised considerable influence on the more progressivegrowth of the industry in recent  years.  47. The  reorganisation  of generation  and  transmission  on  a voluntary basis having proved to be impracticable, the Governmentin January, 1925, appointed a Committee under  the  chairmanship of Lord Weir to review  the  national problem  of  the supply of electrical energy,  and to present a Report on the  broad lines ofpolicy which  should be adopted to ensure its most  efficient  and effective development.  48.  The  Weir Committee  adopted as their  central objective thereduction in price and the greatest availability of electrical energyto the consumer.  In this connection they recognised that it was of primary importance that the generation and transmission of electricity-should be so  organised that ample supplies of electricity should beavailable in bulk  to the various Distributing Authorities at the lowest possible cost.  49.  The  Weir Committee recommended the establishment of theCentral Electricity Board, whose main  functions were to be :        (a) to  control and  co-ordinate  the generation  of electricity     in the most efficient selected stations ;       (b) to interconnect  such stations with one another and with     the systems of authorised distributors  by the construction  of     the Grid ; and       (c) to standardise frequency in so far as it was necessary for     the carrying out of the Grid schemes. These recommendations,     as embodied in the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1926, are now being     successfully carried out by  the Central Electricity Board.   50.  As regards  the  distribution of  electricity,   the principal recommendations of the  Weir Committee  related to  the type  of distribution authority which, it  was  suggested,  should be set up in  areas which at  that  time had  not been developed.  For  such undeveloped  areas the Weir Committee recommended that powers of supply should be granted in respect of wide areas to a new  type of Company which would embody the more desirable principles of both  Power  and  Distribution  Companies ;  that such Companies should be given a longer tenure (50 years)  than that provided for in the Act of  1888 ; that the undertakings so established should only be purchasable as a whole by a Joint Electricity Authority or an Association of Local Authorities in the area ;  and that the terms of purchase should be capital expenditure less depreciation, instead of those laid down by the Act of 1888.   51. In view  of the extent to which  the  country  was already covered by electricity powers this provision, embodied in Section 39 of the  Act of  1926,  has  necessarily  only been  capable of limited
                               13                             19application, but we are informed that some 20 undertakings of thekind envisaged by the Weir Committee have been established.  52. With regard to  existing distribution undertakings, the WeirCommittee recommended certain minor modifications which were intended to have a  palliative effect, but  they left untouched  the complex and chaotic structure of distribution which it has been our task to bring under review.              REVIEW OF  PRESENT  POSITION  53. According to evidence which has been placed before us, therewere, at the 31st March, 1934, no less than 635 separate authorisedundertakers,  comprising, in  addition  to the  Central electricity board,  3 Joint Electricity  Authorities, 5  Joint Boards, 373 LocalAuthorities,  and 253  Companies and persons.  A  fourth  joint electricity Authority (North Wales and South Cheshire) was estab-lished, but transferred its executive  powers of supply to the north wales  Power Company, Limited.  54. Of the total of 635 undertakers, the  Central Electricity Boardand  627 other undertakers were actually supplying  electricity at31st March, 1934.  55. Counting  contiguous  undertakings  of  the  same undertakeras  constituting one  combined  undertaking,  but  geographicallyseparated undertakings as distinct undertakings, the 627 undertakerswere operating 643 undertakings. These vary in size from an under-taking having an area of supply of a few hundred  acres and onlyselling a few thousand units  per annum to an  undertaking having an area of 5,000 square miles and selling upwards of 500 million unitsper annum.  56.  The present admitted lack of uniformity in systems of supplyand voltages, tariffs and methods of charge, facilities for hire orhire-purchase  of  apparatus, assisted wiring, etc., is  undoubtedlydue primarily to the existence of such a  large number of separateundertakings.  57.  With regard  to  systems and  voltages, of 642  undertakingsfor  which  particulars  are   available, alternating  current  alone isbeing supplied in 282  cases ; both  alternating current and directcurrent in 283 cases ; and direct current alone in 77 cases.  In  thecase  of distribution  voltages,  there  are  as  many as  43  differentdeclared voltages for low  and  medium pressure supplies  rangingbetween 100 and 480 volts.  58.  The  multiplicity of  undertakings   involves multiplicity  ofboundaries.   The existence  of different tariffs, different systems ofsupply and different facilities on opposite sides of these numerous
boundaries (in many cases on opposite sides  of the same street) isthe main reason which has led to  a public demand  for  greateruniformity.  59. No practical scheme of reorganisation can eliminate boundariesentirely or result in complete uniformity, but the present positionis such that effective action can and should be taken to bring abouta substantial improvement in this direction.  60. The  position  is  further  complicated  by  the  existence ofduplicate or  competitive powers of supply in many areas and bythe fact  that in areas in which  the local authority is not itself thedistributing authority each individual local  authority has, in themajority of cases, the right to purchase so much of the distributionundertaking as is within its district, at recurring periods.  61. With regard to duplicate or competitive powers, as previouslyindicated, those conferred on Power Companies in perpetuity under special Acts were normally limited to supplies in bulk and for powerpurposes, such  Companies only being authorised to  supply forlighting purposes to  any premises where a power supply was given.  62. The Power Companies were therefore precluded from meetingany general demands for lighting and other domestic purposes suchas cooking and heating.   In most cases,  however, they  obtainedProvisional or Special Orders, either directly or through a subsidiaryor an associated company, giving them full  distribution powers ofsupply for all  purposes in those parts of their  Power Act ares which were not within the area of  supply  of  another distributor.  63. The provisions of the General Acts as to purchase  by theLocal Authorities  apply to such distribution orders.   The  extra-ordinary position  exists  therefore that  over  large  areas  PowerCompanies are operating under duplicate powers, the undertakingsestablished under the Power Act not being subject to purchase incontradistinction to  the undertakings under the Distribution orders which  are.   It  is obvious that a still more undesirable  positionwould be created if  the rights of purchase were exercised in respectof such  distribution orders since the Power Companies would beleft with their Power Act undertaking only and their comprehensiveundertakings would be sub-divided  into  a  number of small  and relatively uneconomic units.  64. Another form of duplicate powers exists in those parts  of a power Company&apos;s area where  another authority holds distributionpowers of  supply.   In  most cases such authorities possess a vetolimited in certain cases and absolute in others, upon supplies being given by the Power  Companies in such areas.  As a result, however,of such duplication of powers, cases have been brought to our noticewhere a Power Company are  supplying  all the important  powerconsumers in a particular area, while the other authority are onlysupplying the lighting and domestic  consumers.
  65. Both  the Power Company  and the  other authority  havethereby lost  the benefit of the diversity  of  load which  could beobtained if all the supplies in such area were in the hands of onlyone authority, with a resultant increase in  the costs of both bodies.  66. We are informed that there are in all 27 Power Companies inGreat Britain. Of this number, some of the  more recently establishedCompanies possess  powers under  their Special Acts which  differsomewhat in character from  the powers conferred by  Power Actlegislation prior to  the War.   Some Companies are, for  instance,authorised by their Act to supply electricity  for all  purposes in areas which are not  within the area of supply of another DistributionAuthority.  In certain of these cases the Acts provide for the pur-chase of the undertaking established thereunder by a Public Authorityat the end of a period of 50 years.   In certain other cases where theActs have authorised, inter alia, the establishment of hydro-electricworks, there is provision for the eventual purchase by the  Board ofTrade  of  such works (as  distinct from  any supply undertakingauthorised by the Act).  67. The important position which Power Companies occupy inthe present organisation of distribution in Great Britain is indicated by the  following figures for the year  ended 31st December,   1934,relating to 18 of the 27 Power Companies,  which by virtue of their special Acts possess certain rights  of supply in perpetuity and have established undertakings which are not under present conditionssubject  to purchase by the Local Authorities concerned :       (i) Total area of supply 36,150  square miles or 41  per cent.    of the total area of Great Britain.      (ii)  Total population of areas of supply 19-6  millions or    43-7 per cent,  of the  total population of Great Britain (on the    basis  of the 1931 Census).      (iii) Capital expenditure  79 millions or 17-5 per cent, of    the total capital expenditure  of  all undertakers.  Of this    expenditure,  some   54 millions was  in respect of the  non-    purchasable undertakings.      (iv) Units sold-        (a)  to consumers for all purposes (excluding bulk supplies),      2,446-5 millions or 18-8 per cent, of the total units sold to      consumers by all undertakers ;        (b)  to other undertakers (excluding the Central Electricity      Board), 963 millions.  68. It should be pointed out:       (a)  that  the  figures of area of supply and population are    inclusive of the areas of  other distribution authorities within    the Power Act areas, the majority  of  which,  as  previously
     indicated, are entitled to exercise some form of veto in  regard     to the provision of supplies by the Power Companies  in such     areas ;       (b) that the figures of capital expenditure and units sold  are     inclusive of the capital expenditure  and units sold of subsidiary     or associated companies, holding  distribution  powers  in  the     Power Act areas.   69.  With  regard  to purchase  rights, in the case of  Companyundertakings (other than those in respect of which Power companies have perpetual rights under their Special Acts) and  in the case ofLocal  Authority  undertakings  (in  so  far as  such undertakingsextend outside the district  of the  local authority possessing  thepowers), the undertakings are in a large majority  of cases subjectto purchase by the individual local authorities concerned at the endof a franchise of 42 years and at recurring periods of 10 years there-after on the terms laid down by Section 2 of  the Electric LightingAct, 1888.  Special rights of  purchase exercisable on special terms and at shorter periods also apply in many  cases.   70.  If the existing rights  of purchase  were all exercised it wouldinvolve the disintegration of the existing undertakings into a larger number of still smaller units and  the existing confusion would be intensified.   71. We are informed that  if all the rights of purchase which falldue during the next ten years were to be exercised, in place of the100 undertakings  alone to which  the purchase rights in  questionapply, there would be substituted no less than 344  undertakings.   72. In a limited  number of cases to which the  provisions  ofSection 39 of the Electricity (Supply) Act,  1926,  apply, the companies have a tenure of 50 years and the undertakings are only purchasableas a whole  on the  terms laid  down by that  Section.  73. It will also  be appropriate at this  stage to refer to  the effectof the numerous alterations of Local Government boundaries underthe County Review Orders confirmed by the Minister of Health inaccordance with the Local Government Act, 1929.  It would appearthat while in a few cases the Orders provide for an adjustment  ofelectricity  areas  to correspond with adjusted Local Governmentboundaries, it is the general practice for such Orders to provide that nothing therein shall alter any electricity areas of supply.  74. These modifications of Local Government boundaries withoutcorresponding modifications  of electricity  boundaries give rise to two main  points  of difficulty  from  an electrical  point of view,namety :   75.  (1)  In many  cases the boundary of  the Local  authority which  is the authorised distributor for its own district, is extendedto include within the district certain neighbouring areas, the added
areas, however,  remaining within the electricity  area  of suppljf Hanother authority.  If the electricity powers are not adjusted therewould be two, or in some cases more, different Supply Authoritiesdistributing electricity in the same Local Government district.  76.  It can be  appreciated that in such cases the Local authority would desire to become the authorised distributor within the wholeof its district.   Furthermore,  the  fact  that  different  supply authorities  are  operating in  one district,  probably with  different rates of charge and  systems of supply and offering different facilities is bound to give rise to complaints by consumers in the less favouredpart of the district.  77.  On the other hand,  such added areas are frequently a develop-ing suburban fringe of the central area with a substantial potentialdemand for  electricity.   In many cases, therefore,  this  fringerepresents one of the more remunerative  portions of the area  ofsupply of the outside authority concerned and may form a convenientnucleus for development in other directions.  78.  The transfer  of the electricity undertaking  in the added area to the Local Authority would in many cases, therefore, deprive theother  undertakers of  one of the more remunerative parts of their area,  and apart from  any technical difficulties as to  severance,would make it more  difficult for  such undertakers to develop theremainder of their area on an economic basis.  79.  (2) While  the modifications of Local Government boundariesfrequently  take  the  form  of  amalgamations of Local  Authoritydistricts into larger units,  they are also usually accompanied bynumerous  minor modifications of boundaries as  between  adjacentLocal Authorities,  thus  affecting the  position of  those  LocalAuthorities which have rights of purchase for the particular areas concerned.  80.  It would seem,  therefore, that on the whole such adjustmentstend to multiply the  number of Local Authorities having the rightto purchase so much of an electricity undertaking  as is within itsdistrict.  81.  With regard  to the development of the supply of electricityin rural areas, the position is far from satisfactory.  82.  While rights  to  supply electricity  now  exist in  respect  of practically the whole  of the country, the fact that until recent yearsOrders were, with few exceptions, only taken out for the more densely populated and remunerative areas has necessarily meant  that the rural areas were  left to be dealt with separately and at a later stage.For this  reason, development in  the rural areas on an  economic basis and at attractive tariffs has been rendered much more difficult.
   83. Many of the complaints which have been made as to the lack of development in rural areas do not appear to take into account the difficulties with which the supply authorities have to contend.    NEED  FOR  REORGANISATION-BASIS  SUGGESTED   84. In  all the  circumstances and having regard to the evidence placed before us  there can, in our opinion, be no question that an improvement in the present organisation can and must be effected.   85. In  practically every case the Associations and witnesses who have appeared before us have stated that the present organisation is unsatisfactory and calls for improvement.  As might be  expected, however,  there is considerable divergence of opinion as to the nature and extent of the action which ought to be taken.   86. For example, it was  suggested that the supply of electricity should be placed on a national basis comparable to the Post Office organisation, by the establishment of one National Electricity Board to which would be transferred all authorised electricity undertakings, the grid system, railway and traction generating stations and certain non-statutory undertakings ;  and  that  the new Board should also take the  place of  the Electricity  Commissioners and the Central Electricity  Board  and  become responsible  for  the  direction and for  securing  the  efficient  management of  the  nationally-owned undertaking.  87. It was  also  suggested  that  all that was necessary was the elimination of what were described as &quot; weak spots.&quot;  88. As a result of the evidence we have taken, it appears to us that, broadly speaking,  any scheme for the improvement of distribution must, in principle, involve the adoption of one or other of the following alternatives :       (1) Immediate and complete reorganisation on a regional basis     under public control, by the setting up of regional boards which     would buy out all the existing undertakings ;      (2) The retention and utilisation, where possible, of the larger     and more efficient  of the existing  undertakings (both public     authorities and companies) and the absorption by such under-     takings of the smaller and less efficient undertakings.  89. We have come to  the conclusion  that a scheme of  completereorganisation which  would involve  the vesting  of  all electricity undertakings in a number of regional boards must result in a serious and unnecessary dislocation of the supply industry.  90. Moreover, as fair compensation would have to be paid for theacquired undertakings, there must  necessarily be great uncertainty as to the actual amount which would be payable, even if parliament were to lay down  certain broad principles.  It must be  borne  in
mind  that  in addition to Distribution Companies whose  terms of purchase at the end of their franchise are already defined, it would benecessary to deal with Power Companies with rights in perpetuityfor which no defined basis of purchase exists at the present time, andwith Local  Authorities both large and small.  Whether such amountmight not impose an undue burden on the new authorities by way ofcapital charges, which would be detrimental to existing consumers andto future development, must necessarily be  a matter for conjecture.  91.  The fact  that it has been found possible to vest  the  controlof generation and main transmission throughout the United  kingdom in the  Central Electricity Board (operating for administrative con-venience on the basis of a small number of regional  areas)  is not, inour opinion, conclusive evidence that the distribution  of  electricityshould be organised on a similar basis.  92.  We are of opinion that a reorganisation of such a revolutionarycharacter would only  be justified if  it were beyond doubt that theconstituent bodies in the Electricity Supply Industry, as distinct fromthe organisation of the Industry as a  whole, were generally inefficientand unprogressive, and  incapable of being improved  on a  moreevolutionary basis.  93.  On the contrary, there has  been abundant evidence to  showthat, taken as  a  whole, the Electricit)^ Supply Industry has maderemarkable progress, particularly during the last ten years, notwith-standing its complicated and, in many cases, uneconomic  structure and the trade depression from which the country is now emerging,and that a  progressive and enterprising policy  has been adopted by many undertakings.  94.  The statistics given in Table III in Appendix II show that:        (i) the sales of electricity  to  consumers  for  all  purposes    increased from 3,512 million units in 1920-21 to 11,467 million    units in 1933-34 ;  for lighting, heating,  cooking from 582 million    units in 1920-21 to 3,916 million units in 1933-34, and  for power    supplies, from 2,499  million units in 1920-21 to  6,392 million    units in 1933-34 ;       (ii) the charges for electricity  as measured  by  the average    revenue received per unit of electricity sold, decreased in the case    of supplies for lighting, heating, cooking and  shop and  office    purposes, from 5-75^. in  1921-22 to 2-2Sd. in 1933-34;  and    in the  case of power supplies from l-QQd. in 1921-22 to 0-73d. in    1933-34.   The  overall  average  revenue  from all classes  of    supplies to consumers, including public lighting and traction    (but excluding bulk supplies), decreased from 2-ASd. per unit in    1921-22 to 1 -2M. in  1933-34 ;       (iii)  the  number  of consumers  connected  increased  from    2,600,000 in  1927-28, the first year for which official statistics of    consumers were available, to  6,109,000 by the  end of 1933-34.
  95. An examination of the Table shows that there is a markedtendency for the later annual increases to be greater notwithstanding that a greater degree of development is being recorded each year.We have also had evidence that there has been continued progresssince the date to which the figures are given.  96. The progress which is being made to-day by. individual under-takings is, however, uneven and there is no uniform  standard of efficiency among either the large or the small undertakings.  97. We are satisfied that a substantial measure of simplificationand  co-ordination  of the present  structure is necessary if the fullestmeasure of development is  to be achieved throughout  the  countryin the future.  98. We therefore recommend that the basis of reorganisation whichshould be adopted should be that outlined in the second of the two alternatives referred to  in paragraph 88, namely, the retention andutilisation where possible  of the larger and more efficient of  theexisting undertakings, and the absorption by such undertakings ofthose which are smaller and less efficient.  99. The essential objects of any such scheme must include :        (1) A substantial reduction in the present number of under-     takings by the substitution, where appropriate, of larger and     more economic units.       (2) The prevention of the  splitting up  of comprehensive     undertakings in consequence of the exercise of rights of purchase     by individual  local  authorities.       (3) The elimination  of duplicate powers wherever they exist     in the same area.  100. While size alone  is admittedly no criterion of efficiency, therecan  be no  question  that a large  electricity  supply undertakingefficiently operated and managed has inherent advantages which thesmall undertaking  cannot enjoy.  101. Among the advantages which accrue to a large undertakingoperating over a  comprehensive area, when  compared with  theoperation of the same area by a  number of smaller units, referencemay be made to the following: &apos;       (a) Improved Technical Layout and Economy of Capital                           Expenditure  102. While low voltage distribution from high voltage sub-stationsis similar in both large and small undertakings, the elimination of amultiplicity of boundaries, between small undertakings,  and  thedevelopment of an area on a comprehensive scale, enables the highvoltage system to be laid out more efficiently from the point of viewof continuity of supply, and at a considerable economy in cost.
  103. Evidence has been given to show that even though expendi-ture incurred on existing development has to be taken into account,substantial  savings  can be realised  in  all future development byplanning on a  wider scale.  Furthermore, the removal of a multi-plicity of boundaries would enable low voltage distribution to becarried out  on  a more flexible basis, and would  avoid  many of thedifficulties which arise both where low voltage mains are carried outby two adjacent undertakings to dead ends on  opposite sides  of aboundary and also where one undertaking carries a low voltage mainto its boundary and cannot supply premises just beyond because theyare in the area  of another authority.                      (b) Diversity of Load  104. A general advantage results  when an area is sufficientlycomprehensive to include supplies for all the principal purposes forwhich electricity can be utilised such as industrial power, domestic and commercial requirements, public lighting and traction.   In suchcases there is always a diversity between the times when the maximumdemands in kilowatts for  these various classes of supply occur, witha resultant high load factor.  105. From the evidence it is clear that many of the smaller under-takings have not the benefit of such diversity.  In some cases this isdue to the fact  that owing to the small extent of the area it does not contain the  different classes of load.  106. In other cases an  important part of  the load such as, forexample, industrial supplies, is lost to the small  undertaking either because :       (a) it is  being served by a Power  Company (the small under-  taking only distributing for domestic or similar purposes) ;  or      (b) the small undertaking is unable to secure such load either   because of its inability, owing to high distribution costs, to quote   a sufficiently attractive price, or because of its reluctance to incur   capital  commitments which, if for any reason the supplies are   subsequently discontinued, would impose a serious burden on the   undertaking.  The result under any of the foregoing conditions is the same, namely,a low load factor.  107. We are  aware that in certain cases it is possible for the smallerundertakings to come to  a special arrangement with the  central electricity Board in regard to bulk supply terms so as to enable themto deal with large demands of a special  character, which may arise in their areas, but this course is only practicable where the load  is ofan exceptional  nature.
  108. Judicious grouping of many of the existing undertakings intolarger units and the elimination of duplicate powers of supply shouldundoubtedly result in greater diversity of load being obtained in the consolidated  area.   This in turn would result  in a considerably improved load factor which  is an  important and necessary con-tribution to  the attainment of  reduced costs, since more units ofelectricity are sold for each kilowatt of demand, on which the capital investment of any undertaking depends.                     (c) Financial Resources  109. The financial resources of large undertakings enable them totake a long view and to take certain risks in proceeding with schemesof development such as  standardisation of systems or extensions ofmains, which  though possibly unremunerative for a  period  areexpected eventually to show improved results.  110. Small undertakings must necessarily adopt a more cautiouspolicy in  such matters  since any loss on  a particular scheme ofdevelopment would  impose a proportionately more serious  burden on the undertaking than would be the case where such a scheme wascarried out by a larger undertaking.  111. Furthermore, small undertakings are in some cases reluctant to  adopt  a  progressive scheme  of commercial  development  by offering facilities for hire, hire purchase and assisted wiring and lowtariffs possibly  because the cost of providing mains  and apparatus tomeet the increased  demand  which arises  from the offer  of such facilities, may  be  felt to be beyond the financial capacity of theundertaking.                      (d) Central Purchasing  112. The larger undertakings are clearly in a  more favourable position  than  the small undertakings  to negotiate contracts and obtain trade discounts  in connection with the purchase of cables,apparatus, etc.  113. In  the  case of individual purchases by a  number of smallAuthorities there is almost a custom, we are told, for each Authorityto require some special modification of  a  particular type of cable orapparatus, thereby increasing the cost of production to  the manu-facturers.  If the purchasing is concentrated in the hands of a smaller number  of larger undertakings, there  will  be  a greater tendency towards  standardisation of type,  thereby reducing  the  cost ofproduction.                          (e) Personnel  114. It is of the utmost importance that, with a view to ensuring that undertakings are operated and managed on the most efficientbasis, the chief executive officers of the  undertakings should  be menof the highest  qualifications.
  115.  There can also be no question that to secure  a substantialdemand for electricity it  is essential that all undertakings should adopt a progressive sales and development policy, and that  for sucha policy to be effective the undertakings must  employ expert and well-paid technical and commercial staffs.  116.  This is particularly necessary at  the present time when theuses to which electricity is being put take so many new forms,  oftenof a highly technical nature.   Many of  the larger  undertakings(particularly in industrial areas) employ individual  experts to dealwith different classes of supply.  117.  The larger undertakings have the financial resources&apos;to paysalaries which will  attract the right type of man with  the necessaryqualifications for these various expert positions.   In the case of thesmaller undertakings all the duties have to be  concentrated in thehands of the senior executive officer, and in many cases the under-takings appear to be unable to pay the salary necessary, not only to attract, but also to retain a man with the qualifications necessary toenable him to deal with all the varied aspects of electricity supply.  118.  In general  and apart from the advantages  outlined in thepreceding paragraphs, we are satisfied that from the  point of viewof future  development  the elimination  of a  large  number of thesmaller undertakings and  their amalgamation or co-ordination withlarger units is the only practical means whereby substantial progress can be made towards standardisation of  systems and methods of charge, and also towards greater uniformity in actual charges.  119.  In support of the foregoing considerations,  evidence  showsthat in  certain cases  undertakers  (both public authorities and companies) have themselves effected voluntary amalgamations fromwhich substantial advantages have materialised.  This has resultedin a standardisation of tariffs and other advantages  of centralisedcontrol, together with a substantial reduction  of price  to consumers.  120.  Even where geographically separated undertakings are underthe control of a  single  company, we are  satisfied  that certain advantages have accrued  to the consumers  in the  several  areas.These advantages have resulted from the provision of  a more highly skilled and better paid technical management ;  a uniform  directionof policy in the framing of tariffs ;  a greater ability to standardisesystems  and voltages on account of the greater resources arisingfrom the combination ; and the consequential economy of centralisedpurchasing of stores and materials.  121.  Evidence has been adduced  to  show that in  certain  cases small undertakings have adopted a progressive policy, and,  owing to particularly favourable local conditions, are able to charge lower prices for certain classes of supply than some of the larger  undertakings.
  122. While, however,  the fullest recognition should be given tothe good work which has been carried out by many small undertakings,often under difficult circumstances, we feel bound to endorse the view expressed by the Electric Power Supply Committee in 1918 that theobject to  be kept  in view is not merely to have  exceptionally lowcosts in a few small and specially favoured areas, but rather to havethe same or lower  costs available over wider areas.  For this reasonwe  emphasise the necessity that any  regrouping of undertakingsshould be carried out on a reasonably comprehensive scale.  123. The necessity for a wider outlook is, in our opinion, particu-larly important  in connection with the development of supplies ofelectricity in rural areas.  124. Owing to the low density of population and to the scatteredlocation of premises, the supply of electricity in rural areas gives riseto problems of some difficulty from the point of view of carrying outdevelopment on an  economic basis and at attractive tariffs.  Theposition has been rendered still more difficult by the prior independentdevelopment of the urban areas.  125. We regard the problem of bringing a supply into the rural areas and extending it as widely as possible as being one of primary importance from a national point of view, for reasons which are dealtwith more fully in a later part of the Report (see paragraph 372 et seq).  126. There can be no doubt that if instead  of having to deal withthe present complex structure a system of distribution were being planned anew, adequate provision would be made to associate ruralwith urban areas.  127. The difficulties experienced in providing  supplies in manyrural areas under  existing conditions are  due to  the fact that thedevelopment of such areas has in many cases been divorced from thedevelopment of  the urban areas.  We are  satisfied that any schemeof reorganisation for the country as a whole must provide, as far aspossible, for the rural areas being developed in conjunction with the urban areas.  128. Circumstances will  obviously vary in  different  cases, butevidence has shown that it would  by  no means  follow that theassociation of rural  with urban areas would  be detrimental to the urban areas.   Owing to  the different types of load such an associa-tion should result  in a greater diversity of load with a consequent increase of load factor, thereby reducing the cost  of electricity overthe area as a whole.  129. The technical and  administrative personnel required for themanagement of the urban area can  be expanded to deal also withthe  rural  area  at less cost  than would  be necessary to set  up aseparate personnel  for the rural area.   Furthermore, while owingto  the lower density of population  in  the rural area  the capital
charges on  mains,  transformers and  other apparatus  might  ueexpected to form a larger proportion of the total distribution costs,this can to a large extent be offset by the cheaper forms of construc-tion which can be adopted in such areas, e.g.,  by the provision ofoverhead lines instead of underground cables.  Even where in the initial  stages of development the urban area  may  have to carrysome of the  charges in respect of the rural area, there would seemto be no reason to anticipate that when the rural  area has been developed it need be a liability on  the urban area.  In  the courseof evidence, instances have been brought to our notice which support this view.  130.  With regard  to  our major  recommendations we  recognisethat  the conditions  on  which the  full development of electricitydepends  vary  widely even in  adjacent  areas.   A careful  localinvestigation of each area is, in our opinion, a necessary preliminary to the preparation of a  scheme of improvement.  We feel strongly that it would neither be equitable nor practicable to  prescribe whatparticular undertakings  or even what particular size  of undertakingshould  be amalgamated under such a  scheme until  after a surveywhich has taken into account the circumstances of each undertakinghas been made.  131.  It  is,  however, important  that after a  local investigationhas been held and a scheme for improvement has been drawn up,simple machinery should be available for giving effect to the scheme without undue delay.  132.  Past experience has  demonstrated  beyond  question thatany attempt  to  carry  through on a  voluntary  basis a scheme of reorganisation on the general lines we  have recommended, would be bound to fail.  133.  We would emphasise, therefore, the necessity that legislation should  confer definite and adequate compulsory powers to enableour recommendations to be  carried out effectively.  134.  In considering what further powers of a  compulsory nature would be  necessary,  we feel  that a good deal can  be done by anextension  of  principles which have   already been approved  byParliament.  We have had the same point in view when consideringthe safeguards which would ensure  that after  reorganisation hasbeen effected, the remaining and/or reconstituted undertakers shalladopt and maintain  a  progressive policy  and operate their under-takings to the fullest advantage of the public interest they serve.  135.  We have noted, for instance, that under Section 19 of theElectricity (Supply) Act,  1919, any two or more authorised under-takers may be required in certain circumstances to enter into an
arrangement for the working or management of the whole or partof the undertaking of  one of such undertakers by the other ;  that under Section 13 of the Act  of 1919 local authority purchase rightsmay not (except in the District of a Joint Electricity Authority)be exercised without the consent of the Electricity Commissioners;that under the same section purchase rights may within the district of a Joint Electricity Authority be transferred to the Joint Authority;that under Section 14 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1922, purchaserights may, with the consent of the local authority,  be suspended;that under Section 22 of and the Schedule to the Act of 1922, maxi-mum prices and authorised methods of charge may  be revised andother maximum  prices or methods of  charge substituted  in lieuthereof ;  and that the principle of a sliding scale of price and dividendhas been recognised, not only in Power Acts and other Special  Acts,but also  in the General Acts, particularly the Electricity (Supply)Act of 1926.  136. We have  come to  the conclusion that the detailed task ofmaking local surveys and the preparation of schemes of reorganisationshould not be imposed on the Electricity  Commissioners.  137. The consideration and approval of the schemes of reorganisa-tion,  when prepared,  and the carrying into effect of  the  other recommendations  contained in this Report will, however, involvea considerable amount of  administrative work on the part of  somecentral authority.  138. We  consider that  the Commissioners  should be entrusted with  these further duties  and that  it is unnecessary and would infact be undesirable to envisage the establishment of any new central body for that purpose.  We have received from all  sections of theIndustry evidence  of the  confidence felt in the  ability and impartial-tiality of the Commissioners which justifies us in  recommendingthis course.   139. We must  emphasise that the rapid discharge of such furtheradministrative duties is vital to the success of our proposals.  Theseproposals will necessarily involve a substantial increase in both thevolume and the importance of  the duties  falling  upon the  Com-missioners, and notwithstanding the delegation of the local investi-gations to specially appointed persons to  whom we refer later inthis Report, considerable  pressure  of work on  the  Commissionersis bound to ensue.   140. It is essential,  therefore,  that the  Commissioners should been abled  to provide themselves with officers, both  administrative and technical, on a scale suitable to meet the new demands withoutany avoidable delay otherwise the effect of our recommendationsmay be stultified.
           PROCEDURE FOR REORGANISATION  141.  We recommend that the procedure to  be adopted and the considerations to be  taken into account  should be  on the  lines indicated in the following paragraphs.  142.  Legislation should provide that as soon as may be after thepassing of the Act embodying our recommendations, the ElectricityCommissioners should delimit  the country into a number of areasin respect of which it appears to the Commissioners, prima facie,that a suitable scheme or schemes of amalgamation and co-ordinationshould  be prepared.  143.  In  respect of  each  area so delimited  the  commisioners should  proceed to appoint a specially selected person having suitablequalifications, on whom should  be  imposed  the duty of  making alocal investigation of the undertakings  therein, and  of  preparingand submitting  to  the Commissioners  for  their  consideration  ascheme or schemes of reorganisation for the area.  144.  For want of a more suitable  appellation, the persons soappointed are hereinafter referred to as  &quot; District Commissioners.&quot;Such District Commissioners must necessarily have recourse to theElectricity  Commissioners  for  statistical  and  other  information.We  would  emphasise, however,  that apart  from this the DistrictCommissioners should, in their investigations and in the preparationof the  schemes,  act in complete independence of the  ElectricityCommissioners,  to whom  it would fall  in due course to consider such schemes.  145.  The Electricity  Commissioners  should  be empowered  toappoint such financial and  technical advisers  as are  necessary toassist the  District Commissioners in their  detailed examination ofthe  various undertakings and in the subsequent preparation of theschemes of reorganisation.  In certain cases it is possible  that  withsuch assistance one District Commissioner might be  able to  dealwith more  than  one area.   This, however, is a matter  which  will obviously  depend on  the characteristics of the  various areas asdelimited by the Electricity Commissioners and must be left for their consideration when making the appointments.  146.  The District Commissioners  and  any experts  appointed fortheir assistance should be paid such remuneration as the ElectricityCommissioners may determine,  such remuneration, together  without-of-pocket expenses being paid out of the Funds of the ElectricityCommissioners.  147.  It should be the aim of the District Commissioners to prepareschemes of reorganisation  in collaboration  with, and  if possible byagreement with the undertakers in  the  respective areas.  To thisend  we recommend that  a separate unpaid Advisoiy Committee
should be  constituted in each area comprising  representatives ofall  the authorised undertakers therein.  The Advisory Committeeshould act in a consultative capacity only for the assistance of theDistrict Commissioners.  148. The Electricity Commissioners should  be  empowered to approve  schemes when submitted to  them  by  the District  Com-missioners  with  or without  modification.   Before approving  ascheme the Electricity Commissioners should give the undertakersin the area an opportunity of making representations thereon.  Weare of opinion, however, that  formal inquiries with their attendantdelay and  expense  should be  avoided  and that in most cases con-ferences or a less formal type of hearing would be sufficient and more effective.  149. We  recommend  that  a  scheme  when  approved by theElectricity Commissioners should thereupon become  operative incases :        (a) where  the scheme  as  submitted  by the District  Com-     missioner is  agreed by all the undertakers  concerned, or       (6) where  the output of each of the undertakings proposed     to be acquired  compulsorily under the scheme of amalgamation     did not exceed 10 million units in the year ending 31st March,     1936.  150. This defined limit of  size must  not be  regarded  as anytheoretical measure of efficiency  in individual  cases, but rather asa broad practical means  of determining the nature of  the adminis-trative machinery which  would  only  operate  after a scheme hadbeen prepared and  the relevant circumstances  of each undertakinghad been  taken  into  account.   We  consider  it  essential that inconnection with  the preparation  of  a  scheme  all undertakingsregardless of size should be brought under review.  151. It will be noted from  Table II of Appendix II that in theyear 1933-34, there were  upwards of 400 undertakings, each sellingless than 10 million units per annum and we are informed  that theiraggregate sales in that year represented  less than  10 per cent, ofthe total electricity output of the country.  152. Where, however,  a scheme as submitted to the ElectricityCommissioners provides for the compulsory acquisition or amalgama-tion of an  undertaking whose output is above the defined limit of10  million units  per annum, we recommend  that the procedure should be similar  to that laid down by  Section 26 of the Electricity(Supply)  Act,  1919, namely, that after the approval of the scheme by  the Commissioners it  should  not  become operative unless anduntil it has been confirmed by the Minister of Transport and approvedby Parliament.
   153. Cases may arise where in connection with a scheme providing for the purchase of certain undertakings and their amalgamation with other undertakings, the latter may not desire to be compelled to buy out such undertakings and have them amalgamated with their own undertakings.   In such circumstances, the acquiring under- takings should be  given  the  right  to  elect that they themselves should be bought out and merged in some other undertaking or in some new public body.   154.  Where a scheme  involving the amalgamation of two or more undertakings is approved  by  the Electricity Commissioners, they should be empowered to make such consequential  amendments  or adjustments  in the various Orders or other statutory provisions relating  to  the individual undertakings prior  to  amalgamation, as are  necessary to ensure that the amalgamated undertaking will operate under  consistent  and consolidated statutory provisions. Among other advantages, this would obviate the necessity for keeping separate  accounts for each of the amalgamated  undertakings.   MAJOR  PROBLEMS  IN  PREPARATION  OF SCHEMES  155.  Having  outlined the procedure which we  suggest should be followed  in connection with the preparation and the bringing into operation of schemes of reorganisation  for  the  various  delimited areas, we consider it desirable  at this stage to comment on some  of the major problems which will arise in connection with the preparation of the schemes.  156.  As previously indicated,  the two  principal objects to be achieved  should be the reorganisation, where  necessary,  of the undertakings in a delimited area into a smaller  number  of under- takings of economic size with  adequate financial  resources and the elimination of all duplication of powers.  Such reorganisation should be effected  by utilising, where possible, existing  efficient  under- takings as nuclei for  the purposes of amalgamations and co-ordination. Where  this is not possible, a scheme might provide for the amalgama- tion of  a number of  undertakings into some form of public authority constituted on  a  selected  basis analogous to that of the Central Electricity Board.   We  do not consider that it would be desirable to set up further executive bodies constituted on the elective basisof existing Joint Electricity Authorities.  We also recommend thatit should  be  competent for  the District Commissioners to review theposition of existing  Joint Electricity Authorities.  157.  The  question as to what  would constitute an  undertaking of economic size from the point  of view of any area scheme will necessarily depend on a number of factors which will vary in different cases.   The primary considerations to be taken into account should, however,  be (a) that the area of supply of each undertaking should be sufficiently large to embrace a reasonable diversity of demand,
and  to  ensure  that  future  technical development  can proceed oncomprehensive  lines  and on the most  efficient and economic basis,provision  being made, inter alia, for the grouping together where possible of appropriate rural  and urban areas ;  and (b)  that  theundertaking should have the financial resources to enable it to carryout comprehensive schemes of development, including development which may not be  immediately remunerative ;   to  adopt a  pro-gressive and energetic selling policy ; to be able to pay the salariesrequired to maintain an  efficient  and  fully  qualified personnel;and  to be in a position to reduce tariffs and  charges to the lowestpossible level in anticipation of the increased  demand which would flow therefrom.                     POWER COMPANIES  158. One of  the main  points with  which  the District  Commis-sioners will have to deal in preparing schemes of reorganisation willbe the position of  the Power Companies  and the action that shouldbe taken in regard thereto.  159. Earlier  in this report reference was made to the fact that most Power Companies hold powers of supply of a dual character,namely : &apos;       (a) powers conferred by Special Act, under which the Power     Companies are  usually only  authorised  to  supply electricity     in bulk ;  for  power purposes ;  and for lighting any  premises     where a power  supply is given.  There  are, however, certain     Power Companies whose Special Acts have conferred  on them     powers to supply electricity for all purposes ;       (b) distribution powers obtained  by Provisional or Special     Order, either  directly or through a subsidiary or associated     Company.   Such Orders authorise the  Power  Company  (or     their subsidiary  or associated Company) to supply electricity     for all  purposes.  The  undertakings under such Orders  are     subject to  the ordinary purchase rights of the Act of  1888, or,     in a certain few cases,  to purchase  on the terms laid down in     Section 39  of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1926.  160. So far as the  purchasable undertakings are concerned, it isobvious that if  each of the Local Authorities, or  as would be moreprobable,  the Local Authorities in the more remunerative parts ofthe Power Company&apos;s area, exercised their rights of purchase whenthey fell due, the result would be that a comprehensive undertakingwould be split up  into  a number of  small and comparativelyuneconomic undertakings.  161. It would clearly be a retrograde step to allow such disintegrate-tion  to take place.  The ultimate effect could only be to the detri-ment of the consumers.  This position must  be  dealt with by  the
District  Commissioners and it will be apparent that no scheme of reorganisation will be complete which does not effect some substantial improvement in the conditions under which Power Companies areat present operating.  162. In the majority of cases it will no doubt be found that under an area scheme the Power  Companies  should  be retained on  aconsolidated and improved basis, and if such consolidation is carriedout on sound lines substantial benefits to consumers should accruein the area as a whole.  163. We suggest that where appropriate, the basis of consilidation of the Power Company&apos;s undertaking  should  be on the following lines : -     (a) the  amalgamation  of  the  distribution   undertakings    (whether held by the Power Company or by a subsidiary or   associated Company), with the non-purchasable  undertaking   under the Power Acts ;     (b) the suspension of all  existing local authority rights of   purchase in respect of such distribution undertakings for some   specified equated period ;     (c) the transfer to the  Power Company of such  of the other   smaller  undertakings in or adjacent to the  Power Company&apos;s   area, both local authority and company, as the District Com-   missioners consider necessary, having due regard, inter alia, to   the  consideration that the  transfer of such  undertakings to   the  Power Company will result in a general  improvement in   the area.  164. The  amalgamation of  distribution undertakings with  thePower Act  undertaking for a definite period, free from any inter-mediate liability to purchase by the local authorities, and the transfer,where appropriate to  the consolidated Power Company,  of other undertakings within their area, would however represent a valuableconcession which  could  only  be justified by making provision forultimate public ownership, not only of the distribution undertakings of the Power Company, but also  of  the Power Act  undertaking which under present conditions is not subject to purchase.  165. The provision for the ultimate transfer to public ownership of the Power Act  undertakings is,  in our opinion,  further justified by the fact  that conditions  have altered so materially since such powers were first granted.  166. One of the main purposes for which Power  Companies were established was the generation of electricity in large central general-ing stations and  its transmission and supply  in bulk to  other authorities  over a  large area, and the Cross Committee, in theirReport, appear to have reached the conclusion that undertakings
under  a Power Act should not  normally be  subject to purchasebecause the ordinary purchase provisions at that time would,  as ageneral rule, have been inapplicable to supplies of that nature.  167. Furthermore,  with regard to the main function for whichPower Companies were originally established, control of generation,is now vested in the Central Electricity Board.  While bulk supplies from the Central Electricity Board to undertakings within the  areaof a Power Company must be given through the Power Company,unless   such  undertakings have  an  absolute  veto, the  PowerCompanies are  bound under the Act to pass on such bulk supplies on the same  terms as they purchase them from the Central Board,plus transmission  costs on a defined basis.  168.  The  primary  reason, therefore, why  the undertakings of power Companies were originally exempted  from purchase, has, inour opinion disappeared. Recent acts, such as the Wessex ElectricityAct, 1927, which conferred  powers of  supply over  a  large  areaanalogous in many respects to those held by Power Companies, but which provide for purchase of the  undertaking as a whole by a public authority at the end of a certain period, represent a more appropriateform of legislation under present  day conditions.  169. We recommend, therefore,  that any  scheme whereby a power Company is retained on a consolidated  basis should provide that at the end of a certain period the whole undertaking  of thePower Company, including their  present perpetuity  rights, shouldbe liable to purchase by some form of public authority on the basisof capital expenditure less depreciation.  170. The actual period of any consolidated franchise should  vary according to the circumstances in  the particular areas,  and mightdepend, inter alia, on the present unexpired franchise of the dis-tribution orders.   This would  be a matter  for  the  District Com-missioners to  deal with,  but we recommend  that the maximum period, at the end of which a Power Company, where retained undera scheme, should be liable to have their whole undertaking transferredto a public authority, should be 50 years.  171. During  the consolidated  franchise  the  Power companies should be subject  to financial control, the salient features of whichshould be :        (a) the application of an effective sliding scale relating prices    to profits and including  provision for the  revision of standard    prices when necessary ;       (b) the approval of the terms of issue of new capital;       (c) more effective control  by the Minister of  Transport in    regard to  the methods of  charge for  domestic and similar    supplies.
   172.  Power Companies are already normally subject to a sliding scale of price and dividend,  but owing to changes in circumstances since the standard prices were originally fixed, the prices charged by Power Companies are, in fact, so far below the standard prices that the existing sliding scales are wholly inoperative.   173.  It should therefore be a definite part of any scheme whereby a Power  Company is  retained on a  consolidated basis that the limitation of profits by means of a sliding scale should be put on an effective basis under present-day conditions.   174.  The particular  sliding scale  appropriate to any particular Company must necessarily have regard to the circumstances of each Company, and no hard and fast basis can be laid down in advance.   175. The  following among other considerations should, however, be taken into account:        (a) It would be reasonable to provide that the standard prices    to be fixed in any  sliding scale should be such as would give a    Company their present level of profits (unless it can be shown    that the  Company have been earning  excessive profits)  with    the addition  of some small margin for contingencies.       (b) A reasonable allowance  should be made for unfructified    capital.  There should, however, be  a limitation as to how far    back  capital could be  claimed to  be unremunerative.   We    recommend that unremunerative capital should be restricted to    such capital  spent  in the three years prior to the coming into    operation of a scheme of  development of an area in advance of a    remunerative demand.      (c) The sliding scale should  give the Companies an incentive    to  pursue a progressive policy, and should ensure that  the    Company shall be entitled to participate with consumers in any    growth of profits above the  standard  rate.      id) The Electricity  Commissioners  should be empowered to    revise by Special Order all sliding scales at recurring  periods of    three years if it could be shown that there had been any material    change in the relation between the classes of supply for which    standard prices had been fixed, or in the circumstances under    which the Companies are operating.  176. With regard to  the control of new capital issues, statisticsshow  that capital charges on distribution are responsible for some50 per cent, of the  total distribution costs, and that a reduction of1 per cent, in the  capital charges would be equivalent to 6J per cent.reduction of the revenue.  It is of great importance therefore that all future capital should be raised on  the best possible terms.  177. In  order to ensure that  consumers get  the full benefit  ofcapital being raised on the best possible terms, the approval of theElectricity Commissioners  should be required to the terms of issue
of all forms of new capital proposed to be raised by Power Companies,whether ordinary or preference shares, debentures or loans.  178. Subject, however, to such control of the terms of issue of new capital, Power Companies should have the right to decide for them-selves what form any new capitalisation should take.  179. The necessity for  strengthening the present powers of theMinister of Transport in regard to the revision of maximum prices and methods of charge in the  case of all undertakings is referred toin greater detail in  a later part of this Report (see paragraphs 325,et seq.).  It will suffice at this point to indicate that we recommendthat the Minister  should be empowered to require all undertakers tooffer to their domestic consumers an approved two-part tariff  as anoptional alternative to a flat rate charge, and to revise such two-parttariffs in the same manner as the flat rate maximum can be revised.  180. In the case of Power Companies which  are  given a con-1solidated franchise the existence of such extended powers of revision,coupled with a sliding scale of price and profits and control of theterms of  issue of new  capital, should be an effective protection to consumers.  181. In the case of schemes dealing with Power Companies onthe lines  indicated above  or on any other basis, Special Order pro-cedure should be  followed, that is to say, a scheme as approved bythe Electricity Commissioners should require confirmation by theMinister of Transport and approval by Parliament before it becomesoperative.  182. As previously indicated, we anticipate that in most cases itwill be found possible to evolve a satisfactory scheme for the retentionof the Power Companies on a consolidated basis.  If, however, theDistrict Commissioners find  that it is  not possible to produce asatisfactory scheme of consolidation, or the Power Company ratherthan accept a scheme  of consolidation on the lines proposed prefer to be bought out, it should be competent  for a scheme to providefor the immediate  purchase of the Power Company&apos;s undertaking(including their perpetuity rights) and its  transfer to some  form ofpublic authority.   In this case also Special Order procedure shouldbe followed before a scheme becomes operative.  183. As a  corollary to  the  recommendation that where a  power company&apos;s undertaking is consolidated, other  undertakings in thePower Company&apos;s area should be  transferred to the Power Company  jwhere it  would be to the  general advantage of the area to do so, itshould also be competent for a scheme to provide that, where under-takings in a Power Company area are too large to be transferred tothe Power Company or no general advantage would accrue by sotransferring them,  the Power Company should be required to sell,
and the undertakings in question should be entitled to buy, so muchof the Power Company&apos;s undertaking as is within their district so asto avoid duplication of systems.  184.  A scheme providing for such transfer of part of the under-taking  of a Power Company to another undertaking would have toprovide for compensation to  the  Power Company just as a power company  would have to compensate  the owners of undertakings which might be transferred to the Power Company under a scheme.Such compensation would have to take into account  loss occasioned by severance, as well as loss of profits.  185.  The rights of the Power Companies in such areas would vary.In some cases the undertakers in the area might have an absoluteveto ;  in others only a limited veto, while in others  there might beno veto.  The  value  of the rights  of the Power Company  would,therefore,  vary according to the limitations  (if any)  thereon, apartfrom any actual supplies which the Power Company might be givingand which would be taken over.  186.  We  emphasise  the  importance  of   eliminating  wherever possible all  duplication of  powers  which,  when exercised, mustinvolve duplication of expenditure, and loss of diversity of load.     PURCHASE  RIGHTS  OF LOCAL  AUTHORITIES  187.  We have referred  in an earlier part of this  Report  to  theposition which exists today in regard to the right of j .ocal authorities under the General Acts to purchase so much of a Distribution under-taking  as is situate within their district.  188.  We see  no reason to recommend  any departure from  thegeneral principle laid down by Parliament of  eventual public  owner-ship, and, in  fact,  we  have  recommended  an extension of that principle. * We are satisfied, however, that if schemes of reorganisa-tion are to be carried out on an effective  and permanent  basis  thecircumstances in which rights of purchase may be exercised must besubject  to more definite  control, and  such rights  must only beexercised as  part  of a comprehensive plan embracing an extendedarea.  189.  We have already pointed out that the exercise of individualrights of purchase in respect of a distribution undertaking owned bya Power Company (or a subsidiary or  associated company)  wouldnot only lead to the creation of further cases of duplication of powers,resulting in unnecessary duplication of future capital expenditure,but  would also  involve the splitting up of a comprehensive  under-taking  into  a  number  of small and  comparatively  uneconomicundertakings.  This latter consideration would apply with  equalforce to the exercise of individual rights of purchase in the case of distribution  Companies.(C 21614)C2
   190. We consider it desirable therefore that provision should bemade that  no local  authority rights  of  purchase,  whether under special Acts, Orders, Deeds  of  Transfer  or  otherwise, should be exercisable  without the consent of the Electricity Commissioners.Furthermore, the Commissioners should be empowered to suspendor equate the dates of purchase ; to provide that they may be onlyexercisable jointly by all the local authorities in an area ; and, whereimprovement can be  effected by so doing, to transfer them to someother public authority.   191. It should be competent therefore for an area scheme to dealwith all existing rights of purchase and to provide for their suspensionand equation in the case of all retained Company undertakings.The equated period which should be allowed for a Distribution Com-pany would  depend on the circumstances of each case one of the factors to be taken into account being the unexpired franchise of theCompany which has still to run.   192. The date to which the purchase rights should be suspendedand equated should be such as to allow the Company a reasonabletenure on the consolidated basis, but the revised period should notin any case exceed 50 years.   193. At the end of the consolidated period the undertaking should only be purchasable as a whole by a Joint Board of Local Authorities,or some other public body.  The basis of purchase at the end of the consolidated tenure should be capital  expenditure less depreciationon a scale to be prescribed by the Electricity Commissioners.   194. It should be competent for a scheme to provide that duringsuch consolidated tenure a Distribution Company should be subjectto control similar to that of a Power Company as regards the applica-tion of a sliding scale of price and profits, control of terms of issue ofnew capital, and revision of standard and maximum prices.   195. In the case of local authority undertakings which arve retainedunder an approved scheme and whose  areas of supply also embracethe districts of other local authorities, there can be no justification for the disintegration of the areas by the subsequent exercise of therights of purchase, which the local authorities for the outside districtsat  present  possess  under the Electric  Lighting Act, 1888.  Werecommend, therefore, that in such  cases it should be competent fora scheme to provide that  such rights of purchase shall be rescinded.           TARIFFS  IN AMALGAMATED AREAS   196. Another matter which will have to be considered in preparingarea schemes of reorganisation will be the actual tariffs which are tobe  chargeable in an  amalgamated area after reorganisation, withparticular reference to the tariffs to be charged in the areas of the undertakings  which have been compulsorily transferred under ascheme.
  197. It will be the primary  justification  for any scheme that itwill in due course effect an improvement in the area as a whole.   Animportant factor in securing such improvement will be the adoptionof uniform methods of charge throughout the consolidated area andas far as possible actual uniformity of charges.   In some cases thelatter may have to be brought about in stages and a certain amountof zoning may be necessary for  a transitional period.  It  should,however, be the objective of the  consolidated undertaking to bringabout complete uniformity of charges as soon as possible.  198. We contemplate that in order to  effect an improvement inthe area as a whole, there may be cases where a scheme will providefor the merging of one undertaking with another in which, for certainclasses of supply or on a particular method of charge, the charges ofthe acquired undertaking are lower than those of the undertakingwith  which it is being merged.  199. To protect the position of consumers  in the area  of  theacquired  undertaking,  the  Electricity  Commissioners  should beempowered to insert in a scheme a provision that on acquisition thereshall not be a general increase  in the charges in  the acquired area.In order, however, to obtain uniformity of method of charge it maybe necessary to substitute in the acquired area a  new form of tarifffor that previously in operation in respect  of a  particular class ofsupply.   It will be inevitable in such cases that owing to an  altera-tion  in the method on which  the tariff is calculated there will be some consumers whose actual overall cost may be increased, althoughtaken as a whole the consumers would not be prejudiced, and  in factshould benefit.  200. There may also be cases where the acquired undertaking mayhave been charging an unduly low flat rate for lighting purposes andhave either not offered any two-part tariff at all or a two-part tariffwhich is  not of a form  best calculated to encourage consumers toincrease substantially the use  of  electricity.  In  cases such as  this it may be desirable that the  consolidated  undertaking should beentitled to make some adjustment in charges with a view to putting the lighting flat rate on a more economic basis and to substitute amore satisfactory two-part tariff for that previously in force.  201. As soon as a  consolidated undertaking has  had reasonable time  in  which to  establish itself on  the  reorganised  basis   theadvantages which should flow  from the amalgation should  enableprogressive reductions in charges to consumers to be made from timeto time in respect of the whole area.  202.  There will doubtless be  many cases where the charges of anacquired undertaking are higher than those of the undertaking withwhich they  are being merged.  Here again the objective of the consolidated undertaking should be to bring the charges down to a uniform level as soon as possible.
  203. Whether on amalgamation any reduction in charges shouldbe made, and the period within which they should be brought downto a  uniform level, would necessarily  depend  on the particular circumstances of each case, and would be an appropriate matter tobe dealt with in a scheme.  The advantages flowing from a judiciousamalgamation of undertakings  under a  scheme  should, however,facilitate the early reduction of charges  in the higher  priced areas. TERMS  OF PURCHASE OF ACQUIRED  UNDERTAKINGS  204. We emphasise  that  legislation should  define as clearly aspossible the terms on which undertakings (both local authority and company)  acquired  by or merged  with other undertakings inpursuance of an approved scheme, should be taken over.  205. The terms of acquisition must be such as to give fair com-pensation, both where the acquired undertakings are owned by localauthorities and by companies.  Whereas, however, in the case of company undertakings the public have invested money on the basis that so many years&apos; profits would be available, local authorities haveno inherent right to retain profits except to the extent of 1  per cent.on  the  outstanding debt.  This  percentage  may be  regarded asrecognition of the liability of the general rate fund to bear any deficitson  the  working of the undertaking that  liability ceasing if  thelocal authority give up possession of their undertaking.  206. In the circumstances,  while it is reasonable that the termsof acquisition of company undertakings should include compensationfor loss of future profits,  this should not be a factor in arriving atthe compensation payable  on  the  acquisition  of  local authorityundertakings.  207. One basis for the acquisition of local authority undertakings which has been suggested is payment of an amount equivalent to the outstanding debt plus any net deficit charged to the rates in previous years.  In support of  this view it has been contended that a localauthority must not operate its undertaking for profit  and must, ineffect, operate it for the benefit of the consumers and not of therate payers as a whole.  It would  not, therefore,  be reasonable thata local authority should sell its undertaking for more than is necessaryto liquidate its outstanding liabilities since the payment of any Assuming  excess  of  outstanding  debt would  mean writing  back capitalexpenditure which had already been  written off  and would involvethe purchasing authority in higher capital charges than would havebeen  payable by the local authority.   208. On the other hand it has been  pointed  out that  to adoptoutstanding  debt  as  the basis  of purchase  would  result  in manyunfair anomalies.  The amount  which most undertakings would receive would be considerably less than the depreciated value of the
 assets, owing to the generous sinking fund provisions usually adopted, and many comparatively prosperous undertakings, with little out- standing debt, would receive less than many other undertakings with heavy outstanding loan liabilities.  209. We have come to the conclusion that where a Local Authority undertaking  is bought out compulsorily  it would be  difficult to justify payment of less than the fair value (i.e., cost less depreciation) of the physical  assets, including assets purchased out  of revenue, and we recommend that unless otherwise mutually  agreed this basis should be prescribed in the Act,  whether the purchasing body  is a company  or  another local authority.  210. No addition to  the purchase price of a local authority under- taking should be made either in  respect of any contributions from the rates in previous years, or of the right which  the local authority will give up,  to make  a limited contribution to the rates in certain circumstances.  211. We note that where the area of supply of a local authority undertaker extends  outside their own district, the local authority for  the outside district has the right to purchase  so much of  the undertaking  as  is  situate therein  on  the  terms  of the  Electric Lighting  Act, 1888, i.e.,  on  the  basis  of  the value  without any allowance for goodwill.  212. If the amount receivable by a local authority on the sale of its  undertaking  should be greater than  the amount of the out- standing  debt,  the balance after allowing for the refund  to  the rates of any net deficit incurred in previous years might  reasonably be applied, either directly or indirectly, in some form to  the  benefit of the consumers (as distinct from the ratepayers in general) in  the district of that local authority.  213. Payment of a sum in excess of outstanding debt may involve some increase in the amount of the capital charges to be borne by the purchasing authority.   Such amalgamations will, however, only take place where it is anticipated that the scheme will show a general improvement over the area as a whole.   In  the generality of cases itmay be assumed that it will only be the smaller undertakings whichwill be bought.  The additional liability on the purchasing authority would therefore be small and would  have little effect on the financialposition of the consolidated undertaking.  214.  Furthermore, any such additional  capital  charges  shouldbe more than offset by the savings and advantages which would accrueby merging the smaller undertakings into larger units.  215.  The foregoing terms would  only apply in the case of com-pulsory amalgamations where the  basis of purchase is not otherwiseagreed between the  parties.(C 21614)c4
  216. In the case of voluntary amalgamations where, for instance,a number  of  local authorities combine together to form  a  joint board, the local authorities might well agree that the amalgamationshould be on the basis of outstanding debt.  217. In the case of Power  Companies, fair compensation wouldhave  to be  paid for the purchase of their undertakings, including their  rights of supply in perpetuity.  218. We accordingly recommend that where under an area scheme the undertaking of a Power Company is bought  out forthwith, thebasis  of purchase prescribed by legislation should be :        (a) the fair value (i.e.,  capital cost, less depreciation) of the    physical assets ;       (b)  compensation for loss of future profits.  219. With regard  to (b), so far as the  distribution undertakings of the Power  Company  are concerned, any payment for goodwillshould be based on  the unexpired period of the  existing franchise.In the case of both the distribution undertakings and  the PowerAct undertakings, it is important  that regard should be  had, in calculating future possible profits, to the financial control to whichthe Company would have been subject  if they  had remained inexistence under the new  conditions, in the form, inter alia,  of an effective sliding scale of prices and profits.  In assessing compensationfor loss of future profits, due regard should, of course, be paid to thefact that the undertaker will also receive payment for the fair valueof the physical assets employed in the undertaking.  220. Where a distribution company undertaking is acquired werecommend that, unless  otherwise agreed  by the undertakers  and approved by the Electricity Commissioners, the basis of acquisitionshould be the same as that recommended above in respect of thepurchase of the Power Company undertakings ;  that is to say, the fair value of the physical assets, with the addition of compensationfor loss of future possible profits, limited to the unexpired period oftheir  franchise, and to  the  other  considerations set out above.When calculating future  possible profits of an acquired distributioncompany undertaking it  would be  reasonable to assume that thegrowth of profit would, had the undertaking remained in existenceunder the new conditions, have been limited by a sliding scale.  221. On the assumption (a)  that any payment for goodwill wouldbe based on the unexpired period of the franchise, (b) that the con-sideration  referred  to  in the  immediately  preceding   paragraphwould be taken into account ;  and (c) that the purchasing authority would be a well-established  undertaking whose  financial  position should enable them  to raise capital on the most favourable terms,we see no reason to anticipate that the purchase of Company under-takings on  the  basis recommended should impose  any  burden onthe purchasing Authority.
                              4i                          208  222. We  recommend that in  all cases where a scheme providesfor the acquisition of one undertaking by another, the owners of theacquired undertaking should have a right of appeal on the questionof the amount of the purchase price.  Such appeal should, we think,be made to an Arbitration Tribunal to be set up by the Minister ofTransport.  223. In  some  cases the  purchase  price for  an acquired under-taking, when ascertained, would no doubt be paid in cash.  Theremay, however, be cases where it  would be convenient and advan-tageous for the purchase price to be  satisfied by the issue of stockor shares by the purchasing authority.  FURTHER POWERS TO ELECTRICITY  COMMISSIONERS         AFTER REORGANISATION COMPLETED  224. We  have considered whether, after the various area schemesof reorganisation have been approved and become operative, theElectricity Commissioners should have compulsory powers to require futher amalgamations or transfers if a scheme is not considered tobe working satisfactorily.  225. While provision should  be made that  after  a scheme hascome  into  operation  for an area, the  retained undertakers maysubmit  to  the  Electricity Commissioners  for approval,   agreedschemes for  still further  amalgamations  and  the commisioners should be empowered to approve such proposals, we do not considerthat it would be desirable that the Electricity Commissioners shouldbe given compulsory powers to require further amalgamations.  226.  One of the main results which it is anticipated should flow from the scheme of reorganisation recommended is that all  remain-ing undertakers would be  given  an undisturbed franchise for  asubstantial period and would thereby  be  encouraged to adopt anenterprising and progressive policy of development.   The  granting of powers  to the  Electricity  Commissioners  to  require  furtheramalgamations would undoubtedly lead to a feeling of uncertaintyamong all  classes  of  undertakers which would be detrimental toprogressive development, and would nullify to a large  extent theadvantages which should flow from the undertakers being  given  aconsolidated franchise free  from disturbance.  227. Nevertheless, some  form of continuing  control is desirableto ensure that a high standard of efficiency and development shallbe maintained.  We feel that this can be achieved by giving theElectricity  Commissioners power to require undertakers to submitand to carry out approved  schemes of extensions from time to timefor any undeveloped parts of their area where  there is a reasonable prospect of an economic return and to offer facilities for the hireor hire-purchase of apparatus and assisted wiring such as are offered by the more progressive undertakings.
  228. We are of opinion that powers of this nature, which in practicewould probably rarely have to be exercised,  coupled with  the rightof the Minister  of Transport to impose a  statutory two-part tariffand to revise it from time to time, should be  sufficient to ensure thegeneral adoption of a progressive policy by  the various undertakings.  229. We believe that a  more uniform  and  higher  standard ofprogressive development might be maintained (a)  if there was agreater measure of consultation between the undertakers themselvesin the different areas, and (b) if a competitive  spirit could be fosteredamong the undertakings to a greater extent  than exists at present.                  ADVISORY COMMITTEES  230. On the first point we consider that it would be advantageousfrom many points of view, if after an area scheme of reorganisationhas come into  operation,  the Advisory  Committee  formed fromrepresentatives of the undertakers, which we  have recommendedshould be appointed to collaborate with the District Commissioners,were retained permanently.  231. The  membership  of  such  Advisory  Committees would necessarily have to be modified owing, inter alia, to the reductionin the number of undertakings in the various areas which wouldresult from the schemes of reorganisation.  232. The  Advisory  Committees, which would meet at regular intervals, would provide  a useful  means  for interchange  of ideasbetween  the  different  undertakings in an area, more particularly from  the point of view of the methods to be  adopted for promotingand securing the necessary continued expansion of demand, whichis the primary consideration in effecting a  reduction of costs.  233. The Advisory Committees could deal  moreover with various matters  connected with  further  electrical  development,  such asimproved schemes for the hire  or  hire-purchase  of  apparatus,assisted wiring,  the possibility of securing greater  standardisation of the existing forms of tariffs among the undertakers  in  an area,and the introduction of new tariffs to meet  new  and special types of demand.                          STATISTICS  234. With regard to the second point referred to in paragraph 229,we  have noted that  all  authorised undertakers  render annualstatistical returns  to the  Electricity Commissioners, certain  par-ticulars from which are published by the Commissioners in an annualstatistical volume.  Such  statistics  when published are  of  great value, but owing to the mass of detail involved  in their compilationand no doubt to the difficulty in certain  cases in securing prompt
 returns from  the undertakers,  there is  necessarily  a considerable time lag between the period to which the statistics relate and their actual date of publication.  235. The  reduction of the present multiplicity of undertakings to a much smaller number, on a consolidated basis, will facilitate both the preparation of the statistical returns by the undertakers themselves, and their compilation by the Electricity Commissioners.  236. We feel that it would tend considerably to inculcate a com- petitive spirit  among the various undertakings if the  Commissioners were to obtain and publish, on a  quarterly basis, a limited number of the salient statistics  which would be indicative  of the growth of development on the part of the several undertakings, such as, for example, figures relating to length of mains  laid ;  units sold and revenue for  different classes of supply ;  the  number of  consumers connected ;  the number of principal types of domestic  apparatus on hire or hire-purchase ;  and the number of consumers supplied under assisted wiring schemes.  237.  It would seem that the existing powers of the Electricity Commissioners  under Section 27  of  the Electricity  (Supply) Act, 1919, are sufficiently wide to enable them to call for such returns.            MINOR ADJUSTMENTS OF  AREAS  238.  Reference has been made in previous parts of the Report to difficulties which have arisen as a result of the numerous alterations of local government boundaries effected by County Review orders under the Local Government Act, 1929.   In some cases the adjust-ments of boundaries may relate to areas of considerable extent orto areas in which there is considerable density of population  repre-senting a substantial potential demand  for a supply of electricity.  239. The question whether, in view of the alterations of the local government  boundaries,  there should in such cases  be any  corre- sponding alteration in the areas of supply  of  the electricity under- takings concerned, would be one of the matters to be considered by the District Commissioners and taken into account in the preparation of area schemes.  It may be assumed, therefore, that such schemes will resolve the major difficulties which have arisen as a consequenceof the County  Review Orders.  240.  There may, however, be minor adjustments  of area whichwill not be dealt with by the District Commissioners.  In the eventof application  being made to the  Electricity  Commissioners for an adjustment of  the electricity areas  of  supply in such  cases, werecommend  that  the Commissioners  should,  after hearing  the undertakers concerned, be empowered, if they think fit,  to  make such adjustments  as  appear to them to be necessary or desirable,by a simple  deed of transfer.
   241. The  undertakers  concerned  should not  have  a right ofappeal, except on the  question of the compensation to be  paid ifthey are deprived of a part of their area in which they have providedmains and are affording a supply.  In such cases the basis of purchaseshould be the fair value of the assets transferred, with the additionof compensation  for loss occasioned by severance.  The undertakersin question should have a right of appeal on the amount of purchase price to  the  Arbitration Tribunal previously referred  to.   242. It would  also be desirable to  give  the  Electricity Commis-sioners further powers to make minor adjustments of area as betweenadjacent  supply  authorities.   We have  noted that boundaries of areas of supply are frequently irregular in shape, and it would seem that in many cases  a part  of a distributors area  of supply, which forms a salient into the area of supply of the adjacent undertaker,but  which is not being supplied  by the former undertaker, couldbe supplied economically  and efficiently by the latter.   243. In certain cases the adjoining undertaker is supplying salientsof this nature by  means of what are known as Fringe Orders granted under Section 6  of  the Electric Lighting Act,  1909.   It is noted,however,  that Orders granted  under that Section must be  limitedto specific premises  and cannot confer general powers of supply inany  particular district.  Furthermore, it is understood that it isthe general practice  to insert in such Orders a provision giving theundertakers for the area a right, in due course, to buy out the FringeOrder supplies.   244. We see no reason why Fringe Order procedure should not becontinued and might, in fact, be extended where supplies to isolatedpremises are concerned.  Where, however, undertakers have notdeveloped outlying parts of  their area and are not prepared to do sowithin a reasonably short period, and the undertaker for the adjacentarea is able and willing  to supply such areas, we recommend that a simple procedure should be  laid down whereby  the  ElectricityCommissioners by a deed  of transfer could transfer  the area inquestion  from one undertaker  to  the  other on  a permanent basis.We think the undertaker from  whom the area is transferred  shouldhave no  claim to compensation in such circumstances.                           LONDON  245. In view of the basis of reorganisation which we have recom-mended, namely, that the Electricity Commissioners should delimitthe country into areas,  and should in respect of each area appoint a District Commissioner to prepare a scheme of reorganisation forthe area, it would be inappropriate to make any general suggestion in our Report as to the  actual constitution of the various areas.
  246. We feel, however, that the position in the London and Home&quot;8&quot;Counties Electricity District as  constituted by the London  and home Counties  Electricity  District Order, 1925, calls for special consideration, and we have taken a considerable amount of evidence in respect of  that District.  247. The London and Home Counties Joint Electricity authority was established and incorporated by the above-mentioned DistrictOrder made under Section 7 of the Electricity (Supply)  Act,  1919.The District  as constituted comprises the Administrative County ofLondon, the  City of London, the County of Middlesex, the county boroughs of  Croydon, East  Ham and West Ham, and parts of the counties of Berks., Bucks., Essex, Hertford, Kent and Surrey.  Thetotal  area of the District  is approximately  1,841  square miles,embracing a population of approximately 9 millions and having anassessable vale of some  100 millions.  248. The Joint  Authority originally consisted of  33 members appointed or  elected on the following basis :            Local Authority Undertakers    ..     ..   14           Company Undertakers   . .     . .     . .    5           County Councils   ..     ..     ..     . .    9           The Corporation of the City of London  . .    1           Workers in the Industry        ..     ..    2           Railway Companies&apos; Association      . .    2The membership has since been increased to 36 by Amending orders which were made in 1931 and 1932, transferring the rights of purchaseof certain Local Authorities to the Joint Authority,  and giving  suchLocal Authorities representation  on the Joint Authority.  249. The Order of 1925 included the main outlines of a technicalscheme  for the District,  indicating, inter alia,  Generating Stationswhich might be regarded as suitable for use and extension, and maintransmission  lines which  might be regarded as required during thefirst stage  of development to interconnect the various generating stations.  250. The Joint Authority were empowered to acquire by agreement the Generating Stations and main transmission lines of constituentbodies on terms to  be approved by the Electricity  Commissioners,and were required to submit to the Commissioners, within a  pre-scribed period, proposals for the provision of a supply of electricityin those parts of the District which were not  within the area of supplyof another distributor.  251. The Order of 1925 was in effect complementary to the  pro-visions which  were enacted in the same year in the London Electricity(No. 1)  Act,  1925,  and the London Electricity (No. 2)  Act,  1925.These Acts applied to the 14 Companies which were at  that  timesupplying electricity within  the County of  London, the No.  1  Act
relating to what were known as the 4 East End Companies (namely,the City  of London,  the County of London, South  London andSouth Metropolitan Companies),  and the No. 2 Act relating to theremaining  10 London  Companies  (namely,  the  Brompton  andKensington,  Charing  Cross,  Chelsea,  London  Electric  Supply,Metropolitan,  Kensington  and  Knightsbridge,  Notting Hill, St.James  and  Pall  Mall, Westminster Electric Supply  and  CentralElectric Supply Companies) and also  to the Company originallystyled the London Electricity Joint Committee (1920),  Limited, andsubsequently renamed the London Power Company,  Limited, ofwhich the preceding 10 Companies were  constituent members.  252.  The Acts gave effect to a settlement arrived at between theLondon County Council and the Companies concerned,  as a result ofwhich the purchase rights of the  London County Council in respectof the Companies&apos; undertakings were suspended until 31st December,1971,  and it was provided that  on that date the  undertakings inquestion should be transferred  to the Joint Authority  on the terms set  out in the Agreements scheduled  to the Acts, and that thedividends  of the London Companies should be regulated in accord-ance with  a prescribed sliding scale of price and dividend.  253.  By the No. 2 Act the London Power Company, Limited, wereconstituted as authorised undertakers and as a Power  Company foran area of supply comprising the authorised areas of supply withinthe Administrative County of London  of their ten  constitutentCompanies, and provision was made for  the leasing or transfer to thePower   Company of  specified  generating stations  and/or  maintransmission line&apos;s of the constituent  Companies.  This  proposal wasduly carried into effect.  254.  Both Acts provided that with the approval of the ElectricityCommissioners the Companies concerned might enter into and carryinto effect voluntary arrangements for, inter alia, the amalgamation of their undertakings.  255.  This amalgamation was  not accomplished in  either case,possibly due to the absence of  adequate powers to  compel theCompanies to  amalgamate.  256.  A new Company, namely, the London Associated electricity undertakings, Limited, has, however, recently acquired the  share capital of six of the Companies operating in the West End of London,namely, the Brompton and Kensington, Charing Cross, Chelsea,Kensington  and  Knightsbridge,  St.  James and  Pall  Mall  andWestminster Companies, with  a  view to the development of those companies on a co-ordinated basis.  257. The absence of compulsory powers in the Electricity (Supply)Act of  1919 with regard to the transfer  to the Joint  Authority of generating  Stations  and main  transmission lines prevented the
                              47                           211effectual  carrying  out  of  a comprehensive technical  scheme ofdevelopment.  The subsequent enactment of the Electricity (Supply)Act,  1926,  establishing  the Central Electricity  Board  virtuallyinvolved  the supersession of the Joint Authority  as the authorityfor the control of generation in the district.  258. In view, however,  of  the  position accorded  to the joint authority by the Act of 1926, the Central Electricity Board wereprecluded from supplying electricity in bulk direct to  any under-takers in the District other than the owners  of Selected Stations.We are informed, however, that the Joint Authority have enteredinto an agreement with the Central Board in regard to the terms andconditions on which they obtain a  bulk supply from the Board andpass it on to the owners of the non-selected stations in the District.  259. The Order of 1925  did  not  provide for the transfer to theJoint Authority of the rights of purchase of the Local Authorities inthe District as a whole, but, as indicated above, by Amending orders made in 1931 and 1932 the rights of purchase in certain parts of theDistrict were transferred to the Joint Authority.  The transferredpurchase  rights  related  to  the undertakings  of  seven  companies.Six of these  have, in fact, been acquired by the Joint Authority byagreement with the  Companies concerned and  with the concurrence of the Local Authorities, and have been amalgamated by the joint authority into one homogeneous distribution area. The result hasbeen that the Joint  Authority have developed supplies in that  area on standardised lines of charges and tariffs, hire and hire-purchase of apparatus, assisted wiring schemes, etc.  260. The  amalgamation  of these undertakings  is an  example ofthe type of reorganisation which we recommend.  261. The number of authorised undertakings in the London and home Counties District  at the  present time, including the LondonPower Company, Limited, is 82, comprised  as follows : The Joint Authority	Metropolitan Borough Councils ..	16Extra London Local Authorities . .	29London Companies	14Extra London Companies ..	22                                                 -   36                                                      82  262. We  are informed  that  these numerous undertakings  are subject to no  less  than 243 separate Private Acts of Parliament,Provisional and Special Orders,  many of which are extensions orvariations of the original statutes.
   263. The existence of such a large number of undertakings in the District supplying at different tariffs, and at different voltages, and offering unequal facilities for the hire and hire-purchase of apparatus, and schemes of assisted wiring, etc., is clearly detrimental to  the furtherance of a cheap  supply of electricity throughout the District. This has given rise to justifiable complaints on the part of consumers.   264. The position is  further complicated by the fact that within the County  of London two,  and in one case three, Distribution Authorities hold full competitive powers over a considerable part of the area.   Such competitive powers were, as indicated earlier in this Report, originally  granted at a time when alternating current was first being adopted as an  alternative system  of supply  to direct current.   265. So far, however, as the Company undertakings are concerned, we feel that  there may be a tendency to over-emphasise the lack of uniformity in  methods  of charge  and  systems of  supply  since it appears that out  of the 36  Companies no fewer than 30 fall into five groups of controlled or associated Companies and that in each group  a common policy is being pursued.   266.  Nevertheless, a  substantially greater measure of amalgama- tion and co-ordination of both local authority and company under- takings in the Greater London Area is clearly necessary if the best results are to be achieved.   267. We have considered  whether having  regard  to  the special circumstances applying to  the London and Home Counties District there should be any departure from the basis of reorganisation which we have recommended for the remainder of the country, and whether there would be  justification  for a proposal made  to us in evidence that all the undertakings in the District should be acquired by and amalgamated under one new Distribution Authority.   268. As is  known certain public  services are  organised under one administration  for the  whole  of the Greater London area as, for example,  water supplies and more recently,  transport.   This does not, however, apply to the supply of gas.   269. We are not satisfied that the Greater  London Area with  its.vast population and its many  different characteristics is a suitable area to be administered as one unit  from  the point of view of thedistribution of electricity.   270. The need  for effective  local contact between the  Supply Authority and the Districts which it serves is of special importancein the  Greater London Area, where the different  types of area call for different types of development.   271. If all the undertakings were amalgamated under one adminis- tration, not only would it be necessary to organise so wide, densely
212populated and complex a District into a number of sub-areas, but asubstantial devolution  of  powers would be essential in respect ofeach sub-area in order  to  maintain local contact and to ensure theright type of development.  272.  Furthermore, there must necessarily be uncertainty as tothe cost of  acquiring  all the undertakings, which include certainundertakings not  at  present subject  to purchase.  We  are not satisfied that if the cost of purchase involved additional burdens byway of capital charges there  would be commensurate benefits as aresult of the amalgamation.  273.  In all the circumstances, therefore, we see no reason why our recommendation as to the basis on which schemes  of reorganisationshould  be prepared in respect of other parts of the country, shouldnot apply to the  Greater London Area, namely, that a district commissioner should be appointed by the Electricity commissioners to prepare a scheme or schemes for the improvement of  distribution in the   London  and Home  Counties Electricity  District.  these schemes should have as their object such amalgamations as appearto be desirable.  In this way the existing 82 separate organisationsshould  be substantially reduced in number.  274.  The constitution of the London  and Home  Counties joint electricity Authority is a  matter to which we consider it necessaryto refer in some detail.  275.  One of the  primary functions of the Authority as defined bythe Electricity (Supply) Act,  1919, was the co-ordination of genera-tion and  main transmission throughout the Electricity  District.Having regard to  the powers and duties subsequently conferred onthe Central Electricity Board by the Act of  1926  the duties of theAuthority in this  respect have, as  already  stated,  been virtuallysuperseded.  276.  Evidence has been given to show that the Joint authority have  endeavoured to  secure  co-ordination  of  distribution  byformulating schemes for certain areas, involving the transfer to theJoint Authority of the rights of purchase of Local Authorities inthose areas, and that in certain cases the schemes have been success-fully carried out.  If, however, our recommendations are  adopted,the preparation  of schemes  of this nature for  other parts  of theGreater  London  area would  be  undertaken   by the  district commissioner.   277.  Our attention has  also been drawn to another aspect of theconstitution of the Joint  Authority in that  they  have  to  combinecertain administrative functions in respect of the Electricity Districtas a whole with the actual distribution  of electricity on their own account in one part of that District.
  278. It has been suggested that the Joint Authority as at present constituted on an elective basis are not a suitable body to exercise such administrative functions or to secure any substantial measure of standardisation  among the various undertakings  in  the greater london Area on matters such as methods of charge, systems of supplyand facilities to consumers ;  and that they should be superseded bya more permanent Board comprising a  small number of speciallyselected (not elected) members.  279. Whether the Joint  Authority  should be retained in theirpresent- form or with  some modification in  their constitution will necessarily depend on the result of the investigations of the district commissioner.   We  are of  opinion  that their constitution  and functions must  be fully considered by  the  District Commissionerwhen preparing a scheme of  re-organisation.  280. The District  Commissioner should also  consider whether,after a scheme of reorganisation  for the Greater London Area hascome into operation, a greater uniformity of  practice is more likelyto be secured by a continuing Advisory Committee representative ofthe undertakers  themselves such as we have recommended for otherscheme areas throughout the country.  281. We do not see any reason to recommend any variation in thesettlement provided by the  London Electricity Acts of 1925  exceptin so far  as may be necessary to bring such settlement into line withany amalgamation of the Companies concerned, as a result  of ascheme prepared by the District Commissioner.                   HOLDING COMPANIES  282. From the evidence we have received,  it is  clear that theassociation of Companies by means of one Company holding shares in other Companies has become a common type of financial structure in the industry.  283. The relationship between a Holding  Company and a Sub-sidiary  Company may  fall under  one  or more  of  the  following catergories :        1. A Holding Company which is itself an authorised under-    taker  (usually the predominant one of  the group) and which    controls, through shareholdings, other Companies which are also    authorised undertakers.       2. A Holding Company which is not an authorised under-    taker but controls, through shareholdings, Companies which are    authorised undertakers and for which the Holding Company acts    in the capacity of Manager and/or Contractor for constructional    work.
      3.  A Holding Company which is not an authorised undertaker    and controls, through shareholdings, and mainly as investments,    other Companies which are authorised undertakers, but  for    which the  Holding Company does not  act  as  contractor  for    constructional work.  284.  A number of the Companies comprised in the first  classifica-tion mentioned  above partake of the &quot; Holding Company &quot; elementto a limited degree only, as in such cases the capital expenditure ofthe group is, to a preponderating extent, attributable to the under-takings owned and operated  directly by the Holding Company itself,and the shares held in Subsidiary Companies  represent only a small proportion of the capital of the group.  285.  After making allowance for this factor,  however, it remainstrue that the practice of association by means of  shareholdings formsan important element in that part of the industry which is controlled by Companies, as distinct from Local Authorities and other public bodies.  286.  There  would appear  to be some doubt as to the legality ofthe  kind  of  association between  Electricity  Supply  Companiesrepresented by  the above relationships in view of Section 3 of  theSchedule to the  Electric Lighting (Clauses) Act, 1899, and Section 14of the Electric Lighting Act,  1909.  It is open to  question whether,in the  absence of specific authority by Parliament or the  Board ofTrade or the Electricity Commissioners, such association is permissiblewithout incurring  the penalty of  revocation  of the DistributionOrders held by the Associating Companies.  In fact, however,  theBoard of Trade  never thought fit to revoke an Order on this ground,and the Electricity Commissioners, to whom  it  would fall  to advise the Minister of Transport, have followed the same policy.  287.  It will be apparent that, potentially at least, the system of holding Companies  offers  certain  of the advantages which  weenvisage as a result of the amalgamation of the smaller undertakings,such as the benefit of central management, centralised purchasing ofmaterials, provision  of  adequate  financial resources,  etc.  Theevidence which has been placed before us shows that, in fact, HoldingCompanies have, to a considerable extent, achieved the advantagesjust mentioned.  They have also, in planning co-ordinated develop-ment  of their respective groups, in some degree overcome the dis-abilities involved in the physical separation of the various controlledundertakings.  288. On the other hand, the question  of the physical contiguityof undertakings must be of major importance -in relation to manage-ment  and technical planning and development, and the maximumbenefits of centralised control cannot be realised by the associationunder  one  ownership and  management  of undertakings  coveringwidely separated areas.
  289. While, in general, substantial economies can be effected by central purchasing being carried out by one controlling organisation on behalf of a number of small subsidiary Companies, there is aneconomic limit to the advantage accruing from large scale purchasing.We are not satisfied that any considerable benefits accrue  to thelarger subsidiary companies by reason of purchases being  carriedout by a central organisation rather than by these larger subsidiariesthemselves.  290. We have heard criticism to the effect that Holding companies have in some cases acquired their interests in Subsidiary Companiesat an excessive cost,  and that, in order to provide  an  economicreturn on such excessive cost, profits,  and consequently charges for electricity, have been maintained at a higher level than would havebeen the case if the Subsidiary Companies had remained independent.The evidence we have heard does not lead to the conclusion that thishas occurred to any important extent.  291. As a result  of  our consideration of the  statistics and otherevidence placed before us, we are satisfied that most of the holding company groups operating in the Industry have operated efficiently and have done good  work in  extending facilities for the use ofelectricity in the areas they control.   There are, however,  potentialities-tialities  of abuse in this form of structure which have given rise touneasiness in the minds of consumers and the public.  292. The  criticism may briefly  be summed up in the statement that the disclosed profits of a Subsidiary or Associated Company maynot represent the true profits applicable to that Company&apos;s under-taking, for one or more of the  following reasons : -      (1) Where the Holding Company acts in the capacity of agent    or consultant in respect of constructional work carried  out by    the  Subsidiary  Company, and the  purchase  of materials in    connection therewith, in some cases the Holding Company adds    to the  expenditure  on the  work  a percentage  representing    remuneration for the services  performed  by the  Holding    Company.   These services may be of real value in such matters    as large scale  purchasing  of  materials,  obtaining special dis-    counts from suppliers, skilled supervision and engineering, etc.    Nevertheless, there exists  the possibility that the percentage    added to the actual cost of the work carried out may be in excess    of the  real  value of the services  rendered  by the Holding    Company.   In many  cases this percentage is added not merely    to capital expenditure undertaken by the Subsidiary Company,    but also to expenditure in the nature of upkeep and maintenance.    Thus not only may the capital expenditure  be inflated, but the    revenue of the Subsidiary or Associated Company may also bear    an excessive charge in favour of the Holding Company.
      We do not consider it an adequate defence of this practice    that the Subsidiary Company, standing on its own feet, would    not have been able to carry out such work  for less than  the    amount charged by the Holding Company  which includes  a    profit to that Company.  Although  we are  satisfied that  the    practice has not reached the dimensions of an abuse, we consider    it sufficient ground for criticism that  it deprives the Subsidiary    Company, and,  therefore, its customers, of the full benefits of    amalgamation which it  would receive if the Holding Company    recovered  from the Subsidiary Company only the actual costs    it incurs in giving such services ;  there is nothing to prevent the    practice from growing into an abuse.      (2) In some cases there exists within the group of Associated    Companies a separate contracting Company which performs the    same  services  for  the  operating Companies  as  those  just    described.   The contracting  Company (and equally the Holding    Company where it  acts as contractor) may also carry out work    for the customers of the operating Company (e.g., wiring, supply    and installation of  apparatus, etc.) which  the latter, if it were    independent, would have carried out itself.  The profit on such    work is thus diverted from the authorised undertaking, viz., the    Subsidiary Company.      (3)  The Holding Company, or a separate Company formed for    the purpose, undertakes the management  of the Subsidiary or    Associated operating Companies, for  which a management  fee    is charged to the operating Companies.   There would  be no    objection to this practice if, on the whole,  the charges made to    the Subsidiary or Associated Companies did not exceed the real    cost of management, but there is no control  over the practice,    and in some cases the charge borne by the  operating Companies    appears to be excessive.      (4)  In many cases a Holding Company makes advances to a    Subsidiary or Associated Company,  and the  interest on these    advances is   charged  against the profits of the  Subsidiary    Company.  We are satisfied that in  some cases the rate of    interest charged has been excessive. 293. There may be other  possibilities of abuse inherent in the holding Company system, such  as the transfer of an undertaking from one  Subsidiary Company to another at  an enhanced  value,which would thereafter  distort  the relationship between  profits and capital expenditure, but the above examples will suffice to showthat the  Holding  Company structure contains certain  possibilitiesof charges for electricity being maintained at an unnecessarily high level. 294. While, as already stated, the majority of Holding Companiesappear to be operating with due regard to the interests of consumers,and the above criticisms apply in whole or in part  only to a limited
number of Holding Company groups, we consider it most desirablethat such abuses should be rendered impossible.  295. We have heard criticism of the rates of dividend of Companyundertakings in relation to issued Share Capital.  There is a naturaldesire  on the part of  any Company to  avoid the charge of main-taining excessive  charges for electricity,  of which, prima facie,evidence might be found  in the payment of high rates of dividendson Ordinary Share Capital.  While it can scarcely be said  that therates of dividend paid by Companies engaged in the distribution ofelectricity  would,  on the average, afford grounds for this charge,there is a widespread belief that the rates of dividend paid, both by holding Companies (to the shareholding public) and by Subsidiaries(to  the Holding Companies)  are in many cases illusory,  for one orother of the following  reasons :        (1) The retention  in Subsidiary Companies,  in the  form of    reserves, excessive depreciation, etc., of profits which, although    not distributed, remain for the benefit  of the shareholders, and    which, if distributed, might invite comment on the high rate of    distribution.       (2) The supplementing of cash dividends by the  conferment    of capital bonuses in the form of free share issues, which transfers    to shareholders as Share Capital such retained profits in a less    obtrusive manner  than by the payment of large cash dividends,    and increases  the amount of  Share  Capital  issued,  with a    consequent  lowering effect on  the rate of dividend subsequently    paid.       (3) The issue to shareholders  of new shares  at a price sub-    stantially lower than  the current.market price.  These criticisms    illustrate the desirability of some form of control over the terms    of capital issues, to which we refer  elsewhere, as this question    is not peculiar to Holding Companies.  296. In several  of the  Holding  Company groups,  the  subsidiary companies owning and operating authorised undertakings are large in number.  We have heard  evidence from  several of these  HoldingCompanies to the effect that the continued separate existence of allthese Subsidiary Companies where  their  areas  are  contiguous, is undesirable, but that the statutory difficulties of physical amalgama-tion of these undertakings are considerable. The recommendations we  make elsewhere in this Report as to the machinery suggested for  carrying  through amalgamations will meet this difficulty.  Werecommend further  that  the Electricity Commissioners should begiven power to  require the amalgamation, in whole or in  part, ofthe Subsidiary Companies controlled by a Holding Company.  297. This provision should also apply to the amalgamation ofthe Holding  Company itself  with  its subsidiaries and to associated companies carrying on  a contracting  or  management  businesswhere  such amalgamation appears to be desirable.
  298. In cases where it is not practicable to merge the HoldingCompanies with  their Subsidiaries as  indicated in the  preceding paragraphs, we recommend that the  Accounts of such Companies,which own  the shares  of Companies operating  authorised under-takings, and of all associated contracting or management companies which may not be brought into such amalgamations, should be subjectto the same official audit as the authorised undertakers themselves.  299. There may still remain cases which would not be covered bythe above provisions and we recommend that,  where a local enquiry is held into the prices being charged by a subsidiary of a holding company, account should be taken of any profit made by the holding company in its dealings  with the Subsidiary  Company.   STANDARDISATION OF  SYSTEMS  AND VOLTAGES  300. The extent to which improvements can be effected with aview  to ensuring and expediting the standardisation of systems andpressures (voltages) of supply is a matter on which we have receiveda considerable amount of evidence.  301. So far as  standardisation of  frequency is  concerned, it is agreed that with certain minor exceptions,  this is  being rapidlycompleted under the  schemes  which have been adopted by theCentral Electricity Board in pursuance  of the Electricity (Supply)Act,  1926.  The  desirability of standardising frequency in the caseof such minor exceptions would no  doubt be dealt with by theDistrict Commissioners when preparing schemes of reorganisationfor the areas concerned.  302. The two principal points at issue therefore are :       (1) whether all  existing  direct  current supplies should be   changed over to alternating current, and      (2) whether it is practicable and desirable that all distribution   voltages should be standardised  on the basis recommended by   the  British Engineering Standards  Institution and advocated   by the Electricity  Commissioners,  namely, 230 volts, with its   equivalent of 400 volts applied to power.  303. On the first point, as previously indicated, statistics showthat  at the  end  of  the year 1933-34, 282 undertakings weresupplying alternating current only ;  283 were supplying both direct and alternating current;  and 77 were supplying direct current only.Complete standardisation of systems  would therefore affect no lessthan  360 separate undertakings.   Of these,  226 belong  to  public authorities and 134 to  Companies.   We understand that  a numberof these undertakings are in the transitional stage of changing over from direct to alternating current.
  304. We are informed that the total  number of direct  currentunits sold by all undertakings represents approximately 20 per cent.of the total units sold to consumers.  305. With regard to voltages of supply, during the same year there were as many as 43 different  declared voltages for  low and medium pressure supplies, ranging between 100 and 480 volts.  the table given in paragraph  (7) of Appendix II shows that in the caseof voltages up to 250,  there  were 263  undertakings supplyingalternating current and  208 undertakings supplying direct  currentat declared voltages which  differed  from the standard voltage of230.  Of these, 103 undertakings were supplying alternating current and  134  undertakings  were supplying direct current at voltages sonear the standard that,  having regard to the permissible variationallowed under the Regulations  of the Electricity Commissioners,standardisation should be a simple matter.  In considering the above figures, regard should be had to the fact that in a number of instancesindividual undertakings were supplying  at  two  or more differentvoltages.  306. We have noted  that under  Section 24 of the Electricity(Supply) Act,  1919, the Electricity Commissioners are empowered torequire  any authorised undertaker to  amend  or alter the  type of current, frequency or pressure (voltage) employed by them  in their undertaking.  Undertakers have  a right of appeal to the Minister ofTransport, and  the Minister, if satisfied that  compliance with therequirements  would entail unreasonable expense, can  direct  thatthey shall not apply or shall apply only subject to such conditionsas he may prescribe.  307. We are  informed that for various reasons this power has never been  formally exercised.   At  the same time we understandthat it has been the practice of the Electricity Commissioners to urge on undertakers the desirability of their changing  from directcurrent to alternating current  and  standardising  the voltage ofsupply wherever practicable.  308. The general  effect of the evidence we  have received fromthe various Associations representative of the Supply Authorities isthat complete standardisation is regarded as a desirable ideal.  Thechief deterrent is the  expenditure  involved in making the  change,including, inter alia, the cost of altering  apparatus on consumers&apos;premises to suit the new  system or voltage  of supply.   We areinformed that when consent is given to an alteration of system orvoltage,  it is  the general practice for  the  consenting authority to attach a condition that  the authorised undertaker shall bear thecost of changing consumers&apos; apparatus.  309. In the case of domestic consumers, the cost of changing overradio receivers  alone would represent,  we understand,  a  heavyaggregate cost to the undertakers.
  310.  With regard to the change from direct current to alternating current, evidence shows  that the advantages of such a change are generally appreciated by the Associations representing the Supply Authorities, particularly  from the point of view of enabling them to cope more  effectively with any expansion of demand.  311.  When extensions of mains are required, it is undesirable to incur  expenditure on what is in effect an out-of-date system. Furthermore, direct  current converting  plant  costs  considerably more than  static transforming plant;  it  needs more attention and involves more repairs and maintenance, and  the distribution losses are greater.  It appears to be the general practice not to extend existing direct  current systems  and to change  them gradually  as and when opportunity occurs.  312.  In densely populated  industrial  or  commercial areas the change involves a  heavy  burden  of  expenditure, particularly  in respect of lifts  and motors for driving machinery.  A further  con- sideration  to  be  taken  into   account  is  the  undesirability  of prematurely scrapping serviceable plant.  313.  Furthermore, in large towns where electricity is supplied  to public  buildings,  theatres, cinemas,  etc., continuity of supply  is frequently  a  definite  requirement,  and  a  direct  current  system utilised in  conjunction  with  storage  batteries secures  an  added degree  of reliability.  314.  Evidence  shows, nevertheless, that  the ultimate  change from direct to alternating current is recognised as  being desirable. In many cases, even in cities and industrial areas, the change is already being made, though on  account  of the  cost it is  the more usual practice to spread it over a period of years.   We note that itis the practice of certain undertakings, more particularly the larger, to set aside a  sum annually out of revenue to defray this cost.  315.  In all the circumstances,  while we endorse  the desirabilityof the change from direct to alternating current being carried out as quickly as  possible, we  do not  feel  justified in recommending acomplete  and immediate change on a compulsory basis. We are  ofopinion, however, that it would  not be unreasonable for a schemeto provide that a reorganised undertaking should in fact carry out such change on the basis of a definite  programme spread over someprescribed period.  316.  With  regard to  standardisation of  voltage,  a  number  ofAssociations have expressed the view that this is necessary in orderto cheapen distribution costs ; to permit  of interchange of suppliesbetween  adjacent  areas  ;  and to  reduce the cost of lamps  andapparatus to consumers, particularly those  who  move from onedistrict to another.  The latter point  has been emphasised by the consumers&apos; Organisations which  have appeared before us.   OtherAssociations and witnesses have,  on the other hand,  expressed the
view that there is a tendency to over-emphasise the advantages tobe derived from such standardisation.  317. As  affecting  the cost of manufacture it must be  borne inmind that even if voltages were completely standardised  in GreatBritain, it would still be necessary for manufacturers to make lampsand other apparatus of non-standard voltage for purposes of export  318. It has been  generally agreed that in regard to the change from  220 volts to  230  volts, which could  be effected  within thelimits of the variation  allowed by  the  Regulations, there would bedefinite advantage  to the undertakers by reason  of the increasedcarrying capacity  of the mains  which  would result  therefrom.This would tend to offset the expenditure  involved in the changeover.  On the other hand, in the case of a change over from a voltagehigher than 230, the  carrying capacity  of the  mains would bereduced, and there would be no offset to the expenditure involved,  319. We are informed that in 1930, certain estimates  were madeof the cost of  standardising voltages throughout  the country, andthat  it  was estimated that the  cost of  standardising  voltages(a)  below 220,  might range  from  10  million  to   16 million, and(b) above 240, would be about 10 per cent,  of these  amounts.  while there has  been considerable  development  since  these  estimates were prepared, it is possible that the cost would not be substantially higher to-day,  since, during the intervening period, several systemshave  been completely or partly standardised and a limitation hasbeen kept  upon the extension of non-standard systems.  320. It has been suggested that in many cases the cost of changingwould be so great as to be beyond the resources  of the individualundertakers, and that if  complete  standardisation  were  to beembarked upon it would either be necessary to spread the cost overthe whole industry in the form of a levy or to provide some form ofGovernment assistance.  We are  not prepared to recommend theadoption of either of these alternatives.  321. We are  of opinion that having regard to  the annual levywhich is already being made to  cover the cost of standardisation offrequency, it would  neither be reasonable nor desirable to impose afurther levy on the industry to cover the cost of standardisation ofvoltage,  especially as many undertakings have already completedstandardisation or are in process of doing so at their own cost.  322. After a careful review of the position we do not feel justifiedin recommending  complete  and   immediate standardisation  ofvoltages.  323. This is  a matter which must be taken into account by theDistrict Commissioners with  a view to securing where possible thatin the area of each reorganised undertaking standardisation of voltageshould be completed within a prescribed period.
  324.  The general standardisation of both systems and  voltageswill be expedited by the reorganisation of the Industry which wehave recommended.     STANDARDISATION OF METHODS OF CHARGE  325.  The charges for electricity affect intimately all consumers ofelectricity in Great Britain.  The present numerous variations inthe methods of charge in different areas justify public criticism andare one of the most pressing matters which call for reform.  326.  Some degree of standardisation of methods of charge is clearlyan essential preliminary to any progress towards greater uniformity in actual charges and this has been agreed in principle by the variousSupply Associations which have appeared before us.  327.  The extraordinary number of tariffs and variations in methodsof charge arise largely from the multiplicity of undertakings ;  andthe wide  differences of  opinion prevailing among   the  supply authorities as to the best method of charge to adopt.  328.  All  progressive  Supply  Undertakings  recognise that  anysubstantial expansion of demand particularly for domestic and shopand office  supplies can  only be secured by offering to consumerswhat is known as an &quot; all-in &quot; or a two-part tariff.  329.  The most common  type of two-part tariff consists of :        (a)  a fixed  quarterly  or  annual charge which is based  on    some defined factor (e.g., floor area, number  of rooms, rateable    value,  maximum demand)  and is payable irrespective  of  the    number  of  units consumed,  being  similar  in  nature to  the    quarterly fixed charge in the Telephone Service ;  and       (b)  a low running or unit charge payable  in respect of each    unit actually consumed and equivalent to the call rate  in  the    Telephone service.  330.  A tariff of this nature is intended to  encourage consumers tomake an extended use  of  the  supply, since after payment  of  the fixed charge all units (whether used for lighting, heating, cooking orany other purpose) can be obtained at the low unit rate.  The greater the consumption of any particular consumer the lower is the average price per unit.  331.  The  reorganisation of the present numerous undertakingsinto a smaller number of larger and more economic units must be animportant first step towards securing greater uniformity of methodsof charge throughout the country. It should be a definite objective of the  consolidated undertakings thereafter to bring about an earlyunification of  methods of charge throughout their respective areasof supply even though uniformity of the actual charges may  not be immediately practicable.
   332.  Some  amendment  of  the existing legislative provisions appears to be necessary to  enable this result to be attained without delay.   For  instance, there is now no provision which requires an authorised distributor to offer a two-part tariff for domestic supplies, etc.,  as  an  alternative to a flat rate charge.   The authorised dis- distributors if they so decide may restrict their tariff to a flat rate only, We recommend therefore that the Minister of Transport should be empowered to require all authorised distributors to make  available to their consumers  an approved  statutory two-part  tariff as an optional alternative to a flat rate.   333. We do not think there is  at  present  any  one satisfactory uniform basis  of two-part  tariff for domestic  supplies which could reasonably be  imposed compulsorily on  all undertakers.   334. We  are  aware  that a  previous  Committee,  which  was appointed by the Electricity Commissioners to report  on the possi- bility of effecting a greater measure of uniformity of tariffs, recom- mended  for domestic supplies a two-part tariff,  the fixed charge of which should  be based on the size  of  house  (floor  area).  That Committee, however, indicated that they were  unable to point to any basis as being wholly  without defects of some kind,  but  that less objection  attached  to  the  floor area  basis  than to any other form of tariff.   335. We have also noted that there are many large undertakings which have adopted the size of house (floor area) as the basis for the fixed charge under  their  domestic two-part  tariff.  Among local authority undertakings, however, there appear to be a substantial number  which prefer to adopt rateable value as the basis  of fixed charge.   336. We have come to the conclusion that while the adoption of a domestic two-part tariff, the fixed charge of which is based on floor area, might well be the ultimate objective, there are not sufficient grounds  at  the present time for recommending legislation which would have the effect of making it obligatory on all undertakings to adopt that form.   337. A substantial  step towards greater uniformity would be taken if  the two-part tariff which all undertakers should be required to offer, were based either on (1) size of house (floor area) or (2) rateable value, unless the undertakers could satisfy the Minister that some other basis of &quot; all-in &quot; or two-part tariff is justified by the special circumstances obtaining in their area.   338. With regard to ordinary supplies for shops and office purposes,the recommendation  of the Tariffs Committee  above  referred to,namely, that the fixed charge under a two-part tariff should be basedon the lighting wattage of the installation, appears to have been widely adopted.
  339.  The supply of electricity to the  large retail  departmentalstores raises points of difficulty  which, in our opinion,  appear torequire  special  consideration  by  the  Industry.  The  evidenceindicates that there are wide differences in the bases on which such large retail stores are  being charged for their electricity in the sameand in  different towns throughout the country.   The need has been emphasised for supply authorities generally to  offer, on a  moreuniform basis, a tariff  which contains a promotional element therebyencouraging the stores to make a fuller use of the supply.  340.  In addition to the views expressed by Associations  repre-sentative of the retail Distributors, evidence to the same effect hasalso been given by Associations representing other important groups of consumers throughout the country.   In particular, it has beensuggested that supplies for cinemas and  for photographic purposeshave certain characteristics which justify special consideration, andthat  there should be  greater uniformity  in the  methods of chargeoffered by the various Supply Authorities  for such supplies.  341.  We do not consider that it is within the scope of our investiga-tion to inquire into or to make recommendations as to what particular form of tariff is best suited for every special class of supply.  In viewof the increasing number of purposes for which electricity can be usedit is obviously essential that Supply Undertakings should be allowedconsiderable flexibility in quoting special rates for special classes ofsupply.   Any restrictive action in this direction could only have adetrimental effect on  the proper  development of an undertaking.  342.  Where, however, throughout the  country there are special classes having similar technical characteristics and in respect of which,therefore, it should be possible to devise  a uniform basis of charge,the Associations representative of the Supply Authorities could with advantage  confer  with the  Associations representing such special classes  of user.  Such consultation  should go a long way towardssecuring  greater uniformity in the basis of charge applied by  thedifferent authorities.  343.  We note that this course has  already been  adopted with considerable success in the case of supplies of electricity for industrial purposes, and that, as a result of conferences between the Federationof British Industries  and the Supply  Associations, a considerable measure of agreement has been reached as to what can be regardedas a  reasonable and appropriate  basis of  tariff.  344.  Apart from any action which the Associations representing theSupply Authorities may be able to  take, we are of opinion that aconsiderable measure of uniformity  could  be  obtained by localconsultations between the undertakers themselves in  various areas.The  Advisory Committee representative  of authorised undertakersin each reorganised area would be a valuable medium not only for
discussion between the undertakers themselves, but also between theundertakers and representative groups of consumers.  345. The relation of a flat rate charge to a two-part tariff is another matter which  has been brought  prominently to our  notice.  Itwould seem that in some cases it is the policy to reduce the lightingflat rate to a low  level  in preference to making  reductions in thealternative two-part tariff.  We are informed that in some cases the lighting flat rate is as low as l^d. per unit, which, unless confined toexceptional cases of long hour user, appears to be an uneconomic rate.In other cases it appears to be the policy to  keep the lighting flat rate at a higher level and to concentrate  on reducing as much aspossible the charges under a two-part tariff.  346. Certain consumers&apos; organisations whom we have heard attach great importance to the  reduction of the lighting flat rate, and itwould seem that it is the difference between the lighting flat rates ofdifferent areas  which is  one of the principal  grounds of complaint to-day.  We feel that the importance of such differences can be overemphasised, and that it may well be that in certain areas the presentlighting flat rate is, in fact, too low.  347. We have received a considerable amount of evidence to theeffect that an attractive two-part tariff is, particularly in the case of domestic  supplies,  the most  effective  means of  bringing about a substantially extended use of the supply, and is, therefore, one of theprincipal  factors in reducing  distribution costs, and  in  facilitatingfurther reductions in charges to all classes.  348. In the case of consumers whose use of electricity for lightingpurposes is very small and who would obtain no advantage, on  theirexisting consumption,  in changing over to  the two-part tariff, thestanding charges alone involved in providing and rhaintaining thesupply are such that a comparatively high flat rate is justified, apartfrom  the  fact that the  demand for such  limited supplies usuallyoccurs during the peak load period.  349. It has also been submitted that the reduction of the lightingflat rate to an unduly low level makes  it more difficult to persuadeconsumers to change over to a two-part tariff even when such a tariffis offered on an attractive basis.  350. This point is borne out by evidence relating to two authorities of comparable size  and circumstances, both  of whom offered a  two-part tariff as an optional alternative to a flat rate charge.   While theaverage revenue per unit  sold was the same in both cases, the unitssold per consumer were 30 per cent, higher in the case of the authority which  had the higher lighting flat  rate, due to the more extensiveadoption of the two-part  tariff.  The existence of a very low lightingflat rate in the case of the other undertaking militated against themore  widespread adoption of the two-part tariff.
  351. We are satisfied that it is more important to concentrate onoffering a satisfactory two-part tariff, and that for the reasons stated above the reduction of the lighting flat rate to an unduly low level isto be deprecated.  352. Well planned publicity can  do much  to  make consumersrealise the advantages of a two-part tariff, not only in enabling eachconsumer to use electricity for cooking, heating and other domestic purposes at a low unit charge, but also in bringing home to consumersgenerally that an increase in the total sales should lead to a reductionin prices.  353. It is of importance that all undertakers should be required to publish the actual scale of fixed charges in their two-part tariff.  Notto do this is bound to give rise to mistrust on the part of individualconsumers who may have doubt whether in their particular case the fixed charge has been fairly applied to them.  354. It is not practicable to specify any general level to which the unit charge under a two-part tariff should be reduced.  It has beensuggested, and  we agree, that a unit charge  of \d. is sufficientlyadvantageous to the consumer to encourage the use of electricity forpractically all domestic purposes.  355. Many undertakings are now offering a two-part tariff with  a unit charge of \d., or even less.  We recognise that in some  cases solow a rate may not be immediately practicable, especially in the rural areas  and  during the  early  stages of development.  It  should,however, be an objective to be attained.  FURTHER EXTENSION OF  FACILITIES  (INCLUDING              SUPPLIES  IN  RURAL AREAS)  356.  The reorganisation we have recommended should result in aconsiderable expansion of the facilities  available to  consumers and prospective consumers throughout Great Britain both from the pointof view of extensions of mains in streets and to areas  where a supply is not yet available.  An extended use of electricity should follow from a more general application  of  an attractive  two-part  tariff,favourable schemes for the hire or hire-purchase of apparatus and assisted wiring, provision of adequate showrooms, and good service to consumers.  357.  Evidence has shown that the extent to which these facilities are  offered varies widely between different undertakings.   Manyauthorised distributors have  laid distributing mains throughout allthe  streets within their area ; have made available all the facilitiesreferred to above ;  and by intensive  publicity have achieved  a remarkable measure of success even in the poorer areas.
  358. On the other hand, there are many undertakings, including some of the larger, which have not yet laid distributing mains inconsiderable lengths of streets  even in urban areas and who onlyprovide the requisite facilities to a limited extent.  359. We are informed that at the end of 1934, in urban areas alone,there were some 8,000 miles of streets in which distributing mainshad not  then been laid, representing approximately one-fifth of thetotal mileage of streets in such areas ;  that out of 625 undertakings,of which particulars were available, 153, including even certain large towns, had no showrooms, and that many of the larger undertakingsonly have one showroom in their extensive area ; that  265 out of625 undertakings had no canvassing system at all ;  and that over20 per cent,  of the undertakings had no scheme of assisted wiring,which is essential if the smaller dwellings are to be connected in any considerable  number.  360. The lack  of such facilities is, in our opinion, reflected in thefigures of load factor and sales  per head of population for the year1933-34, which show that no less than 271 out of 635 undertakingsthen had a load factor of less than 25 per cent., and that 299 out of603 undertakings, including many undertakings which have had acomparatively long franchise, were selling less than 100 units per headof population.  361. In so far as mains have not yet been laid in urban areas, we appreciate that in many  cases  the streets may  not  yet  have been built up.  There would be no object in such cases in requiring theundertakers to lay mains in these streets until circumstances change and a demand arises.  In  other  cases the  streets  serve  factorypremises or  warehouses where low voltage mains are not required.  362. Even when such considerations  are taken into account there remains, we  understand, a considerable mileage of built-up streetswhere no mains have been laid.  363. The two principal reasons for this appear to be :       (1) That a supply of gas is already available.      (2) That the property is alleged to be of too small a type to be    supplied on an economic basis.  364.  The fact that in the case of certain undertakings electricitymains are not laid in a street where a gas supply is already availableappears to show  a lack of enterprise on the part of  the  authorisedundertakers   concerned.  It has been suggested that this may  beindicative of  the retarding  effect  on the full  development of anelectricity undertaking when under the control of an  Authorityadministering both the gas and electricity supplies.
  365. The excuse that the type of property is so small that a supplycould not be afforded on an economic basis shows a lack of apprecia-tion  of what can be and is being achieved  by offering the fullestfacilities in conjunction with intensive publicity.  366. Cases have been brought  to our notice where undertakingswhose areas contain a substantial proportion of small properties have laid mains  in every street and have  found by  experience that by offering suitable facilities, including a tariff which incorporates any necessary hire or hire-purchase charges,  a remunerative  demand canbe built up.  Even  in the smallest type of premises consumers canbe encouraged to instal and use cookers and other apparatus.  367. In the case of consumers earning a comparatively low weeklywage, evidence shows that an increased  consumption is encouragedwhere two-part tariff prepayment meters are  installed.   It has been pointed out that the cost of such meters is high compared with thecost of ordinary meters.  A substantial  increase in their use should,however, result in a material reduction in their cost.  368. Another point  has been  made  that the supply  to smallproperties could be  more readily given  if undertakers could obtainauthority to run their cables  underneath the eaves of  the houses.We are informed that this can be done without involving any danger to the public or damage to the property.  We  recommend that inappropriate cases undertakers should  be granted the necessary powers to adopt this form of construction, for which, we understand,there  are precedents.  369. It should not in urban areas  be  necessary to  invoke therequisition  provisions  of the  Schedule  to  the Electric  Lighting(Clauses) Act, 1899,  before extensions of  mains are carried out.  Anybuilt-up street should yield sufficient revenue and a reasonable return on the capital expenditure if mains are laid in advance of  demand and full facilities are offered, accompanied by judicious publicity.  370. We  are of opinion, therefore, that except in cases where thereare no buildings along a street, or where, as in the case of the larger-factories, supplies can be given by high voltage  mains,  it should becompetent  for  a scheme to provide that low  voltage  distributingmains should be laid in all streets in urban areas within  a prescribed period.  371. It has also been brought to our notice that in certain areas themains originally laid are inadequate in size to deal with the demand,such as for full domestic supplies, which would arise if proper facilities were made available.  It has been suggested that in such cases someof the undertakers are reluctant to afford these facilities because ofthe additional expenditure on mains  which would be necessary tomeet  this  increased demand.  The reorganisation  of   the  under-takings into units of economic size with  adequate financial resources should result in this  position being remedied in course of  time.
                SUPPLIES IN RURAL  AREAS   372. Figures have been submitted which show that out of the totalarea (urban and rural) of Great Britain, namely, 88,137 square miles,the areas covered by electricity  supply powers at the end of 1934-35amounted to about 76,030 square miles, or over 86 per cent., and thatthese  areas  of supply  included  a  population  of 44*44 millioninhabitants out of a total of 44 - 79 million, or over 99 per cent.  Thegreater part of the area which is not at present covered by electricity supply powers is situate in the mountainous and sparsely populateddistricts  in the north and north-west of Scotland.   373. The above figures do not imply that a  supply of electricityis available throughout the whole  of the areas in respect of whichsupply powers have been granted.  We have received a considerableamount of evidence, both general and specific, to the contrary.   374. In many cases representations have been made regarding thedelay  on the part  of  Supply Authorities in extending supplies to various parts of their rural areas and of the high cost quoted by suchAuthorities for carrying out new extensions.   375. Such  representations are, in our opinion, an indication of thedifficulties encountered in the development of a rural area ; and notnecessarily of default on the part of the Supply Authorities.   376. As already emphasised in this Report, the fact that in most cases  the urban areas have been developed first, leaving the rural areas  to be developed separately, has made the development of rural areas  more difficult, particularly  having regard to their low density of population ;  the isolated position of many premises ;  the  longermains required to make a supply available ; and the smaller spending power of agricultural  workers.   These difficulties,  inherent  in thedevelopment of electricity supply  in rural  areas,  are  to a certain extent counterbalanced by the cheaper form of construction whichcan frequently be  adopted,  such as the provision of overhead linesinstead of underground cables.   377. A supply of electricity brings to workers in rural areas manyof the amenities of the urban areas.  It has also been suggested thata supply of electricity will play an important part not only in revivingthe rural industries which in the past have been a prominent feature of many  village communities, but also  in the establishment of new industries for which electric power is eminently suitable.   378. In the case of farms the evidence shows that a supply ofelectricity enables more  efficient results to be obtained at cheapercost.   The instances cited where farmers have used electricity in and around the farm and  homestead have clearly proved the benefit ofsuch a supply.            .......
   379. Farmers and rural dwellers generally are inclined to adopt a conservative attitude towards the  utilisation of these advantages, and in many cases considerable preliminary work of an educational character is necessary to create a demand which would justify the expenditure required to make a supply available.  Nevertheless, we have had evidence  to show that in all  parts of the country the advantages of electricity are being increasingly appreciated, and that in many areas which are at present without a supply the residents are impatient at the delay in obtaining it, particularly when the grid lines of the Central Electricity Board pass in close proximity or when they see the supply brought to other villages.  380. It would appear that in many cases it is not appreciated that it is the function of the grid to supply electricity in bulk at very high voltages to the Supply Authorities.  These in turn have to provide their own systems of secondary transmission lines, sub-stations and transformers and low voltage  mains in  order  to make the supply available to their consumers.   It is not economically practicable to tap the grid lines for the purposes of small local supplies.  381. There is scope for a much wider and more intensive electrical development of rural areas, though we  consider that the progress which has already been made  in some rural areas is  encouraging.  382. As an indication of the progress which has been made  in recent  years we may record that some 9,300 miles  of low voltage distributing  mains have been  provided  in rural areas during the five years ending 31st March,  1934.  383.  We have noted with interest the results of  the Rural Demon- stration Schemes which have been carried out  by the Corporations of Bedford and Norwich.  These had as their objective the com- prehensive and rapid electrification  of typical  rural areas,  so  that within a period of about two years supplies for all purposes would be within the reach of practically all the inhabitants of those areas.  384.  It was recognised that  the carrying out of these schemes on an intensive basis within a limited period would involve a deficit  in the earlier years.  Provision was made for limited financial assistance from the Development Commissioners in the case of the Bedford Scheme and  from the  Unemployment Grants Committee in thecase  of the Norwich  Scheme.  Neither of these Schemes is yet  self-supporting, though we are informed there is reasonable expectation that they will become so in time.  385.  The rural areas in which supplies of electricity are not yet available fall into two main categories :       (1) Those areas in which it may be anticipated that a supply  .  can be  provided under a  comprehensive scheme and while    perhaps not immediately remunerative, would show an economic    return in the course of a few years,
       (2) Those areas  in  which, owing  to  their  geographical    situation combined with an extremely low density of population    it is unlikely that a supply can be given economically, except    perhaps with some form of subsidy.  386. It has been suggested  in evidence that it would be in thenational interest that a supply of electricity should be made availableto all premises in rural areas irrespective of their situation, and thatthis could be effected by a pooling  of costs and revenues either on a district or a national basis.  Also, that in order to supply the moresparsely populated and remoter rural areas referred to in paragraph (2)above, further demonstration schemes  should be  prepared for such areas analogous to those of Bedford and Norwich.  387. We  attach great importance to our recommendation thatrural areas should as far as practicable be grouped with urban areas.This policy will facilitate the  carrying out  of comprehensive  ruralschemes and should  enable development to be  achieved  withoutimposing an undue burden on  the urban area.  388. The evidence shows that where in certain cases rural  areas have already been developed in conjunction with urban areas, theorganisation for the urban area has been extended at a comparativelylow increase of cost to deal with the development of the added ruralarea.  389. Several instances of urban undertakings which have developedconsiderable rural tracts adjacent to the principal undertaking havebeen brought to our notice.  It has  been proved either that the ruralarea has been developed in stages  with no financial burden to the urban  nucleus, or that the deficit has been  so insignificant that no practical effect has been felt by the urban consumers.  390. There are some general considerations which apply to  rural development to which we must refer.  391. The main difficulty is the heavy cost of high  voltage mains,transformers and low voltage mains in relation to the low density ofthe population to be served and resulting low revenue.  392. In certain cases, we are told,  supply authorities have notbeen able to extend to more remote villages because their originalmains  were not  of adequate capacity and  the  additional cost ofenlarging  such   mains  would make  the  extension   prohibitive.A considerable part of this additional cost would have been saved ifmains  of adequate capacity had been  installed in the first instancewith a comparatively small  increased cost at the time.  393. In order to obtain  the  maximum  number of  consumers andthe fullest use of the supply in the shortest possible period an activeselling policy and the right type of  tariff are essential.  In addition,full and attractive facilities  should be made available for the hire
 or hire-purchase of apparatus and for the assisted wiring of premises. It would also seem desirable that schemes for the hire purchase of the electrical machinery and apparatus required on farms should be introduced more generally.  394. The framing of appropriate  tariffs to be  charged in rural areas involves some  difficulty.   We have considered whether  for rural areas which are  amalgamated with urban  areas, it would be reasonable to recommend uniform rates  of charge throughout  the whole of a particular area.  We have come to the conclusion, however, that in many cases this would not be practicable in the early stages and  that  for  a certain  period  some zoning of  charges would be necessary.  It should,  however,  be the ultimate objective to  obtain such  uniformity  where  economically justified  and  the improved organisation should facilitate its realisation.  395. Suitable two-part or all-in tariffs are essential in our opinion if the best  results  are to be obtained.  So far as domestic premises are concerned, the tariff  recommended by the Tariffs Committee, previously  referred to, namely,  a two-part tariff,  the  fixed charge of which is based on the size of the house (floor  area) appears to have been widely adopted in many rural areas and seems a suitable form of  tariff for wider application.  396. For supplies to  farms,  however,  particularly where out- buildings are involved, the floor area tariff would appear to require some  modification.  We understand  that  this particular aspect is being explored by a Sub-Committee of the Rural Conference,  which is convened from time to  time by the Electricity Commissioners.  397. Another  general  matter  which  has  been referred  to  in evidence is  the amount of revenue which supply authorities require to be guaranteed before they will incur expenditure  on extensions of their mains.  398. The  normal  basis  of  guarantee  provided for under  the Schedule to the Electric Lighting (Clauses) Act, 1899, is that  six or more consumers can demand a supply, provided they will guarantee for a period a gross revenue of 20 per cent, on the capital expenditure involved in providing such supply.  399. In the case of individual premises, an owner or occupier candemand  a supply  if his premises are situate within 50 yards of adistributing main, but he can be required to pay the cost of so much,of the service line as is situate on his own property and of so muchoutside that property as is in excess  of 60  feet, in addition to theguarantee  referred to above.  There are  apparently  no provisionsunder which individual consumers, whose  premises are more than50 yards from a distributing main, can compel the undertakers  togive a supply.
  400. As indicated above,  we are of opinion that in the case of urban and built-up areas, it should  not be  necessary  for  supply authorities to  invoke  such requisition provisions as a preliminarycondition to an extension of mains except in special cases.  It shouldbe  possible in  most cases  to  secure an adequate return on  theexpenditure without resort to guarantees.  401. Some form of guarantee is,  however, clearly necessary inthe case of extensions in rural areas, and in our opinion the presentrequisition provisions of the  Clauses Act are not altogether suitable.  402. Certain  supply authorities have indicated  that  they stillconsider it necessary to require a guarantee of the full 20 per cent.before agreeing to carry out  an extension.  Other supply authoritiesserving large rural areas successfully have indicated that they areprepared to carry out extensions on the basis of a lower percentagereturn than 20 per cent.  403. Whether  a guarantee of revenue of  20 per cent, or somelower figure is reasonable must depend on the  particular  circum-stances.   We  do  not  feel justified in recommending any generaldeparture from the 20 per cent, basis laid down by the Schedule tothe Electric Lighting (Clauses)  Act,  1899.  It would not, however,be unreasonable to empower the Electricity  Commissioners to pre-scribe some lower percentage of guarantee in particular cases wherethey are satisfied that  the circumstances justify it.  404. The conditions on which Supply Authorities are prepared toextend  their mains to supply  individual and isolated consumers,apparently vary in practice,  the three main alternatives being :        (a) to require the consumer to bear the whole or part of the    capital cost of the extension ;       (b) to  require  the consumer  to guarantee a revenue  of    20 per cent, on the capital cost involved for a substantial period    of years ;  and       (c) to require a combination of  (a) and (&amp;).  405. Alternative (b)  is of course open to the objection that if  thepremises become  vacant  the supply  authorities  may  be left withexpenditure on which they have no revenue.  406. We have had evidence to show that where a supply is given on a guarantee alone the prospective consumer can usually be shownthat he can with advantage  use electricity of such an  amount thatits value will at least be equivalent to the amount of ;the guarantee,  407. We are of  opinion that a reasonable combination of (a) and(6)  may  be found to be  in  the best  interests of both the supplyauthority and the consumer.
  408.  Where a main has been extended to supply one consumer,who has been required to contribute towards the capital cost of theextension, and  other consumers have subsequently been connectedto the  same  main, it is unreasonable  that  the original consumershould  bear the sole liability for the capital contribution.   We areof opinion that provision  should be  made whereby the  originalconsumer  should be entitled to  some proportionate refund of hiscapital contribution if  other consumers are,  within a period ofthree years, supplied through the same main.  409.  While we emphasise that it is the duty of Supply authorities themselves to endeavour to create a demand which will justify thecost of providing a supply by  adopting the  most progressive com-mercial methods, Local  Authorities and prospective consumers  can also facilitate the extension of supplies to their Districts.  410.  Local Authorities, for instance, should consider the utilisationwherever possible of electricity supplies for water pumping and forstreet lighting.   Groups of residents can do much by joint action and collectively they may be able to guarantee an adequate revenue.  411.  We suggest that Supply Authorities should work in the closestcollaboration,  not only with the Parish  Councils  and the  LocalAuthorities within their area, but also with such other local bodiesas Women&apos;s  Institutes  and Rural Community  Councils.   Thiscollaboration  should facilitate  the grant of  wayleaves and should help to remove opposition  on the part of  Local Authorities to theerection of overhead lines.   Supply Authorities, by keeping fully intouch  with such  bodies  would help  the  Local Authorities  andAssociations  to realise  more readily  the  advantages which mustaccrue  to  their districts when this public utility is  placed at their service.  412.  Where  the  amount of  revenue to  be obtained  from  anextension is not sufficient to show an economic return, we have cometo the  conclusion that there might in certain cases be grounds forauthorising the Local Authority concerned to associate  themselves with a guarantee of revenue to  bring it up to a reasonable level.For  this  purpose they should, if called upon  to  implement  suchguarantee, be entitled to charge it to the rates of the particular areaconcerned.  413.  Several Associations have drawn our attention to the powersof the  Minister of  Transport under Section 22 of the Electricity(Supply)  Act, 1919, as  affected  by  the judgment of the  Court in what is known as the Pitt  case.  As a result of this judgment theMinister when granting compulsory wayleaves is not empowered to fix the wayleave rentals.  This has increased the difficulties of supply authorities, who are reluctant to apply to the Minister for compulsorywayleaves, since it is difficult  to foretell what compensation they.may have to pay if the  wayleave is granted.  We  recommend.
 therefore, that the Section should be amended to give effect to what was understood to be its original intention, namely, that the Minister of  Transport when granting compulsory wayleaves  should also by statute be enabled to fix the wayleave rentals.   414. With regard to the general  extension of facilities in both urban and  rural areas, it is not enough that such facilities should be made available.  Consumers must be encouraged  to adopt them. To this  end Supply Authorities must employ efficient and specially trained  personnel and must be  prepared to carry out intensive canvassing  and  demonstrating, backed up  by well  thought out educational advertisement.   415. We  are of opinion that  the activities of such bodies as the British  Electrical  Development  Association and  the   Electrical Association for Women are deserving of the fullest support.  Under present conditions the activities of the former body must necessarily be governed by the amount of financial support which they receive from Supply Authorities and this, having regard to the gross revenue of such Authorities, can only be described as meagre.  416. In order to gain and retain the goodwill of the public, Supply Authorities must  maintain an adequate and efficient  staff for the expeditious servicing  of  small  repairs  and for  dealing  fully and promptly with complaints from consumers.  The  more the public realise the advantages which a supply of electricity can confer, the higher will be the standard of service which they will require from the Supply Authorities.                    REDUCTIONS IN  COSTS  417. The reduction of the cost of electricity to  the   consumer and the wider availability of supply must be the primary  objectives of any scheme of improvement.  Our recommendations have  beenmade with these ends in view.  418. The  statistics given in Table 1 of Appendix II show that, taking the country  as a whole,  the average cost of generation has fallen over the last 10 years from 0 - 9675^. per unit sold in 1924-25 to0-5231a!.  in  1933-34, representing a reduction of  46 per cent,  in what may be termed the wholesale cost.  419. Further reductions in the cost of generation will no doubt bemade,  but it must be obvious that each successive step in improvedtechnical efficiency reduces  the  possibility of further reductions in cost and approaches a practical  limit.  420. Table  1 of Appendix II shows that during the last 10 yearsthat part of the  cost of electrical energy attributable to local dis-tribution rose from 0-7573d. per unit sold in 1924-25  to 0-8278^. in 1931-32.  There  was some  slight  reduction in the two succeeding
22years, but the cost in 1933-34 at 0 - 7664^. per unit sold was higherthan the cost in 1924-25.  It has been suggested in evidence that themaintenance of the level of distribution costs as compared with thefall in generation costs has been largely attributable to the connectionin increasing numbers year by  year of  the smaller premises withcorrespondingly  lower  sales ;  to expenditure incurred in  changingover systems of supply which has not yet been fully written off ;and to the development of the more sparsely populated rural areas where the number of consumers and the consumption of electricityis low in relation to the capital expenditure incurred.  421. The  distribution  costs as shown in the Table have  been criticised by one  Association on the grounds that  they include certain items of expenditure which have been incurred in connection,inter alia, with the taking of bulk supplies from the Central electricity board and that certain of these  items ought properly to be debitedagainst  generation  costs.  We  do not, however, think  that  thefigures in the Table would be materially affected, and the fact remainsthat the average cost of distribution per unit sold has been practicallyconstant during the last 10 years.  422. Further reductions in cost  are  therefore possible in twodirections, namely (a) to a limited extent in the cost of generation ;and (b)  more particularly from greater sales of electricity  resulting in a fuller use of the capital invested in distribution systems.  423. Where Supply  Authorities purchase their energy in  bulkunder a two-part tariff, the fixed charge of which is normally basedon maximum demand,  a reduction in the average cost of electricitycan be realised by such authorities making  every effort to secure themaximum diversity  of load  in  their area, thereby increasing the load factor ;  that is to say, by increasing the number of units soldper kilowatt of maximum demand which,  mutatis mutandis,  results in a lower average cost per unit.  The regrouping of  undertakings and the  elimination of duplicate powers which we have recommendedshould bring  about  a considerable improvement in the diversity ofload in the reorganised areas.  424. Care will have to be exercised when approving schemes forthe  improvement of distribution  to  ensure that  the  revenues  ofthe  Central  Electricity  Board  during  their  existing budgetaryperiods will not be adversely affected.  425. On the distribution side of the Industry a reduction in theaverage cost  per unit  must,  as  we have said, be looked  for in  agreater  sale of units in relation to capital invested.   It has been pointed  out to us that  a marked improvement in the load  factor ofany authorised  distributors undertaking  can  be brought  about by the more widespread use of domestic apparatus, such as cookersand water heaters.
  426. Our attention has been drawn to the effect of using apparatusof a thermal storage type for which electricity can be supplied at a low cost during what are known as &apos;&apos; off-peak&apos;&apos; hours, by the adoptionof an alternative system  of mains not dependent on constant voltagesupplies.  We are not prepared to express an opinion as to the extentto which such technical developments of this nature can produce the results which are claimed for them.  The question as to whetherthe adoption of  any particular change in existing technical practiceis justified on merits is obviously a matter for the operating supply authorities.  427. It will be noted from Table  1 that capital charges compriseapproximately 50 per cent, of the total distribution costs.  Evidencehas  been given  to the effect that on the average a reduction of1 per cent, in the capital charges is equivalent to a 6  per  cent.reduction of the gross revenue.  It is  important, therefore, that(a)  new  capital  should be raised on the best possible terms, and.(b) existing and  future capital expenditure should be utilised to thefullest possible advantage.  428. On the former point the evidence shows that  in the pastCompanies, for  various reasons to which we have referred earlier in this Report,  have not been able to raise capital on such advan-tageous  terms  as  local authorities.  To-day,  however,  it wouldappear that well established companies are able to raise their capitalon terms which are only slightly less favourable than those on whichcapital can be raised by local  authorities.   We  consider that theposition  in future would be  adequately  safeguarded by our recom-mendation that  approval must be obtained to the terms of all new capital issues.  429. On the latter point, i.e., making the fullest use of existing andfuture capital, a substantial  reduction in the  overall capital chargesper unit sold can be effected by endeavouring to connect all premisesalong the routes of existing mains and by persuading consumers toextend their use of the supply.  Even the most progressive under-takings  have agreed that saturation  of demand is not in  sight andthat the great variety of uses to which  electricity can now be put,coupled with reductions  in the prices charged to consumers, affordsscope for further expansion.  430. Our attention has been drawn  to the somewhat strikingincreases which  have recently  taken place in the prices quoted bymanufacturers for various  types of distribution cable.  We do not feel that it is within the scope of our investigation to make a detailedinquiry  into the relation which the revised prices for cables bear tothe cable makers&apos; costs of production.  431. The more widespread  adoption  by  supply authorities of standard types of cable would assist in reducing the capital costs ondistribution  systems,  and consequently  the selling  price to the
consumer.  We understand that there is a tendency for each supplyauthority to require  small variations in the design  of the cables,notwithstanding the  existence of British Standards  Specifications,These special requirements, multiplied greatly by the existing numberof undertakings and often applied only to quite small quantities ofcable, must necessarily increase the cost of manufacture.  432. Bearing in mind that capital charges represent one-half ofthe total cost of distribution and that cables represent a large pro-portion of  the capital expenditure on distribution, the cost of the cables  themselves  is  obviously an important factor  in connectionwith further  extensions of distribution systems, particularly in theless remunerative areas.  433.  The regrouping  of undertakings  into a smaller number of larger units should, however, not only result in a more widespreadadoption of standard types of cable, but should also place the supply authorities in a better  position to  negotiate contracts with  the manufacturers.                  MISCELLANEOUS POINTS  Among other matters  to which our attention has  been&apos; drawnreference may be made to the following:           (1)  Combined Gas and Electricity Undertakings  434.  Reference has  been made by several witnesses to the position which arises where the same authority has concurrent powers for thesupply of gas  as well  as  electricity.   While there are only 13 caseswhere Companies hold such concurrent powers in the same area, weare informed  that the number  of  Local Authorities holding such powers is considerable.  435.  It has been suggested that where the  Gas and electricity undertakings, although controlled by the same authority, are allowedto develop without  restrictions, the general result  is as  high a standard of efficiency  in both undertakings as would be obtained ifthey were developed under independent ownership.  436.  Instances have, however, been quoted where it would appearthat restrictions have been  imposed on the development  of  theElectricity  Undertaking in order to prevent the financial position ofthe Gas  Undertaking from being  adversely affected,  particularly where the  two undertakings  are  controlled by  a Joint Gas and electricity  Committee of a Local Authority.  437.  Where a Joint  Committee is appointed to secure co-co-ordination between the gas and electricity services, it must necessarily consider any proposal  relating  to one undertaking from the  point of view ofits effect on the other. It has been suggested to us in evidence that
 this may be detrimental to the proper development of the electricity undertaking which is the later undertaking to be established ;  may tend to suppress competition ;  and cannot make for progress.   438. The restrictions imposed are said to  take the form of dis- ecouraging extensions of mains in streets in which a supply of gas is already available ;  a reluctance on the part of a Joint Committee to introduce attractive tariffs or to reduce existing tariffs which would expand the output of the electricity undertaking ; or not providing for  the installation  of electricity  in housing  schemes  where gas is already installed.   439.  The latter restriction may extend to cases where the Local Authority, though not the authorised  undertakers for the supply of electricity, declines to allow the installation of electricity  (even at the  occupier&apos;s  expense) in their own housing schemes in which they have installed a supply of gas.   440.  Our attention has been drawn to the provisions of Section 27 of the Gas Undertakings Act, 1934, under which it is not lawful for a local authority to include in any instrument relating to the sale or letting  of  any  premises which they own  or in which they  have an interest, a  provision restricting  the right of any owner or  occupier of the premises to take a supply of gas.   While  a provision of this nature  would  not  be unreasonable,  if  applied   to both  gas  and electricity, we fail to appreciate why it should apply in favour of gas alone.  Such a limitation  is, in our opinion, an unfair restriction on the freedom of choice to which every consumer should be entitled.  441.  We recommend  that legislation  should provide  that  local authorities  should not in similar circumstances be entitled to restrict the right of any  owner or occupier of  premises to take a supply of electricity,  and   that  both  public  utilities  should  be  equally untrammelled.  442.  Where electricity undertakings  are in the  ownership of local authorities  which also  own the  gas undertaking, it would, in our opinion, assist  in  the more rapid development  of electricity if suchlocal authorities were required to have separate Committees.  443.  Every resident should have a free and  unrestricted  right to choose whether he will take a supply of gas or electricity, or both.This can only be achieved if both undertakings are  allowed to expand without restriction.                     (2) Electrical  Contractors  444.  We  have  received representations to  the effect that localauthorities  owning electricity undertakings are themselves carryingout installations  in consumers&apos; premises,  selling apparatus  to  con-sumers, and attending to repairs of consumers&apos; apparatus, and that
this policy is injuriously affecting  the position  of  electrical con-tractors whose business is that of installing circuits in and supplyingapparatus to  such premises.  445.  Our attention has been drawn to the provisions of Section 23of the  Electricity (Supply) Act, 1919, by  which  Joint  electricity authorities and Local  Authorities are authorised to provide, let forhire, connect, repair, maintain, remove (but not to manufacture orsell)  electric  lines,  fittings,  apparatus  and  appliances, and maydemand and take rents and charges in respect thereof.  446.  It  was  further enacted  in  Section  48  of the  Electricity(Supply) Act, 1926, that Joint  Electricity  Authorities  and LocalAuthorities authorised to supply electricity may sell electric  lines,fittings, apparatus and appliances for lighting, heating and motivepower and for all other purposes for which electricity can or may beused, and may install, connect, repair, maintain and remove the same.Restrictions are  imposed on  the  sale prices which may be charged by the  authorities.  447.  We have received testimony of the part played by electricalcontractors in the general development of electricity supply ;  thatthey have been  and are useful agents in acquiring new business.We think that generally the work of installing circuits and fixtures inconsumers&apos; premises can suitably be  performed by recognised com-petent  contractors   acting in  collaboration  with the  authoriseddistributors,  and we have been told  that in many districts this is done, with advantage to  both parties  and to the consumers.  448.  It  is,  in  our view,  necessary, however,   that the supply authorities should establish and maintain adequate showrooms and assist consumers with  hire-purchase installations and apparatus ofall kinds, especially the more expensive kinds  such as  cookers,refrigerators,  and water  heaters.  Above all, we consider  that theauthorities must maintain and have continuously available a service staff which can attend at short notice to any complaints received fromconsumers with  a view to effecting  remedies without loss  of  time.Such an organisation is, in our view, indispensable to the  fullest andbest service to the consumers and this, we think, can best be providedby the  supply authority itself.  449.  At the same time  the electrical contractor serves a useful and necessary  purpose,  and  we  think that supply  authorities shouldcollaborate with contractors  of recognised competency as much aspossible in their joint service to the public.             (3) Sup-plies from Non-Statutory Sources  450.  Complaints have been made regarding the supply of electricityby non-statutory bodies and persons in certain areas.   Section 23 ofthe Electric  Lighting  Act,  1909, made it  unlawful for any  local
authority, company or person to commence to supply or distributeelectricity (unless authorised by Act or Order)  within the same area as that in which there is a statutory undertaker.   But no company or person is thereby prevented from affording a supply to any othercompany or person where the business of the former is not primarilythat of supplying electricity to consumers.  451. Instances  have been  cited  of  bodies owning their  owngenerating plant affording supplies  to premises sometimes situatedat a considerable distance from the source of supply.  452. In these cases the supplier is not  subject  to any  statutory obligations  as to  the  prices  charged,  the continuity of  supply,voltage regulations and the many other conditions which a statutorydistributor is bound to observe in the public interest.  453. We understand that where the attention  of the ElectricityCommissioners  is  drawn  to the  establishment   of  non-statutorysupplies they serve a notice under Section  4 of the Electric LightingAct, 1888, requiring the non-statutory bodies to construct their lines and works in such manner as to comply with the Commissioners&apos;Regulations for the protection of the public safety, and of the lines and works of the Postmaster General, etc.  454. Cases have been cited of such unauthorised supplies  being given to local authorities for street lighting, sewage works, pumpingworks, and so forth, thus depriving the  authorised undertaker  of comparatively profitable loads, and increasing   the  difficulty  of affording a supply, particularly in a sparse district.  455. The present position appears to be unsatisfactory, and we areinformed that  in the area of one large  undertaker alone  there areno less than 32 such non-statutory systems supplying some 29,000consumers  and some 5,000 public lamps.   This constitutes a seriousinroad into the potential output of the statutory undertaker who is subject to  obligations and  penalties to neither of which the non-statutory body is liable.  456. We recommend that the provisions of Section  23 of the act of 1909  referred to above should be effectively strengthened. Nounauthorised supply to new consumers should in  future be allowed in the area of an authorised distributor without the consent of thatdistributor.   But  the consent must not be unreasonably  withheld,and there should be an appeal to the Electricity Commissioners, who should have power in appropriate circumstances of dispensing withthe authorised distributor^ consent if they are satisfied that it is  inthe public interest so to do.  457. We suggest, further, that provision might be made whereby,without  prejudice  to their statutory rights of supply, authoriseddistributors should be entitled  to  take  over  the  electric  lines and
other works of any non-statutory supplier within their area on thebasis of capital expenditure less depreciation.  Such powers should,however,  only be  exercised  with the  consent  of the ElectricityCommissioners,  and  only in cases where  the Commissioners aresatisfied that no  undue hardship will be imposed on the consumersconcerned as a result of the transfer.      (4) Assessment of Electricity Undertakings for Local Rates  458. Our attention  has been directed to the rating of  statutoryelectricity undertakings.  Reference has been made to this in previous reports and in the Weir Report,  1925, it  was stated that in theyear 1923 the Supply  Industry paid  2,191,437 in local rates.   the gross receipts in that year were  34,256,000, and the rates thereforerepresented 6- 4 per cent, of the total.  459. Since then, with the growth in the output of  the  Industry,the rates  have substantially increased, having risen to  4,448,000 in1933-34.  In that year the total gross receipts were  65,300,000, andthe amount paid in rates represented  6-8 per cent, of this sum, or14 per cent, of  the total working expenses.  460. It  has been pointed  out that under  the  provisions of the rating and Valuation (Apportionment) Act,  1928, the generatingplant of individual industries  is subject  to derating, whereas public utilities such as electricity, gas and water undertakings are specificallyexcluded from that benefit, and that this makes it difficult in manycases for  the  authorised distributors  to. compete  with privategenerating plant.  Blocks of  energy  output are thus lost  to the authorised distributor, and, therefore, to the Grid system.  461. We feel that the problem of derating is a matter  of public policy, which applies to other  public utilities as well as to electricity supply, on which we cannot comment.   We must be content to draw attention  to the position.  462. Other representations  have been made on  the variation in treatment accorded  to electricity  undertakings by  the  numerousassessment authorities, and to  the difficulties with  which  under-takings are confronted when endeavouring to develop  rural areas.  463. We think there is  substance in these complaints, and that a uniform method of assessment should apply to all electricity under-takings throughout the United  Kingdom.   We understand  that itwould be  equitable and would remove the existing difficulties  if an assessment were  based on the undertaking  as a whole,  the  grossassessment being subsequently  apportioned among the respectiveassessable districts, but so that the aggregate amount paid would notexceed the assessment of  the  undertaking regarded  as an  entity.
          (5) Compensation for Deprivation of Employment  464. In the course of evidence which has been given by variousAssociations, it has been suggested that as a result of any scheme of reorganisation based  on the amalgamation of some of the presentmultiple undertakings into a smaller number of larger and more economic systems, a larger (and not a smaller) number of officers and servants will be necessary in due course to deal with the expansion and development  which  it is anticipated will flow from suchreorganisation ;  that there would in the  future be wider  oppor-tunities  of  advancement ;   and  that,  generally  speaking,  the consolidated undertakings should have no difficulty  in absorbingthe  officers  and servants previously  employed  by the  acquiredundertakings.  465. While we are  of opinion that the adoption of the scheme of reorganisation  which we  recommend  should  lead to an  actualexpansion of employment in the Electricity Supply Industry, theremay, however, be some temporary disturbance of employment untilthe full results of reorganisation are realised.  466. In particular, a reduction in the  number of undertakingswould  probably involve  some  reduction  in the  number  of chiefengineers and managers, some of whom might be too old to obtain further employment, or might have to accept a post  involving some loss of status.  467. We recommend, therefore, that legislation for  giving effectto our proposals should give full protection by providing for adequatecompensation to officers  and servants  who may be displaced, or whose position may be adversely affected.  468. It has been suggested by certain bodies that in some aspectsthe present compensation provisions are  inequitable  and  operateprejudicially against claimants.  Particular reference has been madeto such matters as the  onus of proof on the claimant, the  service which  should count towards compensation, and the form in whichthe compensation is awarded.   It has been urged,  therefore, that inany further legislation dealing with the distribution of electricity,the opportunity should be taken to revise the compensation provisions in their general application under the Electricity (Supply) Acts.  469. We feel  that  the consideration  of  a general  amendment ofthe compensation provisions is  outside our Terms of  Reference, and while we have drawn attention to the representations which havebeen made, we  do  not propose to comment thereon except to  saythat we  are of  opinion that owing to  the numerous  amendments which have been made to the compensation provisions as originallyenacted in Section 16 of the Act of 1919, it is desirable that  in new legislation  applying  compensation provisions  to any scheme  of
reorganisation of distribution, the opportunity should be taken to consolidate  all  the  existing compensation provisions relating  toelectricity supply. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  470. Owing to  the  many and varied problems which arise  inconnection with the organisation of distribution, it is not possibleto present  in  a  small compass  a  comprehensive  review of  the numerous considerations  involved.   We give below,  however, asummary of our principal conclusions and recommendations.   the summary does not purport to be exhaustive and necessarily excludesreference to many of  the  somewhat less important points whichare dealt with in the main body of the Report:                         (A) Organisation  471. (i) An improvement can and should be effected in the present organisation with its numerous  undertakings,  the  widespreadduplication  of powers, the liability to further disintegration by theexercise of individual local authority purchase rights and the manyand varied systems and voltages of supply and tariffs in operation.  (ii)  The essential features of any scheme of reorganisation mustbe :-       (a) a substantial reduction in the present  number of under-    takings by the  substitution where  appropriate  of larger and    more economic units;       (&amp;) the prevention  of  the splitting up of  comprehensive    undertakings in consequence of the exercise of rights of purchase    by individual local authorities ;       (c)  the  elimination of duplicate powers wherever they exist    in the same area.  (iii)  Adequate grounds do not exist for an immediate and com-plete  reorganisation on a regional basis under public control by the setting up of regional boards which would buy out  all existingundertakings.  (iv)  Reorganisation should be based on the retention and utilisation-tion, where possible, of the larger and more efficient of the existingundertakings and the absorption by such undertakings of the smalleror less efficient undertakings.  (v)  Any attempt to  carry through a scheme of reorganisation ona voluntary  basis is bound to fail and legislation must confer definite and adequate compulsory powers.  (vi)  The schemes of reorganisation should make provision for thepossibility of ultimate public ownership of all undertakings, including those  not at present subject to purchase  by the local authorities. -
  (vii)  No  undertakings  should be transferred compulsorily undera scheme of reorganisation without a prior local investigation.  Tothis  end the Electricity Commissioners should be  empowered todelimit the country into a number of areas and to appoint for each area a  temporary District  Commissioner, with such technical andfinancial assistance  as may be necessary.  (viii)  All undertakings in an area should be brought under review by the District Commissioner.   It should be his duty to prepare and submit  to  the Electricity Commissioners a scheme or schemes of reorganisation for  the  area.   Advisory Committees  comprisingrepresentatives of the undertakers in each area should be appointedto assist the District Commissioner in  a consultative capacity.  (ix) After schemes have been prepared simple machinery shouldbe available for giving effect to them without undue delay.   TheElectricity Commissioners after publishing a scheme and considering any  representations should be  empowered  to approve it with or without modifications.  It should thereupon  become  operative incases where :       (a)  the scheme is agreed by the undertakers concerned, or      (6)  the individual output of any undertakings proposed to    be  acquired  compulsorily  under  the scheme  did  not exceed     10 million units in the year ending 31st March, 1936.  In any  other cases a scheme when  approved by the ElectricityCommissioners should not become operative  unless confirmed bythe Minister of Transport and approved by Parliament.  (x) We  anticipate that in most cases it will  be found that PowerCompanies will be retained under the area schemes.  In such event the undertakings should be consolidated on a basis which should include :       (a)  the amalgamation   of  the  distribution undertakings,    whether  held  by the Power  Company  or  by subsidiary or    associated  companies, with the  non-purchasable  Power Act    undertaking ;      (b)  the suspension of local authority rights of purchase  ;      (c)  the transfer  to the Power Companies, where appropriate,    of small undertakings in or adjacent to the Power Act area.  (xi) At  the end of a prescribed period, which  in no case shouldexceed 50 years, the consolidated undertaking of the retained PowerCompanies, including the part  at present non-purchasable, shouldbe liable to purchase by some form of public authority on the basisof capital expenditure  less depreciation.
  (xii) During the consolidated tenure a retained Power company should be subject to financial control, which should include :        (a) the application of an effective sliding scale relating prices    to profits ;       (b) the approval  by the Electricity  Commissioners of  the    terms of issue of new capital;       (c) more effective  control by the Minister of Transport in    regard to methods of charge.  (xiii)  If a  satisfactory  scheme for the retention of a  particularPower Company cannot be evolved or a Power Company so elects,it should be competent for a scheme to provide for the immediatepurchase of  the  Power  Company&apos;s  undertaking, including  theirperpetuity rights, and its  transfer to some form of public  authority.  (xiv)  Where  Distribution  Companies are retained  or  set  up under  an area  scheme, it should  be on a  consolidated  basis andthey should be subject to financial control similar to that recom-mended  for Power Companies.  The  period for  the  consolidatedtenure should not exceed a maximum of 50 years and would depend,inter alia, on the present unexpired franchise.  The  undertakingshould be purchasable as a whole at the end of the tenure on  thebasis of capital expenditure less depreciation.  (xv) The powers  of the Electricity  Commissioners in  regard tothe exercise of purchase rights by local authorities should be strength-ened.   No such rights should be exercisable without the consent ofthe Commissioners, who should be empowered to suspend or equatesuch rights ;  to provide that they shall only be  exercised jointly ;and,  where appropriate, to transfer them to some other body.  (xvi)  It should be the objective of a consolidated undertaking tobring about uniformity of tariffs as soon as possible, but a certainamount of zoning may be necessary for a transitional period.  (xvii) Legislation  should  define clearly   the  terms  on  whichundertakings, both Local Authority and Company, should be acquired by or merged with another undertaking.  (xviii)  In the case of the acquisition of  Local Authority under-takings, the basis of purchase should be the  fair value of the assets,i.e., cost less depreciation.  No addition should be made either inrespect of contributions from the rates in previous years  or of any right to contribute to the rates.  (xix)  In the case of the acquisition of company undertakings,  thebasis of purchase should  be  the fair value  of the assets with  theaddition of compensation for loss of future profits.  Regard shouldbe had  (a)  in the case of distribution companies to the unexpired
period of their  franchise ;  (b) in the case of power companies totheir perpetuity rights; and (c) in both cases to the limitation of profits to which they would have been subject under the proposedschemes if they had not been acquired.  Allowance should be madefor unfructified capital expenditure incurred during the three yearsprior  to purchase  to the  extent to which it  had not  becomeremunerative.   (xx) All supply  authorities  whose  undertakings   are  acquiredcompulsorily under a scheme should have a right of appeal to an arbitration Tribunal on the question of the amount of the purchase price.   (xxi)  The  Electricity  Commissioners  should  be empowered torequire undertakers (a) to submit and to carry out approved schemesof extensions for undeveloped areas, and (b) to offer facilities forthe hire or hire-purchase of apparatus and assisted wiring.   (xxii) The Electricity Commissioners should  be empowered to effect minor boundary adjustments of area as between two adjacentundertakings.   (xxiii)  The local Advisory Committees comprising representativesof the Supply Authorities should, with modified representation inaccordance with the reorganised areas, be retained for consultativepurposes.                           (B)  London   472. (i) The London and Home Counties Electricity District mayappropriately form a delimited  area for investigation by a district commissioner.   (ii) The large number of undertakings in this  area,  some withduplication  of powers, the differing systems and tariffs, and theinequality in the facilities offered, justify criticism on the part ofthe public. A substantial measure of amalgamation and co-ordinationis possible and necessary.   (iii) The extent to  which such amalgamations should  be effectedmust be a matter  for consideration by the District Commissionerwhen preparing a scheme  or schemes  for the area.   (iv) No variation of the principles of the settlement effected bythe London  Electricity Acts (No.  1) and (No. 2), 1925,  should becontemplated,  except  as   may be  consequential to  a  physicalamalgamation of the  Companies concerned.   (v) The present  constitution  of the London and Home Counties.Joint Electricity Authority should be brought under review.
                     (C) Holding Companies  473.  (i) The advantages offered by the holding company system in  regard  to central management, central purchasing, and theprovision of adequate financial resources have in certain cases been achieved.  (ii) There are, however, some cases where the benefits of amalgama-tion are not  being passed on to the  operating subsidiary companies,and there are possibilities of abuse.  (iii) The Electricity Commissioners should be empowered to requirethe amalgamation of subsidiary companies  with one another and,where desirable and practicable, with the Holding Company or anyassociated contracting company.  (iv) The accounts of a Holding Company which controls subsidiary companies owning or operating authorised undertakings and anyassociated contracting or management companies should be subjectto official audit.  (v) At any  inquiry into the maximum  prices of a subsidiarycompany, any profits made by a Holding Company in  its dealings with subsidiary companies should be taken into account.           (D) Standardisation of Systems and Voltages  474.  (i)  Complete standardisation of systems and voltages shouldbe the ultimate objective.   This is  not immediately practicablewithout either some form  of  Government assistance  or a generallevy on the supply industry, neither of which is justified.  (ii) The reorganisation recommended should facilitate and expeditestandardisation,  which is already being carried  out voluntarily by certain undertakers wholly or in part.  (iii) A scheme should provide where appropriate for standardisation-tion within the  area  of a  consolidated undertaking and within a prescribed period.            (E) Standardisation of Methods of Charge  475.  (i)  Amalgamation of undertakings into  a smaller numberof  larger   undertakings  will  be  an  important  step  towardsstandardisation of methods of charge and more uniform prices.  (ii) The Minister of Transport should be empowered to require allundertakers to  offer an  approved statutory two-part  tariff  for domestic supplies as  an  optional alternative to a flat rate charge.
  (iii)  The fixed charge under an approved  two-part tariff  shouldbe based  either on size of house (floor area) or on rateable value,unless the undertakers  satisfy the Minister that some other basis is justified, in view of special circumstances obtaining in their area.  (iv)  All  undertakers  should be required to publish  the  actualscale of fixed charges under their two-part tariff.  (v)  Supply Authorities must  be allowed  flexibility in quotingspecial rates for special  classes of supply.       (F) Further Extension of Facilities, including Supplies                         in Rural Areas  476. (i) It should be competent for schemes to provide for dis-tribution mains of adequate  capacity being laid within a prescribed period in  built up streets in  urban areas where such mains are not already laid.  (ii)  The creation of a demand in small class property should be encouraged  by the offer of  facilities for hire and hire-purchase  of apparatus  and  assisted wiring and by a more extensive  use  oftwo-part tariff prepayment meters.  (iii)  Supply  Authorities should be  empowered  in  appropriate cases to carry their cables under the eaves of houses.  (iv)  Development of  rural areas has  been made more difficult byprior and independent development of urban areas.  In the proposedschemes rural areas should, as far as possible, be grouped with urban areas.  (v)  As a result of such reorganisation considerable further develop-ment  of rural areas should be possible.   We do not recommend any form of Government subsidy.  (vi)  Some modification of the requisition provisions of the Scheduleto the Electric Lighting (Clauses) Act,  1899,  is desirable.  TheElectricity  Commissioners should be  empowered to  prescribe  in suitable cases a lower guarantee of revenue than 20 per cent,  on thecapital  expenditure involved.   Where a  capital  contribution  isrequired in  connection  with  a supply to isolated  premises the con-sumer should be  entitled to some proportionate refund if otherconsumers are within a period of three years supplied through thesame main.  (vii) Local  Authorities might in certain cases  be empowered  toparticipate in a guarantee in connection with the supply to villagesin their district.  (viii) The  Minister  of Transport  should  be   empowered whengranting  compulsory wayleaves  to fix the wayleave rentals  and compensation.
                    (G) Reduction in Costs  477.  (i)  The  scheme  recommended  should result  in a generalthough necessarily gradual reduction in costs.  (ii) New capital must be raised on  the cheapest possible terms and used to the best advantage.  (iii) Existing capital must be utilised to the fullest possible extent by connecting all premises on the route of existing mains not alreadysupplied, and by  educating existing  consumers  to  make a  moreextended use of the supply.  (iv) A  greater standardisation  of types  of cable would reduce their cost.               (H) Miscellaneous Recommendations  478.  Combined Gas and  Electricity Undertakings. (i) Where gasand electricity undertakings are left under the joint ownership of alocal authority it would assist in the more rapid development of theelectricity undertaking if  the  authority were  required to  haveseparate Committees.  (ii) A local authority should not be entitled to restrict the rightof any  owner or  occupier of premises to take a supply of electricity.The services of gas and electricity should be given equal facilities.  479.  Non-Statutory  Undertakings. (i)  Section  23 of the electric lighting Act, 1909, should  be strengthened to the effect that a non-statutory body should not be allowed to supply electricity  to newconsumers within the  area of supply of  an authorised undertakerwithout the consent of such undertakers, subject to a right of appealto the  Electricity Commissioners.  (ii) Authorised undertakers should be  entitled, with the consentof the  Electricity Commissioners, to acquire the mains  and otherapparatus used  by non-statutory bodies for supplying consumers,on the  basis of capital expenditure, less depreciation.  This consentshould  only be given where the Commissioners are satisfied that noundue  hardship  would fall on the consumer.  480.  Rating. It is  desirable that  a  more uniform method of assessment should be applied to all electricity undertakings.  481.  Compensation  for   Deprivation  of Employment. (i)  while there may be some disturbance of employment in the initial  stages of reorganisation, the subsequent  expansion  of the Industry should result in increased employment.
  (ii) Legislative provision should  be made for  the  payment of adequate compensation to officers and servants who may be displacedor whose position may be worsened.  (iii)  The original  compensation provisions with their numeroussubsequent amendments should be consolidated in one enactment.  482. Consolidation of Legislation. An early  opportunity shouldbe  taken of consolidating  the various Electricity Acts  into  oneup-to-date enactment.  483. We are satisfied that the application of our recommendations will result in an improved organisation  of  the  Electricity  supply industry, which will be reflected in more widespread  supplies atlower and more uniform charges. We must point out, however, thatthe improvement  must,  under  the  best  conditions,  be necessarilygradual.  484. We  record  our  appreciation  of  the  valuable  assistance we  have received from the various bodies and witnesses who have submitted evidence.  We are specially indebted to the ElectricityCommissioners, who have unreservedly placed at  our disposal theexperience they have acquired in an administrative  capacity, as aresult  of their intimate contact with  all phases of the electricity supply Industry during the past sixteen years.  485. In conclusion, we desire to express our indebtedness to ourSecretary, Mr. A. E.

93234APPENDIX  IIStatistics for the Year 1933-34 and Graphs based on Returns rendered to the  Electricity Commissioners  by Authorised Undertakers  in  Great Britain   (1) At the end  of the year 1933-34 there were 635 separate authorisedundertakers, as follows : Central Electricity Board      ..     . .     . .     . .       1Joint Electricity Authorities   . .     . .     . .     . .       3Joint Boards (representative of Local Authorities)  . .       5Local Authorities        . .     ..     . .     . .     . .    373Companies and persons  . .     . .     . .     . .     . .    253635  The number of undertakers actually supplying electricity  at the  end of1933-34 was 628, inclusive of the Central Electricity Board.  In the remainingcases the powers had not been exercised or a supply commenced.  The number of separate  &quot; undertakings &quot; authorised by Acts and  Ordersexceeds the number of undertakers by whom the powers are held.  Countingcontiguous undertakings of the same undertaker as constituting one combinedundertaking, but geographically separated undertakings as distinct  under-takings, the 627 undertakers (other than the Central Board) who were supplyingelectricity at the end of 1933-34  were operating what may be regarded forthe purposes of this Statistical Summary as 643 undertakings.  (2) The number of units of electricity sold to consumers and the averagerevenue per unit sold by these undertakers in 1933-34 were as follows : Class of Supply.	Units Sold to Consumers 1933-34.

The above figures are incomplete in respect of certain undertakingswhere the revenue obtained from the sale of energy to consumers was notcompletely apportioned between the different classes of supply.   In  the case of Companies operating two or more undertakings the aboveanalysis is based, in general, upon the average for the combined undertakings.   In  the first section of the table relating to  Lighting,  Heating and Cookingsupplies, the higher average revenues are wholly or mainly in respect of lightingsupplies.
