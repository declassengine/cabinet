THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT&apos; Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 160 (36).CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATY  NEGOTIATIONS.                            MILITARY CLAUSES.         Memorandum, by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    IN accordance with the conclusions of the fourth meeting of  the  Anglo-Egyptian  Conversations  Committee  on the 16th  June last,  I  submit for theconsideration of my colleagues drafts of military articles of a future  Anglo-Egyptian  Treaty and certain comments and  explanations  of these proposals.Though my proposals are submitted in the form of draft articles (see Annex), asbeing most convenient, nevertheless I wish to repeat the observations made inparagraph 5 of my paper to the  Cabinet CP. 136 (36) as regards the dangers of crystallising into fixed formulae at  too early a stage.  My proposals thereforeare intended to cover any forms of words which will produce the same effect.    The first and most important point is a provision to secure a permanent.alliance and that the permanent alliance should include a British right to protect the Suez Canal.  In this connexion I would draw attention first  of all to article14 and to  the third sentence of article 14 which reads : &quot;It  is agreed that any revision of this treaty will provide for the  continuation of the alliance betweenthe High  Contracting Parties and will incorporate  the principles contained in articles 6,  7 and 8.&quot;  In this way there is secured in permanence not merely an alliance between the United Kingdom and Egypt but the important &quot;facilities &quot;of article 8.  Under article 8 it is provided that in  time of war or menace of warthe King of Egypt furnishes to His Britannic Majesty all the facilities in his power including the use of Egyptian ports and means of communication. Further,in an apprehended emergency it  is providecL^hat His Britannic Majesty maysend such  f orcejs jJiTJtt^^British iTavaT forces riTialF-RAiiWjfi^1.;f^iniijfijg fa- jfrjfrypfciAfa ports,  Any danger tothe SueT^arIai^wbuM&quot;&quot;undoulDtedly be  an  &quot;apprehended emergency&quot; and weshall thus  have the right in such a case to land in the Canal&quot;ZbriVany number oftroops  that His Majesty&apos;s Government think necessary.  By dealing with thematter in this way, however, we do not only get this right in the event of a threat to the Suez Canal but also in other cases.  Nor  is the  right to send troops limitedto sending them to the Canal Zone. The rights  which we should secure, therefore,would be more extensive in dealing with the matter  in this way  than if it  were dealt with by additions to article 9 which is confined to the  Suez Canal and itszone.  Another advantage of dealing with the matter in this way is that it followsso closely  upon  the  actual statements  of  Nahas  Pasha  about  the  permanentalliance and its corollaries, and the suggestion  of Makram that the apprehendedemergency formula should be inserted in article 8,  and therefore would perhaps be more readily accepted  than an addition to article 9.   If it should  not beconsidered sufficiently clear that the Suez Canal would be covered  by the proposalindicated  above,  I would remind my colleagues  that  we always have nahas pasha&apos;s paper of the 1st June to  fall back  upon.   This paper was circulated tomy colleagues  under the number  J5160/2/16, on  the 8th June [&quot;Egypt  andSudan,&quot; June 8, Section 1].      8672  [13387]
     The end of article 9 provides, in accordance with the general agreement of the  last meeting,  that, if at the end of the period of twenty years there is  a dispute as to whether the Egyptian army are able to protect the  Canal unaided, this question shall be decided by the Council of the League of  Nations acting unanimously (apart from the parties in dispute) or such other body as may be agreed upon.  A  proposal  was  made that it should be specified here that the Egyptian Government should, if they wished to raise the matter at the end of the  twenty  years,  give notice one year in advance to His Majesty&apos;s Government in order that before the matter could be submitted  to the Council of the League there should be a  year in which  the parties could endeavour to settle the matter by agreement.  After consideration  I have thought it better not to adopt this suggestion because I think  its practical  effect would be that the question^ would be raised one year sooner than it otherwise might be.   There will be no mduce- ment to any  Egyptian Government  to  invite other Powers to pronounce upon Egypfs military efficiency if there is any possibility of Egypt getting what she wants in any other way.  I regard it as  certain therefore that no reference to an outside party would take place  as regards this matter unless and until it had been found by thorough negotiation that  no other settlement was possible.   Under the existing text His Majesty&apos;s Government could,  if it were thought desirable, decline seriously to discuss  the matter until the twenty-year period had expired.     The only one of the six points enumerated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the meeting of  the 15th  June which  has not been dealt with  above is No. 3, &quot;the recognition  of Egyptian sovereignty.&quot;   The Egyptian sovereignty  overthe Canal Zone is  recognised in terms in article  9.   Egypfs status as a sovereign State is implicit in most of the articles  of the proposed treaty.  A  provisionstating in terms that His Majesty recognised Egypt as a sovereign State wouldprobably not  be welcome to the Egyptians  seeing that they claim this statusalready and His Majesty&apos;s Government purported to confer it on  Egypt in 1922.     With reference to the suggestion that article 14 should be dropped, it shouldbe observed that: -     (1) The Egyptian delegation will  almost certainly object strongly to the          omission of the article.     (2) Even though the fact that the alliance articles  are made permanent and          that the Canal article is given its own revision stipulation does not          leave much of the treaty for article 14 to operate upon, there are still          some articles, e.g.,  those with regard to the  Capitulations, which are          covered by this article.     (3) Article 14 affords in my  view the most convenient and to the Egyptians          acceptable  manner of  making  the  alliance  permanent,  i.e.,  by          providing for revision, but agreeing in advance that the new treaty          must embody the alliance articles.                                                                    A. E.    Foreign Office, June  19,  1936.
                               Draft Articles.    Article 5. An alliance is established between the High Contracting Partieswith a view to consolidating their friendship, their cordial understanding andtheir good relations.          6. Each of the High Contracting Parties  undertakes not to  adopting relation to foreign countries an attitude which is inconsistent with the alliance,nor to conclude political treaties inconsistent with the provisions of the presenttreaty.    A rt. 7. Should any dispute with a third State arise, which involyesjLjiskof a rupture with that&quot; State,  the High Contracting Parties wilTconsult eachotrleT^mF a view to the settlement of  the  said dispute by peaceful means,  inaccordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations and ofany other international obligations which may be applicable to the case.    Art.  Q-1.  Should, notwithstanding  the provisions  of article  7(x) above,either of the High Contracting Parties  become engaged in war, the other HighContracting Party will, subject always  to the provisions  of article 12(J) below,immediately come to his aid in the capacity of an ally.  The aid of His majesty the King of Egypt in the event of war or imminent^ineiiace^f^war^will consist infurnishing to His  Britannic Majesty on Egyptian territory, in  accordance&apos;withthe Egyptian system of administration and legislation,  all the  facilities and assistance in his power, including the use of his ports,  aerodromes and means ofcommunication.  It will accordingly be for the Egyptian Government to  take allthe administrative and legislative measures necessary  to render these facilities and assistance effective.    2.) In an  apprehended emergency^ His Britannic Majestyjrn^^^send  such forces! Winay be necessary to ensure the protection of his essen ti a I co I n run n ic a t i on sand his naval forces^Mll have  full facilities in Egyptian ports.    [Provisions will  have to be inserted here about Alexandria and the witb-drawal of the troops from Cairo, but these articles have not been drafted.]    Art. 9. In view of the fact that the Suez  Canal, while being an integral part of Egypt, is a universal means of communication as also an essential meansof communication between the different parts of the British Empire, His majesty the King  of Egypt, until such  time as the High  Contracting Parties agree thatthe Egyptian army is in a position to ensure by its own resources the liberty andentire security of navigation of the Canal,  authorises His Britannic Majesty to station forces in Egyptian territory in the vicinity of the  Canal, with a view toensuring1^^ co-operation  with the Egyptian forces the defence  of  the  Canal.The  detailed  arrangements  for  the  carrying  into effect  of this article  are contained in the Annex hereto.  The presence of these forces shall not constitutein any manner an  occupation, and will in no way prejudice the  sovereign rightsof Egypt.    It is  understood  that  at the end of the period  of  twenty years specified inarticle  14 the  question whether  the  presence  of British  forces is no  longer necessary  owing to the fact that the Egyptian army is in a position to ensure by its own resources the liberty and entire security of navigation on the Canal may,if there  has been  any difference between  the High  Contracting  Parties, besubmitted to the Council of the League of Nations for decision in  accordance withthe provisions of the  Covenant in  force at the time of signature of the  presenttreaty or to  such other person or body of persons for decision in accordance withsuch procedure as the High Contracting Parties may agree.                            Annex  to Article 9.    1.   Without prejudice to  the provisions of article 8,  the  numbers  of theforces of  His Britannic Majesty  to be maintained  in  the  vicinity of the suez canal shall not exceed.....    A rt. 14. At any time after the expiration of a period of twenty years from thecoming into force of the treaty, the High Contracting Parties will,  at the request                   (!)  References to numbers of 1930 draft articles.ANNEX.
of either of them, enter into negotiations with a view to such revision of its termsby agreement between them as may be appropriate  in the circumstances as they then exist.  In case of the High Contracting Parties being unable to agree uponthe term^of the revised treaty, the  difference will be submitted to the Council ofthe League of Nations for decision in accordance with the provisions  of theCovenant in force at the time of  signature -of  the present treaty or to  such other person or body of persons for decision in accordance with  such  procedure as the High Contracting  Parties may agree.   It is agreed that any revision ofthis treaty will provide for the continuation of the Alliance between the HighContracting Parties and will incorporate the principles  contained in  articles 6,7  and 8.  Nevertheless, with the  consent  of both High  Contracting Parties,negotiations may be entered into at any time after the  expiration of a period often years after  the coming into force of the treaty, with a  view to such revision asaforesaid.     [N.B. The question of the application of article 14 to the Sudan is discussed in the Paper dealing with the Sudan, circulated to my colleagues under the numberCP. 176 (36).]
