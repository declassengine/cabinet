Copy No.CP. 156 (36).CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATY NEGOTIATIONS.            Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.        &apos;  &apos;:     MY  colleagues will have read  the telegrams  from  His  Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner in Cairo describing the reception by Nahas Pasha of the proposals which Sir Miles Lampson was instructed to put forward in pursuance of Cabinet Conclusion 38 (36) of the 20th May.   They will have seen  that the head of the Egyptian delegation  stated that  he was quite unable to accept these proposals, and, in view of  the  serious position revealed by the deadlock thus  reached in Cairo, His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner was instructed to proceed to London for purposes of consultation.  This paper is designed to set out the issues as they stand in present  circumstances. General.     2.  The first general question to be considered is that the world situation has changed definitely since the instructions for treaty conversations were given to Sir Miles Lampson last February.  The present position of  Italy in the Eastern Mediterranean as a consequence of her conquest of Abyssinia, the  disturbance in Palestine,  the  possibility of unfavourable  reactions  in  the  Near East,  the increasingly  aggressive  militarism of  Japan,  and  the growing likelihood  of untoward developments in Europe and elsewhere, mate it all the  more  essential to avoid complications in  Egypt.  If we fail to get a treaty with  Egypt,  the situation there will deteriorate, and we may before long be faced with  a  situation requiring repressive measures and large further forces of occupation in Egypt. This aspect has been more fully treated in CP. 131 (36) of the 8th May.     3.  The elements in the case for our decision seem to be  simple : (a)  with our present military  resources  we obviously cannot afford to have difficulties every- where; (b) dangers to this country and the Commonwealth from various quarters may be apprehended from (i) Germany, (ii) Italy, (iii) Japan  in the event of  (i) or (ii) materialising.  Either (i) or (ii) may materialise in the near future, though Germany  is  the more  formidable military  menace.   Moreover,  Germany&apos;s potential threat is not to the communications but to the heart of the Empire.    4.  In the light of the above  situation it seems essential not to let an oppor- tunity slip to clear up in so far as we can our position in the Mediterranean  as soon as can be contrived, since it  is not possible to feel confidence that another move by Germany will not take place in the near future.  We may not be able to effect this clearance quickly with Italy, but should seek to do so now with Egypt. Nahas Pasha appears to have made striking progress in goodwill and  good sense since 1930; and it is probable that this is largely due to the Egyptian apprehension formerly non-existent-^-of the Italian danger on two borders.  On the  otherhand, we must be under no delusion that, were His Majesty&apos;s Government to fail to profit by the present favourable opportunity to  reach  some really  friendly    8646   [13326]                            &apos;
 agreement with Egypt, our difficulties would inevitably be increased by a tendency, of which there are already marked signs on the part of the Egyptians, to turn their  eyes  towards Italy.   There is no doubt  that Signor  Mussolini&apos;s recent success has  considerably impressed  at  our expense  the timorous and receptive Egyptian public.   A situation might  thus arise when danger (ii)  might begin to overtake and co-exist with danger (i),  and with such a situation an Egypt whom we!had antagonised could make our position definitely untenable. Present Position of the Discussions:    - 5.  Sir  M. Lampson has reported that the &quot;Egyptians have refused to accept two major treaty stipulations, providing      (1) A recognition  of a  British right  to  military occupation  of the  Suez           Canal Zone in perpetuity.     (2) Independent  -action  by  Great  Britain for  the protection  of the  Suez           Canal, i.e., enjoyment by  Great Britain of the rights allocated under   &apos;.    &apos;    article 9 of the Suez Canal Convention of 1888 to Egypt and not merely           those allocated to Turkey.   ,  6.  The Egyptian Prime Minister has stated categorically that insistence on either of these two points would involve the breakdown of treaty discussions.     7.  Further, there  is another outstanding major point,  viz., the continued occupation of Alexandria.  To this the  Egyptians have shown strong  opposition except on the basis of a clearly defined and not too extensive  time limit.  :     8.  I must now ask my colleagues to consider whether we can agree to  such modifications of  our  desiderata  on  these three points as- would render  them acceptable to the Egyptians.   In doing so I must  invite especial attention to a new and most interesting development one, indeed,  which is, in my opinion, of capital importance in view of the  rapidly and disadvantageously altering situation in Europe.   Within the  last few days several times  orally and also in a formal memorandum handed to Sir  M. Lampson on the 1st  June for communication to His  Majesty&apos;s Government,  Nahas Pasha has made an important declaration. Referring to the provisions  of the 1930 draft treaty relating to the alliance(l) Nahas Pasha has stated  that Great Britain would,  under those provisions,  be entitled  not  only to take the &quot;unlimited measures  of military  co-operation&quot; provided for in  the clauses of the 1930 draft,  but also to take these measures &quot;. even after  the evacuation of Egyptian territory by British  troops.  In Other words, Whether British troops did or did  not  remain  in  the  country,  Britain&apos;sco-operation  in the defence  of the Canal remains intact.&quot;   Nahas Pasha has since informed the Acting High Commissioner on  4th June that he  and hiscolleagues, meant that our troops could come back literally  at any time, - with no limit whatever, in case  of &quot;apprehended emergency.&quot;(&quot;)   His Excellencyadded that the new formula of &quot;apprehended emergency&quot;  would hold goodequally at any time (*.*?.,  after, no less than before, the evacuation of egytian territory by  our troops,  should this, have taken place).  He said  that what the egyptians offered was  a perpetual treaty of  alliance.   The  time limit,  he explained, specified in the 1930 draft  referred to revision of the need for military occupation, not to the principle of military alliance,&quot;which was to be of unlimitedduration.   He asserted that they all  wished this principle to  be  adopted as theimmutable pivot of Egyptian policy.          ... &apos; : (?)  The reference is apparently to article 8 of the 1930 draft,  which article reads as follows:   ;-     &quot; Should, notwithstanding the provisions of article 7 above, either of the high contracting -/I parties become &quot;engaged in war, the other high  contracting  party will,  subject.always to the  - ; provisions of article 12 below,  immediately come to his aid  in the capacity of an ally.  The .  aid of His Majesty the King of Egypt, in the event of war,  or imminent menace of war, will   consist in furnishing to His Britannic, Majesty, on Egyptian territory, in accordance with, the v&apos; . Egyptian system of administration and legislation,  all&apos; the facilities and assistance in&apos;his   power, including the use  of his ports,&apos; aerodromes and means of communication.  It will . rl. accordingly be for the Egyptian Government to take  all the administrative and. legislative   measures necessary to render these facilities and assistance  effective.&quot;             . ; p &apos;-: :(*)  This refers&apos;to an agreement  reached in recent discussions that His. Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould have the right to reinforce their forces in Egypt not only in case of war,,or menace of war,but also in case. of. apprehended emergency,- that &quot;is to say,;.before, a state of acute crisis is reached-.
                                    :  m                                27                                     3    9.  It will be seen that Nahas Pasha refers to the continuance of-the alliance and of the important facilities provided by article 8  (together with theright  to send troops in case of an apprehended emergency) not merely after -the&apos;termination, if it has occurred, of the occupation, but apparently  indefinitely.As a matter of textual interpretation of the 1930 draft, Nahas Pasha&apos;s statement is, in  fact, not accurate, since the 1930 draft in article 9 contemplated a revisionof the British occupation of the Canal Zone,- and in article 14  the revision of thewhole treaty. The importance,- however, of his statement is that it may justifiablybe taken as expressing a principle to which Egypt is ready to agree.   It is conse-quently of extreme importance; and in view of its repetition,  we are justified in asking him to make a  suitable  addition to the  1930  draft with a view to establishing the principle of a perpetual alliance.  If we were able to secure some such addition, this Would remove  one of the grave objections to our admission ofthe possibility of our evacuation of the Canal Zone.  It would also fender far  less important the inclusion in  the treaty of a recognition by  Egypt of a permanentBritish right  to  protect the  Suez Canal.  Indeed,  it may  be  argued that  apermanent alliance is such a recognition, since the whole raison (Tetre of  the alliance from our point of view is  to provide security for British communications.    lOf .I&apos;t 4s  for consideration  whether  in the.  light of  the  above,  and of  thedisquieting limitation of our resources during  the  crucial years immediately ahead, it is wise to risk a breakdown  in the discussions when we can apparentlysecure a.treaty giving to us,  even if some time  after twenty years we were to evacuate the Canal Zone, the right to bring back our forces in unlimited numbers in the event of an apprehended emergency.British Claim  to act independently of Egypt for the Protection of the Suez        Canal.  &apos;    11.  The object of this requirement is that His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldhave the right to take  action independently of Egypt, particularly  to  preventsabotage of the Canal and generally to ensure its safe navigation, by recourse, if:necessary, to British martial law in the Canal Zone.  By the same provision it was intended to secure a legal sanction for the declaration of British martial iawrnthe Canal Zone should this be necessary, though no reference was to be made -interms to martial law.                                                      !  ;    12.  As a matter of fact,  His Majesty&apos;s &quot;Government,  so long as they hadin the Zone  the  necessary  forces,  would certainly act independently  for  thedefence of the  Canal if the  military situation required it,  whether  or  not  thetreaty  provided for it expressly. Moreover,  in practice, so long as the  allianceis  in operation and working well, there is not likely  to be  a serious difference;between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Egyptian Government over measures taken for  the protection of the Canal and the question whether His Majesty&apos;s,Government have   acted independently  or  not.   If,  however,  the  Egyptian:Government do not  challenge steps taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government, as beingunjustified because  taken independently, but, on the contrary,  approve them, it;would  be difficult for any of the other Suez Canal Powers to challenge them  onthis ground.&apos;   Consequently,  the express provision  about  independent action is\only likely to  be of any importance upon the  hypothesis that  Anglo-Egyptian-relations are bad, when it might be useful as a legal cloak for our action for  use against a third Power which was disposed  to challenge it.  In regard to an Egyptwith whom our relations were bad,  legal  considerations resulting from such atreaty  provision would  not be of practical importance.  Even  in  such an eventsome legal case could be made out for arguing that His Majesty&apos;s Government,even under the 1930 formula (which is what the Egyptians how want), had  not given up the right  of independent action,  and  that the words  &quot; with a  view to-ensuring in co-operation, with  the Egyptian forces the defence of the Canal&quot;did not mean that His Majesty&apos;s Government could only act  in co-operation withthe Egyptian forces.  For these reasons the point, in my opinion, is  not one  onwhich  we  should be justified in sacrificing  a treaty under which we should.obtain a permanent alliance, and  I  suggest that  Sir M. Lampson  should be instructed:that, in resuming,the negotiations, he need  not insist either upon the formula
 previously put forward, or on dealing with this point as a point of fundamental principle. (3) Alexandria.      13.   Egypt will not  agree to  a British right to  station troops at. or near Alexandria for an unlimited period of years.  But Nahas Pasha has admitted the possibility of our troops remaining in Alexandria  longer than in  Cairo.      14.   Nahas Pasha had already agreed to  improvement of road  and rail communications westward from the Canal  Zone, amounting practically  to  the construction of a  completely new system; and also to our liberty  of unlimited reinforcement in the Canal Zone  in the event of an apprehended emergency. These offers by His Excellency render the continued  occupation of Alexandria by British troops less necessary than hitherto.      15.   In a telegram (No. 263) of the 1st April the High Commissioner reported that the Commanders-in-chief  &quot; feel that even the provision for communications alone would be worth more than the retention of one battalion at Alexandria for an indefinite period.&quot;      16.   It should  also  be noted  that  even if  the  British  troops have left Alexandria they can under article 8 (see footnote on p. 2) be sent back there in the event of war or menace of  war.   Moreover, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs,  who is  Nahas Pasha&apos;s right-hand man and the most powerful influence in the Wafd, told the Acting High Commissioner on the 6th June  that  the Egyptians were fully prepared to  incorporate the &quot;  apprehended emergency&quot; formula (see footnote on p. 2) in article 8.  This would mean giving the right to send British troops to any part of  Egypt, including Alexandria, in the event of an &quot; apprehended emergency.&quot;                                  CONCLUSIONS.      17.   In view of the considerations set out above,!  recommend that Sir Miles Lampson should be instructed  to continue the discussions so far as the military clauses are  concerned upon the following basis :-      (1)  Egyptian  agreement should be secured to the  insertion in the treaty of            provisions to. secure a permanent alliance  on the lines  indicated  by .  ,         Nahas  Pasha and explained in paragraph  8 above. ,.&quot;:. -  (2)  His Majesty&apos;s  Governments  requirements in the matter of express            stipulations  for  (a) a  recognition  of  a British right to  military            occupation of  the Canal  Zone in perpetuity, (b) independent  action   .       .  by Great Britain for  the protection  of the Suez  Canal, should  be            abandoned.      (3)&apos;.  As regards Alexandria, His Majesty&apos;s Government should agree to  the            occupation oL the British forces being limited  to a fixed period  of ;           years..   :&apos;    . ::        &quot;   &apos;     -     :                       -      I fully realise that the  second  and third recommendations above involve &quot;a considerable departure from the previous Cabinet Conclusions on the matter, but A -wish, to emphasise that (1) a permanent alliance with the explicit corollary ^described by Nahas and his  colleagues offers an entirely new  possibility which has  never been  considered before, and in  my opinion  introduces a  fundamental difference into the  situation.                                                                        A. E.      June 8, 1936...r&quot;  -;- (3) It must be admitted that the 1930 formula is not satisfactory as  a cover for British :inartial law in the  Canal Zone (or at any rate unilateral.British martial law as opposed to martial /law declared jointly with Egypt).  On.the other hand, it. is obvious that, declaration  of British ; martial law in.the  Canal Zone not in co-operation with the Egyptian Government is a step which . would only be contemplated when there was an acute difference of opinion between the Egyptian Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government. In such circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government &apos; would no  doubt be/maintaining that  the Egyptian Government were not fulfilling the  provisions, of the treaty, and would base their declaration of martial law^ upon this fact, which they could say entitled the commander of the British foi-ces in Egypt no  longer  to hold himself bound by thev limitations of the treaty and entitled to exercise the powers of an  occupying  force.
