THE DATE FOR COMMENCEMENT OF PROVINCIAL AUTONOMY                (SIR OTTO NIEMEYER1S REPORT).       Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.     I wish to inform my colleagues  that, having consideredthe Report of sir Otto Nierneyer recently presented toparliament.(Cmd.5163), in the course of which he has statedas his opinion that &quot;from the financial point of view.............. His Majesty&apos;s Government may safely proposeto Parliament that Part III of the Government of India Act,1935, should he brought into operation a year hence&quot;,I propose to accept his views in this respect (in which theGovernment of India concur) and to carry out substantially the recommendations for the financial distribution betweenthe Centre and the Provinces contained in his Report.I am accordingly laying before Parliament on Tuesday, 26thMay, two draft Orders in Council, one of which will dealwith the financial distribution and the other will fix1st April, 1937, as the date for the commencement of Part iii of the Act,  -which, in fact, means the commencement of thewhole Act, other than the provisions of Part II relating tothe Federation.  There will also be  another Order fixing thesame date for the separation of Burma.
     I have,  of course,  in arriving at these  decisions,taken full account of the views of each of the  provinces and of the Government of India on the  Report, and I proposeto present along with the Orders a White Paper  containingthese views and. a telegram from myself to the Governmentof India indicating what has heen decided.                               Z..5th May, 1956.
