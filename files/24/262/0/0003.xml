(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 3  GOVERNMEN SECRET. CP.  11)5 (56) .                              CABINET.                        COMMITTEE  ON BROADCASTING.                                REPORT.       1.      At  their Meeting on  March  11th,  1936  (Cabinet  17  (36)       Conclusion 7),  the  Cabinet  had before  them a Memorandum  by the       Postmaster General  (CP.  24 (36))  covering a proof  of the  Report       of Lord Ullswater&apos;s Committee on  the future  of  the  broadcasting       service, together with  the  Observations by the  Board  of  Governors       of the  British  Broadcasting Corporation on that Report,  and       agreed  to  refer the Postmaster General&apos;s Memorandum to a Cabinet       Committee  composed  as follows :-                        The Chancellor  of the Exchequer,                        The Secretary of State for Home Affairs,                        The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,                        The Minister of  Health,                        The President of the  Board of Education,                        The First Commissioner of  Works,                        The Postmaster General.       As arranged at  the  same Meeting of the  Cabinet, the Report  of       Lord  Ullswater&apos;s Committee  was subsequently  presented to       Parliament on the 16th  March as Cmd. Paper 5091.COPY NO. (j^y
2.     As pointed out in C,P0 24 (36) the outstandingfeatures of the Report of Lord Ullswater&apos;s Committee arethe unanimous recognition that the constitution of theBritish Broadcasting Corporation has worked well, and the&apos;complete endorsement of the Corporations general policyand activities.  We agree with the Committee and thePostmaster General in thinking that there should he no&apos;radical change in the existing system and that any modifi-cations should he directed to strengthening and securing that system,3.     It will he necessary in the near future for thePostmaster General to make a statement in the House ofCommons on the views of the Government on the Ullswater ReportFor the purpose of this statement decisions are required ona number of points, including those specifically raised inC.P. 24 (36).   We have examined these points and reached thefollowing conclusions upon them:MATTERS AFFECTING THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE corporation and GOVERNMENT.(a) The new Charter of the Corporation.       We think it very important that Ministerial controlover the preparation of the new Charter should he fullyretained, and that the draft Charter should not he submittedto the Board of Governors of the B.B.C. until after its texthas been approved by the Cabinet.  We do not contemplate thatits terms should be the subject of negotiation with the Board                                                 and licenceof Governors.    The preparation of a draft new Charter/willbe undertaken as soon as the Cabinet have reached decisions on our recommendations-.    We propose to examine this draft and in due  course to circulate it in the form adqpted  by usto the Cabinet  for approval.
 (&quot;b) Period  of Extension  of Corporation&apos; s Charter.      We agree with the Ullswater Committee and the Postmaster  General that  the period of extension of the Charter should he 10 years and not 20 years as advocated by the Oorporati on,      We see great advantage to all concerned, including the Corporation, in  the hew  Charter receiving the approval of the House of Commons without a Division, and it is clear that this can only be secured if the period of duration is limited to 10 years.   Moreover, as pointed out in C,P* 24 (36) &quot;the power entrusted to the Corporation is enormous and no-one can foresee the developments, technical, political, and social, which may occur in the course of the next 10 years.  Changes may be needed by the end  of 10 years,  and it is easier to make a new Charter to replace  one that has  expired than to break in upon a Charter which.has several more years to run&quot;. (c) Number  of Governors.      We agree with the Postmaster General that the arguments adduced by  the Corporation in favour of a smaller Board are not sufficiently strong to justify the rejection of the Ullswater Committee&apos;s recommendation that the number of Governors should be increased to  seven.      We also recommend  that the new Charter should repeat the present provision enabling the number of Governors to be further increased by Order in Council,   This power may never have to be used, but it would be valuable to have it in reserve in case at some future time it was found necessary, for various reasons,  to increase the number above seven.      We agree with the Postmaster General that it would be advantageous to reappoint some of the present Governors so as to secure continuity of administration.    The term of appointment of future Governors should be for not more than 5 years.
 (d) Remuneration of Governors.    ----------------  -  -       ..       Chairman  and               ;      We think that the remuneration of/Governors should he laid down  in the Charter and that the respective amounts should he as  recommended in the Report of the Ullswater Committee,      In the  course of his statement in the House of Commons,, the Postmaster General should emphasise the  importance which the Government attach to the duties and responsibilities of the Chairman  and other members of the Board  of Governors. The functions and responsibilities of the Chairman are such as normally to occupy most of his time, and his salary of  3000 per annum has reference to this consideration. (e) Government JJontrol and Ministerial Responsibility.      The Ullsv/ater Committee recommend that the extent of the control exercised by the Government over the Corporation&apos;s activities should continue as  it is - at present but that Ministerial responsibility for exercising that control should be divided between the Postmaster General, who in future would be concerned solely with technical control under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts (together with the administration of the wireless licence system, the collection of revenue, and the investigation of complaints of electrical interference) and a Cabinet Minister in the House of Commons free from, heavy departmental duties and preferably a senior member of the Government.      We think this latter suggestion is open to serious objection.     It appears to be based on the misconception that &quot;the responsibility for the cultural side&quot; should rest with some minister  &quot;who should supervise policy and direct its destinies&quot;.   (Para.  53 of Report).      In our view,  however,  responsibility for -these mattersmust rest with the  Corporation and it would be entirelycontrary to  the policy establishing the B.B.C. to transfer toa Minister  responsibility  for broadcasting, either generally                       -4-
or in matters of detail.  It cannot be seriously suggestedthat if the Minister objected on cultural or similar grounds to particular items in the programme he should have a rightof veto, possibly after reference to the Cabinet^      The Ullswater Committee no doubt had in mind difficultieswhich have arisen in the past where the Government on one ortwo occasions wished to interfere with arrangements already made by the Corporation.   These, however, have been matters connected with foreign affairs, and it has been for theCabinet as a whole to reach decisions upon them.   The PrimeMinister has then informed the Postmaster General of thedecision, who in turn communicated it to the Corporation,,There seems to us no sufficient reason why this procedure should be changed.      We favour the continuance as at present by thePostmaster General of his existing functions, but we feelthat the question is one for the Cabinet to decide,and we accordingly make no specific recommendation upon it.(f) Finance.      We recommend that the Licence fee should remain at 10/-as at present.      We are of opinion that the initial assignment to theCorporation of 75 per cent, of the net Licence revenue is fully justified.   Having regard, moreover, to the future needsof Television and Empire broadcasting services, we do not dissent from the  view that the Corporation hrve a case forsome increase of  revenue.    The arrangements proposed by theUllswater Committee,  namely that the balance of 25 per cent.of the net Licence revenue should be potentially available                         -5-
for the needs Of &quot;broadcasting,  seem to us  unduly favourable to the Corporation, and would,  we are sure,  be severely criticised in the House of Commons.   An alternative wording-suggested by the Treasury (see  end of paragraph 4 of.Po 24 (36)) also seems to us  open to objection on theground of vagueness.      In our view the financial position should be closelydefined and we accordingly recommend :         That the Charter should provide for         the assignment to the  Corporation of         75 per cent, of the net Licence         revenue, and that there should be         added a carefully worded provision         (to be settled in consultation with         the Treasury) to the effect that it         will be possible for the Corporation         to secure such an increase of revenue         beyond this 75 per cent, as the         Treasury, having regard to the require-         Reinforcements of Television and Empire broad-         casting and other services conducted by         the Corporation, may approve.(S) The Future Status of the CentraI Council for School    Broadcasting and the Scottish Sub-Council.        The Ullswater Committee&apos;s proposal is that these bodies, to which the Corporation has hitherto entrusted thedirection of the programmes transmitted weekly for schools,should be given independent status with power to determine the school educational programme to be broadcast, and the ancillary leaflets and pamphlets to be issued.   In our view the fundamental responsibility for allocating broadcastingtime to this service must rest  with the Corporation, and this service must be financed out of the Corporation&apos;s share ofthe Licence revenue.   In these circumstances the true stand-ing of the Councils, however established,  must be that ofagents of the Corporation empowered to act with completediscretion within limits define d by the Corporation, and,as the Corporation itself agrees, subject to the overridingresponsibility of the Corporation.
(h) Empire Broadcasting.      We agree with the recommendation that in future thedevelopment of Empire broadcasting should be regarded asan important normal function of the broadcasting organisation,and that this service, as well as Television broadcasting,should be expressly authorised in the new Charter.      The additional funds required for the development of empire broadcasting will be provided by the Corporation fromits increased share of the Licence revenue.   The finance of television broadcasting, on the other hand, is to be re-examined in the autumn of this year in the light of experiencewhich will then be available, and can then be considered inconsultation with the Treasury as contemplated in (f) above,      At the request of the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, who has undertaken to look into the matter, wehave reserved for later consideration the question of theuse in Empire broadcasting of languages other than English.( i) PT-gseirtati^n-of^sj^imates of Revenue and Expenditure.      We assume that the duty of presenting the estimates for broadcasting will remain with the Postmaster General, andwe share the view of the Ullswater Committee that thesoEstimates should be presented separately from the Post OfficeEstimates.   The separate presentation by  the Minister ofLabour of the Estimate for the Unemployment Assistance board is a precedent for this course.( 3)  Estimates of Capital Expenditure.      With the exception of Sir William McLintock, who madea reservation on this point, the members of the UllswaterCommittee considered, that the opportunity  of&quot; the annualBroadcasting Estimate should be taken to inform Parliament andthe public of the major items of capital expenditure contem-plated in the ensuing year.   We make no recommendation on thismatter, which in our view should be left for the Chancellorof the Exchequer to determine, in consultation with thePostmaster General.
     (k) ^Spqnsored&quot; . Items -     Tlie view of the Ullsv/ater Committee was that &quot;sponsored&quot;items might &quot;be included in television programmes with the specificintention that the revenue obtained from these items should beapplied towards the probably high cost of Television in the early stages of its development.   The Chancellor of the Exchequerinforms us that he attaches no great importance to the financial aspects of this subject.   Its advertising aspects do not commendthemselves to us, in view of the considerations which we are about to develop under the next heading, and we accordingly recommend that &quot;sponsored&quot; items should not be allowed a     (1) &quot;---el ay Exchange s.     The proposal of the Ullsv/ater Committee is that the relayexchanges which exist in some parts of the country,  and whichare operated by private companies under licence from thePostmaster General, should be acquired and operated by the postOffice, and that their programmes should come under the controlof the B.B.C.   The opportunity of making the change would occur                                                                   B                                                                   won the expiration of the present licences,  on December 3,1st, 1936, 1but a short extension of licence would no doubt have to be givento the companies in order to enable the Post Office and the B.B.C. Eto gain experience of the technique of wire broadcasting.     We have given this proposal very full and careful consideration!                                                                   1and v/e do not think it necessary to trouble the Cabinet with thearguments for and against the transfer of the Relay Services fromthe control and management of private enterprise to that of some form of public control, or with the technical and other considerations which have been submitted to us.                                                                   I     v/e are satisfied that in the present state of developmentof broadcasting,  the relay system has obvious advantages in     \   fcertain areas and that it could not and should not be abolished.
     We have unanimously rejected as impracticahle any suggestion that the Post Office should forthwith take over the ownership and operation of the relay system.   For various reasons it seems undesirable to&quot;reach a definite decision atthe present time on the question whether the relay system should he transferred at some later date to the post office or not.   The postponement of a definite decision on thisquestion will give time for experience to be gained and experimental work, theoretical and practical, to be undertakenand should also enable a more correct estimate to be formed asto the probable lines of future development in broadcastingthan is possible at present.     Subject as stated in the following paragraph we recommendthat extensions of licences should be granted to existing relayundertakings and licences should be granted to new undertakingsapplying for them, terminable in all cases not later than the31st December 1939, i.e. three years after the present licencesexpire on the 31st December 1936.   It must be made clear toall existing and new licensees that the Government retaincomplete freedom of action as from the 31st December 1959, andthat there can be no commitment of any sort to the relay under-takings after that date.   The provision entitling the Govern-ment, on expiry of the licence, to take over installations on&quot;Tramway Terms&quot; would remain.   In the meantime we recommendthat the post office should undertake theoretical research and practical experimental work,     We recommend that in addition to the present terms and provisions, conditions to.the following effect should be inserted in all new licences and extensions of licencess-     (a) the relay services must reach a reasonable standard         of efficiency in technical and other respects^     (b) undertakings which provide the choice of two programmes         must supply one B..B.G.  programme at least  during B.B.G.         hours.There are at present  a number of undertakings  which can  only
relay one programme to their subscribers.    We have  requested the Postmaster General to ascertain whether it is technicallypracticable for these undertakings, without crippling them-selves financially, to make arrangements to give theirsubscribers the choice of two programmes.    If so, we are disposed to think that these undertakings might be given areasonable period, say three months, in which to make thenecessary changes and it would then be obligatory upon them alsoto give their subscribers a choice of two programmes, of whichduring B.B.C. hours one at least must be the B.B.C.  programme.     Pending further enquiry by the Postmaster General we havedeferred making any definite recommendation to the Cabinet onthis particular matter.     The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and thePostmaster General while not dissenting from the conclusionswe have reached wish it to be placed on record that  they themselves would have preferred that a definite decision shouldhave been taken now to transfer the relay system to  the PostOffice at some later date,say the end of 1939.     We have most carefully examined the difficult question ofthe practice of the relay undertakings in relaying &quot; advert is ement&quot;programmes, i.e. programmes provided by British firms which include advertisements of their goods, from certain foreignstations.   After careful consideration we are satisfied that itwould be unwise to prohibit the relaying of these advertisementprogrammes, partly on the ground that they afford to  relajrsubscribers an alternative to the B.B.C. programme, especially on Sundays, which owners of the best reception sets can alwayssecure at will.     We think however that some step should be taken  to limit the growth of what we deem to be an undesirable feature,  and
we accordingly recommend that the Postmaster General shouldhe authorised to make a statement to the following effect tothe representatives of the relay undertakings, it being understood that this statement is equally applicable to existing undertakings and to any new undertakings that mayhereafter come into beings-     nIn granting on certain conditions the extension of      the licensing system to the 31st December 1939, the      Government are anxious not to fetter the discretion of      the relay undertakings in regard to their programmes      apart from the requirements that during B.B.C. hours      at least one B.B.C. programme must be relayed.      At the same time the Government see very great      objection to the growth of advertising in certain      programmes relayed from abroad.   The Government      hope that those responsible for relay undertakings      will bear in mind this expression of opinion, as,      if the advertising practice grows to scandalous      proportions, the Government may have to take      drastic action in regard to it.&quot;(m) Broadcasting of Official Notices.     The Ullswater Committee recommended (para. 54) that theCorporation should have a discretionary power to announce thatany given official notice is broadcast at the request of anamed Department.   In their observations the Corporation statethat they &quot;asked that specific instructions (e.g. the introduc-tion or the veto of an item) should be announced as such andbelieves that this is what the Committee intended to recommend&quot;.     We agree with the recommendation of the Ullswater committee but reject the interpretation which the Corporation have placed upon it.   There are cases in which the statement that an itemis vetoed might imply the very conclusion which it  is againstthe public interest to create.   We accordingly recommend that          ox* JJI,ccncGthe Charter/should contain provisions to the following effects-     (1) The Corporation to have a discretionary power         to announce that any official notice is broad-         cast at the request of a named Department.     (2) The Corporation shall not make an announcement         that an item has been cancelled at  the request         of a Department except with the express  consent         of the  Department  concerned..
liATTERSJpFECTINGBHEINTERNALfcD-ilNIS-JRATION OPfHS B.B.C. (n) Poreign Broadcasting in English.      The Ullswater Committee (para. 114) stated that they &quot;understand that the Post Office and the Foreign Office take all the steps which are within their power with a view to preventing the broadcasting from foreign countries in English of programmes which include advertisements and to which objection has been taken.   We approve this policy, but it is obvious that co-operation with all foreign countries is necessary to make the policy internationally effective&quot;. Successive Governments have approved this policy which, it will be observed, is based on collective action.   We recommend its confirmation and continuance. (o) Electrical Interfgrencg.      The Ullsjater Committee recommended that the technical investigation of interference with broadcasting reception should be expedited, and compulsory limiting powers sought if necessary.   We recommend acceptance of these suggestions. 4.    Broadly speaking the view we take of these matters affecting the internal administration of the B.B.C. is that the conclusions which the Cabinet reach in regard to them could most suitably be conveyed to the Corporation in the course of a private conversation between the Postmaster General and representatives of the Corporation.   On the other hand we think it imperative that the Government should be informed of the decisions which the Corporation propose to take in regard to these matters before&apos;the forthcoming Parliamentary Debate.      In regard to certain of these matters it is much to be hoped that the Corporation will  adopt a reasonable attitude.Unless they do so there may be  real danger of serious  and far-reaching Parliamentary criticism.
(1) Wales.      The Ullswater Committee recommended that wales should as soon as possible be constituted as a distinctbroadcasting region.   They urged that every effort shouldbe made to solve certain technical difficulties and tosatisfy the demands of the Welsh people with the minimum of delay, and they recommended in Wales, as in other parts,an increasing devolution of programme control and anincrease in the broadcasting material of regional origin,performance and interest.   They also favoured theestablishment of a general advisory Committee for the welsh Region and. the continuance or creation of AdvisoryCommittees on special subjects linked with the appropriateCentral Committees,      We recommend the acceptance of the UllswaterCommittee&apos;s recommendation on the subject of the special needs of Wales, and we trust that the Postmaster general will be able to obtain an assurance from the Corporationthat they also accept those recommendations and will do their best to implement them.(2) Staff Questions.    (a) Recruitment.   The Ullswater Committee, afterstating thj t the time has come when recruitment should besystematised, recommended that the positions to be filledshould be advertised and that appointments (except those of minor staff) should be made on the recommendation of a selection Board comprising officials of the B.B.C.,together with one of&quot; the Civil Service Commissioners or their Representative, and possibly an independentadditional  member.      We recommend acceptance of these recommendations,and we suggest  that the Postmaster General  at hisconference  with the Corporation should give the latter9                     -13-
every opportunity of voluntarily accepting the Government&apos;views on this matter.   If, however, no such assurance wasforthcoming, it would he necessary for him to inform theCorporation that the Government would have to insist onacceptance of the recommendations., subject, only if serious                                      the dropping ofobjection was raised by the Corporation, to/the suggestionthat &quot;an independent additional member&quot; should be added tothe Selection Board.    (b)  Staff Representation.   We agree with the recommend-ation of the Ullswater Committee thtt the Corporation shouldmake it  clear that it will provide all necessary facilitiesfor any representative organisation, whether a single staffassociation or similar bodies representative of appropriategroups,  which its employees may wish to set up.   here again it is very desirable that before the House of commons debate takes place the Government should have received an assurance from the Corporation in regard to this matter.       We also agree with the Ullswater  omit tee inrejecting, as in the circumstances impracticable, represent-ation in the form of the intervention of external TradeUnions.    (c)  Controversial, etc. Activities.  We&apos; understandthat the Corporation have already implemented the UllswaterCommittee&apos;s suggestion that the staff concerned withprogramme work should follow the general tradition of theCivil Service in refraining from any prominent part inmatters of controversy by applying to such officials a rule on the lines of that operative in the Civil  Service.      The Ullswater Committee added that &quot;apart from this we consider the staff should be free from any control bythe Corporation over their private lives&quot;.   We t-hinkthat this formula is hardly comprehensive enough, andwe favour the addition of a phrase to the effect that such                   -14-
lapses should only he overlooked so long as they did not affect the value of the individual&apos;s work.( 3) Advisory Committees*      We agree generally with the recommendations of theUllswater Committee in regard to the Advisory Council andGommittees,  While we do not favour insistence on rigiduniformity in this matter, we hope that the Corporation willhe able to give an assurance that they are favourable inprinciple to the recommendations, and will endeavour so faras may be practicable to realise them in practice.   Inparticulrr we think that the Corporation should make everyeffort to re-establish Advisory Committees in those areas where failures have occurred.
 (4)    Editorial Commento      The  Ullswater Committee make no specific recommendation on this  matter hut we recommend that the&apos;Postmaster-General  should draw the attention of the Corporation to their  obligation to refrain from editorial comment not only during the actual broadcasting  programmes but also  in the &quot;Listener&quot; and other BoBoCo  publications.    In dealing with news5  the Corporation&apos;: s duty is strictly to record facts.    It  should have no opinion or policy of its own.      We also recommend  the inclusion in the Corporation&apos;sCharter or Licence of a  prohibition against editorialcomment in publications  as well as broadcast programmes. (5)    Payment to Authors.      In paragraph 72 of their report the Ullswater Committee favour settlement of disputes by reference to an agreed  Arbitration  Tribunal but add &quot;if agreement as  to arbitration cannot be reached9 we recommend that the question should be decided by a Tribunal set  up by Parliament for the purpose&quot;. We see great objection  to  this latter suggestion and no action appears to us to be nebessary, except that the Postmaster-General should be authorised - to ascertain the views  of the Corporation on the U11s wa te r C ommittee&apos;s p r op o s a1s.
( 6 )    Accounts, -     In their Observations the Corporation claim thatthey have presented their 1935 accounts in the slightlymodified form suggested in the Ullswater Report.   Wehave invited the  Postmaster-General to ascertain whether his Department are satisfied with the accountsin their new form.   If further action proves to be necessary ,  we think that he should obtain an assurance from the Corporation that his requirements in thisrespect will be met.   The point, howevers is not one which need be provided for in the Charter.(7)    Wireless R.eceivinp; Sets.     The UHswater Committee recommended that theCorporation and the wireless trade should jointlyexamine the possibility of examining and putting onsale at a low price a standard receiving set.     We recommend that the Postmaster-General should ascertain the views of the Corporation in regardto this proposal.
5o   Our Conclusions&apos; and. recommendations may be summarisedas follows : -(i)  It will be necessary in  the near future       for the Postmaster-General to make a       statement in the House of Commons of       the views of the Government on the       Ullswater Report.    For the purposes of       this state lent decisions are required on       the following matters affecting both the       relations between the Corporation and the       Government and also matters of internal       administration and management falling       mainly outside the scope of Government       action.MATTERS AFFECTING THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE           CORPORATION AND GOVERNMENT,(a)  The new Charter of the Corporation.        Ministerial control over the preparation     of the new Charter should be fully maintained     and the draft Charter should not be submitted     to the Corporation until its text had been     approved by the Cabinet.    Its terms should     not be the subject of negotiation with the     Corporation ^. The,epreparation of a draft     new Charter/will be undertaken as soon as the     Cabinet have reached decisions on our recommenda     tions.   Copies of this draff, in the form     adopted by us,  will be circulated in due course     to the Cabinet for approvalo(b)  Period of Extension of Corporation&apos;s Charter.     The period of extension of the Charter should     be ten years.( G )  Number of Governors.        The number of Governors should be increased     to seven and the new Charter should repeat     the present provision enabling the number of     Governors to be further increased by Order-in-     Councll.        It will be advantageous to re-appoint some     of the present Governors so as to secure con-     discontinuity of administration0  The term of appoint-     ment of future Governors should be for not more     than five years,( d )  Remuneration of Governors.                         Chairman and        The  remuneration of/Governors should be     laid down in the Charter and the respective     amounts should be as recommended in the Report     of the  Ullswater Committee.
9 ft        In the course of his statement in the House of     Commons the Postmaster--General should emphasise     the importance which the Government attach to     the duties and responsibilities of the Chairman     and other members of the Board of Governors.     The functions and responsibilities of the Chairman     are such as normally to occupy most of his time     and his salary of  3,000 per annum has reference     to this Consideration,,(e)  Government Control and Ministerial Responsibility0        For the reasons set out on pages 4- and 5     of our Report, we favour the continuance as at     present by the Postmaster-General of his existing     functions and we are opposed to the suggestion     of the Ullswater Committee that the Postmaster-     General should share his responsibility with a     Cabinet Minister in the House of Commons free     from heavy Departmental duties and preferably     a senior member of the Government.    This question,     however,  is in our opinion one for the Cabinet     to decide and we accordingly make no specific     recommendation upon it.(f)  Finance.        The licence fee should remain at ten shillings     as at present.        In our opinion the initial assignment to the     Corporation of 75 per cent,  of the net licence     revenue is fully justified,  and in view of the     future needs of Television and Empire Broadcasting     Services we do not dissent from the view that     the Corporation have a case for some increase     of revenue.     We accordingly recommend that the     Charter should provide for the assignment to the     Corporation of 75 per cent,  of the net licence     revenue and that there should be added a carefully-     worded provision  to be settled in consultation     with the Treasury  to the effect that it will     be possible for the Corporation to secure such     an increase of revenue beyond this 75 per cent.     as the Treasury,  having regard, to the requirements     of Television and Empire Broadcasting and other     services conducted by the Corporation, may approve.
(s)  The Future Status of the__Central Council     for School Broadcasting and the., Scottish        In our vie?/ the fundamental responsibility     for allocating broadcasting time to this     service must rest with the Corporation, and     this service must be financed out of the     Corporations share of the Licence revenue.     The true standing of the Councils, however     established, must be that of agents of the     Corporation empowered to act with complete     discretion within certain limits defined by     the Corporation and as the Corporation itself     agrees, subject to the over-riding responsibility     of the Corporation.(h)  Empire Broadcasting.        The development of Empire broadcasting should     be regarded as an important normal function of     the broadcasting organisation, and this service     as Well as television broadcasting should be     expressly authorised in the new Charter.   The     additional funds required will be provided     by the Corporation from its increased share     of Licence revenue.        The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs     is examining the- question of the use in Empire     broadcasting of languages other than English.     We have accordingly reserved this point for     later consideration.(1)  Presentation of Estimates of Revenue ard Expenditure.        On the assumption that the duty of presenting     estimates for broadcasting will remain with     the Postmaster-General, these estimates  should be     presented separately from the Post Office estimates.(J)  Estimates, of Capital Expenditure.        We make no recommendation on this point which,     in our view, should be left for the Chancellor     of the Exchequer to determine in consultation     with the Postmaster-General.(k)  &quot;Sponsored&quot; items.        &quot;Sponsored&quot;  items should not be allowedt(1)   Relay Exchanges.     (1) Any suggestion that the  POst Office should     forthwith take over the  ownership and operation     of the relay system should  be rejected.     (2) For various reasons it is undesirable  to     reach a definite  decision at the  present  time     on the question whether  the relay system  should     be transferred at some later date to the  Post     Office or not.   The postponement of a definite     decision on this  question will give  time  for    . experience to be  gained  and experimental  work     undertaken and should also  enable a  more  correct     estimate to be formed as to probable lines  of     development than  is possible at present,
(3)     Subject to stated in(4) below, extensione of licences    may be granted to existing relay undertakings and    licences may be granted to new undertakings to be    terminable in all cases not later than 31st December,    1939, i.e. three years after the present licences    expire..   It must be made clear to all existing and    new licensees that the Government retain complete    liberty of action as from 31st December, 1939.    In the meantime the Post Office should undertake    research and experimental work.(4)     In addition to the present terms and provisions,    conditions to the following effect should be    inserted in all new licences and extensions of    licences:    (a) The relay services must reach a reasonable        standard of efficiency in technical and        other respects.    (b) Undertakings which provide the choice of two        programmes must supply one B.B.C. programme        at least during B.B.C. hours,NOJJg,-  In the case of existing relay undertakings,       which at present only relay a single programme,       the Postmaster-General is ascertaining whether       it would be technically practicable for the       undertaking concerned, without crippling itself       financially, to make arrangements to give their       subscribers the choice of two programmes.       If so the undertaking might be given a reasonable       pieriod in which to make the necessary changes       and it might then be made obligatory upon the       undertaking to give its subscribers the choice       of two programmes of which,  during B.B.C. hours       one at least would be the B.B.G. programme.       We defer making any recommendation on this       matter until we receive a Report from the       Postmaster-General.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and the Postmaster-General, while notdissenting from Conclusions 2-4 aboveinclusive, wish it to be placed on record that they would: have preferred that adefinite decision should, have been taken nowto transfer the relay system to the PostOffice at some later date, say the end of1939..,(5)     The Postmaster-General should make a statement    to the following effect to the representatives of    the relay undertakings.   This statement would    apply equally to existing undertakings and to new    undertakings:-        In granting on certain conditions the extension        of the licensing system to 31st December, 1939,        the Government are anxious not to fetter the        discretion of the relay undertakings in regard to        their programmes, apart from the requirement that        during B.B.C. hours at least one B.B.C. programme        must be relayed.        At the same time the Government see very great        objection to the growth of advertising in certain        programmes relayed from abroad.   The Government        hope that those responsible for relay under-        takings will carefully bear in mind this expression        of opinion, as, if the advertising practice grows        to scandalous proportions, the Government may have        to take drastic action in regard to it.                  -21-
(m) Broadcasting of Official Notices,       The Charter should contain the  following    provisions:-               (i) The Corporation to  have a                  discretionary power  to announce                  that any official notice is  broad-                  cast at the request  of a named                  Department.              (ii) The Corporation shall not make                  an announcement that an item has                  been cancelled at the request of                  a Department except  with the                  express consent of the department^tment                  concerned.(n) Foreign Broadcasting in English.       The policy which has been approved by    successive Governments in this matter should    be confirmed and continued.(0) Electrical Interference.       The technical investigation of  the inter-    ference of broadcasting reception  should be    expedited j. and compulsory limiting powers    sought if necessary.MATTERS AFFECTING THE INTERNAL ADMINISTRATION OF               THE B.B.C.    The Conclusions reached by the Cabinet in    regard to the following matters could most    suitably be conveyed to the Corporation in    the course of discussion between the Postmaster    General -and representatives of the Corporation,    It is imperative that the Government should be    informed of the decisions taken by the    Corporation in regard to these matters before    the forthcoming Parliamentary Debate    (1) Wales.         The Ullswater Committee&apos;s recommendations        on the subject of the special needs of        Wales should be accepted,  and the Postmaster        General should endeavour to obtain an        assurance from the Corporation that they        also accept those recommendations and will        do their best to implement them.    (2) Staff Questions.        (a) Recruitment.  The Ullswater Committee&apos;&apos;s        recommendations should be accepted and the        Corporation should be given every opportunity        of voluntarily acquiescing in the Government\s        views on the matter.  If,  however, no such        assurance can be obtained, the Postmaster-        General should inform the Corporation that        the Government must insist on the acceptance        of the recommendations subject only, if        serious objection is raised by the Corporation,
to the omission of the suggestion thatan independent additional member shouldbe added to the Selection Board.(b) Staff Representation.  While represent- -ation involving the intervention of external Trade Unions is undesirable, theCorporation should make it clear that itwill provide all necessary facilities forany representative organisation, whether asingle staff association or similar bodiesrepresentative of appropriate groups, which its employees may wish to set up.   an assurance to this effect should be obtained before the Debate in the House of Commonstakes place.(c) Controversial, etcc Activities.   TheCorporation have already adopted the suggest-ion that a ruling on the lines of thatoperative in the Civil Service will beapplied to their own staff in regard torefraining from taking any prominent partin matters of controversy.    The Ullswater Committee&apos;s formula &quot;Apartfrom this we consider the staff  should be free from any control by the Corporation over their private lives&quot; should be made more comprehensive by the addition of a phraseto the effect that lapses will only be over-looked so long as they do not affect thevalue of the individual&apos;s work.3)   Advisory Committees.        The Ullswater Committee&apos;s recommendations    should be accepted in principle,  and it is    hoped that the Corporation will be able to    give an assurance that they regard these    recommendations with favour and will endeavour,    so fir  as may be practicable, to realise them    in practice.    In particular the  Corporation    should make every effort to re-establish    Advisory Committees  in those areas where    failures have occurred.-) Editorial Comment.        The Postmaster General  should draw the    attention of the Corporation to their    obligation to refrain from  editorial  comment,    not only during the actual  broadcasting    programmes,  but also in their publications.    There should also  be included in the    Corporation&apos;s Charter or Licence&apos;a prohibition    against editorial  comment in publication  as    well as broadcast  programmes.
( 5)  Payment to Authors.        The Postmaster General should, ascertain    the views of the Corporation on the  Ullswater    Committee&apos;s suggestions,  hut beyond  this    no action appears to be called for.(5)  Accounts.       The Postmaster General v/ill ascertain    whether his Department are satisfied with    the steps which the Corporation have taken    to amplify their accounts in the direction    recommended by the Ullswater Committee.    If the Department are not satisfied, an    assurance should be obtained from the    Corporation that the requirements of the    Post Office in this respect will be  met.    The matter is not one which need be  specially    provided for in the Charter.(7)  Wireless Receiving Sets.       The Postmaster General will ascertain    the views of the Corporation on the    Ullswater Committee&apos;s proposal that  the    B.B,C* and the wireless trade should    jointly examine the possibility of putting    on sale at a low fixed price a standard    receiving set.Signed on behalf of the committee, Whitehall Gardens,27th April,  1936.S.W..1.JOHN SIMONCHAIRMAN.
