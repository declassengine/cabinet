DRAFTSEC R EOfficees of the Cabinet,Ref. NOo2,  Whitehall Gardens,  S.W61.June, 1936.Dear Sir,          With reference to your letter of the 11th June, 193 6,in reply to my conraunication of the 29th May, I am directed by the Prime Minister to state that the Cabinet havetaken note of the undertaking given in the last paragraphof your letter, namely, that the-British broadcasting corporation is prepared to accept the suggestion containedin my letter and to agree that, in future, no reference willbe made in the Hews Bulletins to happenings at CahinetMeetings unless by arrangement with the Government PressOfficer or other responsible authority.I am, Six1,Your obedient Servant,. G. No rman, Esc,,   Chairman of the        British Broadcasting Corporation,              Broadcasting House,                    Portland Place,  W6i.
                                 Offices of  the Cabinet,                                   2, Whitehall Gardens,                                           * &apos;W * 1 aS E OR IT T.                                    29th May, 1936.Dear Mr. Norman,        In  the  absence of  the Postmaster-General who  isaway from London  to-day, the Prime Minister has instructedme to address you on  the following matter.        The Cabinet this morning had  their attention  called to an item  in the News Bulletin of the British. broadcasting corporation last  Wednesday night to the effect that theCabinet meeting on Wednesday morning was understood to havehad before  it the Report of the Tribunal which has beeninvestigating the alleged Budget leakage,  and that this report was then considered by the Cabinet.   I ami instructed to write to you about this, for inasmuch as Cabinet meetingsare secret  ana  the proceedings at them are known to none butmembers of  the Caoi.net, such an announcement, in the absenceof express  authorisation, must represent either a leakageor ,:. n invention.   It is, of course,  appreciated that thestatement was not a positive assertion but was introduced by the phrase &quot;It is understood&quot;, but I am sure you will appreciate  that the great majority of hearers cannot beexpected to draw  these fine distinctions,  and in fact theimpression produced is that a piece of news about what passed at the Cabinet meeting is being conveyed.        I am to say that the Government are bound to takea serious view of statements in an item of news broadcastby the British Broadcasting Corporation as to what issupposed to have passed in the secrecy of  a Cabinet meeting,and they feel confident that the British broadcasting corporation will agree that the mere  fact  that a number ofanonymous journalists publish statements to the same effect                        -1-
is no reason for giving it the aclaecl authority of circula-tion thus involved.   In fact there was not a syllableof truth in the statement, but the principle ones not depend on that.   I am to suggest, as a precaution againstthe repetition of such an incident, that the rule should be definitely laid down that no reference should be made inthe News Bulletin to what is supposed to have been passed at a Cabinet meeting, unless special and uirect authorityfor the statement has been obtained by the british broadcasting Corporation from No. 10, Downing Street.The Prime Minister will be glad to hear- from you that thissuggestion has been adopted and will be put into forcehenceforward.                   Yours sincerely,                       (Signed)   M.P.A.  EANKEY.R.C. Norman, Escp.,   Chairman of the       British Broadcasting Corporation,             Broadcasting Ho use.                  Portlaaia Place,  VV.1.
11th June, 1936.Dear  Sir Maurice Hankey,      The Governors  have now had an opportunity of considering your letter  of Hay  29th,  to which an acknowledgment was sent on June 2nd.Before  I reply to the suggestion you make they hope you will &quot;bearwith  ;:ie if i deal in some  detail with your letter,      The Governors  see no  reason why any question should arise asto  the  propriety of the Frine Z.&apos;inistor coranuhieating with theCorporation directly through you ana not through the Postnastor-General .   If  it was intended to issue a formal instruction under clause  4 of the Corporation&apos;s Licence, the Fostoaster-General -would presumably he  the channel  of communication.   But in this case wedo not  understand that that is the  intention.    The Corporation is constantly la  cor.miuni cation with Government Departments and if itwere  the rule  that Ministers  could  only  comaunicate via thePostmaster-General  (who in  most cases  would have no first-handknowledge of the subject),  the  valuable  and harmonious  relations which normally exist between  the  Corporation and. the departments would be seriously handicapped.     This matter; for instance,  we  feel  could  have been readilyand. happily settled in a telephone  conversation between yourselfand- the Director-General or Controller of the  programme Division,.or between Mr.  Steward and  the  Chief Hews Editor.     In case you have not seen it,  we  enclose  copies of an exchangeof &quot;correspondence between the  Home  Office and  the  B.B.C.  on the same subject as that on which you wrote.    we  attach also a  copy of whatcane over the tapes.     The facts  are these.   The news  item  broadcast was  a cautiousand reduced version of what was  received  on the  Agencies&apos;  tapes,and was preceded by words which made it plain  that  there  was  noB.B.C. authority behind it.  There was 210 &quot;invention11 by the  B.3.C.and. no suggestion of &quot;leakage&quot;..  The Chief Hews  Editor  &quot;had noreason to doubt its accuracy until  about  10 p.n. when Iir.  Stewardlodged a complaint by telephone and-  said,  he had  twice denied  the story to the  Press Association.  Ho  correction,  however,  had.  come over the tapes, although subsequently  there was  a  statement that theprijrted report  was not  ready but that  the  Home Secretary  had.comnunicated  the Tribunal findings to  the Cabinet.
     As the result of Mr, Steward1 s call the item was dropped from subsequent summaries.  Had he rung up our News department at the same time as he spo. :e (apparently ineffectively) to the agencies the item w ould, of course, have &quot;been omitted-, from thebulletin, or, if his message had  come after the First News, adementi would have been issued in the Second,.     Naturally the inaccuracy of  the statement is regretted, but the Governors are surprised at the implication that there was anyirresponsibility.   They had believed that the B.B.C1s sense ofresponsibility in affairs of national importance, as reflected inits News Bulletins, was established and generally accepted.     Whenever there is any doubt  as to the accuracy of an item of news concerning the Government, it is the invariable customof -the News Department to get in  touch with the GovernmentDepartment concerned.   C;i several occasions, however, when theChief Hews Editor has endeavoured to verify an item he has been unable to get in touch with any responsible authority.  In this case no doubt arose.   It was surely the duty of the GovernmentPress Officer, when, he knew that  a wrong statement had been made over the tapes, to notify the Corporation when issuing adisclaimer to the Agencies.     The Governors realise that the accuracy of this particularitem is not the main burden of your complaint, which may be that,unless expressly authorised, no reference should be made to cabinet proceedings.  This restriction, which is of course farriore severe than any newspaper would accept, has so far never been suggested to the Corporation,,     It is relevant to mention that the procedure on 27th Maywas in line with past practice.  For instance, the bulletinsof 25th February, 9th and 19th March, and 1st and 22nd April allcontained references to subjects discussed at Cabinet meetingswithout provoking any protest on behalf of the Government.     The Corporation, however, stands in a position of special responsibility - a responsibility which we believe is discharged.in a manner which should not leave much room for criticism.Having dealt with this particular instance and having consideredthe general issue, the Corporation is prepared to accept thesuggestion you make and to agree  that in future  no reference willbe made in the News Bulletins to happenings at Cabinet meetingsunless by arrangement with the Government Press  Officer or otherre sp ons ible aptbori ty.                                   Yours etc.                            (Signed) R.C. NORMAN.                                      CHAIRMAN.

Hone Office.                                    23th May, 1956.Dear Sir,     A rumour has reached the Home  Secretary that  in thecourse of the B.B.C. Hews last night  a  statement was madein reference to  the Budget leakage  report  and its  allegeddiscussion by the Cabinet on the previous  day.   Sir john simon would be obliged if you would kindly let him have byreturn and if possible, by the hand of  the messenger whobrings this, the full text of what  wan  broadcasted on thesubject by your News Service, whether by the 6 o&apos;clock or .30 p. in. announcer and any other reference made yesterdayby -ilie B.-3.

Broadcasting House.                                23th Hay, 1936.Dear Private Secretary,     The Director-General desires me to  acknowledge receiptof your letter to him  just received.     Reference was made in our first and&apos;second news bulletinslast night to the leakage report.   I enclose a copy of whatwas broadcast on each  occasion.   This information came to us.from the news agencies from whom, as I think you know, we take all our news.     The references in our bulletins have just been comparedwith the actual tapes and a good deal more came over than weactually put out.    All we did was  to give a factual state-merit, talking care, as you will note, to use on both occasionsthe words &quot;it is understood.&quot;, which was  the form in which the news came over the tapes.                   Yours sincerely,                        J. STANLEY                  for Director-General&apos;s Secretary.The Private Secretary to    The Rt. Hon.  Sir John Simon, CCS. I., K. C.V. 0. ,  X. C. , M.
