THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1930.SECRET.                                                     Copy No   35CP. 249 (30).                                 CABINET.Imperial Conference, 1930.REPRESENTATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.       MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.                                   o     I HAVE been examining the procedure adopted as regards United Kingdom representation at previous Imperial Conferences, and, as a result, after consultation with the Prime Minister, I suggest that the permanent nucleus of United Kingdom representatives at the Conference might be constituted as follows :      (a) For political and general questions.           The Prime Minister.           The Lord Chancellor.           The. Chancellor of the Exchequer.           The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.           The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.     (b) For economic questions.           The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.           The President of the  Board of Trade.           The Chancellor  of the Exchequer           (or the Financial Secretary to the Treasury).     It seems appropriate,  in view of the separation of the posts of Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs and Secretary of State for the Colonies, that the latter should sit as a separate member  of the imperial Conference, representative of theColonies and Protectorates and the A and B Mandated Territories,  and I  suggestthat the Cabinet should formally  approve of any necessary action being taken, at thetime of the Conference,  with a View to  giving effect to this arrangement. I gatherthat it is the intention that, as at previous Conferences, the  Secretary of State forIndia should head the Indian delegation.     I understand that it would be the wish of the Prime Minister that other UnitedKingdom Ministers should be asked, as at former Conferences, to attend particularmeetings when matters of special interest to them come up for discussion.                                                   (Initialled)      J. H.  T.    Dominions Office, july 17, 1930.[21895]
