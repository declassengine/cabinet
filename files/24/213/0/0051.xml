Note by the Minister of Health on               Memorandum by the Minister of Labour                CO.P.235(30)].345(30)          The Minister of Labour&apos;s memorandum  (CP.235(30))appears to me to be a fair and full statement  of the points ofprinciple calling foir Cabinet decision in regard to unemploymentinsurance transitional benefit and public assistance.          The numbers and figures as to the recent transfer from public assistance to transitional benefit cover both England and&apos;,rales and Scotland, and are agreed to by my department assubstantially correct for England and V/ales.          At the present stage I need, I think, only make  specific reference to two points in the Memorandum.          Paragraph 24.  As my colleagues are  aware, I haverecently been pressing the public assistance authorities,  asa oonditlosTof giving out-relief to the able-bodied, to introduceschemes of training and eduoation for those who seem likely to benefit by it.  So far there has not been time to make much progress with such schemes, and I am bound to  point out that it  .is being represented to me that progress will  be made muoh moredifficult by the present situation in regard to transitional benefit.  In the same public assistance area there are persons,previotisly&apos;on poor relief and now receiving transitional benefit,without conditions and there are also persons  of much the  same typeand class remaining with the public assistance authorities and receiving relief but only on conditions.  A further point whiohhas been put to me by some authorities is that so many of  theable-bodied on poor relief have been transferred to transitional benefit that too few are left for the organisation of properschemes of training and education.
Paragraph 29 (also paragraph 37 ( iv)) .          &quot;(5)  Is there to, be a re-adjustment of thenew system of grants to Local Authorities under thederating scheme?&quot;          If by re-adjustment of the new system of grants is meant a reduction of the total amount of the grants payable and not only a redistribution of thetotal amount, there is little doubt that the answermust be in the negative.          The total sum of money is fixed by statute for the first 3 years and it would be useless to attemptto introduce legislation to reduce it.    It was neveraccepted as fully adequate by local authorities and evenif it had been, there are no clear grounds on which areduction could be justified.          Exchequer grants have never been givenspecifically for out-door relief,  and,  apart thereforefrom the part of the new grant which can be regardedas attributable to loss of rates on poor law expenditure,no question arises.   As regards loss of rates,it was, ofcourse an essential part of the scheme that theexpenditure of the standard year should for all purposesbe taken as the basis of oaloulation.   If an attemptwere to be made to provide for an adjustment of this expenditure on the ground that expenditure on poor lawhad in some areas been reduced, a claim for adjustment in respect of increased expenditure on other services,e.g. education,, roads, public health and unemploymentworlcs would have to be met.
          It should also be borne in mind that localauthorities have never accepted the position that thecost of the relief of the able-bodied due to unemployment should be borne wholly by local ratesand they are inclined to look upon the transfer of partof this charge to national funds as a lon^ delayed act of justice.          The only question which it is reallypracticable to consider is whether there sh.ou.ld be anyredistribution of the total money among localauthorities, i.e. whether the weighting factors in theformula of distribution embodied in the LocalGovernment Act require adjustment.          This matter vas fully considered at the timethe transitional benefit was instituted a;:d it seemed clear that no adjustment was required.   The onlyfactor really affected is that of the percentage ofunemployment.   This factor, however, was not introduced into the formula in direct relation to poor lawexpenditure.   It was intended to have a much wider-bearing as affording a suitable index of the povertyof an area and the need for special assistancegenerally.   Heavy and particularly lon.^-continuedunemployment affects a local authority in many waysbeyond the expenditure on outdoor relief notably inthe reduction of the effective rateable value of thearea owing to the inability of the ratepayers to payrates.          The necessitous areas where unemployment hasbeen most severe are heavily rate burdened quite apartfrom poor law expenditure on out relief.                     **J3-
          Such rate relief to  these areas as the  LocalGovernment Act has given (and  in many cases it  has  been substantial!  has done no more  than remove the peak  of high rates.   The rates are still relatively high andin spite of the further relief in respect of poor lawexpenditure it would not be practicable at this stage totake away any of the rate relief given by the formula tothe advantage of other areas less necessitous.          My conclusion is accordingly that no  adjustment of the formula is required on account of the transitional benefit and in any Cose on general grounds I shoulddeprecate a re-opening of the question of the grantformula at this stage.   The Act requires an investigation of the working of the formula to be made in consultationwith local authorities before the end of the second grantperiod (1936)  and this is none too long a period to enable a proper assessment of the full effect of the Act to bemade.                  (Initialled) A.G.Ministry of Health,   14th July, 1930.
