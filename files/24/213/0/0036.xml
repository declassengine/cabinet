THE COMMITTEE had before them  a  Report prepared by the Inter-Departmental Committee  on Inter-Imperial  Relations, for  the information  ofUnited Kingdom  Ministers,  on  Questions  connected with Mandates  (PaperNo.  I.E.C.  (30) 54).   The  Committee  were informed that the Report had  beenprepared  in consequence of  General  Hertzog&apos;s suggestion that the  conference should discuss &quot; the question of sovereignty in mandated territories, the temporarycharacter   of mandates  and  the  conferment  of  British  nationality  on  thenon-indigenous population in mandated territories.&quot;     THE COMMITTEE agreed-        To  take  note  of  and  approve   the   Report  in  question  (Paper    No. I.E.C. (30) 54).     2.  THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report (Paper No. I.E.C.(30)  55) by the Inter-Departmental Committee  on Inter-Imperial Relations, for theinformation of United Kingdom Ministers, on the  Deportation of British subjects.For convenience of reference the Summary and  Conclusions appended to this report are attached (Appendix I).     THE COMMITTEE agreed-        To  take  note  of  and  approve the suggestions  and  recommendations     contained in the Report in question &quot;as summarised in Appendix I.     3.  THE COMMITTEE had before them a  Report (Paper No. I.E.C.  (30) 56)by the Inter-Departmental  Committee  on Inter-Imperial Relations, prepared forthe information of United Kingdom Ministers, on the right in Commercial Treatiesto give special privileges to other parts of the Empire.     In this Report the view was expressed that no member of the  commonwealth should by treaty give  a  foreign country  the right to claim, under  most-favoured-nation provisions, any privilege which may be  accorded by that member of theCommonwealth to any other part of the Empire,  whether  that privilege concernspersons, goods, ships or companies, and it was  suggested as desirable that some suitable opportunity should be taken during the discussion of  cognate  subjects toraise this question at  the Imperial Conference,  with a view to obtaining generalagreement to apply the principle in future treaties.     THE COMMITTEE agreed-        To  take  note  of  and  approve   the   Report  in  question  (Paper     No. LEU.  (30) 56).     4.  THE COMMITTEE had  before them a draft Report (Paper  No. LEU.(30)  57) by the  Foreign Policy and Defence Sub-Committee on the Operation ofDominion Legislation  so far - as the  Services  are  concerned.   For  convenience ofreference the Summary of Recommendations appended to this Report is attached here to (see Appendix II).     In the course of  discussion  attention was  drawn to the question of  theapprehension of deserters, whether in the United  Kingdom or in a Dominion, which forms the subject  of  Paragraphs 16, 17  and 18 of the Report.  As explained inParagraph 17, there are two alternative methods of dealing with this question :-     (1) To enact that the relevant provisions of the Army and Air Force Acts shall           apply to the  case of  the  individual deserter from overseas,  and,  in           addition, to confer  an express power to surrender, preferably  at some           port in the United Kingdom, any arrested deserter to persons authorised           by the Dominion concerned to receive him;  or     (2) To include the offence of desertion among those offences for which offenders           may  be returned in custody from the United Kingdom  to a Dominion           under the provisions of the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, or the analogous           Statutes Which  apply as between the United Kingdom and the  Irish           Free State.     The Committee were invited to determine which of these alternative methodsshould  be  adopted, and, in this  connection,  were informed  that  the  Admiraltyfavoured the second alternative.     The attention of the  Committee was directed to certain  matters not covered bythe Report.  The first also concerned the Foreign  Office.  Under international agree-ments concluded in the past, certain restrictions  had  at times  been  imposed on british subjects, and His Majesty&apos;s Ships had on  occasions been given  bv Statute
 powers to enforce  these restrictions.  Presumably these  international  agreements were still binding on the Dominions, and His Majesty&apos;s Ships should still have the power to  seize offenders, and the Statutes already passed  giving this power should still remain  in  force.   Therefore,  there should  De an  understanding with  the Dominions that  they would not repeal such Statutes, but  that they should have continuing validity.  Otherwise, if His Majesty&apos;s  Ships seized offenders, an action might be brought in a Dominion court against the  Commanding Officer of a ship of war.  The Sea Fisheries Acts and the Seal Fisheries (Northern Pacific) Act, 1895, are examples.     The second  omission related to the question of action that might be taken by ships of the Royal Navy in connection with some municipal statutes, e.g., the Slave Trade Acts, and agreement with the Dominions might be required that  they would not annul any such  acts.     There was a third point.  The Admiralty wished to invite the attention of those who were discussing the present Report with Dominion  representatives  to  the Admiralty memorandum  in  I.C.(D.L.)/4,  in which the  Admiralty,  inter alia, emphasise the importance of an understanding with the Dominions that  they would not pass legislation that might impair the ability of His  Majesty&apos;s Ships to take measures  of  common naval defence except after consultation with the  United Kingdom, and, if necessary, with all the Dominions.     THE COMMITTEE agreed-     (1)  To request the Secretary of State for War to arrange for a  conference          between  representatives  of the War  Office,  the Admiralty, the Air          Ministry, the Home Office and any other Departments concerned, with a          view to agreement being reached as to which of the methods for  dealing          with the question of deserters from overseas set out in Paragraph 17 of          the Report should be adopted.     (2)  To take  note  of, and approve, the  recommendations  contained  in  the          Summary attached to Paper No. I.E.C. (30) 57 and, with regard to  the          question of  individual deserters, to adopt whichever method  of  dealing          with that problem may be agreed by the Inter-Departmental  Conference          named in (1) above.    (3)  That arrangements should be made for the consideration at  the  Conference          of the questions not covered by Paper No. I.E.C. (30) 57 of  interest to          the Admiralty, to which special reference is made above.    The Report  I.E.C. (30) 57 in final form was circulated after the Meeting.    5.   THE COMMITTEE had before them a Memorandum (Paper No.  I.E.C. (30) The Trend59) prepared for  the Imperial Conference, 1930,  by the War Office, on the Trend of org^sationArmy Organisation  for War.                                                    for War.    THE COMMITTEE  agreed-        To approve the Memorandum in question and to  authorise its  circulation    forthwith to the Dominions and  India.(The Prime Minister was called into, the House and  the Chair  was taken by the        Chancellor  of  the Exchequer for the remainder of  the Meeting.)                 X    6.   With reference to I.E.C., 6th Conclusions (1),  THE  COMMITTEE had Merchantbefore them a Memorandum (Paper No. I.E.C. (30) 48) by the Secretary of State for ^SonDominion  Affairs covering the draft of the proposed Agreement with regard to the  egl8 a lon&apos;Merchant  Shipping  Legislation in  the  form  agreed between  the  Departmentsconcerned, together with a covering memorandum, which it  was suggested should be telegraphed to the Dominions with copies of the draft Agreement.    The Committee  were informed  that the Prime  Minister had  expressed theopinion that the  suggestion that the use on ships of the  British Commonwealth ofthe red ensign should, in future, be permissible instead of obligatory, as at present,involved a  serious change which would be resented by large sections of the community.    THE  COMMITTEE agreed-        To authorise the despatch to the Dominions and India by telegram of the    draft  agreement and covering memorandum subject to the incorporation in the    latter  of a paragraph to the effect that the draft agreement is sent on the distinct    understanding that  it is treated  as a basis for  discussion and does not embody    the final considered views  of the United Kingdom Government.      [21495]                                                      B 2
     Since the Meeting, the Secretary of State for India has intimated his opinion that provision should be made for the participation of India in any agreement of the kind contemplated.     7.  With reference to I.E.C.,  10th Conclusions (11), THE COMMITTEE had before them two Memoranda  (Papers I.E.C. (30) 45 and I.E.C. (30) 61),  prepared for the use of United Kingdom Ministers,  on  the question of Bulk Purchase of Dominion Produce.     The Committee were informed of the circumstances in which the Memoranda had been prepared, and also that the Commonwealth Government had been asked for particulars of the proposals they intended to make, but that up to the present such particulars had not been received.  The view was expressed that a reasoned criticism of the  Australian Memorandum, when available,  should be prepared for the use of United Kingdom Ministers.     In the absence of the Prime Minister and other  members of the Committee, the Memoranda were not discussed,  and THE COMMITTEE agreed &apos;     (1) That the Papers LEU. (30) 45 and LEU. (30) 61 should be  printed  as           Briefs for  the use of United Kingdom Ministers at the  Conference.     (2) That the Australian Memorandum, when received, should be examined by           the Committee which had drafted LEU. (30)  61, and  that  a further           Memorandum thereon should be prepared for the use of United Kingdom           Ministers.     (3) That the Minister of Agriculture and  Fisheries,  the Secretary  of State           for  Scotland  and  any  other  Ministers  concerned  should  send   to           Sir S. Chapman any comments they might wish to make on the documents           before the Committee.     8.   THE COMMITTEE had before them a Memorandum (Paper LEU. (30) 32) prepared by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Economic Questions on Imperial Trade Machinery and  Imperial Economic Machinery.     THE COMMITTEE reached no conclusions regarding the various suggestions I and proposals contained in the Memorandum, but agreed          That the Memorandum  should be printed as a  Brief  for the use of United i;    Kingdom Ministers at the Conference.    9.  THE COMMITTEE had  under consideration the  following Memoranda j prepared by the  Inter-Departmental Committee  on Economic Questions :     (1) Double Income Tax Relief within the Empire (Paper LEU. (30)  43).               The Committee were warned that the proposal to  alter the present           arrangement, under which each country reciprocally agreed to refrain I           from taxing income  which accrued to  persons resident  in  the other I           country, was not likely to meet with general acceptance.    (2)  Constitution and Work of the Imperial Shipping Committee  (Paper LEU. I           (30) 34).    (3)  Empire Telegraphy (Paper  LEU. (30) 49).    (4)  The Work of the Imperial Institute (Paper LEU. (30) 50)..    (5)  The International Institute  of Agriculture at Rome (Paper I.E.C. (30) 51).    (6)  Petroleum Production and  Refining within the  Empire (Paper  LEU.           (30) 52).    (7)  Adequacy of  the Existing  Steamship Services  to Canada (Paper  LEU. 1           (30) 53).    (8)  Irrigation Research (Paper  LEU. (30) 62).    The Committee took note of  and approved the  above Memoranda, all of which Ihave been prepared as Briefs for the  use  of United Kingdom  Ministers  at theConference.    As  regards (5) above, the Committee agreed that arrangements should be made Ito  ensure  that the discussion  of  this question at  the Conference should take placesome days before the Meeting of the General Assembly of the International Institute Sat  Rome on the 14th October.    As  regards (8) above, the  Committee agreed that the Report of the Irrigation IResearch Committee of the Economic Advisory  Council might with advantage be :considered at the Meeting in 1932  of the Agricultural Research Conference,  and thatit should not be circulated to the Dominions and India at this stage.
     10.  THE COMMITTEE  had before them  a Memorandum (Paper  I.E.C. Growth of (30)  58) by the Executive Council of Imperial Agricultural Bureaux on the  growth  ithmrthe0a of Co-operation within the Empire in Scientific Agricultural Research.

Scientific     THE COMMITTEE agreed-                                              Agricultural                          P                                      .              Research.         To authorise the circulation forthwith of the Memorandum in question to     the Dominions and India.     11.  THE COMMITTEE  had under consideration a  Memorandum  by the Additional Inter-Departmental  Committee  on Economic  Questions  (Paper I.E.C.  (30)  63), S,^&quot;&quot; suggesting the addition to the Economic Agenda of the Conference of the following Agenda of the items .-                                ^                                      Conference.     (1) Any matters arising out  of the economic recommendations  of  the  1926          Imperial  Conference;     (2) Reciprocity in old age pensions;     (3) Agricultural research.     The Committee were also informed that the Secretary of State for  the Colonies had  suggested that the question of the world sugar situation should be placed on the Agenda.     THE COMMITTEE agreed-     To approve the proposals in I.E.C. (30) 63, viz. :           (1) That the Notes which have been prepared on the action  taken on the                 recommendations  of  the 1926 Conference should be  circulated                 forthwith to the Dominions and India.          (2) That the question of reciprocity in Old Age Pensions should be added                 to the Agenda.          (3) That  telegrams  should, if thought desirable, be  despatched to the                 Dominions and India suggesting  that it might prove convenient                 to  arrange for some discussion of  certain questions relating to                 Agricultural Research  during the Imperial Conference,  either by                 the appointment of a special Committee or by less formal means.          (4) To request the Colonial Office, in consultation with the Treasury and                 other Departments concerned, to prepare a Brief for the use of                 United Kingdom Ministers  on  the world sugar  situation  and                 submit proposals as to  the best method of raising the question at                 the Conference.     12.  THE COMMITTEE were informed that the Report on Naval Prize Law Naval Prize and  Prize Courts (Paper I.E.C. (30) 60) would, when ready, require to be carefully Law* considered by the Admiralty.  It was very desirable that this document should be examined by Ministers without undue delay, as legislation might have to be drafted for consideration by the Conference.

APPENDIX I.                     ^           ^           %r          $fc           ^ *                          SUMMARY AND  CONCLUSIONS.                  35.  Deportation within  the Commonwealth.     (i)  His Majesty&apos;&quot;s Government in the United Kingdom has no power at presenteither to exclude or to deport British subjects from the United Kingdom.  Most ofthe Dominions have  powers to exclude or to deport British subjects  from  their territory (paragraphs 3-8).     (ii) It is suggested that, if a part of the Empire desires  to deport a british subject  to another part of the Empire, the  destination of the deportee should bedecided  on   the  principle   that  he   should  be  sent  to  that  part  of  theEmpire with which he  is most closely  connected,  place of  birth  being  oneof the  considerations, but  other  factors, such as place  of education, length of residence, marriage and  family ties,  also being  taken  into consideration.  Thereshould  be  prior consultation  between  the  Government desiring  to  deport  andthe  Government of  the  territory  in which  it  is  proposed  to send the  deportee.Naturally, if the development of nationality law within  the  Commonwealth is suchas to result in the creation  of separate Dominion nationalities, and in proportion as these nationalities become more important at the expense of the common  status,the possession of a Dominion nationality would tend  to determine the  destination of a deportee, and might in certain  circumstances be conclusive (paragraphs 9-11).     (iii) To  enable the United Kingdom to participate effectively in a reciprocalscheme, it would be necessary to obtain legislative authority for excluding ordeporting undesirable British subjects from the United Kingdom (paragraph 12).     (iv) Any such legislation should be preceded by agreement between all Membersof the Commonwealth on      (a)  the conditions rendering a British subject liable to deportation, and     (b)  the liability of any Member to  admit to its territory a British subject so          deported by another Member.     In  any event, an agreement on these lines would  be of practical value even if no legislation followed (paragraphs 13-14).        36.   Deportation from Foreign Countries to  the  Commonwealth.     (i)  Practically, difficulties are limited at present to the question of deportationfrom the United States to Canada.  The Canadian practice leads to the deportationto the United Kingdom of  British subjects who have much more  connexion  with canada than with the United Kingdom,  and similar difficulties may be  expectedwith other Dominions (paragraphs 15-20).     (ii) It is suggested, therefore, that His Majesty&apos;s Government in  the UnitedKingdom should propose to the Imperial Conference that it should pass a resolutionapproving of the principles upon  which the practical  solutions of these difficulties should be based.  These principles are set out in detail in paragraph 21 and may besummarised as follows :      (1)  In the case of natural-born British subjects,  deportees should be sent to that          part  of  the   Empire  in which they  were  born,  unless  they  have          subsequently established a predominant connexion with some other part          of the Empire.     (2)  In the case of British subjects by naturalisation, they should be sent to the          territory of the  Government which issued  the certificate of  naturalisation-          tion, except (in  cases  where the holder has a certificate of  Imperial          naturalisation) where a subsequent connexion has been  made with some          other part of the Empire.     (3)  Wives of British subjects should be treated as belonging to the same category          as their husbands.
    (lii) Under international law a foreign State is not required to do more than tosend a deportee to the nearest point of the territory of the State to which he belongs.For this purpose, the British Empire is  at present generally regarded by foreigncountries as a single unit.  But difficulties have arisen in this connexion with UnionNationals deported from the Belgian  Congo  to  Northern Rhodesia (paragraohs23-26.)    (iv)  It is suggested that an agreement should be reached  between the Membersof the Commonwealth that, if a foreign country deports a British subject to a partof the Empire  to which he  does not belong, the  part of the Empire to which hebelongs should  agree to admit him, and to defray his travelling expenses from thepart to which he is deported by the foreign country (paragraph 27).  37. Passport Facilities for persons naturalised in the Dominions and residing                                    abroad.    (i) Locally naturalised British  subjects. This form of naturalisation  is nowpractically obsolete except  in India.  A British subject  locally naturalised  in a dominion does not possess British nationality except in that Dominion.    (ii) It is suggested that passports  should  not be issued abroad to any  suchlocally naturalised person except upon the recommendation of the Dominion Govern-ment concerned, and that this Government should undertake to receive back within its territory  any holder of  a  passport so granted  if a foreign country decides to deport him (paragraph 30).    (iii)  Imperially naturalised  British  subjects. The holder of a  certificate ofImperial naturalisation is primd facie entitled as of right to protection abroad andto the passport facilities ordinarily accorded to British subjects unless and until hiscertificate of naturalisation is revoked (paragraph  31).    (iv) The Canadian Government in particular decline to be responsible  for theissue of passports to holders of unrevoked certificates granted in Canada if tileholder has lost his &quot; Canadian domicile &quot; (paragraph 31).    (v)  There may, however, be circumstances in which a passport should properly be given,  and it is suggested  that the Canadian Government  should be pressed toagree to the enjoyment of passport facilities  by  any British  subject imperiallynaturalised  in Canada  until his certificate of naturalisation is revoked.  For thispurpose a modification of the Canadian  Immigration Act  is desirable (paragraphs32-33).    (vi) It is further desirable that all the Dominions should agree to adopt theproposed  amendment of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, givingpower to revoke certificates of naturalisation when the holder fails to register forone year when abroad (paragraph 34).******

The following is a summary of our conclusions and recommendations :      (1) That, in order to give effect to paragraph 44 of the O.D.L. Report, legisla-tion is required in the United Kingdom      (a) to amend the Army and Air Force Acts so as to make it clear that they are           no longer intended to form part of the law of any Dominion or to impose           obligations on the civil power in the Dominion;     (&amp;) to provide that, when a visiting force of Dominion troops is  present in the           United Kingdom or in the Colonies,  its discipline shall continue to he           regulated in accordance with the law of the Dominion, and that, to that           extent, it shall not be subject to the local law;     (c) to provide that the civil power shall afford to a visiting Dominion force in           the United  Kingdom  and in the Colonies the same  assistance  as is           afforded to Imperial Forces, subject to any exceptions and modifications           which may be thought  desirable.     (2) That the necessity for legislation by each Dominion being  recognised by paragraph 44 of the O.D.L.  Report,  the Dominions should  be  invited to  pass legislation on similar lines, mutatis mutandis, to (b) and (c) above.     (3) That the legislation to be passed in the United Kingdom for the purposesof (b) and (c) above should be embodied in a separate and permanent statute.     (4) That &quot;visiting force &quot; should be defined as including  all persons belongingto or attached to the force who are subject to their own military  code at the moment of arrival in the United Kingdom or Dominion, as the case may be, but that power should be taken to allow the extension of military discipline to such other classes ofpersons ordinarily resident in  the territory where the visiting  force is as  may beagreed between the two Governments concerned.     (5) That the question of individual deserters, no visiting force being present,requires to be specially dealt with, and that this should be done by  one of two alternative methods, which are described.     (6) That no steps are necessary to amend the Naval Discipline Act on the lines suggested in recommendation (1)  (a)  above  in connection with  the Army and AirForce Acts.     (7) That legislation requires to be passed, in  the Dominions, as regards naval forces, on lines analogous to those in recommendation (2) above.     (8) That certain Other Acts affecting the internal discipline  of the armed forces should be applied either by general words or otherwise, but that in the case of Acts ;affecting relations with the civil power it will probably be necessary that they shouldbe applied nominatim.     (9) That it is of vital importance that a sufficient  time should elapse before theStatute of Westminster becomes  operative  to enable  the Dominions  to pass thenecessary legislation, in order that there may be no hiatus between the new system and  the old so far as the legal basis of discipline is concerned.     (10) That the application of these recommendations in the case of India shouldreceive the attention of the Government of India and the India Office.     (11) That attention should be drawn to certain special features of the military position in the Irish Free State.     (12) That the opportunity should be  taken of removing certain difficulties whichhave arisen  in connection with the mutual exercise  of command in cases whereImperial  and Dominion troops are acting  together or personnel  of  one force are Iattached to the other.          ******o

imperial conference and EconomioConference,1930.PolicyCommittee.Agenda forConferenceandProcedure.    1.  WITH reference to I.E.C. 9th Conclusions 2 (c), the Committee had beforethem a Note (I.E.C. (30) 47) by the Dominions Office covering draft telegrams (A and b) to the Dominions dealing respectively with procedure at the Conference and apublic announcement as to the Agenda.   The Committee approved  amendments to.the telegrams to the following effect              To telegram A                   At the end of third paragraph add                        &apos;&apos; say not more than ten minutes, which would consume about one hour                       and a half, and that each speech should be written out beforehand.&quot;              To telegram B                   Paragraph 2, line 10,  before  &quot;disputes&quot; insert  &quot;Inter-Imperial.&quot;                  Paragraph 2, line 12, after  &quot; cognate &quot; to insert &quot; and arising from.&quot;                  Paragraph 3, line 8, delete &quot; the.&quot;              The  attention of the  Committee  was specially  directed  to  the inclusion in          paragraph 2 of  &quot;nationality&quot; as a question to be  placed on the Agenda.   The          Committee were reminded that the Inter-Departmental Committee on Inter-Imperial          Relations had reached the conclusion that the general aspects of this question were          certain to be raised at the  Conference in connection  with subjects such as  &quot; married          women,&quot;  &quot; deportation &quot; and &quot; commercial treaties,&quot; but that the Attorney-General          had expressed some doubt as to  the desirability of proposing the definite inclusion          of the general question.              It was represented that it was very desirable that  the Government should decide          in advance on their policy  in regard  to the &apos;&apos; nationality &apos;&apos; question as a whole, and          then apply that  policy to each  separate aspect of  the  question as it arose at the          Conference.              THE  COMMITTEE agreed-              (1) To approve the despatch forthwith to the Dominions and India of telegrams                     in the form of drafts A and B, attached to LEG. (30) 47, subject to the                    modifications indicated above.              (2) To request the Lord Chancellor to preside over a special  Sub-Committee,                    to prepare a further Brief for the use of United Kingdom Ministers, on                     the whole question of nationality.Form of         2.  THE COMMITTEE had before them a Report by the Inter-Departmentals^natuieand Committee on Inter-Imperial  Relations on  the form of Preamble,  Signature and          Ratification of Treaties (LEU. (30) 28).  For convenience of reference the Summary          and Conclusions of this Report are attached, see Appendix I.              THE  COMMITTEE adopted the conclusions set out in paragraphs (1), (2) and          (3) of the  Summary.              With regard to the suggestion in paragraph (4) of  the Summary, it was generally          agreed that there was little or no prospect that the Irish Free State would abandon          the  recital in their instruments of ratification  of the phrases referred to in  that          paragraph.   Doubts, moreover, were expressed as to whether good would result from          raising at the Conference  the suggested question of principle, viz., that changes of          procedure of this character should  only  be made as a result  of  consultation and          agreement.  The only effect of raising the question might be to cause other Dominions          to unite with the Irish Free State in demanding similar or even greater departures          from the standard form.   On the other hand, it was urged that the Irish Free State          would find it difficult to persuade the Conference to adopt their view on the question          of  principle and that even if no agreement was reached  the position would be no          worse than at present.              THE COMMITTEE  agreed-                  That in the first  instance  the problem should be  discussed confidentially              with  the Irish Free State delegation.  This discussion  should proceed on the              basis that it is  admitted  that complete uniformity of procedure  cannot be              insisted upon, and that the inclusion of  reference to  the Ministerial advice on              which His Majesty acts could not be resisted if the point were pressed.ratification of Treaties.
Statute of westminster.        References  to parliamentary  approval  were, however,  in  a  different    category.   It was by no means certain that other of His Majesty&apos;s Governments    would agree to the inclusion of such references or, at any rate, of references to    approval of both Houses of Parliament.  Hence insistence on  the inclusion of    such references was bound to have reactions elsewhere.        This should be pointed out to the Free  State representatives and it should    be urged that it was desirable that every effort should be made to secure that    changes of procedure of the kind in question should only be effected as the result    of consultation and agreement.        If no solution on this basis can be found, the question of raising the issue    at the Conference should-be further considered.    3.   THE  COMMITTEE had under consideration  a Note by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (LEG. (30) 22) covering (inter alia) a draft  Bill to giveeffect to the recommendations of the Report of the Dominion Legislation Conferencem  so  far as  they are designed  to secure   complete  legislative freedom  for  theDominions.    The Committee discussed the question whether  the Addresses  to His Majestymentioned in  the  recital  in square brackets on page 2  of  the  draft should  be presented before or after the introduction of the Bill in the Parliament of the UnitedKingdom.  If the latter, then difficulties might arise from the fact that a Bill whichhas passed through all its stages cannot be suspended, but must be presented for theRoyal Assent on the first  opportunity.  On  the  other hand, the former alternative would mean that the hands of Parliament  would be tied  in advance,  and it was doubtful whether Parliament would assent to such a proposition.    With a view to avoiding these difficulties, it was suggested that agreement withregard to the  terms  of the Bill should  be reached  informally  at the ImperialConference, and that the Addresses should contain no reference to the draft Bill, but should merely ask that legislative effect  should  be  given to the conclusions of theConference.   It was also suggested that, if  possible, the assent of the opposition parties to the proposed legislation should be  obtained in advance.    THE COMMITTEE agreed-    (1)  That the procedure outlined in the  preceding paragraph in regard to the          Addresses should be adopted, and that the recital  on page 2 of the Bill          should be amended accordingly.    (2)  That Ministers should confer in regard to the question of obtaining the          agreement of the Opposition Parties  to the proposed legislation.    (3)  That the title of the Bill  to be proposed at  the  Imperial Conference should          be &quot;The Statute of Westminster.&quot;    (4)  That the question of the insertion in section 1 (2) of the date as from which          the Act is to become operative should be considered in  connection with          the  Memorandum  to  be  circulated  regarding  Discipline   of   the          Forces, &amp;c.    4.   THE  COMMITTEE had before them a Report of the Inter-Departmental  &apos;^ecf^^Committee on  Inter-Imperial Relations on  &quot; The  System of Communication and  eationand1Consultation between His Majesty&apos;s Governments&quot;  (LEG. (30) 31).                Weelfms    The Committee adopted the suggestions  and conclusions set out  in the Summary  Majesty-s 0 that Report, which reads as follows :-                                          Governments.                                  :.  &quot;Summary.        To sum up, it seems to us that the  general principles of information and    consultation as at present  laid down are the best that can  be devised in the    circumstances;  they  require to be  better understood  and  applied in  the    Dominions rather than amended.  The application of them in practice is bound    to lead to difficulties; of these difficulties some are inherent in the  very nature    of the Commonwealth; others, it may be hoped, may grow less with the passage of    time and the growth in the Dominions of experience in the conduct of foreign    affairs.  In the circumstances, we recommend that at the Imperial Conference    it should  be pointed out to the Dominion Representatives that His Majesty&apos;s    Government  in  the United  Kingdom   are  at pains  to give the Dominion    Governments the earliest possible information as to any negotiations which they    contemplate with foreign countries, and  that it is only reasonable that Dominion    Governments  should  give the United  Kingdom  Government corresponding       [21443]           &apos;                      &apos;                      B 2

We suggest  that in this     connection  stress should be laid on the fact  that a contrary procedure, apart     from embarrassing the United Kingdom negotiators, may well give to foreign     countries an impression of disunity among the Members of the British Common-     wealth at a time when it is most important to emphasise their unity of purpose     and action  if negotiations are to reach a successful conclusion.&quot;     5.  THE COMMITTEE  approved the despatch to the Governments of South Africa and New Zealand of the  Telegrams in the form of the drafts annexed to I.E.C. (30) 29.     6.  THE  COMMITTEE  accepted the recommendation in the Memorandum (LEU. (30) 9B) of the Inter-Departmental Committee of Inter-Imperial Relations, entitled &quot; Channels of Communication between Dominion Governments and Foreign Countries,&quot; that the heading          &quot;matters relating to civilian flights on recognised inter-national air routes,&quot; should be inserted in paragraph 12 of Memorandum IV of            (LEU. (30) 9) between the headings  &quot; Facilities for  British subjects belonging to the Dominions in visiting foreign countries &quot; and &quot; Legislation and Certification of Documents.&quot;     7. In pursurance of LEU. (30)  7th  Conclusions 5, THE  COMMITTEE had before them a Memorandum by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Inter-Imperial Relations,  prepared  for circulation  to the Dominion  Governments  on  matters connected with the form of Commercial Treaties (LEU. (30) 40).     The Committee approved  the Memorandum in question  for circulation to the Dominion and Indian Delegations on arrival in the United Kingdom.     8. THE COMMITTEE  adopted the Report (LEU.  (30) 41) of the Inter- Departmental Committee on Inter-Imperial Relations on &quot;[Personal Rights&quot; for &quot; British Subjects &quot; in the Commercial Treaties.  For  convenience of reference  a copy of the Summary and Conclusions in this Report is attached, see Appendix II.     9. With reference to LEU.  (30), 8th Conclusions, THE  COMMITTEE are agreed to  request the Legal Sub-Committee to prepare, for their consideration,  a Memorandum on Regency and  Cognate Questions  in a form suitable for circulation to the  Dominions and India.     The Committee also  agreed that no Memorandum on  Advice to the Crown on Dominion matters should be circulated to the Dominions and India.     10.  THE   COMMITTEE  had   before   them  a   Note  by  the  Secretary (I.E.C. (30) 30), covering  a Memorandum prepared by the Air Staff for the Imperial Conference on Air Power and Imperial Defence.     The Committee took note that the  Chief of the Naval Staff and the  Chief of the Imperial General Staff, while agreeing to the circulation of the paper, do not wish itto be assumed that they agree to all possible inferences which may be drawn from its contents.     THE COMMITTEE agreed-     (1) That the Memorandum should  bear  the  title &quot; Air  Power  and Imperial           Defence,&quot; as printed.     (2) To approve the Memorandum in question for circulation to the Dominion j           and Indian Delegations on arrival in the United Kingdom.     11.   THE  COMMITTEE were informed as  to the  arrangements in operation I for the preparation of Memoranda and Briefs for  Ministers on Economic Questions. The Prime Minister hoped  that  it would be  possible  for the  Chancellor  of  the Exchequer to  attend future  Meetings at which economic  documents raising large questions of policy are under consideration, and stated that Ministers  who are not members of the Committee  would be specially invited  to attend when questions concerning their Departments are under consideration.     In this connection, reference was made to the Memorandum (LEU. (30) 45) on Bulk Purchase of Dominion Produce, and Sir S. Chapman was requested to arrange for  the preparation by  members  of his Inter-Departmental Committee  specially
concerned of a further comprehensive Memorandum on  this subject, in which thefacts should be set out and the different views regarding the policy should be fullystated.    12.  THE COMMITTEE agreed to postpone consideration of the following Briefs for items on the Agenda to the next meeting, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer and ^nJ^0&quot;other Ministers concerned could be present :                                     Questions.

APPENDIX  I.                                    SUMMARY  OF CONCLUSIONS.Extract from      37.   To SUFIl UD :-IE C. (30) 28.                    1              (1) We examine the various forms of  preamble used in bilateral instruments          and show why the 1926 form &quot; For Great Britain and Northern Ireland, all British          Colonies and Protectorates,  and all Mandated Areas administered by His Govern-          ment in Great Britain &quot; has been, shortened in  most  cases to &quot; Eor  Great Britain          and Northern Ireland.&quot;   These bilateral instruments being, however, of primary          concern only to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, we do not think          it necessary to obtain formal approval of the procedure employed in these cases at          the Imperial Conference (paragraph 11).              (2) We examine the problem which has been  created by  the introduction of          separate ratifications in lieu of one single instrument in respect of all parts of the          Empire covered by the treaty in its particular relation to the simultaneous deposit          of the separate ratifications. After examining the correspondence connected with          the Paris  Peace Pact and the  Poison Gas Protocol,  we recommend that, in view          of the difficulty of defining cases when simultaneous deposit would be  advisable, this          question should not be raised at the Imperial Conference (paragraph 18).              We note that the ratification article in the recent London Naval Treaty was,          at the request of certain Dominions, made to read :  &quot;In respect of each and all of          the members  of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&quot;   Analogous cases  in  the          future are, however, likely to be rare (paragraph 19).              (3) We examine two recent cases  where there has been a difference of opinion          as to whether His Majesty&apos;s ratifications or Governmental ratifications should be          employed.   We think that,  although it might be possible to  suggest at the forth-          coming Conference that in the case of all international instruments not definitely in          the inter-Governmental form the procedure  of ratification by His Majesty would be          appropriate,  yet we are very doubtful whether such a suggestion would command          general acceptance.  In the circumstances it is doubtful whether there would be any          advantage in raising the question (paragraph 27).              (4) We examine the problem created by the desire  of the  Irish Free State to          recite in their instruments of ratification the phrases (i) &quot; And whereas the Dail and          Seanad of Our  Irish Free State have  approved of the  said Treaty,&quot;  and  (ii)          &quot; Whereas the Executive Council of the Irish Free State have advised Us to ratify          the aforesaid Treaty in respect  of Our Irish Free State.&quot;   We recognise that it is          not possible to insist on complete uniformity of  procedure in matters of this kind,          but we attach great importance to the principle that changes of this nature  should          only be made as a result of consultation and  agreement, and we therefore recommend          that this question  should be raised at the  Imperial Conference and an endeavour          made to secure general agreement that, while complete uniformity in matters of this          nature is  not essential, it  is  most important  that any changes of  substance in          established procedure  should only be made  as a  result of a process of consultation          and agreement (paragraph 36).APPENDIX II.

(i) After pointing out that the problem of obtaining personal rights for all          British subjects of whatever origin in  commercial treaties is of old standing, and          recording the recommendation  of  the  Inter-departmental  Committee in 1926, we          examine some recent cases in which this problem has again arisen (paragraphs 1 to 6).              (ii)  We draw attention to the fact that whereas in 1926 it appeared that foreign          Governments were not alive to the  point, since that date China, Turkey and Soviet
Russia have become fully aware of the implications involved.  But we note also that,so far, it has not been necessary to make any concession in the direction of limiting the categories of British subjects on whose behalf the benefits of the treaty could be claimed (paragraphs  7 to 10).    (iii) We  then discuss the factors which must be taken into consideration in solving the practical problem, which resolves itself into :     (1)  Should present practice be maintained ?    (2)  If present practice is not, or cannot be, maintained, what procedure should           be adopted (paragraphs 11 to 16) ?    (iv) As a result  of this  examination we recommend  the  maintenance  of  thepresent  practice of obtaining benefits for all subjects of His  Majesty,  and  thedesirability of His Majesty&apos;s Governments  in the Dominions adopting  a similarpolicy (paragraph 17).    (v)  We point out that the procedure to be adopted, if for any reason maintenanceof the present practice is found  impossible, will depend largely  upon the solutionfound for the nationality problem.   We are not convinced,  however, that even were all  the  Dominions to  define  by law special  categories  of  British subjects  as constituting  their &quot;nationals,&quot;  foreign Governments  would  necessarily wish to exclude British subjects merely by reason of connexion with the Dominions,  and theymight be willing to agree to  an exclusion limited to such British subjects  as  are connected with those  Dominions  who do not grant reciprocal treatment.   We are,therefore, of  the opinion that in  such  cases  it  would be  best  not  to  vary  thephraseology of that part of the treaty which confers the benefits  on the subjects orcitizens of the High Contracting Parties, but to deal with this particular aspect by aseparate article or instrument (paragraphs 18 to 20).    (vi) We have also examined the problem as it would affect the position of Britishsubjects connected with other parts of the Empire, and  we  point out  that  any modification  of  the  existing practice might  add  to our  difficulties  in  treaty negotiations  with  foreign Powers  in respect  of  other  parts  of  the  Empire(paragraphs 21  and 22).    (vii) We have also examined the analogous problem of obtaining benefits for all british ships,  and we recommend that in this case also an endeavour should be madeto obtain  benefits for ships registered in any part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions(paragraphs 23 and 24).
