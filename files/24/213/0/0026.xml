(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMIQ  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)               I oiroulate for the information of my colleagues a     copy of a paper which I communicated to the  Chancellor of the     Exchequer on the subject of the restoration  of the State     contribution to National Health Insurance to the figure at     which it stood before the passing of the Economy Act,  1926.               The Chancellor of the Exchequer informs me that in     his judgment the finanoial situation, present and prospective,     is suoh that proposals of this kind must be  deferred.               It will be within the knowledge of my colleagues that     there is very strong feeling amongst our supporters and     especially among the women in favour of improved provision for     maternity.  The general movement on the part of approved     societies for the restoration of the State Contribution is jurb     so immediately pressing but It may at any time become a     political factor likely to cause embarrassment.               In these circumstances, I think my colleagues should     be aware of \that has..passed between myself and the Chancellor     and that if the Cabinet endorses the Chancellors view I     should have full authority in stating that an improved maternity     scheme and the restoration of the State Contribution are things     which will have to be postponed on the ground of the general     financial position.3rd July, 1930.

In 1928 no less than 3,710 deaths ofwomen were classed to pregnancy and child-bearing orassociated therewith.
          The provision at present made with State assistance for women in pregnancy and childbirth is of two kinds.      (1)   Facilities for ante-natal supervision and for child birth under the maternity and child welfare schemes of local authorities.      (S)   Maternity benefit under the National Health Insurance scheme for insured women and the wives of insured men,  amounting to  2 which is in the case of most societies increased as part of the society&apos;s scheme of additional benefits payable from Its surplus.  Married women who are employed and insured receive two maternity benefits ( 4 or more) on confinement.          My predecessor was deeply concerned with the problem and appointed two committees to do work in relation to it, a committee of-medical experts charged with the task ofmaking intensive research into the actual facts of each case of maternal mortality as it occurs and suggesting fresh lines of action to reduce that mortality;  and a committee to consider the working of the Midwives Acts,- 1902 to 1926,  withparticular reference to the training of midwives,  including its relation to the education of medical students in midwifery, and the conditions under which midwives are employed.          The first of these committees is just producing an interim report.    The second of them,  usually known as theBolam Committee,  made its report some time ago.          The report contains a lEirge number of detailed recommendations  with which I need not trouble  my colleagues&apos;,For the present  purpose the important  thing in it  is a strong recommendation&apos; in favour of the introduction of a national scheme linked up with National Health  insurance for the
provision  of proper medical, midwifery and nursing carebefore, during and after child birth.           The Committee base themselves to a large extent onthe views  of the Royal Commission on National HealthInsurance  in 1926, the effect of whioh was that maternitybenefit ought ultimately to be redistributed in such a way as to secure chat while a certain part of it continues to bepaid in cash by the approved society, the  balance should be devoted to  securing proper medical and midwifery attentionto the women before, during and after child  birth, this latter service being linked up with the related public health services, .by which they meant the maternity and child welfare services of the local authorities.           On the National Health Insurance side,  the matter has continued to engage the attention of the approved societies Consultative Council attached to the Ministry ofHealth and this Council has declared its acceptance of theprinciple of re-allocation of maternity benefit advocated by the Royal Commission and has gone so far as to  agreethat,  if a cash benefit of  1 is provided, the balanceof the available insurance monies should be pooled insome way and devoted to an improved medical and maternityservice for insured women and the wives of insured men, themoney thus set free being regarded as exhausting thefinancial liability of societies in the matter.         M          The medical profession is also keenly interestedin the matter and the British Medical Association  has drawnup and published a complete scheme for a medical,  midwiferyand nursing service for women before,  during and afterchild birth.
          The whole situation is thus one which on its merits calls for very full exploration.   There shouldalso be added the strictly political considerations(a) that the late government pledged themselves, ifreturned to office, to deal with the demand for a completematernity service and (b) that there is in existence aprivate bill, strongly supported on our own side, for theprovision of such a service.   There is, moreover, strong feeling among women of all parties, expressions of whichreaoh me constantly from women of our own party, that thepresent arrangements are gravely inadequate and that earlyimprovements must be made.          I find that the problem of the organisation ofsuch a service was carefully examined in this Ministry bydireotion of the late Minister and a soheme was preparedwhich would no doubt have been proceeded with if the late government had returned to power.   At the present stageit is not necessary for me to trouble my colleagues withthe details of the soheme (some of which I should wish toconsider further) beyond observing that it contemplates afull medical, midwifery and nursing servioe provided as amatter of obligation, normally by the county and countyborough councils and financed by means of a paymentsecured from insurance funds, mainly by the use of a partof the present maternity benefit, * an Exohequercontribution.          IVhat the amount of Exchequer money required would be it is impossible to estimate with any precision,as it depends on the terms which could be arranged withdoctors and midwives for their services, and on thearrangements which could be ma.de&apos; with looal authorities.                            .                          The/
The annual Exohequer charge provisionally thoughtprobable by the department was in the neighbourhood of 1,000,000.          partly from consideration of this problem andpartly on other grounds! have been brovight up against thequestion of the reduction of the State contribution to national Health Insurance effected by the so-calledEconomy Act, 1926*    Before that Act, the state contribution was 2/9ths of the benefits,  and was reducedby the Aot to l/7th of the Benefits for men and l/5th ofthe benefits for women.   The saving to the Exchequer wasabout two and three quarter millions per annum.          The reduction was defended on the broad groundthat on the actuarial basis of the Scheme, the reduced state contribution was adequate to safeguard the statutory benefits and not to prejudioe the provision of satisfactoryadditional benefits.  It was resisted throughout by our ownparty (and vehemently by the Liberal Party) as being tantamount to a breach of contract with the insured population and as being no true economy at all.  The approved societies were of coursebitterly opposed to it and there has been among them a continuousundercurrent of feeling on the subject.  This feeling is beingstrengthened.by the published results of  the enquiry recently made by the government Actuary into sickness and disablement  amongthe insured population, which indicates that, onthe experience of 1927, the provision made for thatclass of benefit under the existing finance of the insurancescheme is inadequate, especially as regards women.I am having the most careful investigation made tosee how far it is possible to reduce the  olaims, and the
benefit payments following on them, by improved metiiodsof administration, but when the utmost possible allowance is made for such action, I am afraid that further financial provision will be found to be inevitable.   Inpresent circumstances there can be no question of increasingcontributions and the only possible course is an increase inthe State grant,   A factor which has also to be borne in mindin considering the whole problem is the Third Valuation of approved Societies which is now in progress.   The indicationsat present are that the results, in the case of some of thelarge Societies, .^ay be such as to give rise to a strong demandfor, at all events, the restoration of the State grant to thefigure at which it stood before the Economy jict of 1926.   Itshould be remembered  that the -iet not only reduced the Stategrant but klso placed on the funds of societies an additionalcharge for the residual cost of medical benefit amounting toabout one and a quarter millions a year.          In the above circumstances I think that I cannot avoidraising the question of the restoration of the state contribution to the figure at which it stood before the EeonomyAct of 1926.   The additional Exchequer charge involved wouldbe about two and three quarter millions a year and it would bea condition of the restoration of the State grant that, to theextent of about one million a year, the money should be devotedto the improved maternity service already mentioned.           To the extent to which it would be so devoted asubstantial extension and improvement of the health provision ofthe country would result.   In this connection I think that ought also to make reference to another matter.   The greetoutstanding defect on the health side of National HealthInsurance is that the statutory medical service stops g.t the
general practitioner.   Such expert services as are availableare only provided spasmodically from additional benefits.The addition of a specialist and consultant service has alwaysbeen regarded as necessary to round off the medical service.Provisional schemes for such a service have been worked out inthe iiinistry.   The scope of it would of course defend on themoney available.   In this matter also any estimate of cost inustbe provisional, pending negotiation with the medical professionbut a very useful service co-aid, I think, be set on foot at a cost in the neighbourhood of one million a year, the bulk ofwhich could not be found by restoring the State contribution but would have to be a new Exchequer grant.          It is a question whether this is or is not matter for the Cabinet Committee on the co-ordination of thesocial services.   The improved maternity service and the specialist and consultant service are of course expansions ofa service, rather than co-ordination, but I aa not unmindfulof&apos;  the fact that such a subject as e,g4 possible further extensioof widows1 pensions has been dealt with by reference to theCabinet Committee.   &quot;What I am concerned about is to be enabled to state the intentions of the government and I have an openmind as to the procedure by which a definition of thoseintentions is to be reached.          I should perhaps add that the improved maternity and specialist and consultant services would involve somewhat lengthynegotiations and that an early decision is accordingly necessary if anything is to be done in tx.at connection, say in the next                     *twelve months.
