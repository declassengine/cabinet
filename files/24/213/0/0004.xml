HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT),        SECRET.                                  COPY No. 3&amp;        CP. 20^(50).                        CAB IN E T.        CHARING- CROSS BRIDGE SCHEME.   MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT.         In my Memorandum CP. 1.4-5(350.) of the 6TH May, 19^0, uponthe subject of the  rejection by a Select Committee of the Houseof Commons of the Charing Cross Bridge Bill, I informed theCabinet that in my view, whilst it was a matter entirely for theLondon County Council, the circumstances were so exceptionalthat the Council might think fit to ask for the Bill to berecommitted.   I was authorised to intimate to the London CountyCouncil that, should they propose to take this action, theGovernment whilst leaving the matter to a free vote of the Houseof Commons, would support the necessary motion.   On my makinga statement to this effect in answer to a parliamentary question, some objection V/as evident on the Front OppositionBench to an;; attempt to set aside the findings of the SelectCommittee.         I have now received from the London County Council aletter, dated the 2FTH June, of which a copy is attached and whichis self-explanatory, without the Reports therein referred to.It will be observed that the Council have definitely decided notto ask for recommittal of the Bill, or even to re-introduce thepresent Bill next Session, but propose ,:subject to theconcurrence of the Minister of Transport&quot; to appoint an AdvisoryCommittee consisting of representatives of all partiesinterested, including the ILOI al Academy, the Ro, al Institute ofBritish Architects and the Royal Pine Arts Commission, to review
the whole position with a view to the preparation of some&quot;agreed&quot; scheme (subject to certain limitations).   They also propose to include two representatives of the Ministry ofTransport.         I was not a party to the proposal to set up such aCommittee, and I was not consulted about it hut merely informed of the Council&apos;s proposals.   I consider that the matter is nowprimarily one for the London County Council, and that theGovernment should neither approve nor dissent from the courseupon which the Council has publicly decided^   At. the same time,it appears to me to he undesirable for any repiebenT-at-irce of myDepartment to serve upon a committee appointed to advise theLondon County Council and to &quot;agree&quot; a scheme which might commitor at least embarrass the Government at some future date.Furthermore, even though the Committee should evolve a rcreme,any necessary Parliamentary powers could, not be sought before1932* and v/e ought to retain complete liberty of action on thequestion of grant.         It will also be remembered that, under the LondonTraffic Act of 192^* there is a Statutory Advisory Committee on london Traffic to whom I should be bound to refer any such scheme for consideration and report.         It is, however, important that any action theGovernment may take should not be capable of being misrepresentedas evidence of a desire to obstruct a solution of the problem ofthe Waterloo and Charing Cross Bridges if a solutiou can stillbe found.    I would, therefore, propose, whilst declining to berepresented on the Committee,  to offer to furnish them with any information in my possession,  and to render them any technical assistance I can, and to answer the Council&apos;s letter in the termsof the attached draft.

I am to ask that the Council may receive an assurance atthe earliest possible moment of the concurrence of the ministerof Transport in the setting up of the proposed advisory committee,in order that invitations&apos;may be sent to the other authoritiesand societies concerned to appoint representatives to serve onthe committee, and that tbe necessary steps for convening thecommittee may be taken with the least possible delay.         I am also to ask that the Ninister, in the event of hisconcurring in the appointment of the advisory committee, willnominate two representatives to serve t lie re on.                              I am, Sir,                                   Your obedient Servant,(Sgd. )  Montague  H.  Cox.  Clerk of the Council.
Sir,                 CHARING CROSS BRIDGE SCHEME.         I am directed &quot;by the Minister of Transport to refer to your letter of the l(-th June, E. 53198, upon the subject ofthe Charing Cross Bi*idge scheme, forwarding copies of Reportsof the Parliamentary Committee and the Improvements Committee,dated the 29th and both May respectively, which were adoptedby the Council at their meeting on the 3rd June.         The Minister notes that the Council have decided notto take any steps in the direction of attempting to obtainthe recommittal of the Charing Cross Bridge Bill by the Houseof Commons, but, subject to the concurrence of the Minister,to appoint an Advisory Committee to prepare and submit to theCouncil, within nine months, an agreed scheme for a road bridge and approaches at Charing Cross, at an estimated cost notexceeding  12,500,000.         The procedure contemplated by the Council would appearto work out in the following way:         If it be assumed that the Advisory Committee is ableto agree on a scheme and that it is able to reach such agreementwithin nine months, the report of the Committee would bereceived by the Council at the earliest in March, I93I.Notwithstanding the agreement of the Advisory Committee, it isof course, possible that criticisms may be received frominterested bodies and the general public, which the council would wish to take into consideration.   Assuming, however,that the Council came to an early decision upon therecommendation of the Advisory Committee, this decision wouldrequire to be submitted to  the Minister who would then examinethe scheme after receiving  - as he is obliged to receive underthe London Traffic Act, 192^ - the advice of the London and HomeCounties Traffic Advisory Committee.
         The Minister, of course, appreciates that under theprocedure proposed the Council hopes by bringing all partiesinto close consultation to&apos; reduce disagreements and delays andthat it may therefore not be impossible for the Council to cometo a decision to promote legislation in the parliamentary session of 1931/32 by the date required in its Standing Orders.It will be seen, however, that the earliest date by which theRoyal Assent is likely to be secured for the Council&apos;s Billis the Summer of 19J2 or, roughly, two years from the presenttime.         The Council&apos;s proposals involve that both the presentand the next session of Parliament are lost, and the Ministercannot but confess to some concern at the time which must elapse under the Council&apos;s proposals in the most favourable circumstances before Parliamentary sanction can be secured toa Bill.         In regard to the suggestion of the Council that theMinister should be represented on the Advisory Committee, itivill be appreciated  that in view of the large traffic andfinancial considerations involved he must be free at the timethe scheme is submitted  to him:-       (l) to consider it upon its merits;  and       (2) to examine  it  from the financial aspect,  taking               into  account the position of  the Road Fund at that               time.         As the Council  is aware, His Majesty&apos;s Government attach great  importance to  the  construction of a Charing Cross Bridge atthe earliest practicable date, and  the Council may be sure thattheir  anxiety to see  this improvement effected continues.   TheMinister  is not disposed to  dissent from a procedure which hascommended itself to  the  Council  but in all  the circumstances he                                 1does not consider  that he should himself appoint  representatives to  serve as Members  of the Advisory Committee because  if he did so
20his discretion would inevitably he fettered  if and when the jfidvisoryCommittee is ab?-.e te- agyee upon a scheme 0  I am,however, to assure you that he will facilitate an:/ investigation  the Committee mayundertake &quot;by putting at its disposal all the information  andtechnical assistance available in the Ministry of Transport,         Mr. Morrison notes the reference  in the last paragraphof the Report of the Improvements Committee  to Waterloo Bridge,from which he gathers that it is not intended to deal withWaterloo Bridge until Parliamentary sanction is secured for  a road Bridge at Charing Cross. He is aware  of the concern  whjchthe state of Waterloo Bx-idge has long caused the Council  andhe assumes that it has satisfied itself that the Bridge will &quot;be safe during.the time contemplated by the Council before aCharing Cross Bridge Bill is passed into law,                                     I am, etc.The Clerk to the      London County Council,          County Hall,              So B. 10
