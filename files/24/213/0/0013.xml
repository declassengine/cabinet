THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  June 1930.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.     35O.P. 213 (30).                                 CABINET.DRAFT  BILL  TO  AMEND  THE  BRITISH NORTH  AMERICA ACTS,                                 1867-1916.       MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.    I SHOULD  like to call the attention of the Cabinet to a draft Bill which hasbeen prepared as the result of an address of the Senate  and Commons of canada to His Majesty the King,  praying that a measure may be introduced into Parliamenthere for an amendment of the British North America Acts, 1867-1916.    The  object of this Bill is merely to confirm and validate agreements concludedbetween the Dominion Government and certain of the provincial Governments forthe transfer to the latter of the administration of their own natural resources whichhad hitherto been administered by the former.  As this involves an amendment ofthe Canadian Constitution, which, under.the British North America Acts, Canadacannot do for  herself, an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom  is necessary;and the Canadian Government have expressed their urgent desire that the  requiredlegislation should receive the Royal Assent not earlier than the 1st and not later thanthe 15th July next, so  that it  may  coincide with the  60th  Anniversary of the foundation of the Province of Manitoba.    I am strongly of opinion that every effort should be  made to meet the requestof the Canadian Government. The ground which they give for making it is  in itself,from the Canadian point of view, a good reason for treating  this legislation as amatter of urgency.  From our point of view, a further reason for complying is thata general election in Canada is impending, and it would be very unfortunate if, at such a moment, we were to appear to hesitate to meet Mr. MacKenzie King&apos;s wishes.Moreover,  there  is now much  argument  in  Canada, whether  the necessity for reference to the Imperial  Parliament in the case of any amendment of the CanadianConstitution is consistent with the modern conception of Dominion status.  Thispoint was  raised in the  Debates in the Canadian Parliament about the presentpetition,  and is referred to in the Report of the Dominions Legislation Conferenceof  last  autumn.    In  present  circumstances,  it  would  obviously  be  extremelyinexpedient to give  a handle for  the suggestion that the procedure laid down by theBritish North America Acts is not only anomalous, but inconvenient in  practice,on  the ground that the pressure of Parliamentary business here has  the  effect ofdelaying  action which is  urgent  in Canadian interests.  There is no need to pointout hoAv unfortunate any such suggestion would be at a time when the whole questionof the powers in future of the Imperial Parliament is under discussion.    For  these reasons, and especially for the last, I feel that we  ought, even atinconvenience to ourselves, to comply with the request of the Canadian Governmentrespecting the date of this measured receiving the Royal Assent.    If the  Cabinet agree  in the above view, I should propose to arrange for the Billto be introduced  within  the next few  days in the  House of  Lords, and also to approach the leaders of the Opposition in the House of  Commons with a view to obtaining parliamentary  facilities for the rapid passage of the Bill.

Memorandum  of agreement arrived at regard ng the control of  5     the upper waters of the Winnipeg Rive .                            Present:    Representing the Dominion Govei nment :        Right Honourable Mackenzie King, Prime Minister ; Honour-            able Charles Stewart, Minister of the Interior; Mr. W. W. 10         Co y, Deputy Minister of the Interior.      In attendance :          Mr. W. J. Stewart and Mr. J.  B.

Rorke. 20 Representing the Province of Manitoba :        Honourable John Bracken, Premier.        Honourable R. W. Craig, Attorney-General; also        Honourable T. H. Johnson, K.C., Counsel.        This agreement, as a  working basis for the regulation of the 25 English and Winnipeg rivers, is entered into on the understanding    that all  parties are  agreeable to  the  repeal of the Lake of the    Woods Regulation Act, 1920, but Ontario does not bind itself    to the terms of this agreement in the event of that Act not being    repealed. 30     The Government representatives agreed that  the  general    advantage legislation could be  rescinded on the following basis    (Mr. Bracken undertaking to  urge the acceptance  thereof by the    Manitoba power interests) :    1. Control  of Lake of the  Woods :35     The recommendation of the Lake  of the Woods  Control    Board that the Norman Dam be  expropriated was agreed to in    principle.
A.D. 1930.      It was further understood that the Board should immediately   --     investigate and  report to the  three  governments  concerned,           -whether                (1) There is  some alternative method of securing control by                   construction of a new structure above the present dam 5                   or otherwise;               (2) Failing  such an alternative being found, under what                   procedure and whether under  Federal or  Provincial                   auspices, should the dam be expropriated.               The cost of  securing the results contemplated under either 10           (1) or (2) above should  be borne on the following basis :                One-third of the total cost to be attributable to navigation                   and borne by the Federal Government;               The  remaining two-thirds  to be considered chargeable  to                   power, to be borne in the first instance by the expropriating- 15                   priating Government, but                        (a)  Ontario to be responsible for the share charge-                     able to the undeveloped power site at White Dog Falls ;                        (6)  The Federal Government (as proprietors of the                     water powers on the Winnipeg river in Manitoba) 20                     to be  responsible in the first instance for the amount                     chargeable to the remaining  fall of  the Winnipeg river                     in the Province of Manitoba;  the  Department of the                     Interior to  recover  cost of same from  the present                     power developments on the river and from prospective 25                     power developments on such basis as that Department                     may consider advisable.               So far as the amount chargeable to power is concerned, the           basis of settlement between the Dominion Government and the           Province of Ontario should be that of the ratio of potential head 30           in Ontario and Manitoba.           2. Regulation under Concurrent Legislation :               It was agreed that the Lake of the Woods Control Board           should be instructed to immediately canvass the necessities  of           the situation and make  appropriate  recommendations  to the 35           Governments of Canada and Ontario with  a  view to  having           approved and authorized  whatever operating  regulations are           considered necessary to make practically effective the existing           concurrent legislation.           3. Lac Seul:                                                 40               With regard to storage on Lac Seul, it is agreed that if the           power interests in Manitoba or their administrative agency desire           storage on Lac Seul, they shall immediately notify the Government
\     of Ontario to this effect.  In the event of such notification the  A.D. 1930.     Government of Ontario shall undertake not to permit the con-     -      struction  of any development which would later be  destroyed,     wholly or in part, by the creation of this storage, and  shall agree   5 to grant flooding  rights,  on Crown Lands affected,  under the     customary conditions, including recompense for timber destroyed,     and the usual rental for water powers which may be wholly or     partially destroyed incidental to the  construction of the said     works.  Further, the power interests benefited shall  be prepared, 10 when  required by  the Government  of  Ontario, to pay the said     Government an amount to be ascertained by the Control Board,     sufficient to pay the difference between the cost of power feasible     of development at Pelican Falls and the cost of a similar amount     of power to be  developed at some other possible site designated 15 by the Government of Ontario and delivered at Sioux Lookout     at a distribution voltage.         It is agreed that whatever storage scheme may be worked     out covering Lac Seul shall be under the jurisdiction of the Lake     of the Woods Control Board, the cost  of the same  to be borne 20 by the power interests as and when  benefited.     4. International Questions :        With regard to the international issues it was unanimously     agreed that there was not sufficient data to enable a commitment     at the present  stage with regard to storage and regulation on 25  Rainy and upper international lakes, and that in any case all     the interests concerned, governmental, municipal, corporate and     private, on both sides of the boundary, should be afforded  the     opportunity and the advantage of presenting their views,  and of     hearing the views of others presented, to the International Joint 30  Commission.        It  was further  agreed that the basis  for an international     arrangement between the two countries arrived at by the technical     advisers of the United  States  and  Canada at Washington in     December, should be adhered to, namely :  35     ifl) An immediate settlement by treaty of the Lake  of the             Woods  issues; and        (6) Concurrent with the ratification  of&quot; such a treaty,  an             appropriate reference to  the International  Joint  Corn-             mission respecting Rainy and upper lakes matters.40     It was further agreed that once a reference of the upper lakes.    matter has been agreed to,  the Canadian Governments, Dominion    and Provincial, should facilitate in every possible way, a thorough    investigation and  an early report by  the  International  Joint    Commission, but that pending such  a report,  die Dominion45 Government could not make any commitment as  to policy-
    With regard to financial obligations arising voider settlementof the Lake of the Woods issues it was agreed that the sameshould be borne by the respective Governments on the same basis as that set out above for the acquirement of  the Norman Dam.
