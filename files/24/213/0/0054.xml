She Cabinet record of the discussion about my Bill toincrease the borrowing powers of the unemployment Fund contains the following:-          &quot;gtress was laid on the importance of the Government     spokesmen on the Bill being in a position to indicate, if     neoessary, what the ultimate policy of the Government was     to render the Unemployment Fund solvent and to avoid     periodical increases in its borrowing powers&quot;.     I think we must anticipate that questions on this point towhioh aai answer must be given will be raised during the debate on Friday, and I should be glad to receive advice as to the line to be taken.2.   She magnitude of the financial problems involved will beapparent when I say that to make the income and expenditurebalance at the present time, we should require an extra 25,000,000 per annum, and that the points on the Live Registerat whioh the Fund would balance with various amounts of additional revenue - but without making any provision for repayment of debt -would be as follows:-Additional0 ont r ih u c i ons.Penoe per week.Men.Equivalent amountOf adaiVb&apos;i&quot;6nal revenueforTEe Fund.&quot;Point on the Live&amp;egis^er at&apos;&apos;&quot;which- lie Fund would&quot;&apos;b alanc e&quot;&quot;wijpf this additional revenue.4*69        Women,                 ,          3               8,600,000             1,500,000          4i             11,600,000             1,570,000          6              17,000,000             1,700,000     In the above figures it is assumed that the fund will continue free of responsibility for the benefit ofthose who have not paid 30 contributions,   This is atpresent a charge on the Exchequer at the rate of nearly3,
it 71! 20,000,000  a year, which  is additional to  its  contributionto the Fund  on  the equal thirds basis, amounting to 16,000,000.     4.   Apart from reduction of expenditure there are only two ways of  making the Fund solvent, viz:-          (a) by an additional annual grant from the exchequer:       or (b) by raising the contributions from employers,              employed and the Exchequer.These alternatives were examined in March last  (C.P.97(30))in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs;  we were reluctantlydriven to the conclusion that we could not then recommendeither of the alternatives and the Cabinet accordinglyapproved an  increase of the borrowing powers from 40,000,000  to  50,000,000.  These questions were again before the Cabinet in June, ( CP.219(30) ).   It was then decided to increase the borrowing powers to  60,000,000.     5,    While it is obvious that the Fund cannot be financed on borrowed money indefinitely and that we shouldbe driven later to adopt some other alternative, we are not,I think, in a position now to announce &quot;our ultimate policy.........c.............  to render the Unemployment Fundsolvent and to avoid periodical increases in its borrowing powers&quot;.     60    The matter is,  of course,  bound up to some extentwith the consideration of the relief of the able-bodiedgenerally,  on which I have just circulated an importantPaper:  it is unlikely,  however,  that decisions on this paper will be available for my guidance before Friday.   As at                                              /present
       present advised, if I am asked during the Debate to say       what  the Government have in mind  about the Unemployment       Fund,  I should propose  to reply to  the effect *           &quot;that  the Government are,  of  course, fully  alive  to             the serious position of  the  Fund;   the  immediate cause             of difficulty is the phenomenal  rise in the Live             Register, brought  about  in the main by  world  causes;             whatever views might be  held as  to  the  moment at which             an improvement in  general trade  conditions may be             expected, nobody is pessimistic  enough  to  deny that             we may confidently look  for  that improvement,  in vdiich             event the present  heavy  charges  upon the Fund will             drop  rapidly;  in  the meantime,  those who  are unemployed             owing to the depression  are  drawing maintenance, thus             maintaining tho level of home  purchasing power.   The             steps to be taken  regarding  the  permanent  unemployment             insurance schome cannot  bo considered apart from the             question of the able-bodied  unemployed  generally; both             matters are engaging the earnest attention of the             Departments affected;  naturally the abnormal unemployment             situation increases the  complexity  of a subject  which in             any case raises many very difficult questions;   while,             obviously, steps will have to  be taken  to  put the scheme             in balance, it would be  unfortunate if  any attempt were             made  to do so in the present atmosphere;   anything said             or done now as to  the particular remedies  to  be  applied             might prejudice the position and make a satisfactory             solution difficult under more  favourable conditions;  in             our consideration we are naturally  giving, and shall             continue to give,  attention  to the  finances of the Fund.&quot;             I should welcome the views of my colleagues upon  this       statement.
