Memorandum &quot;by the First Commissioner of Works.lo             I desire to  call the attention of the Cabinet  to     the fact that a serious state of  unrest has manifested itself     in the London industrial depots of H.M., Office of Works In     consequence of the new method.of  recruiting staff from     ex-Regulars in accordance  with the policy  laid down  for  all     Government Departments In Treasury Circular Ho* 1/30,  a  copy     of which is attached0So             When the Circular was issued I took strong     exception to it, but I was. assured by the  Chancellor of  the     Exchequer that the policy involved no departure from the     general  practice of Government Departments.   Although I  was     not fully satisfied, I assented to the instructions  in  the     Circular being observed In the Office of Works and     Departmental instructions were circulated accordingly at the     beginning of Aprils,   A copy of the  correspondence between  the     Chancellor and myself  is attachedo30             Protests were immediately  made by the Shop Stewards     who represent the men in the depots.  The matter was also     tabled for discussion at the Departmental  Joint Industrial     Council by the Trade Union Side and the following is an     extract from the minutes of the Joint meeting held on the     30th April lasts-                    &quot;The Trade Union Side referred to recent          Instructions  regarding the employment  of ex-soldiers          in Government Departments and were informed that -the          regulations had  been  issued  by the Government and that                                                      the
414     the Council had no discretion in the mattere    The     Vice-Chairman stated that they desired to enter a strong     protest against the setting aside of vacancies in     Government Industrial Establishments to he filled in     this manner.&quot;          Since that meeting the feeling of discontentamongst the industrial grades in my Department has becomeintensified as a result of the actual appointment of ex-Regulars to vacant posts and a number&apos; of personalrepresentations has been made by individual Members ofParliament to me to abandon the new policy,   A mass meetingof Office of Works workmen stated to have been attended by800 men was held in London on the 3.0th July and on the11th July a deputation of 11 Trade Union officials whose members are employed in the Office of Works&apos; depots waited onme at the House of Commons,   The Unions represented were asfollows 8-.     (a)  National Federation of Building Trade Operatives,     (b)  Transport and General Workers6 Union0     (c)  Enginemen and..Firemen*s Union,,     (&amp;)  Electrical Trades Unione     (e)  Amalgamated Engineering Union,,,     (f)  National Union of Government and Municipal Workers,     (g)  Union of Postal Workers,     (h)  National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association,The deputation was introduced by Mre Gardner, M.P,, and included Mr, Wall ace i0 M.P0          The chief point voiced by  the deputation was thatthe rank  and file held very  strongly that it was grosslyunfair  to give preference of  employment  to  ex-Regulars inview of the  existing unemployment position,  especially as some of the  ex-Regulars  were in receipt  of  a  service pension,                                                      Mr,
415     Mr, Wallace pointed out, that the Office of Works  went further     than the Post Office who did not give an exclusive preference     to ex-Regulars hut reserved a proportion of posts for their     boy messengers0   The deputation also stated that the feeling     against the policy was intensified by reason of the fact that-     many of the new ex-Regular entrants were non-Unionistsfl  As a     result feeling was running high in the depots and the Trade     Union Officials were having difficulty In restraining the men     from taking immediate strike aotionc               I promised, the deputation I would take immediate     steps to have the matter reconsidered., but I declined to agree     to their request to suspend the operation of the Circular in     the meantime06*             My own view is that the arrangements laid down in     the Circular are Inappropriate for the Office of Works Industry     Establishments4   My grounds for this view are as follows?&quot;       (a)  So far as my information goes there are large numbers             of ex-Regulars available for employment who enlisted             before November, 19180  In practice, therefore,, all             vacancies  (except in some special cases of skilled             tradesmen  to which further reference is made below).             are being filled from this category of men because             the other  categories would be utilised only if there             are none of the first category available *       (b)  This system of compulsory first preference to             ex-Regulars  (except In the limited number of posts             for which  service in the Regular Forces gives             special  qualification,, e0go,, P ark-keep er ship a) is             definitely a new departure  so far as my Department             is  concerned.,  I appreciate  fully the weighty  .             considerations which can be  adduced In  favour  of             giving preferential treatment to  ex-Regulars in  the             matter  of  Government employment^ but I  suggest that
                                                 416 the Government?s obligations in this respect can he adequately met &quot;by confining compulsory preferential employment for ex-Regulars to the industrial and other establishments of the Service Departments, and to other- Departments where the praotioe is already well establishesThe work done in the industrial establishments of the Office of Works is definitely civil work and is  in a different category from that performed by Industrial grades in Woolwich Arsenal and the Dockyards for the Service Departments,  Prior to 1920, the work now carried out by the Offioe of Works industrial staff was in the main, exeouted by Contract Labours and the contractors staffs were taken into direct. employment in that year.  Consequently the men are used to ordinary industrial methods of staff-recruitment, viz,, through the local Employment Exchanges, and the change in the method of recruitment has naturally led to discontent,I gather that one reason why the workmen are 30 bitterly opposed to the new scheme is that there is a wide spread belief that the policy of employing ex-Regulars is part of a deep laid scheme to undermine the strong shop steward and Trade Union organisation in Government industrial establishments as it is generally believed that for the most part ex-Regulars are either hostile to or at any rate out of sympathy with shop steward and Trade Union ideals0 It Is not possible to remove this belief from the minds of the rank and file of the men and unless the present grievance can be remedied it Is inevitable that it will continue to be a source of irritation and friction, even if no actual strike  occurs,                                              (e)

In the Circular should not be exclusively reserved for ex-Regulars for similar reasons $. but as the non- Industrial grades concerned in my Department have no made any protest against the new policys so far as I am aware,, I would not propose to make any alteration except to reserve to myself the right to appoint- other than an ex-Regular in cases where I consider such a course to be expedient.The course for which I ask the approval of the Oabinefor the exclusion of the Office of iorks industrialohm ante from the operation of the Circular,, eitherntly or until the whole matter has been reconsidered,                                   SoLo                                   13th July, 19 30.
K,M. OFFICE OF WORKS,     STOREY*S GATE,15th. January, 1950.Dear snowden,          My attention has been drawn to Treasury CircularUOo 1/30t dated the 1st January. 1930,   As I understand them,the proposed new regulations for filling subordinate posts in Government departments by ex-Regular Sailors, Soldiers and airmen, will practically debar the civil population from any opportunity of appointments to a-very large number of posts.In my view this is open to serious objection,, and I am convinced that it would not meet with the approval of thepresent House of Commons.          I think there is a very definite distinction to bedrawn between &quot;ex-regulars&quot; and &quot;ex-service51 men, if by thelatter term is meant the civilian -population who served as-temporary soldiers during the Great War,   It has beangenerally recognised that the last-mentioned class has a claim for preferential treatment by the Governments but I see no adeq.uat ? grounds for extending this preferential treatment to ex-regular men at the expense of the general body ofunemployed,          I find that linder the regulations which mydepartment is at present observing, non-service men arealready debarred from a substantial number of subordinateposts.   For example, all park-keepers are recruited fromex-regulars who have reached the rank of sergeant;  in allunskilled industrial grades preference is normally given to ex-service men, and, where possible, this applies to skilledindustrial grades,   Liftmen9a posts are reserved for disabled ex-service men and for directly employed men disabled in thecourse of their duty, and all messengers&apos; posts are reservedfor ex-service men,..          The new regulations do not appear to allow mydepartment in future to appoint to a liftman&quot;s pest a-directly employed man who has been disabled or who becomesunfit for his ordinary duties,.   I think departments ought tobe permitted to do this when neoessary, if only to obviatepayments under the Workman&apos;s Compensation Aot,   Emergenciessometimes arise when a nightwatchman or a stoker is required at once, and a, man must then be obtained from any sourceavailable, irrespective of whether or not he is an ex-regular.If the .joh were likely to last some time, presumably thespirit of the new regulations would require that an ex-regularshould be obtained as soon as possible and the temporary mandischarged.   This procedure, I think, would be rather unfair to the man to be discharged.          I should perhaps also mention that at the request of miss Bondfield, 50fo of the vacancies for semi-permanentindustrial posts in the Offloe of Works London depots arebeing reserved for men from the depressed mining areas,I fancy that the Minister of Labour may take strong exoeptioxiif this arrangement is oancelied without notice as apparentlyis intended by the Circular.O     OOPX.
          I aa informed that the Circular follows  the lineslaid down by the late Cabinet;  but in view of theconsideration above stated,,  I am strongly of opinion that  the circular ought not to have been issued without authority fromthe present Cabinet,.   In the meantime, therefore, I haveissued instructions that so far as the Office of Works isconcernedj  the old regulations are to continue in  force*          Finally, I think some further consideration of thematter is necessary as it affects the Government WhitleyCouncilso   In the list of objects included in theconstitution of the Office of Works Departmental iVhitleyCouncil is  the following clause, viz i-     &quot;-The consideration of the conditions of entry into and      training in the various establishments concerned, in      conjunction with the Trade Joint Councils where      necessaryofi          Criticism from the Trades Unions Is inevitable ifthe new. regulations are put into operation., end in my view there is every reason that the necessary discussion with theUnion should precede, rather than follow, an. innovation suchas is now proposed,,                         Yours truly,                              (Sgdc)   GEORGE LANSBURY*ie Rt0 hon Philip Snow&amp;en, MePo,   HoMo Treasury,,
TREASURY CHAMBERS,      WHITEHALL,  S.W.I.29th January, 1930Dear George?          I have considered the views expressed in your letterof the 15th January about the provision to be made for theemployment of ex-regular sailors, soldiers and airmen inGovernment Departments.          It is incorrect to assume that the Treasury Circularof the 1st January, 1930, to which you take exception, marks anentirely new departure.  The practice of giving preferential treatment to ex-regulars in respect of employment in GovernmentDepartments is generations old.  The effect of the recent -Treasury Circular on the subject is merely to regularize the traditional policy by defining the various classes of civil employment to which it would appropriately be applied.          You will observe that the arrangements prescribed bythe Circular provide (a) that the existing preference accorded to &quot;ex-service&quot; men and to disabled ex-service men in particularshall remain intact, and (b) that in filling vacancies due regard shall be paid to the claims of persons already in theServiceo  Under the latter of these provisions you would clearly be entitled (as indeed you would have been even if the Circularhad contained no such provision) to appoint to a lift-man&apos;spost a directly employed man who had been disabled or becomeunfit for his ordinary duties.          As to the merits of the traditional policy of giving a preference to ex-regulars in certain areas of Government iemployment, it must be remembered that recruitment to the three fighting  Services would inevitably suffer if no such provisionwere made.   It might also be argued that in according thispreference  the Government is doing no more than a good employershould do.  I understand that about 35,000 men leave theFighting  Services every year and become part of the general bodyof unemployed - the majority long before they reach middle-ageoIt would  hardly be creditable to the Government as employer to deny to these men a preferential chance of obtaining further government  employment In a civil capacityprovided always theyare fully qualified.          My chief responsibility in this matter  is to  securewell qualified recruits for the various branches  of the CivilService,  and if the aocepted policy of preferential treatment,&apos;whether for ex-service men or for ex-regulars, is to be brought under review,&apos; the matter does not lie solely or perhaps evenmainly within the  jurisdiction  of the Chancellor&quot;of theExchequer but concerns also the Ministerial Heads of the  three fighting  Services.  Unless and until the traditional policy ischanged,  2  do not think any exception can be taken to  thearrangements laid down in the Treasury circular.  ,                        Your s .. s ino ere ly,                              (Sgdo) PHILIP SHOWDEN.Right Hon.

HoMo OFFICE OF WORKS,      STOREY5s GATE,            S0W.I087th February, 1950My dear Philip,          I have now had time to go into the points youraise in your letter of the 29th January last on theemployment of ex-Regular Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen0I must say that although I accept your decision, I amsorry that you have not been able to see your way to treat Ex-Service men and civilians more on an equalfootingo  I think that a man who has worked well onoivil employment, has served the State in no less a degree than those who have served under Arms0          There is one point., however, that I think ought to make clear 0  If the matter had. be en one raei*elyof more accurately defining the position as it existedheretofores i should, not have felt it incumbent upon meto raise it..  The Treasury circular of the 1st January1950, doesj however, make a very large incursion into certain employments where it was hitherto permissibleto employ civilians.  From now onwards they will be debarred from these posts unless no suitable ex-serviceman is available.  The nett result of this, as of all-oases of preferential treatment3 will of course, bethat we shall not necessarily get tha best man for thepost o                    Yours very truly,                        (Sgdo)  Go LANSBURYoe  Horic  Philip  Snowden, MoPo, Treasury Chamber s,      S c W o 1 o

T am directed  by the  Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury to inform you that His Majesty&apos;s Government have  had under review the  arrangements  for  providing employment for ex-Regular  Sailors,  Soldiers  and Airmen in Government  Departments.    2.  It has been decided that, in  filling subordinate posts in Government departments of the types indicated  in  paragraph 4 for which  adult recruitment  is the rule and whichprima  facie could be  suitably filled  by duly  qualified candidates  who  have served in theRegular  Forces of the Crown, consideration should first be given to such candidates providedthat-         (1) the existing  preference accorded to ex-service  men, including the preference     given to disabled men, in regard to Government employment will  be  maintained;         (2) in cases where the vacancies are of the  kind filled alternatively by transfer,     promotion or recruitment from outside,  due  regard will  be  paid to  the  claims  of     candidates already serving;         (3) where necessary, a limit may be placed on the number of persons employed     in  a Department who may at any one time be subject to Reserve liability.    3.  In applying this decision the  machinery of the Ministry of Labour and the national association  for Employment  of  Regular Sailors,  Soldiers and Airmen  will  be  used.Accordingly, in future, vacancies in  suitable posts, with the  exception stated below, shouldbe notified in the form annexed to this Circular,  to the Divisional Office  (London) or theEmployment Exchanges (provinces).   The order of preference already laid down in respect  ofemployment in  the  Post Office  will be followed, viz. :           (1)  Ex-regulars  (including boys) who enlisted on or before 11th  November, 1918.         (2)  &quot; Ex-hostilities  only &quot;  men.         (3)  Ex-regulars  (including  boys) who enlisted after 11th November, 1918.   Vacancies for unestablished messengers in  London  will   continue,  as  heretofore,   tobe notified to and filled through the medium of the Joint Substitution B,oard.   4.  The types of posts to which these arrangements will apply are posts for                            Messengers,                           Porters,                           Male  Cleaners,                           Night Telephonists,                           Liftmen,                           Labourers,                           Warehousemen,                           Night Watchmen,
                            Batmen,                                                  &apos;^J^                            Waiters,                            Storekeepers,                            Laboratory  Attendants,                            Watchers,                            Museum Attendants and Warders,                            Caretakers,and posts in industrial establishments for  which ex-regulars possess suitable  qualifications.    The  maintenance  of  separate  Departmental  Waiting  Lists  for  these  posts  will  be discontinued.    5.  A small inter-departmental standing  committee has  been set up to deal with  such adjustments  in points of detail  as may from  time to time be  necessary.   In any case  of doubt  Departments should  communicate with  the  Secretary,  Employment of  ex-RegularsStanding Committeei,  Treasury,  S.W.I.
