Memorandum by the financial  Secretary tq.....the Treasur y,(Circulated by direction of  the Chancellor of the Exchequer).          This is an annual Bill confirming the CustomsResolutions of the Manx legislature and it requires verylittle explanation.   The Isle of Man has a separate financialexistence, levying its own taxes and defraying its own expen-diture.   In particular, it is completely free as to Customsduties, subject to confirmation by the Imperial Parliament.It would be unprecedented for Parliament to alter the duties.          The effect of the Resolutions confirmed by this bill is substantially to impose the same Customs tariffas is in force in this country.   The Safeguarding duties on lace, cutlery, gloves and gas mantles are repealed at the dates of the intended expiry of the corresponding dutieshere.   The duty on Beer is increased by 3/- the standardbarrel in conformity with the recent increase in the Imperialbeer duties. -  The Insular Duty as increased remains as in previous years slightly below the Imperial Duty.   The dutyon spirits is raised to the Imperial level, the increaserepresenting an additional 5/- the proof gallon to theformer Insular duties.   The Customs duty on &quot;Sweets&quot;(British wines) which corresponds to-our Excise duty in this
country was put below that Excise duty for technical reasonsin 1929 and this arrangement continues.   The duty onhydrocarbon oils which lapsed in the Island on lot August1929 is reimposed as from 28th March 1930.   There are noduties in the Island on sugar, table waters, dried fruits,and wrapping paper.   On all other  articles (except coffeeand chicory, the duties on which are slightly lower in the island) , the duties will be at Imperial rates.          The Bill is practically formal and occupies littleParliamentary time.   It should, however, be passed beforethe Summer adjournment because the Tynwald resolutions.which were passed in March and June are only operative for six months.          The authority of tho Cabinet is requested tointroduce the Bill and proceed with it at once subjectto any drafting or other minor amendments which may befound necessary or desirable.   In view of its uncontrovarsinature the Bill has not been referred to the Home AffairsCommittee .                          (3d.)   F.W.  PETHICK LAV.BEH0E.Treasury Chambers,     30th June,  1930 .
