(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT).                  &quot;                      CABINET.SECRET.                                        COPY NO.  3 T *CP. 247 (50).           MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT.           CO-ORDINATION OF LONDON PASSENGER TRAFFIC         In CP.2l6(30) of 23rd June last, I drew attention to various reasons of polioy and also of immediatepractical importance which led me to ask for an assurance that time would he found for legislation next session on thesubject of the co-ordination of London Passenger Transport.         As I explained, negotiations have recently beenbegun between the Underground Company (the holding Company ofthe Combine) and the Metropolitan Railway Company, with a view -to the control of the latter Company being acquired by theformer.   I understand that the suggestion is that the underground Company should acquire a majority of the stocks  ofthe Metropolitan Company carrying voting rights by issuing tothe present holders stock carrying a guaranteed rate of Interestwith possibly a further participation in profits of a nature notyet defined.         Sir Y/illiam McLintock advises me that, if the proposed arrangement were carried through, it would probably result in alarge increase in the price which the proposed Traffic authority would have to pay for the Metropolitan Railway Undertaking.         A large increase in the market value of the stocks  ofthe Metropolitan Railway, to which would probably have to beadded a sympathic increase in the market values of the variouscommon fund companies belonging to the Underground Group, would thus occur on the eve of negotiations for the transitr of the undertakings to a public body, and unless the Government were ina position to insist that any appreciation in values occurring.
subsequent to a given date should be disregarded in fixing theprice of transfer to the public body, the cost  of socialisingthe London traffic services would be increased  by a veryconsiderable sum.         Further if, by the time that the Traffic Authority is.formed the fusion of interests between the Underground Group andthe Metropolitan has resulted in economies and  thus in higherprofits being earned, the Traffic Authority might be ashed to pay more for the undertakings, notwithstanding the  fact that the economies would have accrued in any event to the TrafficAuthority.         The Underground Company have informally inquired whatwould be the Government&apos;s attitude towards their proposal, andafter consulting Sir V/illiam HcLintock I have authorised him to reply that the particular proposal is not one of which theGovernment could approve, having regsrd to the  possibleacquisition of the undertakings concerned by a  public trafficauthority in accordance with the announced intention of theGovernment.         I understand from Lord Ashfield that he will not proceed with any proposal if he is told that the government cannot approve it, and that the Traffic Authority is to be formedshortly.         But if we object, even for good reason, to any arrangements between existing interests and do  not proceed atan early date with our own plan we may be charged with havingspoilt the chances of an important advance towards co-ordinationof London passenger transport.   I ought therefore to be able totell Lord Ashfield definitely what our intentions are.         I expect shortly to receive Sir William ivicLintock&apos;sReport, after which it will be desirable for me to open upnegotiations with the private and municipal interests concerned
and I should like to make progress during the Parliamentary-Recess.   It is for this reason also necessary that the cabinet should now take a decision in order that I may proceed with authority.     Political Aspects.         As indicated in my memorandum of the 23rd June our own policy is in principle similar to that outlined in the LiberalYellow Book, and in view of the urgency of the matter it isdoubtful whether the Conservative Opposition would ba in aposition to make a real fight against our proposals.         I feel vary strongly that it would be beneficial to the spirit of our own party if a socialist measure of this character were brought forward, especially as we have not yetbeen able to bring forward any definite socialist legislation.I personally, and the substantial body of the party representingconstituencies in Greater London, v/ill be placed in great difficulties if we do not go forward next session, especially^as we have rejected the Traffic Co-ordination Bills,  whilsta measure of this kind will be a valuable contribution to theconstructive, practical and businesslike application ofsocialist principles by achieving the public ownership of agreat public utility under a public corporation, serving a population approaching 10 millions.   The enterprise  would have every prospect of success and it would form a valuable precedent in furthering other schemes of public ownership, e.g.  electricity supply.         On the 14th November, 1^29, the Cabinet approved theReport of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on London Traffic, CP.505(29),among the conclusions of which was:    &quot;There is an urgent need for a wide measure of co-ordination         of the undertakings engaged in passenger transport in         the London Traffic Area&quot;.
         In all the circumstances,  I earnestly trust  that my colleagues will decide that a London Traffic Bill  shallbe included in the King&apos;s Speech next session and that  authority may be given to me to make the necessary announcement as tothe decision of the Government to go forward in order that Imay enter upon negotiations firmly and confidently with theinterests concerned.,                           (Intld)   K.M.18.7. 30.
