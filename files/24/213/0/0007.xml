THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the  Cabinet.  June 1930.SECRET.COPY  NO.30CP. 207 (30).CABINET.IRAQ TREATY  NEGOTIATIONS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    I CIRCULATE for the consideration of my colleagues a further memorandum prepared in my Department on the above subject.  It is important that conclusions should,  if possible, be reached  at  the next meeting of the Cabinet on the points raised in the memorandum.    WHEN the Cabinet last had this question before them on the 28th May, itwas understood that King Faisal would be leaving Iraq for Europe during the first week in June, and thus that, unless the Treaty negotiations could be brought to a conclusion within the next few days, they wouid have to be suspended and resumedlater  on King faisals arrival  in  London.   The  situation  has since altered.King Faisal has modified his plans and now proposes to remain in Iraq until the23rd June.    2.   The High Commissioner  has reported that he is hopeful that the negotia-tions may be brought to a successful issue before King Faisal leaves, provided that two outstanding points, upon which complete  deadlock exists  at  present, can be disposed of in the meantime.  These two points concern (1) the duration of the new treaty,  and (2)  the  question  of  liability  for  the  cost  of  providing  alternative accommodation for the R.A.F. when they are withdrawn from their present stations at Mosul and Hinaidi.  There  are two other outstanding  questions of some importance, but these present rather less difficulty.   They will be discussed later inthis Memorandum.    3.   It will be recollected that in the Memorandum circulated to the Cabinet bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 17th May it was recommended that thenew Treaty should be of indefinite duration, but that the High Contracting parties should have the right, at any time after the expiration of a period of 25 years, to demand that negotiations be opened with a view to its revision,  and that in case of disagreement the difference should be submitted to the Council of the League. Thisproposal was based on the arrangement contemplated in the recent negotiations withthe Egyptian  Government.  Its effect would be that the Alliance with Iraq would continue indefinitely unless terminated or revised either by agreement or as a resultof reference  to the League Council.  The grounds upon which a more  or  lesspermanent Alliance with Iraq was considered to be desirable were explained by theSecretary of State for the Colonies in paragraph 15 of the Memorandum.   Of these,perhaps the most  important was  the consideration that, in default of a formal(Initialled)P.Colonial Office, June 16,  1930.TREATY NEGOTIATIONS WITH IRAQ.[21235]B
Alliance,  His Majesty&apos;s Government could not, without contravening the acceptedprinciples of neutrality, retain British forces in Iraq or make military use of Iraqiterritory in the event of a war in which this country, but not Iraq, was engaged.     4.  The High Commissioner was instructed to submit the above proposal to theIraq Government.  The text of  the Article which he was directed to negotiate willbe found  in Appendix  A.  He has now reported that the Iraq Government have refused to accept the proposal.   Although they appreciate that a permanent alliance with this  country will probably prove necessary,  they are unwilling, by the presenttreaty,  to bind their successors in  advance to  the acceptance of this princeple as inevitable.  King Faisal himself has emphatically stated that he has no intentionof terminating the Alliance.  On the contrary, he considers that, in the interests ofIraq, the  Alliance should continue for fifty or 100 years.  But this,  he  feels, will follow automatically if  the Treaty has in fact worked  satisfactorily  throughout theintervemag period.     Provided, however,  that a definite period of twenty-five years is put to the Treaty,King Faisal and  his Prime Minister are quite prepared to include in it a provision whereby, after the expiration of twenty years, negotiations would be opened for theconclusion of a new Treaty which would  provide for the continued maintenance and protection of Imperial  air communications, and,  in the event of a disagreement asto the measures necessary for this purpose, for a reference to the League of Nations.They are  willing also to recognise in the Treaty that the permanent maintenance ofImperial  air communications is essential  to  both  parties.  This, they appreciate,would, in  practice, involve a permanent Alliance; but, doubtless  for political reasons,they are not prepared expressly to recognise this  fact in the Treaty.     5.  An alternative  draft Article based upon the  Iraq Governments proposal has been prepared and will be found in Appendix B.  The text  of this  draft Articlehas been communicated to the High Commissioner, who has reported that, in hisopinion, it would be acceptable to the. Iraq Government.  A comparison of the twotexts suggests that there is  no  very  vital difference between  them.   The arrange-ment contemplated  in the  revised draft has, indeed,  certain concrete advantages.For example, whereas under the original draft, theoretically at least, it would havebeen open to the Council of the League after an interval  of  twenty-five years to declare that the Alliance was no longer required  and to exclude from consideration the necessity fof  making adequate provision for the maintenance and  protection ofImperial communications, under the revised draft any  decision  given by the council would necessarily have to be conditioned  by this requirement, and, as Imperial com-munications through and over Iraq obviously could not be made use of by british forces in the event of war unless Iraq was an ally,  it should not be difficult for HisMajesty&apos;s Government,  if  the  necessity  arose, to establish the fact that the con-tinuance of the Alliance is essential to the maintenance of those communications.     6.  There is a further consideration.  A quarter of a century is a long time to lookahead.  The situation changes rapidly in the Middle East, and it is  impossible nowto foresee what  will be the position by  the end of  that period.  It is at leastconceivable  that  before that period  has ended His Majesty&apos;s Government mightthemselves welcome an  opportunity to escape from their defence responsibilities inrespect of Iraq.  Again, it might be argued that by attempting to bind Iraq to thiscountry too closely we should in practice actually weaken the ties.  It may be moreimportant to gain the goodwill of the Iraq Government than to obtain formal treatysafeguards.  This,   at  any rate, was the  view  of the late  Sir  Gilbert Clayton.Whatever might be our  Treaty rights, there can be little doubt that, if British forces were to remain in Iraq without the full consent  and approval  of the  Iraq Govern-ment, some means would eventually be found of  forcing them to leave the country.They could not remain there indefinitely  in the face of  Iraqi hostility and persistentpropaganda and  agitation.     7.  These considerations seem to point to the advisability of meeting the wishes of  the  Iraq Government  in the matter  of the duration of the  treaty, and  ofauthorising the High Commissioner to accept a provision on the lines of the draftArticle in Appendix B.  This course would not, it is suggested, be inconsistent with paragraph (d)  of the Cabinet conclusions of the  28th  May, which directed that noarrangements should be made with Iraq  which  would react unfavourably on  ourposition in the event of a resumption  of the negotiations with Egypt.   The two
proposals  are sufficiently similar, and  the  points  of difference between  the  twocountries sufficiently marked, to render any unfavourable reaction upon the Egyptiansituation unlikely.    8.  At their meeting of the 28th May the Cabinet decided that any settlement with Iraq should provide for a satisfactory contribution by the Iraq government towards the cost of alternative accommodation for the Royal Air Eorce when with-drawn from  Mosul  and Hinaidi.   In  pursuance  of  this decision,  the HighCommissioner was instructed to  attempt to negotiate a  Clause with the  IraqGovernment which would provide that the aerodromes, cantonments, &amp;c, at present occupied by British forces at Mosul and Hinaidi would be handed over to  the IraqGovernment  free of  charge,  and  in  consideration  thereof  the&apos; Iraq Governmentwould accept, in principle,  liability for the provision of the necessary  alternative accommodation for those forces.  The High Commissioner now reports that unlessHis Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to reconsider their  decision a  completedeadlock will be reached with the Iraq Government.  Both King Faisal and  his prime Minister have made  it clear in  private conversation  that the Iraq Govern-ment are quite unable to accept this liability even in principle.  They regard it  notonly as inequitable, but also as beyond  their means.  The High Commissioner  has asked  for authority to  omit from the Treaty all reference to this question of  the incidence of cost.     He proposes that an article should be included in the Treaty which would, ineffect,  provide  that  any  financial  questions  outstanding  between  the HighContracting Parties on the date of its entry into force should be settled by separate agreement, or, in default of agreement,  by arbitration.  He argues that it would inany case be difficult to draft and negotiate a financial agreement before the treaty is ratified, and that  under his suggestion neither party would  be committed  andthere would be ample time for full consideration of the financial questions on their merits.     9.  From one point of view the High Commissioners proposal to omit from theTreaty any express mention of this liability would seem to have some advantage.The provision originally proposed, whereby the Iraq Government&apos;s acceptance of  thisliability would have been  in principle only,  might have  conveyed  the implicitsuggestion that the liability would not  in practice be met by them in full; and  this might  to some extent  have  prejudiced  our  position  vis-a-vis the  egyptian government.     Moreover, the High Commissioners proposal would at least leave His Majesty&apos;sGovernment entirely  free to demand at  some future date, should they see fit to do so,that this liability be accepted in full  by the  Iraq Government.  This they couldscarcely have done under the  original proposal.     The High Commissioners further proposal referred to at the end of paragraph 8above, appears, however, open to serious objection.   The probable effect would be toencourage the Iraq Government to block any attempt to settle this question of the incidence   of  cost  until   the  new   Treaty  had   entered  into   force   anduntil  Iraq   had been  admitted  into&apos; the  League.   Our bargaining   positionthen  would  be  much  weaker  than  it  is  to-day.  His   Majesty&apos;s   Govern-ment  could not, it is true, make the  prior disposal of this question a condition of supporting Iraq&apos;s candidature for admission to  the League  of Nations  in 1932. They have already promised  that support unconditionally.  But there can be little doubt that the  candidature of Iraq would  be unsuccessful  if there were no Treaty settlement with this  country providing for  a measure of British protection against external  aggression.   From this it seems to follow that if  we  are to preserve our bargaining position intact,  it is important that we should insist upon a settlement of this question before the Treaty actually enters into force.     On the other hand, there is much to be said for omitting an express reference to this question from the  Treaty at the present stage.   Iraq is at the moment in most serious financial straits.  In their present  condition of acute  financial stringency the Iraq Government could scarcely be expected to  accept now any substantial  new financial commitment.    It is to be hoped, however, that  this situation  will not continue for long.  Sir E. Hilton Young is now consulting with the Iraq Government as to the best means of meeting  the financial crisis.   With his help the position should gradually be  remedied, and in a few years&apos; time Iraq should be restored to prosperity.   It is perhaps  not too much to hope  that the Iraq Government will  then be less  unwilling  to make a substantial  contribution to  the cost  of alternative       [21235]                                            .

accommodation for the Eoyal Air Force.  But if they were to accept this liability,even in principle,  at the present juncture, it seems almost certain that their action would be disavowed by the country at large and the Treaty thrown out by the IraqiParliament.   It appears desirable, therefore, to play for time while preserving ourbargaining position intact by providing that this and other outstanding financial questions shall be settled before the Treaty enters into force.     10.  This might .be done, it is suggested, by negotiating an exchange of noteswith the Iraq Government, to be appended to the  Treaty, placing it on record thatall outstanding financial questions, including those which it is necessary to settlefor the purpose of the operation of the Treaty and its Military Appendix, shallform the subject of a separate Agreement, which shall be deemed to be an integral part of the Treaty and shall be ratified simultaneously with the Treaty.  Under thisproposal, the  Iraq Governments objection to the  original provision would to someextent be met  without in any way weakening our position to negotiate a satisfactory settlement  before the Treaty enters into force.  It is recommended that the HighCommissioner should be authorised to negotiate an exchange of notes on this basis.     11.  There  are two other points of  disagreement.   The  Iraq Governmentdefinitely decline to grant to His Majesty&apos;s Government the permanent lease of sites for land and seaplane bases in the neighbourhood  of Basra, and they have rejected the proposal to postpone a decision with regard to the evacuation of Hinaidi untilfive years after the date of the entry into force of the Treaty.     As regards the first point, they are perfectly willing to grant a lease for thefull duration of the treaty (i.e., for twenty-five years), but for the same reasons whichprompted them to demand that the Treaty should be of fixed duration they refuseto consider the grant of a permanent lease for a  British air base in Iraq.  Theirattitude is logical, and if the recommendation made above in regard to the duration of the Treaty  is accepted, there would be little object in attempting to secure a lease of an air base in perpetuity.  If the Alliance were to  come to an end after twenty-five years,  British  force would in any case have to be withdrawn from Iraq, andthe permanent lease of an air base would be valueless.  In the circumstances, it is recommended  that  the Iraq Governments offer of a twenty-five years&apos; lease shouldbe accepted, but that arrangements should be made in the separate financial agree-ment,  referred to in paragraph 10 above, which would safeguard His Majesty&apos;sGovernment against the possibility of the Iraq Government demanding the paymentof an exorbitant rental upon the renewal of the lease twenty-five years hence.     12.  In regard to the second point of disagreement mentioned above, the IraqGovernment have stated emphatically that there  is no prospect whatever of theirrequesting British air forces to remain at Hinaidi, and they are unalterably opposedto including any mention of this possibility in the Treaty. They wish a definite period to be fixed within which the E.A..F. should  withdraw both from Hinaidi andMosul.  Although  they have suggested that this period shall be  fixed  at one year after the entry into force of the Treaty in the case of Mosul, and two years in thecase of Hinaidi, the High Commissioner thinks it probable that they would, in fact,accept a maximum period of five years in both cases.     The suggestion of an alternative station for the R.A.F. in Central Iraq, West ofthe Euphrates, was discussed with the Iraq Government, and the High Commissionerreports that they approved it, not only ungrudgingly,  but with alacrity.   The HighCommissioner has  reiterated his view that  the complete  withdrawal of theBritish forces from Central Iraq  and their concentration at Basra  would lead  todisaster and to the complete collapse of the Iraq State.  Only experience will showwhether the High  Commissioner is right or wrong  in insisting upon the necessityfor retaining  a British force in Central Iraq, but, at all events, there is no need toreach  a final decision on this question  at the present stage.  It may be left open forthe  present, and indeed, until the  time comes to  make  active preparation for thewithdrawal of British  forces from their present stations.     13.  It is understood that the  Air Staff would be prepared to accept the high commissioners proposal for setting a limit of five years to our occupation of Mosuland Hinaidi,  and a  draft Article  to give effect to this  proposal, which has beenprepared in consultation with them, is appended to this Memorandum (Appendix C).It is recommended that the High Commissioner should be instructed to endeavour toobtain the Iraq Governments acceptance of an Article on those lines.
    14.   To sum up, it is recommended that the High Commissioner should be given authority to negotiate with the Iraq Government on the following basis :     (1)  The duration of the Treaty to be for a period of twenty-five years and a          provision to be included in the Treaty on the lines of the draft Article in          Appendix B;    (2)  All mention of liability for the cost of providing alternative accommodation          for the RAJ. to be omitted from the Treaty,  but an exchange of notes          to be concluded and appended to the Treaty, placing it on record that all          outstanding financial questions, including those which it is necessary to          settle for the purposes of the operation  of the Treaty and the Military          Appendix, will form the subject of a separate  agreement which shall be          deemed to be an integral part of the Treaty and shall be ratified at the          same time;    (3)  The Iraq Government to grant to His Majesty&apos;s Government, at a nominal          rental,  a lease, for  the  duration  of  the Treaty, of sites for land  and          seaplane bases at Basra;    (4)  British forces to be withdrawn from Mosul  and Hinaidi within a maximum          period  of five  years after the  entry into force of the Treaty, and the          Treaty to include  a provision on  the  lines  of  the  draft Article in          Appendix C.Middle East Department,    Colonial Office, June 14, 1930.
APPENDIX  A.    AT  any time after the  expiration of a period of twenty-five years from thecoming into force of this Treaty, the High Contracting Parties will, at the requestof either of them, enter into negotiations with a view to such revision of its terms byagreement as may be appropriate in the circumstances as they then exist.  In case of disagreement  the  difference  will  be submitted to the Council of the  League ofNations.APPENDIX  B.     THE present Treaty  shall remain in force for a period of twenty-five years from the date of its coming into force.  At any time after twenty years  from thedate of the coming into force of this Treaty, the High Contracting Parties will, atthe request of either of them,  conclude a new Treaty which shall provide for thecontinued maintenance  and  protection  in  all  circumstances  of  His BritannicMajesty&apos;s  essential  communications,  which  both  High  Contracting   Partiesrecognise to be in their common interest.  In case of disagreement in this matter, thedifference will be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations.APPENDIX  C.    THE strength of the forces maintained in Iraq by His Britannic Majesty inaccordance with the terms of Article      of this Treaty shall be determined  byHis Britannic Majesty from time to time after consultation with His Majesty theKing of Iraq.    His  Britannic Majesty shall maintain forces at Hinaidi  for  a  period of fiveyears  after the entry into force of the Treaty in order to enable His Majesty theKing of Iraq to organise the necessary forces to replace them.  By the expiration ofthat period the said forces of His Britannic Majesty shall have  been withdrawnfrom Hinaidi.  It  shall also be open to His Britannic Majesty to maintain forces atMosul for a maximum period of  five years from the entry into force  of the Treaty.Thereafter, the forces of His Britannic Majesty shall be stationed wholly at or inthe vicinity of Basra, or,  if His Britannic Majesty so desires, shall be  divided between  that locality and  some  other  locality in  Central  Iraq  West of  theEuphrates.o
