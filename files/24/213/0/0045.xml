Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour.1*   I have already circulated to the Cabinet (CP.235(30) )  amemorandum giving: figures and facts with regard to transitional benefit,   The Cabinet asked also that information should begiven with regard to the benefits paid to married women(CP,35(30) Conclusion 4).    For this purpose a specialenquiry has been made at all Exchanges throughout the country,and a detailed analysis setting out the results are appended.2.   Married women who have paid thirty contributions in thelast two years are in general able to establish a claim to unemployment benefit during unemployment.   In considering whether a married woman claimant is available for work orwhether any particular employment is suitable for her, account is taken of family ties, such as children or other family responsibilities.   The woman need not be available for full-time work if she has been In the habit of working only part-time.   In the case of a married woman whose husband is at work or who has young children, employment which would necessitatehei leaving home or removing to another district is regardedas unsuitable,,3.   Married women who have not paid thirty contributions inthe last two years but have paid 8 contributions in last twoyears or 30 at any time may qualify for benefit if they satisfy the transitional condition that they are normally in insurableemployment and will normally seek to obtain their livelihood byinsurable employment.   Large numbers of married women who had had no&apos;insurable employment for considerable periods of time,3 E  ORB  T.CP.240(30)
and had not maintained registration at the Employment Exchange,claimed benefit when the Unemployment Insurance Act,193 0,cameirio operation, and a proportion have been disallowedunder the transitional conditions.   The Umpire has ruledthat benefit should not he disallowed under the transitionalconditions merely because the claimantrs efforts to find employment were not as well directed or as energetic as theymight have been;  on the other hand, he has said thatParliaments did not intend to allow benefit to persons whoprefer to live upon poor law Relief, Unemployment Benefit,or any other source of income not derived from wages earned in insurable employment.,   The Umpire has also pointed outthat many women marry in the expectation that they will he maintained by their husbands and will be free to devote them-selves to domestic duties, and accordingly where a woman has for several months after marriage talc en no steps to obtaininsurable employment it may be presumed that she has abandonedinsurable employment.   Such a presumption may be rebutted byparticular circumstances, such as ill-health of the clairnant.4.   While in some industries, e.g. cotton, married women are commonly-employed after marriage,  in most industries thisis &quot;unusual,  and in many cases it is difficult or - impossiblefor married women to obtain employment in ordinary industrial occupations.   Further there is some tendency at present inthose Industries where women ere largely employed for employers when reducing staff to discharge married womenfirst.   The fact that a claimant is not likely to obtain further industrial employment is, however, not a diseualifica-tion for tho receipt of unemployment benefit.
5.   Numbers Insured.    At July 1929 there were about,760,000 women aged 18 to 64 Insured under the UnemploymentInsurance Acts in Great Britain, as compared with 7,922,000men, 583,000 boys and 435,000 girls.  The number of marriedwomen included in this total is not available.     The principal industries in &quot;which insured women areemployed are shown in the table in Appendix I.  Nearly halfthe total are in the textile and distributive trades.6.    Unemployment - Men apAWomen.   The percentage of recordedunemployment among men and women respectively at the end ofJune in each of the last four years was as follows     Dat^e.               Men.

Between 21st October1929 and 30th June, 1930, the number 9f women on the register**f Employment Exchanges increased hj 108.4- per cent from214,444 t* .447,034, while the number of men increased by45 per cent frwi 935,921 t* 1,358,001.
7*   Unemployed Women.    0?he General increase In unemploy-ment among: women and the higher percentage increase ascompared with men are due largely to the recent trade depression which has particular^ affected those industries in which women are employed to a considerable extent, e.g.textile tx\a.des and pottery.   A detailed analysis for otherindustries is given in Appendix II.   It is not possible to separate that part of the increase due to the new conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit introduoea by the1930 Act.   It is probable, however, that the effect of theAot is reflected mainly in the increase in the number ofpersons in receipt of transitional benefit.8.   Married Uoaen Claimants.

This disparity is, of course,due to the large number of women temporarily stopped in the cottonindustry.11.   Ordinary Benefit and Transitional Benefit.

3Sie lowar percentages or--jtas-uxal.ti.onal benefit in the SouthernDivisions are no ioubt due in part to the better opportunities for employment in that area but it is probable that the higherproportions in other Divisions are due in part at least to thespecial oiTecft of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1930&quot; in areasof heavy unemployment among women.13.

14.   Industrial analysis.    Among the various industries thecotton industry furnishes the greatest number sf married i?cmenclaimants.  38.3 per cent of the total are from that industryand ef this number nearly half are from the weaving section,7.4 per cent were in the woollen and worsted industry, 6.1per cent in the metal industries, 2,1 per cent in the engineering,and motor vehicle trades, and 5.3 per- cent in the distributive trades.     The proportions pf the total number of married womenclaimants, who are en Transitional Benefit vary with different industries.   The percentages are lewe&quot;St in industries whichhave had a low rate of unemployment, such as the printing and paper trades,  and the clething, boot and shoe and food, drinkand tobacco industries.   In these industries from 14 to 17rjer cent pf the married women were an Transitienal Benefit.   Theprppertion is highest in the textile industries, (e.g. Jute 24per cent, Cotton 18.3 per cent), the metal trades 20 per cent.and hotel and boarding house service 22.8 per cent.  Althoughhotel and boarding house service is a seasonal trade the comparatively high figure for this group is surprising.  It isto be nsted, however, that this is accounted for by the figuresfor the Northern part of the ceuntry, the figure fpr the Southof England being about 10 per cent.15.   Benefit drawn in previous 12 menths.  Direct statistics ofthe amount of unemployment experienced by married women claimantsare n*t available.  Figures are available for the amount ofunemployment benefit drawn, but in the case of married tfomenwho have been enabled to receive benefit by reason of theUnemployment Insurance Act 1930, the recerd of benefit covers aperiod of rather less than four months, and this tends therefore to understate the amount of unemployment experienced for theyear as a wlur-le,,                &apos;:  -           8.
     The average amount of benefit drawn during the -previousIE months by all married women unemployed at 7th July, 1930,was 104 days.   In the case of those on Transitional benefit the average was 144 days and for those on Ordinary Benefitit was 96 days.   The average of 104 days compares with84.5 days for all women claimants at 16th September, 1929,but no corresponding figure is available for married womenonly at that date.   It is probable, having regard to theincrease in unemployment during the last 10 months that anaverage figure for all women claimants both married andsingle at the present time would show an increase over thatobtained in September last.     As might be expected, the average amount of benefitdrawn varies between different industries and different age groups.   Married women aged 55-64 drew on the average 122days in the year while those aged 18-24 drew an average of102 days.     In the Jute Industry the average over all ages taken together was 131 days as compared with 106 daj^s in thecotton industry and 79 in the engineering and motor industry.     About 75 per cent of the married women were on benefit for not more than half the maximum period while 25 per centwere on benefit for more than half the period.    1.7 per centwere on benefit for the whole year.
