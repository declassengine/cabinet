THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1930.SECRET.                                                    COPY NO.   29CP. 205 (30).                                 CABINET.                             NEW HEBRIDES.           Memorandttm by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.     IN his memorandum of the 9th January, 1930 (CP. 11 (30)),. the Secretary of State for the Colonies raises the question  of British policy in regard to the New Hebrides.  The solution which he proposes for a situation, in which the decreasingly important British interests  involved are being slowly but surely  squeezed out by our French colleagues in the Condominium,  is to spend more money there in the hope of  strengthening our means of resistance.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer,  on  the other hand, in his  memorandum of the 30th May (CP. 186 (30)), states that  he would prefer to withdraw from our share of the Condominium after bringing the matter  up at the Imperial Conference where we would, in the first place, offer Australia or New Zealand the opportunity of  taking over our burden.     From the Foreign Office point of view there is, I think, more to be said for the Treasury than for the Colonial Office proposal, and I submit for the consideration of.my colleagues a memorandum embodying my reasons for this view.                                                                      A.  H.     Foreign  Office, June 13, 1930.    Memorandum on Anglo-French Relations in the New Hebrides under the                                Condominium.   THE British and French Governments agreed in 1906 to establish a Condominiumin the New Hebrides because neither Government was prepared to hand over to thecontrol  of the  other those traders and settlers who had  established  commercial interests in  the group  or  those  missionaries  who  had claims on  its protection.Moreover, neither  Government was  prepared  to  abandon  the islands  to  a  thirdPower,  and  both were  in agreement as to the need for adopting some method of settling the claims arising from the ownership of native lands, and for establishingsome jurisdiction over the natives which would put  an end to inter-tribal quarrelsand improve the condition of the  inhabitants of the islands.      5430  [21226]
    The Condominium left the Resident Commissioner of each Power with juris-diction over his own fellow-countrymen,  but established a  Joint  Court  for  thesettlement of all cases regarding offences committed by natives and, in particular, allca,ses  regarding ownership of  land, and placed various public services under  thejoint  control of the  two Resident Commissioners.  The system thus  set  up  wasrevised and amplified in 1914  and sections of the Protocol then signed have been more than once revised since that date.    From the outset it was apparent that the Condominium would never be an easysystem to administer.  The main difficulty sprang from the absence  of all  indepen-dent local authority on which a system of administration could be based and fromthe impossibility of merging into one two systems of law so different as the english and the French. However loyally, therefore, the two Resident Commissioners carriedout the terms of the Condominium, friction would have been inevitable. In actualpractice, however, this loyalty has not always been found on the side of the French.The French accepted the Condominium at  the outset only because they were unableto obtain full  possession of the  islands,  and whereas  the policy  of  the british resident has been logically to develop the principle of Joint Administration in  thehope that out of it or under it some local system of self-government might eventuallymaterialise, the object of the French Residency has frankly been the furtherance ofFrench interests and the encouragement of French influence throughout the islands.French colonial policy has, in the past, differed greatly from British  colonial policy,and any suggestions  made by  the British Government for the abolition of nativerecruiting, for  the prohibition of the sale of shot guns.  &amp;c, have met with steadyopposition from the French.    This clash of  principle and of policy has  inevitably resulted in perpetualdisputes between the  two Governments, while the need for obtaining the agreementof both the Governments in the numerous questions which come up for revision and settlement  in the course of administration leads  to incessant correspondence  andmost unfortunate delays.  In fact, it is not too much to say that the  administrationof the New Hebrides offers a problem which acts as a constant irritant  in the  relationsbetween His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government.    The importance attached to the islands by His Majesty&apos;s Government is perhaps not such as would admit of this irritation developing into serious dispute,  and  theharm arising to Franco-British relations out of the Condominium is  in itself hardlysufficient to justify our withdrawal from the Group. But owing to the refusal of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to allow British planters to introduce native  labour into  the islands from overseas,  and  to  other  reasons, British holdings  and interests havesteadily  declined, and if  things go on  in  the same way British interests willapparently be eventually squeezed out.   The Colonial  Office feel that  this state ofthings must not be allowed to  last, and that  we should  either withdraw from  theGroup or try to improve our position.  The first alternative they consider unaccept-able, in  VIEAV of the deplorable  loss  of  prestige it would involve.  But  it is  forconsideration whether  prompt  withdrawal, such as  is  clearly indicated by  theeconomic and political facts of the case, would not be much less prejudicial to our prestige than a policy of waiting until we are pushed out of the Group.  The second alternative unless the Colonial Office can show more clearly than they do at presentthat their proposals are really going to improve our position and make it possible  forour settlers and traders to thrive looks like throwing good money after bad.    In these circumstances it would appear desirable, from the Foreign Office pointof view,  to put an end to the  Condominium  system without further delay.  Thereare four possible alternatives worthy of consideration :     (1) The  withdrawal of France from  the  Group.  In view of the considerableFrench interests in the Group  and of ITS trading  connexions with New  Caledonia,this solution would certainly not be acceptable to the French.    (2) Partition of  the islands between the &quot;United Kingdom and France.  TheFrench Government rejected the proposals His Majesty&apos;s Government made  forpartition in  1926, for they see that  the British holdings are falling into Frenchhands, and they are  not disposed to  acquire by partition or  exchange that whichcan be obtained, in substance at least, by merely waiting.    (3) Assumption by the Commonwealth or New Zealand Government of responsi-bility for British interests in the Group.   This, as the Treasury suggest, would bethe best solution, as Australia is the part of the Empire most interested in the Group.
But in 1927 the Commonwealth Government said that they feared that their assump-tion of responsibility would help matters little if His Majesty&apos;s Government still held to their refusal to  allow the introduction into the Group of native labour from outside.  It seems probable, therefore, that the Dominions will decline, and we shallhave to fall back on     (4) Withdrawal from the Group.  France would be unlikely to consent to give us compensation, any more than she would consent to partition.  We must, however,seek guarantees of decent treatment for  the natives ,and of fair opportunity forBritish settlers,  traders  and  missionary enterprise.   This  could  doubtless  beobtained by Treaty, but the enforcement of the Treaty provisions would  in.  all probability involve us in as much bickering with the French as the Condominium.  Itis therefore worthy of consideration whether the French  might not be prepared, inreturn  for our evacuation of the Group, to consent to  take  a Mandate over  the islands.  France would lose nothing; she would retain control of her nationals andwould  be freed from the  tiresome presence of a British co-administrator in nativequestions.   At  the same time, provisions could be made in the Mandate for thenon-fortification of the Group,  for the protection of the natives, for the equal treat-ment of British settlers,  traders and missionaries, such  as France would hesitate,in face of public opinion at Geneva, to infringe.Foreign Office, June 1930.
