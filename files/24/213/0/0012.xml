Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Home,Affairs.         In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet (Cabinet 32 (3O) Conclusion 7 ), I invited the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Org&amp;n- isations to confer with me on the question of the publication of the &apos; Report of the Committee on the Cotton Industry, and this afternoon I discussed the question with &amp; deputation representing- that body.         I circulate herewith for the information of the Cabinet a Inote of this afternoon&apos;s discussion, from which It will be observed that the Joint Committee concur in the publication of the Report pro-                                                      to  the  tradeIpifJed that arrangements are made for the Keport to be communicated/ifllljust before publication..                They suggested that this  ight be done at a specially convened meeting of the Joint Committee  t which a member of the Cabinet should be present to state the viewsIff the Government.   They further suggested that, in order to meet  he susceptibilities of some of their constituent organisations, it  ould be desirable for communications to be addressed on behalf of the  overnment to each of those bodies explaining the action proposed to  e taken and expressing the Government&apos;s hope that their reprecenta-  ives would be able to be present at the proposed meeting.         The course of action proposed to be taken appears to me to    reasonable and I recommend that the Cabinet should approve it.                             (Intd.)  J. R.

49Notes of a Meeting held at the Home Office,3.W.I., on Friday, June 20th, 1930, at 3 p.m.The Right Hon. J. R. Clynes, M.P.,Secretary of State for Home Affairs(In the  Chair.). H.  J.  Wilson,  ICCB.,  C.B.E.,retary,  Lord Privy Seal1asrtment. A.  P.  Hemming, C.B.E., stant  Secretary, omic Advisory  Council.Mr. H. Tir.

Secretary, Joint Committeeof Cotton Trade Organisations.Mr. Hi. G. Hughes, ExecutiveSecretary, Joint Committee ofCotton Trade Organisations.      MR. CLYMLS informed the Deputation that the Report ofthe Committee on the Cotton Industry had been submitted to theCabinet, by whom the question of publication was under con-sideration.   In general, his feeling and that  of his colleagueswas in farour of the Report being published.    He had reasonto believe that this view was shared by the operatives.  Hisobject in summoning the present meeting was to  ascertain theviews of the Joint Committee, which he regarded as generallyrepresentative of all sections of the industry.      As regards the Report of the Committee on the CottonIndustry, he did not believe that there was anything in it which dould in any way prejudice the prospects  either of theindustry or of any part of it.  He was not, however, In aposition to do more than indicate generally that the Reportfell into four sections.  The first was historical, thesecond reviewed and commented on the more important portions                                                       of
50of the evidence received, e.g*, questions relating -to techni-cal re-equipment, etc., the third contained the conclusions.and the fourth the recommendations,.  In the discussion in theReport of the evidence received care had been taken to avoid any reference to the views of individual witnesses.      SIR ERNEST THOMPSON said that the Home Secretary&apos;sletter bad been received the previous day in time to be con-sidered at a meeting of the Joint Committee that had been called for that day-   The representatives of the Spinnerson the Joint Committee were of the opinion that the report should not be published until they were satisfied that it contained nothing prejudicial to the interests of the trade.They held that they were justified in this view by promiseswhich they stated had been given to them (a) in the informal discussions with the president of the Board of Trade beforethe Committee of Inquiry was appointed and (b) in the more recent discussions in Manchester at which Mr. J. H* Thomashad been presento   They did not suggest that any undertaking of this kind had been given to them on behalf of theCommittee of Inquiry itself.   The representatives of theWeavers had not been present at the meeting on the previous day, but it was probable that they shared the views of the spinners.      MR. 155;  said that the general expectation of the tradewas that the Report would not be published except to thetrade.   He did not, however, think, that they would objectif they approved the substance of the Report.  It was important to obtain their concurrence In ordez* to avoid creating a feeling of antagonism, as any such feeling wouldprejudioe the action to,he taken on the Report.     SIR HORACE WILSON said that it was for this reason that,when in Manchester, Mr. J. H. Thomas had informed the Joint                                                 Committee
51Committee that he hoped that, when the Report was receivedhy the Government, it would he possible for a cabinet minister to discuss it with the Joint Committee with aview to framing proposals for action to be taken.     In reply to a question by the Secretary of State, SIRERNEST THOMPSON said that the Joint Committee hoped thatit would be possible for  them to receivethe Report and treat its conclusions and recommendations as part of their work-   He believed the most helpfulcourse would be for the Government to communicate officiallywith Mr. Lee, as Chairman of the Joint Committee, informing him that the Report was received end that the Governmentdesired to present it to the trade; that they would there-fore be obliged if he would be good enough to call a meetingof the Joint Committee for the purpose of receiving it,this special meeting to be attended by a Cabinet Minister,who would then make a general statement of the government&apos;s policy.   He hoped that it would be possible for the Govern-ment to arrange for the Report to be placed in the handsof the Joint Committee for their confidential information,say, half an hour before the time fixed for the meeting.Prior consultation of this kind would, he believed, smoothaway any doubts in the minds of the trade in regard to publication.   The Report itself could then be publishedeither that afternoon or the following day.     MR. LEE agreed with the course suggested by Sir ErnestThompson, but suggested that, in addition, at the same time that the Government issue their invitation to the JointComnittee, the Government should write to the organlsationsxof the various sections of the trade, informing them thatthey were anxious to consult it on the action to be taken                                                     on                     - 3 -(x For Organisations, see Annex.)
on the Report and that to this end they had invited theJoint Committee to summon a special meeting at which amember of the Government would be present.   The soonersuch a mesting could be held the better; any day on or after July 1st would be convenient.      MR. C DYKES thanked the Deputation and undertook toreport their views to his colleagues.2, Whitehall Gardens, S-.W.1.    June 20th * 1930.
