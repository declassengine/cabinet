\   (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANM^G,MAJESTY1S    georet.                                              &quot;   &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;CP.230(30)                                             Copy No.                            CABINET.India; the G-overrior General1s Address   to the Legislature on 9th  July.The Round Table Conference and its              authority.         The accompanying telegrams are circulated tothe Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Telegram from Viceroy,  dated 3rd July,  1930.Immedi ate.    581-S.  Private and personal.    Your telegrams  2111,2112 and 2113 of July 1st,         I fully recognise the difficulty of  the  situationand am very grateful to you and the Cabinet for your  support.Reading&apos;s amendment might have been possible  but  it is clear from what you say of the Conservative attitude that avoidance of Party controversy would not be  thereby ensured.Conservative attitude as expressed  by Chamberlain  isdeplorable evidence of gulf existing between  progressiveBritish opinion here and that for  which he speaks.   2.     I am quite sure,  however, that nothing  would atthis stage be more disastrous for  us than an  acrimoniousdebate in Parliament in which new  fuel would  be added tothe flames and no doubt many would be likely  to takeChamberlain&apos;s line about the infallibility of Simon&apos;s Report.This would, just now, greatly aggravate difficulties.   3.     I therefore think we must abandon the idea  of immediate:.&apos;- Statement in Parliament and from this^r,ound I have considered the two alternative suggestions made in  yourtelegram 2113.  The objection to the first is that  it is nowevident that only very jejune statement would escapeParliamentary criticism with ill results mentioned  inparagraph 2 and, to the second, that it would involve greatdelay.    4.    Best course, therefore,  in my judgment, would beto give up idea of Statement in Parliament and for  me inspeech next Wednesday, which would furnish better settingthan formal Statement, to refer to following  three  points -                                                     (a)
     (a)  that Statement  of  Last November about Dominion                 Status  stands;     (b)  that the Conference will be unfettered by Simon                 Report;  and     (c)  that any agreement reached at the Conference will                  be  the basis of your proposals to                  Parliament.    5.    I will telegraph  tomorrow test of the moreimportant passages of the spee ch, including the specialpoints referred to in 4  above.  I hope you will think thatI have stated these in language as little provocative toLiberal and Conservative opinion as possible.    6.    I would suggest that, if you agree, you shouldtell Party Leaders that  in  deference to their views your government would refrain from making the statement suggested,but expected in return that they would refrain from criticism of the plain assertion by me  of thethree points sot outin 4 above.    7.    These I regard as irreducible minimum.   We arealready pledged to the first  two,  and the third wouldseem to be exclusively the  affair  of your Government.I would therefore suggest,  if  you  approve generally of myincorporating them.in my speech, we  should  in any case stickto saying so much.
     586-S.   Private and personal.   Following is outline ofthe political part of my address.   I propose to make to bothHouses of the Legislature at 2.30 on Wednesday 9th JisLy    2.    I sketch the recent growth of political andnationalist thought in India, particularly since the reformsof 1919, and say that one of the Viceroy&apos;s principal dutiesis to work for progressive, orderly and contented India withinBritish Commonwealth.   I refer to the difficulties whichpresented themselves when I came to India  &quot;It was alsoevident that looking ahead it was hardly to be expected that india, rightly sensitive of her self-respect, and, growingevery year more conscious .of national feeling, should,  of her own free will, indefinitely desire to remain a partner inthe political society of the British Empire except upon termsof equality of partnership.   It was for this reason, and withthe object of removing avoidable misunderstanding on this vital matter, that His Majesty&apos;s Government last yearauthorisod me to declare, in unmistakable terms, that in their view nothing less than such equality of status with the otherdominions was the natural completion of India&apos;s constitutionalgrowth&quot;.    3.    I then refer to the Conference and the Simon Report  -&quot;That Report has now been published and in spite of criticism which it has evoked and whatever may be.opinion held upon theactual conclusions reached, I do not think any impartial readerwould deny that the Commission have made a thoughtful and constructive contribution to a very difficult problem&quot;.&quot;And therefore swooping denunication of the Commission&apos;sReport will not greatly help us at the present juncture.   What                                                   is
is required from those who criticise or reject the proposalsof the Commission is reasoned and detailed argument insupport of another and a better plan.         The responsibility for expressing a considered opinion now passes to the Government of India, and just  asthe Commission would have failed in their duty to  Parliament,by whom they were appointed,  if they had no  presented areport that reflected faithfully their own conclusions as members of the British Parliament,  so the Government of  india would fail in its duty to the people of India if theysimilarly did not approach consideration of the CommissionsReport with complete liberty of judgment.   le have not hitherto been able to do more than give preliminary andtentative examination to the report, and before reaching (conclusions I think it is right that I should have theopportunity of discussing  the whole subject with sane ofthose who can speak for  non-official Indian opinion.   i hope to have occasion to do this with some of the  RulingPrinces and representatives of the States next week, andI should propose also to invite British Indian leadersrepresentative of different views to meet me for  this purpose as may be found in (sic) convenient&quot;.    4.    I condemn Civil Disobedience movement and explained the reasons which have- impelled me to employ special powers.I commend the work of Government servants in recent trouble,sympathise with innocent sufferers, but lay blame  onorganisers of Civil Disobedience.   &quot;The gravity  of presentmovement, however, does not deflect my judgment on thequestion, of constitutional reform by a hair&apos; s-breadth to theright or left.   Honourable  Members know that I  am notfighting Civil Disobedience because I lack sympathy for                                                natural
 natural Nationalist  feelings  of  India.   I have never concealed my  desire  to  see  India in  enjoyment of as large a degree of management of her own  affairs as could be shown to be compatible with necessity  of  making provision for those matters in regard  to which  India was not yet ready to assume full responsibility.   I am,  therefore, bound, at this time, to keep two principal objectives in forefront of my mind, and I desire, in this regard, to state my position and that of my Government in  the clearest terms.   So long as Civil Disobedience movement persists we are bound to fight it with all our  strength&quot;.     5.     A passage  then follows regarding the possibility of conciliation, see my private  and personal telegram 577-S, 30th June.  I am still in consultation with the Governors regarding  its exact  text, and will telegraph further to you on  this subject.     6.     I then proceed.   &quot;The  date of the assembly of the Conference has already been made public,  and,  on behalf of  His Majesty&apos;s Government, I am now able to define its functions more precisely.   After very careful consideration, His Majesty&apos;s Government have reached the conclusion that itwould not be right to prescribe for the Conference any termsmore limited than were implied in my statement of  November 1st  last, and that Conference should enjoy full  freedomthat those words connote.    The Conference accordingly willbe  free  to pursue its task greatly assisted indeed but with liberty unimpaired by report of Statutory Commission or byany  other documents which will be before it.,    It is  the belief of His Majesty&apos;s  Government that by way of  conference it  should be possible to reach solutions that  both countries and all parties  and interests in them can honourably accept                                           and
and any such agreement at which Conference  is  able to arrivewill form basis of proposals which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill later submit to Parliament.          From such a definition of  the  scope  of the Conference,it is clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s conception  of itis not that of a mere meeting for discussion and debate, but rather that of a Joint Assembly of representatives of both countries, on whose agreement the precise proposals toParliament should be founded.   The Conference will thus enjoyunfettered right of examining the whole  problem in all  itsbearings, with the knowledge that its labours  are of noacademic kind;  and I should certainly hope that from frankdiscussion on all sides a scheme might emerge  for submission to Parliament which would confound pessimism of thosewho would tell us that it is impossible  for Great Britain  andIndia to reachiagreement.   Those discussions will representa genuine attempt to reach agreement on  these  difficultmatters amongst those who will speak respectively  for GreatBritain and for India, and His Majesty&apos;s Government gree/t ]yhope that those in India who have hitherto felt unwilling  totake part in this constructive work will be prepared to reconsider their decision&quot;.    7.,   I conclude by regretting failure in  India to respond adequately to statement of 1st November,  and byappoaling for  far-sightedness and for mutual trust  between india and Britain.
