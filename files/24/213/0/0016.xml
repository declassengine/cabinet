DOCUMENT IS TIT:-; PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENT)RET.16 (3/3).COPY NO.   %CABINETCOORDINATION OF LONDON PASSENGER TRAFFIC.Memo.by the Minister of Transport,       In the course of tho next few weeks I expect toreceive Sir William ivlcLintock1 s report on this matter.If it enables a satisfactory  scheme to be framed.,  it  isimportant that a Bill should be passed next session.       In the first place, tho complexity- of the various interests is suoh that questions may at any moment arise in connexion with the current conduct of their business(such as the placing of important long-term contracts)and with a proposed sale or purchase of subsidiary under.-takings which may bo embarrassing to mo and which  I cannoton the other hand ignore since they may affect the finance and commit the policy of a new traffic authority.   Suchproblems have, indeed, already arisen.       Next, the death, of the General Manager of thoMetropolitan Railway  (Mr. Selbie) is bound to lead the Boardof that Company to review its position.   I take the  viewthat the Metropolitan line must be part and parcel of theLondon system, but hitherto its policy has been to holdaloof from the London Underground greup and ally itself withthe four Amalgamated Companies as a fifth  &quot;main line&quot;.       Spasmodic conversations have, however, taken place inthe past with a view to some  arrangement between tho  Metro-poll tun and tho Underground.   Lord Ashfiold told  mo  (in confidence) last week that they are being revived  and I shallhave at ence to decide whether I am to object or,  alternatively,
,what  it may be necessary to  do  to protect the new Authority.    Clearly  I  am  in a  not too  strong position if  I  object without being  able  to say with  authority that  it is tho intention of  the  Government  to secure the passage of a  Bill next  Session.        Thirdly, I have reason  to think that the Main Lines may wish to come  to  some  provisional  agreement with  the Underground  and seek an expression of  my views, for here again the interests of the new authority are vitally affected.        Lastly, new motor  coach services, not sub sect to  any control, are establishing themselves in  the  London area with a view to staking  out claims  for  the  future. When  tho Road Traffic Bill is passed  I  shall obtain some control, but  it will  be difficult to  protect a  prospective Traffic Authority unless its establishment  is imminent.        My position would  be far less difficult if  I were  able to  say that the  Government  intend to  legislate on  the basis  of my statement of December last which adum- bratod the formation  of a  public Traffic Authority  for London and which indicated early action.        Apart from the  practical points to  which I  have referred, I would impress  on my colleagues  the  great  im- portance which  the Labour  Party, in London  at  any rate, attaches to establishing complete public control  of London passenger traffic before we  leave office.   Such a  step is  fully in conformity  with the fundamental principles for which we  stand.   Some settlement of the problem is by  common consent long  overdue. &quot; The problem should be settled  on our  lines  and not loft exposed to the  risk that in  a  more favourable  atmosphere the  old Co-ordination Bills will be revived and, next time, passed into law.         There  is good  reason to anticipate a definite Parliamentary majority  for the  Bill.    The  Liberal  &quot;Yellow Book&quot; postulates substantially  the  same policy  proposed
&quot;by our &quot;own Cabinet Committee, C.P.305(29)A which theCabinet approved on 14th November, 1929, and &quot;We canConquer Unemployment&quot; featured London Traffic develop-ment as part of tho Liberal unemployment policy.  Eventhe Conservative Party would have to think before ob-structing in view of  (a) the admitted urgency of thematter, and (b) tho fact that ours is tho only lastingand practicable solution in existing Parliamentarycircumstances.       To cum up -       (I) Urgent matters of policy affecting our           intentions have arisen and will continue-           to arise in the existing undertakings.       (2) Having rejected the Co-ordination Bills,           and In view of the admitted urgency of           the mattor, our position will be poli-           tically indefensible if delay occurs.       (3) A socialistic Bill of this oharacter would           be popular with the Labour Party, ?/ould           be in accordance with declared Liberal           policy, and would drive tho Conservatives           to partial acquiescence or profitless           oppos ition.      I ask, therefore, for an assurance that timo willbe found for legislation on this question next session.                             (Intd.) H.M.Ministry of Transport,23rd June,  1930.
