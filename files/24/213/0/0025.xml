THE STATE OF TRADE AS REPORTED AT31OR TO THE MEETING OF THE BOARD OF TRADEADVISORY C council ILHeld on            Wednesday, June 18th, 1930oMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     It. need hardly be said that the general tone of the reportswas one of depression only slightly relieved by a feeling,thatthe natural reaction must inevitably follow;  few signs of any immediate improvement were visible.     The Banking representatives were inclined to regard thecontinued and heavy fall In the price of silver, now down to16d, per oz. (or less than a quarter of the price shortly afterthe War), as one of the most important elements in the presentdepression (though it was suggested that this fall might bepartly an effect rather than a cause).   They saw no sign ofimprovement at present;  a further fall in the price of wheat,surplus stocks of almost every raw material which were carriednecessarily at a certain cost, the new United States tariff andthe renewed slump on Wall Street were all adverse elements inthe situation.     As regards wheat, reference was made by other members tothe important efforts made by the United States Farm Board (andthe United States Treasury behind it) and the Canadian Pool to save wheat prices from falling when the new crops begin to move in July and later.   It was impossible to say whether these efforts would be successful;  it seemed that increasing supplies from Australia, India and Russia would have to be reckoned with,he UMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITAIN PC majesty^S GOVERNMENT.
    Coal production in May showed a slight decline  of about  2%while unemployment in that trade increased to 22.1% as comparedwith 16,6$ at the end of April.    Exports fell off  in April  ascompared with March (but April included Easter) and the exportsfor May recovered to just over 5,000,000 tons,,   The outlook for the immediate future is not  reassuring as there is keencompetition from Continental countries, especially  Poland whichis selling at ll/6d to 12/- per  ton (presumably fto,bf),     Particular reference was made to the failure of british coal exporters to secure more than 2,000 tons of the contracts for 186,000 tons recently placed by the Swedish State Railways0These are usually obtained for English and Scottish coals and serious concern is felt at their loss, especially in the caseof 8,000 tons of bunker coals which has gone to Westphalia at ahigher figure than the Durham tender;  this matter  is beinginquired into0    Inland trade is very quiet owing to the greatslackness in industry generally.     The decline  in the production of iron and steel continued,during May and the number of blast furnaces at the  end of themonth was only 141 or loss than at any time since February,1929,   The prospects for the future are not encouraging as themain iron and steel consuming industries are short of work, theonly bright feature being the decision to build the new Cunardvessel on the Clyde.   The tube  trade is particularly bad,several mills in  Scotland and south Wales being at a standstill.     The depressed state of the  industry is common to all ironand steel producing countries.   Special reference  is made tothe steps which Germany is taking to improve the positionthrough a reduction in wages and salaries equivalent to 7-1%,conditional upon the adjustment  of iron and steel prices soas to more than compensate for and to precede the cuts in wages.   The revised prices apply only to the German home market and it is  improbable that the German makers  will makeM2h
any reduction in their export prices so that the  consequence  ofthe reductions to Great Britain will not be what  the Press herehas suggested on the erroneous supposition that the price reductions would apply also to exported goods.     The tin plate trade has been comparatively well employed,but the galvanised sheet trade remains badly depressed.    Theseconditions are reflected in the non-ferrous metal markets  wheretin (and lead and copper wire) are fair, but zinc poor.     The motor industry shows marked depression.    Even thecommercial vehicle output which has been a satisfactory featureuntil recently is beginning to suffer.   Financial conditions inall bre.nch.es of the trade give rise to anxiety.   The exporttrade, to which great importance is attached, is below 1929 butthe decline is not so serious as might have been anticipatedfrom the extent of the world-wide trade depression.     In shipbuilding notwithstanding the provisionalarrangement of one very large contract  (the new Cunarder)  and in engineering generally orders are not coming forward at anything like the rate at which the existing work is being  completed.     Shipping freights have now reached the lowest  level since1920;  this is attributed, in the main, to the absence of anygeneral demand for cereals in this country and in Europe.     For cotton it is reported that during May production musthave reached the lowest level ever recorded.   The  unemploymentproportion is now  (end of May) 39$, an  increase of  9% during themonth.   This is of course largely due to  the almost completedisappearance of orders from  India and to  the crisis in Chinadue chiefly to the continued fall in the price of  silver.    Thehome trade on the whole is not so bad as the overseas.   raw cotton prices have fallen.   Some hopeful  features  are referredto by Sir Kenneth  Stewart in the shape  of  the financial crisisexperienced by the Japanese cotton trade which it  is hoped will
help in putting an end to their unsound methods of forcing their export trade.   The opinion is also expressed that the Indianboycott situation will prove only temporary.     The dispute in the woollen industry is virtually at an end,and work is &quot;being resumed at wage reductions which vary from5.8 per owt. to the full amount of 9.249 per cent, recommended.by Lord Macmillan - in a few cases the old rates are being paidwithout any reduction.   The resulting situation is characterisedas chaotic.     Wool prices rose further during May, both in Australia andin Argentina, but business in the trade generally is quiet.     The number of unemployed increased during May by 72,000 to1,770,000, the increase &quot;being mostly (62,000) in personstemporarily stopped and mostly in the cotton and coal industries,the figures for which have already been given.      It was reported by the Co-operative Members that wholesaleand retail prices were now coming more into line in such goodsas sugar, butter and lardj  in the case of  sugar the retaildecline during the past 12 months  (7.69%) exceeded the wholesalofall  (6.2%)j  flour, however, had gone up 5.85% in the retail price against a slight fall (.66%) In the wholesale.Co-operative Trade generally  seemed to be about stationary, butfor Scotland at any rate  shares and deposits by members show a normal  increase.      Retail distributive  trade during May was  on the wholo not so bad  as might have been expected.   Local unemployment is responsible for an increase in the non-payment of hire purchaseinstalments.      In the Argentine the marked fall in the value  (and volume)of exports  during  the first quarter of the  year (due mainly to much  smaller shipments of wheat) has led to a  depreciation of the                              -4-
peso (from 47.58d.  to below 42df),  which  seems to call either for further borrowing abroad or  the freeing  of gold  exports fromthe existing restrictions.    Exchange  difficulties obtain alsoin Brazil and Peru,     The Chilean nitrate  rationalisation  plan is making good progress.                                   w .

CONFIDENTIAL.        Meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council,                  Wednesday, 18th June\ 1950.     MR. G-ILLETT (in the Ohair) :  Gentlemen, I understand wehave been asked to go on as the President has had to go to theHouse of Commons, which, as I expect you know, is still sitting.     We are glad to welcome Mr0 Goodendugh back again;  perhapsyou will make your statement.                            BANKING.     MR. G00DE.N0UGHJ  I might mention a few points in connectionwith the Bank figures, which are rathsr speoially interesting atthis time,  I daresay that Members of the Council will havenoticed that the discounts shown in the May Statement of theLondon Clearing Banks have increased by about  38,000,000 duringtho month, that is to say, they run up from  210,000,000 to 248,000*000;  and On the other side you will see that thedeposits are up  30*000,000, which is not very far apart fromthe  38^000,000 of discounts;  that id to say, the depositshave increased from  1,750,000,000 to  1,780,000*000,  It perhapsrequires a little explanation.  In part this is due; to anincrease tn bills, but in part it is supposed to be due to thefact that foreign Central Banks, especially the Bank of Franco,who have been habitually investing largely in Bills on this side,have apparently come out of Bills and have been placing their.money with the Joint Stock Banks, and that would account for a-.-..rise in deposits.  At the same time disoounts are up, which means that those Bills which were formerly in the hands of the Frenchand other nationalities are now in the hands of the LondonOloaring Banks.  That would account for some part of the changeson the two sides of the balance shoet whioh are rather interest-ing,  I imagine that it is principally the Bank of France thathas large balances in this country, and when the Bill rate wasno longer attractive to them they came out of Bills and placedtheir money on deposit for certain periods with the Banks, that figure hj  discounts of  38,000,000 might, without an explanation of that kind, have been perhaps calculated to mislead and might indicate some special trade movement, but I do not think it is 3&apos;I think it is partly due to the operation whioh I havo mentionedand partly to inoreased issues of Treasury Bills.     Then you will see in the same return that the Bank loanspublished by the London Clearing Banks are continuing to fall.In the return for May they are  972,000,000, whioh compares with  984,000,000 for April and  991,000,000 for March;  and inthe same way the Acceptances in May were  144,000,000, and inApril  159,000,000;  so that there is a doorease there, and both those two items really indicate the general slackness of trade,     Tho Clearing House returns are down when you look at theCountry and Metropolitan figures;  they are slightly up for theTown Clearing, but the increase of Town Clearing does notneoessarily denote any special trading aotivity;   it was probabl-due more to Finanoial operations.
     Then as regards money rates, the tendency all overthe world has been for a reduction of Bank rates.   I willhand in the particulars in detail&apos;&quot;&apos;.     As regards discount rates which have been very low,there has been a sudden rise.  The three-months Bill waschanging hands at      per cent, discount until the last ten days or so, when there has been a steady rise, and itIs now about S-l per cent.  This has been partly due to thecontinued outflow of gold, principally to Prance, but alsoto Germany.  Since the 14th May last, the loss of gold bythe Bank of England on balance has been about  6,000,000.The outflow was larger than that, but it has been partly offset by the arrival of gold from South Africa and australia;  on balance, however, as I have said, the Bankof England has lost about  6,000,000 gold.     Then there is an interesting feature which has been specially alluded to in &quot;The Times&quot; as to the fluctuations in the French Exchange and the appreciation of the Francwhich has lately taken place, and which has been partly due to the action of the Bank of England in selling standardgold instead of fine gold, which puts the lower gold point at a lower figure.     I think that perhaps one of the most importantfeatures at the present time  is  the continued fall  in Silver,which you will have noticed has further declined to under16d. per ounce;  that compares with a figure which  Irecollect shortly after the War, Then Silver was, I think,89-ijrd. per ounce.  You quite realise how that affects the purchasing power of the East  and the trade of the worldgenerally;   it must do so because  the credit structure  ofChina and to some extent of India, - formerly, of course,to a much greater extent, - is based upon Silver, and silver at a high level made a vast difference to their power of purchs.se.  I myself  am  inclined to think thecontinued fall in the price of Silver is one of the mostimportant elements  in the great  depression which is rulingat the present time.  Some of the  political troubles inChina may be due to that, because when people have  lostso enormously  as the Chinese  have  lost, in their standardof value in  a  short period of 10 years they get discontentedand all sorts  of things happen;  that is the position atpresent.  Silver is below 16d; and it must be a very potentfactor in affecting world trade.     As regards international trade  conditions, so  far  as Ican see, there is no sign of  improvement at the presenttime.  There has been a further  fall in the price of wheat in Canada, and I imagine that they still have heavy stocks to realise with the new harvest  coming along.  In a wide range of foodstuffs and raw materials there is a surplusof stocks -  coffee, tea, sugar,  cotton, and various.metals -and in every direction these  stocks are being carried at acertain coot,  and it all tends  to weigh down pricesthroughout the world.tfSee Appendix p.  31.-2-
     Another feature to be mentioned is (as is generally-known) that the United States tariff has just been raised to a record figure, which is not encouraging, and that hasbeen followed by a further heavy slump in the AmericanStock Exchange which has its reaction here no doubt.     LORD BRADBURY: Do you think the slight alteration inthe substitution of standard gold for fine gold is really ofany advantage to the Exchange situation?  The explanationgiven in &quot;The Times&quot; was that it was purely accidentaland there was no element of policy in it at all.  many people seem to think that if the gold point were to bewidened a little it would make the Exchange situationeasier?     MR. G00DE1T0UGH:  I do not imagine that after a short time it will make any difference at all.  I mentioned itmerely as a matter of interest.  For the moment it affectscalculations more than results, I think, but after a briefperiod all that will become normal.  It makes no realdifference.     THE CHAIRMAN:  Do you consider that the transfer ofthe French balances from Bills into money has anyimplication in it?  Is it any indication that they arethinking of getting away from Bills or simply that theyget better rates?     MR. GOODENOUGH:  I think for the moment they are simplygetting better rates.  I had a conversation yesterday witha French financial authority over here, and I understandthat the aim of the BVench Government, is to reduce theirfigures here, but admittedly they are at present verylarge - and not only here but in other countries too,  Ithink that the change which has lately been made was simplyon a question of rate, but my own feeling is that it wouldsuit us much better if they were to follow their oldpractice of keeping their money in the Bill Market ratherthan offering it round on deposit, because then if youoffer it round on deposit it is at large and it may goanywhere, whereas, if it is continually invested in Billsas a policy then we know where it is; it helps to keepthings steady even though It may make the discount ratessomewhat weaker through competition than would otherwise be the case,  On the other hand if they invite offers for money it tends to raise the value of money above theBill rate which is not always satisfactory.COAL.     SIR WALTER RAIHE:  I should like to refer in particular to the Swedish State Railway contract for coals whichhas just been given out for 178,000 tons of steam coals.Except 2,000 tons which has gone to Scotland the remainderhas all gone to Poland, and of 8,000 tons of bunker coalsthe entire quantity has gone to Germany,  According to tradereports which are published monthly by the Polish Government,I noticed last week in the June publication that the pricesof Polish steam from the Dcmbrowa District wore 11s.9d.  andfrom Upper Silesia, 12s. Ed., f.o.b. Gdynia.  Even taking
these prioes, whioh are much below the British prices forcoals comparable with those, the Poles, or whoever made upthese prices, have in addition taken some bedrock freights inorder to secure this contract.  Just let me give you oneillustration, Gothenburg for instance, 24,0 JO&quot; tons; the price is 16s. 3-gd. o.i.f.  If you deduct 11s. 9d. you have 4s.6-gd.left for freight, insurance and the importers&apos; profit.  It isonly just that I should say there will be some slight additionto the price to bring it to the British equivalent, becausethose are worked out 1,000 kilos to the ton in comparison withthe British where we work them out at 1,016.     As regards this 8,000 tons of bunker coal hitherto thestate Railways have taken Townley/Mickley, which is a veryfamous brand&apos; of unscreened bunker coal shipped on the Tyne.I did not quote for those particular coals myself, so I askedone&apos;of the leading exporters in Newcastle;  I told him thatI was coming here and I wanted the information.  I asked himwhat he quoted for those and the price ci.f. Malmo was 18s.7-ld.The Swedish Railways have purchased nut coals from Westphaliaand they paid 21s, 9d. a ton;  that is 3s.l-?rd. per ton morethan the price that was put in for British coal.  I am notcomparing exactly like with, like because nut  coals are screened,and they are small, whereas in unscreened, as you know,particularly some of the South Durham  coals,  there is up to40 per cent, of smalls in it.  However that does not get away from the question of the high quality  of Townley, which isprobably the best bunker coal at any rate in  the North ofEngland, and I think that you would be entitled to ask theSwedish Ambassador informally, if you  like, for an explanationso far as the bunker quantity is concerned.   At any rate I  can assure you that the loss of this entire contract except this2,000 tons has caused great consternation in  the North ofEngland.  It means further serious curtailment of work at the pits;  it means loss of revenue to the railways, and generalhardship to a lot of people who are ^directly  or indirectlyconcerned with that.  I am not talking in any political senseat all, but only hard business facts when I say that withthese low quotations how can we expect to get business;and the situation unfortunately is going to be made worse ifthis seven-hours day is introduced at  the present time.  Iwould like further in this connection  to call attention towhat has just happened in Germany where they  have agreed to areduction of wages causing them to be  able to produce theirpig iron and^steel at cheaper prices and thus cause furthercompetition.&apos;&quot;&apos;     If you would like to have the details^of this Swedishcontract I would  be very glad to give them.     THE CHAIRMAN:  We should be very much obliged.  There  isno representative of the Ministry of Mines here and the Reoorthas not yet come through to the Board  of Trade.     SIR WALTER RAINE:  These are the  official figures given bya private importer.     THE CHAIRMAN:  Do these polish coal owners get an advantage,what is practically a subsidy, in regard to freight charges ontheir Polish Railways?*but cf.  Mr. WalmBley&apos;s report.  Appendix p. 19.see Appendix p. 19.
     SIR WALTER RAINE:  There is no doubt they do,  but  a greatdeal of it ID caused through the depreciation of*the  Zloty,  whiohis real;  if the Exchange were correct much of the  disadvantagewould disappear, but they have in spite of that a certain benefit.I have not seen the figures recently,  but I think it  is something like 4s.Od. a ton for the journey from the mines to Gdynia.   Therelative railway rate in this country, I think, would be over 10s.     THE CHAIRMAN:  The other point that you mentioned  to us wasthat the ohief advantage was due to tho depreciation  of theirExchange?     SIR WALTER RAINE:  There is no doubt the Poles get theadvantage.    I have not looked at it  for a few days, but theZloty is over 40,  Thoir basis is the  same as the old French25,22 or something like that.     THE OHAIRiAAN:  You have not any idea what advantage thatrepresents in the price per ton?     SIR  ALTER RAINE:  I have it worked out at home.  I would bovery glad to send it  -tc you if you would like to have  it.     THE CHAIRMAN:  What I wanted to know was how far the positionas far as the English coal owner was more or less hopeless,  and how far it was due to this weakness in exchange whioh nothingwe could do could possibly alter.  If that Is the very  bigfactor then it seems to me that the English position  is hopeless.     SIR WALTER RAINE:  Even if you deduct the actual freight in english money from the 11s.9d, you get a price of 7s.9d., or i will take the higher price, 8s.3d. for the best Silesian screenedsteam.  The ooal is comparable with that from cur district,Lambton and South Hetton.  The current price of Lambton is 16s,and South Hetton 15.6d.   take 15s,6d.   and the  railwaycarriage is about 2s,, that is I3s.6d. against 8s.3d.     I am taking comparable ooal.   Of course, if you takeSouth Yorkshire, which the Swedes do not like on thexr  railways,the railway carriage there is much higher;  I think it  is some-thing like 6s,Od,   Then you get a price of 9s,Od.  against their 8a.3d., but against that you must bear in mind  that the yorkshire people are getting a subsidy, and when you  add thesubsidy you get more or less the same  prices as the Lambton  andSouth Hetfcon.     THE CHAIRMAN:  Thank you very much;  we will have  that  looked into.                          GENERAL TRADE.     SIR WALTER RAINE;  The rest of the reports which I have had from the various Chambers of Commerce can be summed up in three or four sentences.   One sentence that was very striking was:&quot;Commodity prices have again fallen during the past month,  anduntil traders have some certainty that the fall has reached itsend, they are not likely to extend their commitments&quot;.   Anotherreoort said:  &quot;The outlook is unsatisfactory,  and there is  ageneral laok of enquiry&quot;.  The third report  said &quot;Foundrymenare only purohasing sufficient pig iron for immediate use&quot;.   Themost cheerful report or comment of a particular market,  and eventhat requires some qualifying, was:  &quot;Money remains cheap,  andthis should ultimately prove a stimulus to trade&quot;,  but  the  querywas added &quot;would like to know when&quot;.
G 0-OFJSRAT IVS TRADE.     KR. VARLEY:  The figures of our- trade in drapery, woollengoods and furnishings for i\lay compared with those of 3 months ago and 12 months ago all show an increase, even though thereis such bad trade in Lancashire and Yorkshire at the presenttime,   I cannot account for It at the moment, but those are thefiguresi   Also the figures for domestic coal show an increaseof 55 per cent, compared with a year ago and an increase of8.7 per cent, compared with 3 months ago;  that is the weeks ending May 24th compared with the 4 weeks endingFebruary 22nd show an increase of over 0 per cent, in domesticcoal,     On the prices generally, the wholesale and retail prices are coming more into line with each other.   Our figures hereshow that sugar has gone down on the 12 months in wholesale prices 6*02 per cent, and in the retail 7.69 per cent.   Butterhas gonfe down 19.29 from 12 months ago in the wholesale, and18,18 in the retail.   Flour is just the other way about;  ithas gone down ,66 in the wholesale, and it has gone up 3.85in the retail.   Bacon has gone down 17.04 in the wholesaleand has not been caught up by the retail;  it has gone down5,56i   Lard, of course, which is not so great an item, has gonedown lli7i Wholesale and 10 per cent, retail,   I thought thiswould interest you, as the question has been raised once ortwice as to whether the retail prices were coming down in thesame way as the wholesale prices.   So far as butter is concerned the price during the month for Danish is really unchanged,whilst Colonials have receded 4s.Od, to 5s,Od. per cwt.   Thepresent low level of counter prices, that is about ls.4d, a lb,for best butters, has created an increased consumption, butthe additional output readily meets the situation.   At this time of the year it is not unusual for tin-packers andspeculators to come in and place into store, and should they doSOi this may cause prices to advance in the near future,although last season&apos;s results turned out very unsatisfactory,and may have a tendency to check speculation to the swne extent as previously.     As regards tea, the tone of the market has been decidedlybetter, and more optimism on the part of the buyers hasprevailed than for some time, due partially to the betterstatistical position.   The reports arising from flood damage to ceylon and Northern India new crops show a combined decline to date of 2,250,000 lbs, as against last year.     So far as coffee is concerned, during the latter partof the month a good assortment of good keeping quality gradeshas been offered at higher prices, and British East Africanoffered a steady market, but the selection has been poor and prices for such parcels ruled in favour of buyers,,   Indianswere in poor demand in the first part of the month, but laterthere was a fair demand at steady prices.     Then on the question of wheat, the Farm Board of theUnited States and the Fool in Canada are having a growinginfluence on world wheat prices, and although owing to over-production their operations have been extremely difficult theyare making tremendous efforts to save the price from fallingwhen new crops begin to move in the United States from Julyonwards, in Russia from August onwards, and in Canada from september onwards.   The American Exchequer is behind this effort, and whilst the Farm Board up to now have not been very successful with unlimited funds they may have a great influence on world wheat prices in the new season.   Of course, after all,Australia is sending us and has on the way plenty of unsold
wheat, and there are good supplies in farmers&apos; hands.     With regard to India, the new crop shows a considerahlesurplus for export, and if shipments develop as we expect theywill, we shall have further supplies to compete with american and Canadian wheat.     Then there is an unknown quantity in Russia which in all probability will come forward in increasing quantities in thenear future.     There is one point which I would like to press - the selling prices of milling offals.  At the moment they are belowpre-war prices.  Whilst these offals, which are for the feeding of pigs and cattle, are so cheap that you find &quot;themalmost impossible to sell, and give very cheap food to farmers,we are importing a tremendous amount of pigs in increasingquantities.  It does seem a pity that the pig population is notincreasing and we are importing tremendous quantities of pigproducts from Denmark and the States and other places, while at the same time we are almost having to give away the offals  .that we are making in the production of flour.     I mentioned the question of furniture and how for some reason we are increasing our trade in that particular product,even though trade is so bad.     Our exports to Russia have been fair, not much thismonth;  there is no cloth, either worsted or cotton cloth inour exports there for this month.  We are doing an improvingexport of flour to Iceland, to the co-operatives of Iceland,and we are expecting to do even more than we are doing at themoment.     THE CHAIRMAN:   I understand that the question you have mentioned about pigs has been under the consideration of theImperial Economic Committee, and we will see that the information in your report about that is sent on to the Ministry ofAgriculture.     MR. VARLEY:   Thank you.     THE CHAIRMAN:   With regard to your reports about Russianwheat, do you anticipate that their scheme is going on fairlysuccessfully and that there will be larger supplies coming tothis country?     MR. VARLEY:   We have that anticipation from what we hearand the information we have privately from our Russian friends.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE IN SCOTLAND.     MR. CAIRNS:  So far as Scotland is concerned,  our last half-yearly balance can be looked upon as affording some indication of the spending power at the moment of the people who are members of Co-operative Societies.   They are mostlyworking class-people, and while it is possible to name places and industries in which depressed trade and unemployment areoutstanding, it does not seem that on the whole the spending power of the co-operative section of the community is becomingless.  Admitted those who form the membership of a co-operative society are mainly the thrifty and more prosperous of theirclass, and while it may be correct to say of them that theirspending power is being maintained, it does not follow thatthose in lower circumstances are having a similar experience.
     Our sales for the last six months exhibit so small an increase,only -59,046, equal to .09 per cent., that they may be said to havebeen stationary.  As an increase has taken place in the number ofmembers,  the small increase in the monetary value of sales might beregarded as practically a decrease.  The turnover in quantities,however,  with the exception of tea, shows a marked increase.   Insugar the increase is 10,390 tons;  in butter 256 tons;  inmargarine 124 tons;   and in flour 161 tons.     That the usual rate of consumption has been maintained from income and not from capital is shown by the fact that the sharesand loans deposited by members exhibit a normal increase.     Consequent upon having to operate throughout the half-year on a falling market, the results of the various factories aregenerally less profitable than usual.  Some of them, such as thetweed mill and the jute factory, show a heavy loss, largelycaused by depreciation of stocks.  During the half-year the Societyproduced  goods to the value of  3,086,515 or about 39 per cent, ofits total trade.     A curious feature  of co-operative production has been recentlybrought to light in our experience, one which is perhaps worthattention as an economic fact, apart from any other point.  TheSociety owns a paper mill for the manufacture of wrapping paper and produces about 40 tons weekly for its own use.  Since theimport duty was imposed upon v/rapping paper the price of thearticle has increased.  The raw material is not costing any more andthe result is that the mill has become unusually profitable.   We caneither supply the various departments with wrapping paper at lessthan market price or charge market price and put the surplus intothe general profits.  Unfortunately for them feyr firms can go thelength of a mill to make wrapping paper or of a factory to makeanything  else which may become dutiable,  with the result, whichI wish to point out in a friendly and sympathetic spirit, that co-operators will in such- cases always be at an economic advantageas compared with other consumers who are not in a position to avoid the incidence of a duty.                      AUSTRALIAN. TRADE...     KR.  SANDEHSCK:  &quot;&apos;I&apos;he wool position to the 31st May is asfollows:   2,500,000  bales  have been received into store,  of which2,160,000 have been  sold.   The rates for wool have improved duringthe last month or two, and Japan has been particularly prominentin buying.     As regards wheat  the  7/heat Marketing Bill introduced by theGovernment has passed  the  Louse of Representatives and will beconsidered by the Senate immediately.  The measure provides for thepayment of wheat growers on delivery at country stations   c&amp;1930-1931 season&apos;s wheat of 4s.Od a bushel for F.A.Q.* wheat,equivalent to 4s.8d. P.O.B,  and a lower price for wheat below F.A.Q.The scheme will not  operate unless at least three States  join.  Thescheme will be administered by the Australian Wheat Board,consisting of one Commonwealth representative and one representativeof each State tfheat  Board  joining the scheme.  Members of StateBoards will be elected by  ballot of the wheat growers in  therespective States.   The Australian Wheat Board will control bylicence the export and inter-State trade in wheat and flour.  TheState i/heat Boards will control the inter-State wheat trade.  Thescheme will operate  also for 1931-1932 and 1933-1933,  and such ubsequent seasons as  may  be mutually agreed upon by the  Commonwealth nd not less than three States.  The guaranteed price of  wheat for hose seasons will be  fixed by the contracting Governments.   Any osses will be borne in equal shares by the Commonwealth  and State                       \Fair average quality.
Governments concerned.  That is the proposal that is at presentbefore the Senate in the shape of a Bill which has passed theLower House of Representatives.     THE CHAIRMAN:  It is going through?     MR. SANDERSON:   Whether it will be carried or not, ofcourse one cannot say.     The exports of wheat this season are 89,500,000 bushelscompared with 67,750,000 last season.  The late rains have verymuch improved the prospects of the wheat crop,  and a much larger area has been put under cultivation.     The exports of flour for this, season are 229,000 tons, andcompare with 301,000 tons of last year.     A Proclamation has been issued under the Wine OverseasMarketing Act prohibiting export of wine from Australia afterthe 2nd June to destinations other than New Zealand except under licence, issued by the Minister for Markets.     The figures with regard to imports and exports are asfollows:  imports  116,000,000, which is a decrease of nearly 4,000,000 compared with last year.  This is for the ten months ended April last.  The exports are  107,500,000, a decreaseof nearly  20,000,000 for the same period.     It is expected that for the quarter ending the 30th june the exports (excluding gold) will balance imports.   This balancecan hardly be maintained during the next few months, but for thewhole year ending the 30th June, 1931,  a substantial surplusis expected.     Although there is a decrease of  674,000 in May in therevenue from Customs, the revenue for the eleven months endedMay has been  39,500,000 which shows as increase of nearly 2,000,000 over last year.     Bank clearances in all the State capitals from the 1stJanuary to the 26th May are  858,000,000 a decrease of 129,000,000 compared with last year.  A meeting of the LoanCouncil this week decided to reduce the loan expenditure for thenext financial year to  24,000,000 compared with  44,000,000-lastyear and to issue immediately on the Australian market a loan for  10,000,000, 6 per cent, at par for eight years.  That loanis for local subscription, and it remains to be seen what theresult will be.     MR. VARLSY:  If three States accept the Wheat MarketingBoard, does that mean that all the others will be compelled tocome into that project;   will they have to come in compulsorily?     MR. SANDERSON:   Well, that is the  suggestion.     MR. VARLEY:  Can they compel them?     MR. SANDERSON:   It is a constitutional question rather,  andit is somewhat difficult to answer*  I  think you may assume thatthey will be forced to come in
     MR. VARLEY:  You say the total export is 29    ,-000.  Ithink Western Australia exported about 14,000 70O0 , so thatrepresents about half of the exports from Aus-tralia thisseason.  If three of the other States accept, say New SouthWales, Victoria affid someone else would they  compel Western Australia to eome in?     MR SAJDERSON:  They could do so by putting an embargo onthe wheat export from Western Australia.  It would lead to alittle trouble perhaps.     MR VARLEY:  It would be rather an interesting experiment.     Slit ERNEST GLOVER:  Would not there be  a row on the partof Western Australia?     MR SANDERSON:  I imagine so.     THE CHAIRMAN:  They would surely be bound by any decisionof the Federal Gov^rrimelat at the present time.     MR SANDERSON:  Oh yes.OOAL.     MS MITCHELL:  The position of the coal trade Is bad, andthere is no sign of any improvements  Some classes of coala-i&quot;? almost unsaleable, arid there has been a great deal ofidle uxiiife at tne oolxieries.  Some pits have closed down andmore mus-t- oXo-se if the- present conditions continue.  Thereare about-3&quot;,000&quot; fewer persons employed now than in April.     Sir Walter Raine has referred to the loss of theSwedish State Railway contracts.  This has been a seriousblow to Scotland. Only some 2,000 tons have come to Scotland,and for many years past it has been one of the stand-bys tokeep the Fife collieries going during the summer period.  Itwould appear that Poland with its subsidised railway ratesis able to take a pri.ee -wi.th---which.-it- is impossible for usto complete.IRON AND STEEL.     The pig iron-position is also bad.  There have been only 39&quot;furnaces in blast and there is a talk of six or eightbeing blown out.  Stocks of pig iron are heavy.     With regard to the steel trade, the steel works asa rule are badly off for work, and more short time is beingworked than has been the case for many years.  Scrap has been falling in price.  There are offers from the Continent atcheap prices.  The position of scrap, as you understand, hascompletely changed du.rxng the past few months.  India,n pigiron is still being imported at low prices, and there arealso offers at low prices from the Continent, prices that areImpossible for our people to compete with.
     Imports of steel are still on a large scale.  Therehave been some orders placed on the Clyde which will helpemployment;   but nothing to give any reasonable- improvementin the steel trade.  The quantities of steel involved arenot very large, and the prospects for the autumn are bad.One cannot expect much tonnage to be placed when there are so many steamers laid up.  Some of the constructional works have a fair amount of business on hand.     There is no change in the tube trade.  Short time is being worked, especially in works which do an export trade.The falling off in business with Australia has been veryserious.  The total export of tubes from the country toAustralia in the first quarter has fallen from 18,900 tonsin 1929 to 9,000 tons in 1930.  The business in large sizedtubes has not been so bad, and there is a fair tonnage oforders on hand.     There is still the same difficulty in gettingremittances from Australia, and the rate is still, I believe,something like 7 per cent.     I think I may say generally that  there is a seriouscomplaint about business in all branches; everyone seemo  tobe pessimistic about the general position at the present  time.IiTDIAH  TRADE.     LiR. LI1TDSAY:  At our April meeting I tried to give someaccount of the crop position in India during the past year19:J9-1930.  I said then that practically all the cropswere well maintained, except only oil seeds, and I explainedat the time that that account of the oil seeds position was based not on statistics of yield but on statistics of area.I have cince had the yield statistics, and I would like to correct the Impression which I gave then.  The figures arerather striking and I will put thorn in&quot;&quot;- and quote one ortwo of the main points.  The rape and mustard seed crop in1929-1930 as compared with the previous year was down inacreage by 17 per cent, but was up in yield by 20 per cent.The linseed crop was down in acreage by 10 per cent, but up  \in yield by 16 per cent.  Those are rather striking figures,showing that our expectation of a short crop based onacreage figures has been completely upset by the very goodweather conditions which -were experienced, especiallyin the spring of this year.     I should like to carry that analysis on to one further crop, the wheat crop to which iir. Varley hasreferred.  The area of our 7/heat crop last year was 2 percent, below that of the year before, and our output is32 per cent, higher;  in fact the vrheat yield for 1^29-1930at 10,362,000 tons is a record.  Ve shall probably not be dependant on outside sources for our wheat&quot; this year, but will have a surplus.     I gave some account at the last meeting of theslump in prices and how it has affected India&apos;s trade.  Ishould like to put in a statement showing exactly how we stoodduring the seven months ending April, 1930;  those are the         *See Appendix page 37.        &quot;  &quot;     &quot;  &quot;      &quot;
latest figures available.   I will put in the figures^ indetail, and I will merely say here that the wholesale index number of prices for all commodities, that is to say of ourstaple import and export commodities in India, has fallen from143, or 43 per cent. Over pre-war, to 123, between September,1929, and April 1930j  the fall is one of 20 points.     In the detailed figures there is a further point I should like to refer to.  Raw jute 1B now 20 per cent, below pre-war;jute goods only 3 per cent.  Raw cotton is 5 per cent, above pre-war-war, and cotton goods 50 per cent, above pre-war.  The pro-war jute prices on which this comparison is based were particularly high (the prices are those of July, 1914) henoethe index number is well below the pre-war rate.  But theparticular point is the difference between the indox numberof the raw material and that of the manufactured article.  Jutostands at 80;  the manufactured article at 97,  The raw cottonprioo stands at 105 and the manufactured cotton price at 150.     With regard to import and export trade we have not yet got the figure for May, but for the four months ending April there isa slight increase but not very much.   The imports during eachof those four months. January, February, Maroh and April were 17,000,000,   13,000,000,   16,000,000 and  13,500,000;  that isto say, April more or less corresponds to the figure for the short month February.   The exports were  20,000,000, 18,000,000,   21,000,000 and  18,000,000, and again Aprilcorresponds to the short month February;  so that there are indications that the slump has affected both our import and export trade in April, but not perhaps as seriously as one mighthave thought.   One will have to see now what the May figures will show.     Mr. Goodenough referred to the effect of the fall of theprice of silver on trade.  I do not know how far one candistinguish cause from effect.  The fall in silver seems to be a fall synchronous with the fall in other commodities, but at thesame time it does certainly react on the price of commodities,and I should like to give one concrete illustration,.  The seedcrushers in this country, owing to the depreciated Chineseexchange, are able to buy soya beans at a very low price, andin consequence the price that they are able to give for Indianground nuts and other competing oil seeds iB very much lower than it would otherwise be.  That is a practical instance of theeffect which only one country with a depreciated exchange mayhave on the :-prioes available for competing commodities fromother countries,     THE CHAIRMAN:  Would that difference that you werementioning between the cost of raw material and the manufacturedarticle as compared with pre-war days be explained to any extent in an increased amount of wages as compared with the pre-war position?*See Appendix p.37.     .&apos;VV.
     ME. LINDSAY:  Yes.  I think there -are r sever-al causesunderlying it,   I think one oause would be increased taxation,because taxation does not affect the oost of production of  the rawmaterial as it does the cost of manufacture.  Another reasonwould be that the manufacturer can oontrol his output and theagriculturist cannot.  Also, I should think, wages do enterinto the calculation.  It means that the purchasing power of the producer of the raw material in relation to the cost of themanufactured goods he requires is depressed.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.     SIR RALPH WEDGWOOD:  I would like to begin by referring to the statistical data issued in connection with this meeting,  where,the railway receipts are given,  and to say that those figures *are wholly misleading, as are nearly all the figures quoted at thepresent time, because they take  no account of the incidence ofWhitsuntide,  You notioe that the figure for passenger traffio  to,June shows a considerable increase as oompared with the figuregiven for a month earlier;  that includes the Saturday beforeWhitsuntide and therefore the comparison is vitiated.  Weeklyrailway figures are very seldom  reliable as an index of tradeconditions^  One must always keep the incidence of Whit sun andEaster in mind when interpreting them.  I have to say that becausethe figures that I am able to give still suffer from some error inthat respect.     At the last meeting I had to report declines in every oneof the main descriptions of traffio, and those declines,  so faras the period ending the 7th June is concerned, are still maintained and to some extent increased.   But the figures must be interpreted bearing in mind that the period that I have taken stilldoes not include Whit Monday in  the current year, and therefore the passenger figures will be unduly low, and the goods andmineral figures possibly unduly  high.  They show that for theperiod ending the 7th June, 1930, - the whole year up to  the 7thJune - our passenger train receipts are down by 2f per cent, asagainst I5 per cent, to the 3rd  May,  Merchandise receipts aredown by 2^ per cent, as oompared with 2 per cent, to the  beginningof May,   Ooal and coke receipts on the other hand,  although downby 3 per cent,, compare with 3f  per cent, decline at the  beginningof May, showing that apart from  the Whit Monday effect, whioh Iam unable to put a value upen, the deoline in coal traffic Isnot at present so severe as it was in the earlier period of theyear.     In regard to traffic as a whole the receipts are down by2f per oent, as compared with 2  per cent, in May,     As bearing on the volure of freight traffio, I have  beenable to get the statistics of tonnage forwarded separated betweenthe lower classes of traffio and the higher classes.  That showsthat taking the lower olasses of traffio and taking the period  up
to the 1st June (22 weeks) the higher classes of traffic have decreased in tonnage by 1.63 per cent.,  whilst the lowerolasses have increased by &apos;2.31 per cent.  The decrease in thehigher classes is most marked in the two large RailwayCompanies that serve the northern part of the country, theLondon and North Eastern and the London, Midland and Scottish,as compared with the Great ViJeetern and the Southern Railwaysthat serve the southern part J whilst  when you come to theheavy olasses of traffic the improvement is most marked in thetwo northern companies and less in the two southern.  In coal and coke the tonnage during the same period up to June 1stshows a decrease of .48 per cent., which is fairly evenlyspread over all the Companies.     The position of employment with railway companies is less favourable than at this time last year.  Short time workinghas been established in the greater part of the shops of theLondon, Midland and Scottish and the London and North EasternCompanies to meet the falling revenue position and the increasing costs.  So far the two southern companies, the GreatWestern and the Southern, are working full time.                         SHIPBUILDING.     SIR JAMES LITHGOW:   Mr.  Mitchell bus referred to the shipbuilding contracts on the Clyde.   It is true that one large contract has been provisionally arranged and one or twominor contracts are also talked of, but  generally speaking theposition in that industry is  that new work is not coming forward in anything like-the  volume that old work is beingworked off,  I think that is  the general position so far as Ican judge throughout the heavy industries.  There is a gradualslowing down which personally I look  forward to continuing forsome t ime.     I do not think I can give you any statistical data orotherwise but just a broad impression;  that is the effect ofall the information I have.SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.     SIR ERNEST GLOVER:   With regard to  shipping I  am sorry  tosay there is no improvement  to report.   If anything the  general position is worse.   The  freight index number shows  a further fall from 83 per cent,  to 73 per cent,  of the 1913  figure.-This is the lowest  since 1920.     Looking at some of  the  detailed markets,  the ArgentineHomeward Market, is as bad as ever and  steamers  in  many  cases have sailed away in ballast.  The general cargo  trade bothoutwards and homewards  shows no improvement.     On the St. Lawrence there is a very small businesspassing at starvation rates  of freight.     Prom Cuba a considerable business  has been  effected insugar cargoes, but  the  tendency in rates has been steadilydownward.
     In India there has been some improvement on the westside owing to shipment of wheat from Karachi.   Several steamerswere fixed, but tho demand has stopped owing to the fall ofwheat prices In Europe.   The situation generally in India both for outward and homeward business is adversely affected by thepolitical situation and trade continues to decline.  In Burmashipping has been seriously handicapped by strikes and riotsinterfering with loading causing considerable delay and preventing fresh business.     In South Africa there has been some chartering forMay shipments at low figures, the steamers proceeding in ballastfrom Brazil, owing to the absence of demand from the River Plate.Ooal shipments from South Africa are on a very low scale.     Australia remains dull and featureless.     With regard to cereals apparently the absence of anygeneral demand persists.not only in this country but in Europegenerally, and this is the continued cause of the absence of demand for shipping.     With regard to shipbuilding which has already been referredto, the statistics for the first quarter were furnished lastmonth, and there are no subsequent statistics available^.   Duringthe month of May, as far as I can learn,, there were no orders placed for tramp steamers.   The contracts reported, outside theOunarder, are for a large whale factory and a tanker, both forNorwegian account, and some small passenger steamers for coastingwork and some small whalers under 100 ft. in length.     With regard to coals, the export of coals shows an advancefrom 4,500,000 tons in April to over 5,000,000 in May,Shipment of bunker coals has also advanced from 1,200,000  to1,400,000 tons.     With regard to laid up tonnage, some of the tonnage laidup has been put into commission for Russian shipment of timber,but it is estimated that there Is still approximately 5,000,000tons deadweight of British and foreign steamers lying idle inBritish and foreign ports with unfortunately no Immediate  prospectof their being sent to sea.                            EMPLOYMENT.     MR. HILTON:  There was a further increase in unemploymentduring May.  The total number of persons on the Registers  ofEmployment Exchanges increased by 71,665 from 1,398,386 at 28thApril, to 1,770,051 at 26th Hay.  The numbers wholly unemployedincreased by 6,559 and the number temporarily stopped by 62,377,while those normally in casual employment who were unemployedincreased by 2,929,     During the period the number of men on the Register Increasedby 50,571, the number of women by 24,780,  while the number ofjuveniles decreased by 3,383,     In the London, South Eastern, and South Western Divisions,there were slight fluctuations during the month,  but by the end ofthe month, there had been a net decrease of about 10,000 in thenumber unemployed.  There were increases in each of the other divisions - the heaviest increase (52,600)  being in the NorthWestern Division.
     As might he expected from this analysis the increasedunemployment during the month is mainly accounted for by thecoal mining and cotton textile industries.     In the cotton industry the number of insured personsrecorded as unemployed increased from 170,411 or 30.7 per cent.at 23th April, to 217,030 or 39.1 per cent,  at 26th May.  Thegreater part of this unemployment was in the form of temporarystoppages.     In the coal mining industry the numbers unemployedincreased from 178,040 or 15.6 per cent, at  28th April, to237,055 or 22.1 per cent, at 26th May.  Here again the increase was mainly among those temporarily stopped.     The seasonal improvement in the building, public workscontracting and clothing industries continued, and there wasalso some recovery in the silk and artificial silk and hosieryindustries.     The total number of insured persons in  employment at26th May, was about 75,300 less than at 28th April, and about535,900 less than at 27th May, 1929.*RUBBER.     SIR GEORGE BEHARREL:   One or two meetings ago I gave avery full report on the rubber industry with certain statistics,and I do not think the changes are sufficient this month to warrant any long explanation.     Considering tyres, of course one of the main items of thetrade is the supply of tyres for new motor cars, and therefore in that important feature of the business the rubber Industryis entirely dependent upon its sister industry, the automobileindustry.  The demand for car equipment did brighten up alittle, but it has fallen away at a much earlier date than usual, which seems to indicate that not only mil that branchof the rubber industry be somewhat disappointed, but that the motor car industry itself will not reach the anticipationswhich they had hoped for in the earlier part of the year.  Ithink the general explanation is a reluctance to buy and thedifficulty in widening the field of potential motor car ownerspossibly due to taxation,  and of course poor trade and lessprofits in certain businesses.     The replacement business, which is the bulk of the tyretrade remained about steady.  There is very little expansion,and the volume of the business is still being affected by the growing improvement in the quality of the product;, which yearby year is giving a little more mileage for the price paid.At the present time the price of tyre mileage is extremely low.     As regards export, I am glad to say the figures havebeen maintained and some markets improved upon, but theposition in America particularly has made the competition inthese export markets probably more keen than ever.  It alwayswas a keen market, but now with tne curtailment of demand inAmerica they are looking anywhere to place their product, andwe are naturally feeling it in the price levels which have&apos;*See Appendis p.  35.       -16-
been obtained in those export markets, but up to now theposition has been maintained.     The more cheerful branch of the rubber industrir atthe moment is the sports business.  There is considerabledemand at home and, I am glad to say, abroad.  The export business is good, particularly with regard to tennisaccessories, where the British product seems to be making its way against American competition fairly successfully.     The boot and shoo demand is disappointing.,  I thinkit may follow the demand for all products in this country.Of course, naturally, we have very keen competition, and theproportion of the consumption of this country which ismanufactured here is really very small.  By far the bulk ofthe rubber boots and shoes are manufactured abroad, and imported here without duty.     On surgicals there is an improvement in the home market, and in certain special lines of trade again theexport business is improving, but it is a very small and very low level.     The ebonite market is practically dead,     speaking generally.     &quot;With regard to mechanicals, that of course must depend on the general level of industry in the country.  that being low the demand for mechanical rubbers is low, and is really a hand to mouth business at the present time.     As to waterproof garments, they suffer also in thegeneral trade depression, but there has been considerablebusiness in certain specialty lines which have kept some ofthe factories fairly well employed.     THE CHAIRMAN:   Sir Guy Granet is the next speaker.     SIR GUY GRA1T2T:  And he will not be a speaker, but hewill just hand in his report,* because the subject was fullycovered by Mr. Goodenougho     THE OHaJRilAN:   You have nothing to add to it ?     SIR GUY GRANET:  No.     LORD BRADBURY:   The same applies to me,     THE CHAIRMAN:   We are much obliged to you gentlemenfor your attendance.* See Appendix p.30.
APPENDIX.COAL.     MR. RIDLEY WARHAM sent the following report:-     The output of coal in the United Kingdom for  the threeweeks ended May 24th was as under:         Week ended May 10th - 4,937,000 tons          &quot;     &quot;    H  17th - 4,896,000  &quot;          w     &quot;    &quot;  24th - 4,827,000  &quot;The average output for the thirteen weeks ended May 24th(March lst/May 24th) was 4,993,000 tons, as compared with,989,000 tons for the corresponding period last year.     The number of persons employed in the industry for theweek ended May 24th was 934,000.  The average for the thirteenweeks ended May 24th was 949,600, as compared with 935,500for the corresponding period last year.     Unemployment for the month of April was 16. Qfo, as comparedwith 14.5^ in Maroh and an average of 21.9^ in 1928.     The quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom(excluding Irish Free State) In April was 4,227,419 tons,as compared with 4,570,034 tons in March.  The average valueper ton f.o.b. io April was 16/7, as compared with 16/6 inMarch.     Whilst there has been a considerable drop in the exportof coal from the United Kingdom in April, Poland., on theother hand, has increased her  exports by sea, the figuresbeing:                March  -  538,000 tons.                April  -  584,000 tons.The present position in the export coal trade is very dis-quietening.  The contract of 200,000 tons of coal for theSwedish State Railways, for delivery over the next few months,has been taken for Best polish Coal at prices about l/6 perton less than the price of Best Northumberland  Steams.Poland  1B now selling at ll/6  to  12/- per ton,  and the latestnows we have from them is that, even at these low prices, theyare suffering from idle time owing to insufficient trade.     Competition from Poland,  Germany, Belgium  and France isvery acute.  Reports from each country show that the Collieriesare having idle time, and prices  are very low.     Inland trade in this country is also very  quiet, owing tosummer  conditions so far as domestic consumers  are concerned,and the great slackness in other  industries.

IRON AND STEEL.     MR, WALKSLEY sent the following report:-     Unfortunately there is no sign of improvement and theproduction of both Pig Iron and Steel in Great Britain continuesto decline.   During the month under review ten Blast Furnaceswere blown out, reducing the number in operation at the end ofMay to 141, which is less than at any time since February 1929.A further reduction of output is still In progress, and thenumber of Furnaces operating at the end of June will be stillle s&amp;,-     The production of Pig Iron in May was 614,500 tons comparedwith 619,600 tons in April,   After allowing for the extra day in the former month, this represents a reduction of    in theoutput.
     Steel production declined from 696,100 tons in April to691,900 tons in May, but the April production was affected bythe incidence of the Easter holidays.   The March output wasabout 820,000 tons.     Imports of Iron and Steel in May amounted to 233,700tons or about 1,000 tons less than in April,     Exports of Iron and Steel amounted to 294,700 tons compared with 268,000 tons in April of this year and 442,800tons in May 1929.     There was a slight decline in the price index number in May to 114,0 compared with 114,3 in April and 114.5 in May1929.     Reports from the North East Coast indicate that tradois very slow and prospects unsatisfactory.   There is a markedreduction In unfilled tonnage on the order books, and both homeand export markets are quiet.   The number of Blast Furnaces inoperation on the North East Coast at the end of may was only 33compared with 41 a year ago, and there is a possibility of otherFurnaces being put out of blasta   The demand for Pig Iron for delivery to Scotland is on a small scale owing to increased imports of Indian and Continental Iron.   The main industriesconsuming Iron and Steel, such as Shipbuilding and ConstructionalEngineering, complain of shortage of work, and there does notappear to be any sign of recovery0   Prices of raw materialsshow a downward tendency, but the cost of Steel productiontends to increase owing to smaller outputs.     In the Midlands and South Wales conditions are alsounsatisfactory and it is becoming increasingly difficult forMakers to maintain any continuity of operation.     In Scotland there is little change in the position.The Mills are working at only a small ratio of capacity, whilothe production of Ingot Steel is lower than has been the case for some considerable time.   Steel Plants are dependent onorders received from day to day, and there is never any certainty that sufficient work will be available for more than a few daysaheado   The only bright feature in the Glasgow district is the news that the New Cunard vessel is to be built on the Clyde,During May a fairly good tonnage was launched on the Clyde, butexisting orders are quickly being completed and unfortunatelythese are not replaced by new Contractsc   There is no relief in the intensity of competition and Continental Steel, especiallyin the form of semi-finished products, is coming into thedistrict in large quantities.     The decline in Iron and Steel production is generalamong all Iron and Steel producing countries and is symptomaticof the general trade depression.   Steps which Germany is taking to meet this position have been widely published in the Press,Owing to the increased cost of production arising from a slower rate of operation, and also in view of the probable necessityfor reductions in price, negotiations have been proceeding between employers and the workpeople for a cut in wages,   witha view to stimulating demand and in the hope that greateractivity in Iron and Steel would re-act on other industries, theGovernment, through the Minister of Labour has authorised areduction in wages and salaries equivalent to 1^% on condition that prices of Iron and Steel shall be adjusted to an extent thatshall more than compensate for and shall precede the cuts in wages.iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii i itfiMiffimimfiirimnrrT&quot;-&quot;&quot;&apos;    ^&quot;&quot;TiiimrwTiBW^^.....
Revised prices have therefore been announced to take effect aa.from June 1st. but the wages reductions will come into force asfrom July 1st.  Prices are to be reduced by varying- amounts,of which the following are the most important          Sections and Bar Iron.........4/- per ton.          Thick and Medium Plates, ftc-op           Iron and Wire Rod ............ 5/-  n   &quot;          Semi-finished Products ........ 3/6d n   &quot;It should be noted that these reductions apply only to theGerman home market - a fact which seems to have been over-looked in many Press comments, where attention has been drawn to the serious consequence of these reductions to GreatBritain,.  These comments generally ignore the fact thatGermany&apos;s export prices have for a long timo been much below those in force on the home market.     These export prices will continue to be governed by France, Belgium and Luxemburg,for all ordinary qualities.  The cost of production inGermany is considerably higher than in the other countries  -mentioned, and it is very improbable that German Makers willbe willing to make any reduction in their export prices.IRON AND STEEL.     MR. PUGH sent the following report:-     A general examination of the situation of the iron andsteel industry shows no improvement in the state of depression,whioh has prevailed for many.months, and a number of Worksextended the Whitsun holiday to a full week.     In the pig Iron Trade there was a continued reduction inthe number of blastfurnaces in blast and at the end of May 141were in operation, a decrease of 10 since the beginning of themonth.  In the Cleveland area alone no fewer than 10 furnaceshave been put out of action during the present year, so thatthere are now 33 in blast  out of a total of 93.  Yet largetonnages of pig iron from India are being received in Sc-otlandU..     The total production of   pig iron for the month of Mayamounted to 614,500 tons, compared with 619,600 tons In April.     There was also a drop in the production of steel ingots- andcastings, the figure being 692,800 tons for May as against696,100 tons in April,   There is a great shortage of substantialordersj  most works in Scotland are operating only three or four days a week and some are entirely idle.  In the Sheffielddistrict more than half of the steel smelting furnaces were Idleduring the best part of May, the mills were working short time,and during Whitsun operations were suspended for seven to ten days.     While the Tinplate Trade is comparatively well engagedMessrs. Rd. Thomas &amp; Go. Limited, contemplate closing down theirOwmfelin Tinplate Works in South Wales, and this,  along with thefact that the steelworks of this Company ceased to operate lastyear, will mean that over 1,000 workpeople will be idle.
     The Galvanised Sheet Trade shows very  little  improvement,the ohief matter of interest being the re-starting of  theWhitford Works of the Grovesend Steel &amp; Tinplate Company,Limited, whioh took place at the end of May,  and approximately500 workpeople are re-engaged in consequence.     The tube trade has been bad  for some  weeks and the mills at the Newport (Mon.)  Works of the Mannesmann TubeCompany are completely idle;  whilst in Scotland a number  ofworks are at a standstill, and others are working  half time.NON-FERROUS METALS.     CAPTAIN LYTTELTON sent the following report:-   Copper i Demand in this country is again very quie-t and recent sTeotro price reductions have brought little response.Wiredrawers in the Liverpool area are reported to be wellsupplied with orders lasting till July.   Tins Home consumption so far this year compares  favourably with that on the Continent and in America.  Exports of tinplate have been on a good scale and other industriesrequiring tin have been fairly busy.   Lead; In Liverpool the cable makers recently placedseveral very good orders.  Elsewhere, however,  conditionsare dull, especially in the Birmingham Sheet and Pipe trade.Lead, however, seems in a more satisfactory position thanthe other non-ferrous metals.   ;)pelter! The Spelter consuming industries are still verydepressed?  Liverpool refers to the adverse effects of developments in the East.  In Swansea four galvanised sheetworks are closed, with all others on short time,  whilstBirmingham reports galvanisers at about 50/o capacity.                     MARINE ENGINEERING.     MR. RICHMOND sent the following report:-     In marine engineering prospects are  distinctlydiscouraging.  With the exception of Liverpool and  Belfast,all centres report that as contracts are  completed,  new orders fail to take their places0  These  last few days,however, the Clyde has been fortunate in  securing several sets of Bauer Wach conversions for the Clan Line  and anticipatessecuring two P. &amp; 0, contracts shortly.   Since the completionof the C.P.R. &quot;EMPRESS OF JAPAN&apos;&apos; the Fairfield Company  has,however, had to pay off nearly 4,000 men  and dismissals willcontinue unless fresh orders materialise  immediately.
     The outstanding feature of the month is,  of course,  the placing of the new Ounarder with Messrs.  John Brown &amp; Co.  Ltd.,at Clydebank, but the questions involved  in determining thatthe method of propulsion will be a real technical advance andnot subject to premature obsolescence are cuoh that it mustnecessarily be some time before the actual work on theengineering portion of the contract is started and begins to absorb men.  The engineering equipment of the vessel willin time, however, provide a large amount  of work, not onlyin the district itself but in numerous districts throughoutthe country and is correspondingly welcome.  Anotherinteresting event of the month is the completion by Messrs.Harland &amp; Wolff of the White Star Motor Liner &quot;BRITTANIC&quot;,the largest British Motor Ship yet built  of a gross register of 27,000 tons, her propelling machinery  consisting of twoten-cylinder double-acting, four-cycle engines.     On the Tyne, works are fairly busy with the completionof contracts, but again there is a great  scarcity of new work.Some Norwegian enquiries are about, and the river is hopingto secure some of the p. &amp; 0. vessels at  present in themarket.  Naval work still keeps several of the shops busy,and Messrs. Hawthorn, Leslie &amp; Go. have secured the order for the engines for two of the dockyard built Destroyers,Messrs. Vickers for a set of Cruiser engines and 2 Destroyers,and Messrs. John Samuel White &amp; Oo., a Flotilla Leader.     With the dearth of marine engineering work at present,and the unprecedented unemployment, it may be suggested thatthere could be no more opportune time to undertake navalreplacements and renewals. - With the reduction in our cruiser and destroyer quota, it is desirable that these should atlea3t be of the latest type and embody the most recenttechnical improvements.  Unless we accelerate our renewalprogramme within our quota, we shall have in a few years alarger proportion of obsolete vessels than is desirable.From the point of view of national economy and the provisionof work, the present would seem to be a most suitable timefor undertaking this work and deriving a two-fold advantage.     in general engineering in Scotland there are noencouraging features.  Messrs. Singers Sewing Machine Worksnear Glasgow have gone on short time in a number of departments.  Tool makers are unequally employed, although aJohnstone firm is busy on a large order for lathes for Russia.The locomotive builders still complain of lack of orders, andconstructional steel work remains quiet.MOTOR INDUSTRY.     SIR WILLIAM MORRIS sent the following report:-     The indications mentioned in the May Report are,unfortunately, materialising.     Seasonal peak production has undoubtedly ended earlier than usual, and all branches of the retail trade reportdepress ion.     There are considerable signs of dealers being  left with over-heavy stocks, and the immediate figure gives rise to considerable anxiety.
     Returns of registrations of-new oars bear witness tothis tendency.     Commercial vehicle output is also beginning to suffer.     Export figures are not up to the comparative period of1929, but the decline is not so serious as might have been anticipated by the general consequences of the world widedepression in commodity prices.  Any general improvement ofoonditions within the Empire in particular should rapidlybe reflected in our export returns.     Exports of British Motor products represent a continuallyincreasing percentage of the total export values of thecountry.     Import figures remain stagnant, and probably considerablestocks of unsold oars remain in distributors&apos;  hands.     Unemployment figures shew steady increases, and thereare no signs whatever of any improvement in the near future.     Accounts are becoming increasingly difficult to collect,and there is no question whatever that financial conditionsin all branches of the Industry during the coming monthsgive rise to growing anxiety.     The general situation shews clearly how essential it isfor a greater share of output of our factories to be spreadover markets outside this country.     Sir Cyril Huroomb wrote:-     The number of motor vehicles (excluding motor cycles)newly registered in April, 1930, was 498 less than in thecorresponding period of 1929.  This decrease was made up asfollows:-MOTOR INDUSTRY.Cars taxed on horse powerdecrease -do-649380533Goods vehiclesMotor HackneysOther vehiclesincreasedecrease2The number of motor cycles increased by 220.COTTON.SIR KENNETH STEWART sent the following report:-     During the month of May the production of cottons musthave reached the lowest level ever recorded.
INDIA.     Almost total absence of orders.    Calcutta and Madras havemade sporadic efforts to x^ut through business,  but  they have resulted in very little being done.    I hear that the -boycott  offoreign goods has resulted in the products of local mills being forced to very high prices.    Native merchants, especially in Calcutta, are said to be very anxious to carry on with  theirManchester business but are  restrained by the terrorism thatexists,CHINA.     The continued fall in silver has more to do with the absenceof orders than internal disorder, serious though this is.     Other &quot;Eastern markets are very dull indeed, though here andthere,  there are symptons of increased interest.   Ordersincreased somewhat towards the end of the month.     World-wide depression is spoiling trade elsewhere,though not bringing it to a standstill.    With the East quite  out of  themarket, even a state of moderate  activity cannot supply more thana very small proportion of the Lancashire mills with work.     Every effort is being made to stimulate the home market andpush the use of cotton goods.  Por the rest, a waiting game isthe only profitable one.   There  are certain factors which givehopi? for the future.    Japan is suffering very severely from her policy of over-forcing her export trade.   The  NipponMenkwa Kaisha (Japan cotton  trading Company) shows  a ioss of 3,800,000 for the last six months&apos;  trading.   I understand thecapital of this concern has  been  reduced from  5,000,000 to 2,000,000 and the business  has been absorbed by the GoshoMenkwa Kaisha.   This firm imported raw cotton and  exportedfinished goods.   Another great manufacturing business  theKanagufuchi Manufacturing Company which spins and weaves cotton,silk and artificial silk, appears to be in serious  trouble.No doubt the other great Japanese cotton merchanting and manufacturing firms are feeling the pinch almost as badly,though less has been heard of them.     These facts give some ground for the belief that many of  us have held for a long time, that much of the Japanese competitionwe have suffered from in the East has been grounded on  ratherunsound trading by the Japanese,  rather than some magical meansthey found of producing goods for nothing.&apos;I.&apos;     The Indian boycott situation will pass as all  these violentebullitions of feeling do pass in the East.   The fact  thatmerchants in India do desire to do business and are only prevented by terrorism from doing so is encouraging,.and there is plenty ofevidence to encourage one in the belief that the revolutionary movement has not the sympathy of the merchant class, who are ready to resume business whenever possible.     Silver must touch bottom some day and when conditions adjustthemselves to the new level, one  may hope for a revival in the china market.   The drop in price of 15;i in-three months is avery serious blow to merchants who have stocks in China.  Japansuffers more than this country as her stocks must be quite tentimes as heavy as ours in this country.
     Other interea-tlng mo*vemente in the cotton world during  themonth have been the support of oolrton by the Farm Board in NewYisrk, whioh is widely criticised.    It is apt to  recoil on theirheads as it will make the users of cotton loek to outside growthsfor their supplies.                              OOTTQN.     ME. LENNOX LEE sent the following report:-     Prices of raw cotton have tended downwards during the past month, the market in Sakellarides being particularly dullthroughout the whole period and a fall of 60 points is recorded,Egyptian Uppers also proved of little interest, dropping some30 points during the month.   There has also been a general feeling of weakness in the American Section although Spot cotton prices depreciated only slightly.     The yarn market in all sections has been dull,  orders havebeen very few and the prices obtained have, on the whole,  even after taking into account the lower price of the raw material,been lower than during the previous month.     In the piece goods branch of the industry business hascontinued disappointing.   The Indian Boycott,  which has spread to all centres, is not only causing a lack of offers but many  ofthose already contracted are being held up.   Stocks in allcentres are reported to be low with a consequent good demand fornative productions.   The further fall of over 2d.  per ounce inSilver has increased the dullness of the already depressed market in China.   So far as the Near and Middle East are concerned therehas been rather more demand from Egypt although there is still ashortage of money among the Fellahin and importers are exercisinggreater caution with credits swing to failures which have takenplace recently.   Constantinople and Syria have remained very  quietalthough the Syrian crops are reported to have been good.    It isreported that a Bulgarian commission is studying the question  of a revision of the customs lav/ in that country, but it is not statedwhether there will be any increase in textile duties.    conditions have n^t shown any improvement in the South and Central AmericanMarkets, the prices obtainable for their productions and thegeneral financial position materially affecting their purchase ofcot ten textiles of all classes-.   Some sections of the Home Trade,zn the other hand, have shown signs of revival and have no doubtbenefited  by the better weather conditions and the revealedpolicy af the Government with regard to Artificial Silk Duties.     The conditions ruling in the Finishing Branch ef the industry have been variable.   In the Bleaching Section there has been  aconsiderable falling off in the quantity of clath coming forwardsand there appears to be little prospect of improvement untilconditions in India and China become more settled.    On theShipping side of the Piece Goods Dyed Trade much the same conditions have prevailed, although the Home Trade is reported tohave been fairly well maintained.   Contrary to expectationsemployment in the Printing Section was rather better than during april.   The improvement, however, was not very marked butconsidering how increasingly unfavourable conditions in theprincipal markets have become it is satisfactory to report even aslight improvement.   The summerlike weather enjoyed in many partsof the country has stimulated a brisk demand for printed dressgoods, although the steady decline in the Overseas Trade is a source of much anxiety.
COTTON.Mr.      USE wrote :-     &quot;I regret that there is nothing whatever of  a  reassuring nature that I can put out.  we have had. a  further very considerable drop in our raw material.  Orders are practically non-existent, and those on the  books, on account possibly of the price, are going out  very slowly.  Dince the last meeting of the  Council the  whole of the trade has been running very short time, and  there is no question that unless there is almost  immediately some quick re-take in business, many more  mills will have to either run short time or to stop.      I never remember in the long period in which I have  been in the trade ouch a severe and long crisis as the  present one.11                        WOOI.ALDEPJ^iN M. F. TITTER I1TGT0H sent the following report: -     The wool-textile industry in recent weeks has been  partially immobilised by the strike, which has lasted  eight weeks.  Apart altogether from the loss of business  which has resulted, the machinery for joint negotiation  between employers and operativee has virtually broken  down.   There is no general wages agreement in the,  industrs&apos;-; consequent^ the Joint Industrial Council is  almost a deadletter.     Some employers have succeeded in obtaining the  full reduction recommended by the ^acmlolan Court of  Inquiry   namely, 9.249 per cent for time-workers.  A  few employers are still&apos; paying the old rates.  Fairly  large numbers have compromised on a temporary reduction  of 7025 per cent, or 5.8 per cent.   In a large number of  cases the power-loom overlookers have secured  preferential treatment, mainly on a 5.8 per cent  reduction.;&apos;   In addition, a number of firms in the woollen  trade secured reductions of  9.09 per cent,  or thereabouts  prior to the dispute.     I mention these figures to show the state of chaos  which exists.  It is tolerably certain that for many  months to come there will be sporadic trouble, because  employers in some districts will have a competitive  advantage over others.     One benefit which may result from the strike is that  the cost of it has been so great (owing to the unexpected  power of resistance of the operatives) that both parties  will hesitate in future before provoking a similar  conflict.  .i good deal of work will have to be done,  however, before the Joint Industri.v.1 Council is  rehabilitated and the two sides are able to resume  friendly and effective co-operation.     T/ith regard to the general position of the industry,  there was a further rise in wool values in May, and  competition for raw materiel was very keen.   Purchases  in -xustralia and -South America have been helped by the  rate of exchange, and I am told th:.t wool has  beon bought  in Australia by outside interests as a means of bringing  money home.   (This was mentioned at the meeting on 9th  April, page 8, .i.C.2lO),   Of course, wool bought in this  way has still to be sold again in rJnglcmd.
     There has been a definite improvement in business  in tops and yarns on the Continent; whilst even at  Bradford there has been a fairly substantial covering  movement, particularly in tops.  For the time being  combing machinery is fairly well employed, as the  production of tops was very small during the strike and  stocks of tops were reduced to a minimum.  Gome slight  improvement has taken place in other branches, though  spinners and manufacturers are running much less than  their normal amount of machinery.     Business at the moment is very quiet, and prices of  wool and tops are a little easier.  The spurt appears to  have been forced mainly by the cheapness of wool and the  fact that users have abandoned their hand-to-mouth buying  policy.  On the other hand, trade in fully-manufactured  goods is generally below last year&apos;s level.  In every  section it is difficult to make remunerative prices, and  there are more sellers than buyers.     There do not seem to be any prospects of improved  purchasing power either at home or abroad, and concequent-  ly a genuine recovery in the demand for clothing is  scarcely to be hoped for.  On the other hand, something   \  like a basis -has been established for wool values, and  these are still&apos;below the pre-war level and consequently  attractive.  There are different opinions as to the  effects of reduced wages in the home market, but at any  rate if- the theories surrounding reduced wages are  correct they should help us to get a slightly greater  share of the export trade                       HOSIERY.MR. WALEsJR sent the following report:-     Leicester.  Reports in general are not encouraging,  and reveal a continued slackness of business which is  attributable primarily to the general depression  throughout the country with consequent lack of  initiative on the part of buyers, and purchasing power  of the people, combined with severe foreign competition.     Apart from these considerations, trade is somewhat  dependent on weather conditions.  V/ith the advent of  brighter and warmer weather it is hoped a beneficial  effect will be noticed, on trade.     Some serious disturbance has been caused through  cancellations of  Indian contracts owing to the unsettled  conditions prevailing in that country, and it is feared  that a good deal of trade will be lost in this district  from that cause until conditions in India become more  normal.     .h fair trade is being done at the moment in white  goods but apart from that, the outerwear trade is not  tod - good.     ITottinf&amp;am,  state that there is very little improvement  to.record, although in some sections business is a little  brighter.  The total volume of trade moving is still sub-  normaln  Continuance of the present warm weather may  stimulate the demand for Underwear, as it is generally  understood that retail stocks are not very heavy.
     Prices of wool shewing., a considerable tendency toharder, orders are now beint placed for winter underwear.     In the Fancy Half Hose there is a little bettermovement.   Artificial Silk Stockings in fine gauge qualitiesare in somewhat better demand, this being the time  of yearwhen buiiv business is usually done.     As regards the Shipping trade, the Dominions are .generally proving to be the best markets, Canada,New Zealand and South Africa beint the most prominent  inthis respect at present.   Unfortunately, the same  doesnot apply to - Australia, where so far as the Hosiery tradeis concerned,  conditions appear to be going from bad toworse.     Business from the United States of America is  slow  in developing and is below normal for the time of year.Loughborough.    Trade is still bad, - unemployment  remainingabout&apos; the same as last month,- all branches of the  tradeworking short time.   The heavy importation of foreign madegoods is given as the principal reason for presentconditions.HinckleyA   Here, there is no change to report;manufacturers appear to be &quot;marking time&quot;.   unemployment is still bad,  and it is impossible to forecast any  change.Mansfield.   Short time is general in this district, andthere is considerable total unemployment.   There is no improvement evident in any section of the trade, except,possibly, the fine gauge pure silks and the very good  endof the fashioned fancy outerwear trade.CHEMICALS.     MR. HILL sent the following report 2-     All sections of the chemical trade beve been seriously affected by the condition of marked inactivity,  which,unfortunately, gives every indication of being prolonged -so much  so that it is feared that business will dwindleto almost nominal proportions.     During the first half of Hay there was certainly promise of improved conditions in the -pharmaceutical market,  which,however, was not realised.   The heavy chemical  section has beenequally affected by the depressed conditions.   In fact it  isreported that this section,  which even under the worst  tradeconditions has been able to  show bright or promising  business,is now feeling more acutely than for many years  the depressionwhich is bearing on it, on account of the inactivity  in everyone of the consuming industries.     The position becomes even more disappointing when  it isrealized that only a very small proportion of the chemicalprodixction of the country goes direct to the ultimate consumer;the greater part of the production being absorbed in  themanufacture of other commodities.    Improvement  in the  presentsituation is a factor entirely out of the control of  the chemical manufacturer, aixl must rest with the efforts of the chemical user.
BANKING,     SIR GUY GRAN3T handed in the following report:-     For the period covered since my last report on May15th to the Whitsuntide holiday, there was very little changein the monetary situation.   Day to day money remainedplentiful at about 2 - l^/o and the rate for three months BankBills 2 1/8 - 2 3/16$, notwithstanding the fact that bothFrance and Germany ?/ere taking the open market gold and theformer also took about  7,000,000 of gold from the Bank ofEngland, whose stock is now about that amount less than at themiddle of May,     Tuesday, June 10th witnessed a decided change in theposition.    The effect of the disbursement of the War Loandividend on June 1st had apparently quickly worn off,  andBankers Deposits, according to the Bank Return on Thursday last,had fallen by over  12,000,000 since the previous week.Consequently higher rates have lately been ruling for callmoney and up to 5% has been paid, while the discount rate hassteadily risen from 2-0o to 2        The firmer conditionsoutlined above, probably to some extent due to the recent goldshipments, appear to have disposed of the possibility of afurther reduction of the Bank Rate to  2%fc, and such a movement is now regarded as extremely unlikely in the near future.     The demand for London Acceptance facilities has been goodbut there has been a slight reduction in the volume of businesssince the advent of firmer rates, although I think this movement is seasonal to some extent.     Business in the Stock Exchange has again been very dull.The gilt edged market has been the only one to  show any signsof life and the possibility of dearer money, together with therecent rather heavy new capital issues of an investmentcharacter has made business quiet even in that market.Table.

DISTRIBUTIVE TRADES.     SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE sent the following report-     Oonditions during May in the retail distributive trades,having regard to the generally unfavourable economic position,might be characterised as not having been so bad as mighthave been expected.   It must, of course, be remembered that last year Y/hitsum fell in May, so that this year, May had thefull advantage of pre-Y/hitsum trade, as well as an  extraworking day.   Moreover, last year trade was much disturbed by the General Election; &apos;on the other hand, weather conditions this year were distinctly worse, and fluctuations in the weather were reflected to a more than usually markeddegree in variations in trade.     The month commenced very favourably, but business felloff to a disappointing extent during the middle of the monthwhen weather conditions were unusually bad, and only began to recover again during the last week, when the approach ofV/hitsum and brighter weather had an immediate effect in stimulating trade.     Reference must again be made to the continued fall in retail prices, and to the marked preference shown for cheapermerchandise by the public,  who are only purchasing to meetimmediate requirements.   It is not surprising, therefore,that the higher class trade are still finding conditionsdifficult, but it is significant that from the lower end ofthe trade also, reports to hand draw attention to localunemployment as being the cause of an increase not previouslyobserved in the non-payment of hire purchase instalments.  Onthe whole, however, and having regard to all the circumstances,trade although far from satisfactory might have been verymuch worse.     In the West End, the piece goods and women1s weardepartments show no decided tendencies, some houses havingsucceeded in increasing their sales and others reportingmoderate falls;  the total sales of piece goods are probablyslight^  down and in women&apos;s; wear slightly up but thevariations are not significant.    The men&apos;s wear departments,however) again report poor sales) and the boot and shoedepartments are down by some 14$. -  Some severe decreases are reported in the furniture departments against two very small increases in turnover, but the food departments show some goodrisesi   Miscellaneous departments show,  no decided tendency,but, if anything, are slightly up.&apos;     The London Suburban Stores have felt to an increasingdegree the effects of local unemployment, and have haddifficulty in maintaining their turnover.   Piece goodsdepartments are down some 8%f and the women&apos;s wear by about$.   Men&apos;s wear departments show a slight average increaseof 4$, but boots and shoes, and furniture, are down.   Theother departments show no decided tendency, but in view ofthe general conditions it is significant that variations in either direction are generally so small in extent.     In the North,  the wool textile dispute has added to theother unfavourable factors, but results are, on the whole,not discouraging.   Piece goods departments show an averagerise of some 12% against a few small falls, while women&apos;swear departments are down some 8^, and men&apos;s wear 7%j   Bootsand shoes are fractionally up, but sales o^ furniture, as in
other parts of the country,  are somewhat seriously down.    Somegood increases are reported in the hardware departments,  andthe miscellaneous departments have generally held their own.     In the South, variations in turnover are again only of comparatively small extent.    Piece goods and women&apos;s weardepartments are ahout level, men&apos;s wear and food departments are ahout 10% up, and the hardware departments down ahout thesame percentage,    The food and sports departments show slightincreases, while the furniture and miscellaneous departments are, if anything, slightly down.     Most Stores throughout the country report that their staffs are smaller -chan at the corresponding period last year.                       RAILWAY TRAPFIOe     SIR CYRIL HURC.CMB sent the following report:-     During the 5 weeks ended 8th June, 1930, the railway traffic receipts of the four amalgamated companies were 868,000 less than in the corresponding period of 1929,  Thisdecrease is made up as follows:                                                         .

The latest statistics available are those for the month ofMarch, 1930.   Compared.with the corresponding period in 1929,the number of passenger journeys taken on all standard gaugerailways in Great Britain (excluding the London Tubes and metropolitan District Railway)  shewed a decrease of 2-g- millions,or 3 per cent, and chiefly because the figures for March, 1929,included the long distance Easter bookings the passengerreceipts in March? 1930, shewed a decrease of 21 per cent.Freight train traffic (excluding free-hauled traffic) decreased by 755,000 tons or 2-g per cent  and the receipts by  358,000 or4 per cent.   fluctuations in the tonnages of individual commodities included the following:          Commodity.

SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     MR. HOSE sent the fallowing report:-     Generally speaking, the only bright spot in South-American conditions is the further progress in the&quot;rationalisation&quot; of Chilean nitrate.  Otherwise, commercialconditions tend rather to become less favourable, and theleading exchanges are weak, again excepting Chile.     The situation In the agricultural districts of Argentinacontinues satisfactory in regard to the crops for next season:ploughing and sowing operations for the fine cereals are proceeding and the early-sown grain is sprouting well.ilarvesting and the transport of maize are being delayed onaccount of heavy rains, which&quot;in come areas have renderedthe roads impassable.     The commercial situation is still adversely affected bythe low level of world prices of cereals and other exportproducts.  On the other hand, a slight degree of comfort inpresent depressed circumstances may be derived from the- recentsmall improvement in the prices of wool, which, if maintained,renders the outlook in the patagpnian districts somewhat morefavourable.  In  the import markets, stocks of cotton andwoollen goods are heavy, and sales continue difficult tonegotiate on account of severe competition.     The Argentine Government has recently published returns of the export trade of the Republic for the first three monthsof 1950.  The total value is given at 188,155,645 pesos (gold),against 280,382,919 pesos in the corresponding quarter of 1939.The decline thus shown is stated to be due to the smallertotal volume of  exports, which was 3,872,079 tons, as comparedwith 4,417,128 tons.  Shipments of cereals and linseed amountedto only 3,280,&apos;:45 tons, against 3,746,727 tons, the aggregatevalue being 104,156,285 pesos (gpld). against 168,960,403&quot;pesos.  A marked decline occurred in shipments of wheat, whichtotalled only 883,948 tons, as compared with 2,139,852 tons,whilst linseed shipments fell from 674,848 tons to 477,076 tons.Exports of maize, however, showed an increase from 516,462tons to 790,516  tons.  Shipments of meat and meat productswere slightly less  in both volume and value;  hides exportsincreased in volume but showed a decline in total value;there was a reduction in both the tonnage and value ofshipments of wool;  but exports of the various forms ofquebracho were higher in the aggregare both as regardsquantity and value.  Exports of gold from Argentina inthe first three months of 1930 were 927,555 pesos, against31,377,870 pesos in the corresponding period of 1929.     In regard to the Argentine exchange position, thodefinite prospect of an adverse balance of payments for 1930resulting from the smaller quantities and values of shipments of produce is exerting a depressing  effect on the course ofexchange.  The latest quotation for  the peso is no hotter than4ll5/22d. as compared with the gpld parity of 47.58d.  Withthe seasonal export movement diminishing, there is nothingthat can be seen in the commercial situation to justifyhopes of a better rate, and any Improvement, therefore,can only result from borrowing abroad or the opening of the conversion Office, thus freeing the outward stream of gold.Presumably the Argentine Government has already drawn uoonthe six-months credit for US.$50,000,000 arranged in April.
They have the option of a further six-months1  renewal inOctober, and although meanwhile they may be leaving exchangeto look after itself, there can be no doubt that the questionof a long-term loan whether coupled or not with the modernisa-tion of the currency system - must in the near future occupytheir serious attention.     With reference to my previous remarks on the subject ofthe proposed consolidation of the Chilean nitrate of sodaindustry by the formation of a comprehensive combine of allthe proauce-rs, it is gratifying to be able to state that thisscheme is rapidly taking shape.  In addition, a further conference is now to take place in Ostend between the Chileannitrate of soda producers and the synthetic nitrogen interests,and it is quite within the bounds of probability that some-basis will be found for co-operation between all worldnitrogen interests.     In Chile, the national finances continue to be maintained on o, sound basis, the official returns of revenue andexpenditure for the first four months of loZ0 showing a snailsurplus of revenue.  It must be mentioned that the revenue-figures include a sum of some 78,000,000 pesos, representingthe surplus brought forward from 1939, whilst a Decree hasbeen issued by the Chilean Government stipulating thateconomies to the amount of 40,000,000 pesos are to beeffeoted in the current Ordinary Budget, whilst a further10,000,000 pesos is to be eliminated&quot;&quot;from expenditure inconnection with authorisations under certain Laws outsidethe Ordinary Budget.     Advices regarding the business situation In Chile indicatethat, while retail sales in Santiago during April continued at about the same level as in March, the lower prices ofagricultural products and the restrioted nitrate and copperactivities have tended to lessen the volume of general trade *The credit situation is fair, although collections are a littleslow.     Although, in certain directions, the commercial conditionsin Brazil show some indications of improvement, the credit and exchange position remains difficult, and the sterling valueof the milrols has declined to 52^V32d.    It can only beadded that the severe nature of the recent crisis precludesa rapid recovery, and any betterment will be slow and difficult.     In Peru, prospects for the coming cotton crops arestated to be good, and it appears that the harvest may exceedearlier expectations.  Credit conditions are difficult, andthe markets for staple export products, such as cotton, sugar,wool, and copper, continue dull.   The outlook is not satisfactory.  The exchange position remains one of the chiefpoints of difficulty, and, since legal stabilisation waseffeoted two or three months ago on a new gold parity basis for the sol of 13.166 soles to the pound sterling, the marketrate has advanced to 15.20.  The Banco de Reserva del Peruhas exported an amount of some  1,000,000 in gold, representingthe surplus gold reserves resulting from the revaluation ofthe currency, but it is understood that these have not yetbeen drawn upon to support exchange.
     Trade In Mexico continues quiet, and no appreciableimprovement is anticipated for the time being.  A MiningConvention has recently been held in Mexico City to discussthe situation created by the decline in the price of barsilver, and generally to make suggestions to meet thedifficulties with which the Mexican mining industries are faced at the present time.     Conditions in Colombia have recently shown indications of rather more confidence in the general situation, althoughthe outlook is still somewhat uncertain.  The consensus ofopinion in Bogota appears to be that an improvement may reasonably be expected within the next twelve months.  Mailadvices state that transport conditions on the River Magdalenaare excellent.  In the meantime, the import movement is stillrestricted, and further postponements have been made in theconstruction of public works.  Coffee prices are nowprofitable by reason of the reduction which has been effected in wages and costs of transportation.     In Ecuador, business generally is slow and creditstringent.  The volume of imports shows a general decline, andthe outlook is dependent upon the maintenance of exportsof the country&apos;s principal products, viz. cocoa, coffee, rice,and sugar.     The improvement in the general situation in Salvadorwhich took place during February continued in the two monthsfollowing, shipments of coffee being exceptionally heavy andthe level of prices of that commodity satisfactory.  Thesubject of the formation of a mortgage bank in Salvadorcontinues to receive the attention of the National Assembly,but definite sanction ha3 not yet been forthcoming.  the drought in Venezuela broke towards the end of April, andmail advices si-ate that the outlook for the coffee cropis very favourable, provided the rains do not prove excessivelyheavy.  Business in the local markets for coffee and cocoacontinue very quiet.  Exports of coffee from Guatemala showan appreciable reduction this season, and the general volumeof business in the Republic shows come contraction.
