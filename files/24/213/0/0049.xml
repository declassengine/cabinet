M.  BRIAND&apos;S  MEMORANDUM  FOR  A FEDERATED  UNION  OF  EUROPE.   Draft Reply proposed by Committee on Proposed European Federal Union.    1.  His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United  Kingdom have examined withprofound interest the proposals for the organisation of a system of European FederalUnion made by the French Government in their memorandum of the 17th May.  Theyare of opinion that proposals so important in their purpose and in their scope require careful  and prolonged consideration.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom would furthermore feel it their duty to undertake that consideration inconsultation with all His Majesty&apos;s Governments in  the British Commonwealth.    2.  They are nevertheless  desired to comply with  the  request of the FrenchGovernment that they should send in their observations on the proposals put forward in the memorandum not later than the 15th July.  They have accordingly decided to address this note to the French Government, but they wish it to be understood thatthe comments  and  suggestions  which  it  contains are  of  a  preliminary  andtentative kind.    3.  His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United  Kingdom understand from  thememorandum that the fundamental purpose  which the French Government have inview is  to divert the attention of the  peoples of Europe from the hostilities of  thepast and from the conflicts of interest between them which are sometimes alleged to exist, and to fix their attention instead upon the more important common  interests which to-day they share.  The French  Government hope that by their proposals theymay promote closer co-operation among the nations and Governments of Europe, andthus strengthen the  safeguards against another European war.    4.  With this purpose His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United  Kingdom  arein the fullest sympathy.  It is an axiom of His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy thatthe first of British interests is peace,  and measures calculated to  ensure peace will therefore secure their ready and  warm  support.   They  earnestly hope  that  theinitiative of the French Government may bring about a better understanding by theEuropean peoples of the common interests which they share, and may thus lead both to greater mutual confidence and trust  among their Government, and to a diminution of the obstacles to international trade  and economic  co-operation which now exist. .,    5.  His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are also  in agreementwith the French Government in thinking  that it is primarily in respect of economic relations that closer co-operation between the nations of Europe is urgently to be.desired.    6.  They further agree that,  if effective  economic  co-operation  and concerted action are to be secured, it is essential that economic questions should  be considerednot one by one, nor in respect of isolated interests, but as a whole, and from the widerpoint of view of the general interests involved.  Progress on such questions depends-on the extent that Governments and public opinion  in the various countries can bebrought to realise the vital importance of their common interests and the advantageseach will derive from measures of greatpr intern^                         as.the.French. Government; recognise,  the. ihdep^country1 have to be respected, &quot;as well&apos;  as the  special  . ti.eis $fljeipting^.par.i&apos;^cular&apos;  groups of nations, much can  be done by political authorities to  promote a wider outlook oneconomic questions, and,  in so far as political action is  directed to that object,  HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom agree to the proposal made^in thememorandum for the association of economic and political authorities.      5454  [21300]   &quot;----------------1--------------------------THIS DOCUMENT .IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.                 , ,.  !   Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1930.  CONFIDENTIAL.                                            Copy  No.  3 &amp;  CP. 243  (30).                                   CABINET.
    7.  In respect, however, of the methods proposed by the French Governmentfor the realisation of their purpose,  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  in  the UnitedKingdom feel more difficulty.  They are not  confident that mature examination will show  that the establishment of new and independent  international institutions is either necessary or desirable.    8.  If they have rightly understood the proposals contained in the memorandum,the French Government suggest the creation of a new European Conference and executive Committee, and perhaps also of a new European secretariat.  These bodieswould in no way derive their  authority from the Covenant or from Part XIII ofthe Treaty of Versailles; they  would in  no way be controlled by the rules and safe-guards  which those instruments provide;  they would be in no way organicallyconnected with the League of Nations;  they would only correlate their work withthat of the organs of the League in so far as they decided by specific and spontaneousdecisions to do so in any given case that might arise.  Since the organs of the Leaguehave already begun work on virtually the whole of the programme of practical actionwhich the memorandum puts forward, it is  difficult to  see how these new Europeaninstitutions could operate without creating  confusion,  and perhaps also  a rivalry,which, however little it might be intended or desired by the European Governments,could hardly fail to diminish both efficiency  and the authority of the organs of theLeague.    9.  Apart  from this very difficult problem of co-ordination,  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom think it  possible that an exclusive and indepen-dent European Union of the kind proposed might emphasise or create tendencies tointer-continental rivalries and hostilities which it is important  in the general interestto diminish and avoid.  It is in their view essential that  the measures taken for closerEuropean co-operation should not cause anxiety or resentment in any other  continent.Unless this object is  kept continually in view,  His Majesty&apos;s  Government in  theUnited Kingdom  are satisfied  that even  wider  interests,  both  of  Europe andthe world, may be seriously endangered.   It  will be plain to the French Governmentthat in this  connexion there  are special considerations  of  which His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom, as a member of the British Commonwealth ofNations, must take account.    10.  Moreover, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United  Kingdom are inclined to believe that  the purpose which  the  French  Government  have  in  view can  be effectively secured by so adapting the proposals put forward in the memorandum asto bring them fully within  the framework  of the League of Nations.    They  areimpressed by the fact that  the Warsaw  Health Conference  of  1922, and  thereconstruction of Hungary and Austria to name only a few of many examples thatmight be  taken were matters of European interest  and concern, and yet wereeffectively dealt with by  the  existing  machinery of the  League.    They  aretherefore  convinced that it would be possible, perhaps  by establishing  EuropeanCommittees of the Assembly, of the Council and of the Technical Organisations of theLeague, or perhaps in other ways, to create whatever machinery is required for pro-promoting closer  European  co-operation without incurring the  risks  and difficultieswhich a system of new and independent institutions might involve.    11.  His Majesty&apos;s Government in  the  United Kingdom  believe, however, thatthese  are questions which can only be adequately dealt with in open discussion amongthe Governments concerned, after each  Government has had  time to examine fully and in all their aspects the proposals which have been made.   Since, for the reasonsabove  suggested, these  proposals affect intimately not  only the Governments  ofEurope, but the Governments of all the members of  the League, His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom hope that the French Government may think itdesirable  that their  memorandum should be placed  upon the agenda of the nextAssembly.    12.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the United  Kingdom earnestly  hope thatthese  tentative comments and suggestions may meet, with the approval of the FrenchGovernment,  and that by some such &quot;procedure  as that above suggested,  practicalresults of real value may be secured.          ,.July 14,1930.1
