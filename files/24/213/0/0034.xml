THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the- -Cabinet&apos;.; ! July 193CK ;-  &apos;CONFIDENTIAL.Copy No.   33O.P.  232  (30).CABINET.RUSSIA: DEBTS AND CLAIMS NEGOTIATIONS.       MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.    A DIFFICULTY has arisen in giving effect to certain provisions of the Anglo-Russian  Protocol of the 3rd October, 1929.  That protocol provided that  certain questions were to  be  settled by negotiation between the two Governments, among them being that of claims and counter-claims, inter-governmental and private, debts,claims arising out of  intervention and otherwise, and financial questions connectedwith  such  claims  and  counter-claims.  The protocol  further  provided  that theplenipotentiaries should, if  necessary, be assisted  by joint committees composed of officials or others who  should report to the plenipotentiaries the results of their jointexamination of the various  questions.  These provisions were intended to providefor a  joint expert committee to examine the question of claims, debts, &amp;c.    As the result of negotiations with the Soviet Ambassador, it was arranged thata main committee should  be appointed of  five persons  from each side, assisted byseparate  sub-committees dealing&apos;with  the following branches of the question :     (a) Nationalised  properties.    (b) Bonds and other securities.    (c) Private debts, claims and counter-claims  other than those covered by  (a)-           and (&amp;).    (d) Inter-governmental  debts, claims and counter-claims.    The  Treasury have always held the view that the question of the Governmentdebts  could not properly  be dealt with by  a committee which  would be  mainlyrepresentative of  private interests, and that a settlement of the Government  debts-was a necessary condition of the ratification of any Anglo-Soviet agreement aboutprivate claims.   In  communicating  the scheme  for  the main committee and sub-committees to  the Soviet Ambassador,  it was consequently provided that theBritish side of Sub-Committee D mentioned above was to  consist  exclusively ofmembers  of the Treasury.  It was also laid down that the work of this sub-committeewas to be reported to  the plenipotentiaries for their consideration, and to  the  main committee  for  their  information.   The main  committee would thus,  with full knowledge  of the conclusions reached  respecting inter-governmental  debts, be in aposition  to  frame  a  complete  scheme for  the settlement of the whole  questioninvolved.    The  Soviet Government, however, maintain that  this scheme would in  effectamount to the constitution of two committees, one to deal with Government debts andone to deal  with private claims.  They consider that the protocol of the 3rd Octoberdoes not commit them  to such a  procedure.  They insist therefore that the results ofthe work of Sub-Committee D should be reported to the Main Committee not only forinformation but also for consideration.    I  emphasised our view  on this question very strongly in conversation with theSoviet Ambassador on the  20th May and on the 19th June.  Again, on the 3rd  July,as a result of a letter from the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  I impressed on the ambassador that he  considered  it essential that the  Soviet Government  should,before the negotiations began, accept our point of view about the relationship betweenthe Sub-Committee on Government Debts and the Main Committee.5472  [21350]
     At this interview M. Sokolnikoff undertook to refer the matter to his Govern-ment and to give me a statement in writing of their position.  He has, however,indicated no likelihood of the Soviet Government falling in with  our  view.   he agreed  verbally  that, if Sub-Committee D  reached  any conclusions,  the  soviet representatives on the Main Committee would no doubt accept them.  But he argued that if no conclusion was  reached in the sub-committee it would be for the main committee to discuss the question of inter-governmental debts.     It would consequently  appear that an impasse has been reached, and that thereis no chance of being able to set in  motion the machinery for the consideration ofdebts and claims.   A failure  to bring the  joint committee  into  operation  will necessarily expose His Majesty&apos;s Government to considerable criticism.     It had been my intention to announce the names of the committee in the Houseof Commons on Monday the 7th July, but, in order  that I might have an opportunityof submitting the point to my colleagues,  I have asked that the question may be postponed until Monday next.     In  conclusion,  I must  warn my colleagues  that if  the  Soviet Governmentmaintain their  position it will be impossible to proceed further to give effect to theenquiry respecting debts and claims agreed upon in the protocol of the 3rd October,and  we should consequently be  faced with the necessity  of  taking a very  seriousdecision.   &quot;          ,       ,                                                 &apos; A.:&apos;H. &apos;July 8, 1930.
