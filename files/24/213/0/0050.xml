REPORT.SECTION I__INTRODUCTORY.            (a.) Composition and Terms of Reference.   1.  AT their Third Meeting (E.A.C., 3rd Meeting, Conclusion 7),the Economic Advisory Council  agreed  to  appoint  a committee with the following terms of reference:       To consider  generally what is likely to happen under a con-   tlnuanoe of the  existing policy for agriculture, and, in particular,   to consider the following questions:       (a) Will the decline continue in production from the land and            in employment on the land ?      (b) Is such a  decline consistent with national economy OF            national safety ?   2.  The Committee  is  constituted  as follows:       Mr. E. D.  Simon,  M.P. (Chairman).       Sir Alan Anderson, K.B.E.      Mr. John Beard.      Mr. W.  C.  D. Dampier-Whetham, F.E.S.      Mr. E. B.  Debenham.       Sir Daniel Hall,  K.C.B., F.E.S.       Sir  Matthew Wallace,  Bart.       Dr. B. H.  Tawney.          Mr.  A.   F.  Hemming,  C.B.E.,             Assistant Secretary, Economic             Advisory Council          Mr.  E.  E. Enfield, Ministry  of             Agriculture  and FisheriesJoint secretaries to the Committee.   In  addition,  we  have had the  benefit  of  the  services  ofMr. H. D. Henderson of the Economic Advisory Council.                  (b.) Arrangement of Report.   3.  At  our first meeting, we  thought it  convenient, for thepurpose of our Beport, to re-state as follows what we understand tobe the questions set to us by the Economic Advisory Council:    (a) How far,  and in what respect, has agricultural output and         employment declined in recent years ?   (b) How far is any suoh decline likely to continue under the exist-         ing policy for agriculture, and how far is it likely that out-         put and employment could be increased by better farming         methods1?   (c) Is this prospective  decline  sufficiently serious to justify the         Government  in  applying remedies  whioh would  under         ordinary circumstances be regarded as uneconomic and         undesirable?    ,   4.  In preparing our Beport, we  have dealt with&apos; the problem in the order indicated in the foregoing questions, Section II beingdevoted to a discussion of the changes in  the volume of agricultural production in Great Britain  between 1908 and  1925,  those beingthe years in respect of which data regarding the output of all kinds of agricultural produce are available.  In Section Hi, we indicate the changes  that have taken place  in the volume of agriculturalemployment  between  the census years  1911  and 1921, and alsothe. modifications of wages conditions  since  1911;   In Section IV;we describe  the situation with which  the various branches of     [21281]                                           B 2
agriculture are faced to-day and indicate what, in our view, are the causes which have led up to the present position.  In the following section (Section V),  we  draw a comparison  between the positionof agriculture in  this  country and  that  of other  unshelteredindustries.  At  this point  also we  consider  the effect of importson  the  foreign  exchanges.   In Section  VI, we  endeavour  toappraise the national importance of agriculture.   Section VII  is devoted to an examination of  the extent to which the position  ofBritish  agriculture  can  be improved  by  normal  methods.   Inparticular, we discuss the value  of reforms  in  marketing  and improvements  in  farming  technique.  In  Section VIII,  we  giveour answer to the question:  &quot;Is  there  a  case  for subsidies  orother abnormal methods  of help to agriculture? &quot;   Our principalconclusions are  summarised in Section IX.   5.   We desire to  place  on  record the great assistance  we havereceived from the Ministry of  Agriculture and Fisheries and fromthe Department of Agriculture for  Scotland, both of  which havefurnished us,  often at very short notice, with valuable  information on the large  number  of  points covered  by  our  enquiry.    TheMinistry  of  Health  was  also  good enough  to furnish  us withmemoranda   summarising  such  information  as  is  availableregarding  the  relative health  of rural and  urban populations  inthis  country.II. CHANGES  IN  THE  VOLUME  OF  AGRICULTURAL    PRODUCTION  AND  ACREAGE  IN  GREAT   BRITAIN    BETWEEN  1908  AND 1925.                  (a.)  Changes in Gross Output.   6.  Most of the available statistical information relating to the changes in agricultural output refers to the years 1908 and 1925,which  are the only years in  which detailed inquiries  have beencarried  out in regard to the  output of  all kinds  of  agricultural produce.  These inquiries were  made in connection with the census of Production Act,  1906,  and  afford  the best  basis  for  the comparison of the  volume  of  agricultural  output between  thepre-war and post-war periods.  In  addition,  the annual  returnscollected  by the Ministry of  Agriculture and  Fisheries  and theBoard  of  Agriculture  for Scotland  afford means  of  making  anestimate  of  the changes which have taken  place  since 1925.Exhaustive statistics regarding these changes have  been published by the  two Departments, and we therefore  only propose to call attention  to the outstanding  alterations which  have taken place since the  first census in 1908.   The following table  (Table 1) gives the estimated gross value of output of farms  in Great Britain in1908 and  1925  respectively.TABLE 1.

The figures show,  however,  certain  material changes,  themore important  of which  are  a  decrease of live-stock  and farmcrops and an  increase of  dairy  produce and  poultry and  eggs.   The increase in dairy produce is mainly attributed to the risein sales of liquid milk off farms, the production  of butter and cheese on farms  having slightly  fallen.   The changes  in the value of the  gross output of Great Britainsince the  second census  year (1925) is given  in the followingtable (Table 3) :-Table  3.

These  indicate  the changes  in the  volume  of grossoutput in  these years.&apos;   The  figures omit market garden andglasshouse  production,  for  which  comparable  figures  are notavailable.
   The decline in the value of the  gross  output  shown  in  this table  appears to  be due  to the  fall in  prices  and not  to adecline in the total volume of production.  There appears to havebeen during  this period an increase in the&apos; actual  output of live-stock from the farms, though this has resulted in  a reduction inthe numbers kept on the farms.  The total production of milk inEngland and  Wales has shown comparatively small changes overthe period, as indicated in the following  estimates:                                           Millions of Gallons.           1924-25    ............    1,1171925-261926-271927-281928-291,1361,1521,1471,181The  production  in  Scotland  is practically unchanged.                  (b.) Changes in Net Output.   8.  In  the &quot; Agricultural  Output and the Food  Supplies  ofGreat Britain,&quot; referred to in paragraph 6 above, an attempt wasmade to estimate the changes in the net agricultural output betweenthe pre-war  and  post-war  periods.   The calculations inevitably involve  certain  statistical difficulties due  partly  to  the fact  thatsome  of the necessary information  was derived from  the IndustrialCensus, and that the period covered by the  Industrial  Census (1907)does not coincide with the period of the Agricultural Census (1908),and partly to the question  of alterations  in  traders&apos; stocks.  Forsuch  reasons  that report included a comparison of the pre-war period with figures of the net output of  agriculture based on anaverage of four post-war seasons.   The  results are given in thefollowing  table (Table :4) :   , .TABLE 4.- 1 11   &quot;	About 1908.	Average of 1924-25 to 1927-28.

These figures, in effect, make  a  comparison between  pre-war and post-war years, firstly of the total sum received by farmersfor the sale off the farms of farm produce, and secondly of the total sum  expended by  farmers in the  purchase of certain  materials(mainly feeding stuffs and fertilisers). The fact that stands out fromthese figures is that in spite of high wages and low prices relative to1908, British farmers have, in the aggregate,  maintained the volumeof production.                     (o.) Changes in Acreage.   10.  The   following  table  (Table  5)  gives  the   changes inacreage in Great Britain  for the  years  1908,  1918, 1925  and1929:-

The rise in the  area of the arable land between 1908 and1918 and  the corresponding rises in the areas under wheat, barley and  oats  were,  in a large measure, due  to the  ploughing-upcampaign, associated with the Pood Production Department duringthe War.  After the War,  the decline in&quot; the arable acreage whichhad been  in progress  for nearly 50 years once more set in, andby 1924 the arable acreage in England and  Wales had  fallen  tothe 1914  figure.   Since  that date,  approximately another million acres  in England and  Wales have  been lost to the  plough.   12.  In  Scotland, the arable area had fallen to the 1914 levelin 1923, and since then almost another 200,000  acres have been lost, but the increase of the arable  area during the War was much less than in England and Wales.   13.  The feature of Table 5 is the rise in the area of arable land ofover 1,000,000  acres between 1908  and 1918, followed by a fallingaway of nearly 3,000,000 acres in the last eleven years.III. CHANGES  IN  EMPLOYMENT  AND  WAGES  CONDI-             TIONS BETWEEN  1911  AND  1921.           (a.)  Changes in the Volume of Employment.   14.  The number of persons engaged in  agriculture  in  GreatBritain has shown a downward  tendency for  more than 50 years,This is the result partly  of improved methods of cultivation andthe greater use of farm machinery, and partly of,the laying down of arable land to grass.  We do not propose  here to draw conclu-sions,  but  only to record facts.  No exact estimate  is  availableregarding the effect on  employment of laying down arable land tograss.   According to a  statement furnished by  the  Ministry  ofAgriculture and Fisheries,  the  figures  for  the  1925 Census showthat  the total number of workers  employed per thousand acres  onholdings mainly arable  (i.e., consisting of at  least 70 per cent, of arable  land) was 36-6 against 23-1 on holdings  mainly pasture.   15.  In 1923,  the  number  of  workers employed per  thousandacres was  estimated in  a paper submitted  to  the  AgriculturalTribunal of Investigation by Sir Thomas Middleton  as 16 on grassland and 55 on arable land.  The numbers employed on arable land,however, depend upon the crops which are grown, and it  has been
estimated that potatoes employ  about 85  times and  roots about2j times the amount of manual labour required for corn.  We havereceived  from the Ministry of Agriculture  and  Fisheries a roughestimate which suggests that the kind of conversion which has been taking place in recent years of good land (capable  of growing rootsand  potatoes) from  arable to grass,  means,  for  every thousandacres  converted,  the  reduction  of  employment   of  between10 and 40 workers, the number depending mainly on  whether thearable land was previously under corn or roots.   From  the evidence given above, it  appears fair to conclude  that since 1920 the mainreduction of arable land has been in that devoted to corn growing,and that the figure for the loss of employment due to the conversionof 1,000  acres of corn land  to grass may be put at  20 workers,on  the methods of arable cultivation employed in this country.The following table (Table 6)  gives the changes in the total numberof persons employed  in agriculture in England and Wales between1871  and  1921,  based on the decennial population census.   Thefigure for 1929 has been  computed from  the annual returns of theMinistry  of Agriculture and  Fisheries.Table 6. 	Men.

Since 1921, the annual returns of the Ministry of Agriculture,whioh are calculated on a different basis, show a reduction of approxi-mately 99,000 workers.  In Scotland, the number of regular workershas remained approximately unchanged while the number of casualworkers has fallen by approximately 9,000.   18.  No  machinery  exists   for  ascertaining  accurately  theamount of  unemployment  in agriculture.   In the  past,  it  has undoubtedly been  small, but during last winter there were indica-tions of exceptional unemployment in certain districts.   A  specialinquiry carried  out by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in February1930 showed several instances of exceptional unemployment in theEastern and South-Eastern  portion of the country.  The rest ofEngland and Wales  was apparently  unaffected.  For  the  whole country, the reports  received by the Ministry  showed a  total offcetween  80,000 and  40,000  unemployed.*   These  figures  imply that agricultural  unemployment in February  1980  amounted toabout  8 per cent, of  the total number employed in the industry,out in certain  districts the  proportion  was  stated  to be  about10 per cent., and, in one,  as high as  20 per  cent.   :f Much of the information was, however, incomplete, and unsuitable asa basis of a statistical estimate.   * Computed from the annual returns collected by the Ministry of Agricul-ture and Fisheries, which show decreases between 1921 and 1929 of 10&apos;1 percent, in men employed and 19 per cent, in women.   t Computed from the annual  returns  collected by the Department ofAgriculture for Scotland which show decreases of 2 2 per cent, in men and20&apos;5 per cent, in women.
y                (b.) Changes in Wages Conditions.   19.   Agricultural wages  in  England and Wales since the war have  been  subject  to  rates  fixed under statutory  powers  in  twoperiods,  firstly, during the currency of the Corn Production Acts,and,  secondly, under  the  Agricultural Wages  (Regulation) Act,1924.  The first period covered July  1918 to September 1921.  Itwas  followed,  after  the  repeal of the Corn Production Acts,  bythe  establishment  of  Conciliation Committees,*  which were  inoperation during the years  1922 to 1924.   20.   The following  table (Table 8) gives changes in the average weekly wages  which prevailed  during the War and the post-war period.   During the period of the Conciliation Committees, when nominimum rates were in  force, the figures given are those  whichare believed to have been  the average obtaining throughout thecountry in each year: TABLE 8.

The  Agricultural Wages  (Regulation) Act,  1924,  was not extended to  Scotland,  and figures comparable with the above aretherefore not available in regard  to  Scottish wages.    22.   The last column of the above table indicates the percentage increase in weekly wages as compared with 1914.  Under  the Act,however, the  number of hours  per week which  the Wages Coin-mittees have  specified  in relation to the minimum rates of  wagesconstitute  a shorter  working week than  before the  War.  labour in excess of the week thus specified has to  be paid  for at overtimerates.   The  increase shown  in the table gives the increase inweekly  earnings on the basis of these shorter hours.  No statisticsbased on official returns are available  showing the increased  costto the farmer of employing hired labour upon his  farm per hour,after making  allowances for the reduction in the number of hoursper week and  the rates fixed for  overtime.  Certain rough estimates of this  figure  have, however, been made, and we have had  beforeus a copy of  a table published  by  the  National  Farmers&apos; Union,showing that the present cost of labour to the farmer is between 105and 110 per cent, above that of  pre-War.  Other  calculations madeat the Universities and elsewhere  appear to  corroborate the viewthat the money wages of hired labour reckoned on  an hourly basishave been approximately doubled  since the pre-War periodt   -   * These  committees were voluntary negotiating bodies  for the purpose of agreeing standard rates of wages for  their areas.   They were entitled tosubmit  their agreement to the Ministry of Agriculture for registration, theeffect of which was  that  the agreed rate became  enforceable as a civilliability on all employers in the area. Actually,  such  agreements were registered only in a trifling proportion of the cases.   t If  methods had not  changed,  tho labour cost of an  operation suchas ploughing an acre of land would also have doubled j  but,  in  practice,farmers  have been able to effect  economies  in the use of manual  labour in certain operations.

IY__THE PRESENT  SITUATION AND ITS  CAUSES.(a.)  The Present Situation.    (i.) The Geographical Distribution of the present Depression.   28.  Notwithstanding the maintenance of the general level  ofproduction  shown  in  the  statistics  to  which  we  have  already referred, there can be no doubt whatever that agriculture has beenpassing through an exceedingly difficult time.  The depression&quot; maybe said to have begun  in  the  autumn of 1920  and to have con-tinued, with minor ups and downs, ever since.  It has, however,been much more severe in the branches of farming that derive their income principally  from corn growing and to-day the most serious situation is mainly  in the arable districts.   24.  As regards the position  of  agriculture in  England andWales, the  Ministry of Agriculture and  Fisheries have furnishedus with information based upon two sets of inquiries made in 1927and 1929 respectively.   Detailed  reports were prepared for  everydistrict of- the country  by the Ministry&apos;s District Commissioners.On the basis of these reports, the Ministry divided up the countryinto five classes, giving a rough general picture of the state of farm-ing throughout England and Wales,  and  estimated  approximately the proportion of the country which could be grouped in each class.The result for the year 1927 was as follows :    25.  On revision  in  1929 of the whole set of inquiries, it was concluded  that  class  (1)  should be slightly  increased, class (2)slightly decreased;  the remainder showed little  change.   26.  The geographical distribution in  England and  Wales  ofthese five classes in  1927 was as follows:    (1) and (2).  Areas where farming conditions were on the whole       satisfactory  or fairly  satisfactory.       North of a  line from the Humber  to the  Mersey and west   of a line from the Mersey to Portland Bill, with the exception   of the Yorkshire  Wolds and Pembroke.       The  Fen districts of the following counties: Lincoln, Isle   of Ely,  Cambridge and Huntingdon.       In Derbyshire and the  dairying districts  of Berkshire and   Buckingham conditions were also fairly satisfactory.   (8) Districts where slight losses  were made.       Practically the whole of  the  South  Midlands, including the   grazing areas of Leicester, Warwick and Northampton, together   with South Staffordshire,  Hereford,  Worcester  and  part  of   Gloucester were included in this category.   Other areas falling   in  this  group  were  Pembroke,  Hertford, East Dorset,  East   Sussex,  Surrey and North Kent.   (4) Districts where farming  was unsatisfactory.       These   areas   consisted   mainly   of  comparatively  small   patches,  i.e.:  the  Wolds  of Yorkshire  and Lincoln,  North   Staffordshire,   South   Warwick,  North   Buckinghamshire,   Bedford, West  Huntingdon,  Middlesex, North and West Essex,   South Kent, East Sussex and the Salisbury  Plain  district of   Wiltshire.    * We use tho word &quot; depression &quot; in the sense it is commonly employedin this connection, viz.,  in relation to the profits earned by farmers.  Theagricultural labourer has probably never  been  less  depressed than now,owing to the increase in wages ;  but he risks  losing his employment if thedepression continues.    Proportion ofthe Agricultural Area.1. Farming on the whole satisfactory ...2. Farming fairly satisfactory3. Slight losses being made  ...4. Farming unsatisfactory5. Farming conditions badNearly half.Nearly one-fifth.   ,,  one-fifth.   ,,  one-tenth.Approximately one-tenth.
   (5)  Districts where farming conditions  were bad. .      The areas  falling into this  category  were the thin arable   lands in Hampshire, Berkshire and  Oxford.   Conditions  were   bad  in  practically the whole  of Norfolk and  Suffolk and the   southern  part  of  Cambridge.   A  further  bad  area was the   south-eastern part of Essex, with the exception of a  small region   round Southend.   27.  In 1929, the position in the north and west of the countryappeared to  have improved in comparison with 1927,  with theexception   of  the  Yorkshire  Wolds  where,  largely  owing  to difficulties  of conversion from arable to  pasture, the  position had become worse.  A decline  had  taken  place  in  north and  westEssex, thus making practically the  whole of that county a &apos;&apos; bad&apos;&apos;area.   There had also been  some decline in Bedford, Hertford andHuntingdon.  Little or no change had taken place in the remainder of the country.   28.  An independent estimate of the area and  distribution ofagricultural depression  was  made  in  1928-29 by  Mr. Dampier-Whetham,* in conjunction with the University  Department of  Agri-culture  at  Cambridge,  which, broadly  speaking,  agrees with theabove.  He has, however, paid special  attention to soil types andhis general conclusions as  to the localisation of  depression are asfollows:        &quot; To begin with East Anglia, the heaviest land is the London   clay in Essex,  covering  180,000 acres.  Similar soils from the   agricultural point of view are the  gault  in the  counties of   Cambridge  and  Bedford,  the  Oxford clay  in  Huntingdon,   Bedford,  Cambridge, and Lincoln,  and the  lias  in Lincoln.   These  lands are  all difficult to drain, they need  a maximum   amount of labour, and a  bare fallow is generally necessary  every   three or four years to keep them in good condition. Because of   this last fact,  and because clay requires time to recover  from   rain, much unremunerative work has to be expended on  these   soils.  Their total area is about 415,000 acres, and this figure   represents the  extent of  the worst conditions, where some land   has  already gone  out  of cultivation, the  area  over  which   agriculture may be called  &apos; very depressed.&apos;       The  boulder clay is  easier to work,  and  some of it grows   excellent crops.   The heavier  types of this  soil  cover  about   890,000 acres  in  Essex and  Suffolk, and  perhaps about one-   quarter of this say 100,000 acres for special reasons may be   more difficult  to  cultivate than the  rest.       The  sandy &apos; breck&apos;  lands of Norfolk  and Suffolk  occupy   170,000 acres, and the  light  chalk  soils  another  822,000   acres,  or 492,000 together.  Over this area,  as we have  seen,   conditions vary, but we  must classify most  of it as &apos; depressed,&apos;   meaning  thereby  on or  below the margin between profit and   loss.       On  good loams, over  gravel or the  lighter  boulder-clay   subsoils,  arable farmers are more  prosperous,  while from the   rich fenlands profits can almost  always  be made. But on heavy   clay &apos; breck &apos;  land and chalk, the depression is real and, over   most of the area, severe.  It  appears then  that  in the East   Anglian province, containing in all rather over 5,000,000 acres,   agriculture  is  depressed  on  perhaps  1,000,000  acres,  or   approximately  one-fifth of the whole region.       The  light chalk lands  which stretch  across the South  of   England  into  Wiltshire and Dorset resemble  those  of  East   Anglia, and cover a total area  of about  1,400,000 acres.   But   the  tops of the hills are mostly downland, and the valleys are   often well watered grass; usually  only the slopes of the hills   are  ploughed.  We may perhaps estimate their area as  about   one-third of the  whole, or 450,000  acres.   Probably most  of   this light  arable  land,  or  say 400,000 acres,  is suffering   economically,  though,  owing to  the  kinder  climate and the   admixture of  grass, less severely than East  Anglia.  Another   200,000 acres should perhaps be added  for the oolite beds which   form the arable farms of the  Cotswolds.      * See the &quot; Times,&quot; February 18th and 19th, 1929.[21261]                                            o 2
   Further inquiry may disclose other areas which should beincluded;  but, on these  facts,  we get a rough estimate of thedepressed  area  as  somewhere about 1,600,000 acres of the26,000,000 acres under crops and grass in England and Wales,or perhaps 1,000,000 acres out of a  total of  about  10,000,000acres of arable land.&quot;  (ii.) Distribution of the Present Depression by Farming Types.   29.  The Ministry of Agriculture  and  Fisheries submitted  afurther  classification based  on  farming  types,  which  may  besummarised for  the  year 1929 as follows:    (a) Mixed Farming.      This  type is general  over  the whole country,  but predominantly-   nates in the eastern half of England.  With the significant   exception of East  Anglia  and a  few small districts, farming   conditions  were  fairly  satisfactory  in  1927.   There  was  a   decided improvement between 1927  and 1929 in the extreme   north and  the extreme west (Cornwall and Devon), in both of   which counties grassland predominates.  Throughout the whole   area covered by  this type, the difference between  satisfactory   and  unsatisfactory  conditions  turned  very  largely  on  the   relative  preponderance  of  arable  land.   Wherever possible  it   was  found, that the arable area  was being  reduced, and milk   production being increasingly adopted.  In East  Anglia  condi-   tions were   bad.   The  general  reductions of  rents  on  the   heaviest lands   were  bringing  them  below  pre-war  levels.   Despite  this, arrears of rent were  reported to be increasing   heavily, more land was being given up, and  the area remaining   unlettable was increasing rapidly.   (b) Dairy Farming.      The  areas  classed  under  this  heading  include   South   Cheshire and  the  Wirral,  Central  Staffordshire,  parts   of   Derbyshire   and  Nottinghamshire,  Buckinghamshire,  and  an   extensive area  in the west  of  England comprising most  of   Somerset and parts of Wiltshire,  Gloucestershire,  Devon  and   Dorset.  At  a rough estimate, 75 to 80 per cent, of the  land in   these districts  is under grass.   Farming conditions  generally   were not unsatisfactory in 1927, and improved between 1927 and   1929.   Bents were maintained in  advance  of pre-war figures.   Farms  were re-let readily,  and  the  relative prosperity  was   attracting applications from less favoured areas.   (c) Upland Farming.       This category  covers  (1)  sheep and cattle  breeding  and   rearing  on  moorland, downland  and hill pastures.   (2) Sheep   and barley farming, which includes, on the one hand, mountain   and hill country in Wales  and the  north of England, the Peak,   Cots wolds, Yorkshire Dales, &amp;c,  and, on the other hand, the   Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Wolds, and  thin arable  area on the   chalk belt extending from  Wiltshire and Hampshire to Norfolk.    The depressed section in  this group is mainly  the sheep and   barley farms and thin arable land  on the chalk.  The rest was    satisfactory.    (d)  Market Gardening.       This includes fruit and hop growing, and also dairying and    industrial areas.   The position of farmers was not unsatisfactory    in 1927, and there appeared to be little change in 1929.    SO.   In reviewing, in April 1980, the situation set out in  the above paragraphs, the Ministry of  Agriculture conclude that  the grading of  the various areas remains  substantially the same as in 1929.  Improvement  in the general conditions  was  reported  in
Pembroke,  Warwick   and  Leicestershire.   The  position   wasworse in     (1) The  arable areas of East Anglia.    (2) The  potato  districts  of Lincoln,  the  Fens,  South-West          Lancashire and part of Yorkshire.    (8) The  market-garden area of  Bedfordshire and, to  a lesser          extent,  Worcester.    (4) The  hop growing  district of Kent and Hereford.                 (iii.)  The position as to Rents.   81.  No information was  officially  collected  as to  the  averagerent of agricultural land in England and Wales prior to the census of1925, and therefore there is no official basis upon which the averagerents in that year can be compared with pre-war years.  It is, how-ever, known that the rise in rents during and immediately after theWar was very much less than the rise in the level  of prices.  Somerise, however, undoubtedly did take place, and in certain  estatescovering 43,000  acres  in various parts  of  England and Walesamounted in 1922 to approximately 25 per cent.  By 1929, this  had fallen to about 10 per cent.   32.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have submittedcertain  particulars  regarding  rents for the years 1927  and 1929in England  and Wales.   The  conclusion reached in  1927  wasthat there had been  at that time  no  reduction of  rents,  suchas would bring the  average  back  to the pre-war level.  Only in thecases mentioned below had  abatements  become at  all general.Throughout four-fifths of the country  where farming conditions werenot unsatisfactory, the situation in 1929 was substantially the sameas two years earlier, and only in  exceptional cases  were abatementsof rent asked for or conceded.   38.  In the  unsatisfactory areas  there was a  pronounced  ten-dency in 1929 towards  the  granting  of continuing abatements  and reductions  of  rent  in the  case  of farms  which  are  unattractiveby reason  of  their large size.   The general movement was mostevident in the Yorkshire Wolds,  in  East  Anglia,  and on the  thinarable land overlying the chalk in the southern countries as far westas East Dorset.  On the clay lands of Essex, abatements of 10 to 25per cent, had  become general.  The  rents of the better-class farmswere back  to pre-war level, while those of holdings over 200 acres in the poorer  districts had fallen 15  to 25  per cent, below pre-warfigures, farms were let  at reduced rent, or even rent-free the  first year.  Arrears of rent  were  found to  be  increasing in Essex  andNorfolk. On  estates,  investigated in the  latter   country,  with  arental of ^320,000, arrears had increased  from 4 per cent, in 1927to 6 per cent, in 1929.   34.  Owing to the fact that the rise in  the cost of  upkeep uponagricultural land has been substantially greater  than the  rise of rents, the  net return to landlords has fallen considerably below its pre-war level. *   35.  In effect, the landowners have borne a share of the burdenof agricultural depression, and the low returns now received mean that few large improvements, such  as drainage  schemes,  can becarried  out, while the difficulties of carrying out the ordinary workof maintenance and repair are clearly increased.   36.  If the farmers, particularly in  the  depressed areas,  were toreceive  any material relief in the further reduction of rents, we  fear that such  a reduction of rents would  almost inevitably lead to adecline in equipment and to the gradual decay of many agriculturalestates.  Indeed, in some areas, this  has happened.   *  This matter is  dealt with  in  a presidential address delivered byMr. W. G. D. Dampier-Whetham before the  Agricultural Economics society in June 1930.
                        (iv.) Conclusions.   37.   From the evidence submitted on this part of our inquiry weconclude that    (a) Apart  from the general fall in prices, from which agriculture         has  suffered in common with other industries, serious agri-         cultural depression to-day only affects part of the country         and  some branches of farming.  More than half the country         is in a  satisfactory or fairly satisfactory condition, and the         area in which there is severe depression amounts to about         one-tenth of  the whole.   (b) Broadly speaking, conditions on the farms have been, generally,         worse the higher the proportion of income derived from the         sale of cereals.  The value of the total cereals sold off farms         in Great  Britain amounts to 9* per cent., and wheat to 4*         per  cent, of  the total agricultural  output.  Conditions are         particularly bad on farms situated  in East Anglia on heavy         clay or on infertile light  land, which  will not grow good         permanent grass.             (b.) The Causes of the Present Situation.   38.   To analyse  the causes which  have brought about  thepresent agricultural depression,  it is necessary  not merely to look at the situation as  it is to-day, but to consider the influences whichhave been  at  work during the last  decade.  As a first step  in this analysis,  it   is  necessary   to  distinguish  between  the  generalinfluences which  have  affected the farming industry in this country as a whole and the particular influences which have affected  certain branches or certain products.  We have no hesitation in concludingthat the outstanding  general cause of  the difficulties which haveconfronted agriculture in Great Britain and many  other countriesduring  the  past  ten year  has been the  fall in  prices without acorresponding fall  in costs.   39.   When we  come  to  investigate this  fall in prices, a furtherdistinction is  necessary,  namely, between those causes which leadto a  change in the  general level of  agricultural  prices  taken together, and those  which  lead  to  changes in the  prices  of individual  products  taken  separately.   Historically, it  is  thefluctuation in agricultural  prices as  a whole which has been&apos; ofthe  greatest  importance,  and  has  had  the  most  far-reachingconsequences, for  price  changes of individual  commodities  whichare not  part  of  a  general  change tend to  neutralise one another,and  they are, therefore, less injurious to the farmer.   It is  no new fact in  agricultural experience that  the industry should befeeling the consequences of  a general price  movement.   Indeed,in so  far as  adequate statistical data  are available,  it would bemore true to say that agriculture has hardly ever been in any otherposition.  The long-period  changes in fortunes of British farming from  prosperity to depression,  and again from depression toprosperity have been  more intimately  connected with changesin the general level of commodity prices than with any other singlecause.  Since the Napoleonic wars, these alternating  periods (eachof which include minor  fluctuations) are roughly as follows : Agricultural depression.     ,,      prosperity.     ,,      depression.     ,,      recovery.     ,,      prosperity.     ,,      depression.    Those periods  are familiar to  economic  students  and  these changes, between prosperity  and  depression correspond  to  thoseexperienced by other industries.    40.   The  last decade has been  a  period of  falling  commodity prices, and agricultural prices have shared in the general movement.How  closely they have done so is  shown in the following table(Table 9), which compares  the  changes in the index of agricultural prices with  the changes in the index of general  commodity prices.      *  These figures are exclusive of sales by one farmer to another.1815-18501850-18721872-18961896-19141914-19201920-1930Prices falling ...  ,,   rising ...  ,,   falling ...  ,,   rising slowly  .  ,,     ,,   rapidly.  ,,   falling ...

The close  harmony between the movement of agricultural prices  on the  one  hand,  and general  commodity prices on theother,  justifies the conclusion indicated  above that the fall in theformer is due to a cause which has affected agricultural prices, in common with  the  prices  of  other commodities, rather  than tocauses  specifically  associated  with  the supply and demand ofagricultural produce.  We do not propose to discuss to what extent the fall  in  prices  shown  in this  table  may be  due to monetarycauses.    (c.)  The agricultural consequences of a general fall in prices.   42.   The next step, therefore,  in the diagnosis of the presentsituation, is  to examine the agricultural consequences of a generalfall in prices.   48.   In agriculture, there is a longer time-lag than in most otherindustries.   A  fall in  the price  level brings  about a  disparity between the costs  of  production and prices.  It does so, broadly speaking, in two ways.  One is due to the time-lag,t  and the otherto the effect on the relation between the fixed charges in agricultureand  the prices of agricultural produce.   44.  As regards the former,  in agriculture as in certain otherindustries,  a considerable  period  of  time  elapses  between theexpenditure on  production costs  and the receipts of the proceeds of sale of farm produce.   In effect, the farmer buys  his  requi-sites  at one price level, and sells his produce at another.    If thegeneral  price  level has  fallen in the meantime,  he  makes  anunexpected loss; if it has risen,  he makes  an unexpected  profit.When prices fall very fast as they  did  between the middle of 1920and the end of 1921, this loss is of  great importance.  Moreover,the  downward movement of the prices of certain  farm requisitesand of their costs of production tends to lag behind the downwardmovement  of  produce   prices,   thus   increasing   the  farmer&apos;difficulties.    45.  The other  direct effect of  a general fall in prices is uponthe  fixed charges in  farming, and those costs which can only be adjusted downward with difficulty.   Conspicuous amongst these ismortgage interest.   The indebtedness contracted to be paid off over   j  This  interval  of  time  has  been  investigated by  Mr.  Dampier-Whetliam and is related to what  he has termed &quot; the economic lag  in agri-culture.&quot;  By weighting various factors in  production he calculates a fixed period as though all costs were  incurred at  one  time and all sales wereeffeoted at  one time.  By this means he found the &quot; economic lag  &quot; to beabout iourteen months for a typical arable  farm and about seven months for atypical grass dairy farm.  Hence, this effect of a general fall in prices is more severe in arable than in grass dairy farming.
a period of time is incurred by the farmer on the  assumption thatthe purchasing power  of the monetary unit in which the debt hasto be repaid  will remain  the same  in future.  If  this does nothappen,  and  if,  through a  fall  in  the   general price  level,the purchasing power of  money is altered, more  farm produce isrequired to redeem the debt.   In this  country during  the  last tenyears,  the farmer who bought his  farm in  1920  or thereabouts,raising  the purchase money by way of a mortgage based on the then value of  the farm, found -that in each year of falling prices alarger and larger part  of the produce of the farm had to be sold inorder to pay the mortgage charges.   46.   Rent is not adjusted  downwards automatically  with prices.Therefore, as prices slowly fall, the burden  of  rent increases;  adisparity develops and continues to widen until some re-adjustmenthas to be brought about by  an agreement between landlord and tenant.   Hence,  a fall in rents has usually  lagged behind  a fallin produce prices, as was shown in the long depression after  1873.In the depression during the last ten  years, this  factor has been of less importance  than in the former period,  firstly  because thesystem of yearly agreements has now taken the place of the formersystem  of long leases, and secondly because the  average  level of rents did not  rise after the war by more than 20  or 25 per cent.,while the level  of prices  rose  by about 200 per cent.    Englishrents have since fallen to 10 per cent, or less  above pre-war figures and are  still falling.   47.   Wages  (which in many branches of  farming form thelargest single  item in cost of  production) have  since 1925,  to allintents and purposes, been  stationary.  As prices  have fallen, wages have remained at approximately the same level, real  wages have risen, and the farmer  who did not change his methods has found,that each year a larger and larger amount of produce must be sold offthe farm to meet the wages bill.  Wages form a higher proportion ofthe total costs in arable than in most kinds of grass  farming, and,consequently,  the general fall  in prices has once more worked itselfout with greater severity amongst arable farmers.   48.   A continuous  fall in the level of general commodity pricescreates  an  unfavourable  economic  environment,  in  which the farmer&apos;s calculations,  based  on the  ordinary data of  experience,must  almost  inevitably  be  miscalculations.   The  farmer,  forexample,  lays out a  certain  amount  of  money  on the  cost ofproduction and often incurs certain debts to banks, tradesmen andothers,  relying on his normal farm receipts to clear the debts.In so doing, he  takes the usual risk of the fluctuations  in price which are unavoidable in  farming, but his expectation is  that inthe long run  these  fluctuations will  average  themselves out.  Ina year of bad prices, due  (say) to an abundant  world  harvest, hemay  not be in a position to discharge fully his farming debts,&quot; andhe therefore  continues on credit, in the  expectation  of a futureimprovement  in  prices.   In  normal  circumstances,  this  is  aperfectly correct  use of credit, but  in periods  when  the  general level of  prices is falling, these  calculations must  inevitably bemisleading.   A year of bad prices is followed by another and yet another, and  the  expected recovery  does  not come.   One of theconsequences,  therefore, of a general fall in  prices  is  a tendency for the volume of debts to increase and to be  carried forward even after prices have  become  stable.  We  have no direct means of ascertaining  the  total volume of farm indebtedness, but  such evidence as is forthcoming from indirect sources confirms the viewthat,  particularly   in  arable   districts,   farming  is  seriouslyhandicapped  by debts  contracted at  a higher  price level which remain to be paid off by the sale of produce  at lower prices.   49.   Further,  agriculture  at all  times is  exposed to relativelyviolent fluctuations consequent upon the size of world harvests, thenature of the seasons, outbreaks of disease, &amp;c. One of the effects ofa falling price level is  to create a state  of affairs, in which  agricul-ture  is less  able  to  sustain the shocks due to adverse seasons or
similar causes than it otherwise would be.  When a fall in the priceof an agricultural commodity due  to  abundant foreign  supplies ora loss of profits  due to some  other  cause  has been superimposedon  a  general  fall  in commodity  prices,  a crisis amongst  the producers of that commodity has not infrequently occurred.   Thereare several  historical instances of this.  The cold and wet summer of 1879, accompanied by one of the worst harvests  and outbreaks of  disease  amongst  cattle  and  sheep,  produced  such  a  crisis.Severe  depression  was  caused in  this  way  by the  pressure offoreign wheat on the British market in the late &quot;seventies and from about  1882 to  1895.   Cold  summers  in  1891  and  1892,  anda drought in 1893, again produced a crisis.   During the whole ofthis period, commodity prices were  slowly falling owing  to the appreciation in the value  of gold.   In the post-war period, therewas the  minor crisis of 1923-1924, which mainly affected the corn-growing districts, and was largely due  to the  great expansion ofthe production of cereals in the United States of America, Canada,the  Argentine  and Australia during the War.  There was also thefall  in meat and live-stock prices in  1926 and 1927, brought about by the increased imports of chilled beef from  the Argentine duringthe  so-called Argentine meat  war,  and finally the present criticalcondition in regard  to a large part of the arable districts  due mainly to abnormally low cereal prices.    50.   During  the  last ten years all these influences have beenoperative in a greater or less degree.  In the first  part  of thisperiod the fall in prices that occurred was the most rapid for whichthere are statistical records, and but for the fact that it followedimmedately upon a period of  rapidly rising prices  (1914 to  1920),during which  large  profits were made,  agriculture  would have undoubtedly suffered a more  serious crisis.   At the end of 1923,British farmers might well have written off the previous ten years as a wholly abnormal period.    Large profits and large losses hadbeen  made,  but,  except  in  the  corn  growing districts,  whereexceptionally low cereal prices had prevailed, the position was not serious.   Nevertheless,  the  experience of the previous  three yearsand the losses which farmers had sustained had produced a certaindiscouragement; the future was looked to with  uncertainty,  indeedwith anxiety.  What agriculture then needed was a reasonably stable level of prices, a period of recuperation from the financial  difficultieswhich the three years of deflation had imposed upon it.    51.  Unfortunately, the signs of greater stability which appeared in 1924  proved to be only temporary, and in the following year andsubsequently farmers had to face a further fall in prices.  Prom thebeginning of 1925  there was a fall in the general price level which accompanied the raising of the dollar exchange to par, and from 1925onwards there have been further serious declines in the general levelof commodity prices.  Agricultural prices fell:    52.   Apart from the fall in the general price level, the other general  factor in  the  situation is  the rise in  wages, on  there-establishment  of Wages  Boards in 1925 and the constant levelthat they have since  maintained, in  spite of falling prices.   53.   We may therefore  carry  the analysis  a step further.  Thefollowing table (Table 10) compares the movement of the index ofcommodity  prices published  by  the  &quot; Statist,&quot;  firstly with  theindex of agricultural prices, and secondly with indices representingthe prices of agricultural produce grouped under the  three main headings &quot;Live-stock  and Live-stock Products,&quot;  &quot;Cereals  andfarm  crops,&quot; &quot;Fruit  and Vegetables.&quot;   The first of  these three groups represents roughly 70 per cent, of the  gross output sold offthe farms,  the second approximately  20 per  cent,  and the thirdapproximately  10 per cent.Per cent.December 1924 to December 1925 .1925  ,,     ,,    1926 ...1926  ,,     ,,    1927 ...1927  ,,     ,,    192S ...192S  ,,     ,,    1929 ...1929  ,, April    1930 ...+ 1 &apos;5 (rise)+2-1 (  ,, )-4-9[21261]D

We may therefore  turn  to an examination  of the  three groups  of farm  produce  here represented.   In regard to the live-stock and live-stock  products group, on the whole the fall in  prices has been less than the general fall in commodity prices shown in column  2.   The worst  periods  were  probably  1920-22,  Whenprices  were  falling  very rapidly, and  1925-27,  when live-stockprices  were unusually depressed on account of the heavy importsfrom  the Argentine.  Relative&apos;to the level of commodity prices,prices  in  this  group have  been good,  as  milk, which   is  animportant  component, enjoys  a  natural   protection.   The  chiefdisparity in this ease is between the index representing the moneywages  per hour of the labour employed and  the  index of prices.Labour, however,  on the whole,  forms   a  considerably  smaller proportion of the total costs of production in this group than inthe cereals and farm crops  group; moreover, against the highercost of  labour  must be  set  certain  compensating  advantages,namely      (a) low  costs of  feeding  stuffs and fertilisers,  which are  down          to almost pre-war level;    (b) the fact that the level of rents has undoubtedly been  lower          than the level of prices-.  &apos;    55.   The third group (fruit and vegetables), like the first, hason the whole enjoyed relatively  high prices  and for this reasonhas suffered less during  the period  under  review although  the drought last year had serious  consequences in certain districts.    56.   When  we  turn  to  the second group cereals  and farmcrops,  a very different state of affairs  is shown.   Not  only haveprices  fallen, but they have done so  substantially faster than thegeneral fall in commodity prices.  The relationship is the reverse ofthat in  the  live-stock group.

The third group (fruit and vegetables), like the first, hason the whole enjoyed relatively  high prices and for this  reasonhas suffered less during  the period under review although  the drought last year had serious  consequences in certain districts.    56.

Not  only haveprices fallen, but they have done so substantially faster than thegeneral fall in commodity prices.  The relationship is the reverse ofthat  in  the live-stock  group.   Furthermore, in  the cereal group
wages form a relatively high proportion of the total costs and thelow  cost of fertilisers has  gone but a little way towards compen-sating the  farmer for  the wide  disparity  between  cereal  prices and  the cost of labour.     (d.) Causes of the special Deeline of Prices of Arable Crops.                (i.) The &quot;Dumping  of Cereals.&quot;   57.  It has been alleged recently that &quot;dumping&quot;  has been an  important factor in the  present depression amongst  cerealfarmers.  The word  &quot;dumping&quot; is  used in many senses.   If a commodity  is  imported and   sold at  a loss  it is  &quot;dumped.&quot;If a foreign commodity  is sold  at less than the price in country of origin, it is  &quot;dumped.&quot;   If a foreign commodity is sold at lessthan its  average  cost.of production it is &quot;dumped.&quot;  In foreigncountries  where the  internal  value of the currency  exceeds theworld-value,  producers  are enabled  to  sell  cheaply abroad at  a profit.  This &quot;exchange&quot; or &quot;valuta&quot;  &quot;dumping&quot; has, in thepast, lost the British producer  much trade.   &quot;Dumping&quot;  in allthe senses given above has inflicted serious injury on many Britishtrades in recent years, but  agriculture has been by  no means themost conspicuous  sufferer.   To counteract  the  &apos;&apos; dumping&apos;&apos; ofcereals, there has  been  a loud  demand for State action.  farmers in England  protest against the importation of bounty-fed  wheat and  oats from Germany and barley from Bussia;  those in Scotlandagainst the  importation of bounty-fed oats.(a.)  Wheat.   58.  In  the  last four cereal years (1925-26 to 1928-29) theimports of German wheat have varied from nothing  to 3  per cent.of the total supplies.  The  total imports  of German wheat in thelast  of those years were  less  than  in the  first.   For  the  first five  months of the current cereal year they were substantially lessthan in the corresponding  period of the previous year. .: 59.  Under the  German import bond system the  exporter is undoubtedly  able  to sell wheat abroad at  lower prices  than hewould be otherwise able to  do; but naturally he sells  at the bestmarket price.  A  report recently prepared by a conference of thedepartments  concerned  states  that:      i  &quot; Examination of the prices at the more important local   wheat markets does  not   reveal   any noticeable  irregularity   between these  and the general average of England and Wales.   Any depression  which may  have occurred in  British  prices   appears to have  been  felt more or less evenly throughout the   country,  and not to have been concentrated in any particular   markets.&quot;   We are satisfied that the volume  of  imports from Germany is insufficient to have had a material effect on  prices.   60.  In regard to France, the position is more obscure.   Up to april last imports of wheat and flour under  the existing Frenchwheat law do not appear  to have been  an  appreciable  factor indepressing of wheat prices.  We understand,  however, that during may and June large additional imports  have been received  aidedapparently by some form of payment by the French Government.We  are not in a position to say what, if any,  has been the  effectof these imports  on prices, nor how long the  heavier rate ofimports is likely to be maintained.(b.)  Oats.   61.  The position in  regard  to  oats is  somewhat  different.Although  the total imports from all sources for the cereal year1928-29 were below the average, the total quantity of German oatsreceived by  the United Kingdom in that year was 1,446,000 ewt.,as compared  with  376,000 cwt.  in&apos; 1925-26.   In the  current  cerealyear there has been a  further large increase  in imports of oatsfrom Germany,  which have more than counterbalarieed a certaindecrease in imports from other  countries.   62.  The exporter of German oats, like the exporter of Germanwheat, receives assistance under the  import bond system, and tothat  extent receives an  artificial encouragement to export to this     [21261]                                            D 2
country.  Over the period  during which  German  imports havebeen increasing, the prices of oats have been falling,  and have now reached a level substantially  below pre-war, but it appears that theprice  at which  German oats have been sold in British marketshas usually been higher, and not  lower, than the prices of home produced oats.  Moreover, other factors have exerted an important,if  not  predominant, influence on the prices of oats, the chief ofthese being the general fall in the price of feeding stuffs.  It wouldseem  a fair inference frorn  the information available  that thereis  some causal  connection between  the  volume  of  German  oatsimported  during  recent  months  and the  fall  in prices.  exactly what  this  connection  is we have not been  able  to  determine.(c.) Barley.   68.  As  will be  seen from the following table  (Table  11),  barleyhas been imported from Russia  in large quantities    in  recent months.  The price of this barley  has been very low and by someit  is regarded as having been &quot; dumped.&quot;        TABLE 11. GREAT Britain and Northern Ireland.

Effect of Foreign  Tariffs.   64.  It is somewhat  surprising that public  notice  has been concentrated on the particular form of interference  with trade  incereals  referred to in the preceding  paragraphs, an interferenceadopted  by  few  countries  and  affecting  comparatively  small quantities  of  produce.  A much  more  extensive and  importantinterference has  passed  practically unnoticed.   The  &quot; dumping &quot;policy of foreign  countries in its effect on  British farmers  duringthe last few years seems to us trivial,  in relation to the progressiveincrease in tariffs on  cereals by the chief European countries.   65.  The facts are plain.   During the period since 1924 whenthe great wheat-growing countries overseas were steadily increasing their production, as  shown  in  Table  18,  the  chief  importing countries of Europe were obstructing the importation of wheat andother cereals into their own markets.  Great Britain remained theprincipal free market for the world&apos;s surplus grain, and  the risingtariffs elsewhere  concentrated  the pressure of any  surplus uponthe markets of this country.   66.  Of the countries in Europe,  which on an average  importannually a minimum of  150,000 tons of wheat, Austria, Czecho-Slovakia,  Germany,  Greece and Italy have all raised their tariffs on  cereals since  1924.  In  Denmark, the  Irish  Free State and holland the importation  of cereals has been duty free,  and nochange  in  tariffs  has  taken place in Sweden and Switzerland.  InFrance  the tariffs, though lower than  in 1924, have been increased since 1926.   The  outstanding  example  of drastic  increases  isGermany,  where  in 1924 the importation of wheat, barley and oatswas  duty  free,* while  on the  25th April,  1980,  after severalsuccessive  increases,  the duty  stood at:  wheat  7/6d.,  barley(subject to a modification in the case of cattle fodder) 7/6d. per ewt.,oats 6/0d. per cwt.   67.  These high tariffs may well have been a material factor  inthe depression of cereal prices in this country.   *  Tlie exemption of  wheat from duty was  a  special  post-war measure.Before the war there was a duty of 2s. 9d. per cwt.
                (iii.) Increased World Production.   68.  Apart from the downward trend of the general price-level,the fall in wheat  prices is clearly the  result mainly  of increased production abroad.   The  following  table (Table  12),  based  onstatistics prepared  by  the International  Institute  of  Agriculture,shows  the extent  to which  the  chief  wheat-producing countries have contributed to the world output  during the five years  priorto the War and during the four years  1925-28.

On the average,  the European output has not attained its pre-war level.   The growth  in output has been mainly due  to thegreat wheat-producing countries,  North  and  South  America and australia.   Eelative to the  pre-war figure Canada holds the fore-most place, but the production of the  Argentine and Australia alsoshows considerable increase.  The following table (Table 13), also prepared by the International Institute of Agriculture,  shows theincrease  in the area under  wheat in various countries.                 TABLE 18.

coincided almost exactly  with the area  under cultivation.    Theserious  fall in prices which took place  as a result of the recordharvest of 1928 was  mainly the result of the abundant yields inCanada,  the  United  States,  Argentina  and Australia,  following upon, in the  first three of these countries, good  harvests in theprevious year.   72.   Two  other factors, according to the statement issued bythe International Institute of Agriculture, have had some bearing on  the  wheat situation,  namely,  an appreciable decline  in theaverage  world&apos;s consumption of  wheat per head  and the gradualgrowth  during  the last four years  of  the annual  carry-over ofwheat, which  has now reached a higher figure than any previouslyrecorded.  There seems no doubt that  the policy of  &quot;holding&quot;by the  Canadian wheat pools delayed the effect  on prices of theabundant crop of 1928;  but there  remains  considerable apprehensionthat the high world-stocks  controlled by a small number of largeorganisations  may depress prices further.    78.   The  fall in price of barley  and  oats is partly due  to theinfluence of the excessive supplies of wheat in the world,  partly to heavy European production  of feeding crops  in  1928-29, andin the  ease of  oats,  to some extent to  the  imports  of  relativelycheap &quot;bounty-fed &quot;  oats from Germany  (see paragraphs  61 to 62).    74.   The  sharp fall in  price of potatoes in 1929-30 is due  toover-production in this country,  during the last two years.  Thereis no reason to expect  that potato prices will not recover.                        (iv.) Conclusions.   75.   To sum up this part of our Inquiry, we are of the opinion thatthe  &quot;dumping,&quot;  of wheat by  Germany and  other  continental countries has been  a relatively unimportant factor in depressing itsprice during  the  years under  review.   The  action of  european countries in progressively raising  their tariffs against the importationof wheat has been a more serious factor.    76.   In general, we  are satisfied that the main cause of the excep-tional fall in  the price  of wheat is to be found in the progressiveincrease in recent years of the world area under cultivation and in the record harvest of 192S.    77.   The dumping of oats has been more extensive  than that ofwheat, but the fall in the price of oats  (and in that of barley) has been largely due to the influence on the market  of wheat supplies and feed- ing stuffs which are to some extent alternatives.    78.   The sharp fall  in the price of potatoes has been due to over-production in this country during the  last  two years.Y. COMPARISON  OF THE  POSITION  OF  AGRICULTURE      WITH THAT OF OTHER UNSHELTERED INDUSTRIES      AND THE  EFFECT  OF IMPORTS  ON THE FOREIGN      EXCHANGES.        (a.) Comparison with other Unsheltered Industries.   79.  The situation which we have  examined in  the  foregoing paragraphs  is not peculiar  to  agriculture but is common to theunsheltered industries as a  whole.   The decline in world pricesduring  recent  years which has embarrassed farming  has  alsobrought depression to practically every industry which has to meetforeign  competition at home  or abroad.   Although there have been substantial  reductions  of  wages in several  of  the  unshelteredindustries  in recent years,  these reductions have  not,  as  a rule,been on a scale commensurate  with the reduction in  selling prices.A resultant disparity between wages and selling prices as comparedwith the pre-war  position is accordingly  a feature common to allunsheltered occupations;  and  agriculture by  no means provides the  most  striking example  of. this  disparity. : In  shipping,  forexample, the money level of freight rates is well: below what it was
before  the War, although wages are much  higher.   As regardsthe volume  of  production, agriculture makes  a  distinctly favour-able showing  as  compared  with  some  of  the  principal  old-established industries.   For,  whereas the volume  of  agricultural production is, if anything, somewhat greater than it was  beforethe War, there has been a  substantial decline  in  the volume ofproduction in shipbuilding and the leading textile industries.  Noris the fact that  the volume of employment has declined, althoughthe  volume  of production  has  been  maintained,  in  any  waypeculiar  to  agriculture.   In  the  main  branches of the iron andsteel industry,  for example,  where  the  volume  of  production hasincreased as  compared with  1907 by something  like 25 per cent.,employment  has declined by 24  per cent.   The production of  a given volume of output with  a smaller supply of labour is, indeed,of the  essence of the industrial tendencies of the present day.    80.   From the economic standpoint, the problem of agriculture is part of the larger problem of the depression of the unsheltered indus-tries, and there is no clear  &quot; economic  &quot;  ground for singling outagriculture, as  a whole,  as a peculiarly  strong claimant for  special assistance.         (b.) Effects of Imports on the Foreign Exchanges.    81.   There is another possibility of  a somewhat different kind which  might make it unwise  for the country to rely in so large a degree as  it does to-day on the importation of food-stuffs fromabroad.   If the export trade were to continue to decline, the task of  paying for  imports on their  present scale  might cause some embarrasment.   The  balance of trade is  already very different from what it was before the War.   Formerly, the value  of the exports  of  commodities  and services was roughly  commensurate with that of imports, and practically the whole of  the large sums due to this  country as  interest  and dividends on overseas  invest- ments was available for re-investment abroad.   To-day the  exports of commodities  and  services  are  insufficient to pay  for imports, and it  is necessary to  use  for  this purpose  a large proportion (probably something like half) of the interest on overseas  invest- ments.   Internationally  speaking, Great Britain has passed, as a nation,  from the position of a man  who spends no more than his oarned  income,  and saves the whole of his unearned income,  to that of  a man  who depends largely on his unearned income  to meet his expenditure.  This, of course, is  very far from being a desperate position;  but the tendency  is disquieting,  particularly as the future prospects of the export trade are far from good.    82.   But there is  more in this point  than that of a possible danger  in the more  or  less  remote future.   It  can be  argued that the worsening of the balance of  trade position  is already a source of some embarrassment to  the economic life of this country.   It is impossible  to invest  abroad net in any  year  more  than the amount  by which the  interest  and  dividends  due  exceed the payments to be made in respect of the balance of  trade.  To the great benefit of our trade, the world has been accustomed to come for its  loans to  the  free market of London,  and if too  much  is lent abroad the  sterling exchange  suffers  and money rates have to  be  kept up  to  correct  the  situation.    It  is  unnecessary to examine this  argument  in  any detail.   It is sufficient  for the present purpose that  the outlook as regards the exchanges  and the gold reserve over the next  few years  is by no means free from anxiety.   Whatever  weight  should  be  attached   to  the above consideration,  it has no exclusive  application  to  agriculture.   It  supplies an argument,  for whatever  it is  worth, in favour  of protective  or other  measures which would  serve  to diminish the  total  of imports.     For  the sake  of the foreign exchanges, there  would be some  advantage in reducing the volume of imparts and thus making the  balance of trade less unfavourable, but agriculture can put forward  no  claim for assistance on these grounds that cannot be put forward with  equal force by manufacturing industries which are exposed to foreign  competition in the home market.
 YI. THE  NATIONAL  IMPORTANCE  OF AGRICULTURE.   83.   We  recognise that agriculture  has special features whichdifferentiate  it from  other industries.   84.   In particular, it is often argued that a stream of emigrationfrom  country districts vitalises the towns;  that the agricultural population is healthier than  that of the town and  prevents  the deterioration of the  town dweller.  This  matter was  dealt  withexhaustively  in both the Majority and Minority Reports of the Agri-cultural  Tribunal of Investigation of 1924.   Their conclusion fromthe available evidence was, however,&apos; indefinite.  The majority con-sidered the maintenance or increase of  the  agricultural populationimportant from the national health point of view; the minority  was less impressed by this argument.  They emphasised the high cost ofa  subsidy to wheat  in relation  to the result achieved.*   Theyestimated  that  a subsidy of   7,000,000  a year might make  a difference to  the arable area of 1\  million acres; in other words,  itmight cause  the employment in agriculture of an additional  50,000men.   If the average yield is  taken at  three quarters  to the acre,this would mean a subsidy of   ,1  per quarter, or roughly a  50 percent,  increase of to-day&apos;s price of wheat.  The cost to the  nationof this increased employment  would be  140 per annum for  eachman  employed, or,  after allowance  is  made for a cheap cottage,it  might be  said  to  represent  his whole  wage  plus  40 per cent.They   concluded  that the health  argument did  not provide anadequate reason for the special treatment  of agriculture.   85.   There is no new evidence of importance since 1924, exceptthat the  health of the towns has continued to improve, and that thedifference  between town  and  country  physique  has undoubtedlybecome less.   We are inclined  to agree with the Minority Report of1924,  that there is some  advantage to the general health  of  thenation in maintaining an agricultural population, but having regardto the fact that less than 7 per  cent,  of the occupied population is  engaged in agriculture, this advantage,  when spread over  thewhole country is slight.  We also notice  that, as measured by deathrates, England is healthier than many  West European agriculturalcountries.  We are clearly of opinion that any  special  State assist-ance  to  agriculture  for reasons of national  health  would  not bejustified.   86.   A similar argument for special assistance to agriculture is often  based on the national need for home-grown food  supplies intime of war.   This again was dealt with at some  length and some-what  inconclusively in the Agricultural  TribunaFs Report. We areof opinion that, in present conditions, special measures of assistanceto agriculture,  as  an insurance against  difficulties in the event ofwar, would not be justified.   87.   There is  one other way  in which a collapse in even  one type of agriculture may affect  national interests.  It may involvethe partial  desertion  of  villages  in   the depressed  areas   anddepopulation of the  country-side.   Villages  usually  represent an establishment of  fixed capital in a manner which  provides  therequisites for a complete and  satisfactory  life.   If that establish-ment  decays, and the people are obliged to move to new suburbsround towns, much of the  amenity of life may be lost,  and  in  anycase a new provision of communal institutions churches, schools,playing-fields, &amp;c. is needed   before the  complete  framework of life  can  be  reconstructed.   It   would  be  useless  to attemptpermanently   to   withstand  economic  tendencies,   but,  if   theemergency be  temporary, it  may  be   well worth  while,  from  anational  point  of view,  to   preserve  the  economic  and socialstructure which exists till the emergency is past and that structureis  again  able to stand by itself on an economic basis.   88.   There is also one important economic aspect in  which agri-culture differs from other  industries, and that is in the immensevolume of imports of products which might be grown  within  thecountry.      ,* Report of Agricultural Tribunal of Investigation, 1924, p. 194.
   89.  Not only is agriculture still the largest single industry both as regards the amount of employment given  and the volume ofproduction, but it is unique in the  size of the home market whichmight conceivably be  captured  for home  products.   Our  totalagricultural imports of food-stuffs are about  390,000,000: of  this,about  800,000,000 are food-stuffs of  kinds which  are  produced in this  country.   Apart from  economic reasons,  there  appear tobe no technical grounds why a large part of these supplies couldnot be grown  at home.   90.  Having  regard  to  the  large  and  continued  amount ofunemployment, this great potential market at our very  doors  is amatter of the greatest importance.   It  is eminently desirable  thatwe should use all means in  our  power to  increase agricultural production in  this country to the greatest practicable extent.   91.  Since 1908,  the  volume  of  agricultural production hasbeen  maintained, but employment has fallen by about 11 per  cent.We have  shown that wages have risen in relation to prices to suchan extent that money wages calculated  on an hourly basis are  now about double what they were before the War,  whereas prices haveincreased  by  only  37 per cent.  In these  circumstances, farmershave  done well to maintain the volume of their production.   92.  The  reduction  in  employment  is by   no means  dueentirely to the reduction in arable area,  or to less intensive farming.This  is undoubtedly  one  important reason  for  the employment of less  men; but it is equally undoubted that  the adoption of betterand  more efficient methods by the farmers has  enabled them toreduce the amount of labour employed without reducing production.A substantial  portion of the reduction in employment is due to whatis now-a-days called  rationalisation,  and  is, therefore,  to be welcomed as a sign of increased efficiency.   93.  It is important  to  realise that  there  is  a definite  clash between a policy of higher wages  than  in the past, and a  highemployment  policy.   The  enactment  of the  Agricultural Wages(Regulation) Act in 1924, which  conferred statutory powers for thefixation of  wages,  was  a  definite decision on  the part of thecountry to adopt a higher  wage policy.  Money  wages  since  then have remained stable, and  the decrease of retail  prices  has meant a steady  rise of real wages.    94.   Public opinion is  still  in  favour  of  the maintenance  of wages at about  their present level, and it  is  extremely doubtful,in our opinion, whether the low wages  of the past were  favourable,on a long  view,  to  agricultural  efficiency.   It  must  be  appre-ciated that this higher level  of wages has a double effect in decreasing- employment,  firstly, in causing the  putting down of arable to grass, and  generally the adoption of types  of farming  that require less labour, and,  secondly, a keener search for  labour-saving methods.    95.   We welcome the fact that the real wages  of agricultural labourers are  higher than  they were before the War, and we hold that farmers must adapt their operations to the higher cost of labour. Though the higher level of wages is undoubtedly a source  of difficulty to farmers, we are satisfied that the level is not too high, having regard to the wages  paid by others, and especially by sheltered  trades, and that, if only to avert a drift of labour to the towns,  agricultural wages as high as those now prevailing  must be regarded  as inevitable and right.    Moreover,  we hold that the policy  adopted by  progressive farmers to meet the situation so created the policy of employing fewer men is also inevitable and that it is  the right policy.  What is important  from the national point of view is the maintenance  of farming  as a financially successful industry able to pay good wages, combined with a steady increase in the value of agricultural produc- tion. While  in particular cases we must accept the reduction in the aggregate amount of employment which has been and is going on,  in others the financial success of the farmer may enable him to intensify his  methods and thus employ more men.[21261]E
           YII. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE POSITION OF BRITISH                 AGRICULTURE  CAN BE  IMPROVED  BY  NORMAL                 METHODS.                              (a.) General Considerations.              96.  The  extent  to which it  may  be  possible  by  normal           methods to improve the position of British agriculture must depend           on the  future course  of prices.  Prices have fallen so heavily and           to such low levels in recent months that some recovery in the           wholesale index  number,  when the  present  slump  has run its           course,  can be confidently expected; and  this recovery is likely to           extend  to the prices  of cereals.  Whether the recovery will go so           far as to  take prices back to the level of  a year or two  ago is,           however,  extremely doubtful.  It would  be imprudent to ignore           the possibility that over the  next decade the downward trend of           prices may reassert itself.              97.  In  the following paragraphs,  we propose  to  examine the           extent to  which  the  situation can be  improved  by the reform of           marketing methods and of farming practice.                              (b.) Reforms in Marketing.              98.  Since  the  War,  it   has  been  generally realised   that           organised  marketing  in agriculture is  of the first importance,  and           that  it is  a  field  in which  State help  and guidance is particularly           valuable.   Much  time and  energy have  been devoted by  the           Ministry  of  Agriculture and  Fisheries and the  Department of           Agriculture for Scotland to this work.              99.  The main objects of marketing  reform are :               (a)  To secure to the farmer for  the largest possible  proportion                     of his produce the full price ruling in  the open market;              (b)  To eliminate  unnecessary  competition  between  producers,                     and to reduce waste in the processes of collection  and                     bulking,  so as to secure to  the farmer his share of the                     spread  that now exists  between  the  price paid  by the                     consumer and that received by the producer;              (c)  To advertise and extend  the demand  for  the  produce of                     British farmers.              100.  Efforts  are  being made  to achieve these objects  mainly           in two ways:  by standardisation and by organisation.                                 (i)  Standardisation.              101.  Ten years  ago,  standardisation had been adopted  to  a           considerable  extent in the Dominions and other  countries from           which   Great  Britain imports   agricultural  produce,   whereas           relatively  little has been  done in  this  country by  producers to           turn  out large quantities of uniform quality.  The  result has  been           to throw  the control of  prices  into  the  hands of traders   who           buy  and bulk  the variable parcels received from the producer.           Again, large consuming firms  tend to prefer imported produce, the           grade of which is known.  The result, in the past, was that British           produce lacked uniformity,  and for this reason often failed to secure           its full value of the market.              102.  The advantages of standardisation, where it is practicable,           are  now  sufficiently well  known to  need little  elaboration.           Standardisation inspires confidence in the buyer; enables purchase           on description to  supersede  purchase on  inspection;  facilitates           large-scale trading and transport;  and eliminates waste.  It is           essential to accurate  and  uniform  market  price quotations,   and           forms the  basis of trade reputation and advertisement.i        .      108.  Under   the  Agricultural   Produce   (Grading   and           Marketing) Act, 1928, a number of standard grades have already           been defined,  and  there is already  evidence that  these standard           grades,  and the National Mark scheme, which has been  applied to           many classes of produce,  are  proving  successful both in securing           regular  high quality  and,  to  some  extent, in improving market           prices.
                        (ii)  Organisation.    104.   The second  method of improving marketing is throughthe  organisation of  producers.  Here again, more  has  been donein other countries.  The wheat pools in Canada and Australia  areperhaps the outstanding examples.    105.   Large-scale  organisations  of  national  scope   may  dovaluable  work  in many  ways.   One  example is the  effectiveadvertisement of farm produce on a national scale, as, for instance,the advertising of the food value of  milk.  Effective bargaining withdistributors&apos;  organisations, i which are  more  and  more   being organised on a  great  scale, is  again  only possible through somecentralised organisation.  In the  same  way, large-scale organisa-tion helps to maintain a fair price for  farm produce, on the onehand,  for regulating  production  to  suit  demand  (e.g., for  theprevention of a glut such as we have recently had in potatoes, withits  corresponding disastrous break in prices), on the other hand,for maintaining  prices against the strong  pressure which can beexerted by powerful buyers.    106.   It is well known that  such organisations often break downowing to the action of  a minority, who prefer to sell independently,and thereby take full  advantage of  the  regulation  of  suppliesexercised  by the combination  without  bearing  any  share  of  itsliabilities.  Some of  us hold that it  may sometimes be necessary forthe  State to give to the majority power to compel the dissidentminority to join them in the common interest, but it is not unusualto find the most efficient and go-ahead men among the minority.In our view, the power to compel a  minority to adhere to a common policy  should  be  used sparingly and only when a  lack  of  unitydefinitely obstructs  progress.    107.   In  addition  to its direct advantages,  the organisationof farmers into  corporate  bodies  for  the purpose  of  marketingprovides   a  means  by  which  many  indirect  advantages  canbe  gained.   It  is bound to have some  beneficial influence  on production,  as  it has done  in  Denmark,  the United States and elsewhere, in inducing farmers to improve breeds, to concentrate on certain lines of produce for which there is a proved demand, in short to produce  what the market wants instead of marketing whatthe  farmer chooses  to produce.   Again, organisations of farmers should prove to be a valuable medium of education through whichknowledge of  modern  methods   and   of  new  developments  incompeting countries can be disseminated.    108.   Organisation of farmers is also a  necessary precedent for finance,   if  as,   in  other  countries,   the  industry  of  british agriculture finds it necessary to seek capital from outside its ownrestricted circle.    109.   The whole question  of  the  large-scale  organisation of farmers for  marketing purposes is still in its  infancy.   It  offersgreat possibilities and  is one of  the  forms  of  rationalisation  forBritish  farming  which should  be  pushed  forward  vigorously and assisted by the Government by such means as are  at its  disposal.                  (iii)  Limitations  of Marketing.    110.   Notwithstanding these undoubted advantages, marketingreform by itself  cannot solve  the  chief  problem which  confrontsBritish farmers  to-day and  which  is at the root of the agriculturaldepression.   To  regard  marketing  as  the only,  or even  theprincipal  sphere  in which a radical change in practice is  required would be  to misconceive its importance  in  relation  to the problem as a whole.    111.   However beneficial marketing reform may prove, there willremain a problem the ultimate solution of which lies within the farmand  not outside it.  The fundamental fact of the situation which wehave sought to  analyse is the disparity  between costs of productionand prices a wide disparity where depression is acute, a less marked     [21261]                                             H 2
 disparity where it is less serious.  If this problem can be solved by the action of those engaged in the industry, it must be solved by a change not only  of marketing practice  but  of  farming practice. Furthermore, in those branches of farming which have suffered most seriously and which constitute the most immediate and most difficult problem i.e., where the main income  is derived from the sale of cereals domestic prices will  continue to be  determined by world prices, and the possible improvement which better marketing could achieve remains,  therefore, confined within relatively narrow limits. In regard to these branches  of agriculture,  the farmers  and the State alike should turn their  attention  to improving the technique of production.                         (iv.)  Conclusions.    112.  It cannot be expected that the reform of marketing can be effected so quickly as to provide a remedy for the immediate situa- tion.  But,  taking a long  view, it is clear that radical changes  in our marketing system are needed, that the ultra-individualistic marketing methods  of the  farmer  must be  drastically changed, and that successful development on  these lines  would bring advantages of great and far-reaching importance to British agriculture.             (e.)  Improvements in Farming Methods.                   (i.) General Considerations.    113.  The main item  in the farmers&apos; outgoings, which has risen disproportionately  to the  rise in prices since the pre-war period, is  wages,  which, while prices  have   continued  to  fall,  have remained  stationary  since  1925.   Farmers would  have  been confronted with the  same problem,  if the rise in  wages had been due to a  scarcity  of  labour.  British farm-wages are  certainly not out  of scale  with other  British wages.   While  lower  than agri- cultural wages in  a number of countries from which Great Britain purchases a large  part of her food-supplies, they  are higher than those  of  other  European  countries.   Their disparity with  the latter is a sign of  the higher standard of remuneration obtaining in Great  Britain, as  compared with the rest of Europe.    114.  Wages form a varying proportion of the total costs of pro- duction, amounting in the some exceptional types of farming to as much as 50 per cent., and in others to as little as 20 percent, or less. In arable farming and in intensive dairy farming the  proportion is high, running from 30 per cent, to 40 per cent.; in grass land  sheep farming and some forms of cattle grazing it  is low.   The rise of wages in the post-war period has brought farmers face to face with the problem of how to adapt farming practice to the increase of this item of farming costs. The problem in itself would not have proved so difficult in  more normal circumstances.  Progressive farmers  are alive  to the  need for  employing  labour-saving  machinery and generally  of making  the best use of the  labour that they employ. What  has added  greatly to the difficulty is that the rise of wages has  occurred  in  a &apos; time  of  falling  prices.  But  even under this handicap, much has already  been accomplished, particularly in the branches of agriculture devoted to animal husbandry, where the fall in prices has been less rapid and the amount of labour employed is smaller. The methods by which the solution of this problem must be sought obviously differ between  one  branch of agriculture and another.  The need for change  in farming practice is less marked inanimal husbandry; the chief problem relates to cereal farming.   115.  There  are certain  forms  of the  farming business  whichare independent of the cultivation of the land, and are, therefore, capable of an expansion  which is not limited by the amount ofland available.  The production of  pigs,  for  example, resemblesa manufacturing process by which materials like parley-meal andmilling offals  are  converted into meat.   The production of eggs and  poultry is a  similar  process of conversion mainly  of  cereal foods which are not  necessarily grown by the producer, but maybe purchased.  Both industries require  in themselves little  land.The  essential  requisite is cheap feeding stuffs, which are at  least
equally  available  to  British  producers  as  to  their   foreign competitors.  In  both industries, considerable advances have beenmade of late years, but British farming is  as yet far from takingfull  advantage  of the opportunities offered by  the  home  market.It has been estimated that the replacement of  the  imports  of pigproducts by home production  would provide for  the employmentof 40,000 men; similarly,  with poultry products 80,000 men couldbe employed in producing  the  current imports.  The value  of theimports  amount  to   60,000,000  and   25,000,000  respectively.The obstacles  to  the capture  of  these  industries  is  the lack  of technical knowledge  and  business  methods  on   the  part   of producers, and,  above  all, the absence  of  adequate organisationof processing and  marketing.   The production of  milk  productsimported to the value of approximately  74,000,000, which though,in part, dependent  upon  the  same class of purchased foods,  is complicated by the fact that much of the competing milk which supplies these  imports  is obtained  from grazing  land at a  much lower  cost than  is possible to us.   By  similar improvements  inthe organisation of marketing and advertisement,  it would even  bepossible to  obtain  a  great expansion of milk  production, and  itmight also  be  possible to  extend the sales of  liquid  milk  to theadvantage of our children and  our farmers.    116.  It has often been suggested that an extensive conversionof  British  farms,  with their   comparatively  large acreage, intosmaller units, workable by a singleman and his family, would resultin  a great  increase  of employment upon  the  land  and  a largerproduction  of  food.   We   do  not  wish  to enter  into a  general discussion of  the value  of  small  holdings  in  the agriculturaleconomy, but  we are agreed  that  they do  not provide a remedy for the depression prevailing in the distressed  areas.  Apart fromthe  question of the cost of  conversion, which is not recoverable  inthe  rents which  can be charged,  the  typical corn-growing land will not provide a living for the small holder,  nor will the conver-sion of what is now  arable land into such  small farms extend theemployment upon the land to any marked extent.   The value  of family farms  and their  capacity  of resistance  to falling  pricesdepends on the willingness of their occupiers  to  give their labourbelow  the  current  rates  of  pay,  but  they  cannot  add  to theproductiveness of the classes of land that  are  now suffering fromlow world  prices.   The  social value of family farms is  great.Amongst other things, they afford  opportunities of recruitment  tothe  farming business, but they must maintain themselves by taking advantage of the specialised industries like pig and poultry keeping,or vegetable growing rather than the cultivation of  staple crops.    117.  It has been  suggested  that many improvements  infarming  technique would  be  rendered possible  if cheap electric power  were made available to  farmers.   We understand  that thissubject is receiving the close attention of the Electricity Commis-sioners, who are arranging a number of  &quot; demonstration &quot; schemes in rural areas.                     (ii.) Cereal  Farming.(a)  The Conditions of the Problem.    118.  The question how far changes in farming practice can solve the problem of the disparity between the levels of wages and pricesmust, of course,  depend  on  the future course of  prices, but evenif cereal prices recovered from their present low level, they couldnot be  expected  to return to the old parity  between wages  and prices.   A new relation  between wages and  prices as  comparedwith their pre-war values must be expected to remain a permanentfeaure of British agriculture.  The implications seem to us clear;a farm  technique built  up in the past on an  abundance of cheaplabour is no longer efficient.   The transition from a practice basedon  cheap labour to a practice based on a more expensive labour isto-day,  and has been since 1925, the outstanding  problem in farmmanagement.   Nor is  the  call  for  such  re-adjustment  a  newfeature  of British farming.   Within the memory of living farmers
a sack  of wheat paid for  two weeks&apos; wages;  from the beginningof this century up to the War, when most of the present day farmerslearnt their business, a sack  of wheat paid approximately for aweek&apos;s  wages:  at present,  three  sacks would not pay  for  two weeks&apos; wages.  Much of the current distress is due to the rapiditywith which  farmers have been called upon  to  meet these  changedratios.    119.  In the difficult circumstances brought about by the fall inprices, the main change adopted by farmers is  the laying down of arable land to grass.   This has been  done partly because cerealprices fell and partly to economise labour.    120.  Conversion  of  arable land  to  grass has  frequently been regarded as  a national disaster.  The  State has at times been urged to spend vast  sums of public money to prevent  it.   We cannot accept this view.  The  agricultural policy of the State since 1924has, in effect,  been to  impose upon farmers the obligation to paythe statutory rates of wages  leaving to them  the  task of  making any adjustments  in  farming  practice  which these  conditionsnecessitate.  Obviously, the farmer has been obliged to meet theseconditions by  making certain  changes.   When  a  farmer  convertsarable land  to  grass, he must be presumed to  do so, because he believes  that   it  will  pay   or  at  any rate  minimise  losses,and that it  is the best way  within his  knowledge of meeting  the changed conditions with which he is faced.  If the  change doesnot lead to  a diminution in the&apos; value of the net output of british agriculture,  but merely to an alteration in  its character, we thinkthat the State should face the fact, even if it  involves a reduction in agricultural  employment.   It is  the logical  consequence of  theexisting policy, and if the State were  to take steps  to counteract it,a vicious circle would be  created from which  there would be noescape.    121.  Moreover, physical conditions  in  this country  have animportant bearing  on this point.  There is one  handicap underwhich wheat farmers  will continue as long as the United Kingdomremains an island in the  east of the Atlantic.  The moist, cool,changeable  climate, which gives the greater part  of  this  country the best grass in the world and helps to make it the best  nurseryfor  stock, adds greatly  to  the cost and risk of growing wheat, forwhich a continental  climate is  more  suitable.  It seems to usdangerous   to  support   a  policy which  encourages  farmers  to disregard the basic facts of their trade or to cultivate their land inany other way than that which best suits the soil and climate.    122.  On the  other  hand, physical conditions  unquestionablyplace a limit upon the land which can be converted from arable togood  pasture.   The eastern  area still remaining under the ploughwhich depends for its income largely on corn  growing, is,  broadly speaking, unsuitable  both in  soil  and  climate  for  conversion  to permanent  pasture.   Almost all  of it has  an  annual  rainfallof  less  than  30  inches,  much  of  it  less  than  25  inches,and  the  characteristic  features  is  the  low  rainfall  in  april and May.   There is thus a reasonable  expectation  of  good harvestweather, but the recurring droughts  in spring  and early summer,often  accompanied  by  high  temperatures,  are  adverse  to  thesuccess  of  permanent  pastures.   Moreover,  a large  and  rapid increase in  the production of milk,  before farmers have  learnedto co-operate and organise  their market and stimulate consumption,might glut  the market and  involve them in disaster.  The whole period since 1923-24 has witnessed the struggles of the more activefarmers in arable districts to reconstruct their system to meet the altered values.  Turnips and other root crops have  been abandonedor  reduced.  Grass sheep have  taken the  place of arable sheep.A certain number of  farmers have recast their farming, and whilekeeping their land under  the plough have looked round  in every direction in order to economise labour.  Some have resorted tofarming the land more  cheaply by a  system of three or four yearstemporary grass  alternating  with three or four years  of successivecorn  crops.   These efforts seem to us  to  have been correct,  but their success has been masked by continually  falling prices.
(b) Lines of Advance.    128.  Our problem  therefore is this:   &quot; Can the  growing ofcereals be made to pay in the depressed areas where  the climateis  not suitable for  permanent grass? &quot;    124.  An encouraging feature of the situation is that there is evidence that in most districts a few farmers have succeeded in this task even in recent years by the bold adoption of new methods andby efficient management. The technique of the nineteenth century,built up upon cheap  labour, must  give place to a new technique.Farmers in Great  Britain to-day must face  the conditions  whichfarmers in some of the great overseas producing  countries had to face in  the  past.  Home produced wheat has during the last halfcentury come increasingly into competition with wheat  grown on asystem very  different from  that  adopted in this country. Britishfarming has hitherto aimed  at high production per acre, whereas in overseas countries  the object is high production per  man.   It is interesting to note that according to estimates made by the  FoodResearch Institute at Stanford University,  California,  in the year1928-29  the  value of the wheat  crop per acre in the British Isleswas more than double the value  in the United States, Canada andthe Argentine, and more than three times that of Australia. On theother hand, the value of the crop produced per man in the overseas countries is usually much higher than in the British  Isles.    125.  We have here  an outstanding difference between Britishand Overseas farming methods.   Having regard to these considera-tions, we think  that the &quot; long range &quot; problem for corn growingin  this country  (leaving aside  for  the  moment  the  immediate situation arising out of the extreme depression of prices) is a changein  the method of  cultivation.  This change might involve radicalreforms, such as a change from small to larger farms or from  smallto larger fields, the filling in of ditches, the removal of hedges, the partial  substitution of  mechanical  power for horse  and manual labour in short, a transition towards what in America is described as &apos;&apos; power farming.&apos;&apos;  Another line of advance might  be found inthe  multitude of minor adjustments  which constitute the ordinaryproblems of farm management, without any change in the structure of farms.    126.  The  plain  fact  is  that  adequate  information  is notavailable upon which  a confident  judgment can be pronounced on sotechnical and difficult a problem.  What is clear is that the reformsmust be carried out by the farmers themselves; but there is ampleroom for help  by the State.   Besearch into  farm management isbeing actively pursued at Government expense in the United Statesof  America.  In this country  comparatively  little has  been  done,though we are glad to learn that the Ministry  of Agriculture now propose to  pursue  this work on an extended scale.   We believe thatit is of the utmost importance that research into the whole  broadsubject of farm management should be pushed forward vigorously,including,  probably,  large-scale experiments and demonstrationsof different methods  of cultivation and management, and that thenecessary  assistance  and  funds   should  be  provided  by theGovernment.    127.  We have not been asked,  nor are we competent to say, indetail, how British farming should reform  its technique, but we donot believe that farming alone of the great industries of the countryis not susceptible to rationalisation.   When we turn from agriculture to other forms of industry, we see on every side the rationalisation ofproduction being urged forward as a means of  overcoming difficultiessimilar to those from which agriculture is suffering to-day. For these reasons, we cannot aocept the contention, either that reorganisation of farming practice is impossible, or that the State, by guaranteeingfarm prices, should make it unnecessary.    128.  We have shown, that the fundamental cause of the difficult period through whioh British agriculture has been going during thelast few years has been the higher oost of production oombined with  adeclining price level.  The future  progress of farming depends mainly on the future level of prices.  As we cannot predict this, we oannot give
any definite answer to the question in our terms of reference whetherthe decline in employment will continue.  But we are satisfied that much can be done by adapting farming methods  to the new con-ditions.  Individual farmers are doing this with success, even in thedepressed areas.  It  is of the utmost importance that the  Govern-ment should  continue the  help which it is already giving  so effec-tively along many lines, eg.,  research,  education, &amp;c.  This helpis  required both in  connection with  the marketing of goods  and methods  of production on  the farm.  In  particular, we urge  theimportance of economic research into methods of cultivation and farmmanagement  to suit  the  new conditions.   We  are confident that byclose co-operation between the State and farmer- much can be done toenable British agriculture to face the difficult conditions that we have described, and, while maintaining  wages at about the present level,to  maintain or increase the volume  of agricultural production.VIII. IS  THERE  A  CASE  FOR  SUBSIDIES  OR  OTHER      ABNORMAL METHODS OF HELP  TO AGRICULTURE ?                   (a.)  Permanent Assistance.    129.  It remains for us to consider whether, in addition to what may  be  called the  normal  help given  by  the  Government  to agriculture  through the  Departments  of  Agriculture, there is  acase for  abnormal forms of  assistance, that  is to say,  for some government action which would, in  effect, either  secure  to  the farmer  prices  above  the   world level  or  otherwise  maintainuneconomic  production.   In the  first  place  we  should  pointout  the  danger   of   any  permanent  policy   of  subsidies   orguaranteed   prices.    Apart  from   the   public   burden  theyimpose, there is the  fundamental objection  that such action tends to increase over-production and to stereotype existing practice;  the farmers&apos;  motive for departing from  tradition, for seeking  a newtechnique which conforms to the  new conditions, is removed, and progress in farm management is consequently  checked.   130.   It should, in our opinion, be a cardinal principle of agricul-tural policy, that it is the first business of a farmer to make his farmpay in the existing  conditions of world markets, and measures adoptedby the State should promote and not retard economic progress  infarming.   131. Secondly,  we  would   emphasise  the  fact  that  otherunsheltered industries are suffering from depression, in some caseseven more  severe than that of farming.  It is generally agreed that.the business of those industries is to rationalise  themselves by adopt-ing more efficient  methods of production and sale.  We believe  thesame  applies to farming.    132.  We believe,  therefore,  that if  the right methods  are adopted there is a reasonable prospect  that corn-growing can bemade to pay in  this country  and that  in other directions thebusiness  of the farmer  can  be  expanded.   This must, of course,depend on the future movement of world prices, which cannot be predicted, but we think  that it is of the first importance that a greateffort should be made by British farmers to  meet the new  world situation by better management  and organisation.   133.  There is not, in our judgment, sufficient substance in anyof the arguments  which rest on the superior health and vitality ofthe rural  population  or on  the  importance of agriculture to thenational  defence,  to  warrant such a  discrimination.    134.  We are convinced that permanent  Government assistancein the form of guaranteed prices or acreage  subsidies, whioh wouldmake it easier to continue obsolete methods  should not be given.  any assistance  accorded should be directed to furthering the adoption of improved methods of production  and distribution.
                   (b.) Temporary Assistance.    135.   We have given careful consideration to the question whetherthe State would  be  justified in adopting some temporary  measureof assistance to agriculture, such as a subsidy or protection, to meetthe present  emergency.   So  far  as  the greater part  of  british agriculture  is  concerned, we  are satisfied  that no such  step  isnecessary.  There is, however, a very serious depression, which hascontinued  for  some  years,  in about  one-tenth  of the  industry,which depends mainly on the growing of corn, and the recent rapidfall in corn prices has accentuated the severity of this depression.As we have implied above, we do not believe that the correct remedy for this situation is a return to the days of low wages; but it mustbe recognised that, if these low  corn prices  continue and no  other action is taken,  there  is a serious danger that  considerable  areasof land will go out of cultivation.  This can probably be prevented by the adoption  of new methods of farming aiming at the highestproduction per man.   Such a  change of methods would  take  someyears to carry through on a great scale.   136.  But before any  practical conclusion can be  drawn, it  isnecessary to bear in mind two important considerations.   In thefirst place, it is very  difficult to ensure that  measures of assistance which are temporary in intention will  not prove  permanent infact.   In the  second  place,  as  we have endeavoured to  show,agriculture, or corn-growing, is  by no means alone in  having to face  an extremely difficult situation;  its misfortunes are common to a  large range of  unsheltered occupations.   Having  regard tothese two considerations, we cannot recommend a policy which would place  agriculture on  a peculiar  footing and extend  to it  state assistance which was denied to other  depressed basic industries.   137.  It would be another matter if  there were an  imminent danger of the general abandonment of the greater part  of the culti-vated land to poor grazings, an event which  we should regard as anational disaster.   Some  of us  are not satisfied that the presentdepression has become so acute as to justify the immediate adoptionof emergency measures of relief.  Others, however, hold that certain districts have already reached  a  crisis.    All  of us are agreed that special relief, if any, should  not  take the form of an unconditionalgrant to the  farmers,  but should  be  given   in such a way as toencourage re-organisation and the adaptation  of farming methods tothe new relation between wages and prices.      (c.) Claim to assistance in relation to other industries.   138.   We hold not less  strongly that,  if exceptional  measures,whether  permanent  or temporary,  involving a departure from our traditional economic policy, should be contemplated for the assistanceof other industries, agriculture has at least as strong a claim as anyother.[21261 ]F
                  IX.-SUMMARY  OF PRINCIPAL  CONCLUSIONS.               139.   We summarise our principal conclusions as follows :-               (i) There has been no decline in the total volume of the outputoutput? 0    of agriculture in  Great Britain between the  pre-war and post-war            period.               Such decline as has occurred has been most marked in farm crops            and livestock, but it  has  been offset by increases mainly  in dairy            produce, poultry and eggs.Acreage.   (ii)  The arable area expanded  between 1908  and 1918 by  over1,000,000 acres, but contracted  between 1918  and 1929 by  nearly3,000,000 acres.               (iii)  Agricultural employment has shown a continuous decline forcultural em-  nearly sixty years.  Since 1921, there has been a loss of employmentployment.    of about 108,000 men and women.Extent and character ofthe presentdepression.Causes ofthe presentdepression.Causes ofthe specialdecline inthe prices of arable crops.    (iv) Serious agricultural depression to-day only affects part ofthe country and some branches of farming.   More than half  thecountry is in a  satisfactory or fairly satisfactory condition, and  thearea in which there is severe depression amounts to about one-tenth of the whole.    Conditions on the farms have been, generally,  worse the higherthe proportion of income derived from the sale of cereals.  The valueof the total cereals sold off farms in Great Britain  amounts to 9  percent.,  and wheat  to $ per cent.,  of the total agricultural  output.Conditions are particularly bad on farms situated in East Anglia opheavy  clay or on infertile light land, which  will not grow good per-manent grass.    (v) The outstanding general  cause of the present agriculturaldepression has been the general fall in prices since the autumn of1920.  The prices of cereals have fallen  faster than agricultural price as a whole, particularly in recent months.    The average level of wages in England and Wales rose in 1925,after the passing of the Agricultural Wages  (Regulation) Act, 1924,and has remained practically stationary since that date.   There  hasalso been  a rise  in wages in Scotland.    Wages are a large item in farming costs, varying from 30 per cent.to $0 per  cent, in arable farming and in intensive dairying, down to20 per  cent, or less in other branches. Arable farming has, therefore,suffered more than any other types of farming by reason of the rise in wages, at  a time when prices were falling.    (vi) The  &quot;dumping&quot;  of  wheat  by Germany  and other conti-nental  countries has been a relatively unimportant factor  in depres-sing its price  during the years under review.  The action of european countries in progressively raising their tariffs against the importationof wheat has been a more serious factor.    The main cause of the exceptional fall in the price of wheat is tobe found in the progressive increase in recent years of the world area under cultivation and in the record harvest of 1928.    The &quot;dumping &quot; of oats has been  more extensive than th?.t ofwheat, but the fall in the price of oats (and in that of barley) has been largely due to the influence on the  market of wheat supplies  and feeding stuffs which are to some extent  alternatives.comparison of positionof agricul-ture withthat of otherunshelteredindustriesand theaffect ofimports onthe foreign exchange.   (vii)  From  the economic standpoint,  the problem of agriculture is  part of the larger problem of the depression of the unshelteredindustries, and  there is no clear  &quot; economic &quot; ground for singling outagriculture,  as  a whole, as a peculiarly strong claimant for special assistance.   For the  sake of the foreign exchanges,  there  would  be  some advantage in reducing the volume of imports  and thus making thebalance of trade less unfavourable, but agriculture  can put forward
no claim for assistance on these grounds that cannot be put forward with  equal force by manufacturing industries which are  exposed toforeign competition in the home market.   (viii) There are undoubted advantages to the general health ofthe nation in maintaining an agricultural population, but since lessthan 7 per cent, of the occupied population is engaged in agriculture,this advantage, when spread over the whole country, is slight.  no special State assistance to agriculture would be justified for reasons of national health.   Special measures of  assistance to agriculture,  as  an  insurance against difficulties  in the event of  war,  would  not be justified inpresent conditions.   There  are three objects to which a national agricultural  policy might be directed:  high wages, high employment, high  volume ofproduction.   The enactment of the Agricultural Wages (Regulation)Act of 1924 was a definite decision on the part of the country to adopta policy of higher wages than in the past.  As a result of this Act.money wages were  increased in England and Wales and have  sinceremained more or less stationary.  The decrease in  retail prices has,therefore, meant a steady rise of real wages.   But the  policies of  higher wages and  high  employment  aremutually conflicting.   Higher  wages reduce employment both  bycausing arable land to be put down to grass, and  by encouraging  theuse of labour-saving methods.   To sum up,  output has been  main-tained since 1908, but employment has declined by 11 per cent.   What is important from the national point of view is the mainten-ance of a high volume of agricultural production and of good  wagesand of a national agricultural industry sufficiently  profitable to paythem.   We hold that the wage policy adopted by the Government isthe right one, and the steps inevitably taken by the farmers to meetthe situation so created by employing fewer men are also right.  Thereduction  in employment which, for these reasons,  has  taken  place,must  therefore be regarded as inevitable.Nationalimportanceof agricul-ture.    (ix) Since the War, it has been generally realised that organisedmarketing in agriculture is of the first importance, and  that it is afield in which State help and guidance is particularly valuable.  Itcannot be expected that the reform  of marketing can be effected soquickly as to provide a remedy for  the immediate situation.   But,taking a long view, it is clear that radical changes in our marketingsystem are needed, that the ultra-individualistic marketing methodsof the  farmer must be drastically changed,  and  that successfuldevelopment on these lines would bring advantages of great and far-reaching importance to British agriculture.   There are certain forms of the farming business which are indepen-dent of the cultivation of the land, and  are, therefore,  capable  of an expansion which is not limited by the amount of land available.  Theproduction of  pigs, for example,  resembles a manufacturing process by which materials like barley-meal  and milling offals  are  converted into meat   The  production  of eggs and  poultry  is a process of asimilar kind.   The value  of  imported  pig-products  amounts to 60,000,000 per annum and poultry-products  25,000,000.   Much ofthis might be captured by improved production and marketing.   We have not entered into a general discussion on the importanceof small holdings in agricultural economy; but we are agreed that theydo not provide a remedy for the depression prevailing in  the distressed areas.  The value of family farms and their capacity of resistance tofalling prices depends  on the willingness of their occupiers to give their labour below the current rates of pay.  The social value of familyfarms is, however, great.  Amongst  other things, they afford oppor-tunities of  recruitment to the  farming  business,  but  they  mustmaintain themselves by taking advantage of the specialised industrieslike pig and poultry keeping, or  vegetable growing rather than the cultivation of staple crops.Extent towhich theposition ofBritishagriculture-can be improved bynormalmethods.(a)  Mar-ketingReform.(b) Generalimprove-ments infarmingpractice.
   During the fall in prices, the main change in practice adopted by farmers has been the laying down of arable land to grass.  Physical conditions,  however, place a limit upon the land which can be con- verted from arable to good pasture. The right course for land of this kind lies in the continuation of arable cultivation and at present, at all events, corn must be the mainstay over most of the area.   The British farming system, which has had as its technical objec- tive high production per acre, has, during the last half century, come increasingly into competition with the systems in overseas countries, which have as their objective, high production per man.   The technique  of the nineteenth century built up upon cheap labour must give place to a new technique.  Farmers in Great Britain to-day must face the conditions which farmers in some of the great overseas producing countries had to face in the past.   Having regard to these considerations, the &quot; long range &quot; problem for corn growing in this country, as apart from the improvement of marketing, is a change  in the method of cultivation.   We have not been asked, nor are we  competent to say,  in detail, how British farming should reform its technique, but we do not believe that  farming  alone of  the  great industries  of  the country  is  not susceptible  to rationalisation.  When we turn from agriculture to other forms of industry, we  see on every side the rationalisation of production being urged  forward as a means of overcoming difficulties. similar to those from which agriculture is suffering to-day.  For these reasons we cannot accept the contention, either that re-organisation of farming practice is impossible, or that the State,  by  guaranteeingfarm prices, should make it unnecessary.   We are  satisfied that much can  be  done by adapting farmingmethods to  the new conditions.  Individual farmers are doing  this with success even in the depressed areas.  It is of the utmost import-anoe  that the Government should continue the help  which it isalready giving, especially in the  furtherance of economic research into methods of cultivation and farm management.(c) Thespecialpositionof cerealfarming.Is there acase forsubsidies orother ab-normalmethods of help to agri-culture ?(a) Per-manentassistance.(b) Tempo-rary assist-ance.    It should, in our opinion, be a cardinal principle ofagricultural policy that it is the first business of a farmerto make his farm pay in the existing conditions of world markets, and measures  adopted  by  the  State shouldpromote and not retard economic progress in farming.    Secondly, we  would  emphasise  the fact that  otherunsheltered industries  are suffering from  depression, insome cases  even more  severe than  that of farming.    We   are   convinced  that  permanent  government assistance in the form of guaranteed  prices  or acreagesubsidies,  which  would  make  it  easier to  continueobsolete  methods,  should not  be given.  Any assistanceaccorded should be  directed to  furthering the  adoptionof improved methods of production and distribution.    We cannot recommend a policy which would placeagriculture  on a peculiar footing and extend to it state assistance  which  is denied  to  other  depressed  basic industries.  It would be another matter if there were animminent danger  of the  general  abandonment  of thegreater part of the cultivated  land  to poor grazings, an event which we  should regard  as  a national  disaster.Some of  us are not satisfied that the present depressionhas  become  so  acute  as  to  justify  the  immediateadoption of  emergency  measures  of  relief.   Others,however, hold that certain districts have already reached a crisis.  All of us are agreed that  special relief, if any,should  not take  the form of an unconditional grant  to
the farmers, but should be given  in such a  way as toencourage re-organisation and the adaptation of farmingmethods to the new relation between wages and prices.   We  hold  not  less  strongly  that,  if  exceptional (c) claimmeasures, whether permanent or temporary,  involving a ancelndeparture from our traditional economic policy,  should relationbe contemplated for the assistance of other  industries, Industries.agriculture has at least as strong a claim as any other.(Signed)     E.

Mr. Beard had to leave England on the 30th June, but before doing so he wrote a letter  of which the following is an extract:       &apos;&apos; I am  satisfied that the present depression has  become   acute  enough to  justify the adoption of  emergency  measures   of  relief, and that there are sufficient grounds for singling out   agriculture  to receive exceptional  measures  of  relief without   any reference to other depressed industries, and this regardless   as  to  whether  such  measures involve a departure from  our   traditional  economic policy.&quot;   2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,          July 7, 1930.
