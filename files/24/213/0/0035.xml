imperial         THE COMMITTEE had before  them a  Note by  the  Secretary, cabinet and Economic (LE.C. (30)  2), covering a Memorandum by the Inter-Departmental  CommitteeConference,   on Economic Questions  regarding certain suggestions for a provisional AgendaCommittee!07  fQr tne Conference which had been circulated to the Committee by direction ofEoonomic    the Prime Minister.Questions:        Tn the course of a general discussion as to the future  economic policy of telegram to   the Empire,  reference was  made to a certain  important foreign development*onomurions which made it more  than ever necessary that the whole problem should be fully          and frankly  discussed with the Dominion Representatives at the forthcoming          Conference.   There  was  a  tendency for certain Dominions to  conduct  their          economic policy without due regard to, and  on occasion in  conflict with,  their          political position in the  Empire. The advantages of the activities of the Empire          Marketing Board and the Imperial Economic  Committee, accrued in the  main          to the Dominions which  in varying degrees are attracted by the idea of becoming          self-supporting in the future.              In this connection the Committee were informed that the Government must          expect a strong demand from  British industry for closer economic co-operation          in  future between this country and the Dominions. This would probably take          the form of a request for an inquiry with a view to an agreement on the allocation          of what should be produced in  Great Britain and what in the Dominions.              It  was  generally agreed  that  while the greatest  care  would have  to be          exercised in raising fundamental questions of economic policy at the Conference,          if the susceptibilities of the Dominions are not to&apos; be offended, it was necessary          that the Dominions should be given an early intimation that it was proposed to          discuss matters such  as the effects of preference, cartels,  &amp;c, at  the Conference,          so that they  might come prepared for such discussion.              THE COMMITTEE  agreeoV-              (1) To approve the Draft  Telegram to the Dominions and India attached to                    TEG.  (30) 2, subject to the following alterations :,                     (1) Paragraph 1, line 6,  the substitution of &quot; shall&quot; for &quot; may,&quot; and                           the  deletion  of &quot;or modifications.&quot;                    (2) Paragraph 1  (1), line 2, the insertion after &quot; therefrom &quot; of the                           words  &quot; including the effect of preference, cartels, &amp;c.&quot;                    (3) Paragraph 1  (1), lines  5  and 6, the deletion of 11 (3)  any other                           matters  arising on  inter-imperial trade.&quot;                    (4) Last  paragraph  at  end add  &quot; and  would  be  glad  to  have                           memoranda from you for this purpose.&quot;                               For the  Telegram as  approved  by the  Committee, see                                   Appendix A.  (See,  however,  Note and Appendix B                                   below.)              (2) To authorise  (a) the Secretary of State for the  Dominions to send the                    Telegram forthwith to each of the Dominions, and (b)  the Secretary                    of State for India to send the Telegram to the Government of India                    accompanied  by a separate message asking in effect that  it may be                    applied to the special circumstances  of  India.              (3) In connection with  the considerations  referred  to in the earlier para-                    graphs of these minutes, to request the Treasury, Board of  Trade and                    Dominions Office  to prepare for the  consideration of the  Committee                    a  draft questionnaire for  despatch,  if  approved, to the  Dominions                    and  India, directed to  obtaining the  latest statistical  and other                    information  available  respecting  industrial production  in  those                    countries.              NOTE. After the Meeting, the  wording of the draft Telegram was further          considered by the Secretary  of State  for Dominion Affairs and the  Chancellor          of  the Exchequer.  As a result of this  reconsideration certain amendments were    &apos;      incorporated  in a revised draft of  the Telegram which was submitted to and          approved by the Prime  Minister.  For the draft Telegram in its final form see          Appendix B.  Changes  in  the draft  as  approved  by the  Committee  are          underlined.       *2.

(30) 3)and Economic  of the Foreign Policy and Defence Sub-Committee dealing with the preparationconference,   0f  Memoranda  on  Foreign  Policy  and Defence and the  Agenda  for  the1930. Polioy  r-i  .a                                                         acommittee.   Conference.              2.   At the request of the Prime Minister,  Sir Maurice Hankey  outlined          the procedure which had been followed  at previous Imperial Conferences.  The          practice had been for the British  Delegation to  consist of the Prime Minister          and three or four of his colleagues in the Cabinet, other Ministers  being added          as required for particular subjects.  The Prime Minister presided at all Plenary          Meetings of the  Conference.   In the  case of important Committees, the Chair          was taken  by  a Cabinet  Minister for example, the  Secretary of  State  for          Dominion Affairs or the President of the Board of Trade in 1926 Lord Balfour          had presided over the Committee on Inter-Imperial Relations.              The  understanding  had  always been  that Imperial  Conferences were          conferences between Governments.  Representation had accordingly been confined          to Ministers; to appoint as one of the British Representatives some person other          than  a  responsible Minister would give rise  to obvious difficulties.             3.  The Committee examined the  Interim Report and reached the following          conclusions  in regard  to various recommendations and  suggestions  set  out          therein  :- (a)  Defence Situation as a whole.    4.  THE COMMITTEE adopted the Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendation :-         That, as in 1926, the Defence Situation as a whole should be dealt with    by means of statements to the Conference by the Chairmen of the Committee    of Imperial Defence and of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, and that the    Chiefs of Staff Annual  Review  should not  be circulated to the Dominions    prior to the Conference,but reserved for consideration at a later stage the  question of communicating this review to the Dominion Prime Ministers for their personal information after their arrival  in England.(b)  Detailed Defence Questions.    5.  The Committee agreed          That the proposed Memorandum No. (ii), &quot; The situation as regards the    development of the Singapore Naval Base,&quot;  should be held up pending the    decision  to be  taken by the Cabinet on the recommendations  to be made    respecting  the future of  the Base by the Fighting Services Committee.         The remaining Memoranda numbered (i), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) to    be submitted, when ready, to the  Committee  for consideration.  In certain    cases the Committee might decide to draw the special attention of the Cabinet    to the Memoranda before their despatch to the Dominions and India.    6.  THE  COMMITTEE agreed  with  the  Sub-Committee&apos;s  recommen-dation :          That it is neither necessary nor desirable that papers on  the subjects    named in paragraph 5 of the Interim Report, viz. :       (i) Extra-Territoriality (for the purpose of internal discipline) of United           Kingdom forces in the Dominions and vice versd;     (ii) Facilities  required  from the Civil Authorities  in  the Dominions for           United Kingdom forces and vice versd;    (iii) Naval Prize Law and Prize Courts;should be sent to the Dominions prior to  the assembly of the Conference.Preparation ofMemorandaon ForeignPolioy and defence.(c) Foreign Policy.    7.   THE  COMMITTEE agreed  with the recommendations  of  the Sub-Committee :     (1)  That Foreign Policy should be dealt with, as in 1926, by means of a state-          ment to the Conference by the Secretrary of State for Foreign Affairs;          and
    (2)  That the Review of Foreign Affairs, to be prepared by the Foreign Office          as a basis for the Chiefs of  Staff Annual Review,  should  not be          circulated to Dominion Representatives, at any rate, until after their          arrival in England.    THE PRIME MINISTER  agreed that  the constitutional question of theposition of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs vis-a-vis the Dominions in negotiations with  foreign Powers could best be  considered in connection with paragraph 12 (1)  (C) of the Interim Report (see paragraph 8 (c) below).    8.  Some discussion took place in  regard to the questions affecting Inter- fof^Imperial Relations mentioned in paragraph 12 of the Interim Report.          c^nferenoe.    (a)  The Committee were reminded by Sir E. J. Harding that in the autumn of 1929  the  British  representatives  at the Conference  on the  Operation ofDominion Legislation (Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Attorney-General) had on  all  important  occasions  obtained  Cabinet sanction  for their action.  While in  theory each Government remained free  to discuss the  Report,it would be difficult, in  the circumstances, for  the British Government to refuseto endorse the conclusions accepted by  their Representatives, though  of course this would not preclude the  suggestion  of amendments of detail.    (b)  The  Committee  were  informed that  another  Sub-Committee  was preparing  memoranda  on   the  questions named  in  paragraph 12  (1) (&amp;),&quot; Nationality and  the Proposed Tribunal  for the Settlement of Disputes.&quot;  TheCommittee agreed that  these Memoranda  must  be submitted  to  them forconsideration and possible reference  to the Cabinet, before circulation to theDominions and India (if circulation were proposed).    (c)  Sir  E. J. Harding  explained to the  Committee the  arrangementsreached at the Imperial Conference of  1926 regarding the procedure governing the general  conduct of foreign policy.   A Government of  the Empire  contem-plating  negotiation of a Treaty with a foreign Government must inform the other interested Empire Governments which  should promptly indicate their attitude.In the absence of adverse comment, and  provided its policy involves no activeobligations on the part of  the other Governments, the initiating Government mayproceed on  the assumption that  its  policy is generally  acceptable.   It must,however, before taking steps which might involve the other Governments in activeobligations, obtain their definite assent.    THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the serious difficulties arisingfrom  the present  arrangements, under which the Secretary of State for  ForeignAffairs  undertakes the whole  burden  and responsibility of negotiating withForeign Powers  and yet can only speak for certainty for the United Kingdom.He instanced difficulties which had arisen during the recent Naval Conference,and the position  of the Dominions vis-a-vis the  present Egyptian negotiations.It would be  very  desirable at the forthcoming Conference  to discuss the whole matter on the basis of emphasising unity rather than disunity, and of securingfor Great Britain that equality of status which, in the  events which have happened, she no  longer possesses in practice.    THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY  instanced as an example  of failure  to consult, the recent decision of the Government of the  Commonwealthof Australia to put some vessels of  the Australian  Navy out of  commission,  asa measure of economy.    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR mentioned that, though he hadreceived no  official information  as to the  intentions of the Australian  Govern-ment, he had heard through private channels that, owing to the acute financial stringency in Australia, there was some doubt as to her  being in  a position  tocontribute to the projected extension of  the Indian air service to Australia.  the uncertainty was regrettable, in view of the recent action of the  Government  ofthe Union of South Africa in agreeing to make a substantial contribution  towardsthe Cape to  Cairo service.    THE COMMITTEE agreed that probably the best procedure would be forthe Prime Minister to mention the question in general terms in his opening speech at the Conference, and for arrangements to be made for the subject to be discussed at meetings attended only by the Heads of Delegations.
DraftTelegramsto theDominion!!and India.    THE PRIME  MINISTER gave instructions that a Memorandum for hisuse should be prepared setting out the Naval Conference and other recent cases which had given rise to difficulty and embarrassment.    It was also agreed that a  Memorandum on the recent questions affecting theappointment of  Governors-General should be circulated to the Committee forconsideration, but that no special reference to this question should  be made inthe telegrams to be sent to the Dominions.    9.  THE COMMITTEE  approved the draft Telegrams to the Dominionsset out in Appendices A and B  to the Interim Report, and agreed     (a) That these telegrams  should be despatched to  the Dominions as soon as          possible, and that copies should be sent to India; and    (b) That after the telegrams have been despatched, the Dominion Govern-          ments should be approached semi-officially on the subject of including          in  their  Delegations officials qualified to  discuss Supply and  War          Book arrangements.    At the  conclusion of  the meeting the PRIME  MINISTER emphasised theimportance of ensuring that at the Imperial Conference and at  meetings held inconnection with  it (such as the detailed discussions on Defence held in 1926 atthe Admiralty, War Office and Air  Ministry), the opinions expressed  by therepresentatives of the United Kingdom should represent the  considered viewsof the Government and not departmental opinions.  He invited  his colleagues toconfer with  him, should necessity arise, as to the best method of securing this end.2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,       May 8, 1930.o

THE COMMITTEE had before them a Note by the Secretaries (Paper,No. I.E.C. (30)  12) covering the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committeeon Economic Subjects together with certain draft Telegrams proposed to be sentto the Dominions and  India.    2.  THE COMMITTEE  approved  the  draft  Telegrams  subject to  thefollowing modifications :     Draft Telegram &quot; A  &quot;  (Appendix C). Paragraph  (1) : The last two lines         to be amended to read :            &quot; suggest  that  the  heading under which  this subject should  be             discussed might read &apos; effect of increased foreign tariffs &apos; should be             substituted.&quot;Report of theInter-Depart-mental Com-mittee onInter-imperial relations.Draft Telegram &quot; B &quot; (Appendix C).-    read as follows : -The first paragraph to be amended to           1&apos; Your telegram of 30th of April, No. 70,  is being repeated to the             other Dominions. Subjects suggested are of a technical character             and would require detailed examination by experts, but we should             welcome discussion at Conference.&quot;    3.  THE COMMITTEE  approved the proposals set out in paragraphs 3,4 and 5 of the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report relative to the  scale ofcirculation of  the  Telegrams and authorised  the  despatch forthwith  to  theDominions and India of the Telegrams in the form approved by the Committee.    4.  THE  COMMITTEE invited  the  Inter-Departmental Committee  onEconomic Questions to circulate for information in due course a complete list of theeconomic subjects to be placed  on the Agenda for the Conference.  In this connec-tion the Prime Minister emphasized the importance of it being clearly understoodthat the question of &apos;&apos; oversea settlement&apos;&apos;  would comprise  every aspect of theproblem of Inter-Imperial movement of population and  that in drafting the finaleconomic Agenda the reference to Oversea Settlement should be wide enough tocover this point.    5.  THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR DOMINION  AFFAIRS drew attention to a Question to  be  asked in  the  House  of  Commons  inquiringwhether, having  regard to the value of securing continuity  of policy at theImperial Conference, the Government would consider the question of including in the United Kingdom Delegation representatives of the other political  Parties.    He reminded the Committee  that in 1926 his predecessor had replied to asimilar question by pointing out that the Dominions did not regard the proposal with  favour, and that in these circumstances  the  Government considered theproposal to be  impracticable.    He (MR.  THOMAS) proposed to reply on this occasion  that the present government were disposed to regard the proposal favourably, but for the reasons give by Mr.  Amery  in 1926   they  thought that it  was  impracticable  ofattainment:     THE COMMITTEE agreed-         To request the Secretary of State  for Dominion  Affairs  to raise the         matter at the meeting of  the Cabinet on the 24th June, 1930.    6.  THE COMMITTEE  had before them a Note by the Secretaries (PaperNo. I.E.C.

In the course of a discussion regarding their future procedure the Committeewere informed that the Inter-Departmental Committee hoped to be in a positionto submit to the Committee,  at the end  of the present week, Memoranda onNationality and Advice to the Crown on Dominion matters.  The question as tothe procedure in relation to the appointment of Counsellors of State  was beingconsidered  by a legal Sub-Committee, and  the Memorandum would not be ready for submission to the Policy Committee for some little time.    THE PRIME MINISTER emphasised the necessity of reaching conclusions on the many intricate  questions  raised in the Inter-Departmental  Committee&apos;sReport before the Recess.    THE COMMITTEE agreed-    (1)  To hold their next meeting at No. 10, Downing Street, S.W., on Monday,           the 30th June, 1930, at 10 A.M.

(30)9A (paragraph32).I.E.C. (30)9A (paragraph     1.   THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR  DOMINION AFFAIRS  drew attention to a Question to be addressed to the Prime Minister by Sir Oswald Mosley inquiring whether an opportunity would be provided before the end of the Session for a discussion of the proposals which the Government will lay before the Imperial Economic  Conference,  irrespective  of   such   proposals  involving  legislation. Mr.  Thomas pointed out  that the  precedents  were against acceptance of  the suggestion, any such debate in  Parliament before the  Conference met must  be prejudicial to discussion at the Conference.     [NOTE. The answers given to this question are shown in the following extract from &quot; Hansard &quot;  (June 30) :-         THE PRIME  MINISTER : It has already been  explained to the House that     the  Agenda of the Imperial Conference is a  matter to be  settled in consultation     with His Majesty&apos;s Governments  in the Dominions, and this consultation is still     proceeding. I shall hope to be in a position to give the House an outline of tJhe     Agenda both on the political and the economic side  before the end of the Session.     If there be  a desire to discuss the  matter it can be raised on Supply according to     previous custom, or on  the Appropriation Bill.         MR.  REMER :  In  Committee  of  Supply  are  we  not prohibited  from     discussing a large number of cases which must arise at the Imperial Conference 1         THE PRIME MINISTER : That is so.  In Supply, the  Question can only  be     raised partially, but not in the other case.]     2.   THE COMMITTEE  had  before them the  First Report of the  Inter- Departmental  Committee  on   Inter-Imperial  Relations  (Paper  TEG. (30)  9) covering Memoranda Nos. II to VI inclusive named in  paragraph 6 of that Report, and also Memorandum No. I (Report  on the suggested  Tribunal for the Determina- tion of Disputes) (Paper I.E.C. (30) 9A).     3.   THE PRIME MINISTER  pointed out that, while the  questions  dealt with in the documents were of such a highly technical nature that discussion in detail would be difficult, issues of the greatest importance were raised, the responsibility for the decision of which must rest with Ministers.   On the present  occasion the Committee  would  consider the  substance of  the proposals leaving  for  later determination the question  of the procedure to be adopted at the  Conference with regard to the question.     4.  THE COMMITTEE considered Memorandum No. II  [inter se Applicationof  Multilateral  Governmental  Agreements,  attached to  I.E.C.  (30)  9).   Early in  the discussion  it was  pointed out  that,  as stated  in paragraph 12  of theMemorandum, the prospects of securing an agreement  of the  kind contemplated  in paragraph 11 &quot;must depend to a considerable extent  upon whether the  Imperial Conference accepts  the general  idea  of the establishment of  a Tribunal for thesettlement of disputes between the members of the British Commonwealth.&quot;  It was accordingly agreed to examine  forthwith the  Memorandum on  the  suggestedTribunal (I.E.C. (30) 9A).     5.  THE COMMITTEE considered the Report on the Suggested Tribunal forthe Determination of Disputes  (LEG. (30) 9A)  which has  been  prepared  as  a&quot; Brief &quot; for Ministers and not  for circulation to the Dominions and India.     6.  Considerable discussion took place, in the course of which explanations of points arising on the Report were given by the Lord Chancellor, the Attorney-General,  Sir C. Schuster and Sir M. Gwyer.     In particular, the following conclusions were reached with regard to  the  moreimportant suggestions and recommendations contained in the  Report.     (a) The Committee accepted the view that it would seem          &quot; impossible to anticipate that the jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee           can be retained much longer in its present form, at any  rate as regards           appeals in private litigation from all or some of the Dominions.&quot;     (b) The Committee also agreed that          &quot; it would seem useless to attempt to reach a  solution on the basis of           setting up a new Imperial Court to take over all the present functions of
            the Judicial Committee,  and  it  would  seem  best  to  concentrate  on            establishing a new Tribunal for  the  settlement of  inter-governmental            disputes, leaving the Judicial Committee to exercise its present jurisdic-            tion  in  relation to India  and the  Colonies, and  such  jurisdiction in            relation to the Dominions  as  may be left  to  it in the  case  of each            Dominion.&quot;     (c)  As regards the Constitution of the Tribunal, the Committee  preferred the Constitution            Arbitration Tribunal to the Permanent Court, and accordingly adopted i^c^o)1-            the following conclusions in paragraph 48 of the Report:             9A (Para-                                                                                 graphs 42-                (b)  &quot;48. If it should prove impossible to secure the adoption of the 53)-            principle of a Permanent  Court,  recourse must be  had to an  ad hoc            Tribunal for particular cases based upon the system of an arbitration            panel.&quot;                (c)  &quot;Each  member of the  Commonwealth  should  be asked  to            nominate as members of the panel a fixed number of persons possessing            qualifications similar to those indicated above for Judges of a Permanent            Court or other special qualifications.   The persons  so nominated should            remain on the panel for a fixed period,  say, five years,  but should be            eligible  for re-appointment  up to  a fixed age  limit;  provision must,            however, be made  whereby any person whose period of service on the            panel expires after selection as a member of the tribunal may continue            to sit until judgment is delivered.&quot;                (d)  &apos;&apos; The Clerk of the Crown in London for the time being would           be an appropriate person to act as secretary and convener of the tribunal.            The secretary, or some person nominated  by him with the  assent of the            Governments  concerned, would  act as  registrar of any tribunal which           might be constituted from time to  time.  The  country  in which the           tribunal  should sit would be a matter for the Governments concerned. &quot;-     (d)  The Committee adopted the following conclusions set out in paragraphs 54,           55 and 56 of the Report:                &apos;&apos; only Members  of  the British Commonwealth  should appear  as           parties,  and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal should  be limited to the           determination of disputes  of a  justiciable nature between two or more           Members &quot;..-..               &quot;The jurisdiction must cover                (i) The class of cases  which, if arising between  foreign countries,  Paragraph 55.           would come within the  scope of the Optional Clause,  in so far  as such           cases could arise as justiciable disputes between Members of the British           Commonwealth of Nations; and               (ii) disputes   arising  out   of   the  special  relationships  between           Members of the British  Commonwealth.&quot;               &quot; Provision should also be made that the  jurisdiction should  extend Paragraph 56.           to the determination of any dispute which the parties thereto might agree           to submit to the Tribunal.  If any question arises whether  jurisdiction           exists in  a particular case, the Tribunal should be empowered to decide,           subject to  the right  of  either  party to secure  the suspension of the           proceedings pending further discussion of the matter between the parties           or  at an Imperial  Conference.   Subject to any  such question, the           jurisdiction of the Tribunal would be compulsory, i.e., either party to a           dispute would be entitled to bring the other party before the Tribunal in           order that a judicial determination of the dispute should be  obtained.&quot;    7.  THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR INDIA requested that the positionof India in regard to the  proposals contained in the Report should, for the present,be reserved.    8.  At the conclusion of  the  discussion THE COMMITTEE agreed :     (1)  Subject,  as  stated  above,  to  approve  generally  the   conclusions  and           recommendations set out on pages 20 to 34 inclusive of the Report* of       * Note.

(30) 9)), relating inter se application of multilateral  governmentalAgreements.6  agreements.  This document  has been prepared as a brief for Ministers and not for          circulation to the Dominions and India.              9.   THE  COMMITTEE adopted  the view expressed  in  paragraph 8 of the          Memorandum that it would seem necessary that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the          United  Kingdom should resist the view of certain Dominion Governments that all          inter-governmental agreements apply proprio vigore between any of  His Majesty&apos;s          Governments which participate in them merely in virtue of their signature on behalf          of those Governments,  and should adopt the  position that if inter-governmental          agreements are to be applied inter-Imperially, this can only be as a result of inter-          Imperial agreement,  whether general or relating to any given Convention.              10.   THE  COMMITTEE  agreed  to  adopt  the following  conclusions  and          recommendations contained  in  paragraphs  12,  11,  14  and  18 of  Memorandum          No. II :-Paragraph 12.Paragraph 11.Paragraph 14.Paragraph 18.Prooedure inrelation toTreatiesinvolvingeither aRectificationof Frontiersor DefiniteCession of territories.    (a) &quot; that it  would  seem  advisable  that  the question  of  inter-Imperial           applicability of inter-Imperial  agreements should, if possible, not be           raised at the Imperial Conference until there has been discussion on the           question of the establishment of  an inter-Imperial Tribunal and there is           some indication as to the likelihood of the general acceptance of such an           idea.&quot;    (6) &quot; that the representatives of  His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United           Kingdom at the Imperial Conference should endeavour to secure general           agreement that the provisions of all  inter-governmental agreements will           be applied  inter-Imperially  by His Majesty&apos;s  Governments in the           different parts of the Empire on  condition of (1) a general reservation as           to provisions relating to the settlement of disputes,  and (2) agreement           upon such other special reservations as may be desired by any of His           Majesty&apos;s Governments in relation to any particular  agreement.   (Such           special reservations would  probably  only be required in the case  of  an           agreement dealing with some matter  as to which the several parts of the           Empire would wish to accord preferential treatment to one another as           compared with foreign countries.) &quot;    (c) &quot; that if more than one of the Dominions declined to participate in an agree-           ment of the nature described in paragraph 11, the only possible course           would  appear to  be to  place it clearly on record that His  Majesty&apos;s           Government in the United Kingdom do not  regard inter-governmental           agreements as applying proprio vigore as between those of His Majesty&apos;s           Governments which participate  in  them, but that they are ready to           consider in every case how far they can in practice apply the provisions           of any such agreement  into which they enter in relation to the other           Governments of His Majesty which participate  and that, in  general,           they anticipate that it will be possible so to apply all the provisions of           such agreements except those which deal with the settlement of disputes.&quot;    id) &quot; that at the  Imperial Conference every effort should be made to secure           agreement on the lines described  in paragraph 11 of this report, and that           the course described in paragraph 14 should only be adopted, in the last           resort,  if all efforts to secure such an agreement were to fail.&quot;    11.  THE COMMITTEE had before them Memorandum No. Ill attached tothe First Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Inter-Imperial Relations(LEG.

This document has beenprepared as a brief for Ministers and not for circulation to the Dominions and India.
    12.  THE  COMMITTEE  adopted  the  Inter-Departmental  Committeesrecommendation as follows :         &quot; The matters might be mentioned at the Imperial Conference, in the course    of any discussion on treaty procedure, and the principles  set out in the    Memorandum might be recommended for general adoption in the case of all    treaties of the kind now in question.&quot;    13.  THE COMMITTEE considered  Memorandum  No. IV attached to the Channels ofEirst  Report  of  the  Inter-Departmental Committee on  Inter-Imperial Relations ^&quot;&quot;between(I.E.C.

THE COMMITTEE adopted  the  Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s  con-clusions &quot;and recommendations as set cut  in paragraphs 10-13  inclusive of theMemorandum :         10. &quot; We therefore recommend  that, subject to  unanimous  agreement on    two main principles on which the present practice is based, a  definite list of    subjects should be laid down (including the exceptions already sanctioned) in    dealing with which it should not be necessary to use the diplomatic channel.        11. &quot; The principles, a  reaffirmation of  which by the Conference should    be sought, are-        (1) that there should be prior consultation in regard to all matters in which               more than one part of the  Empire may be in any way directly or               indirectly concerned;  and        (2) as agreed by the Imperial Conference in 1926, that in cases other  than               those  where Dominion Ministers  are accredited to  the Heads of               foreign States,  it is very desirable that the existing diplomatic               channels  should continue to be  used in  matters of general  and               political concern.        12. &quot; Subject to agreement on (1) and (a) as above, it is suggested that the    following categories of subjects should not be considered as  &apos; matters of general    and political concern,&apos; and that  they need,  therefore, not be dealt with under    the formal procedure laid down in (2) :-        The  negotiation  of  commercial  arrangements  affecting  exclusively  a    Dominion Government and  a  foreign Power.   (There have  been many cases    where Dominion  Governments  have negotiated commercial  agreements  with    foreign consular  officers in the  Dominions.)         Complimentary messages,  e.g.,  of congratulation or condolence from one    Government to another.  (It  was agreed  at the Imperial Conference, 1926, that    these might go direct from Government to  Government.)         Invitations and replies to invitations to non-political conferences.         (An  exception to the full  diplomatic channel has already been made and    Dominion Governments communicate invitations to foreign  Governments direct    to His Majesty&apos;s Representatives abroad.)         Facilities  for British  subjects belonging to the Dominions in  visiting    foreign countries.         Legalisation and certification of documents.         Extradition formalities, which will be carried out in accordance with the    terms of  the relevant treaty.         Requests for information  of a technical or scientific character, including    statistics, exchanges of official  documents or publication, sanitary, agricultural    and similar  subjects, and information regarding the drug  traffic.         [It will be realised that the Dominions which are separate members of the    League and India communicate (on League matters) direct with the Secretariat    of the League, and  in some cases are locally represented at Geneva.]         13. &quot; It is further suggested that it should be agreed that the categories     of subjects enumerated above could be dealt  with in countries where  there are    no Dominion diplomatic representatives  by  any of the  following  channels,     according to convenience or inclination of the Governments  concerned :          (1)  The less formal channel of His Majesty&apos;s Representative in  a foreign               capital,  without  transmission through the Foreign Office.
                   (2) (In appropriate cases)  consular  officials, whether British or foreign                         officers, in either of  the countries concerned.                   (3) Dominion Cabinet Ministers or officials on special missions.&quot;               15.  THE COMMITTEE had before them Memorandum No. V attached to the          First Report  of the Inter-Departmental  Committee  on Inter-Imperial Relations          (I.E.C. (30) 9) on Technical  Phraseology in Official Documents.  This document had          been prepared as a brief for Ministers and not for circulation to the Dominions and          India.               16.  THE COMMITTEE  adopted the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s recom-          mendations set out in paragraphs 3,  6 and 7 of the Memorandum :                Meaning  of the phrase &quot; Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&quot;                   &quot; Having regard, however,  to the special position of India, we think that               it would  be undesirable to  raise specifically at the Imperial Conference the               question of the precise definition of the phrase.&quot;                                    Use  of the phrase &quot;Britannic.&quot;                   &quot;  In  the circumstances we  recommend that endeavour should be made  at              the Imperial Conference to arrive at an agreement  that the term  &apos; Britannic &apos;              is not  regarded  as implying any form of subordination to Great Britain  and,              accordingly, that there is no objection to  the continued use of the phrase &apos; His              Britannic Majesty &apos; to describe the King in cases where it is not desired to quote              His  Majesty&apos;s full title.&quot;                                      Use of the word &quot;British.&quot;                   &quot;  In  the  circumstances we recommend  that  this question should  not  be              raised.  This would not, in our opinion, preclude His Majesty&apos;s Government in              the United Kingdom from endeavouring, as far  as possible, to use the adjective              as one  applying to any  part of the Empire and not confined solely  to Great              Britain, and, from this  point of view, it would be very desirable that, wherever              practicable, the phrase &apos; United  Kingdom &apos; should be employed rather than the              term &apos; British &apos; in  relation to this country, e.g., in describing the delegation from              this country at an  international conference where the Dominions are represented              by separate delegations.&quot;              18.  With  reference -to  I.E.C.  (30),  4th  Conclusions  (4)  and  (5),  THE          COMMITTEE had under further consideration Memorandum No. VI attached  to          the First Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Inter-Imperial Relations          (TEG. (30)  9).              After a short discussion THE COMMITTEE agreed-                   To defer  further consideration  of the Memorandum in  question until the                   Memorandum on Nationality Questions (LEU. (30) 17) had been considered,                   and that, in the meantime,  no part of the  Memorandum No. VI should  be                   circulated to the Dominions and India.              19.  THE COMMITTEE  were informed that  every effort would be made  to          circulate the outstanding Reports on this question with the least possible delay  and,          if possible,  not later than the evening of Friday, the 4th July.              THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL undertook to send  copies of two Memoranda,          which he had prepared  for the Prime  Minister, to Sir C. Schuster for the information          of the Legal Sub-Committee. circulation of     20.  THE COMMITTEE agreed that the High Commissioner for the Common-^oSon&apos; 6 wealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South  Africa and the Irish Free High Com-   State should receive  from the Cabinet Office, for  perusal and  return, the papers  on London6181&quot;  non-economic subjects sent out to their Governments in advance of the Conference^   * Note. This arrangement was  not made  applicable to Canada pending the arrival of the new IligtCommissioner in London.
    21.  THE COMMITTEE authorised  the  despatch forthwith to the Govern-ments of the Dominions and India of copies of the following documents in the form wwSthtfcirculated to the Committee :                                                   ^at!o,ni-.

INTER-IMPERIAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE.Memorandum No. 1 in Report of Inter-Imperial Relations Committee of June 4,1930.   REPORT ON THE SUGGESTED TRIBUNAL POR THE DETERMINATION OF DISPUTES.     1.  Before attempting to consider in detail  the problems  involved  in  theSuggestion for a  Tribunal  contained in Part VII of the Report of the Conferenceon the Operation of Dominion Legislation, of which a copy is appended, and theform which such  a Tribunal might take, it seems desirable to give some account ofthe existing position  as  regards  appeals to the Judicial Committee  of  the privy council, which is  the supreme appellate Court for all parts of the Empire other thanthe United Kingdom.                  The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.     2.  The Judicial  Committee of the Privy Council is the highest Court of appeal for the whole of the British Empire, with the exception of England,  Scotland andNorthern Ireland.  It has, however,  jurisdiction in Ecclesiastical cases in England,and  in  time of war it is the Supreme  Appeal Court in prize.   It also deals  with matters which may be specially referred to it by the King in Council under Section 4of the Judicial Committee Act, 1833.     3.  While the Judicial Committee is usually spoken of and treated as a Court,at the outset, it should be understood that the appeals which it hears are addressedto the  King in Council, by whom  they are technically  referred to the JudicialCommittee by a general Order in Council to report the result to His Majesty; andthe final Order made  on  an appeal is an Order of His Majesty in Council and not an Order of the Judicial Committee.  The Order  in Council is, however, a  formalmatter, the King  acting merely on the advice of  the Judicial Committee without inany  way considering  the merits of the  case; indeed, constitutionally, he could not do otherwise.   This  point being made clear, throughout  this memorandum theJudicial Commttee will be treated as  what it is in practice, a Court of Law.     4.  The origin of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council lies far back inconstitutional history. In theory, the King is the fountain of all justice throughouthis dominions and exercised jurisdiction through  his  Council.  In course of timethe regular Courts took  the place of the Sovereign in Council,  so  far as ordinarycases were concerned; but  long before the Colonies  were thought of,  the channel islands presented a problem of their own, and so early as  1580 the right of these islands to  present appeals to&apos; the King in Council was recognised, and there is anOrder in  Council of  that  year prescribing conditions under which  appeals  fromGuernsey may be prosecuted, which is still in operation, and forms the basis of theprovisions  which  have ever since  regulated appeals from the oversea possessions ofthe Crown.  During the  17th century the foundations of the British Colonial Empirewere laid in America and  the West  Indies, and India was also being developed bythe East India Company.  In 1667 a Committee of the Privy Council, called &quot; TheCommittee for the Business of Trade,&quot;  was established, with jurisdiction to entertainappeals from &quot;foreign  plantations&quot;  (colonies) with  the  appeals  of  the channel islands already alluded to, and in 1683, by a decision of the Courts in England, theprinciple was affirmed that an appeal lay to the King in Council from all places held under a grant from the Crown.   As the Empire expanded during  the 18th century,so the area over  which the Privy Council had jurisdiction  increased, for wherevercourts of justice were set up,  it followed as a corollary that from those courts  therewas a right of appeal to the King in Council.  In  some instances special Acts ofParliament were passed making  direct  provision  for  this right of appeal,  and in1773, for examples in an Act for the better administration of justice in India, itwas provided in  terms that appeals from the Supreme Courts set up there shouldlie to His  Majesty in Council.   The records of appeals during  the 17th, 18th and early part of the  l9th centuries are scanty, and of the constitution of the committeesthat heard them  little is known.  By an Order  in Council of 1696 it was providedthat three members should  form a quorum (a provision  which applies to the JudicialCommittee to-day), but the records seldom show  of whom the quorum consisted, andit is probable that it was often composed of laymen; at any rate, there is no provisionextant requiring the  presence of  anyone with judicial experience.   So matters went
on until the close of the Napoleonic Wars,  when, with the resumption of trade and commerce and the increasing importance of the British oversea dominions, it was-obvious that this haphazard method of administering justice was out of date, andit was  essential  that  appeals  which  were now beginning to involve  substantialinterests and important questions of law, should be heard by a definitely constitutedjudicial body.  To Lord Brougham is due the reform of 1833 which constituted theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council  in its  present form.  The JudicialCommittee Act of that year provided  that the Committee should hear  all appealswhatever  which could be brought by statute or custom before the King in council from any Court, judge or judicial officer (that is, outside the United Kingdom), andit prescribed the procedure to be followed in the conduct of these appeals.  To-day,this  Act in the main still governs the practice of the Judicial Committee, though inthe course of nearly a century many amendments to meet modern requirements andmany additional rules have  been introduced.     5.  The Act also prescribes the persons who shall compose the Court.  Briefly,.they were to be the Lord President of the Council and former Lord Presidents, theLord Chancellor and former Lord Chancellors and most of the chief judges of theland who were to sit when  their  ordinary duties permitted; but, as many additions to those persons have by amending Acts been made, it will be more useful to give an account of the persons who to-day  compose the tribunal.  The Lord President  ofthe Council is technically the head of the Judicial Committee, but, as he is usuallynot a lawyer, he takes no part in the ordinary business of the Court. At the presenttime Lord Parmoor (who  many years ago was made  a member of the JudicialCommittee) happens to be the Lord President, and he has on more than one occasionpresided over the Court. While there  are a number of judges holding other offices-who, as Privy Councillors,  are technically members  of the Judicial Committee, the panel of judges is usually drawn from the following :  the Lord Chancellor, the sevenLords of Appeal who are appointed specially to sit either in the House of Lordsor in the Judicial Committee, and certain judges of  Indian experience either on the bench or at the Bar who sit, with some of the Lords of Appeal, for the hearing ofIndian  Appeals  only.  At  the present time there are four of such judges, one  ofwhom is a Hindu.   There  are also at  the  present time nine judges of  the Courts-of the Dominions who have been made members of  the Judicial Committee; but.naturally these seldom sit  and,  of course, are not paid.  These last appointmentsare really of an  honorary character, though usually one or  other of the Canadianmembers of the Court comes and sits for about a month each year and his expensesare paid by his Government; and a judge from Australia on leave sometimes attends.Some former Lord Chancellors and retired judges sit as volunteers; but, as stated,.the  regular members are  the  Lord  Chancellor and. the seven Lords of Appeal,.assisted in Indian cases by the judges  specially appointed for the purpose.  Whenthe  Lords of Appeal are not required for  the  Judicial Committee they sit in theHouse of Lords, and, as a rule, they are divided between the two Courts, some sittingduring one legal  term at the end and the remainder  at the other, changing about if in some special case it is desirable  to  have the presence of  a judge who may be  aspecialist in that branch of the law involved in the case.  It may be convenient tostate here that the qualifications for the Lords  of Appeal are either having been  a judge of one of  the  Superior Courts or having fifteen years standing  at the Bar.::.Thev hold their offices for life and there is no retiring  age.  Two of the judges from india above referred to, who were appointed under a recent Act and receive salaries of  4,000 a year (paid partly by Great  Britain and partly by India), have to retireat 72; and this is interesting, as being  the only statutory provision hitherto for the compulsory  retirement of  judges in England.   As  has been seen,  three  are theminimum quorum of judges, but as a rule five form  the Court, which generally sitsin two Divisions, one taking Dominion and colonial cases and the other Indian.     6.   A word should be  said about appeals in criminal cases which the JudicialCommittee has jurisdiction to entertain from all Courts in the Empire.   These canonly be  brought  by  special  leave granted by the Judicial Committee itself, and itmay  be added that such leave is very rarely given, and only in cases where  there is reason to think that there  has been a  grave violation of the principles  of  naturaljustice or where  rules of procedure or evidence  have been  seriously disregarded.Applications for leave to  appeal in criminal  cases  are usually  from  India, butoccasionally from other parts of the Empire.   It will be seen that,  though rarelygranted, the right of applying to the  Judicial  Committee for leave to  appeal in criminal cases is a valuable safeguard against possible cases of injustice.      [21355]                                                         c
    7.  Three other matters referred to in the first paragraph remain to be dealtwith :  ecclesiastical appeals,  appeals in  Prize  matters,  and the  power  of  the sovereign to refer  any  matter (not being  the subject of legal proceedings) to theJudicial Committee for  advice.    8.  The origin of the jurisdiction of  the Judicial Committee in ecclesiasticalappeals dates from the Reformation, when, by  an Act  passed in the reign ofHenry VIII (1533), appeals to Rome were transferred to the King as Head of theChurch of England.  These  appeals  were dealt with by a special Commission of delegates,  whose functions were transferred to the Judicial Committee when thatCourt&apos; was instituted.  The ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee in modern times arises in the main from  provisions in the Clergy Discipline Act, 1892,and in the Union of Benefices Measure,  1923; it is practically confined to appeals from sentences of the Bishops&apos; courts depriving clergymen of their livings for moralshortcomings, and an occasional faculty appeal,  and even appeals of these classes are rare.   On the hearing of ecclesiastical appeals three to five  bishops attend asAssessors.   While  on the subject of Assessors, it may also  be  mentioned that a royal Naval and a Mercantile Marine officer sit as Assessors upon  the hearing ofmaritime appeals to advise the judges upon technical points of seamanship.    9.  Under the Naval Prize Acts appeals from the High Court in England inprize matters lies  to the Judicial Committee;   the  Judicial  Committee also hasjurisdiction under  the Act of  1833 and subsequent Acts in appeals from Overseaprize courts, i.e.,  courts  in Dominions, Colonies,  &amp;c, which have been speciallyempowered by Royal Commission and Admiralty Warrant to act  as prize courts.    10.  Of more importance is the power of the Sovereign conferred by Section 4of the Act of 1S33 to refer abstract questions to the Judicial Committee for advice,the exercise of which in modern times  shows a tendency to increase. The reference ismade on the advice of Ministers in the United Kingdom, and questions of the mostdiverse kind as to which it would have been difficult to obtain elsewhere a satisfac-tory answer carrying weight, have at different times been so referred.     11.  The following are  a few examples during the last fifteen  years or so :Whether a certain Member of Parliament had been disabled from sitting and voting in the House of Commons owing to his connexion with some Government contracts;what were the rights of the British South African Company in the lands of SouthernRhodesia;  questions arising with  reference to  the  boundary  between NorthernIreland and the Irish  Free  State under the Articles of Agreement  of December1921;  and, recently, by agreement between Canada and Newfoundland, the question as to which Dominion owns  the  vast country of  Labrador  was referred  to,  andanswered in favour of Newfoundland, by the Judicial Committee.  Cases of judges in the colonies  who have been suspended  for alleged misconduct  have also been referred in this manner to the Judicial Committee.  The decision of the JudicialCommittee in such  references has, it should be remarked, no actual force of law, butin practice it has  invariably been acted upon by  those concerned.   These specialreferences are argued, as a rule, by Counsel, in the same manner as ordinary appeals.     12.  Having  now  explained what the  Judicial  Committee  is  and  how  itfunctions  in practice, a few words may be added respecting the principal Courtsfrom which appeals lie to it,  and the conditions under which appeals from theseCourts lie.     13.   Appeals  in ordinary litigation  from  oversea  Courts reach the JudicialCommittee in three ways :           (1) as of right;         (2) by leave of the Court concerned;         (3) by special leave to appeal granted by the Judicial Committee.     14.   As regards (1) and (2), the authority for the hearing of such appeals restsin general either on an Order in Council of the  United Kingdom issued, in relation to a particular territory, under  the Act of 1844, or on  local legislation  in  such territory,  or, in some  cases, on  both.   Provision is made thereby for procedure generally, and also, as a rule, a requirement of a minimum  amount of the sum in dispute is fixed for appeals as of right.  Any alteration to the position as to appeals in these cases would require the same authority,  that is  to  say, in some cases  an Order in Council of the United Kingdom,  in other local legislation.
    15.  As regards (3), the right of the Judicial Committee to grant special leave to appeal rests on  the  prerogative;  it has been held that  the operation of thisprerogative can be  excluded  only by  express legislation of the Parliament of theUnited Kingdom.   The Constitutions of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Unionof South Africa and the Irish Free State, in providing that there shall be no appealas of right from the respective Supreme Courts to the Judicial Committee, expresslygave the power of the Judicial Committee to grant special leave to appeal.  This is subject in the case of the Commonwealth to a special limitation as to constitutional questions (see below), and  in the case of the Commonwealth and the Union to ageneral provision  empowering the respective Parliaments to pass legislation (whichmust be reserved for the Royal Assent), limiting the classes of cases in which specialleave may be granted. No such legislation has, in fact, been passed.    18.  It is unnecessary to consider in detail the position as to appeals from courts in Colonies, Protectorates,  mandated  territories, and certain foreign  territories inwhich  His Majesty  exercises jurisdiction under the Foreign Jurisdiction Acts;  butthe following is the position as to the courts in tthe Dominions and India from whichappeals come to the  Judicial Committee :     17.   The Dominion of Canada as it now exists dates from 1867, when the british north America Act was passed which constituted the then existing Provinces as a dominion and provided for the possibility for fresh Provinces to be created in thefuture, as has since been done.  There are nine such Provinces and two Territories inthe remote north administered directly by the Dominion.   Each of the Provinces has its own Courts, and from these appeal lies to  the Supreme Court of Canada or&apos; tothe Judicial Committee, at the option of the appellant;  but a further appeal fromthe Supreme Court  to the Judicial Committee can only be granted by special leave of the Judicial Committee, and the Supreme  Court itself has no power to grant suchleave.  This is an important point to note because, as  will be  readily understood, itrestricts appeals from the Dominion Supreme  Court to matters which the JudicialCommittee considers to be of real importance and so limits considerably the right ofappeal.   In practice leave to appeal from the  Supreme Court is seldom granted in private disputes unless some general principle of law is involved.  There is, however,an appeal as of right from the Supreme Court of Canada in  maritime cases, underthe operation of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act.    18.  Some  of the most  important cases coming from  the Supreme  Court aredisputes between the Dominion and its constituent Provinces as to the respectivelegislative powers of each under  the British North America Act.  A year seldompasses without several of these intricate cases of constitutional law being  consideredby the Judicial Committee.    (As regards the Dominion, see British North America Act, 1867, section 101, theCanadian Supreme  Court Act (Revised  Statutes, 1927, chapter 35),  section 54.  Asregards the Provinces, see Quebec Code of Civil Procedure, articles 68, 69, 1249-1252;Ontario  Privy  Council  Appeals Act (Revised Statutes, 1927,  chapter  86);.  other provinces,  Orders  in Council dating  mostly  from 1910;  the  latest, relating toSaskatchewan, dated the 4th June, 1918-S. R. &amp; O. No. 656 of 1918.)    19.  This Dominion consists of six States, each having, as in Canada, its ownindependent Courts, with a High  Court of Appeal for the whole Commonwealth.There is a right of appeal from the State Courts direct to the Judicial Committee orto the  High  Court,  but  no further  appeal from the latter without special leavegranted by the Judicial Committee, as in the case of the Supreme Court of Canada.There is a further limitation  of appeals from Australia which it is important to note, namely, that under the Commonwealth Act there can be  no appeal from theHigh Court to the Judicial Committee in any question as to  the limits inter se of theconstitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of any State or States, or asto the limits inter se of the constitutional power of any two or more  States, unlessCommittee to interpret the Australian constitution and, therefore,- places AustraliaDominion of Canada.Commonwealth of Australia.
in a different position from that of Canada.   It is also the only example of actuallimitation by legislation of the Royal Prerogative to admit an appeal,  though, asindicated above, the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to pass legislationlimiting the classes of cases in which special leave to appeal may be granted.  It maybe added that the certificate referred to has not yet been given in any case.     (Commonwealth of  Australia Constitution Act, 1900, constitution, sections 71-74.  As regards the  States, see the separate Orders in Council dated between  1909and 1911;  see also  Commonwealth Judiciary Act, 1903,  section  39  (2), limitingappeals in matters of federal jurisdiction.)                                 New Zealand.     20.  This is a unitary Dominion, that is, consisting of one State only.  Appealsas of right  lie to  the Judicial Committee from the Court of Appeal, subject to  a limitation as to the minimum amount at issue; appeals may also lie by leave of theCourt of Appeal or the  Supreme Court, as the case may be, in certain circumstancesset out in the United Kingdom Order in Council, which deals with the regulation ofprocedure, including the fixing of a minimum amount in dispute.     (Order in Council dated the 10th January, 1910, S. R. &amp; O. (1910) No. 70.)                            Union of South Africa.     21.  As regards its legal machinery, this Dominion differs from Canada and australia,  inasmuch as there is  one Supreme Court for the whole Union,  with separate divisions for each of its four Provinces.   An appellate division sits to hearappeals from these  provincial divisions.   There is no right of appeal direct to theJudicial Committee from the  provincial divisions; appeal from  the appellatedivision lies only by special leave granted by the Judicial Committee.   As indicated above, the Union Parliament has the  power, though this  power has not yet been exercised, to pass legislation limiting the classes of cases in which special leave may begranted. Since the date of the establishment of the Union in 1910 only six appealshave been brought.  (South Africa Act, 1900, section 106.)                                Irish Free State.     22. There is no appeal from the Supreme Court to the Judicial Committee as of right; but special leave to appeal may in  any  particular case be granted by the Judicial Committee.  Since the establishment of  the Irish Free State in 1922, thishas been done in three instances only.   (Irish Free State Constitution Act,  1922; Constitution, Article 66.)                                 New foundland.     23.  There is a Supreme Court consisting of three judges; appeals lie,  as  of right, to the Judicial Committee, subject, as usual, to a limitation as to the amount at issue.  (Newfoundland Act, 1824; Order in Council, 13th October, 1910.)                                     India.     24.  Apart from appeals brought by special leave of the Judicial Committee, appeals lie to the Judicial Committee from all Courts of final appellate  jurisdiction in British  India and  also from certain British  Courts established in the Indian States under the Foreign  Jurisdiction Act.   Some of the Courts of appellate  juris- diction are established by Letters Patent and some by  local legislation.  In  the case  of  Courts   established   by  Letters   Patent  the   right  of   appeal   is regulated   partly  by   the  Letters  Patent  and  partly  by  the  Indian  Code of  Civil  Procedure.  In the  case  of  other   Courts  it  is  regulated  entirely by the Code.  The right  of  appeal  is limited ordinarily to  cases  where  the amount or  value of the subject matter is not less than! ten thousand rupees but the Courts have power to certify that any case, whatever its value, is a fit one for appeal to the Judicial Committee.  There is also a strictly limited appeal in certain criminal cases under  certificate granted by a  High  Court established  by Letters Patent.

             The Dominion Attitude Towards the Judicial Committee.     26.   There have from time to time been indications that the Dominions were not altogether satisfied with the position in regard to appeals to the Judicial Committee. For instance, the question of an &quot; Imperial Court of Appeal &quot; was discussed at some length at the Imperial Conference  of 1911 :  and a further discussion took place at the Imperial War Conference of 1918 on a memorandum drawn up by  Mr. Hughes (then Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia).  The main point of Mr. Hughes&apos; ideas was the merger of the appellate functions of the House of Lords with those of the Judicial Committee in the establishment of a new Court  which would comprise members representative of all parts of the Empire.   It was agreed at that Conference that a scheme should be drawn up for discussion at the next  Imperial Conference; but this was allowed to lapse chiefly owing to objections urged privately from Canada.     27.   The question did not again become active until  after the establishment ofthe  Irish Free State.   The Irish  Provisional  Government had  in 1922 contestedstrongly the inclusion in  the Irish Free State  Constitution of a specific safeguardof the right of the Judicial Committee  to grant special leave to  appeal :  but such provision was eventually included (Article 66) on the insistence of United kingdom ministers.  No public discussion,  however, took place until, at the beginning of 1926,the Irish Free State took  violent exception to the action of the Judicial Committeein granting special leave  to appeal in a case arising on the Irish Free State LandAct.  They raised the question of the  position  of the Judicial  Committee at theImperial Conference held  in the autumn of that year and urged that the jurisdictionto hear appeals from Dominions  was an anomaly and out of date in regard to thepresent constitutional position and that it ought to be abolished.  After considerable discussion, agreement was reached  on the terms of the statement which appears inthe Summary of Proceedings of the Conference (Cmd. 2768, p. 19) as follows :          &quot;From these discussions it became clear that it  was no part of the policy     of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain that questions  affecting judicial     appeals should be determined otherwise than in accordance with the wishes of     the part of the Empire primarily affected.  It was,  however, generally recog-     nised that, where changes in the existing system were proposed which,  while     primarily affecting one part, raised  issues in which other parts were also con-     cerned, such changes ought only  to be carried  out after  consultation and     discussion.         &quot; So far as the work  of  the Committee was concerned, this general under-     standing expressed all  that  was required.   The question of  some immediate     change  in the present conditions governing appeals from the Irish Free  State     was not pressed in relation to the present Conference; though it was made clear     that the right was reserved to  bring up the matter again at the next Imperial     Conference for discussion in  relation to the facts of this particular case.&quot;     28.  Since then, further  public discussion  of an acrimonious character has arisen, both in  the  United Kingdom and in the Irish Free  State, over the twojudgments of the Judicial Committee in the case of the  transferred civil servants(Wigg and  Cochrane) and  also  over a  more recent copyright appeal.  It seemsunnecessary here to go in  detail into these cases, though it might be as well to add that, both in the Land Act case referred to above and the Copyright case, the IrishFree State have endeavoured by legislation, after special leave to appeal had beengranted, but before the case came  on for hearing, to render inoperative the judgment of the Judicial  Committee; and  they have indicated their intention of taking  inthe future any course which may be open to them, whether by such legislation  orotherwise,  in order to prevent  any judgment of the Judicial  Committee  from becoming operative in the Irish Free State.     29.   The question was not expressly discussed at the recent Conference on theOperation of Dominion Legislation, though incidental allusions were  made to theJudicial Committee, and  no reference to the Judicial Committee appears in theReport of the Conference (Cmd. 3479).   The view taken by the  Dominion repre-sentatives (at any rate those of  Canada, the Union  of South Africa where thequestion has little practical significance and the Irish Free State) appears to havebeen that the general recommendations of  the Conference, if carried  into effect, wouldenable them  to take such measures as they might think fit to  effect a practical abolitionof appeal by special leave in the case of  their respective Dominions.
     30.  The nature of the steps which the Dominions might take with this object in view would no doubt  vary; and  in the case of the Irish Free  State  it wouldbe necessary to consider whether any such measures are possible without a breach ofthe Articles of Agreement of the 6th December, 1921.  Moreover, the extent to whichthe Dominions would desire to modify or limit the appeal by special leave would no doubt  also  vary.   It is certain that the Irish Free  State would  wish to  get rid of it altogether.  The Union of South Africa might also wish to  do  so as a gesture.In the case of Canada, it is certain that they would wish to limit it in criminal.cases, but it is  by no means certain that they would wish to go further.     31.  Further curtailment by the Dominions of the right of appeal to the JudicialCommittee would probably give rise in India  to a demand for some similar action.Proposals have already been  made in India from time to time for the establishmentof a Supreme Court of Appeal for British India for the  disposal of civil appealsand  certain criminal cases now heard by the Judicial Committee.  But the positionof India would in any case, it is thought, need special consideration.     32.  In the light of the history as set out above it seems impossible to anticipate that the jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee can be retained much longer in itspresent form,  at any rate as regards appeals in private litigation from all or someof the Dominions.  Moreover, the Irish  Free State attitude towards the constitutionof the Judicial Committee is such as to render it reasonably certain that they wouldnot be prepared to agree to use it as a tribunal for the special reference of inter-Governmental disputes (under Section 4 of the Act of 1833).   But the existence ofa tribunal for this purpose has now become  clearly necessary,  more  particularlyhaving regard  to the reservation made on behalf  of  the United  Kingdom and  theDominions (except the Irish Free State) in accepting  the Optional Clause of  theStatute of  the Permanent  Court  of International  Justice, under which  inter-Commonwealth disputes are excluded from the jurisdiction of this Court.                   The Possibility of a New Imperial Court.    33.  From certain points of view it might be thought that the logical and most satisfactory solution of  the problem  would be  the  establishment of a new  Court to-which  all the  existing functions of  the Judicial  Committee could  be  transferred.The idea would be that such a Court would be  constituted, on a basis of equality, ofpermanent members representative of the United Kingdom, each Dominion, India,and the Colonies and  Protectorates.   In theory this solution would seem attractive,but it is feared that it would not be found practicable.  In the first place the bulk ofthe work of the Judicial Committee at present  comes  from India, and such a court would not be very appropriately constituted to deal with Indian cases.  In the second place, though  the Court might have at its disposal the best judges in the variousDominions, it is felt that they would hardly command the universal respect which isgiven to the highest standard of judicial talent in this country.  In the third place,there is reason to suppose that, to some  Dominions at  any rate, the hearing of their cases by judges from other Dominions would not be altogether acceptable.    34.  But from the Dominion point of view, there is a further objection, namely,the attitude of certain of the Dominions which is  likely to be emphatically against any Court which provides for the hearing, by an outside body, of appeals in privatelitigation.   This is the attitude which is most strongly expressed in the Irish FreeState, but it is probably also shared to  some extent in the Union of South Africa,and possibly in Canada.    35.  In the circumstances,  it would seem useless to attempt to reach a solution on this basis of setting up a new Court  to take over all the present functions of  theJudicial  Committee, and it would seem best to concentrate on establishing a newtribunal  for  the  settlement  of inter-governmental disputes, leaving  the  JudicialCommittee to exercise its present jurisdiction in relation to India and the Colonies,and such jurisdiction in relation to the Dominions as may be left to it in the case ofeach Dominion.                   Analogies from International Arbitration.    36.  On considering what would be the most satisfactory type of court for  thesettlement of inter-Imperial disputes, the only experience on  which we  can draw isthat  of the judicial settlement  of international disputes.   As regards the type of court for such disputes, it is possible to trace four stages.      [21355]                                                        D 2
    37.  The earliest method was that of referring a dispute to the decision of theHead of a third State.  In practice, this meant that the selected sovereign referred the matter to one or more lawyers of his own nationality and adopted the opinion which they gave.   According to this method, the &quot; tribunal &quot; was  purely an ad hocone, and there is the further objection that the disputants did not know who was, infact, going to decide the case; all they knew was that it would be decided by peoplepossessing a particular nationality.   Moreover, this method excluded the possibilityof  oral argument.   On  the other  hand, it did  possess the advantage  that the&quot; tribunal &quot; was composed of persons who did not possess the nationality of either of the disputants and in whose selection they had had no voice at  all.    38.  In the next stage the tribunal was set up by agreement  between the partiesfor the settlement of a particular dispute.   Normally, each party appointed one, ortwo, members of the tribunal, and one or three neutral members were appointed byagreement between the parties or by the Head of a third State.   In this case, again,the tribunal was purely an  ad  hoc one and not what we mean  by a &quot; court &quot;; themembers might never have met before and might never meet again.  Moreover, the strong national element in  the  court not infrequently produced the result that thedecision was, in fact, the decision of the neutral members only, and in the case whereonly the president of the tribunal was a neutral, the decision might  well be his alone,since  it happened with unfortunate  frequency that the national members of thetribunal found in favour of their own country.    39.  The third stage consisted in the establishment of the Permanent Court ofArbitration under the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907.  What the conventionsset up, although called a court, was in fact only a panel of lawyers,  from which members could  be  drawn to form a court in particular cases.  When such a casearose, a tribunal was  constituted from this panel by each party appointing twoarbitrators, and the  four  thus  selected  choosing  an  umpire.  Under  the 1899Convention, each party could appoint two of its nationals as arbitrators, but underthe 1907 one, one of its nominees must be the national of another State.  It will beseen that this method was open to much the same objections as the second, since thetribunal was still an ad hoc one, and contained a strong (under the 1899 Conventionoverwhelming) national element. The improvement resulting from  the Conventionconsisted in the fact that (1) the parties&apos;  freedom of choice was limited to personswho had been appointed members of the &quot; court,&quot; and thus might be presumed  to possess some  qualifications for the task; (2) there was, at any rate,  a possibility thatthe more distinguished members of the panel would be called upon to sit frequently,and might thus begin to work in the way associated with our idea of a court; and(3) the convention laid down a definite procedure.    40.  The fourth  stage consisted in the establishment of the Permanent Courtof International Justice. This is really a court in the sense in which we understand the term.   It consists of eleven judges and four deputy judges,  who are elected fora period of nine years; the quorum for the court is nine,  but whenever possible elevenjudges sit, the places of any who are unable to  attend being filled by deputy judges.The procedure of the court is  definitely laid down in its  Statute and Rules  ofProcedure.   Under this method the ad, hoc element is completely eliminated, andthe element of national representation is also eliminated, subject to  a provision underwhich, if one party to the dispute has one of its nationals on the  bench and the otherhas not, the latter is  entitled  to appoint somebody to sit for the particular case.Subject to the  above,  the composition of the court  is entirely  independent of  the identity of the  parties to the litigation or the nature of the case.     41.  It  will be  seen,  therefore,  that, as regards international litigation,  theprocess has been to move away from the idea of a tribunal largely representing theparties and established for the  purpose of a particular dispute to a permanent courtin the real sense of the word.   It is generally recognised that the change made inthese respects by the establishment of the Permanent Court of International Justiceis the greatest  step forward which has been made in connexion with internationalarbitration, and if particular interests or preoccupations should render it impossible,when an inter-Imperial court is set up, to adopt something like the fourth methoddescribed above, and it were found necessary to go  back to either the third or  thesecond, this would be a step which could only be justified on the ground that no other course could, in fact,  secure acceptance by  the Dominions,  or that  no other course was found practicable.
                           Constitution, of Tribunal.    42.  Assuming,  therefore,  that, as stated in paragraph 32, the establishmentof some Tribunal is necessary, we turn to consider the possible alternative methods.(a) Permanent Court.    43.  If the principle of a Permanent Court be accepted, we think that the court should be composed of a number of judges, being subjects of His Majesty, selected from persons in the  United Kingdom and  in the various Dominions who hold,  or have held, high judicial office and  representing each of the Members of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations.  It would probably be desirable so to frame the qualifi-cations for appointment as to enable one member of the Commonwealth, if it chose,to  nominate   a  person  or  persons duly  qualified  in some other part of  theCommonwealth.    44.  We suggest that each Member should be entitled to nominate one Judgeand one or more Deputy Judges, and that appointment should be either for a termof years or until a certain age limit is reached..    45.  Permanent offices would  have to be established  for the  Court under  aRegistrar, who might be chosen by the  Court itself,  subject to the  approval of alltrie Members of the Commonwealth.  It seems to us appropriate and  convenient thatthese permanent offices should be situate in London.    46.  For the determination of any particular dispute, the  Full Court should sit, and if any Judge is not available, one of the Deputies nominated by the Memberwhom he represents should take his place.    47.  The place where the Court should  sit for the determination of a particulardispute would, we think, be a matter for the Governments concerned, having regardto the  nature  of  the particular case.  We suggest that, unless  the parties to thedispute otherwise agree, the Judge representing the country in which the  Court sitsshould be the President of the Court for the determination of that dispute.(b) Arbitration Tribunal.    48.  If it should prove impossible to secure the adoption of the principle of aPermanent Court, recourse must be had to an ad hoc tribunal for particular casesbased upon the system of an arbitration panel.  We suggest that under this systemeach member of the Commonwealth should  be asked to nominate  as  members of the panel a fixed number of persons possessing  qualifications similar to  those indicated above for Judges of a Permanent Court or other special qualifications.  The personsso nominated  should remain on the panel  for a  fixed  period, say,  five years, but should be eligible for reappointment up to a fixed age limit; provision must, however,be made whereby  any  person  whose period of  service on  the panel expires afterselection as a  member of the tribunal for the purpose of a particular dispute maycontinue to sit until  judgment is delivered.  We have considered whether  it shouldbe left to each member  of the  Commonwealth to determine for  itself that period,but we have come to  the conclusion that  a fixed period is desirable in order to avoid any possibility of penalising Judges who may have given decisions objectionable totheir Governments.    49.  There would have to be some kind  of permanent secretariat, and we suggestthat the  Clerk of the Crown in London  for the time being would be  an  appropriateperson to act  as  secretary  and convener of the  tribunal.  The. secretary, or some person nominated by him with  the assent of the Governments concerned, would actas registrar of any tribunal which might be constituted from time to time.  Thecountry in which the tribunal  should sit would be a matter for the Governmentsconcerned.    50.  Provision would have to  be made for the setting  up of a tribunal as andwhen occasion required, and we suggest that any member of the  commonwealth should be entitled to notify the secretary that it desired a tribunal to be set up forthe determination of a pending dispute,  and that such notice should  state the names of the parties to the dispute and the nature of the dispute.  On receipt of the notice the secretary would inform all members of the  Commonwealth, and each of  theparties mentioned in the notice would be bound to select from the panel two, or, ifthe parties mutually agreed, three  Judges,  of whom not more than one should be a
Judge  originally nominated by  the  Member of  the  Commonwealth making  the selection.   The selection of a President would be a matter for the tribunal itself,and we suggest that the President should be selected from among other members ofthe panel, with the proviso that he should not be a person nominated to the panelby either of the parties to the dispute.  The tribunal as fully constituted would thusconsist of five (or seven)  members, including the President.    51.  As the Judges on the  panel will be  persons  of standing in their  own countries, it seems to us impossible, to provide that, on being thus selected by another member of  the  Commonwealth,  they  must necessarily  come under  an obligationto sit.   It might, for instance, be extremely inconvenient for Australia to allow itsChief Justice to proceed to London for the hearing of a  particular dispute, and we-therefore  think that some provision  must be  made  whereby the secretary  willascertain whether the persons selected will be available,  and that, in the event ofthe services of any person being unavailable, the Member of the Commonwealth by whom he was selected should be asked  to select another Judge.    52.  We have  examined the  question whether any  Member of  the Common-wealth, not  a party to  the  dispute,  which may  consider  itself interested in  thesubject matter of the dispute, should have the right either to nominate additional judges, or to be heard by the Tribunal. We do not think that the Dominions wouldbe likely to accept any such proposals in view  of their  insistence that the judgment of any tribunal of the kind should only be binding on the parties before it; but wesuggest that the machinery should be made  sufficiently flexible to  allow of  this development  if the  parties agree that  it is desirable.    53.  Alternatively, if it should be thought that all members of the Common-wealth are indirectly interested in any dispute between two or more of its members,then we think that  it would probably  be better to provide that the tribunal shouldon every occasion be constituted of Judges  representative of every part of  theCommonwealth.  There are, however, likely to be  objections from the Dominions tO&apos;any such course as tending to give the tribunal a position similar to that occupiedby the Supreme Court of the United States.   The proposal which we have outlined in paragraph 48 above does not preclude the possibility,  if the parties to a dispute-so desire, of a tribunal on which in fact  every part  of the Commonwealth is represented.                   Jurisdiction  and  Procedure  of Tribunal.    54.  The considerations under this heading seem to us to apply equally whetherthe principle of a Permanent Court or of an Arbitration Tribunal be adopted.   Weare of opinion that only Members of the British  Commonwealth should  appear as-parties and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal should be limited to the determination of disputes of a justiciable nature between two or more Members.    55.  We consider  that it is not desirable to attempt to define the jurisdictionwith greater precision.   It might be thought possible to draw an analogy from the optional  Clause, but it is difficult to devise any satisfactory alternative to  the phrase &quot; international obligation &quot; there used, a phrase which is clearly undesirablein the present connexion.  The jurisdiction must  cover-    (a) The class of cases which,  if arising between foreign countries, would come-           within the  scope of the Optional  Clause, in  so far as such cases could           arise as justiciable disputes between  Members of the British Common-           wealth of Nations; and    (b) Disputes arising out of the special relationships between  Members of the           British Commonwealth.    56.  In these circumstances, it seems  to us better  to use simply  the phrase&quot; disputes  of a  justiciable nature.&quot;   Provision  should also be  made  that  thejurisdiction  should extend  to the determination of any dispute which the partiesthereto might agree to  submit to the Tribunal.   If  any question arises  whetherjurisdiction exists in a particular case, the Tribunal should be empowered to decide,subject to the right of either party  to secure the suspension of  the proceedingspending further discussion of the matter between the  parties or at an ImperialConference.  Subject to  any such  questions, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal wouldbe compulsory;  i.e., either party to a  dispute would be entitled to bring the other party  before the Tribunal in order that a judicial determination of the dispute should be obtained.
     57.  There is one point to which we desire to draw attention,  although we do not feel able to suggest any particular means of dealing with it.  It may well happen that in the  course of private litigation between parties in the Courts of the United Kingdom or a Dominion, a point may arise which involves an issue between Govern- ments (e.g., as  between the United  Kingdom and the Irish  Free State, a point involving the interpretation of the Articles of Agreement of the 6th December, 1921). It might at first sight appear attractive that provision should be made that in such circumstances the  private  litigation in the municipal  Courts  should  be stayed pending determination  of the inter-Governmental issue by the suggested  Tribunal. But on the whole we doubt whether any such provision would be generally acceptable, and it would certainly  give rise  to practical difficulties.   In the circumstances,  we think that it would be better on  the analogy of international practice, to  allow the private litigation to run its course.  It would then be for the Government interested, if it so desired, to raise the particular point with which it was concerned before the proposed new Tribunal.  In that  event, complications might arise if the result of the proceedings before the new Tribunal Avere such as to affect the  rights of the parties to the private litigation as  determined by the Courts before which that litigation had taken place.  Such difficulties are not unfamiliar in connexion with international litigation;  they can be  solved or minimised if the international Tribunal realises that any order which it makes must be such as the State concerned can carry out without involving  itself in constitutional or other difficulties of a serious character, and we do not think it possible to make any recommendations for dealing with such difficulties in advance.    58.  Questions of procedure will be settled by rules,  but it does not seem to us that any useful purpose would be served at this stage by preparing an elaborate code. Ultimately,  a code of rules  would have to be drawn up by agreement with all the Governments concerned, and until That is done  it would probably be sufficient to provide that the Tribunal may lay down its own rules of procedure.    59.  There is,  however,  one point to which special reference seems to  us desirable, namely,  the question of the form in which judgment should be given.  It seems to us preferable that there  should be only one judgment, to be delivered by tlhe President, on the analogy of the practice followed by the Judicial Committee, and that no indication  should be given whether it is a unanimous decision or not.  If dissenting judgments or an  indication of dissent are permitted, there will, we feel, be a tendency for a weak national Judge to dissent from any judgment given against his country, and this is clearly very undesirable. If, however, any indication of lack of unanimity is permitted, we are clear that a  dissenting Judge may be required to give the reasons for his dissent.   In any event, provision must be made whereby thedecision of the majority shall prevail.    60.  It would probably be  necessary to provide that a decision  shall only be binding on  the parties to  the  particular  dispute, and  that those  parties must undertake to give effect to the judgment.    61.  There remains the question how the expenses  of the tribunal  should be met.   It appears to us  unlikely that  the tribunal would be called upon to act very frequently, and, in these circumstances, it does not seem necessary to make provision for anything in the nature of salaries, either for the Judges or for the registrar or secretary.    62.  As regards judges, we  think that they should receive,  when sitting, fees on a uniform scale, to be paid by the Government by whom they were in  the first instance nominated.  The expenses  of any permanent staff, including stationery, cost of telegrams, &amp;c, should be borne in the first place by the Government of the country in  which  the  expenditure  is  incurred, subject to repayment in  agreed proportions  by  the  other Governments.  The expenditure incurred by the tribunal in the hearing of particular cases (including, for example, travelling expenses and subsistence allowances for the Judges) should be borne equally by the parties to the case.   It seems very undesirable that the tribunal should have  any power to award costs to or against any party appearing before  them, and we therefore suggest that the invariable rule should be adopted, that each party pays its own costs of presenting its case.
                              Position of India.    63.  The  position in India,  in regard to any  such  tribunal,  raises peculiarproblems, in view of the special relationship which  exists, or may hereafter exist,Detween His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government ofIndia.  We do not think the time is yet ripe to discuss  the problems involved in attempting to fit India with the scheme of such tribunal.APPENDIX.Extract from Report of the Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation                   and Merchant Shipping Legislation, 1929.        Part VII. Suggested Tribunal for the Determination of Disputes.    125.  We felt that our work would not be complete unless we gave some con-sideration to the question of the establishment of a tribunal as a means of determiningdifferences and disputes between members of the British Commonwealth.   We were impressed with the advantages which might accrue from the establishment of sucha tribunal.  It was clearly impossible in the time at our disposal to do more thancollate various suggestions with  regard first, to the constitution of such a tribunal,and secondly, to the jurisdiction which it might exercise.  With regard to the former,the prevailing view was that any such tribunal should take the form of  an ad hocbody selected from standing panels nominated by the several members of the BritishCommonwealth.   With regard to the latter, there was general agreement that thejurisdiction should be limited to justiciable issues arising between  Governments.We recommend  that the whole subject should  be further examined by all theGovernments.o

imperial conference and EconomicConference,1930. PolicyCommittee.MerchantShippinglegislation.Keport of theConference onthe operationof DominionLegislationand MerchantShippingLegislation,1929.    1.  THE COMMITTEE  had  under  consideration  a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade on Merchant Shipping Legislation (Paper No.I.E.C. (30) 24) circulated in connection with the Report of the Conference on theOperation  of Dominion  Legislation  and  Merchant  Shipping  Legislation,   1929,Cmd. 3479 (Paper No. I.E.C. (30) 16).    As explained in the  Memorandum, if the recommendations of the Conferencein regard to merchant shipping are accepted and acted upon, legislation would been acted in  Great Britain and in the various Dominions under which each Dominionwill, among its other powers, have complete legislative authority over all ships within its territorial waters or engaged in its coasting trade, and also over its own registeredships, both intra-territorially and  extra-territorially.  The Conference  recognisedthat this development might give rise to conflict of legislation and administration inthe different parts of the Empire, and emphasised the strong presumption in favourof concerted action between the members of the British Commonwealth in shippingmatters.    THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE expressed the opinion thatit Avas of great importance  that the  agreements contemplated  by the conference should be made before any new legislation is passed, and he proposed, if his colleaguesapproved, to endeavour to get the draft agreement settled in a form acceptable to hiscolleagues and the Government Departments concerned as  speedily as possible.  he also suggested that, as soon as this had been done, a brief statement of the position,together with a copy of the draft agreement as settled, should be sent to the DominionGovernments.    THE COMMITTEE agreed to approve the proposals of the President of theBoard of Trade summarised above.    2.  THE COMMITTEE had before them the Report  of the Conference named in the margin (Paper No. I.E.C. (30)  16), and a Memorandum  by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs covering a Summary of Proceedings of the 1926 ImperialConference (Paper No. LEG. (30) 22).    THE COMMITTEE examined the variousset out in Parts III to VII of the Report.conclusions and recommendations                             Part III. Disallowance and Reservation.Paragraph 23.     THE COMMITTEE took note of, and accepted generally, the conclusion reached          by the Conference  that the  present constitutional  position is  that the power of          disallowance can no longer be exercised in relation to Dominion legislation, and that,          accordingly, those Dominions who possess the power  to amend their constitutions in          this respect can, by following the prescribed procedure,  abolish the legal power of         - disallowance if they so desire.  In the case of those Dominions  who do  not possess          this poAver, it  would be  in  accordance with  constitutional practice that,  if so          requested by the Dominion concerned, the Government of the United Kingdom should          ask Parliament to pass the necessary legislation.Paragraph 24.     THE COMMITTEE also adopted the conclusion reached by the Conference in          regard to the position under  the Colonial Stock  Act, 1900, videlicet that, where a          Dominion Government has complied with the condition prescribed by  the Treasury          and set out in that paragraph, and there is any stock Avhich is a trustee  security in          consequence of such  compliance,  the right of  disallowance  in respect of such          legislation must remain and can properly be exercised.              THE COMMITTEE took note of the conclusions of the Conference  relating to          Reservation set out in paragraphs 32 to 36, inclusive, of the Report.               Part  IV. The Extra-Tterritorial Operation of  Dominion Legislation.              THE COMMITTEE  adopted the recommendation of the Conference that  the          competence of  Dominion  Parliaments  to give  their legislation extra-territorial          operation should be placed beyond possibility of doubt by means of a declaratory          enactment in the following terms, passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom,          with the consent of all the Dominions : Paragraph 43.          &quot; It is hereby declared and enacted that  the Parliament of a Dominion  has j              full  power to make laws  having extra-territorial operation.&quot;
    The position with regard to the extra-territorial immunities relating to internal Paragraph 44.discipline enjoyed by the armed forces of  one  Government when  present  in  theterritory of another Government with the  consent of the latter was explained, andthe Committee agreed with the suggestion of the Conference that provision  shouldbe made by each member of the Commonwealth to  give effect to such customary extra-territorial  immunities  within its territory  as regards other  members  of  theCommonwealth.    In this connection the Committee were reminded that, at their  meeting  on  the27th November, 1929 (Cabinet 59 (29), Conclusion (B)), the Cabinet had decided infavour of this particular recommendation.  It was mentioned  that this subject wouldbe more fully dealt with  in another Memorandum for the  Committee now in preparation.                    Part  V. Colonial Laws Validity Act.    The Committee adopted the recommendations of the Conference  that legislation Paragraphs 50should be enacted declaring in terms that the Colonial Laws Validity Act should no and 61-longer apply to the laws passed by any Dominion,  and that  there should also be a substantive enactment declaring the powers of the  Parliament of a Dominion, lesta simple repeal of the Colonial Laws Validity Act might be held to have restoredthe old common law doctrine.    The Committee agreed that, as recommended by the Conference,  effect  should Paragraph 53.be given to these proposals by means of clauses in the  following form :         &quot; (1)  The Colonial Laws  Validity Act, i865,  shall cease to apply  to any    law made by the Parliament of a Dominion.        (2) No law and no provision of any law hereafter made by  the Parliament    of a Dominion shall be void or inoperative on  the ground that it is repugnant    to the law of England or to the provisions of any existing or future Act of    Parliament or to any order, rule or regulation made thereunder,  and the powers    of the Parliament of a Dominion shall  include the power  to repeal or amend any    such Act, order, rule or regulation in so far as the same is part of the law of  the    Dominion.&quot;    As regards the problem arising from the existence of a legal power in the Parlia- Paragraph 54.ment of the United Kingdom to legislate for the Dominions, the Committee acceptedthe view of the Conference that the appropriate method of reconciling the existenceof this power with the established constitutional  position  would be to place on record a statement embodying the conventional  usage, the statement  to be  in  thefollowing  terms :         &quot; It would be in accord with the  established constitutional position of all    members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that no law hereafter    made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall extend to any Dominion    otherwise than at the request and with the consent of that Dominion.&quot;    The Committee agreed that this constitutional convention should appear as a formal recital or preamble in the  proposed  Act of the Parliament of the UnitedKingdom, and that the proposed Act should also contain a declaration and enactmentin the following  terms :         &quot; Be it  therefore declared and enacted that no Act of Parliament hereafter Paragraph 65,    made shall extend or be deemed to extend to a Dominion unless it  is expressly    declared therein that that Dominion has requested and consented to the enact-    ment thereof.&quot;    After  some discussion the Committee adopted  the conclusions contained inparagraphs 59 and 60 of the Report respecting  the  recognition to be given to  theposition of the Crown and the proposed safeguards with respect to the succession tothe Throne and the Royal Style and Titles.  They  accordingly accepted the  recom-mendation that  the proposed  convention should  be formally put  on record  in  thefollowing terms :          &quot; Inasmuch as the  Crown  is the symbol of the free association  of  the    members of  the British Commonwealth of Nations, and as they are united by a    common allegiance  to the Crown,  it would  be in accord with  the  established    constitutional position  of all the members of the Commonwealth in relation to    one another  that any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne    or the Royal Style  and Titles  shall hereafter require the assent as  well of  the    Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of  the United Kingdom.&quot;      [21365]                                                       B 2
    Some discussion took place regarding the proposals set out on pages 21 to 24 ofthe Report relative to the power of the Dominions to amend their own Constitutions.It was pointed out that the proposed clause set out in paragraph 66 applies only tothe Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia and the Dominion of NewZealand, and is not applicable to the  Union of South Africa and the Irish  FreeState.   In these circumstances the criticism would certainly  be made that the IrishFree State had been legally empowered to alter their constitution in conflict with theArticles of Agreement of 1921, and only remained morally bound by the provisionsof the Articles of Agreement.   In  effect,  what  His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom have up to now contended to be a legal limitation on the legislativecapacity of the Irish Free State would have become merely a matter of contract.  Onthe other  hand,  it was mentioned that the Irish Free State had always taken this latter view, and  it was urged that, in a  case of this kind, a moral sanction was quitelikely to be stronger than a legal sanction.    The Committee agreed that, in view of the very delicate  considerations involvedin Part V of the Report, it would be very desirable that there should be informalconfidential  discussions with the Dominion representatives  before  the  Conferencebegan.    In connection with the definitions  of  the words &quot; Dominion &quot; and  &quot; Colony,&quot;set out in the draft clause in paragraph 81 of the Report,  the Committee were informed  that   the question  of the  position  of Newfoundland was receivingconsideration.Paragraph124.Part VI. Merchant Shipping Leciislation and Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act,                                    1890.    The Committee took note that the  questions raised  in  Part VI  were coveredby the decision taken on the Memorandum by the President  of the Board of Trade(Paper No. I.E.C. (30) 24).    With regard,  however,  to the position of  India, the Committee agreed withthe conclusion set  out on  page 40 of the Report that the question of  the propermethod of applying the principles of the Conference^ recommendations  to  india should be considered by His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and theGovernment of India.Action takenby theDominions onthe Reportof theConference.The Advioeto the Crownon DominionMatters.        Part VII. Suggested, Tribunal for the Determination of Disputes.    The subject matter of Part VII of the Report was dealt with by the committee at their 5th Meeting (LEG. (30) 5th Conclusions).    3.  THE COMMITTEE were informed by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs that the Parliaments of the Dominion of Canada, the Union of South africa and the Irish Free State had all passed Resolutions approving  the recommendationsof the Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation.  In the debate in theSouth African House of Assembly, General Smuts had taken the line that the effectof the  acceptance  of  the recommendations would  make  it  impossible for anyDominion to secede from the Empire.   This had raised considerable disturbance inSouth Africa, and the Report had finally been adopted by the House with a proviso that paragraph 60 should not be taken as &quot; derogating from the right of any memberof the British Commonwealth of Nations to withdraw therefrom.&quot;    It was explained in connection with this point that, whilst it might be arguable that in  practice no  member of the Commonwealth, should  it desire  to  secede, couldbe compelled  to remain a member, paragraph 60 of the Report did not really affectthe matter, since the proposed Constitutional Convention relating to the succession to the  Throne was based on  the  supposition  that all members  of  the BritishCommonwealth desired to continue to be associated as members under the Crown.    THE PRIME  MINISTER intimated  that this  was one of the matters whichwould almost certainly come up at the private discussion which he expected to have with  General Hertzog before the opening of the Conference.    4.   THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Note  by the Secretariescovering a Note by the Interdepartmental Committee  and the attached Report of theLegal Sub-Committee  entitled  &quot;Advice to the Crown  on Dominion  Matters&quot;(Paper  LEG. (30)  18).
r     The special attention of the Committee was drawn to paragraph 50 of the Report, which reads as follows :          &quot;The statement by the Imperial Conference  of  1926 on the subject of     Advice, to which reference has already been made, is in the following terms :              &apos; On  this point we  propose that it should be placed on record that,         apart from provisions  embodied in constitutions or  in specific  statutes         expressly providing for  reservation, it  is recognisd that it is the right of         the  Government of each Dominion to advise the Crown in  all  matters         relating to its own  affairs.  Consequently, it would not be in  accordance         with constitutional  practice  for advice to be tendered to His  Majesty by         His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain in any matters appertaining         to the affairs  of a Dominion against the views of  the Government of that         Dominion,&apos; &quot; and also to the Summary and Conclusions on pages 37,  38  and 39 of the Report (a copy of the  Summary and Conclusions is appended hereto).     With regard  to paragraph  (i) of the  Summary,  emphasis was laid on  the necessity that  the forms used in connection with the external relations of the several parts of the British Empire should be  such as to  make clear to foreign Governments the constitutional position that there is only one Crown, and that all the Governments are Governments of the King.     THE COMMITTEE adopted paragraph (i) of the  Summary.     With regard  to paragraph  (ii) of the  Summary,  THE COMMITTEE were informed of the procedure at present in force under  which in  the case of Letters Patent constituting  the office of  Governor-General,  the Warrant authorising  the Lord Chancellor to affix the Great Seal to the Letters Patent is countersigned by  a United Kingdom Secretary of State.   This latter is  a  statutory requirement  but gives rise to important constitutional questions.  In  1929, when the question was raised semi-officially by the Free  State Government,  the practice was defended on the ground that &apos;&apos; the effective action  in Dominion matters  is that of the Ministers of the Dominions concerned, and that the function of the United Kingdom Ministers consists only in operating  under  His Majesty&apos;s  instructions certain constitutional machinery which has been set in motion on the advice  of the Dominion Government concerned.&quot;  The Free State Government accepted this argument  at the  time.  The view was expressed to the Committee that it would be desirable  to employ the same language should any other Dominion raise a similar question.     It was pointed out that, although this was in the main a question of form, yet it was liable to give rise to acute controversy with the Dominions.     After some further discussion, in  the  course of which the Committee were reminded that the Warrants in question were never  published, and that this fact, when known,  might lessen Dominion opposition to the  existing  procedure,  the Committee agreed      (1)  that the representatives of the United Kingdom at the Imperial  Conference          should  endeavour  to  maintain  the  present procedure  under  which          Warrants giving authority for affixing the Great Seal  are countersigned          by  a United  Kingdom Minister,  subject  to the introduction  into  the          Warrant of a preamble  in the terms suggested  in paragraph 11 (3) of          I.E.C. (30) 18.     (2)  that if it was  found impossible to obtain the agreement of the  Dominions          to this course, the suggestion should be made that these Warrants should          be countersigned, not by a Secretary of State, but by the Lord  Chancellor          himself (as is permissible under the Statute of 1884).     In the course  of discussion,  the Prime Minister  informed the Committee that it had been  agreed, both by  himself and  General Hertzog, that the arrangement made regarding the procedure in the case of the appointment of Lord  Clarendon as Governor-General of South Africa was not to be  regarded as a precedent, and that the whole question of future procedure  should be  left over  for discussion at the Imperial Conference.    THE COMMITTEE considered paragraph  iii of the Summary on the subjectof Advice to the Crown.  It is stated in that paragraph that it would appear from
the statement on this subject by the  Imperial Conference, 1926  (see quotation onpage 7 above), that it is the constitutional right of Dominion Ministers to tenderadvice to the King in matters solely the concern of the particular Dominions whereit is proper  that advice should be tendered  to the King himself and  not to HisMajesty&apos;s Representative.    Doubts were expressed whether this was  a correct appreciation of the position,and it was suggested  that sufficient weight had  not  been  attached to  the  con-siderations set out in the opening sentences of paragraph 52 of I.E.C.  (30) 18; inparticular, it was urged that the expression  &quot; it is  the right of the Government ofeach Dominion to advise the Crown,&quot; meant  in this connection the Crown&apos;s repre-sentative,  viz., the Governor-General.   In this connection, reference was made tothe phraseology of the  second paragraph of  Section (b),  &apos;: Position of  Governors-General,&quot; page 16 of the Summary of the Imperial Conference 1926, Command 2768.    On the other hand,  it  was pointed out that the Dominions undoubtedly inter-preted the statement of the Imperial Conference in the sense set out in paragraph (iii)of the Summary.  If this interpretation was now held to be incorrect, the dominions would certainly insist on the adjustment of the position to conform to their views.    THE COMMITTEE were also reminded  that there were some matters on whichDominion Ministers  could not advise the  Governor-General.   In regard to treaty-making powers, for example, advice could only be tendered to the King and not tothe Governor-General.    After considerable discussion, THE COMMITTEE agreed-     (i) to defer any decision respecting the matters named in paragraphs (iii) to (vi)           inclusive  of   the  Summary  until after their  Conference  with  Lord           Stamfordham.    (ii) to authorise the Secretary to invite Lord Stamfordham to confer with the           Committee at a meeting to be  held on Monday, the 14th July, 1930, at           3 P.M., in the Prime Ministers Room, House of Commons.   (iii) that the Secretary should also be authorised to supply Lord  Stamfordham           with certain  documents circulated  to the Committee.    (iv) to  request  the  Inter-Imperial  Relations  Committee  to prepare  a  brief           statement of  the more important points raised  in the  course of  the           discussion, for  the use  of  Ministers  at  the  Conference  with  Lord           Stamfordham.    (v) to hold the next meeting on Wednesday, the 9th July, 1930, at 3 P.M., in the           Prime Minister&apos;s Room,  House of Commons.   At this meeting there           should be considered the outstanding questions remaining on the Agenda           of the Sixth Meeting.    (vi) to authorise the Secretary to circulate to the Cabinet for information the           conclusions of meetings of the Committee, and to  supply  copies of any           documents circulated  to the Committee  to  any  Cabinet Minister  who           desires to see them.    5.  THE COMMITTEE had before them a Note by the Secretaries, covering aMemorandum  by  the   Inter-Departmental   Committee  on  Economic  Questions,Paper LEG. (30) 23, on Oversea Settlement.    THE COMMITTEE authorised the despatch forthwith to the Governments ofthe Dominions and India copies of the Memorandum in question.    6.  THE COMMITTEE agreed to invite the Secretary of State  for DominionAffairs to circulate for their consideration a Memorandum containing his  suggestionsregarding the procedure  at the Imperial Conference, 1930.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,        July 8,1930.
APPENDIX.Extract from Report of Inter-Departmental Committee on Advice to the Crown on                      Dominion Matters (I.E.C.  (30) 18).                          SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.    (i) AFTEE enumerating the various kinds  of matters  connected  with theDominions which are submitted to the King himself, and examining recent instances where various aspects of the question of Advice have arisen, we suggest that the mainguiding principle is that, apart from matters submitted to the King in his personal capacity, or as the Fountain of Honour and the Fountain of Justice, matters relatingto the internal affairs of a Dominion are dealt with by the Governor-General, whilematters relating to its external affairs are submitted to the  King himself, and werecommend that on general grounds it would appear  most  desirable to maintain thepresent position in this  respect (paragraphs 1-39 and 48).    (ii) In particular we refer to the recent questions which have arisen with regardto the appointment of Governors-General, and make  certain recommendations as toalterations in the Letters Patent constituting the office of Governor-General and theRoyal Instructions.  In this connection we discuss the question of advice  in regardto the affixing of the  Great Seal  to Dominion documents,  and  recommend that theRoyal Warrant authorising the affixing of the Seal  in such cases  should commencewith  a  preamble  making  clear  the  responsibility   of  Dominion   Ministers(paragraphs  8-12).    (iii)  We discussed the statement of the Imperial Conference, 1926, on the subjectof Advice, and indicate that it appears to follow from this paragraph that it is theconstitutional right of Dominion  Ministers to tender advice  to  the King in matterssolely the concern of the particular Dominion where  it is proper that advice shouldbe tendered  to the  King  himself,  and  not  to His Majesty&apos;s Representative(paragraphs  50-52).    (iv)  We  point out  the advantages  of the existing channel of communicationthrough United Kingdom Ministers, who are able to act as  a co-ordinating centre,and point out  that the action  of  United Kingdom Ministers is limited to the presentation of the advice of Dominion Ministers (paragraph 53).    (v) With a view to the avoidance of the danger of contrary advice being tenderedin cases  where more  than  one of His  Majesty&apos;s  Governments are concerned, werecommend the desirability of securing the acceptance of a constitutional principle,analogous to the principle already accepted with regard to the negotiation of treaties,that any Government  of His Majesty, before tendering advice to  the King in any matter, should &apos;&apos; give due consideration to its possible effect upon other Governments,and should take steps to inform Governments likely to be interested  of its intention &quot;(paragraphs  54-57).    (vi)  We  discussed alternative channels of advice     (a)  through the Governor-General, by telegraphic or written  communication to          the King ;    (b)  through a Dominion Minister, by direct  audience of the King;.    (c) through the High Commissioner  in London;and  indicate various considerations Avhich  arise  with  regard   to the  possibleemployment of each of these channels (paragraphs 59-63).    (vii) We point out the great importance of securing the avoidance of any unduestrain upon the King, and recommend that endeavour should  be  made to arrange that United Kingdom Ministers should be ^retained as the  normal channel by whichDominion Ministers tender advice to His Majesty, other  channels being used only when  peculiar reasons may render some other  channel desirable in some particular case (paragraphs 64, 65).

imperial conference and EconomioConference(1930). PolicyCommittee.Advice to theCrown onDominionmatters.Regency andCognateQuestions.    1.  THE PRIME MINISTER  informed  the  Committee that  the  Inter-Departmental Committee on Inter-Imperial Relations had prepared the statementof the more important points raised in the discussion at the previous Meeting onthe subject of Advice to the Crown on Dominion Matters.  This statement would be circulated to the Committee and a copy would be sent to Lord Stamfordham (for thestatement in question see I.E.C. (30), a copy of which, for convenience of reference,is attached hereto (Appendix I)).    2.  THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the  Third Report  of theInter-Departmental  Committee on Inter-Imperial Relations covering a Report ofthe Legal Sub-Committee on Regency and Cognate Questions (Paper I.E.C. (30) 19).This  Report, after  stating the nature  of the problem,  examined  the  variouscontingencies under  the following heads     (1) Minority of the Heir to the Throne on the Demise of the Crown,    (2) Absence of the Heir to the Throne on the Demise of the Crown,    (3) Total incapacity of the Sovereign,    (4) Partial incapacity of the Sovereign,    (5) Absence of the Sovereign,and made suggestions with regard to the Form of  Legislation.  The Summary of recommendations on pages 15 and 16 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report are appendedhereto for convenience of reference (Appendix II).    The conclusions reached by  the  Committee  on the  recommendations  and suggestions contained in the Report may be summarised as follows : (1) Minority of the Heir to the Throne.    The Committee adopted the suggestions contained in paragraphs 9, 10 and 11of the Report, which read as follows :          9. &quot; For the reasons set out above we think that it would be desirable to    make permanent statutory provision  for  this  contingency.   It  would  not,    however, be practicable in any such legislation to foresee all possible circum-  , stances, and, moreover, it  would seem proper that the Sovereign should have    within certain defined limits the choice of the person who, besides being Regent,    would also be the guardian of the infant Heir. In the circumstances we suggest    that the Sovereign should  by Statute be enabled by some appropriate method to    nominate from time to time, from a class of persons to be defined in the Statute,    the person to be Regent and Guardian on the demise of the Crown.  The class    of persons so&apos; defined would naturally include the Royal  Consort and the Mother    of the Heir (not necessarily the same person),  in addition to the various persons    capable under the Act of  Settlement of succeeding to  the  Throne in order of    succession.  We think  it essential, however, for reasons which wre set  out more    fully in paragraph  14 below, that the class of persons should be limited in this    way to Members of  the Royal Family.         10. The most appropriate method of nomination  would appear  to be by    Letters Patent under the  Great Seal, which  could be issued at any time, and    would be revocable at any  time.   The nomination,  when made, would  be    communicated in this  country  to Parliament, and, as  regards  the Dominions,    direct from the Sovereign to the Governors-General.         11. Failing a nomination by the Sovereign, the first person in the class of    persons set out in the Act who is not disqualified by minority or otherwise should    automatically become Regent and Guardian.&quot;(2) A bsence of the Heir on  the Demise of the Crown.    The Committee adopted the suggestions contained in paragraphs 14 and 16 ofthe Report, which read as follows :          14. &quot; As  regards  the &quot;persons  to  be appointed, in view  of the present    constitutional position, particularly having regard to the objections raised by    the Irish Free State in 1929 to the inclusion among the Counsellors of State of    members of the Government and other high personages in the United Kingdom,    it would be essential now, notwithstanding the precedent of the Act of 1837,    that the persons  should be selected solely from members of the Royal Family.    We suggest, therefore,  that provision should be made that the first three persons,
 (3) Total Incapacity of the Sovereign.     The  Committee were reminded that in their Report the Sub-Committee had favoured  the appointment of the Heir to the Throne as single Regent, as being in accordance with past constitutional precedents.  The association of a second person would give rise to difficulties and complications which it was most desirable to avoid. In this connection it was recalled that  in  1789 the Irish Parliament had argued strongly for the Heir to the Throne as single Regent, and this precedent might carry weight with Irish Free State authorities. It might be asked why the arrangements made in 1928 could not be repeated on  future occasions, the answer was that the contingency under consideration is one of the total incapacity of the Sovereign, not partial incapacity, as in 1928.  Moreover, at that time  the Heir to the  Throne was absent from the Realm.     The  Committee adopted the view  that  statutory provision  should  be  made for the future to meet the contingency of the total incapacity of the Sovereign, and that the Heir  to  the  Throne should be sole Regent,  and  that  it  would also  be necessary  to make  further provision for Regency in the event of the minority of the Heir similar to that set out in paragraphs 9 and 11 of  the Report, while provision should also be made for the application of the procedure set out in paragraph 14 in the event  of the absence of the Heir.     Some  discussion took  place on the question examined in paragraph  19 of the Report, respecting the  limitations, if any, to be  imposed  on the powers of  the Regent.  General  agreement was expressed with the view that in modern circum- stances it  would be very undesirable to limit the powers of the Regent (as was done in past Regency statutes) in the matters of the right to dissolve Parliament or to create  peerages, the prohibition of assent to any  Bill altering the  Order of  the Succession to the Throne would not presumably arise if the matter were dealt with as  suggested  in   paragraph  60  of  the Report  of  the Dominions  Legislation Conference: On the other hand, it was pointed out that on occasions of incapacity in past history the Sovereign had  attached great importance to limitations being imposed on the Regent &apos;s powers.    The view was expressed that, so far as the Dominions were concerned,  the questions of substance would be the personnel of the body which should be empoweredto declare the existence  of the incapacity and the form  of the requisite legislation. In this connection  reference was made to  the possibility  of simplifying the arrange-ments  so  as  to avoid Parliamentary difficulties,  but  the  reasons  which renderlegislation essential were indicated, and the  view was expressed that parliamentary difficulties would be increased rather than diminished by  substantial departures from precedents.    It was pointed out that the procedure adopted in 1928 was based on precedentsof the absence of the Sovereign abroad,  when the delegation of powers  had been effected by Order in Council, Royal Proclamation  and Letters Patent; objection tothis  procedure was taken ,by the Irish Free  State  in 1928, and would no doubt betaken in future.   .    The Committee were informed that the Dominions might ask  that  the  bodyempowered ito declare incapacity should be representative of all the Dominions; inthis event,  the Dominions might wish to be represented by their High commissioners in London.      [21396]                                                       B  2being of age and available within the United Kingdom, of the class of personsset out in the Act as qualified to be Regent (see paragraph 9 above), should act,until  the arrival of the new Sovereign, as Guardians of the Realm.   We havesuggested this title, which can claim to be of respectable antiquity (it appearsat any rate in the time of Henry VI in the Latin form (C list odes Rvgni)), in preference to the title of Lords Justices, which appears in the Act of 1837, inorder to mark the changed constitutional position.    16. There is one further  point which  would  need consideration.  Thefirst step on the Demise of  the  Crown is to ascertain by what title the Heirwishes to be proclaimed as Sovereign.  The procedure adopted in the past forthis purpose has been informal in character.  It might present difficulties in pheevent of the absence of the Heir from the United Kingdom.  If he were in anypart of the Empire it would no doubt be for the appropriate authority there toascertain and to communicate without delay the new Sovereigns wishes in thisrespect/&apos;
               The Committee agreed-                (1) That, in the first  instance,  the  suggestion to be made  should  be  that the                     body of persons empowered to  declare the incapacity of the Sovereign                     should, as suggested in paragraph 20 of the Report, be the Royal Consort,                     the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of  the  Rolls                     and the Speaker of the House of Commons, or any three of them.               (2) That if this should prove unacceptable to the Dominions, the matter should                     be  further examined.          (4)  Partial Incapacity of the Sovereign.          (5)  Absence of the Sovereign.               The Committee took  note and approved generally the proposals contained          in paragraphs 23, 24 and 25 of the Report relating to these matters.          Form of Legislation.               The Sub-Committee&apos;s  Report, paragraph 26, contained the following recom-          mendations respecting the form of legislation needed to give effect to the proposals          in the Report:                   &quot; This being so, the most convenient course would be that the  Parliament              of the United  Kingdom should pass  the necessary legislation for the  whole               Commonwealth  at  the request  and with the consent of  the Dominions in              accordance with the principle set out in paragraph 54  of that report.  If the              Dominions are unwilling to accept this course, the United Kingdom statute, in              accordance with paragraph 56 of the report, will not apply in respect of the              Dominions, and it will be  for the.Dominions to pass the necessary legislation              for themselves.   It would seem sufficient for that legislation to provide that acts              done in the Sovereign^ name  by persons  appointed thereto under  the United              Kingdom statute should be  as fully valid for Dominion purposes as though done              by the Sovereign himself.&quot;              The Committee adopted the recommendations set out above.              The Committee agreed to request  the  Inter Departmental  Committee  on          Inter-Imperial Relations to prepare a summary of the more important points raised          in the discussion of the  Report on Regency and Cognate Questions, for the use of          Ministers  at  the  Conference with  Lord  Stamfordham, to whom copies  of this          summary should  be  sent.   The Report  (I.E.C.  (30)  19)  should  not  be  sent  to          Lord Stamfordham.Nationality       3.   THE  COMMITTEE had under consideration the  Second Report of theQuestions    Inter-Departmental Committee  covering a Report of  the Legal  Sub-Committee  on          Nationality  Questions   (Paper  LEU.  (30)  17), the  conclusions  of  which  (on          pages 24-26 of the Report)  are attached hereto (see Appendix III).              At the outset of the discussion, doubts were expressed whether the  Dominions          really wished to raise the question at the  Conference, and emphasis was  laid on the          desirability of avoiding any discussion,  if possible.   On the other hand, it was          pointed out that certain  of the Dominions desired to raise, at any rate, the question          of the nationality of married women, and that this would lead to consideration of          the general question.              SIR C. SCHUSTER drew attention to the difficulty of determining precisely          what those Dominions which favoured extensive changes in the present system really          desired.   It would seem that they wished  to secure by local legislation  that the          citizens of each  Dominion should have  Dominion &quot;nationality,&quot; and  that,  in          addition, a &quot; common status &quot; should be established for all those who possessed the          different nationalities.    This conception must be considered from two points  of          view :        i       (a)  External. Foreign countries fully understand the term  &quot; nationality,&quot; but                    not this novel conception of a common status, and would no  doubt take                    the line that nationality was the only  status that they could recognise.                    The Dominions  which  took the more  extreme  view should be asked                    whether they wished to belong to the Empire community as  a whole; if                    so,  they must have a common national status; if they did not so wish,
          then they must forgo the privileges, and submit to the inconveniences to          which attention is drawn in paragraphs 22 to 28 of the Report.    (b)  Internal. -The United Kingdom was almost unique, in that here all British          subjects enjoyed equal rights.  This was not so in the Dominions, where          the nature and extent of rights enjoyed varies,  as shown in Appendix A          to the Report.               The Dominions could not have the best of both worlds, either a person          was a British subject or he was not, and the only logical test of nationality          was allegiance to one Sovereign, to whom everybody throughout  the          Empire owes allegiance, and by virtue of so doing is a British subject.It was accepted by the Committee without question that the expression &quot; british subject&apos;&apos; did  not  mean a person subject to Great  Britain, and  did  not  connotesubjection to anyone except  the Sovereign.  It would be extremely difficult, if  not impossible, to find  any expression which could take the place of &quot;British subject,&quot;and the political objections  at home and in many  parts of the Empire overseas toany surrender of the term could hardly be exaggerated.    THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL thought that  we should aim at establishing agenus (British  national),  and  within  that genus a number or species (Canadian,Free State, national).  Every effort should be made to persuade the Dominions toagree that national status should not be conferred on outsiders without the  priorconsent  of all the  Governments.   It  was doubtful,  however, whether  some of  theDominions would agree to such a limitation.    After some further discussion, the Committee agreed     (1)  To approve generally the recommendations and suggestions contained in the          Report  on Nationality Questions (LEG. (30) 17), as  summarised  on          pages 24-26 of that Report.    (2)  To request the Inter-Departmental Committee on Inter-Imperial Relations          to prepare for the consideration of the Committee a Memorandum setting          out  briefly the history of the question of the nationality of married          women, and dealing with its political and legal aspects.    4.  THE COMMITTEE had before them a Memorandum, Paper LEG. (30)  11,of a Conference held at the Home Office on the 16th May, 1930, on Questions Relatingto the Precedence and Status of Dominion High Commissioners.    In the course  of an  explanation of the position, Sir E. J.  Harding pointedout that the High Commissioners  wished to be placed  at least in a position of equality with Foreign Ministers in London and that the Government of the Unionof South Africa proposed  to raise the question at the Conference.    The Committee agreed         That if the question  was raised and passed at the Conference,  it might    be possible to  take His Majesty&apos;s Pleasure  regarding the proposal that High    Commissioners for the Dominions should be given precedence after Secretaries    of State.    No definite  conclusion was  reached in regard to the other recommendations contained in Paper  LEG. (30)  11, but the general  view of the Committee wasunfavourable, both to the suggestion that High Commissioners should be made  exofficio  Privy Councillors, or the Office  given  the  title  &quot;Right Honourable&quot;  bycourtesy, and to the suggestion  that the expression &quot;The Honourable&quot; might  beattached to the Office.    5.   With reference to LEG. (30), 5th Conclusions, 18, the COMMITTEE had ^^io^the under further consideration Memorandum No.  VI attached to the First Report of                                                                               Dominions inthe Inter-Departmental Committee on Inter-Imperial  Relations (LEG. (30)  9).

To  approve generally the  recommendations and  suggestions contained  in    LEG. (30) 9 and to request the Inter-Departmental  Committee to prepare for    the early consideration of the  Committee  a Memorandum, in a form suitable    for transmission to the Dominions and India, setting out the various proposals    and the arguments for and against their acceptance.
Prooedureat theConference.ImperialConferenceAgenda and&quot; Economic &quot;Briefs for ministers.    6.  With reference to I.E.C. (30), 6th Conclusions, 6, the SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS suggested that, with a view to saving time atthe opening stages  of the Conference, the Ministerial statements (as, for example,that by himself on Foreign Affairs),  instead of being delivered orally,  should be printed and  circulated to the Conference with an intimation that arrangements would be made for the discussion of any particular question arising on the state-ments of notice was given within a certain period after circulation.    THE COMMITTEE agreed to the adoption of this procedure.    In the course of discussion, the PRIME MINISTER  stated that, among other questions, it  was essential that  the whole problem of Dominion Representation atInternational Conferences and other similar Meetings should be discussed, and alsothat the difficult question of consultation  with the Dominions in matters  of foreignpolicy should be again examined.    7.  THE PRIME  MINISTER expressed  the hope  that  a preliminary draftAgenda for the Conference could be circulated to the Committee during the present week  for consideration.    He also  drew attention to the fact that the whole economic position would be under review at the Conference and that major questions of policy, such as extensionof Preference, the  practicability of an Imperial Economic Union, migration,  &amp;c,should be made the subject of Briefs for  Ministers  on the lines of the Memorandaprepared by  the  Inter-Imperial Relations Committee on Constitutional  and other subjects.   In this connection, attention was drawn to  the desirability of  preparinggapers on  the modern aspects  of Fiscal Policy on  lines similar to memorandaprepared by the Board of Trade at the time of Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s campaign.Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,     July 10, 1930.
APPENDIX  I.(Secret.)                            -I.E.C. (30) 20.                                  CABINET.              Imperial Conference and Economic  Conference,  1930.                              POLICY  COMMITTEE.                   Advice to the Crown on  Dominion Matters.              (Circulated in pursuance of I.E.C. (30) 6th Cons. IV.)    1.   THE passage on page 17 of the Report of the Imperial  Conference, 1926,speaks of &quot; the right of the Government of each Dominion to advise the Crown.&quot;  Isit possible to draw from this a distinction between the right to advise the Crown, inthe person  of the Governor-General,  and  the right  of  approach  to  the Kingpersonally ?    If, however, it were contended, vis-d-vis the Dominions, that Dominion ministers had the right to advise the Governor-General only, and not the King himself, thelatter right being limited to United Kingdom Ministers only, would not such acontention lead Dominion Governments to demand  that all the matters as indicatedin the  Memorandum which  are now referred to the King himself,  Ratifications,Full Powers, &amp;c, should no longer be referred to the King, but should be  dealt withby the Governor-General ?   And, if so, would it be  possible for long to maintain the theory that  there is one King, not seven kings ?    2.   The Memorandum proceeds on the  assumption  that  the King,  being thecommon bond between the various Members of the Commonwealth, and cherished assuch in all the Dominions, all matters, chiefly of external concern,  which have in thepast gone to the King, should continue to do so, so as to emphasise to foreign countries the unity of the Crown and of the Empire.    3.   Does not this view carry with it as a necessary implication, that dominion ministers whose description as His Majesty&apos;s Ministers is a commonplace* are ina position to approach the King in those matters which are dealt with by the Kinghimself ?  How can this be done without     (a)  throwing undue burdens on the King, and    (b)  avoiding the risk of contrary  advice being tendered to His Majesty in           matters which concern more than  one part of his Empire ?    4.   As regards (a) may it not be hoped that, provided that steps are taken to makegenerally  clear that it is the advice of Dominion  Ministers  which is the  effectiveadvice in all Dominion matters, the channel by which that advice should be communi-cated would be a matter on which Dominion Ministers would not take an unreasonableview ?   Would it be possible to get Dominion Governments to agree to their advicebeing ordinarily  tendered through United Kingdom Ministers, provided that their right to approach the King direct either through the Governor-General or in personwere in principle admitted ?    5.  As regards (b) would not the difficulty be met by the recommendation madeby the Committee in paragraph 57 of their Report, viz., that a general constitutionalprinciple should be laid down that any Government of His Majesty before tenderingadvice to the King in any matter should &apos; &apos;give due consideration to its possible effect upon other  Governments, and should take  steps to  inform Governments likely to be interested, of its intention &quot; ?    6.  As regards  the  particular  question of  the appointment  of Governors-General, (a) is it possible to hold the position that other parts of the Empire thanthe Dominion directly affected  are  interested in the appointment of a  Governor-General, and that it is the right of the King to take counsel with any advisers he may desire as to the choice of persons for that office ?   i (* They are described as the &quot; Queen&apos;s/King&apos;s Ministers of State&quot; in the Commonwealth  and SouthAfrican Constitution Acts.  The Canadian Privy Council is called the &quot; Queen&apos;s Privy Council for Canada &quot; inthe British North America Act.)    A  further note is appended containing the  provision relating to the position of the Crown in theDominions in the various Constitution Acts.
s    (b)  If  the  Prime  Minister  of  the Commonwealth is  present  personally inLondon, is it possible for the King to refuse to discuss with him the question of theappointment of a new Governor-General ?                                                &apos;    Dominions Office, July 9, 1930.

Summary of Recommendations.(a) (paragraphs 4-5).     PERMANENT Statutory provision  should be  made for  the various  contin-gencies arising from the  incapacity or  absence of the Sovereign, which are classifiedunder five heads, the arrangements operating  under each head  being so far aspossible automatic.(b) (paragraphs 8-11).  (1) Minority of the Heir to the Throne.     The reigning Sovereign should be  empowered to nominate,  from among a classof persons to be set out (being all Royal personages), a Regent and Guardian for theinfant Sovereign.  The Statute should indicate  the member of the class to becomeRegent and Guardian in the absence of prior nomination by the Sovereign.(c) (paragraphs 12-16).  (2) Absence of the Heir to the Throne.     Three members of the Royal Family,  being  taken in order  from the class to beset out as indicated above, should act as Guardians of the Realm pending the arrival of the new Sovereign.    .. ,   .  .                ,               .......(d) (paragraphs 17-22).  (3) Total incapacity of the Sovereign.     The Heir to the Throne should, in accordance with constitutional precedent, bethe sole Regent;  but we  appreciate that it might be the desire of His Majesty thatthe Royal Consort should be associated in the Regency.  The question what limita-tion if any should be  placed upon the  powers of  the Regent  requires  furtherconsideration.  Provision should be made for the manner in which  the incapacity ofthe Sovereign, and the termination of the incapacity, should be declared.                                        &apos;&quot;(e) (paragraphs 23-24).  (4) Partial incapacity of the Sovereign.     The Sovereign should be empowered to delegate such of his functions as he may deem necessary (including  functions  which he is under any  Statute  required to perform personally),  to members of the Royal Family as Counsellors of State, the delegation being by Letters Patent under the Great Seal.                -V&apos;- .V,,,:,Y ... -           1,,:  .  ; V&apos;,                 ....... ^.               .....      .........(f) (paragraph 25).

Steps should be taken at  the  forthcoming Imperial  Conference to reach agree-ment with the Dominions as to the action to be taken and the form of the necessary legislation.
APPENDIX  III.(I.E.C. (30) 17.)   REPORT OF  INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON NATIONALITY QUESTIONS.                                 Conclusions.    THE  British Commonwealth of Nations as a group of equal States under  asingle Crown each possessing a distinct international personality is unique both inits constitutional  and international aspects.  New ideas are required to meet this situation, more especially as regards nationality.  The idea of two nationalities eachbased on allegiance to the same Crown is a conception wholly unknown  to inter-national law.  The  problem is to  obtain  recognition of  that  conception  so  as to preserve a common status as  a nationality which all the nationals of each memberof the Commonwealth will possess, while  at the same time satisfying the  desire ofthe Dominions to secure  international  recognition of their individual and distinctnationality for the purposes of their  international relations.    It would  appear desirable to  proceed on evolutionary lines rather  than toattempt at the forthcoming Imperial  Conference to solve the  complex problem of nationality within the Commonwealth by any  comprehensive new scheme designedto reconcile  divergent views  and to meet all contingencies.  If one result of  theOperation of Dominion Legislation Conference was to emphasise rather the diversitythan the unity of the Commonwealth in matters of nationality law, it may be thatin the coming years there will be a tendency  to insist rather on the unity.  In that event, it would be unfortunate now to crystallise a series of conceptions which tendto lay stress on diversity.  The whole position is obscure, in that it is not clear howfar the conceptions  of a common status and of a distinct Dominion nationalityoverlap.    With these ideas in view, an attempt has been made in this memorandum tosuggest certain general lines  upon which effect might be given to the Principlesstated in paragraphs 72  and  79 of the Operation of Dominion Legislation Report,.vith a view  to securing agreement as to which of the alternatives discussed in  thismemorandum should be adopted as the basis of development.    It is desirable that any immediate modus vivendi to be adopted should involve he least possible break of continuity in the conception of the common nationality f all subjects of His Majesty.  Any sudden radical change would involve seriousinconvenience in the sphere of domestic, inter-Imperial and international  relations.    The existing constitutional position does not appear necessarily to involve  any immediate change in the law  relating  to  British nationality.   The balance ofadvantage is in favour of maintaining as long as possible the existing system.  Its ontinuance  is not inconsistent with the creation of a distinct  nationality for each nember of the Commonwealth (including the  United Kingdom and its dependencies) y legislation determining what persons, among the general body of British subjects, ire the nationals of  that member.   Such legislation has already  been enacted by  anada and South Africa and appears to have met the international  requirements f those Dominions.    It is by no means certain either (a) that those Dominion representatives at the  operation of Dominion Legislation  Conference who insisted on the principle that  ominion nationality should be the  only  nationality for all international purposes ully appreciated the consequences  involved, and, in particular, the consequences lescribed  in  paragraphs  19  to 28, or (b) that public  opinion in those Dominions vould support a proposal to abandon the present scheme of British nationality,  and vith  it the  expression  &quot; British  subject&quot;   and the  prestige attaching to  that xpression.    These consequences might be emphasised at the Imperial Conference.  It might e pointed out that Dominion nationality,  if established in  accordance  with the xtreme view, as the only nationality of those persons on whom it is conferred, must ecessarily supersede the present common &quot;British&quot; nationality  of those persons; nd that if by further legislation in each  Dominion provision is also made whereby
the nationals of  the  Dominion  shall ipso facto possess  the  common status of&quot;subject of His  Majesty,&quot;  those  persons  on whom  the common  status is thuconferred will not, by virtue of Dominion law only, have any legal claim to the right and privileges and advantages which, as &quot; British &quot; subjects, they at present possesin the United Kingdom and other parts of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions.  Such right and privileges would  be secured  to them  only in  so far as expressly given by thGovernments of the other parts of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions.

He  and his colleagues had  felt that it  would  now  be          advantageous to confer with  Lord Stamfordham and to go over with him, with the          aid of the legal and other official experts, the various points raised in the two Papers          named on the Agenda Advice to the Crown on Dominion Matters  (I.E.C.  (30) 20)          and  Regency and other Questions (I.E.C. (30) 21).crown &apos;nthe      2-  T HK  PRIME  MINISTER drew  special  attention  to  the  openingUo^nion    paragraphs of LEU. (30) 20. If it was established that the passage on page 17 of matters.     the Report of the Imperial Conference, 1926 &quot; the right of the Government of each          Dominion to advise the  Crown&quot; meant  that  Dominion Ministers only  had  the          right to  advise the Governor-General and not  the  King himself,  a claim would          undoubtedly be made that, in future, those matters which are now referred to His          Majesty should be dealt with by the Governor-General.  It would then  no longer be          possible to maintain the theory that there is one King, not seven kings.              For  the reasons  stated  in  the  Memorandum,  the   Committee favoured  the          continuance of the present arrangements under which certain matters,  chiefly  of          external concern, are dealt with by the King himself.  After very careful  considera-          tion of the constitutional aspects of the matter and of the  advice of their legal          experts, the Committee had  come to the conclusion that  it would  be unwise and          inexpedient to adopt the position that Dominion Ministers have no right of access          to the King for the purpose of tendering advice.              3.  LORD STAMFORDHAM asked whether the subject under consideration,          viz., &quot;Advice to the Crown  on Dominion  Matters,&quot; did  not  largely depend upon          the  question referred to  in paragraph 3 of I.E.C.  (30) 20.   If the answer to this          question  was in  the negative, how  could  Dominion  Ministers claim the  right to          tender  advice to the  King,  and on what  grounds  could they claim  to be  &quot; His          Majesty&apos;s Ministers.&quot;   In the United Kingdom the Prime Minister is  appointed          on the sole authority of the King and is His Majesty&apos;s Prime Minister, who appoints          his Ministers, and they thus virtually become His Majesty&apos;s Ministers and so remain          until the  Prime Minister resigns to the King and his resignation is  accepted,  or, as          in the case of William IV and Lord Melbourne,  he is dismissed.              In the Dominions a  similar procedure  was followed and  the Governor-General          took the place of the King.   To the Governor-General advice  was tendered; by the          Governor-General resignation was accepted or refused.              If  his (Lord  Stamfordham&apos;s)  assumption were right,   then  the answer  to          paragraph (5) would be in the affirmative, but even if the  assumption was wrong it          would be  physically unworkable for Dominion Ministers to  advise the King, to whom          they have no access.              If, however, the views  which he had expressed  were not the views of His          Majesty&apos;s Government, it seemed essential that the functions of  the Crown,  as          exercised  by the Sovereign on the one hand and the Governor-General on the other,          should be clearly defined, and the Constitution of the different Dominions amended          accordingly.              No question  arose on paragraph (2) of I.E.C. (30) 20, with the  terms of which          he (Lord  Stamfordham) was in full agreement.           ; &apos;  With regard to paragraphs  (4) and (5)  of LEU.  (30) 20, on the assumption that          his  previous arguments  were  accepted,  it was to  be hoped  that  the  Dominion          Governments might be induced to agree that the channel by which their advice was          tendered  should  be that of His Majesty&apos;s Ministers.   Unfortunately, however,          experience  had  shown that  the  Ministers of certain Dominions wish,  so far  as          possible, to short-circuit Downing Street and communicate direct with Buckingham          Palace.              With regard to paragraph (6) of I.E.C. (30) 20, Lord Stamfordham submitted          that the  appointment of a  Governor-General  does concern  other parts of  the          Empire, and that the King, in making the appointment, can take counsel from anyone          he may desire to consult, but it must be  clearly laid down upon  whose general          advice His Majesty should constitutionally act.  In his (Lord Stamfordham&apos;s) view          this should obviously be the Prime Minister of the United  Kingdom.              With regard to paragraph (6) (6) of LEU. (30) 20, Lord Stamfordham said that          it certainly would not  be  possible for His Majesty to refuse to discuss with          Mr. Scullin the  question of the appointment  of  the new Governor-General, but,
presumably, His  Majesty&apos;s  Ministers  in the United  Kingdom would previouslythoroughly discuss the question with Mr. Scullin before His Majesty saw him, and let His Majesty know what attitude Mr. Scullin proposed to adopt.    4.  THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS observedthat  Ministers were called upon  to  interpret  the conclusions  to which  their predecessors, not they themselves, were parties. Lord Stamfordham had  contended that Dominion Ministers are not His Majesty&apos;s Ministers, and that His  Majesty&apos;ministers are  only those Ministers  functioning in the United Kingdom, who owetheir  appointments to the King himself.   On this interpretation two important points arise.  In the first place, if at the Conference the United Kingdom Delegationrepresented that  the Dominion Ministers are not  His Majesty&apos;s Ministers,  theDominion Ministers would certainly enquire whose Ministers then are we ? To thatenquiry Lord Stamfordham  no doubt would like the answer  to be to  the effect that dominion Ministers are  responsible only to the Governor-General and in no way owetheir appointments to the King.  This attitude, however, would be quite inconsistent with the declaration regarding equal status.    Mr. Thomas thought that it would be very difficult to maintain that  dominion ministers are not His Majesty&apos;s Ministers.  The Prime Minister of Australia, forexample, would argue that, if he was not responsible to the King, he  was  onlyresponsible to  the Australian people who had elected him. He would contend that,after having agreed in 1926 that the Dominions were free and unfettered, the UnitedKingdom now  wished to interpret the arrangement in a restrictive sense.    The second point was this,  that under Lord Stamfordham&apos;s interpretation itwas inevitable that a system of dual advice would arise, and nothing could be morefatal to the unity of  the Crown and of the Empire than such a development.    5.  THE  LORD CHANCELLOR observed  that  the  difficulty was that  thewhole position had been fundamentally altered at  the Imperial Conference of 1926.If the matter was being considered in July 1926 and not in July 1930, he would findhimself very much in agreement with the views which Lord Stamfordham had expressed.   In this connection Lord  Sankey drew attention to the wording of thefollowing paragraph in Section  IV  on page 17 of the  Summary of Proceedings ofthe Imperial Conference, 1926 (Cmd. 2768) :-         &quot; On this point we propose that it should  be placed on record that,  apart    from provisions  embodied  in constitutions or  in specific  statutes  expressly    providing for reservation, it is recognised that it is the right of the Government    of each Dominion to advise the Crown in all matters relating to its own affairs.    Consequently, it would not be  in accordance with constitutional  practice for    advice to  be tendered to His Majesty by  His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great    Britain in any matter appertaining to the affairs  of a Dominion against the    views of the Government of  that Dominion.&apos;&apos;    It seemed to the Lord Chancellor impossible to go back on this statement, and theonly question  that could be argued  was  what precisely was  the  meaning of theexpression &quot; to advise the Crown.&quot;  Does this expression refer to the King himself in Person or to the Governor-General?    It must be asked what was the meaning that  the  Dominions attached to theexpression in 1926, and would they be satisfied with the restricted meaning suggestedby Lord Stamfordham ?  It was  clear that no single Dominion would  agree that theexpression &quot;the Crown&quot; means only the Governor-General.  Could it, indeed, be argued  that in 1926  the representatives of the Government of the United Kingdomattached a different  meaning to the expression to that attached by  the  dominion representatives ?  Moreover,  as indicated in LE.C. (30) 20, this limited interpretationmust lead to the conclusion that there is not one King, but seven Kings.    Much as he sympathised with Lord Stamfordham, the Lord Chancellor felt thatit was quite impracticable to alter the understanding of 1926.    6.  THE  ATTORNEY-GENERAL drew special  attention  to the wording ofSection 14 of  the South Africa  Act, 1909, which provides that the South AfricanMinisters  &quot;shall be members of the Executive Council, and shall be the King&apos;ministers of State for the Union.&quot; In the Commonwealth of Australia ConstitutionAct,  1900, Section 64,  the  Commonwealth Ministers  shall be  &quot;members of  theFederal Executive Council, and shall  be the Queen&apos;s Ministers of  State  for  theCommonwealth.&quot;       [21429]                                                      B 2
     In his, the Attorney-General&apos;s, view it would be impossible constitutionally to-contend that Dominion Ministers are not His Majesty&apos;s Ministers,  and it must always be remembered that it is on their Advice that His Majesty  acts in suchmatters as the ratification of Dominion treaties.     7.  THE LORD CHANCELLOR drew attention to the emphasis laid in 1926on  the necessity for  prior consultation between  the  various Governments  of  theEmpire before important decisions are taken. Much of the difficulty would disappearif machinery could be established which would  secure such consultation taking place as a recognised regular procedure.     8.  LORD STAMFORDHAM said that he had hoped that the Dominions would agree to  Advice being conveyed through His Majesty&apos;s Ministers in London, and,in this connection, he referred to a recent communication from Lord Willingdon, inwhich it was stated that the Prime Minister of Canada was constantly emphasisingto Lord  Willingdon  the importance  &quot;of my retaining in  my hands all matters connected with personal relations to  Flis Majesty, and the necessity  for  me  torecognise that I have nothing to do with the British Government, but only with thatof Canada.&quot;     9.  THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had come to the conclusion that  theDominion Governments wanted to short circuit the United  Kingdom Government,and were trying to devise some new means of access to the Sovereign.   They wishedto ensure that if a Dominion Prime Minister was  present in London he should haveright of access, and they hoped to reach agreement on the procedure to be followedwhen he was not present in London.     He (the Prime Minister) proposed to discuss the whole matter with the dominion prime Ministers  informally  at Lossiemouth.  It was much more  likely  that  anarrangement acceptable to His Majesty and to  all  others concerned could be reached by this means than by more formal discussions in London.     10.  LORD STAMFORDHAM expressed doubts whether a Dominion minister could advise the King, to whom he did not have  access.   He had heard a rumour thatthe  Dominions might propose that the  channel of  advice should be the high commissioners in London.     11.  THE PRIME  MINISTER  and the SECRETARY  OF STATE FORDOMINION AFFAIRS intimated that they and their colleagues  were  entirelyopposed to any such suggestion.     12.  LORD STAMFORDHAM again referred to the difficulty of a Ministertendering advice who had no access to the King.  In present circumstances muchtrouble and confusion resulted from misunderstanding on the part of the public ofthe position under the 1926 Declaration.     13.  THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out  that the Committee&apos;s  legal advisers  were unanimous in thinking that Dominion  Ministers  are  the  King&apos;ministers.  A Dominion Prime Minister might, when in London, claim the rightof direct access, but wdiat should the channel of communication be when he was not present ?   The following had been suggested :      (1) The Governor-General.     (2) The High Commissioner in London.     (3) His  Majesty&apos;s Ministers in London; but on the distinct understanding that          their duty was merely to convey the advice of the Dominion Minister to          the King, and that they were precluded from giving contrary advice.     14.  THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL thought that there  was general agreementwith the view that Dominion Ministers are His Majesty&apos;s Ministers,  and entitledas such to right of access to the King, but  the area over which they tendered  advice to the King should be entirely distinct from and  outside the area over which theytendered  advice to the Governor-General.   It was very desirable that there shouldbe no alteration in the subjects as to which advice  is tendered to-day to His majesty and  the  Governor-General  respectively.   The  Governor-General  was now HisMajesty&apos;s Personal Representative, and on this  ground it was reasonable and properthat His Majesty^ should exercise  a wider discretion in regard to the appointmentof Governors-General  than in the case of other appointments.     15.  THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL  further pointed out that here the  PrimeMinister has access to the King.   If a Dominion  Prime Minister had access on the
same subject both to the Governor-General and to the King, it might be possible, ineffect, for such a Minister to appeal to the King  from a decision of the Governor-General.   This might give rise to a situation of great embarrassment.    16.   THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES was of opinionthat the appointment of a Governor-General was not a matter which only concerned the particular Dominion.    17.   THE PRIME MINISTER felt some doubt whether it could be successfullymaintained that  the  United Kingdom was more  interested in the appointment of(say) the Governor-General of Australia than was Newfoundland.   On the otherhand, could it be suggested that it was not open to the King, who was very intimatelyand personally interested in the appointment, to  consult with the Prime Ministerhere ?    18.   THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL  thought that His Majesty  was entitledto take counsel on such matters with  whomsoever he chooses.   In view of the entirely new situation  resulting from the Imperial  Conference of 1926, the old precedentswere no longer applicable.   The appointment of a Governor-General  was not amatter in which  advice in the technical sense could be tendered.   The decision insuch cases was EEis Majesty&apos;s decision, who must be entitled to determine who his personal Representative should be.    19.   THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it must  be  agreed that theDominion Prime Minister would be responsible for the advice.  Before accepting orrejecting that advice His Majesty would be fully entitled to insist on an opportunityfor consultation with some other person or  persons in  whom he had confidence, but such persons would not give &quot; advice  &quot; in the technical sense.    20.   THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS said thatthe Dominions would object to  intervention by Downing Street.  The best line totake with them would be to  agree that there should be no such intervention, while at the same time insisting on His Majesty being entirely free to consult with whoeverhe  likes.    21.   LORD  STAMFORDHAM inquired when in future the King appointed a Governor-General who would be constitutionally responsible for the appointment?    22.   THE PRIME MINISTER replied that  the responsibility would rest withthe Dominion Prime  Minister concerned.   It was essential, however, to secure thatthe Dominions should   all  agree  to adopt the well-established United Kingdomprocedure under  which the King is  consulted informally in regard to  the proposedappointee, and no name is actually  submitted to him for formal approval until theKing&apos;&quot;s informal approval has been received.    23.   In this connection reference was made to the recent correspondence betweenthe Prime Minister and Mr. Scullin regarding the appointment  of a successor toLord Stonehaven as Governor-General of the Commonwealth, in the course of which mr. MacDonald had  informed Mr. Scullin that the &quot; essential  points in relation toHis Majesty appeared to be     (1)  that no name should be formally submitted without having been informally           approved  by His Majesty beforehand;    (2)  that  it was  within  His Majesty&apos;s right  to  reject any name suggested           informally, or to suggest  another himself; and    (3)  that there should ,be complete  freedom of consultation and discussion up to           the point where a formal  recommendation was made and approved.&quot;    24.   THE  PRIME  MINISTER  summarised  the  proposals  contained  in EegenoyandLEG. (30) 21, regarding Regency and Cognate Questions.  After pointing out that ?gn,legislation  would  be necessary in  the United  Kingdom  and  (probably) in theDominion  Parliaments, Mr. MacDonald  drew  special attention  to  the  questiondiscussed on pages 4 and 5 of LEG. (30) 21, whether there should be any, and if so what, limitations on the powers of  the Regent.    The Committee had come to theconclusion  that it would be impossible in  present circumstances  to contemplate a situation in which there would be no one capable of exercising the Royal Power to dissolve Parliament or to create peers.
             25.  LORD STAMFORDHAM said that it appeared to him that the arrange-         ments made in 1928 constituted a wise and satisfactory solution of a very difficult         problem.             26.  THE  PRIME  MINISTER  intimated  the  reasons which had led  the         Committee to the view that it would be impracticable and undesirable to deal with a         future emergency by means of the procedure adopted in 1928.             27.  LORD STAMFORDHAM thanked the Prime Minister and his colleagues         for the explanations that had been given, and stated that he would report  the         discussion to His Majesty.             28.  THE  PRIME MINISTER said that if there was any point which Lord         Stamfordham wished to discuss the Committee would be glad to confer with him on         some future occasion.wext          29.

    1.  THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS requested the Committee to authorise him to invite the Dominion and Indian Delegations to bethe guests of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom for the duration ofthe Conference.  This arrangement would  follow the precedents of previous imperial conferences  and provision had been made to meet  the  expense, which would becharged  to  the  Government  Hospitality Fund,  and  would  not  involve  a supplementary Estimate.    THE COMMITTEE  approved the  suggestion of the Secretary of State  forDominion Affairs, and authorised him to proceed accordingly.    2.  With reference to LEU. (30) 7th Conclusions 7,  THE COMMITTEE had before them a  Note  prepared by the  Departments  mainly concerned, entitled&quot; Preliminary Draft Agenda and Notes on Procedure &quot; (Paper LEU. (30) 27).    (a) Some discussion took  place regarding the proposals in paragraphs 6 and 7of LEU. (30) 27 relative to the Chairmanship of the Conference.  On the one hand,it was pointed out that hitherto the Chair at Plenary Meetings had always beentaken by the principal United Kingdom Delegate, and that a plan under which theChairman  changed  at  each  Meeting  would   cause  considerable  administrativeinconvenience.  On the other hand, the Committee were informed  that a suggestionsuch as that the Chair should be taken in rotation would likely to be welcomed by theDominions;   from the. point of view of &quot;equal  status,&quot; the psychological effect ofsuch a suggestion would be valuable.  It  was very improbable that in practice  theDominion Heads of  Delegations would  desire to take  advantage of the  suggestion,but it would obviously be preferable that the suggestion should come voluntarily fromthe United Kingdom Delegation rather than that it should be raised  independentlyby some Dominion, in which case it would have  to be accepted.    THE COMMITTEE agreed-         That the question of the Appointment of the Chairman of the  Conference         should be placed  on  the Agenda and that arrangements should be made         informally with a view, if possible, to securing that the Prime Minister is         chosen as permanent Chairman of the Conference.    (b) The   Committee  adopted  the   proposal  contained  in   paragraph  8of I.E.C. (30) 27 that it should be suggested to the Conference that each DominionDelegation should provide  a Chairman for a Committee or Sub-Committee.    (c) In connection with paragraph 9 of I.E.C. (30) 27,  reference was made to thequestion of broadcasting, and it was agreed          That a telegram  should  be sent forthwith  to the  Dominions  and India         intimating  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government  in the United Kingdom were         disposed  to consider  favourably  the broadcasting of speeches delivered at         the opening Plenary Session of the Conference, pointing out, however, that         this would necessarily mean the imposition of a time limit (say 10 minutes)         on each speaker, and inviting the views of the Dominions and India on  the         proposal.    (d) Some discussion took place on paragraph 10 of LEU. (30) 27, in the courseof which it was agreed that there should be circulated by  the Secretary of State  forForeign Affairs a statement on foreign affairs, but that no special statements shouldbe circulated respecting Great Britain, India or the Colonial Empire.*  It was also agreed that,  in his opening address to  the Conference, the Prime Minister shouldmake a brief reference to the progress of  the Colonial  Empire since 1926.    (e) The Committee adopted the proposals contained in paragraphs 11 and 12 ofLEU. (30) 27.    (/) With regard to publicity (paragraph 13), the Committee agreed to invitethe Secretary  of State for  Dominion  Affairs  to  supervise  and  take general responsibility for the publicity arrangements of the Conference.    ig) The  Prime  Minister asked that materials for his opening Address to  theConference should be prepared by the Departments concerned (paragraph 14).    * The Notes at the head of Part II of the Preliminary Draft Agenda  (I.E.C.

    (h)  The Committee adopted paragraphs 15-17 of I.E.C. (30) 27, and agreed to request  the  Secretary  of State for Dominion Affairs, in  consultation with  thePresident of  the Board of Trade, to be responsible  for the arrangements  for  thePlenary Session to be devoted to the general discussion on Economic questions andthe organisation of the economic work of the Conference.                    1   &apos;    (i) With  regard to paragraph 18 of I.E.C. (30)  27, THE  committee agreed     (1)  That the Admiralty should be authorised to arrange for the Delegations to          visit the Fleet on Saturday, the 1st  November, 1930.    (2)  That the visits of the Dominion Delegations to provincial industrial centres          should take place on the 6th, 7th and 8th November.    (j)  With  regard to the preliminary draft Agenda for the  Conference,  theCommittee requested the Departments concerned  to  prepare for  consideration, ascheme  showing what Committees it would be  necessary for  the Conference-ence toappoint, and  the subjects to be assigned to those  Committees respectively.    THE PRIME MINISTER expressed the hope that as many as possible of  thebriefs mentioned in the Note attached to I.E.C.  (30)  27  might be circulated beforethe end of the present week, and that every effort should  be made to expedite  theproduction of the briefs for Ministers on the  economic  subjects,  with the  view totheir consideration at the Committee&apos;s next meeting.    In  this  connection the Prime Minister drew attention to the  need  for preparation of material at an early date on such matters as Import Boards and BulkPurchases.    The Prime Minister expressed the opinion that it would be  necessary at a later stage to bring the economic documents, including economic briefs for  Ministers, tothe notice of  the Cabinet.    3.   THE  COMMITTEE  had before them a Note  by the Joint Secretaries Proposed(I.E.C. (30) 25) covering a Memorandum by the Inter-Departmental  Committee on Meetings!Economic Questions, suggesting that the proposed meetings on  statistics  should be postponed, and that the Conference should consider the question of arranging thatsuch meetings should fake place on a future date.THE COMMITTEE agreed-    To approve the proposals contained in the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s    Memorandum, and to cruthorise  the despatch to the Dominions of the    telegrams in the form of the drafts marked &quot;A&quot; and &quot; B &quot;  attached  to    that Memorandum, *subject to the addition of the words &quot; and India &quot;  in    the fourth line after the word &quot; Dominions.&quot;*            *....*  NOTE. Since the conclusion of the Meeting the Secretary        of State  for Dominion Affairs, the Secretary of State for  India, and the        President of the Board of Trade have agreed to this  alteration.    4.   THE  COMMITTEE had before them a Note by the Joint Secretaries Canadian(Paper  I.E.C.  (30)  26) covering  a Memorandum  by the  Inter-Departmental a^AgencCommittee  On  Economic  Questions  regarding the proposals of  the canadian government for the Agenda of the Conference.    THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR  DOMINION  AFFAIRS  emphasised the undesirability of the question of  the promotion of  Seamen&apos;s welfare  in portsbeing raised at the Conference, having regard to the fact that it is an Internationalrather than an Imperial question, and  also that it is already under consideration bythe International Labour Conference.THE COMMITTEE agreed-    To  approve  the  proposal  of  the  Inter-Departmental Committee  on    Economic Questions that a  telegram on the lines of that marked &quot; C &quot;    attached to the Memorandum, should be despatched  to  Canada, and that
copies of both telegrams &quot; A &quot;  and &quot; C &quot; should be repeated to the otherDominions.    NOTE. Since  the  conclusion of the Meeting  of the Committee theSecretary of State for India has requested  that at the end of the draft telegram marked &quot; C &quot; the words &quot; and India &quot; should be added, and thattelegrams &quot;A&quot; and &quot; B &quot;  should be repeated to India as well as to theDominions.    The Secretary of State for  Dominion Affairs and the President of theBoard of Trade have accepted  the proposal of the Secretary of State forIndia, and steps are being taken to amend the draft telegrams accordingly.Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,   July 15, 1930.

imperial conference and EconomicConference,1930.PolicyCommittee.Agenda forConferenceandProcedure.              1.  WITH reference to I.E.C. 9th Conclusions 2 (a), the Committee had before         them a Note (I.E.C. (30) 47) by the Dominions Office covering draft telegrams (A and         B) to the Dominions dealing respectively with procedure at the Conference and a         public announcement as to the Agenda.  The  Committee approved amendments to         the telegrams to the following effect:               To telegram A                   At the end of third paragraph add-                       &apos;&apos; say not more than ten minutes,  which would consume about one hour                      and a half, and that each speech should be written out.beforehand.&quot;              To telegram B                   Paragraph 2,  line 10, before &quot;disputes&quot; insert  &quot;Inter-Imperial.&quot;                  Paragraph 2, line 12, after &quot; cognate  &quot; to insert &quot; and arising from.&quot;                  Paragraph 3, line 8, delete &quot; the.&quot;              The attention of the Committee  was specially directed to  the  inclusion in         paragraph 2  of &quot; nationality &quot;  as a question to be placed on  the Agenda.   The         Committee were reminded that the Inter-Departmental Committee on Inter-Imperial         Relations had reached the conclusion that the general aspects of this question were         certain to be rai sed at the Conference in connection with sub j ects such as &apos;&apos; married         women,&quot; &quot; deportation &quot; and &quot; commercial treaties,&quot; but that the Attorney-General         had  expressed some doubt as to the desirability of proposing the definite inclusion         of the general question.              It was represented that it was very desirable that the Government should decide         in advance on their policy in regard to the  1&apos; nationality &apos;&apos; question as a whole, and         then apply  that policy to each separate aspect of the  question as it  arose at the         Conference.              THE COMMITTEE agreed-              (1) To approve the despatch forthwith  to the Dominions and India of telegrams                    in the form of drafts A and B, attached to I.E.C. (30) 47, subject to the                    modifications indicated above.              (2) To  request the Lord Chancellor  to preside over a special Sub-Committee,                    to prepare a further Brief for the use of United Kingdom Ministers, on                    the whole question of nationality.Form of         2.  THE COMMITTEE had before them a Report by the Inter-Departmentalsignature and Committee on Inter-Imperial Relations on the form of Preamble, Signature andEatification  Ratification of Treaties (I.E.C. (30) 28).  For convenience of reference the Summaryof Treaties.  an(^  Conclusions of this Report are attached, see Appendix I.              THE COMMITTEE adopted the conclusions set out in paragraphs (1), (2) and         (3) of the Summary.              With regard to the suggestion in paragraph (4) of the Summary, it was generally         agreed that there was little or no prospect that the Irish Free State would abandon         the  recital in their instruments of ratification of the phrases referred  to in that         paragraph.  Doubts, moreover, were expressed as to whether good would result from         raising at the Conference the suggested question of principle, viz., that  changes of         procedure of this character should only be made as a result of  consultation and         agreement.   The only effect of raising the question might be to cause other  Dominions         to unite with the  Irish Free State  in demanding similar or even greater  departures         from the standard form.   On the other hand, it was urged that the Irish  Free  State         would find it difficult to persuade the Conference to adopt their view on the question         of principle and  that even if no agreement was  reached the position would  be no         worse than at present.              THE COMMITTEE  agreed-                  That in the first instance the problem should  be  discussed confidentially              with the Irish Free State delegation.   This discussion should proceed on the              basis  that  it  is admitted  that complete  uniformity  of  procedure  cannot be              insisted upon, and that the  inclusion of reference to the Ministerial advice on              which His  Majesty acts could not be resisted if the point were pressed.;
        References  to parliamentary  approval  were,  however,  in  a different    category.   It was by no means certain that other of His Majesty&apos;s Governments    would agree to the inclusion of such references or, at any rate, of references to    approval of both Houses of Parliament.  Hence insistence on  the inclusion of    such references was bound to have reactions elsewhere.        This should be pointed out to the Free State representatives and it should    be urged that it was desirable that every effort should be made  to secure that    changes of procedure of the kind in question should only be effected as the result    of consultation and agreement.        If no solution on this basis can be found, the question of raising the issue    at the Conference  should be further considered.    3.  THE  COMMITTEE had under  consideration a  Note by the Secretary of statute ofState for Dominion Affairs (I.E.C. (30) 22) covering (inter alia) a draft Bill to giveeffect to the recommendations of the Report of the Dominion Legislation Conferencein so far  as  they are designed to  secure  complete  legislative freedom for  theDominions.    The Committee discussed  the question whether  the Addresses to His Majestymentioned  in  the  recital  in square  brackets on page 2  of  the  draft should be presented before or after the introduction of the Bill in the Parliament of the UnitedKingdom.   If the latter, then difficulties might arise from  the fact that a Bill whichhas passed through all  its  stages cannot be suspended, but  must be presented for  theRoyal Assent on the first opportunity.  On the other hand, the former alternative would mean that the hands of Parliament would be tied in advance, and it was doubtful whether Parliament would assent to such a proposition.    With a view to avoiding these difficulties, it was suggested that agreement withregard to  the  terms  of the Bill should be  reached informally  at the ImperialConference, and that the Addresses should contain no reference to the draft Bill,  but should merely ask that legislative effect should be  given  to the conclusions of  theConference.  It was also  suggested that,  if  possible, the assent of the opposition parties to the proposed legislation should be obtained in advance.    THE COMMITTEE  agreed-    (1)  That the procedure outlined  in the preceding paragraph in regard to  the           Addresses should be adopted, and that the recital  on page 2 of the Bill           should be amended accordingly.    (2)  That Ministers should confer in regard to the question  of  obtaining  the           agreement of the Opposition Parties to the proposed legislation.    (3)  That the title of the Bill to be proposed at the Imperial Conference should           be &quot; The Statute of Westminster.&quot;    (4)  That the question of the insertion in section 1 (2)  of the date  as from which           the  Act is to become operative should be considered in connection with           the  Memorandum  to  be  circulated  regarding  Discipline  of   the           Forces, &amp;c.    4.  THE  COMMITTEE had before  them a Report of the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee on  Inter-Imperial Relations  on  &quot; The  System  of Communication  and consultation between His Majesty&apos;s Governments&quot; (I.E.C.  (30) 31).    The Committee adopted the suggestions and conclusions set out in the Summaryto that Report, which reads as follows :                                     &quot;Summary.        To sum up, it seems to us that the general principles of information  and     consultation  as  at present laid down are the best that can be devised  in  the    circumstances;  they require  to be better understood  and  applied in  the    Dominions rather than amended.  The application of them in practice is bound     to lead to difficulties; of these difficulties some are inherent in the very nature    of the Commonwealth; others, it may be hoped, may grow less with the passage of     time  and  the growth  in the Dominions of experience in the conduct of foreign     affairs.  In the circumstances,  we recommend that at the Imperial Conference     it should be pointed  out to the Dominion Representatives that  His  Majesty&apos;s     Government  in the  United Kingdom  are at  pains  to give  the  Dominion     Governments the earliest possible information as to any negotiations which they     contemplate with foreign countries, and that it is only reasonable that Dominion     Governments  should give the  United  Kingdom Government  corresponding       [21443]                                                       B 2

We  suggest  that in this    connection stress should be laid on the fact that a contrary procedure,  apart    from embarrassing the United Kingdom negotiators, may  well give to foreign    countries an impression of disunity among the Members of the British Common-    wealth at a time when it is most important to emphasise their unity of purpose    and  action if negotiations are to reach a successful conclusion.&quot;    5.  THE COMMITTEE approved the despatch to the Governments  of SouthAfrica and  New  Zealand of the Telegrams  in the  form of the drafts annexed toI.E.C. (30) 29.    6.  THE COMMITTEE accepted the  recommendation in the  Memorandum(I.E.C. (30) 9B) of the Inter-Departmental Committee of Inter-Imperial Relations,entitled &quot; Channels of Communication between Dominion Governments and ForeignCountries,&quot; that the heading          &quot;matters relating to civilian flights on recognised inter-national air routes,&quot;should be inserted in paragraph 12 of Memorandum IV of           (I.E.C. (30) 9)between the headings &quot; Facilities  for British subjects belonging to the dominions in visiting foreign countries &quot; and &quot; Legislation and Certification of Documents.&quot;    7.  In pursurance of I.E.C. (30) 7th Conclusions 5, THE COMMITTEE had before them a Memorandum by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Inter-imperial relations, prepared for  circulation  to the  Dominion  Governments  on  matters connected with the form of Commercial Treaties (I.E.C.  (30) 40).    The  Committee approved the Memorandum  in  question for circulation to theDominion and Indian Delegations on arrival in the United Kingdom.    8.  THE COMMITTEE adopted  the Report  (I.E.C. (30) 41)  of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Inter-Imperial  Relations  on &quot;Personal  Rights&quot; for!&quot; British  Subjects &quot; in the Commercial Treaties.  For  convenience of reference a!copy of the Summary and Conclusions in this Report is attached, see Appendix II. &apos;    9.  With reference to I.E.C.  (30), 8th Conclusions, THE COMMITTEE are agreed to request the Legal  Sub-Committee  to prepare,  for their consideration, aMemorandum on Regency and Cognate  Questions in a form suitable for circulation to the Dominions and India.    The  Committee also agreed that no Memorandum on Advice to the Crown onDominion matters should be circulated to the Dominions and India.    10.   THE  COMMITTEE  had   before  them a  Note  by the Secretary(I.E.C. (30)  30), covering a Memorandum prepared by the Air Staff for the  ImperialConference on Air Power and Imperial Defence.    The  Committee took  note that the Chief of the Naval Staff  and the Chief of theImperial General Staff, while agreeing to the circulation of the paper, do not wish itto be assumed that they agree to all possible inferences which may be drawn from itscontents.    THE COMMITTEE agreed-    (1) That the Memorandum should bear the title  &quot; Air Power and  Imperial^          Defence,&quot; as printed.    (2) To approve the Memorandum in question for circulation to the Dominion]          and Indian Delegations on arrival in the United Kingdom.    11.   THE COMMITTEE were informed as to the arrangements in operation]for the preparation of Memoranda and Briefs for Ministers on  Economic questions the  Prime  Minister hoped  that  it would be possible  for the  Chancellor of thejExchequer to attend future  Meetings at  which  economic documents raising largquestions of policy are under consideration, and  stated that Ministers who are not members  of the  Committee  would be specially invited to attend when questions concerning their Departments are under consideration.    In this  connection, reference was made to the Memorandum (I.E.C. (30) 45) orBulk  Purchase of Dominion Produce, and Sir S.  Chapman was  requested to arrangefor the preparation by his Inter-Departmental Committee of a further comprehensive
Memorandum on this subject, in which the facts should be set out and the differentDepartmental views regarding the policy should be fully stated.    12.  THE  COMMITTEE  agreed to postpone consideration of  the  followingitems on the Agenda to the next meeting, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer andother Ministers concerned could be present:     Bulk  Purchase of Dominion Produce.  I.E.C. (30) 45.    Imperial Trade Policy and Imperial Economic Machinery.   I.E.C. (30) 32.    Double Income Tax Relief within the Empire.  I.E.C. (30) 43.

APPENDIX  I.SUMMARY OF  CONCLUSIONS.Extract from      37.   Xo SUH1 UD :-I.E.O. (SO) 28.                    1    (1) We examine  the various forms of preamble  used in bilateral instruments and show why the 1926 form &quot; For Great Britain and Northern Ireland,  all british colonies and Protectorates, and all Mandated Areas  administered by His Government  in  Great Britain &quot; has  been shortened in most cases to  &quot; For Great  Britainand Northern Ireland.&quot;  These bilateral instruments being, however, of primaryconcern only to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, we do not thinkit necessary to obtain formal approval of the procedure  employed in these cases atthe Imperial Conference (paragraph 11).    (2) We examine  the  problem which  has been created by  the introduction of separate ratifications  in lieu of one single instrument in respect of all parts of theEmpire covered by the treaty  in its particular relation to the simultaneous depositof the separate ratifications.  After examining  the correspondence connected withthe Paris Peace Pact and the Poison Gas  Protocol,  we recommend that, in viewof the difficulty of defining cases when simultaneous deposit would be advisable, thisquestion should not be raised at the Imperial Conference (paragraph 18).    We  note that the ratification article in  the recent London Naval Treaty was,at the request of certain Dominions, made to read : &quot;In respect of each and all ofthe members  of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&quot;  Analogous cases in thefuture are, however, likely to be rare (paragraph 19).    (3) We examine two recent cases where  there has been a difference  of opinon as to  whether His Majesty&apos;s  ratifications or Governmental ratifications should beemployed.  We think that, although it might be  possible to suggest at  the forthcoming Conference that in the case of all international instruments not definitely inthe inter-Governmental form the procedure of ratification by His Majesty would be appropriate,  yet we are very  doubtful whether  such  a suggestion would command general acceptance.  In the circumstances it is doubtful whether there would be any advantage in raising the question (paragraph 27).    (4) We examine the problem created by the desire  of the  Irish  Free State torecite in  their instruments of ratification the phrases (i) &apos;&apos; And whereas the Dail andSeanad of Our Irish Free State have  approved of the said Treaty,&quot;  and (ii)&quot; Whereas the Executive Council of the Irish Free State have advised Us to ratify the aforesaid Treaty in respect of Our Irish Free  State.&quot;  We recognise that it isnot possible to insist on complete uniformity of procedure in matters of this kind,but we attach great importance to the principle that changes of this nature should only be made as a result of consultation and agreement, and we therefore recommendthat  this question should  be raised at the Imperial Conference and  an  endeavourmade to secure general agreement that,  while complete uniformity in matters of this nature is not essential, it is most important that any changes of substance inestablished procedure should only be made as a result of a process of consultation and agreement (paragraph 36).APPENDIX II.                                   SUMMARY AND  CONCLUSIONS.extracts from      25.   To Sum Up :-I.E.C (30) 41.                   r              (i) After pointing out that the problem of obtaining personal rights for all          British subjects of whatever origin in commercial treaties is of old standing, and          recording the recommendation  of  the  Inter-departmental  Committee in  1926, we          examine some recent cases in which this problem has again arisen (paragraphs 1 to 6).              (ii)  We draw attention to the fact that whereas in 1926 it appeared that foreign          Governments were not alive to the  point, since that date China, Turkey and Soviet
Russia have become fully aware of the implications involved.  But we note also that,so far, it has not been necessary to make any concession in the direction of limiting the categories of British subjects on whose behalf the benefits of the treaty could be claimed (paragraphs 7 to 10).    (iii) We then discuss the factors which must  be taken into consideration in solving the practical problem, which resolves itself into :     (1)  Should present practice be maintained&apos;    (2)  If present practice is not, or cannot be, maintained, what procedure should           be adopted  (paragraphs 11 to 16) 1    (iv) As a result of this  examination we  recommend  the  maintenance of  thepresent  practice of obtaining benefits for all subjects of His  Majesty,  and  thedesirability of  His Majesty&apos;s  Governments  in the  Dominions adopting a similarpolicy (paragraph 17).    (v)  We point out that the procedure to be adopted, if for any reason maintenanceof the present practice is found  impossible,  will depend  largely  upon the solutionfound for the nationality problem.   We  are not convinced,  however, that even were all  the  Dominions to  define  by law  special  categories  of British subjects as constituting  their &quot;nationals,&quot;  foreign Governments would  necessarily  wish to exclude British subjects merely by reason of connexion with  the Dominions, and theymight be willing to agree to  an exclusion limited to such British subjects as are connected with those Dominions  who do not grant  reciprocal treatment.   We  are,therefore, of the opinion that in such cases it would  be  best not  to  vary thephraseology of that part of the treaty which confers the benefits on the subjects orcitizens of the High Contracting Parties, but to deal with this particular aspect by aseparate article or instrument (paragraphs  18 to 20).    (vi) We have also examined the problem as  it would affect the position of British ubjects connected with other parts of  the Empire, and  we  point out  that  any modification  of the existing  practice  might  add  to  our  difficulties  in treaty negotiations  with  foreign Powers   in  respect  of  other   parts of  the  Empire(paragraphs 21  and 22).    (vii) We have also examined the analogous problem of obtaining benefits for all british ships, and we recommend that in  this case also an endeavour should be made;o obtain  benefits for  ships  registered in  any part of  His Majesty&apos;s Dominions^paragraphs 23 and 24).o
