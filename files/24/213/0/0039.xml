,  THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJBSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1930.SECRET.                                                     COPY NO.  77CP. 234 (30).CABINET.AGRICULTURAL  POLICY.        MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.    I AM of opinion that  no agricultural policy will be permanently  successfulunless     (1)  it makes land much more freely available for cultivation than at present          with security of tenure on fair terms;    (2)  it emancipates the producer from the present desolating uncertainty as to-          price both in the home  market and in  competition, particularly with          bounty-fed imports;    (3)  it develops organisation within the industry on a self-supporting basis and          fosters improved methods, both  of production and  of marketing;    (4)  it pays due regard to the needs of the workers.    The following proposals are designed to secure these results :                                    PART  I.          LAND FOR CULTIVATION  AND DEMONSTRATION.1.  Holdings for Small Cultivators Permanent Scheme.    There is a large unsatisfied demand for small  holdings, cottage holdings andallotments which, for various reasons, is not being met by Local Authorities.  In my view, therefore      (i)  it  is essential that  the  Ministry should be  empowered  to  acquire (if           necessary, compulsorily) and manage  land  for small holdings and allot-           ments (see Appendix I);     (ii)  the Ministry should be empowered to make advances to its tenants towards           the capital  required for  the  proper working  of  their holding (see           Appendix IV);    (iii)  the powers to provide cottage holdings for sale now vested in  County           Councils should be extended to County Borough Councils.  These holdings           should, moreover, be available for letting  as well as sale, and for a wider           class  of applicant (see Appendix I).2.  Holdings for  Small Cultivators Emergency Scheme.    The  direct contribution which land settlement can make towards the solution ofthe unemployment problem is  necessarily limited.  The Ministry should, however,be empowered to provide (if necessary, through suitable agencies) holdings notexceeding 5 acres for unemployed workers for poultry keeping and market gardening,together with bare land allotments up to 1 acre.  Working capital would be requiredfor these persons (see Appendices II and IV).      [21363]                        -                                 B
3.  Large-Scale Farming and Demonstration Farms.    There is definite need for extending the possibilities of large-scale  farming inthis country.  The Ministry  should be authorised to set up an Agricultural LandUtilisation Corporation with a capital of, say,  1,000,000, which would be empoweredto  acquire land by  purchase or  lease,  if  necessarj&apos;,  compulsorily, and  to conductlarge-scale and demonstration farm enterprises.  Further development could be met by loans on mortgage and by utilisation of possible profits.  Details  are elaboratedin Appendices III and IV.4.  Legislative Proposals.    An outline of the legislative provisions which would be necessary to give effectto  the above proposals will be found in Appendix V.                                  PART  II.                        PRICES  AND  MARKETING.1.  The Marketing of Cereals.    The position is dominated by our Free Trade policy and by a number of treaties. ICereals are particularly susceptible to foreign competition, which is intensified inmany cases by export bounties.  The rapid decrease in cereal acreage is upsetting thebalance of the  farming industry as a whole, and is disorganising the  market forother agricultural commodities.   Wheat is generally regarded as the key crop and demands special consideration.    The question of  Foreign Treaties  was explored by an  Inter-DepartmentalCommittee, whose report was circulated to the  Cabinet as CP. 91  (30).   The LawOfficers might be invited, as therein suggested, to consider what action, if any, suchas countervailing duties, is open to us under existing treaties to deal with bounty-fedimports.  / further recommend  that the  Cabinet  issue  definite instructions thatfreedom to deal with  such imports should  be preserved in all future treaties, andthat we announce that this has been done.     Consistent with our treaty obligations  as at present interpreted and  our generalpolicy, there are only  two ways in which we can give  the much needed security tothe home producer, viz. : (a) Import Boards, or (b) a system which secures a definiteshare in the home market for  the home producer.         (a) Import Boards.     I remain convinced that  we must inevitably come  to the Labour policy in thismatter.  I  recognise existing Parliamentary limitations, but in order to prepare the way, / suggest that the principle should1 be considered&apos; by the Cabinet forthwithwith a view to an announcement that the  Government will submit this question tothe forthcoming  Imperial Conference.     The  proposed Wheat  Quota  and the Agricultural Marketing Bill are not inconsistent with, but will facilitate,, an Import Board policy.         (b) Guaranteed Home Market for Cereals.     (i) Wheat. Proposals for a wheat quota have been subjected to the most careful scrutiny.  I am satisfied that the plan outlined in Appendix VI, which is conditional on the establishment of a Producers&apos; Wheat Marketing Board under the Agricultural Marketing Bill,, is practicable, will secure to the home grower without cost to the Exchequer a minimum price for  wheat  of  millable quality, will maintain the principle  of  free  imports,  and  safeguard  the  consumer.   I  recommend that the principle  be accepted and authority  given for  the preparation  of a Bill. Concurrent legislation will be necessary in Northern Ireland.      (ii) Barley. A  preliminary examination  suggests  that  a quota,  for malting barley might be practicable, and I recommend that it  should be announced that we propose to explore its possibilities.
     (in) Oats.-I have already recommended that the Law Officers should be invitedto consider our Treaty position with regard to countervailing duties which wouldprovide a possible method of dealing with imported bounty-fed oats.  Imported oatsare almost entirely used for feeding to stock, and are only a small proportion of thetotal supply.     An alternative expedient which is probably consistent with our  Treaty obliga-tions is that which has been adopted by Sweden of staining imported oats.  I think this idea might be explored.2. A agricultural Marketing Bill.     This Bill authorises  the  creation of ad hoc commodity marketing boards foragricultural products, with State financial assistance and with power over minoritiesof producers.  It contemplates  the  preparation by the producers  themselves  ofschemes either national or local  for individual  commodities, which, after considera-tion by the Minister and submission to Parliament, would  have  statutory  force.Particular  regard has  been paid to the provision of adequate safeguards&apos; for theprotection both of the small producer  and of the consumer.  A draft Bill, which hasbeen revised as the result of agreement with the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Attorney-General, is annexed as Appendix  VII, which also includes a statementof recent changes. It is subject to the addition of a Scottish adaptation clause nowin course of preparation to implement this agreement.3. Abattoirs. .     Apart from  considerations of public health,  the old-fashioned methods still invogue in this country in connection with slaughtering and the preparation of meat for sale constitute a severe handicap to the development of the Ministry&apos;s Marketingpolicy.  I therefore recommend that we should announce that local authorities will beinvited to take advantage of the financial facilities available  in  connection&apos; with unemployment works to increase and  improve the provision of public abattoirs.                                  PART III.        THE IMPROVEMENT OE AGRICULTURAL  METHODS.     Adequate provision for the improvement  of technical methods  of production should form an important part of our policy.  We should, therefore,  press  forwardschemes for the development of agricultural education and research,  the prevention and control of disease, and the improvement of live-stock.(a) Education.     Schemes for a considerable  development of  the work of County agricultural education Committees, submitted in response to the Governments recent invitation,should  be  accorded favourable  consideration, and plans  for tihe  extension  ofveterinary education and  of general and technical, instruction for adult workers  onDanish lines  should be  pressed forward to completion.     The facilities provided at  Agricultural Colleges are now under  review  by a departmental Committee, upon  whose report further  action  will  no doubt  berequired.(b) Research.     The co-ordination of  agricultural  research  work throughout  the  UnitedKingdom, with  due regard to  the requirements of the  Empire overseas, will  beeffected by  the new Agricultural Research Council now being constituted.  Amongthe  first subjects to  receive  attention  should be  the development  of veterinaryresearch.(c) Animal and Plant  Diseases.     Such further steps as from time to time prove desirable and practicable shouldbe taken to protect the farmer from loss owing  to animal and plant diseases;lj       [21363]                                                       &apos; B  2

-(d)  Improvement of Live-stock.    Legislation should be introduced to regulate the use and importation of bulls.This step has been strongly advocated by the Councils of Agriculture for Englandand Wales and by certain important sections of the agricultural community. It isnecessary, not  only to improve our  stock, but to prevent its deterioration,  by  thedumping here of bulls which have been refused licences in Ireland, where a scheme ofthis kind is in operation.                                 PART  IV.                      THE AGRICULTURAL WORKER.    Our agricultural programme would be incomplete unless it included proposalsfor the direct benefit  of agricultural workers.  A special effort should therefore bemade to deal with (a) Unemployment Insurance and (b) the  tied cottage.(a)  Unemployment Insurance.    A Bill for the application of unemployment insurance to  agricultural workers on special terms should be introduced as soon as possible.  Negotiations between theMinister of Labour and the workers&apos;  organisations are, I understand, well advanced.Delay in making an announcement of our intentions will cause great disappointment.(b)  Rural Housing.    The present Housing Bill contains  provisions which should mitigate the evil ofthe tied cottage.  As soon as it becomes law I suggest that an active campaign shouldbe organised in rural areas  to stimulate the erection of  free cottages, and to speedup  the  survey leading to  the replacement of  slum  properties,  concentrating in thefirst instance on those occupied by agricultural workers.    I attach the greatest  importance to an early announcement of the principles ofour Policy.          &apos; /  fM:MM     &apos;                          &apos;1           -     %A&apos;    Ministry of A griculture and Fisheries,           10,  Whitehall Place, S.W.I.

Permanent Scheme.                      (A.)- Small Holdings and Allotments.    1.  Agriculture is not one, but many industries, and some clearly are holdingtheir own, if not actually prosperous.   Although small holders have been badly hit insome districts, there is still a large unsatisfied demand, and whenever suitable landbecomes available, a considerable local demand, hitherto undisclosed,  immediatelyarises.  Through small holdings, also, a large  number of men have been given their first chance, and are now successful farmers.    2.  The provision of land on a scale more modest than that of a small holding,within reach of men&apos;s homes, has been shown in the case of Leicester, Sheffield, andother cities to provide an opportunity that has been eagerly made use of.   The most successful of these large-scale allotment  undertakings seem to owe their success tothe provision of help and  organisation through a  local  agency, which is capable ofdealing on the one hand with the providing authority, and, on the other, helping bymeans of information  and, in some cases, of loans in the provision of seeds, plants,material, tools, &amp;c.    3.  The provision of  small holdings and  cottage holdings by County Councilsunder  the Small Holdings and Allotments  Act, 1926, and of allotments by various local authorities under the Allotments Act, is proceeding very slowly.   The Ministryof Agriculture has no direct power under the law to provide land for such  purposes,and it should be empowered to acquire (if necessary, compulsorily) and manage landin order to provide such holdings and allotments where local authorities are failing to supply the existing demand.  These powers would be  in addition to and  not in substitution of those  granted to local authorities  under the Acts mentioned.    4.  Sound policy  as well as economy indicate  that we should  encourage tenantsto provide additional equipment for themselves so  far as possible.  This necessitatestwo things :      (i) Reasonable security of tenure;     (ii) The establishment of reliable local machinery for the supervision of credit           to  approved  applicants  for  the  provision  of   necessary  equipment,           stock. &amp;c.
    5.  In planning to meet the demand from suitable applicants, the duplicationof costly separate buildings and equipment, with their consequential  inflated rents,should be avoided as far as possible.  In many places it should be possible, by theprovision of  land within reach of the tenants&apos; present dwellings,  to  avoid  muchspecial house building.                                                 . \                            (B.) Cottage Holdings.    1.  There is a class of small cultivator for whom  so  far little has been  done.They are those who want a cottage with an acre or so of land, and who might beprepared  to pay  an economic rent.  Under the existing law, a cottage holding is defined as a holding with a house and a quarter of an acre to three  acres of land.At present they can only be provided:       (i) For sale on the basis of an annual payment for 60 years representing the          full fair rent, or, at the option of the purchaser, of a terminable  annuity          for a period of less than 60 years of an  equivalent capital value.     (ii) For  bond  fide agricultural labourers or for persons employed in  a  rural          industry ancillary to the industry of agriculture or horticulture approved          by the Minister and carried on in or adjacent to a village.    (iii) By County Councils and not by County Borough Councils.These conditions clearly exclude a large number of  people who, if they could rent acottage  and a small area of land,  would provide a welcome addition to the  ruralcommunity.    2.  It is therefore recommended that powers now vested in County Councils toprovide cottage holdings for sale should be extended to County Borough Councils.These holdings should, moreover, be available  for letting at a full fair rent, as wellas for sale,  to any approved applicant who undertakes to live  in the cottage andcultivate the land.    3.  The liability on the State to contribute towards the cost up to 75 per cent.of any loss on approved schemes would remain as at present.APPENDIX  II.                      HOLDINGS FOR SMALL CULTIVATORS.     r                         Emergency Scheme.    1.   The question  of  the  provision of small holdings for unemployed miners(equally  applicable  to  any  unemployed  industrial  workers)  was  discussedexhaustively in a  memorandum prepared by the  Ministry of  Agriculture andFisheries for the Inter-Departmental Committee on Unemployment, D.U.  (29) 4.    2.   Since the preparation of that memorandum, further  consideration has beengiven to the types of holdings which might be provided, and to the  nature of thehouses  and buildings to be  erected, with  a view to the reduction of capitalexpenditure.  : ,    3.   In order to reduce  capital cost, it might be desirable to limit an experi-mental scheme to      (i) Holdings  not exceeding  5 acres for poultry-keeping with house and           buildings.                                        -.    .    , (ii) Holdings not exceeding 5 acres  for&apos; market gardening with house and           buildings.               (The above holdings would be provided wherever suitable land could           be  obtained,  and workers would move to the holdings.)    (iii) Holdings not exceeding 5  acres for  poultry-keeping with-buildings only.
     (iv) Holdings not exceeding  5 acres for market gardening with buildings           only.               (These would be provided in the vicinity of the workers&apos; homes, thus           avoiding the cost of erection of dwelling houses.)               All the above are intended to provide in  time  full-time occupation           and be self-supporting.      (v) Bare land holdings of, say, up to an acre (in effect, a large  allotment).               (These would be intended  merely as a &quot; part-time occupation &quot; and           would,not be  self-supporting,  being used  primarily  for  production  of           vegetables, &amp;c, for consumption by the tenant  and his family.)    4.  If a dwelling house is to be erected on the holding, it is suggested  that itshould be either a brick or concrete tiled cottage, or a timber and slated, or asbestoscement roofed bungalow,  containing a good-sized living  room,  scullery, and threebedrooms, larder,  fuel store, and earth closet.  The cost of such a dwelling house isestimated at  400, to which must be added any cost of road-making, fencing, watersupply, or exceptional drainage work.    5.  The average cost .and  annual loss  on holdings of the types suggested maybe estimated as follows :     (i) Poultry holding of 5 acres with dwelling house :                          Capital cost of land, &amp;c.  ...       ...       ...       ...     250           Capital cost of house      ...       ...       ...       ...     425           Capital cost of buildings (storage, &amp;c.)     ...       ...      60                 Total     ...       ...       ...       ...       ...     735           (If a gross rent of 105. per  week could be obtained,  the net rent,      after allowing for maintenance  and insurance, management and  con-      contingencies, may be put at  15, so that, if interest is reckoned at 5 per      cent, on the  capital outlay, there would be an annual loss of   21 15s.)(ii) Market Garden Holding of 5 acres  with dwelling house :            Capital cost  of land, &amp;c.  ...       ...       ...      ...    350      Capital cost  of house      ...       ...       ...      ...    425      Capital cost  of buildings ...       ...&quot;     - ...      ...    150             Total      ...    .   ...       ...       ...      ...    925           (If a gross rent of 13s. Qd. per week could be obtained, the net rent,      after allowing for maintenance and insurance, management and con-      contingencies, may be put at  20, so that, if interest is reckoned at 5 per      cent, on the  capital outlay, there  would be  an annual loss of  26.)(iii)  Poultry-holding of 5 acres, without house :                          Capital cost of land, &amp;c.  ...      ..-.             250      Capital cost of buildings (storage, &amp;c.)      ...       ...     60                        Total  ...       ...       ...       ...    310    (On the basis of a gross rent of 5s.  per week, the net rent, after allowing for maintenance and insurance, management and contingencies,may beput at  10, so that, if interest is reckoned at 5 per  cent, on thecapital outlay, there would be an annual loss of  5 10s.)(iv) Market Garden Holding of 5 acres, without house :                  Capital cost of land, &amp;c.  ...       ...      ...       ...    350      Capita] cost of buildings ...       ...      ...       ...    150Total  ...       ...       ...       ...    500    (On the basis of a gross rent of 7s. 6c/. per week, the net rent, after allowing for maintenance and insurance, management and contingencies,may be  put at  15  10s., so that, if interest is reckoned at  5 per cent, onthe capital outlay, there would be an annual loss of  9 10s.)
    (v) Bare land holding up to an acre :                                        Cost of land     ...       ...       ...       ...     -  ...    200               (Interest at 5  per cent, on cost would be  10, but if the land were           leased instead of purchased, subject to the owner being entitled  o resume           possession for building or industrial development, it  might be1  possible         -  to lease at a rent of  4 per acre, plus the additional  expense of  fencing,           paths, water, &amp;c.               The normal rent for a holding of this character near a town would           not be less than  5 per acre, but, even if the unemployed worker continued           to draw his unemployment benefit, it would probably be desirable that he           should pay only one-half of the rent for the first year.)    6.  It will be necessary to supply any unemployed worker taking a holding withthe capital to work it.  The capital required as regards the five  classes  of holdingssuggested would be as follows :                                                                               (i) Working  capital (including  birds,  and necessary         housing, runs, &amp;c.) ...       ...       ...       ...    500 (ii) Working capital        ...       ...       ...       ...    250(iii) Working capital        ...       ...       ...       ...    500(iv) Working capital        ...       ...       ...       ...    250 (v) Working capital (for seeds, manures and tools)      ...    5 to 20    7.  It will also be necessary to make provision for the maintenance of the workerin the early stages,  possibly by  the continuance of unemployment benefit on  a diminishing scale.    8.  Good work has already been done by the Societv of Friends and other bodies in South Wales and  similar distressed areas  in enabling unemployed workers tocultivate small areas of land.  Full use should be made of such local agencies, wheresuitable arrangements for adequate local supervision can be devised.APPENDIX  III.

A few enterprising agriculturists in this country have shown  that, givencapable business management, coupled with the  utilisation of modern knowledge and methods on a large enough scale to provide economical  marketing units, fruitfarming,  stock-raising  on up-to-date grass and alternative  cereal methods,  pigrearing, poultry-keeping, &amp;c,  can be  and are successful.  There is need  for furtherdemonstration of the possibilities of these large-scale operations applied to a unit of,say, 5,000 acres, of which some portion might be let as farms and small-holdings toselected tenants.    2.  The farmers&apos; tours that  have lately been  developing so satisfactorily showthat there are a great many, especially among the younger men, who are keen to learnand to adopt new methods if they can see them displayed on well-managed lines as-business propositions;  and there is undoubtedly a great opportunity for developingsuch foci of information and specialised demonstration in conjunction with provisionfor propaganda and facilities for inspection.   These large-scale and demonstrationfarms  would supplement the  existing college and county machinery  for technicaladvice for, farmers,  and would provide additional centres from which advice on methods could be given.    3.  It  would be difficult  for  a  Government  Department to run  such largebusiness undertakings, and I think that  we should contemplate that their manage-ment should be in the hands of a specially constituted Corporation.
Q    4.  I propose that the Ministry should be authorised to set up an agricultural land Utilisation Corporation on the lines of the following scheme :                 AGRICULTURAL LAND UTILISATION  CORPORATION.                               Proposed  Scheme.(A) General.    (a) The Agricultural Land Utilisation Corporation should be established as a legal entity, either by Royal Charter or under the Companies Acts.    (b) The Directors would .be appointed  by the Minister; and the Minister or  hisnominees would be the sole shareholders if there are shares.    (c) The Corporation  would be  subject to any directions on matters of generalpolicy which the Minister may see fit to give.    (d) The Corporation would be authorised to buy, sell, lease, and mortgage, land,to appoint officers, and to be generally in the position of an absolute owner.(B) Functions. To acquire and manage land     (a) Lor large-scale farming.    (b) For equipping (if necessary) and selling (subject to control of the Minister)or letting to selected persons, e.g.,  men who have qualifications from  AgriculturalColleges or Farm Institutes.    (c)  For such provision of small-holdings as  is incidental to the management oflarge  estates.    The Corporation should also have power to advance money to selected tenantsfor the provision of equipment and  for working capital.(C) Finance.    (a) The Corporation should receive a total initial advance of  1,000,000.  Thiswould enable  the  Corporation  to  deal with 20,000 acres,  assuming  that  cost of acquisition and farming capital would amount  to  50  per acre.    (b) Further development would be financed out of  possible profits  and by loanson mortgage.APPENDIX  IV.    ADVANCES TO TENANTS OF MINISTRY AND LAND UTILISATION CORPORATION.     1  A scheme for the provision of loans for equipment and farming capital isnecessary       (i) To enable the Ministry and the Land Utilisation Corporation  to improve           the type of settler, the possession of capital not always being the best test.     (ii) To enable the tenant to adopt improved methods of cultivation and extend           his operations.    (iii) To assist in the provision of additional minor equipment.    2.  The scheme suggested would provide for credit facilities to ,    (a) Tenants of the Ministry under any land settlement scheme, including any           scheme for the settlement of unemployed workers.,    (b) Unemployed workers taking up  allotment gardens.    (c) Tenants of the Land Utilisation Corporation.    3.  Following the precedent of Section 18 of  the  Land Settlement (Facilities)Act, 1929, both the Ministry and the Corporation should have power, subject to theprovisions of  any  regulations  made by the Treasury, to make advances  by way ofloan to any of their tenants of such sums as they may think necessary for the purchaseof livestock, fruit trees, seeds, fertilisers and implements required.for the purposeof the holding.       [21363]                                                         c
    4.  In any scheme for settling unemployed workers on small holdings,  it isobvious that the worker would require to be supplied with the whole of the necessaryinitial working capital.    5.  The  duty of providing allotment gardens  for  the unemployed should beundertaken  by the Local Authorities at present responsible for the provision ofallotment gardens in the ordinary way.  In distressed  districts, State assistance should be made available to make up any deficiency due to the  fact that the unem-ployed worker may be unable to pay an economic rent.  He would also require creditassistance to purchase his seeds, manures and tools, but the amount in any individual case would be quite small and the Local Authority might be given power  to  make advances  out of their own funds, any expense or loss to rank for assistance from theExchequer as part of  the general scheme for providing unemployed  workers withallotment gardens.APPENDIX  V.Outline of Proposals for Legislation for (a) Acquisition of Land  by  the Ministry,                   and (b) Amendment of Small Holdings Acts.(a) Acquisition of Land by the Ministry.     1.  POWER for the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to acquire land forthe purpose of large-scale farms, experimental farms, profit-sharing or co-operativefarms, and land settlement.     2.  For the purpose of such acquisition, the Minister to have  the same powers as may be exercised bv a County Council under the Small Holdings and AllotmentsActs, 1908 to 1926-     3.  Full powers  for the Minister  to hold, transfer, sell, lease, and generallymanage and equip land,  including poAver to  erect  houses and buildings,  and to execute any improvement on or in connection with the land, subject, in the case of sale, to consent of Treasury.     4.  PoAver for  the Minister to appoint agents for the better carrying out of any scheme, and poAver for the Minister to delegate any  of his poAvers, except  those of acquisition and sale, to such agents.  (Note. Such agents would  include the proposedLand  Utilisation Corporation, Avhose  poAvers  are set out in  Appendix  III,  and include poAvers of voluntary acquisition.)     5.  Power  for the  Minister  to make or guarantee  loans  to tenants of smallholdings, cottage holdings and  allotments provided  by  him for  the purchase of livestock, fruit trees, seeds, fertilisers, and   implements,  including  advances nto.unemployed workers who, possess no capital.     6.  PoAver for the Minister to make grants to Local Authorities in distresseddistricts toAvards the provision of allotment gardens for unemployed  Avorkers,  and credit assistance, to such  persons for the purchase of seeds, manuresand tools.(b) Amendment of  Small Holdings Acts.     7.  Amend&apos; Section 12 of  the Small Holdings  and Allotments Act, 1926, toenable County Councils to let, and County Borough Councils to let and  to sell cottageholdings  to any suitable applicant, the only statutory  test of suitability  being abond fide intention  of occupying&quot;the cottage as his home and cultivating the  holding.A cottage holding to be defined as a house and an area  of betAveen a quarter of an acreand an acre of land, thus avoiding  the  present overlapping definition of &quot;smallholding &quot; and &apos;&quot; cottage  holding.&quot;
                       THE SPECIAL POSITION OF CEREALS.                                 Wheat Quota.           *    1.  The  existing depression in agriculture  is most marked in arable  areas,largely owing to the severe competition  of foreign cereals, which is intensified inmany cases by export bounties.   Eor this  reason proposals for assisting  cerealgrowers must receive special consideration.    2.  It is impossible to ignore  the deep impression that is being made, and the&apos;way opinion  is being influenced by the records and the effect of these bounty-fedimports (and on the assumption that the taxation of food  imports is out of thequestion), it is important,  not  only to agriculture, but to  the maintenance of ourFree Trade policy that some way, which will not  conflict with the tax-free entry offood-stuffs and  our treaty obligations,  should  be  found  of dealing with  theirundoubtedly damaging effect upon  the home producer.    3.  Some commodities, such as milk and potatoes, owing to natural causes, havea fairly  secure  position in the home market which  could be improved  by  betterorganisation.  In the case of cereals, however, special measures are necessary toprovide an incentive for  improved  organisation, since  home-grown  cereals are particularly liable to be forced  off  the market by  the competition of  cheap imports.    4.  The rapid decrease in cereal acreage is upsetting the balance of the farming industry as a whole, and is disorganising the  market for other agricultural com-modities, owing to the excessive area which is now being devoted to their production..    5.  The  consumer should be allowed to reap the  full benefit of  cheap imports,but, at the same time, to avoid any further displacement of agricultural labour, thehome producer should be assured of a definite share of the home market.    6.  Wheat,  being a cash crop, is  the most important of the cereals, and  owingto this country&apos;s high degree of dependence on foreign supplies, there is no inherentdanger in adopting a policy which might lead to its more extensive production here.The economic reactions of  such  a  policy  on farm labour and on the  crop and stocksections of the industry are bound to be beneficial, while  the introduction of any measure  for  stimulating the production  of  British wheat  will have an immediate and wholesome effect, not only on  the marketing of that particular commodity, butthrough the whole range of agricultural production and marketing,    1.  The only immediately practicable method of assuring a guaranteed demand in the home market  for wheat is by means of a statutory quota for home-grown wheatof millable quality.  An outstanding advantage of the proposal is that cheap foreignsupplies  will create no inconvenience, but will  in fact be welcomed.  A number ofother countries have adopted variations of the quota idea,  and enquiries made into some of the existing schemes in Germany, Sweden and elsewhere show that they are working  smoothly, and to the advantage of the home producer.    8.  The advantages of  the particular quota plan here proposed are as follows :        (i) It secures a definite share of the home  market for British  wheat, and so           affords the home farmer some shelter from the effect of bounty-fed imports           while it leaves the consumer free to get the benefit of those imports, and           does this with the minimum of interference with existing trade practices.      (ii)  It avoids unnecessary transport of British wheat, and it prevents difficulties           due to local shortages.                    *     (iii) It enables the wheat to be ground at the most convenient centres, and should           not, on that account, be prejudicial to the interests of country millers.     (iv)  It is open  to no reasonable objection from flour importers and is, therefore,           not likely to involve  difficulties with Dominion millers.      [21363]     &apos;                                                    n
                                Outline  of Plan.     9.   Every sale  of British  wheat by  a  farmer must (for  quota purposes) be registered  at a  local office  of  Customs  and  Excise.   On  registration,  a QuotaCertificate showing  quantity, &amp;c, will be issued to the buyer by the Customs  and excise Officer.  The Certificate will be transferable.  If a consignment is rejectedon the grounds of quality, the Quota  Certificate will be  cancelled.     10.  British millers, as  a  whole, will  be required  to  purchase a prescribedquantity of British wheat (the Quota)  and to produce Quota Certificates as evidencethat they have done  so.  There will, however, be no obligation upon each individualmill to grind its quota quantity,  but each mill will be required  to  produce  thenecessary Quota  Certificates  proportionate to the total  quantity  of wheat of allkinds  milled in that  mill.   The quantity  represented by each  miller&apos;s QuotaCertificates will be checked periodically by the appropriate Government Departmentagainst the total quantity of wheat milled by the miller and the Certificates taken up.Millers who hold Quota Certificates in excess of quota requirements will be  at liberty to transfer, their  excess of certificates to other persons who need them.     11.  In order that a flour importer may clear his flour  from Customs control,he must obtain, by purchase of National Mark flour or British wheat or otherwise,Quota Certificates representing a quantity of British wheat equivalent to the amountof the Quota reckoned on the flour that lie desires to import,  and surrender them tothe Customs.     12.  An important feature of the  scheme would be that periodical variations inthe amount of the Quota would be as far as possible automatic and would be removed from political influence.     13.  The scheme will include adequate safeguards  for the protection of  theconsumer.     14.  The scheme postulates a minimum price of 45s. per quarter  for millable wheat of fair average quality,  and the Quota would  disappear when  the average price of home-grown wheat reaches 55s. per quarter.     15.  As an  illustration  of  the effect of the system on flour prices, it may be,stated that at present prices of home-grown wheat a 15 per cent, quota, assuming itsecured 50s. a quarter for the home producer, would by itself increase the cost of asack of flour by Is. 6d.  A sack of flour produces 96 loaves.  Apart,  therefore, fromany  economies whatever, the  increase  in  the price of  the 4  lb. loaf would only be three-quarters of a farthing.     16.  It is essential in order to secure the full advantages of the scheme that itsinauguration should be conditional on the creation of a Producers&apos; Wheat Marketing-Board under  the Agricultural Marketing Bill.   The scheme can  only come intooperation at the commencement of a cereal year, i.e., in September,  and, if we pa?sthe necessary legislation early in the new Session, it might be possible to secure theformation of such a Marketing Board  in  time to enable the scheme to operate from september 1931.
                        AGRICULTURAL  MARKETING BILL.    1.  A study of marketing conditions and development indicates that marketingorganisations :      (a) Must be based upon a single commodity or group of related commodities, and          be on such a comprehensive scale that they will facilitate self-supporting,          businesslike arrangements for grading,  packing, storage, transport and          sale.    (b) Should be  based upon the producers  themselves, and be provided  with          adequate powers, in order  to be responsive to  the industry&apos;s conditions          and to provide a means  for fostering improved  methods. .    2.  Although  an innovation in this  country, there are a number of precedentsin various British Dominions for the  creation of producers&apos; commodity marketingorganisations with power of control over minorities.    3.  The accompanying draft Bill seeks to  carry  out  these principles.  It hasbeen much improved and simplified in various ways as a result of recent discussions between the Minister of Agriculture,  the Secretary of State for  Scotland and the attorney-General.   The Bill will include  adequate safeguards for the small producer and special provisions for  the protection of the consumer.    4.  The principal changes, as compared with the draft previously before theCabinet, are as follows :        (i) Certain clauses designed to  secure  democratic control by producers and           providing for  the  exemption of  certain producers have, for political           reasons, been brought up from the Schedules and given early prominence           in  Clause 2.      (ii) The  old  Clause 2, which was  distinguished by  a large number of sub-           clauses,  has been simplified  by the relegation of certain less important           matter to the Schedules and by the segregation of the financial provisions           into a separate Clause  5.     (iii) The  Bill now provides that  all schemes must be laid before Parliament           before they become operative.      (iv)  The Bill is now limited to 6 commodities, i.e-, milk,  potatoes, hops, wool,           cereals and cheese, with power to add to them, subject to the approval of           Parliament.      (v) Clause 7 (which provides for the investigation of complaints against any           provision of a scheme or against anything done or omitted to be done by           a  Board) has  been broadened so as to  admit complaints from  any           substantial  number of  persons affected by a scheme.   This will enable           complaints to be made by producer-minorities or by trading interests.     (vi) A new  clause will  make  special  provision for the  investigation  of           complaints in the interests of consumers.&apos;    (vii) The  difficulties which have  arisen  between  the  Scottish Office  and the           Ministry of  Agriculture have now been resolved by the provision of a           special  application clause for  Scotland.   This will  provide  that, in           certain circumstances, an existing agricultural co-operative society may           be constituted a Board  for the purposes of a scheme, and that a member           of an agricultural society,  which is also a board, can create in favour of           the board a charge over the produce of  his farm which he  is under           contract or under order to sell to or through the board.
