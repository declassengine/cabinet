In December 1928 the Indian National Congress beingdivided on the issue of  &quot;Independence&apos; against &quot;dominion status&quot; accepted on the  advice of Mr. Gandhi a motion that, ifDominion Status were not achieved before the end of the year1929 the official policy of the Congress should become a claimto  Independence.  On November 1st 1929 &quot;the Viceroy made his statement that the goal  of British policy was Dominion status and that a Conference would be called in London after the issueof the Simon Report to secure agreement on the issues involved.At first this statement was well received;  but its acceptance by the Congress was made conditional upon a declaration thatthe Conference was to discuss a Dominion Status Constitution,that political prisoners should be released, and repressivelegislation relaxed.   These conditions not being agreed to,Congress at Lahore in December declared for Independence and announced a campaign of Civil Disobedience.  In the meantime,the non-Congress parties continued actively their preparations for participating in the Conference.  No important signs ofCivil Disobedience appeared until the inauguration byMr. Gandhi in April of breaches of the Salt laws.  In the hopethat this demonstration would excite but little attentioneverything was done to refrain from unnecessarily severemeasures against it.  The order,  however,  was given that where flagrant breaches of the lav/ occurred the obvious                                              leaders(THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT),      SECRET.                                       Copy No Ly      C.P.5^ (30)                       CABINET.           The Congress Campaign and The Conference.            Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.
78leaders should be arrested and tried and the pursuit of this-course resulted in  some of the leading Congressmen beingconvicted before Mr. Gandhi had actually arrived at the end ofhis march.   It then began to become increasingly clear thatthe salt campaign was merely a token protest.  During its progress, public order, on the whole, was preserved but theauthority of Government was more and more weakened and action against Mr. Gandhi became necessary.  He might of course have been charged and convicted but it was considered moreconsiderate to Hindu opinion to intern him and this was accordingly done on the 4th May.  To-day, although a largenumber of Congress leaders have been arrested, the spread ofthe movement is unchecked. From salt it has proceeded toboycott, and the picketing of liquor shops, and the intention is that it shall be extended to the non-payment of land tax and rent - an extension which&apos; would be the most dangerous of allas it would take the movement from the urban to the rural districts.          It is quite true to say that the actual disordershave been, with exceptions, confined to the urban districts;but it has never been said, and it would be untrue to say,that the emotional  state conditioning disorders does not exist far beyond the centres of actual outbreak.  In Gujerat (arur--l area) the machinery of Government has been largelyundermined, and in other rural districts also, whetherlocal grievances are the excuse or whatever other reason theremay be, the same intense emotional strain is traceable.Moreover, in the cities where disorders have occurred, a spirit of sympathy has spread extensively, if not universally,                                                    among
 793- among Indians of all  classes  and creeds.   The  Central Committee of Congress have now even set afoot  an organised campaign to seduce the military and the police;   and  in  the North-West Frontier Province  have not shrunk from making strong endeavours to  stir up  the fierce tribes in unadministered territory. Repressive measures and their^effect .          &quot;&quot;&quot;Tins - organ!seoTaTtempt to -bring  Government to  an end  has  been necessarily met,  not only by  the  use of the very extensive powers ordinarily possessed by authority, e.g.  Seditious Meetings Act,  Criminal  Law  Amendment Act, etc.,  but by legislation by Ordinance  of a most  rigorous kind,  e.g. against picketing,  against instigation to non- payment  of  taxes,  etc.  Furthermore  the Press Act  of 1910 has been  re-imposed.   It  was  always  realised that  autocratic powers of this  kind would excite great  resentment extending far beyond the circles  of those against whom the powers were exercised.   Moreover,  in physical encounters it  is quite impossible to guarantee  the conduct of every member of the Government  forces.           It would  perhaps  be going too far to say that the resentment  at  these measures has  in itself created adherents of civil  disobedience;  but it  is true  to  say  that resentment against  such measures,  combined with  stories, mostly untrue, of brutalities  committed, has  ripened  a  seed already in the ground. In any case,  the necessary  use of the  forces described has been accompanied by a very wide  extension of sympathy with the Congress movement, of acknowledgment of the natural leadership  of Mr. Gandhi  and of a corresponding atrophy of the efforts  at and promises of co-operation which characterised the period before Christmas.  Interesting indications of the varied and extensive  character of this feeling can be given.Women are taking a leading part, not only  in public  demonstrations                                                        but
but in active private/rork amongst their friends.      In Bombaythe Parsis have been interesting themselves.  Business menand Chambers of Commerce have been manifesting sympathy and,although their material interests are suffering, they have always tended to blame the Government and not the Congressfor their troubles. Sports Associations have been declining toplay inter-racial matches. The attitude of the Liberals was atfirst one of courageous co-operation, but meetings which wereattempted in Bombay were broken up;  public championship of theConference then ceased, private efforts gradually waned, and itwould not be too much to say that the Liberals, distinguishedin personnel, but lacking in public following, are now lookingon with a half-sympathy to the results of the Congress campaign.I have received numerous expressions of personal opinion onthese matters, from which I will select those of Mrs. Reddy,the ex-Deputy President of the Madras Legislative Council, andMr. K.T. Paul, one of the leading Indian Christians, whose attitude is perhaps characteristic in that, though they would notexpress sympathy with civil disobedience, nor take part in it,they cannot help conceding to Mr. Gandhi and the Congress a natural leadership as of right&apos; of a movement with the generaldemands of which they are in sympathy.  Their attitude, in fact,may be compared to that of the constitutional suffragiststowards the militant suffragettes.  It may also be mentioned that the expressed opinions of some of the leading Princeshave been increasingly Liberal,  and both the Maharaja of Bikanerand the Jam Sahib of Nawanagar (Ranjitsinhji) to give twoexamples,  speak freely about the need for Dominion Status.^iGdu-Maliomnedan. Dissension.          The Viceroy informs me that the tension between Aie Mahommedan and Hindu communities is still acute, and .Qspite the Palestine and Peshawar occurrences, the leaders of the !ahommedan community have remained steadfastly opposed to  the lvil  disobedience movement and their followershave not anticipated in it.   Volume II of tho Simon Report will no doubt confirm them in this view.  But it is nevertheless
 true  to  say that,  in the Youth Societies, which are amongst the most active  of the  insurrectionary forces, communal disturbances  do  not count, as indeed they do not  in the much less  important trade union movement or movements  for the betterment of the  condition of women.  It must not be inferred that Mahommedan opinion  is not as  insistent on the terms  of its  demand as  Hindu opinion.  It merely means that, in the absence of  adventitious causes of union, such as existed in the &quot;Khilafat  question ten years agok the Mahommedans are not willing  to join  with the Hindus in a law-breaking campaign;  in Bonibav City however the hold of Congress on the local Moslems was demonstrated early  this month by a procession numbering several  thousands  of which the nucleus consisted of local &quot;Congress Mo s1emsn.          In  short,  the truth about the situation appears to me to be that, among  all classes of  Indians, there is a great and growing  sense of national and racial consciousness which finds expression in opposition to foreign rule, that the Party which has  shown itself willing to take an active leader- ship, namely  the Congress, is securing an acknowledgment of its right to that position  from other and conflicting parties, and further, that, though the movement is in the main unarmed, the number of active participants,  as in the demonstrations in Bombay,  is presenting great practical difficulties.     The overt movement lias  developed at a. speed and with a momentumwhich has taken  by  surprise the most qualified observers and this development has  taken place since the Statutory Commission completed its labours in India,   so that,  although I have tried to hint at the facts  in statements in Parliament,  the situation is not generally appreciated in this country.          In short, the fundamental difficulty is  that,  whileGreat Britain regards the Commission&apos;s Report as the handbook                                                     for
for the solution of  the problem,  a great  volume  of indian opinion, Liberal and the like,  which was  looking towards  theConference, is now rather looking with hope  towards theC o ngress campa ign.The Conference.          It is in the li; ht of the events of which I have drawn a by no means over-coloured picture above  that a decision has to be taken regarding the nest step.       It was alwaysrecognised that the Conference  would form an important part of proceedings preliminary to the  framing of a  new  indian constitution. Touching this the making of the Declaration ofthe 1st November last has proved fortunate.   Both the aim ofBritish policy and the means of pursuing it  were there describedthough in vague terms, and it is therefore possible now,without appearing to yield in the least to the Congress campaign,to declare more fully the purposes of the Conference.A draft of words provisionally agreed with the Viceroy isattached.  It will be observed that the scope of the Conference,as there described, is very wide, the powers of the indian representatives very extensive, and the undertakings given-very generous.  In point of fact, I have little  doubt that aConference on these lines really meets, and perhaps more  thanmeets, the natural demand of the Liberals and the real desires ofthe Congress.  It might be supposed therefore that the definition of the Conference in these terms would Immediately attract the mass of thinking; Indian opinion.   I think this would be  so,but for the fact that the leadership has been secured, for reasons already mentioned, by the Congress.   Mr. Sastri,  with whom I discussed in general terms the scope  we proposedto accord to the Conference, saw, I believe, no particular difficulty inthe terms used;  he wont on however to indicate  that unless                                       &quot;  \               the
the Congress attended the Conference, it would be difficultor even impossible for Liberals to do so.  It is possible and even probable therefore that the Conference may not secure that measure of support in caste-Hindu circleswhich would enable the new Constitution to be put intooperation with a&apos;wide measure of public goodwill.21st June 1930.
PROPOSED STATEMENT TO BE MADE BY THE PRIME MINISTER OR             SECRETARY OF STATE EOR IELIA .               The Statutory Commission has recently submittedits Report, and I should like to take this opportunity of paying ray tribute to Sir John Simon and all his colleagues forthe single-minded devotion which they have brought to thedischarge of the task entrusted to them   by Parliament threeyears ago.  It has naturally not been possible as yet for HisMajestyrs Government to study the Report as a whcfe , and I expressno opinion, at this stage, about the several conclusionsincorporated in it-.  But anyone reading the two volumescontaining their review and recommendations can judge for himselfhow great was the labour that was involved in the Commission^enquiries, with what unremitting energy they have pursued it,and the magnitude of the contribution they have made towards theunravelling of the great problem that now confronts us.  Onbehalf of His Majesty^ Government, a.s on behalf of all parties in Parliament, I should like to tender to the Chairman and members of the Commission our sincere and grateful  thanks.               2.  The next stage in the treatment of these matterswill be the Conference which, it will be remembered, His Majesty^Government at Sir John Simon1s suggestion have decided to convene.  The date of its assembly has already been made public,and it is now possible to define its functions more precisely.Since the Conference is being summoned for the express purposeof bringing Indian opinion to bear in an authoritative manner,His Majesty1s Government have reached the conclusion that itwould not be right to limit its scope by any terms of reference                                                     more
more restricted than were  implied  in the viceroy s statementof  1st November last, which defined tho purpose as that of conference and discussion  in  regard both to British-indian and All-Indian problems.   His Majesty&quot; s Government arc ,therefore ,of  opinion that tho Conference should enjoy the full libertythat these words connote.              3.  It was also stated by the Viceroy on behalfof  His Majesty1s Government that in their judgment the naturalissue of India&apos;s constitutional progress, as contemplated inthe Declaration of 1917, was the attainment of Dominion Status,and it must therefore be tho desire of His Majesty&quot; s Governmentto  lend every assistance in  their power to India in such development.               The object  of the Conference between his majesty&apos;s Government and representatives from India will accordingly be to secure the greatest agreement for proposalsconsistent with this purpose.              It will be for the Conference to examine any proposals placed before it by any of those participating in  its work for the realisation of His Majesty&quot;s Government&apos;sdeclared policy, and, in particular, to explore means ofmaking the most appropriate provision, under the new constitution for such vital matters as  foreign policy, defence, internal security and  the future position of minorities, on the wisetreatment of which the well-being of India so evidentlydepends and for the ultimate inclusion of Indian States, when&apos;they so desire, in the future Commonwealth of India.              4.  It will bo reoognised with this generaldefinition of purpose, which His Majesty&apos;s Government trust                                                      will
                                                               3.will guide the deliberations of the Conference,  that  it  isimpossible for thorn to prejudge the issue of the discussions  thatwill shortly take place.  Those discussions will represent an earnest attempt, in the spirit to  which T have sought to  giveexpression, to reach agreement on these difficult matters among those who will speak respectively for Great Britain and  forIndia, and His Majesty&apos;s Government greatly hope that those inIndia, who have hitherto felt unwilling to take  part  in   thisconstructive work, will be prepared to reconsider theirdc-cision.              5.  It is the belief of His Majesty1 s Governmentthat, hy way of conference, it may not he impossible  toreach solution that both countries and all parties and interestsin them can honourably accept and - no effort will be spared  onthe part of the Government to further this end,  and in particular to assist in harmonising conflicting interests in matters in dispute among the various communities in India.   Further I  maystate that it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s  Government  thatany such agreement at which the Conference is able to arriveis ill form the basis of proposals which His Majesty&apos;s  Governmentwill later submit to Parliament.
