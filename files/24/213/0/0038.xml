As regards the  nationality of married          women,  the  Committee generally reaffirmed  the  views  expressed at  the  previous          meeting (see LEU.

APPENDIX.    His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have, in these circumstances,recently given further careful consideration to the whole question of British interestsin the Group.  In the course of their examination, the following possible courses ofaction emerge :      1.  The existing arrangements should be continued and an effort should be made          to improve the position of British interests.  It is clear that this would          involve  considerably  increased  expenditure  from United  Kingdom          Exchequer, and His Majesty&apos;s  Government in  the United Kingdom do          not  feel disposed to incur the increased expenditure  which  would be          required in  view of the  smallness of  the United  Kingdom interests          concerned.    2.  A fresh endeavour could be made to get France to agree to a partition of the          group.   Previous proposals for a partition ivhich were  made  to the          French Government in 1926 were rejected by them, and  as, since  that          date, French interests have steadily  increased at the expense of British,          it is hardly likely that the French Government would agree to acquire by          partition what they may hope to obtain, in substance at least, by merely          waiting.    3.  It  may  be that, in  view  of  the fact that their  interest  in  the group  is          substantially greater than that of the United Kingdom, His Majesty&apos;s          Government in the Commonwealth of Australia or His Majesty&apos;s Govern-          ment in New Zealand may be disposed to take over the administration of          the British share of the Condominium.    It is felt that the Imperial Conference affords a convenient opportunity for a discussion of the questions at issue by the representatives of those of His Majesty&apos;governments which are concerned.o
