Copy  No.     3?O.P. 221  (30).                                 CABINET.WEST INDIES:  POLITICAL  ASPECT  OF THE SUGAR QUESTION.        MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.   I  CIRCULATE herewith  a copy of a  despatch  in which the Governor ofBarbados describes the recent visit of the United  States Squadron to ,the Island.I desire particularly to call the attention of my colleagues to the Governors remarksin paragraphs T to 9 of the despatch, which illustrate the  political aspect of thedifficulties  due to the sugar position.                                                                         P.   June 30, 1930.(Secret.)                                        Government House,My Lord,                                           Barbados, April 15, 1930.    IN my despatch No. 81 of the 14th April, 1930, I reported the visit to Barbadosof the United States Battleships &quot;New Mexico&quot; and &quot;Mississippi,&quot; the aircraft carrier  &quot;Saratoga,&quot;  with three destroyers and two  Aircraft  Tenders.  It hasoccurred to me that Your Lordship might like to have something  in the nature of amore general appreciation of this Squadron, its efficiency and personnel, and I attachfor your information  copies  of memoranda prepared by the Inspector-General ofPolice, Lieutenant-Colonel Heidenstam, the Staff Officer, Captain C. G. Gaden, and my Aide-de-Camp, Lieutenant C. W. Johns, R.N.  I have asked these  Officers togive their  impressions without reserve and to  omit nothing which struck them asworthy of notice or likely to be judged as of interest to the Lords Commissioners ofthe Admiralty.    2.  My opinion of the United States Navy had previously been formed on theexperiences gained from occasional visits of ships of that Navy to  Malta while I wasserving there, and I confess that I looked forward to the presence for ten days inBarbados waters of so large a  squadron as that of Rear-Admiral Schofield  withfeelings  in which perturbation was more prominent than pleasure.   One would notselect American seamen as the type of person most likely to acquiesce with patiencein the control of an African Police Force, and the prospect seemed remote of findingsufficient occupation and amusement daily for between two and three thousand sailorsto distract their attention  from the fact that they had but a few days in which tomake up for a lengthy period of dry discipline.  Moreover, satisfaction of the claims of hospitality more  insistent, naturally, in the case of strangers  than  in that offriends promised a legacy of  empty cellars.    3.  Anything more different from anticipation than our experience it would bedifficult to imagine.  The men who thronged Bridgetown and its  vicinity every daywere singularly polite and well-behaved, and there were no unpleasant incidents.Our Police rose to the occasion and were more than usually smart and orderly,particularly in traffic management.  They were, of course, relieved of anxiety by theadmirable  system  of the Fleet Picquets, but they seemed to have become inspiredthrough  the  example  of Lieutenant-Colonel Heidenstam and his  Officers with  aspecial sense of dignity and tact.    4.  Rear-Admiral Schofield, a small,  studious-looking Officer  with  spectacles,has recently been in the Surgeohs hands and is not yet physically fit.  He gave that      [21313]
 as his reason for refusing to stay at Government House while he was here, but I think his real reason was that,  as he had refused to allow  his sailors to remain on shore at night, he wished to avoid difference in privileges between Officers and men. \ He was most pleasant and outspoken, while careful to eschew politics.  He made anj excellent little speech in reply to the toast of his health, proposed by me, at the dinnerI given by the  United States Consul his text being, for the most part, the Naval I Conference which, in simplicity and effect, was worthy of Abraham Lincoln.   Hej seems to be regarded with admiration and affection by his officers and men.     5.  Rear-Admiral  Butler, taller and louder, with a distant resemblance to our I own Deputy  Chief of Naval  Staff,  was  equally  agreeable and  tactful.   Quite! intelligent and pleasantly keen, he was, perhaps, less erudite than his colleague,  il liked the Staff and other Officers whom I met.     6.   The leading impressions which the squadron  as a whole left on my  mind were that both Officers and men were studying keenly to make their  Navy  as good as or better than any other.  The discipline may not have been so marked as it is in our  Navy, but it  was there  in  all essentials, and one could not fail  to  recognise evidence of quiet determination to attain efficiency.     7.   The Press of  British  Guiana recently  quoted  speeches of  local  citizens setting forth the advantages that might follow administration of that  Colony by  the United  States.   These have  been reproduced  with comments here  and probably elsewhere, and it  is not unlikely that they contributed to the discretion observed by our visitors in references to British or  American politics.     8.  The article in question, coupled with the tendency common  in  a  certain class of persons to search in every action for ulterior motives, may have contributed towards the disfavour with which the news of the projected visit was received.   To illustrate the extent of that disfavour, I may mention that I felt obliged to abandon my intention of asking the House of Assembly to vote money for the entertainment of the sailors, an object which  usually receives cordial support, as the Members of the Executive Committee assured me that there  would be strong opposition to any such proposal, and that few of the opposers would agree to record  a silent  vote, contingency which it seemed injudicious to  risk in view of the publicity involved.     9.   I must give the Barbados Press full credit for decency  and restraint, but if I  may judge from reports of individual expressions of opinion which have  come to my notice, remarks and suggestions might have been made and published on which any  ordinary Editor might have been tempted to comment.     The suggestions of which I have heard some of them quite sinister are based for the most part on the known attitude of the United States with regard to the defence of the Panama Canal,  and amount to this:      That the United States consider American control of the Caribbean and indeed,  of all territory within striking distance of Panama-to  be essential to the security of the Canal; that the consent of the United States to any reduction of then Naval Armament was contingent on the acquisition of such control; that the agree ment between Great Britain and the United  States as regards reduction  of Naval Armament implies the acquiescence of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this condition and  that to secure this acquiescence the United  States might be prepared to forgo payment of the debt owed them by Great Britain.     These hypotheses are used to supply a motive for the visit of the Prime Minister to President Hoover, and the visit to the West Indies of a friendly American Fleet takes its logical place in the theorists&apos;  conception of  policy, paid as it has been at a time when so large a measure of publicity has been given to the difficulties withwhich these Islands are faced,  and to  the fact that  the  Imperial Government hasnot found itself in a position  fully to meet  the proposals for assistance which havbeen placed before it.    10.   There  is no point in my referring to these suggestions and suspicions-some of which owe their origin  to articles in English newspapers except  in so faras they  indicate  the  existence  in Barbados of apprehension at the  very idea  of separation from England and fear of possible absorption by the United States.have no doubt that the sentiment of attachment to the Mother Country is  no les
strong in the other old-established English Colonies in the Caribbean than it is inBarbados, but amongst thinking men in all of them there seems to be often presentthe  dread that  this sentiment will not by itself, nor  unless it receives practicalsupport, be strong enough to maintain what all desire, viz., the predominance ofGreat Britain  in West Indian trade.  Trade  between the West Indies and  theUnited States  is  now restricted not merely by the attraction  of the preferentialsystem  adopted  by Great  Britain and the Dominion  of Canada, but  by  theprohibitive American  Tariff on Imports.  The geographical position of the  west indies makes trade with America more easy for them than trade  with either  Canadaor England. If the United  States really aspire to acquisition  of the West Indiesit may occur to their statesmen that a step towards this might be the establishmentof Commercial Hegemony, and  that this might be more readily secured  by  makingtrade easy instead of, as now, difficult.  Loyal citizens in this part of His Majesty&apos;sEmpire may, perhaps, be pardoned if they feel doubt as  regards the maintenance,in that event, of  British Commerce possibly of British Dominion if they mustrely solely on their own sentiment.                                    I have, &amp;c.                                         W. C. F. ROBERTSON, Governor.The Right Hon. Lord Passfield, P.C.,     &amp;c,      &amp;c,      &amp;c.
