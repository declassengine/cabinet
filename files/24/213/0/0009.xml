IRAQ Oil, CQjl-committee                         XNTSRI1,: REPORT.     I.         In accordance with Cabinet 28(30) Conclusion (&quot;b)     the Iraq Oil Committee have re-examined the position and have     again conferred with Sir John Cadman thereon.     2.         The Cabinet  will remember  that in his Llemorandum     (C.?.164(50)) the Secretary of State for the Colonies drew   ,     attention to the fact  that the Iraq Government were most strongly     opposed to the Syrian  alignment for  the pipeline and were not     prepared to co-operate in a comprehensive settlement with France     on any such basis.   On the 16th June,  1930, a telegram was     received by the  Secretary of State for the Colonies, from the     High Commissioner for  Iraq, explaining in detail the reasons     underlying the  Iraq Government1s preference for the southern     (Haifa-Baghdad)  route.    A copy of this telegram is attached     (see Appendix I).     3,         The last  paragraph of the  Telegram called for an     immediate reply and the Committee approved a proposal of Lord     Passfield. that  the  reply should be to the effect:-           (l)  that  His Majesty&apos;s Government see no objection     to  the proposed communication to the Company;   but           (2)  that  they would prefer not to take the initiative     in bringing the  Iraq Government&apos;&apos;s views to the notice of the     French Government.               This  reply has now been sent to Sir F. Humphrys (see     Appendix II).                                 -1-
4.        7/ith regard to (2) above it should be explainedthat it will he difficult enough, in any case,  to persuade the French that the attitude of the Iraq Government has  beenadopted spontaneously and not under pressure from ourselves;but, if we were to act as a channel of communication in  themanner proposed, wo could hardly expect the French to believethat we had in fact stood aside.   Further, a communication  tothe French Government seems quite unnecessary,,    Once the iraq petroleum Company have been informed of the Iraq Government&apos;attitude, the information is certain to find its way, throughthe French elements in the Company, to the Government at Paris,5,        The Committee do not propose to take  any further action until it is seen how the situation develops as a  resultof the Iraq government s communication to the Iraq -petroleum company.    Arrangements have been made to ensure that any important developments will, be at once considered by theCommittee, and a further Report will then, if necessary,  besubmitted to the Cabinet,                   Signed on behalf of the Committee,                         ARTHUR HENDERSON                           (Chairman)2, V/hitehall Gardens,  S.V.1.     20th June, 1930.
APPENDIX I. C R E  T  ..0.(50) 10.                      CABINET.                    IRAQ OIL COMMITTEE. PARAPHRASE  TELEGRAM from the High. Owmtlas loner for  Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.  (Dated  16th June    Received Colonial  Office 6o32.p.m.  16th June,. 1930)IMPORTANT.  No. 276.        Addressed to Colonial Office repeated to Jerusalem by bag18 S.        Reference my telegram No. 216 of the loth May,   The fol-1owing are the principal reasons which the Iraq Ccvernmcnt havegiven to me for insisting that their own interests demand that thepipe-line and railway should be laid via the southern route toHaifa.  (l)   The alignment which affords Iraq the longest haul of railIand length of pipe-line in her own territory is obviously preferable to any other both on political and economic grounds.  (2)   Iraq is closely bound to Trans Jordan by natural ties ofIfriendship and mutual interest and desires that the line should pass through the territory of her friend.  (3)   Iraq Trans Jordan and Palestine are all closely connectedwith one great power.   Syria is connected with another.   It ismuch more satisfactory that the outlet to the Mediterranean,, shouldbe dependent upon one friendly power rather than on two.   If forinstance, Great Britain declares war Iraq automatically becomesinvolved,   Iraq wishes however to avoid being penalised in the matteof its railway communications and oil supplies should Prance go towar or Syria become involved in disturbances.
42     (4)    Although possibly, a su.it.abLe port for cil Tripoliis unsuitable for general shipping and it would be unsoundeconomically to open a new main trade route to the Mediterahneanleading to a port from which goods could not be shippedThesuggestion that Iraq goods and Persian goods in transit toIraq should be railed between Tripoli and Haifa (a &quot;haul&quot; ofabout 125 miles in foreip;n territory) involves the payment oftoll to both Syria and Palestine and gives to Syria a strangle-hold on Iraq traffic     (5)    The Iraq Government desire. ths.t if ocean transportvia Basra Is to be ousted by a trans-decert railway theterminus should be. at Baghdad so that the whole country shalllook to the capital as the principal tra.de centre.   For this thesouthern alignment is preferable.     (6)    The Government of Iraq are anxious to develop tradowith Egypt and the best cormiviiulcatior with that country would beprovided by the southern alignment.     (7)    The distances for pilgrims to Jerusalem and Mecca \*rouldbe reduced and Syrian restriction would be eliminated by thesouthern alignment.     (8)    Trans-desert traffic by air and car is already concentratedat Rutbah where centralised protection and control have been es-tablished by the Iraq Government.   Police protection for a pipe-tine and railway also passing through Rutbah would require much ess 1&apos;e-organisatlon of control, and consequent extra expenditure n the- part of Iraq Government.     (9)    The southern alignment would be more valuable to the raq Government for strategic reasons.     (10)   Finally public opinion in Iraq is opposed to the construc- ion of a railway through Syria to Tripoli and the Iraq Parliament ould be unwilling to accept any agreement concluded by the Government hich provided for such a project.
43      I have, -scrupvil^jusJ^-r^lJcdJn^-^frcm giving -any advice         ?      &apos;   ?to the Iraq Government upon this question and  I haveconfined myself throughout to ascertaining thoir real views and putting them into plain language.   The  Iraq government now propose to  address the Iraq Petroleum Company  on tholines of this telegram and to definitely announce  that unlessthe Haifa line  is decided upon thtiy will not proceed with negotiations.   Before doing so however, they  have requested that I should ascertain whether&apos; H.M. Government see any objection and,  if not, whether H.M. Government would bring these considerations to the notice of the French government if asked officially by the Iraq Government to  do so.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.      18th June, 1930.
