DY? STUFFS (IMPORT REGULATION) ACT, 1920.Memorandum by the President of the        Board of Trade.     (1)  The Dyestuffs (Import Regulation) Act,1920, prohibits the importation into the United Kingdomof&quot;all 3ynthetic organic dyestuffs, colours andcolouring matters, and all organic intermediateproducts usod in the manufacture of any such dye-stuffs, colours or colouring matters0 except under licence granted by the Eoard of Trade.  The Act isdue to expire on the 15th January of next year and itwill be necessary to announce our intentions well before that date c     (2) The Act provided that for the purpose of advising the Board as to the granting of licences thereshould be constituted a Committee consisting of 5representatives of the colour using industries, 3representatives of the colour making industries, and3 independent persons, of whom one should be Chairman.The present Chairman, who has held the office for some7 years, is Sir Thomas Robinson, M,P.     (3) I have nor- received a very comprehensive reporton the progress and present position of the industry fromthe Dyestuffs Industry Development Committee, constituted,in accordance with Section 2 (6) of the Act, for the purposeof advising the Board of Trade v&quot;ith respect to the efficiencyIMS DOCU-v^NT IS TrF!

The Committee consists of 8 representatives  (oneof whom, Mr.  W.J.U.  Woolcock,  Is Chairman)  of the dye-makers and makers of heavy chemicals,  the latter feeingthe suppliers of intermediates to the  dye-makingindustry;  of 3 representatives of the usersjof 2 scientists nominated by the Department  of scientific and Industrial Research, and. 1 representa-tive oach of tho War Office and the Board of Trade.The report is unanimous and the following paragraphsset out the main conclusions and comments of theCommittoe.     (4) The Imports of synthetic dyestuffs  inthe United Kingdom in 1913 wore 32.6 million lbs.and tha total British production was 9.1 million lbs. In 1928 the foreign imports wore3.9 million lbs. and the British production 51million lbs.  (The Committee had not before  them the figures for 1929 but whilst there  was some increase in the importation in that year theBritish production increased by a further5,000,000 lbs.).  And with regard to this domestic production tha Committee point out that &quot;Whereasbefore the war such dyes tuffs as were  manufactured in this country were largely produced  from foreign intermediates, the quantity of intermediateswhich it was necessary to import in 1928 wasrelatively unimportant, tha dyestuff manufacturerseither making their own intermediates  or baingable to obtain thair supplies from othermanufacturers in this country&quot;.  The dyestuffsproduced in the United Kingdom now  represent about
93 per cent, of the quantity consumed In thiscountry and about 81 per cent, of the sale valueof the dyestuffs so consumed;  the divergoncobetween the quantity and value proportions boingdue to the Ja ct that there are certain varietiosof colours which are not at present produced inthi3 country and that theso aro generally of ahigher average value than ranges produced hero.     (5) The Committee say that &quot;the remarkableprogress In the aggregate production of Britishmakers Is undoubtedly an achievoment&quot; and alsothat:          &quot;there has boon a definite and steady      improvement  In the range of dyestuffs manu-      factured in  this country together with a      marked advance in quality and an aopreciablo      improvoiiient  in the regularity of deliveries&quot; *     As regards the first of  these points - the widening of  the range of production - in 1913  thorange of production in tha United Kingdom was  very limited and  there  was no manufacture hore ofcartain classes of dyastuffs  of great importancosuch as the vat colours, and  in the case of  indigoonly the last stage of manufacture was carried outby a German  company importing advanced intermediates.In 1928 the  United Kingdom production of vatcolours amounted to 1.9 million lbs., and the outputof indigo was  over 9,0OC,0.;C  lbs., sufficiant  fortho  whole of  our requirements, and this was  entirely from home-produced intarmadiatas. Tha Committeestate that  of  tha  five outstanding devslopmants indyestu?fs chemistry in recent years thrae are british discovarias covero&quot;  by British patents -tha  most important from tha  sciantific andtechnical point o? view being dyestuffs
specifically designed for use on artificial, silk. . .As regards quality, the Committee say that whilstthere was reason for complaint in the early yearsof the Act;           &quot;the general opinion throughout the       colour-using industries is that the output  of       British makers now comparos very favourably       with that of tho foreign dyestuff producers       and that little ground for complaint as       regards quality now oxists. In certain       instances the quality of the British product       is an advance on foreign competitive material&quot;.     They attribute this result in large measure tothe &quot;patience and accommodation of the British usersin assisting them throughout the initial stages of the manufacture of thoir new products&quot;.     (6) nevertheless in spite of this progressthe Committee report that, whilst the development in this country may be considered satis factory fromthe point of view of quality, it still in respectof variety falls short of the position desired.The tendency has been in the main &quot;to concentrate on those materials for which thero is a comparativelylarge demand, whilst in those cases whore the consump-tion is relatively small,  the policy appearsto have been to leave theso to the foreign maker&quot;.The Committee point out that there are certain branches of tho textile industry w&apos; ich depend to agreat extent upon the novelty of the offectsprocurable, and in order to achieve those ondsspecialities are indispensable. And generally&quot;not many now colours in the sense that they havonot been manufactured anywhere else in the worldhava been includod in the British products, withthe exception of colours for the dyeing of varioust^rpos of artificial silk.&quot;
     (7) As regards prices,  the  Committee statethat the average price of dyostuffs  of all classesbefore the war was about Is. per lb.  In 1920it reached the very high level of 4/4d. per lb.At the end of 1928 it was l/6^d, per lb,  and since that date very considerable  reductions in theprices of dyestuffs have been made in thiscountry.  On this matter of  prico the Committeesay that the creation and maintenance under theAct of a substantial dye-making industry in thiscountry          &quot;has admittedly laid a serious burden      upon the colour-using  industries in the high      prices which have beon charged to them for dyo      wares during the early yoars of the operation      of the Act, and by some interference with their      access to the world&apos;s  markets  for their wares.      It is gratifying to record, however, that  tho      economic disadvantage  has been gradually      diminished, but it is  obvious  that any form of      restriction is a hindrance to the consuming      trades&quot;.     They also say that &quot;it  is gratifying to beable to report that latterly British prices fortheir range of colours have  approximated more orless to the general l3vel of prices  ruling on theContinent&quot;.  The Committee in support of this conclusion draw attention to the statement of theChairman of the Colour Users&apos; Association at thelast annual meeting of that  body that &quot;it is satisfactory to find that ths prices now rulingfor dyestuffs in this country are not substantially higher than thooe paid by users on theContinent;  In fact in several continental countries the prices are much higher.   in only two countries was it found that the averageprices were lower than in Great Britain, namely,Germany and Holland&quot;,  and the Committee statethat they understand that even in tha case of
 those two countries the difference in price was not substantial-      (8) The total number of persons employed in the industry was in 1928 approximately 7,200 including about 500 technical and research staff. Vith regard to these last the Committee point out thati      &quot;the dyestuffs industry, both from the   nature of the products themselves and the large   number required is a fundamentally complicated   industry.  It demands, if it is to compare   with Its continental equivalents, in all its   branches a highly scientific personnel and in   the training and evolution of this personnel   time is perhaps the greatest factor.  In the   first instance, whether for technical service   at home or abroad, for research work and the   control of manufacturing operations, the   industry has come to regard as a minimum   standard for its recruits an academic degree   which involves a 4 years&apos; University training.   Experience has shown that 4 to 5 years ,-ithin   the industry is required before the best   results can be expected.&quot;   And they go on to say that:      &quot;if the future of the industry is to be   secured it is essential that the number of   students entering Universities for training   in organic chemistry should be maintained.   Any marked diminution in this respect ^ould   be detrimental not only to the dyestuffs   industry itsolf but to the development of the   organic chemical industry as a whole in this   country*&quot;     They refer with satisfaction to the fact thatthe various manufacturers have been able to main-tain their research work on a fairly large scale and express their general approval of the lines on which research is being organised, though theythink that more might be done in respect of research of an original character and in regardto ancillary products of the colour-using industries, in the production of which continentalmakers are very active.
     (9)  The Committee refer to the  stress  whiohhas often been laid on &quot;the value and importanceof the dyestuff industry as a nucleus roundwhich a nation could logically develop other branches of organic chemistry&quot; and as examples of this process they point to the developmentof the use of organic chemical reagents in thevulcanisation of rubber which started less thana decade ago and has now become the general practice.    &quot;Products used for this purpose arecomplex in  character and varied in number andit is, the  Committee feels, satisfactory thatthis country is practically independent both asto range and quantity of foreign sources  ofsupply&quot;.  The Committee point  in addition to thedevelopment of the production  of substances used as softening agents in the  rubber industry and state that  the fine chemical  industry has alsobeen assisted by reason of  the development ofthe national dyestuffs industry.      (10) As regards the actual working of theAct, the Committee           &quot;have no hesitation  in stating that     tho close co-operation which has existed     between the dye users  and the dye manufacturer!?:     during the period of the  Act and the manner in     which the Act has been admiri3tered by the     Dyestuffs Advisory Licensing Committee have     together done much to  mitigate  the burden     placed on the colour-using  industries.  The     oonstitution  of the Dyestuffs Advisory     Licensing Committee, together with the co-     operation which has also  existed between that     Committee and the technical organisations  of     the colour users  and the  dye-makers onsured     the smooth and efficient  working of the      licensing system  and has  proved most useful      in  safeguarding  the interests of the user,     whilst at the same time  it has  afforded      sufficient inducement  to  the dye manufacturer.     to  develop his works  and  increase his efficiency.
      The general practice of the Committee has &quot;been to grant licences only in two cases:-  (a) where there is no British equivalent for the dye- stuff sought to he imported, and (h) where there is- such an equivalent &quot;but the price is so much higher than the continental price as to place the consumer at an undue competitive disadvantage. By an arrangement originally made between the dye- users and dye-makers in 1922 the consumers agreed that they would not press for the admission under licence of supplies of foreign dyestuffs solely on price grounds unless the price of the corresponding British product was more than three times the pre-war price and at the same time higher than the current foreign price.   This arrangement continues though the factor has been reduced from time to time and now stands at if.      (11) Though the licence system has on the whole worked with great smoothness the Committee recognise that some usert; have at times been subject to difficulties particularly in respect of the access to new colours.      (12) The Committee summarise their conclusions as follows           In the opinion of the Committee the      dyestuff industry to-day is in a very much      more satisfactory condition than it was at      the time the Dyestuffs Act was passed.  The      protection afforded by the Act has given      British manufacturers the necessary      confidence to develop their works and has      provided them with opportunities for acquiring      that sxcill and technique which is so necessary      for the production of dyestuffs of first      class quality and of consistent standards.      In addition, manufacturers have been enabled      to bring down their costs of production to      the lowest economic levels.
     The dyemaking industry of Great Britain,whilst it is well established, does not, however,provide for the full need of the colour using industries, and Users are dependent upon foreignsuppliers for Special Colours and Novelties.It would he a serious blow to British Users,were the flow of these products to be impairedin any way.     The question now arises whether it wouldbe possible for the industry to carry on that development and maintain its present positionwithout the protection afforded by the Act.There are two possible opinions on this.  the colour Users say the Act was for 10 years andno longer.   The Colour Makers say that theirincreased efficiency during the last few yearswarrants an extension of the .iet which wouldenable them to complete their work.   Further,the importance of the dye industry from thepoint of view of national security must not be overlooked, but from the point of view ofobtaining this object the burden should not belaid on the Colour Users.     Consequently it is to the interest of all parties concerned - that is the Government,the Users and the dyestuff manufacturers to continue to consider the problem in thesame spirit of co-operation that has markedthe period of the operation of the DyestuffsAct, and together to agree, if possible, firstwhether  any further assistance to the industryis necessary, and, if so, as to the form which such assistance should take.     (13) The Committee in the last paragraph but one quoted above refer to the importance of the dyestuffs industry from the point of view ofnational defence.   They have not elaborated this in their Report but the Secretary of State for war has informed me that his scientific advisers have brought to his notice the extent of our dependence on the dyestuffs industry for defence and theirfear &quot;that anything harmful to the dyes industry would be a blow at national safety in case ofemergency&quot;.   The position is that the industry  isan especially favourable training ground fororganic chemists, employing large numbers of research and process chemists whose training is necessarily such that they are especially adapted  to
3fbwork out new processes and carry on the manufacture ofany new chemical products required in an emergency,and that the plant employed in the production ofdyestuffs intermediates and dyestuffs (which is nowalmost wholly manufactured in this country)  is,unlike that employed in certain other branches ofohemioal industry, of a kind which lends itself and can be switched over quickly, to the production ofmany different substanoes, including explosives.Many dyea in the pure state and intermediates areof great importance in medicine and surgery;  foranalytical and microscopic purposes and forphotographic purposes, e.g., as sensitizers  inaerial work.     (14) There are two questions on which I wish to invite the opinion of my colleagues:-     (a) As to the publication of the&quot; Report.   TheCommittee expeot the Report to be published  and thatis desired also by all sections of the trade, bothproducers and oonsumers.  It is a oareful and balancedstatement of facts, and I propose to arrange for its early publication.     (b) As to the suggestion oontained in the last&apos;paragraph of the conclusions of the Committee set outin para.12.  I have discussed this recommendation withthe Chairman of the Development Committee who is ofopinion that, whilst as stated in the Report there hasbeen growing co-operation between producers  and consumers, there is still much more that could be donein this regard, whatever tho decision of the Governmentmay be as to the continuance or otherwise of the Act,and that it is possible that discussion of this kind
         may  lead to agreed recommendations.  I am disposed,         therefore, to adopt the suggestion and convene a         sipall informal  conference and if that course commends         Itself to my colleagues, I  suggest that a final         decision as to  policy  be deferred until we have the         results of that Conference  before us.  I would take         steps to seoure that the Conference reports to me         early in the autumn.                                            W.G.BOard of Trade,     11th July, 1930.
