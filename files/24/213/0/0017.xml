       COPY Off KSTTER PRO: I MINI.3T.IR OF TRANSPORT       TO THE&quot; OEijkll TO TIL;] LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL.                                  Ministry of Transport,                                     20th June, 1930.Sir,                   CHAINING CROSS ERIDGE SCHEMEc       I am directed by the Minister of Transport to refer to your letter of the 4th June,  E.33198, upon the subjectof the Charing Cross Bridge scheme, forwarding copies of reports cf the Parliamentary Committee and the ImprovementsCommittee, dated the 29th and 30th May respectively, which were adopted by the Council at their meeting  on the 3rd June,       The Minister notes that the Council have decided not  totake any steps in the direction of attempting to obtain therecommittal of the Charing Gross Bridge Bill by the House ofCommons, but, subject to the concurrence of the Minister, toappoint an Advisory Committee  to prepare and submit to theCouncil, within nine months, an agreed scheme  for a road bridge and approaches at Charing Cross, at an estimated cost notexceeding  12,500,000,        If the Advisors?&quot; Committee were able to agree on ascheme and to reach such agreement in nine months, its report would be received by  the Council in March 1931.  notwithstanding the agreement of the Advisory  Committee, it is, of course,possible that other representations may  be received and that further points may arise which it would  be necessary ts examine.The report would  then have to  be considered by  the Council andby  the Minister who would  feel bound  to  consult the London and home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee.
        The Minister,  of course,  appreciates that  underthe procedure proposed the Council hopes toy bringingall parties into close consultation to reduce disagreementsand delays, and that it may therefore not toe impossiblefor the Council to come to a decision to promote legislat-ion in the Parliamentary Session of 1931/38 toy the daterequired in its Standing Orders.   It will toe seen, however,that the earliest date toy which the Royal Assent is likelyto toe secured for the Council&apos;s Bill is the Summer of 1932or, roughly, two years from the present time.  TheCouncil&apos;s proposals thus involve that tooth the present andthe next session of Parliament are lost, and the Ministercannot tout confess to some concern at the time which must elapse under the Council&apos;s proposals in the most favourable circumstances before Parliamentary sanction  can toe securedto a Bill.        As the Council is aware. His Majesty&apos;s government attach great importance to the construction  of a CharingCross Bridge at the earliest practicable date, and theCouncil may be sure that their anxiety to see this improve-ment effected continues.  The Minister is not disposed tod.issent from a procedure which has commended itsel f to theCouncil, but in all the circumstances he does not considerthat he should himself appoint representatives to serve as members of the Advisory Committee, since, in view of thelarge traffic and financial considerations involved, he must toe free at the time the scheme is submitted to him toconsider it upon its merits and to examine it from thefinancial aspect, taking into account the position of theRoad Fund at that time.  I am, hov/ever, to assure you thathe will facilitate any investigation the Committee mayundertake toy putting at its disposal all the information and technical assistance available in the Ministry of
Transport.         Mr. Morrison notes the reference in the  last paragraph of the Report of the Improvements Committee  toWaterloo Bridge, from which he gathers that it is not intended to deal with Waterloo Bridge until parliamentary sanction is secured for a Road Bridge at Charing Cross.,He is aware of the concern which the state of waterloo bridge has long caused the Council and he assumes that ithas satisfied itself that the Bridge will he safe duringthe time contemplated by the Council before a CharingCross Bridge Bill is passed into law,                   I am                       Sir,                          Your obedient Servant,                           (Sgd.) CYRIL HuRCOMB.
