 imperial        1.  WITH reference to I. E. C. (30) 7th Meeting Minutes 3 (1) and I. E. C. (30) andfEoonComie 10th Meeting Minute 1 (2) the Committee had before them the Observations (Paper Conference,  E (B) (30) 22) by a Special Sub-Committee, presided over by the Lord Chancellor, on Committee?  the Report (Paper I. E. C. (30) 72) submitted by the Inter-Departmental Committee Nationality  on Inter7Imperial Relations. and Marr dHyof     THE COMMITTEE agreed to consider in connection with the general question Women.    the question  of the  nationality of married women, and had before them  the Report          (Paper  I. E. C. (30)  84) of the  Inter-Departmental Committee  on  Inter-Imperial          Relations covering  the Report  of a special Sub-Committee set up to examine and          report upon  the question of the  nationality of married  women.  This  Report sets          out (Part I)  the present position of the problem, summarises (Part  II)  the history          of the movement  for reform, discusses (Part III) the political and legal considera-          tions  involved in giving effect to the demands of the Women&apos;s Organisations and          examines (Part IV) the action that might be taken.  For  convenience of reference          Part IV of the Report is attached hereto as Appendix I.              In  Paper E  (B) (30) 22 the  Lord Chancellors Committee suggested the desir-          ability of formulating some solution of the general question, which, without involving          the complete break-up of the existing body of British nationality law, might prove          acceptable to those Dominions (and in particular the Irish Free State) which, at the          Operation of Dominion Legislation  Conference  took  what has been  called  the          &quot; extreme view.&quot;   It was  proposed (paragraph 6) that this end  might be attained          by combining &apos;&apos; the  principles of British and Dominion nationality in a single enact-          ment  in each Dominion which desires to have a nationality of its own as well  as a          common (British)  nationality.   In  this  way British  nationality  and  Dominion          nationality would become to a  certain extent  interdependent.  The enactment  con-          templated  would consist of two parts.   The  first part  would  define Dominion          nationals as persons  owing  allegiance  to  His Majesty  in  common  with all other          subjects of His Majesty as defined in  the second part and possessing certain special          qualifications as to  birth, residence in the  Dominion, etc., which connect them with          that Dominion.  The second part would contain (with any necessary modifications)          the existing  provisions of the  law  relating to the acquisition and loss of British          nationality and Imperial naturalization and would thus define the  common status          in terms which are identic throughout the Commonwealth.&quot;              It was also proposed (paragraph  8) that to meet the objection of the Irish Free          State to the use of the expression &quot; British subject &quot; the expression &quot; subject of His          Majesty &quot; should be used in the legislation which is contemplated and that &quot; British          subject  &quot; should be  re-defined in the British Nationality Act so as to include persons          who are &quot; subjects of His Majesty &quot; under  the new legislation. This definition might          be to the effect that &quot;the  expression &apos; British subject&apos;  when used in.any Statute,          shall be deemed to be  the equivalent of the expression &apos; subject of  His Majesty &apos; and          shall include any person who is a subject of His Majesty in virtue of any Dominion          statute.&quot;              In  conclusion (paragraph 9) the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Sub-Committee expressed the          opinion that pending some indication of the intention of the &quot; Extreme &quot; Dominions          the Government  of the United  Kingdom should  avoid putting forward definite          proposals at the Conference.              In  the  course  of  considerable  discussion  doubts  were expressed as to  the          possibility of  securing  the unanimous acceptance by  all  the Dominions of  the          compromise suggested by the Lord Chancellors  Committee.   With regard to the          question of the nationality of married women the Committee were reminded that the          Dominions were acutely divided  on this subject.   The view was generally accepted          that even if, as is improbable, the suggestions in the concluding paragraph of Paper          I. E. C. (30) 84 were adopted by the Conference, it w7as very unlikely that this solution          would be accepted by the House of Commons and it was important that this difficulty          should  be frankly explained to the Conference.  The Committee examined various          possible alternative proposals to  the suggestions in the  documents before them, but          all these proposals  were found to be open to objections at least as grave as those          raised to the proposals recommended for adoption in the  Reports., Nationality.       THE COMMITTEE agreed-               1. (a)  To take note of and approve the various  suggestions  on the general                     question of nationality, contained in the Report of the Lord Chancellor &apos;s                     Committee (Paper E. (B) (30) 22) and summarised above.  In particular,                     to approve the procedure indicated in paragraph 9, viz., that no definite
       proposals should be put  forward at the Conference until it  has been       ascertained whether it will be possible to press for the maintenance of       the status quo, and,  if not, whether, and if so,  when  the alternative       proposal in paragraph 6 of the Observations should be put forward.1. (b) To approve the circulation of Paper E. (B) (30) 22 as a  Brief for the       use of United Kingdom Representatives at the Conference.2. (1) To approve, as a basis of the policy to be adopted by the United       Kingdom Representatives at the Conference, the following conclusions       and suggestions contained in Paper I.E.C. (30) 84, as summarised  in the       concluding paragraphs of the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s covering       Report, viz. :            (a) If unanimity is  obtained on  the larger  question of Common-       wealth-wide nationality on  a  new basis, it should not  be  impossible to       treat the narrower question of the nationality of married  women  on its       own merits and within whatever framework was thus agreed upon.           (&amp;) If such a unanimous agreement is not possible, and it is decided       to leave the present  position  substantially  unchanged, His Majesty&apos;s       Government in the United Kingdom should not  initiate legislation       tending to  break up  the existing unity of  nationality  legislation in       the Commonwealth, but they should only proceed in the  matter of giving       effect to the women&apos;s demands to such extent as they can carry the       Dominion Governments with them.          For this purpose it was decided that (while indicating the willing-       ness of the United Kingdom Government to  meet  the women&apos;s demands       if all  parts of the Commonwealth were agreed),  the first step to take       would be  to endeavour to obtain unanimous agreement that legislation       should be  passed to give effect to Articles 8-10 of the Hague Nationality       Convention, referred  to in  I.E.C. (30) 84,  paragraph 25.  If,  after       discussion of  those Articles, it  appeared that there was a prospect of       agreement on the wider  principle adopted unanimously by the House       of Commons in 1925 (namely,  that a British woman should not lose her       nationality by the mere act of marriage with a foreigner), an attempt       should  be made to persuade  Dominion Governments to accept this       principle.   If this major principle could be agreed to unanimously, it       might also  be possible to secure  Dominion agreement to the further       proposal of the Women&apos;s Organisation that  a foreign woman shall not       acquire British nationality without her consent on marriage to a British       subject.          As any step in  the direction of  giving  effect  to  the  women&apos;s       demands  without  the  full  concurrence of the  Dominions  would       undoubtedly be a step in the direction of breaking up the Imperial unity       of nationality, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United  Kingdom should       not themselves initiate any legislation tending to this result.2. (2) That the United Kingdom Representatives should frankly explain that       it was doubtful whether any United  Kingdom Government could  carry       legislation through the House  of  Commons and  which  did  not sub-       stantially meet  the women&apos;s demands  that  acceptance by the United       Kingdom Representatives  at the Conference of any new proposal must be       subject to whatever decision  Parliament may hereafter reach on the       question.2.-(3)  To approve the printing  of Paper I.E.C. (30) 84  as a Brief for the use       of the United  Kingdom Representatives at the Conference.Nationality ofMarriedWomen.    2.   THE COMMITTEE had before them a Memorandum (Paper I.E.C. (30) 85)  Certainby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs covering a despatch from the Irish  QuestionsFree State regarding four questions : (1) Appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council;(2) The right of direct access to the King by all his Governments;(3) The position of the Members of the Commonwealth in  relation to treaty      making, with special reference to the inter se application of treaties;(4) Communications between His Majesty&apos;s Governments other than the British      Government and foreign Governments;raised by theIrish FreeState.
          which the Irish Free State intend to raise  at the Conference.  The Memorandum          pointed out that these points  are  largely  covered in the various Briefs already          submitted to the Policy Committee and the conclusions of the Committee thereon.              With regard to the question of Appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy          Council, the Memorandum expressed the view that it would seem that ultimately it          will be necessary to accede to the desire of the Irish Free State that Appeals from          the Irish Free State to the Judicial Committee should be discontinued, and  at the          same time set out the special difficulties which such a step would involve in the case          of the Irish Free State by reason of the terms of the Treaty and the Free State          Constitution.              It was pointed out  that  this  question covered  Appeals falling into three          categories, namely :                 (i)  Appeals in cases of inter-governmental disputes.               (ii)  Appeals in cases of private litigation.              (iii)  Appeals in cases of private litigation which raise constitutional issues.              In the course of discussion the Prime Minister expressed the view that no United          Kingdom Government could survive which attempted to reverse the provisions of the          Irish Treaty and the Free State Constitution in this  respect.   The whole question          was one of great difficulty, but he trusted that the United Kingdom delegation would          at the  Conference receive strong Dominion support  for the  policy which it was          proposed to adopt  and which is  summarised  in I.E.C.  (30), 5th  Conclusions,          Minutes 5 and 6.              In regard  to the remaining  three questions discussed  in  I.E.C.  (30) 85, the          Committee took note of and approved the comments of the Secretary  of State for          Dominion Affairs contained in  that document.              THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS undertook to j          confer with the Minister for External Affairs of the Irish Free State with regard to j          the question of  presentation of Letters of Credence.                              \              THE COMMITTEE  agreed-                  To authorise the  reproduction of I.E.C. (30)  85 as a Brief for the  use of              United Kingdom Ministers at the Conference.rme Law        3.   jn pursuance of I.E.C. (30), 11th Meeting, Minute 12,  THE COMMITTEEprocedure.    had before them a  Memorandum (Paper I.E.C.  (30) 60)  prepared by the  Legal f          Sub-Committee  of   the  Imperial   Conference  (Foreign   Policy and  Defence)          Sub-Committee,   entitled   Prize  Law  and Prize  Courts.   The  Memorandum j          considered  separately   (1) the constitution and  jurisdiction  of Prize  Courts; 1          (2) appeals in Prize Cases;  (3) the Law which Prize Courts  administer;  (4) the I          functions of the Procurator-General;  and  (5)  the disposition of the prize  fund.          It was pointed  out that  in any  discussion of these  subjects two points must be          constantly borne in mind.   Firstly, it is only in the event of Dominion participation          in a common war that the various questions discussed in the Memorandum will arise          in practice, for where there is no participation, whether active  or passive, it is clear          that  there  can be no question of the establishment  of  any Prize Court in that ;          Dominion which is standing aloof.  Second^, if the Navies of  the British Common-          wealth, in the  future as in the  past, operate under a single command, some at least          of the problems connected with the future administration of prize law will be seen          to solve themselves.   For convenience of reference the conclusions and recommenda- 1          tions of the Legal Sub-Committee are attached as Appendix II.              In paragraph 37A of  the Memorandum  it was stated that India is not included          in the arrangements proposed, and that it is assumed that for the time being existing          arrangements will continue to apply in India, while in paragraph 37B reference was          made to  observations by  the Admiralty on certain of the issues involved in the          question of Prize set out in Appendix II thereto.              THE COMMITTEE were informed by the First Lord of the Admiralty that          the proposals would involve legislation, but no serious opposition to such legislation ;          was anticipated.
THE COMMITTEE agreed-(1)  To adopt the conclusions and recommendations set out in paragraph 38 of      Paper I.E.C. (30) 60 (Appendix II hereto) as a basis for the policy to be      followed by the  United Kingdom  Representatives at the Conference in      regard to the questions of Prize Law and Prize Courts.(2)  That it should be assumed for the time being that the existing arrangements      will continue to apply in India, and that accordingly India should not be      included in the arrangements proposed in LEU. (30) 60.(3)  To authorise the printing of LEU.  (30) 60 as a Brief for the use of the      United Kingdom Representatives at the Conference.    4.

The principalclauses  for the  proposed  Supplemental Charter  are set out  in  the  concluding paper of this Memorandum.THE COMMITTEE agreed-    To approve the Memorandum in question (subject to the examination fromthe legal and administrative points of view by the Departments concerned)  for circulation to the Conference for consideration.    6.

APPENDIX  I.                       NATIONALITY  OF MARRIED WOMEN.    Part  IV. Report  of Sub-Committee  of Inter-Departmental Committee^                            SUGGESTED PROCEDURE.    EROM the foregoing survey of the considerations involved, we think that thefollowing  conclusions may be drawn with some degree of certainty :     (a) that most of the general public in this country are indifferent or neutral on.           this question and, apart from the criticisms which are sure to be directed           against any  fundamental alteration of the present position by members.           of the legal profession, active opposition to the women&apos;s demands is           likely  to be found only in a comparatively small section of religious and           conservative  opinion;    (b) that, on the other hand, any attempt to give effect to the women&apos;s demands           in full would (in  the  present state  of Dominion opinion)  lead  to  the           disruption of the common corpus of nationality law within the British           Commonwealth;  and  would  also  create certain  serious  international           administrative difficulties;    (c) that the  incorporation of the principle  embodied in  the  articles  of  the           convention signed at The Hague represents the greatest common measure           of agreement possible of  attainment to-day though  it  must  be noted           that this would not satisfy the Women&apos;s Organisations;    id) that any attempt to advance beyond these  articles may well result in the&apos;           sacrifice of advantages enjoyed to-day by all British subjects, for the           sake of  carrying out  to its logical conclusion the general principle of           equality  of  the sexes, a  principle which is now  almost universally           admitted in  theory, if not completely in  practice.    What then can be done ?    It is clear that the answer  to this question depends very largely upon what happens at the Imperial Conference,  when the discussions on the larger question of nationality within the British Commonwealth take place.  If unanimous agreement can be obtained  for the establishment of  a Commonwealth-wide nationality on  anew basis, it should be  possible to treat the narrower question of  the nationality of married women on its own merits and within whatever framework is decided.  we feel, however, that the chances of reaching such  a unanimous conclusion are slender,and the practical result of the  discussions  may well be a  compromise  resolutionleaving the present position substantially unchanged so far as definite legislative proposals  are concerned; and, should this prove to be the  case, presumably,  HisMajesty&apos;s Government  in the United Kingdom would continue  their endeavours tomaintain  unimpaired  the  uniform  international  status of all British subjects.In such  circumstances it  will be of the utmost  importance that  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom should not initiate nationality legislation onthis subject, which, in view of the attitude of the Dominions, would,  if passed by the parliament at Westminster, have to  be confined to those British subjects for whomthat  Parliament can legislate,  and would thus introduce, so far as  they  were concerned, different criteria of nationality from the criteria governing the status ofBritish subjects belonging to  other parts of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions.  Indeed, weanticipate that there might be considerable technical difficulties in framing suchan act.     It is  clear, therefore,  that unless and  until the whole  corpus of  british nationality  law  is broken up into several independent nationalities, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom can only  give  effect to the demands of theWomen&apos;s  Organisations in  so  far  as they can  carry the Governments  of theDominions with  them.   To what exact measures it will be  possible to obtain suchconsent it is difficult to foresee.   There is some chance that unanimous  agreement could be  reached on proposals to amend existing legislation so  as to give effect tothe articles contained in the Convention on Nationality recently signed at The Hague* I.E.C. (80), 84.
(see paragraph 24).  Such proposals, if adopted, would abolish most of the cases of practical hardship, particularly  since under  Article  8 no British woman  wouldbecome stateless by reason only of marriage.   To  this extent acceptance of theseproposals should be regarded as a real advance in the right direction, but they would undoubtedly be deemed quite inadequate by the  Women&apos;s Organisations, who are mainly influenced by methods of logic and theoretical principle.    Further progress would necessitate  an endeavour  to secure the assent  of theDominion Governments to the principle underlying the House of Commons resolution of 1925 (see paragraph 18 of I.E.C. (30) 84), namely, that a  British woman  shouldnot lose her nationality  by  the mere act of marriage with an alien.  We cannotestimate  what will  be  the  effect  of  the political pressure  which  the  Women&apos;organisations  will bring to  bear upon the Dominion delegates, but, on the evidence before us, there is small hope of inducing the Union of South Africa and the IrishFree State to consent to amending legislation in this direction;  but we feel that HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United  Kingdom would be fully justified  in usingevery endeavour to persuade  the Dominion Governments to agree to such legislation.    If it should be possible to secure unanimous agreement to the proposal referredto in  the preceding paragraph, we think it probable that the Dominions would beprepared also to agree to the  second proposal set out in paragraph 15 of Paper I.E.C.(30) 84, namely, that an alien woman shall not, without her consent,  become Britishon marriage to a British subject.    It might  be added  that it  would  be  possible to  remove the  existing civildisabilities imposed in the United Kingdom on a woman of British  origin marriedto an alien to which  reference is made  in paragraph 29 of Paper  I.E.C. (30) 84without necessarily making  any  alteration  in the  existing nationality law.   Thiswould not, however, it is understood, satisfy the Women&apos;s Organisations, who might even resist any such proposal on the ground that it would interfere with their efforts to secure full recognition for the principle of equality.    Beyond these suggestions we have not felt able to  go, since any further step inthe direction of giving effect to the  women&apos;s demands would, in the present state ofDominion opinion, undoubtedly  lead to a break-up  of  the  Imperial  unity of nationality.  Whether or not such a break-up is inevitable, we feel that we cannottoo strongly stress our  recommendation that  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in theUnited Kingdom should not  themselves initiate any legislation tending to this result.APPENDIX II.                        PRIZE LAW AND PRIZE  COURTS.      Conclusions and Recommendations of Report of Legal Sub-Committee.                            (Paper I.E.C. (30) 60.)    ON the assumption that the Dominions will not be satisfied that the existingstate of things should continue, the following is a summary of our conclusions andrecommendations.  If, on the other hand, any particular Dominion desires to make no change, there is no reason why the old and the new system should not exist side by side:     (1)  That the present position whereby Prize Courts throughout His Majesty&apos;s          Dominions exercise jurisdiction  by virtue of Commissions issued only on          the advice of Ministers in the United Kingdom is  inconsistent with the          new constitutional status of the Dominions.    (2)  That the establishment  of  Prize Courts in the Dominions  and the juris-          diction which they exercise  must  in future  depend primarily  upon          Dominion legislation.    (3)  That a Prize Court sitting in one part  of the British Commonwealth by          virtue of a commission issued on the advice of Ministers only in that partI          could not as a matter of constitutional  propriety, exercise jurisdiction          in respect of captures effected  by  vessels controlled, by  and operating          under the orders of the Government of another  part, unless it has the          authority of that other Government  to do so.
 (4)  That appeals from all Prize Courts throughout His Majesty&apos;s Dominions       should continue to lie to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. (5)  That arrangements should be  made whereby a Prize  Court sitting in one       part of the British Commonwealth should, within the limits prescribed       by international law, recognise the executive orders issued by the Govern-       ment of another part as  affording a good ground  for condemnation of       captures effected in pursuance of such orders. (6)  That,  so far as possible,  Prize Court Rules of Procedure should in future       only be settled after consultation among all the Governments concerned       and on a uniform basis. (7)  That every Prize Court should continue to have power to remit or  transfer       cases to a Prize Court  sitting elsewhere in His  Majesty&apos;s dominions       where circumstances make such a course desirable. (8)  That proceedings in Prize should be instituted in all cases  by an officer of       the Government whose naval forces have effected the capture which is the       subject  of the proceedings. (9)  That the final allocation of the proceeds of condemned prizes must remain       a matter for agreement between the Governments concerned,  but that       they should be paid in the first instance into the Exchequer of the country       where the decree of condemnation is pronounced, to be held there at the       disposal of the Government whose naval forces have effected the  capture.(10)  That droits of Admiralty condemned in a Prize Court should also be paid       into the Exchequer of the country where  the  Prize Court  sits,  the       question whether  they ought to become the absolute property of the       Government of that country being a matter for further consideration.(11)  That legislation should be enacted in the United Kingdom            (a)  Confirming the right of the Crown to  issue  a Commission to any       Prize Court sitting in the United Kingdom or in any colony authorising       the Court to exercise jurisdiction in Prize  in  respect  of any matter       arising out of captures by the  Royal Navy;           (o)  Providing for the issue of further Commissions authorising the       exercise of jurisdiction in respect of any matters  arising out of captures       by the naval forces of the Dominion, if the Dominion Government has       requested that such a  Commission should issue;           (c)  Empowering His  Majestj^s Government in the United Kingdom       (1)  to request the  Governments of the Dominions to issue analogous       Commissions to their own Prize Courts, and (2) to authorise by Order in       Council the institution of  proceedings by the prescribed officer in respect       of captures  effected by  the Royal  Navy in  the Prize Court  of any       Dominion which has acceded to such a request;           (d)  Authorising  the  institution of  Prize  Courts in  the  United       Kingdom and in the Colonies by an officer nominated by the Dominion       Government concerned of proceedings in Prize arising out of captures  by       Dominion naval forces;           (e)  Requiring Prize  Courts in the  United  Kingdom and in the       Colonies to  recognize, within the limits prescribed by international law,       executive orders issued by the  Government of a Dominion as  affording a       good ground for condemnation of captures effected in pursuance of such       orders;           (/)  Directing that the proceeds of prizes condemned in a Prize Court       in the United Kingdom and in the Colonies at the  instance of a Dominion       Government shall be paid into the Exchequer, to  be held at the disposal       of the Dominion Government.(12)  That the Dominions should be invited to pass legislation            (a)  Making provision, mutatis mutandis, on lines similar to (a), (b),       (c), (d), (e) and (/) above;           (b)  Providing for an  appeal to the Privy  Council from all decisions       of Dominion Prize Courts;           (c)  Authorising  Dominion Prize  Courts  to  remit  or  transfer       proceedings  to any Prize  Court sitting  elsewhere  in  His Majestv&apos;s       Dominions.

APPENDIX I.                 Draft Message of  Greeting to Their Majesties.    The Prime Ministers  and other Representatives of the Governments of theBritish  Empire assembled  in  Conference, at their first meeting and as their firstofficial act,  desire to present their  respectful duty  to  the King.   They join inthankfulness for Your Majesty&apos;s restoration to health and earnestly hope that your majesty and Her Majesty  the Queen may be spared for many years  to inspire the feelings  of  love  and  affection which unite  all the  peoples of  the BritishCommonwealth of Nations in allegiance to the Crown.                                 APPENDIX II.Suggested Heads of the Prime Ministers  Business  Statement at the end of  the               First Day&apos;s Meeting, Wednesday, October 1, 1930.    1.  Memorandum on Publicity and Joint Secretariat has been circulated.  Hopethat suggestions will be generally agreed.    2.  Publication of opening speeches.  If it is agreed to publish, very desirablethat proofs should be returned to the Secretariat not  later than 4  P.M. to-day, witha view to immediate publication.    3.  Memorandum  on  Procedure  and Agenda.  Hope suggestions  generally agreed and  if agreed it  would be  convenient  if nominations could be sent  toSecretaries.    4.  With regard to future business, I would suggest     (a) that  we might have a meeting this afternoon at 10,  Downing Street,  at          3 P.M., to discuss how best to deal with the constitutional issues.  I would          suggest,  if this  is generally agreed,  that each Prime Minister should be          accompanied  at  this  meeting  by  his   principal  Delegates  on   the          constitutional side, including advisers as  he thinks fit. May I  remind          you that the accommodation at No. 10, Dowing Street is very limited?    (&amp;) that, in view of the number of subjects to be  considered, it is important to          set up the  General Economic Committee without  delay and I would          propose Sir Sydney Chapman as Chairman, as he was in 1926.  I suggest          that this Committee should have its opening meeting this afternoon at          3 P.M. at the Board of Trade (large  Conference Room).    (c) I propose that the Conference in Committee  on the Economic  side should          meet here to-morrow at 10-30 A.M.    5.  One last point.  The United Kingdom  is charged with  representing certain parts of the Empire not separately represented  at the  Conference.  I would propose,therefore, that the  procedure adopted  in 1926 should be  followed, and that  theSecretary of  State  for Dominion Affairs  should  have the assistance of Mr. Fynn,Treasurer of  Southern  Rhodesia, who is at present visiting this country, and of  SirFrancis Newton, the High  Commissioner  for Southern Rhodesia, in matters wherethe interests of Southern Rhodesia are concerned; this  will apply in particular tosome of the economic questions to be dealt with in  committee.    As regards  the Colonies and Protectorates, the Secretary of  State for  theColonies, as a member of  the United Kingdom  delegation, will  be charged  withrepresenting their interests  with such expert  assistance as may be found desirable.
