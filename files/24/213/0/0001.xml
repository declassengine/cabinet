SIS-DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).                                                        Copy No.  -?: /jiCRET                                                              /,.Po20l(30).                 CABINET.                           BIM CONTROL.                   Memorandum by Minister  of Health..    1.    In  October last  I  submitted, a memorandum on this  subject,    iG.P.269(29)],  with particular  reference to  the question whether    information as.  to methods of birth control can properly be    given  at Maternity and  Child Welfare Centres and Ante-Natal    Centres  which are supported by  public  funds.   I stated that  I    proposed to follow the  policy which had been adopted by my    predecessors (of  all  parties) as embodied in the following    paragraphs:-         (i)   The Maternity and Child Welfare Centre should deal  only              with  the expectant and nursing mother (and infant)  and              not with the  married  or unmarried  woman  contemplating              the application of contraceptive methods.        Cii)   It is not  the function of an Ante-Natal  Centre or              Maternity and Child Welfare  Centre to give advice in              regard  to birth control, and exceptional cases in which              the avoidance of pregnancy seems desirable on medical              grounds should be referred by the  Medical Officer of              the Centre  for particular advice to a private              practitioner  or hospital.    2.   This  memorandum  was considered on the 16th October, when    my proposals were approved by my colleagues  (C.38(29)  Co^.5)    and  it was agreed that, if I were pressed on the subject in the    House  of Commons, I  should have authority to announce  that in oases    where  there were  medical grounds for giving  advice to  married    women  on contraceptive  methods, it should be given, but that    such advice would be  limited to cases  where  pregnancy  would be    detrimental to  health.   The question  has not yet  bean raised in    the  House  of Commons  in such a  form as to call for an  announcement
of that kind.3.   The subject of birth control has however again come beforeme in connection with the question of the powers of LocalAuthorities to establish either (1) separate birth controlclinics, or (2) gynaecological clinics at which advice and information as to contraceptive methods would be given tothose who attend the clinics, and I desire to consult mycolleagues as to the policy which should be adopted in dealingwith proposals for the exercise of these powers.4.   I am advised that Local Authorities have no general powerto establish birth control clinics as such, but that underthe Notification of Births (Extension) Act, 1915, which enables Local Authorities to exercise the powers of the PublicHealth Acts for the purpose of the care of expectant mothersand nursing mothers, it may properly be held that they can provide birth control clinics for these limited classes ofwomen.   ivioreover, under the Public Health Acts, LocalAuthorities may provide clinics at which medical advice and treatment would be available for any woman suffering fromgynaecological conditions.5.   The exercise of these powers is not made subject to mysanction by the relevant statutes, and it may be that some local Authorities will proceed to provide gynaecological clinicsor even birth control clinics without reference to my Department.But in other oases Local Authorities may desire to borrow money for the provision of such clinics and apply to my department for sanction to loans, while in one case which is at presentbefore me the Local Authority propose to erect a gynaecologicalclinic on a site which can only be used for that purpose with my sanction.   In that case  it is evident- from the information supplied by the Local Authority that they intend that the
7medical staff of the clinic shall give birth control advice to any woman attending the clinic who needs or asks for such advice.6*   The question on whioh I desire to consult my colleaguesis whether, and if so, on what conditions, it would be desirablethat I should sanction loans, or appropriations of sites, forsuch purposes.   In these cases one of the principal objectionsto the use of Maternity and Child Welfare Centres for the giving of birth control advice - namely, that such a use would damage the proper work of the Centres ** does not apply, but atthe same time any Departmental sanction to the establishmentof birth control clinics, or gynaecological clinics which wouldalso be used for purposes of birth control, would be regardedas committing the Government to approval of the expenditure ofpublic funds for those purposes.7.   I am advised that there is probably a need in certain areas for the establishment of gynaecological clinics, and Ido not consider therefore that I should be justified in with-holdlng any Departmental sanction that may be necessary to theprovision of such clinics by Local Authorities.  But under thePublic Health Acts these clinics can be provided only for the reception of the sick, and I should propose to make it acondition of my sanction (1) that the clinics would be availableonly for women who are in need of medical advice and treatment for gynaecological conditions, and (2) that advice on contra-ceptive methods would be given only to married women who attend the clinics for medical advice or treatment and in whose casespregnancy would be detrimental to health.   The latter&apos;conditionwould be in accordance with the previous Cabinet decision onthis subject.8.   The oase of the birth control clinic for expectant mothersand nursing mothers is more difficult.   A Local authority may contend that as they have power to provide such a clinic                              -3-
   and  to arrange  for birth  control  advice  to be  given at the  clinic   to all women In these  classes  who ask  for it,  the Government   Department  whose function is limited to  sanctioning the   borrowing of money for the establishment of  the  clinic ought   not  to interfere with  the discretion of  the  Looal Authority.   But  it is clear that the  Government oould not  disclaim   responsibility  If a  loan were  sanctioned for such a purpose,  and   in view of  the  acute division  of  opinion in  all  three political   parties on  the  subject of birth control, I  should propose  to   refuse to sanction loans  for birth oontrol  clinics for expectant   mothers and nursing  mothers except on  condition  that  contraceptive   advice would be given  only in  cases where further pregnancies   would be detrimental to health.   9* 1  The course I have suggested  can be  justified on  the ground   that to the extent to  which birth control advice Is needed in   the  interests of health it would  be wrong for the Ministry of   Health to withhold any sanction that may be  necessary.   But  it   seems desirable.to maintain the position that without express   directions  from Parliament the Government will not  sanction the   expenditure of  public  money for the provision of facilities   for giving  birth control advice to any woman who may  ask for  it.   10.   It is  necessary to add that  if loans are sanctioned for  these   clinics subject to the conditions which I have suggested,  it  will   nevertheless be difficult to ensure that those conditions  are   always observed, and it is clear that  the purposes  for which  the   clinics are used must  depend to some extent on the  discretion of   the  medical staffs of the clinics who  will  be responsible  for   deciding In what oases there are  medical grounds for  giving birth   control advice.   But  if the conditions are definitely  laid down   when loans  are  sanctioned, the Government would  be  able  to disclaim   responsibility for any actions of the  Local Authorities  or their   medical officers which infringed those conditions.Hth June, 1930.
