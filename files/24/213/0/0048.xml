Secret.                    APPEN1IX   Telegram from  Secretary  of  State for India to Viceroy, dated                         11th  July 1950.               2247.   Private and personal.  Cabinet are actively  considering  the  question of the participation of the Opposition Parties  in the Conference (see correspondence ending with your private and personal telegram, of 7th May, 330-S). What follows  is a summary of my attempt to formulate the pros and  cons  and   I should he grateful for your comments at your earliest  possible convenience.               The   three-Party truce in Indian matters I understand to  he that questions of Indian policy are to he free from subjection to the exigencies of Party politics at home; that  debates on Indian policy should he conducted   in a non- partisan manner, and that, for this purpose,  information is to he pooled so far  as possible and free consultation take place between all Parties.               Pursuant t* this understanding the practice since 1919 has been  for the Government of the day  to consult ths Opposition or  Oppositions on high Indian questions, the Government retaining unimpaired responsibility for deciding onthe action to be taken.   The practice  has  never gone beyondconsultation with the Opposition Parties;  for it would be constitutionally impossible  for the  Government of the day toaccept responsibility for action resulting from a policy imposed on it by the non-responsible Party in Opposition.              The  outstanding example  of three-Party co-operation is found in the composition  of the  Simon Commission.But this body v/as  purely consultative,  and when the proposition                                                       of
 of  three-Party  co-operation is considered in relation to the Hound  Table  Conference an entirely new set of considerations has to  be  borne  in mnnd.  For the Conference is to be definitive in   so  far as,  on agreement reached at it, will be founded the proposals  which  are subsequently t^ be laid before Parliament; and it  is  only  the Government possessing executive responsibility which can  decide on the proposals to be submitted to Parliament. Therefore, when  decisions have to be taken at the Conference, the responsibility must rest with His Majesty&apos;a Government. If  they carry the Oppositions with them, so much the better; but  they cannot accord to Opposition representatives what amounts to the executive function of taking a decision or vetoeing a decision which would otherwise be taken by HisMajesty&apos;s  Government.  In  fact, the views of Opposition representatives would b? liable to be over-ruled  at the Conference Consequently, if the Oppositions are represented at the Conferencethey can only occupy an unofficial position.                The advantages of including them in such capacity would bet-     fa)   they would be forcibly educated at first hand as to        Indian demands;     fb)   they would also he able to present forcibly to Indians        opinions held by the Oppositions;     (c)   to such  extent as Indian presentation of their claim        convinced tho Opposition representatives present, there        would be corresponding premise that these demands would        be accepted later by Parliament;     -:-)           The disadvantages are that     (1)  the presentation of Opposition views in the Conference        would render agreement more difficult;  and     (2)  Indian  leaders, foreseeing this difficulty, would be        deterred from attending Conference.
A o crHadTelegram from Viceroy,  dated 14th July,   1930.629-Li.              Private and personal.  Your private and personal telegram of the 11th instant, 2247.  As you know, I have always been conscious of very great importance of securingthe maximum co-operation of the Opposition Parties with indian policy and I hope that you will  find it p possible toarrange procedure by which this may be effected.  I am notunaware of the difficulties in tha way.  To include membersof the Opposition Parties in the Conference would mean asubstantial alteration of the original announcement and indian opinion has always anticipated the Conference was to be,as stated, between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Indians.  Ithink it safer to leave this idea in the minds of the Indiansand to continue to let it be understood that Conference would                                                    beThis last point was put in your telegram of the 7thMay with much force- and this difficulty can, I think, only he overcomeif any announcement that Opposition Parties are to &quot;berepresented at the Conference is accompanied &quot;by a clear statement that Government, if convinced toy the Indian case, would not be deterred by disagreement of the Opposition members fromproceeding to lay before Parliament proposals based on agreementbetween itself and Indians irrespective of the Opposition view.This, I think, is as far as Government could go, and would preserve the spirit of the three-Party arrangement which hasprevailed till now in the consultative sphere.
                                                          /2 ** x*                                                          li 6 o                                                             4.be held on this basis.  At ore sent juncture,  at any rate,  itwould be dangerous to make any announcement  to the effectthat the Opposition Parties were to be included in theConferonce and it might have tho effect of changing for the worse the general political tone out here which I think showssome signs of becoming more moderate.                 2*  But these dangers and difficulties donot diminish my desire to see the Opposition Parties in someway brought it.  I have given a great deal cf thotight as towhat alternative courses are open to us to achieve the desiredobject of giving the Opposition leaders opportunity of influencing, by themselves meeting Indian Leaders.  If theyarj not to he members of the Conference as such the problem is how best to associate them with its work. One way of doing this would be to avoid any&apos; suggestion that the opposition parties should attend the formal meetings of the Conferonce, butto arrange informal meetings from time to time between them andselected Indian delegates.  I do not think it would he difficult-to convince the Indians that they have everything to gain by meeting the Opposition Loaders inthis way, and I thinktho Opposition Leaders might thomslcves find this a lets tediousand more direct method for their discussion than by attending theConference itself.  It might evon ho a good thing if some kindo&apos;f standing conference between all parties in England could goOn, concurrently with the Indian Conference, discussing at frequent intervals the material which emerge s from  the latter.If it wore possible to do soptjkhing of this sort, it might bepossible, as things develop, to effect contact between the round Table Conference and members of tho Opposition.                 3.  Au regards present tactics, howove-r, mystrong feeling is that you should av^id mentioning tho question                                                          at
at all.   I am certain that, at this stage, it would &quot;be misunderstood hero and would do harm.  I learn that during present session apprehensions have &quot;been expressed &quot;by certain Indians inthe Lobby on this very matter.  This feeling will be intensifiedby article in &quot;Sunday Times&apos;5 quoted by Reuter, that Oppositionare now pressing Government for their inclusion in Conference.I can hardly doubt, however, when Indians get Home, theywill very soon realise the necessity of getting in touchwith other Parties in England.  My advice therefore would be to wait for them to arrive in London and then to convince them ofadvantage    some such informal, but, from your point of View,effective procedure as I have outlined.  I h*pe very much thatyou will be ablo to persuade Opposition Parties that this methodholds out best promise of success.  My only desire, as I knowit is yours,  is to see them associated in the Conference ina manner which will promise best hope of maximum agreementall round.                                                 &quot;
