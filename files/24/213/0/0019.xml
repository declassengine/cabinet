UN EMPLOY!lENT INSURANCE FINANCE.             Memorandum by the Minister  of Labour.        The present  limit  of the borrowing powers of the   Unemployment  Ptuid is  50,000,000, having been raised to that   amount  by the Act  passed last April (The Unompl03mient Insurance   Uro.2)  Act, 1930).        The average  live register since  March has been as follows             April..................,........ 1,678,382             May  ...........................ls745,248             June (2  weeks)................... l^O^S        The amount of debt  outstanding at the moment is  42,930,000,   leaving practically  7,000,000 borrowing powers still available.   Of this amount, however,  something like  1,100,000 will be   required for  payment of  interest at the end of September, leaving   availablo for financing  weekly outgoings from uhe Tund some-   thing less than  6 millions.        Under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1930, the cost of   transitional  benefit is  now borne by  the Exchequer and any   additional sum required  for this will be provided by a   supplementary estimace  oo be introduced into the House of Commons   in the  autumn.    On present figures it looks as though a   supplementary estimate for an increased grant from the Exchequer   of  8 millions or   10 millions will be required for this purpose.   This, howevor, does not  arise for the present.   The cost of   benefit payable to  persons who have paid 30 oon;ributions is a   separate matter and the borrowing powers of the Unemployment pund   which are used for this  alone - and nob for transitional benefit -   will, it is estimated, be exhausted as follows:-                                                        /Average^
Average Live Register   from now on.    Approximate:Date&quot; of exEausRfioii.1,700,0001,800,0001,900,0002 .,000,000Beginning of December, 1930.End of October, 1930.Beginning of October, 1930.End of September, 1930.     Before the House adjourns the Government  must  be certainthat there will be sufficient money available  to cover normaloutgoings and to provide for all reasonable contingenciesuntil the earliest date &quot;by which new legislation could be  passedafter Parliament reassembles in the autumn.   Having regard tothe latest live register figure, viz., 1,885,300, it is unlikelythat the existing resources of the Eund will suffice for thepurpose and there certainly can be no assurance that the Fund.would not break down during the Recess.     I have considered with the Chancellor of  the Exchequer thevarious alternatives which are available for increasing theresources of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, such as anIncrease of the contributions payable by employers, employed and the Exchequer, or any one or more of those three parties,an Exchequer grant, and an extension of the borrowing powers.We have oome definitely to the conclusion, but with greatreluc-fconoe, that the course whioh we should recommend to our colleagues is an extension of the borrowing powers.     The question of the amount of the increase of the&quot;borrowing powers has given me some concern.   It is obviouslydesirable not to ask for more than on the best estimates whichcan beformod we are likely to require to carry on for areasonable time.   On the other hand it will no doubt be agreedthat we should, if possible avoid the risk of  having to go toParliament for further money for the Unemployment Fund this financial year, apart from the supplementary- estimate already mentioned.   It will be necessary to pass before next April a/Bill
Bill dealing with transitional benefit but it would &quot;bedesirable, if possible, not to have to include a borrowing powers clause in that Bill     She following Table shows the dates on which the puiadwill on the best estimates available become exhausted with 10,000,000,  or  20,000,000 additional borrowing powers:-Average live register from now on. 10,000,000making atotal of 60,000,000. 20,000,000making atotal of 70,000,0001,700,0001,800,0001,900,0002,000,000Middle ofJune, 1931.Beginning ofApril, 1931.Beginning ofMarch, 1931.Beginning ofFebruary,1931.Beginning ofJanuary, 1932.End ofSept embor,1931,Middle ofJuly, 1931.End ofHay, 1931.     In viow of -^-ese figures I do not think we should have any3ficur-ity.that ; 3.G,000,000 would carry us over the end ofthe financial year.   Therefore I think we should take 20,000,000.     I ask for the authority of the Cabinet to introduce a Bill providing for this, and that arrangements should bemade to seoure its passage into law before the House risesfor the Summer recess.
