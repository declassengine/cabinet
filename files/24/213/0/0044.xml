A.              Report of the  Third Committee to  the Assembly.                     Rapporteur: His Excellency M. N. POLITIS (Greece).    Among the tasks assigned to the Committee on Arbitration and Security under the Assemblyresolution of September 26th, 1927, is  &quot;Action by the League of Nations with a view to promoting,generalising and co-ordinating special or collective agreements on arbitration and security &quot;.    The Committee on Arbitration and Security prepared two groups of model treaties in thisconnection, one relating to arbitration and conciliation, and the other to non-aggression and mutual assistance.    Each group of model  treaties was accompanied by an introductory note and two resolutions,one regarding the submission and recommendation of the model treaties in question, and the otherregarding the good offices  of the Council.  Moreover, the Committee on Arbitration and Securityadopted a resolution concerning the optional clause of Article 36 of the Statute of the PermanentCourt of International Justice.                                             I.    As regards the model treaties of arbitration and conciliation and the draft resolution regardingthe submission and recommendations of these models, the Third Committee  asked the FirstCommittee for a legal opinion.  In order to  facilitate liaison between the two Committees, aSub-Committee was constituted, consisting of members appointed by each of those two Committees,and this Sub-Committee considered in detail the model treaties in question.    The Committee on Arbitration and Security had prepared six model Conventions for  the pacific  Settlement  of  International Disputes,  i,e\,  three model general conventions  and threemodel bilateral conventions.    A prior question arose in regard to  the general conventions,  i.e.,  how to establish betweenthem the indispensable connection which was lacking.   Two methods were contemplated by theFirst Committee a common Protocol linking up the three Conventions, and the fusion of these con-ventions into a single instrument.  After exhaustive consideration, the Sub-Committee adopted the second method, which appeared to it to be the more practicable, and drew up a General Act(see page 10) which was approved by the First Committee. This instrument  in no  way impairsthe value of the three conventions;  rather it  increases their  value as regards the simplicity ofthe system and the  elasticity of the undertakings.   The General Act consists of four chapters,the first three  of which reproduce the distinctive provisions of the three Conventions C, B and A,while the fourth combines the general provisions of these conventions.  The General Act is opento the accession of Stat.es, and may be accepted by them in whole or in part  (Article  38).    The elasticity which the Committee on Arbitration and Security desired to give to the systemof the three Conventions is maintained, and even increased, in the General Act.  Not only does the latter give States a possibility of limiting their engagements (Article 38) and of  makingreservations (Article 39) the regulations relating to which have been revised and made moreexplicit but it also allows of the scope of the engagements already entered into being extendedat any  moment or of the reservations made  being abandoned (Article  40).  The  General Actalso  allows of partial  denunciation, which may  consist in the notification of new  reservations(Article  45).    Thus, while retaining the character  of a  law  capable  of  becoming universal,  the general act lends itself by the diversity of its provisions to an infinite variety of situationsandrequirements.    It further preserves the essential character which the Committee on Arbitration and Securityhad finally given to the three Conventions. Like these Conventions, it is not a draft which requires to be negotiated upon, or to receive signatures, in order to become an effective instrument.  It is a document which can be converted into a Convention as soon  as it is accepted in its entirety orin part  by two  States.  It will remain open  indefinitely for  the accession of all  other States.Naturally, it is assumed that Governments will first secure the parliamentary approval necessar)&apos;under their respective national constitutions, and that, in this  way, the accessions will becomevalid.    The provisions of the General Act resulting from the fusion of the three Conventions have been modified in certain  points, in view  of the observations made by various  delegations.    Among the most important  of these changes,  mention should be made of the  following:         (1)  The choice  of the members of the Arbitral Tribunal provided for  in Chapter III    in the case of disagreement among the parties (Article 23).   This change was effected for the    purpose of ensuring still  more completely the impartiality of the Tribunal;         (2)  The deletion of  the  reservation regarding constitutional  principles  (Article 39).    The reasons which led to this reservation being omitted are  that it  would  have  created    inequality as between States possessing different constitutional systems and also that what is    essential in this reservation can be safeguarded by the provisions of paragraph (c) in the same    article;         (3)   The addition to the above-mentioned paragraph (c)  in Article 39 of a reference to    disputes  concerning  &quot;specific subject-matters&quot;.   This would enable States  which  have    concluded conciliation treaties  with other States, and which do not  desire, as regards these    States, to enter into undertakings  concerning judicial or arbitral settlement, to assume    such undertakings with other States by acceding to the General Act.
    Other amendments were proposed, but were not adopted, such as:        (i)   The definition and enforcement of the term  &quot; reasonable time &quot; in Article 31,    paragraph 1.   It is, indeed, impossible to indicate what a &quot; reasonable time &quot; might be under    the different national laws of the various countries, in view of the variety of the judicial systems    and the practice of different States.  Moreover Article 41, under which all disputes regarding    the interpretation and application  of the  General Act are submitted to the Permanent Court    of International Justice, provides  the  means for dealing with any possible abuses;        (2)  The addition to Article 39 of a provision whereby, should one party accede with    reservations, any other party which has already acceded would be entitled, within a very    short period, to indicate reservations which would be valid solely in its  relations with the    above-mentioned party.  This addition would have seriously complicated the general structure    of the system; and have led in practice  to inextricable difficulties.    From another point of view the proposals of the Committee on Arbitration and  Securitycontinue unchanged. By framing three  model bilateral Conventions (see pages 16 to 27) in additionto the three model general conventions, the Committee did not intend to indicate any preference asbetween these two classes of treaty.  They were submitted simultaneously to take account of thetwo tendencies which had appeared in the course of the Committee&apos;s work, i.e., one favourable togeneral engagements and the other to particular engagements.  Their simultaneous presentationthus constituted, as between these two tendencies, a compromise which continued to be respected.Nevertheless, the framing of the General Act caused certain misgivings in this respect.  The FirstCommittee desired to remove  them by categorical statements contained in the draft resolutionaccompanying these documents.   Three  model bilateral conventions are annexed to this draft resolution, in addition to the General Act;  and it is stated in the resolution that countries whichprefer  particular agreements may  conclude such agreements either by using the model bilateralconventions or by concluding their agreements on other bases.     The draft  resolution further  includes  the substance of the preamble to  the three generalconventions and of the draft resolution relating thereto; clauses taken from the provisions of thethree general conventions regarding the action of the League of Nations (No. 7) which it seemedpreferable to separate from the actual text  of the General Act, so as to allow of this Act meetingthe case of States not Members of the League of Nations.     This paragraph was modified during the discussion  in Committee  so as to remove certainapprehensions and it was understood that the action of the Council was not intended to  interruptany procedure  which had been begun  and that it would be desirable if the details of such action were thoroughly examined at a later date. Finally, two provisions, one of which (No.  9) providedfor the communication of the General Act and of the model bilateral conventions to States Membersof the League of Nations and to such States non-Members of the. League as may be  indicated by the Council, and  the other  (No. 10)  providing for the preparation by  the Secretariat of theLeague of a list of the general or particular engagements contracted, to enable aU of them to follow the future progress of the procedure for the pacific settlement of international disputes.     The Third Committee also examined the draft resolution for the Assembly, drawn up by theCommittee on Arbitration and Security,  concerning the good offices of the Council with a view tothe conclusion of treaties on the pacific settlement of international disputes.   It adopted this draftwith a slight addition in the last paragraph  to bring it into line with the corresponding draft resolu-tion concerning the good offices of the Council with a view to the conclusion of treaties of mutual assistance and non-aggression.     The Third Committee therefore has the  honour to submit to the Assembly for approval thetwo following draft resolutions:I. RESOLUTION  ON THE SUBMISSION AND RECOMMENDATION OF A GENERAL  ACT AND OF  THREE    MODEL BILATERAL CONVENTIONS IN REGARD TO CONCILIATION,  ARBITRATION AND JUDICIAL    SETTLEMENT.        The Assembly:        Having considered the work of the Committee on Arbitration and Security;        (1)  Firmly convinced that effective machinery for  ensuring the  peaceful settlement    of international disputes is an essential element in the cause of security and  disarmament;        (2)  Considering that the  faithful  observance,  under  the  auspices of the League  of    Nations, of methods of pacific settlement renders possible the settlement of all disputes;        (3)  Noting that respect for rights established by treaty or  resulting from international    law is obligatory  upon international tribunals;        (4)  Recognising that the rights of the several States cannot be modified  except with    their  consent;        (5)  Taking note of the fact that a great number of particular international conventions    provide for obligatory conciliation, arbitration or judicial settlement;        (6)  Being desirous  of facilitating to the  greatest  possible  degree  the development of    undertakings in regard to the said methods of procedure;        (7)  Declaring that such undertakings are not to  be interpreted as  restricting  the    duty  of the League of Nations to take at any time whatever action may be deemed wise and1 SEE PAGE 10.2 SEE PAGE 16 AND 27.
effectual to safeguard the peace of the world; or as impeding its intervention in virtue ofArticles 15 and 17 of the Covenant, where a dispute cannot be submitted to arbitral or judicialprocedure or cannot be settled by such procedure or where the conciliation proceedings have failed;     (8)  Invites all States whether Members of the League or not, and in so far  as theirexisting agreements do not already achieve this end, to accept obligations in pursuance of theabove purpose either by becoming parties to the annexed General Act or by concludingparticular  conventions with individual. States in  accordance with  the  model bilateralconventions annexed hereto or in such terms as may be deemed appropriate;     (9)  Resolves  to   communicate  the  annexed  General  Act  and  the annexed  modelbilateral conventions to all Members of the League of Nations and to such States not Membersof the League as may be indicated by the Council.     (10)  Requests the Council to give the Secretariat of the League of Nations instructionsto keep a list of the engagements  contracted in accordance with the terms of the  presentresolution either by acceptance of the provisions of the General Act or by the  conclusion ofparticular conventions with the same object, so as to enable Members of the League and Statesnon-Members of the League to obtain information as soon as possible.          2.  RESOLUTION CONCERNING THE GOOD OFFICES OF THE COUNCIL.     &quot; The Assembly:     &quot; In  view  of  the resolution  adopted  by  the  Assembly  on  September  25TH,  1926,requesting the Council to offer its good  offices  to  States  Members of the League for  theconclusion of suitable agreements likely to establish confidence and  security;     &quot; Recognising  that the  development  of procedures  for the  pacific settlement of anydisputes which may arise between States  is an essential factor in the prevention of wars;     &quot; Expresses its appreciation  of the progress achieved in concluding treaties of this kind,and its desire to see the application of the principle of the  pacific settlement of all disputesextended as far as possible, and     &quot; Invites the Council, to inform all States Members of the League that, should Statesfeel the need of reinforcing the general security conferred by the Covenant and of contractingfor this purpose undertakings concerning the pacific settlement  of any disputes which may arise between them, and should negotiations in connection  therewith meet with  difficulties,the Council would,  if requested to do so by one of the  Parties  - after it has examined  thepolitical situation and taken account of the general interests of peace   be prepared to place at the disposal of the States  concerned its  good offices, which, being voluntarily accepted bythem, would be calculated to bring the negotiations to a happy issue. &quot;                                               II.    As regards the question of non-aggression and mutual assistance, the Committee on arbitration and Security has drawn up three model treaties (see pages .32 to 46), namely, a model coUectivetreaty of mutual assistance, a model collective treaty of non-aggression, and a model bilateral treatyof non-aggression. These model treaties contain, in Chapter II, stipulations concerning the peaceful settlement of disputes.   These stipulations are  broadly similar to the corresponding stipulationsin the General Act and  in the model bilateral conventions for the pacific settlement  of disputes.    The principles  of  these  model treaties concerning  non-aggression and mutual assistancewere explained in the introductory note drawn up by the Committee on Arbitration and Security.    It will be seen from this note that the model treaties do not provide for mutual assistance by the Contracting Parties in the case of aggression by a third State.  This note indicated that it hadbeen decided to insert in the said models only clauses of a general character likely to be accepted in a treaty of this kind.  Care was taken to indicate a certain number of particular clauses whichmight be found useful  in certain circumstances.  Such are,  for example, the clauses relative toflagrant aggression and to demilitarised zones.    (1)  As regards the clause concerning flagrant aggression, it has been proposed to accept as ageneral rule in treaties of mutual assistance a clause similar to Article 4, paragraph 3, of the RhinePact of Locarno.   This clause would read as follows:         &quot; In the case of a flagrant violation of Article 1 of the present Treaty by one of the High    Contracting Parties, each of the other Contracting Powers hereby undertakes immediately    to come to  the help of the  Party  against which  such  a violation has been directed,    as soon as the said Power has  been able to  satisfy itself that this violation constitutes an    unprovoked act of  aggression and that, by reason either of the crossing of the frontier or the    outbreak  of  hostilities,  immediate action  is- necessary.  Nevertheless,  the Council of the    League of Nations, when officially informed ofthequestion in accordance with the first paragraph    of this article, will issue its  findings, and the High Contracting Parties undertake to act in    accordance with the recommendations  of the Council, provided that they are concurred in by    all the members other than the representatives of the Parties which have engaged in hostilities.&quot;    Certain States attach particular importance, in the case of a flagrant aggression, to the promise of assistance before action is taken by the Council.   But it was also thought that it would be wiser
not to recommend the system adopted at Locarno and that the examination of the special circum-stances of each case will allow it to be decided whether the clause in question should be inserted ina given treaty or not.     (2)   In the same way, as regards the establishment of demilitarised zones,  it was recognisedthat, while they are often capable of giving the nations concerned a greater sense  of security, this isnot  always the  case.   Here again, all depends on circumstances.   If the contracting parties or some of them consider it useful to establish such zones on their frontiers, they may do so by meansof special conventions.     During the discussion before the Third Committee, it was suggested that it might be well forthe Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference or the Committee on Arbitration and security, to draw  up model regulations for demilitarised zones.  Such a model might no doubtgreatly facilitate negotiations between States who were  prepared to establish a zone or zones alongtheir frontiers.  In the proceedings of the Inter-Parliamentary Union we already possess interestingsuggestions in this connection, in particular, a preliminary draft of &quot; General Regulations &quot; fordemilitarised zones, voted by the Union at its conference at Washington in 1925.     The Third Committee decided to amend slightly the draft resolution prepared by the Committeeon Arbitration and Security for the submission and recommendation of the treaties of non-aggres-sion and  mutual  assistance.    To  meet  the wish  expressed  by  certain  delegations,  theThird Committee added the reference to the explanations given in the introductory note drawnup by the aforesaid Committee.     It also completed the same  Committee&apos;s draft resolution regarding the good offices of  theCouncil with a view to the conclusion of treaties of non-aggression and mutual assistance.  It  didthis  with the object of making it clearer that in such cases the Councils intervention could onlybe sought by one of the Parties concerned.     The  Third  Committee therefore has the honour to submit for the approval of the assembly the following draft resolutions:3.   RESOLUTION ON THE SUBMISSION AND RECOMMENDATION  OF MODEL  TREATIES OF  NON-                         AGGRESSION AND MUTUAL ASSISTANCE.         &quot; The  Assembly;         &quot; Having noted the model treaties of non-aggression and mutual assistance prepared by     the Committee on Arbitration and Security, and amended as  a result of  the  woric of the     First and Third Committees  of  the Assembly, together  with the  explanations  supplied   &apos; in the introductory note drawn up by the  first-named Committee;         &quot; Highly  appreciating the value  of these model treaties;         &quot; And convinced that their adoption by the States concerned would contribute towards     strengthening  the guarantees of security:         &quot; Recommends them for consideration by States Members or non-members of the League     of Nations; and         &quot; Hopes that  they  may serve as a basis for States desiring to conclude treaties of this    sort. &quot;  \             4. RESOLUTION CONCERNING THE GOOD OFFICES OF THE COUNCIL.         &quot; In view of the  resolution adopted by  the Assembly on  September 25th,  1926,    requesting  the Council  to  offer its good offices to States  Members of the League  for the    conclusion of suitable agreements likely to establish confidence and security,        &quot; The  Assembly,        &quot; Convinced that the conclusion between States in the same geographical area  of treaties    of non-aggression and mutual assistance providing for conciliation, arbitration and  mutual    guarantees against  aggression by  any one of them constitutes one of  the  most practical    means that can now be recommended to States anxious to secure more effective guarantees    of security;        &quot; Being of opinion that the good offices of the Council if freely accepted  by all the parties    concerned might facilitate the conclusion of such treaties;         &quot; Invites  the Council,  to inform all the States Members of the League of Nations that *    should States  feel the  need of reinforcing  the general security conferred by the Covenant    and of concluding a treaty of non-aggression and mutual assistance or a treaty of non-aggression    for this purpose, and should the negotiations relating thereto meet  with difficulties, the    Council would, if requested by one of the Parties   after it has examined  the  political    situation and taken account of the general interests of peace   be prepared to place at the    disposal of the States concerned its good offices which, being voluntarily accepted, would be    calculated to bring the negotiations to a happy issue.  &quot;                                           III.    The Committee on Arbitration and Security recommends that a draft resolution concerningthe optional clause of Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of  International Justicebe submitted for  the approval of the  Assembly.   This  draft  was examined by the  FirstCommittee, which  made a useful addition  to the penultimate paragraph.   The Third Committee
    5.  RESOLUTION REGARDING THE OPTIONAL  CLAUSE  OF ARTICLE 36  OF THE STATUTE                  OF THE  PERMANENT  COURT OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE.        &quot; The  Assembly:        &quot; Referring to the resolution of October  2nd, 1924, in which the Assembly, considering    that the terms of Article 36,  paragraph  2, of the Statute of the  Permanent Court  of    International Justice are sufficiently wide to permit States to adhere to the special Protocol    opened  for signature in virtue  of  that  article, with the reservations which they  regard    as indispensable, and convinced that it is in the interest of the progress of international justice    that the greatest possible number  of States should,  to  the widest possible extent,  accept    as compulsory the jurisdiction of the Court, recommends States to accede to the said Protocol    at the earliest possible date;        &quot; Noting that this recommendation has not so far produced all the effect that is to  be    desired;        &quot; Being of opinion that, in order to  facilitate effectively the acceptance of the clause    in question, it is expedient to diminish the obstacles which prevent  States from committing    themselves;        &quot; Being convinced  that the efforts  now being made through  progressive codification    to diminish the uncertainties and supply the deficiencies of international  law  will greatly    facilitate the acceptance of  the  optional clause of Article  36 of the  Statute of the  Court,    and that meanwhile attention should once  more be drawn to the  possibility offered by    the terms of that clause to  States  which do not see  their  way to accede to  it without    qualification to do so  subject  to  appropriate reservations limiting the  extent of their    commitments, both as regards duration and as regards scope;        &quot; Noting in this latter  connection that the reservations conceivable may relate, either    generally to certain aspects  of any  kind  of dispute, or specifically to  certain classes  or lists    of disputes, and that these different kinds of reservation can be  legitimately combined;        &quot; Recommends that States which have not yet acceded to the optional clause of  Article    36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice  should, failing accession    pure and simple, consider, with due  regard to their interests, whether they can accede on the    conditions  above indicated;        &quot; Requests the Council to communicate the text of this resolution to those States  as    soon as possible, desiring them to notify it  of their intentions in the matter, indicating    at the same time the questions  of international law the elucidation of which would in their    opinion facilitate their accession to the  optional clause of Article 36 of the Statute of the    Court; and        &quot; Asks the Council to inform the Assembly at its next session of the replies it has by then    received. &quot;                                            IV.    Lastly,  the First Committee examined  and approved a draft resolution submitted  by theFrench delegation  concerning the documentation  of the Secretariat of the League of Nations inregard to treaties on peaceful settlement and arbitral awards.    The Third Committee, having accepted this proposal, has the honour to submit for the approvalof the Assembly the following resolution:6.  RESOLUTION WITH REGARD TO THE REVISION OF THE SYSTEMATIC SURVEY  OF ARBITRATION    CONVENTIONS AND TREATIES OF MUTUAL SECURITY DEPOSITED WITH THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS,    PREPARED BY THE  LEGAL SECTION OF THE SECRETARIAT.        &quot; The Assembly:         &quot; Recognising the importance of the documentation which the  Secretariat of the  League    of Nations has begun to collect concerning  treaties of judicial  settlement, arbitration and    conciliation, and of the maps and graphs which it contemplates  establishing:        &quot; Requests the Secretary-General to be so good as to invite the Governments of States    Members or non-Members of the League of Nations to communicate to the Secretariat the    text:             &quot;  (1)  Of  those treaties for the pacific settlement of  disputes which are  now in        force and which were concluded prior to the establishment of the League of Nations        and which have not been registered;             &quot;  (2)  Of such arbitral awards affecting them as may be rendered in the future, with        the exception of judgments  of the Permanent Court of International Justice and of the        Permanent Court  of Arbitration and of special  tribunals such as the Mixed Arbitral        Tribunals. &quot;accepted the text thus revised.  It therefore has the honour to propose to the Assembly the adoptionof the following resolution:
B.                  Pacific  Settlement of  International Disputes. i.  RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE ASSEMBLY ON SEPTEMBER 26TH,  1928, ON THE         SUBMISSION AND RECOMMENDATION OF A GENERAL ACT AND OF THREE         MODEL  BILATERAL   CONVENTIONS   IN  REGARD   TO  CONCILIATION,         ARBITRATION AND JUDICIAL SETTLEMENT.     The Assembly:     Having considered the work of the Committee on Arbitration and Security;     (1)  Firmly  convinced  that effective machinery  for ensuring the peaceful settlement  of international disputes is an essential element in the cause of security  and disarmament;     (2)  Considering that the faithful observance, under the auspices of the League of Nations, of methods of pacific settlement renders possible the settlement of all  disputes;     (3)  Noting that respect for rights established by treaty or resulting from international law is obligatory upon international tribunals;     (4)  Recognising that the rights of the several States cannot be  modified except with their consent;     (5)  Taking note of the fact that a  great number of particular international conventions provide for obligatory conciliation, arbitration or judicial settlement;     (6)  Being desirous of facilitating to the greatest possible degree  the development of under- takings in  regard to the said methods of procedure;     (7)  Declaring that such undertakings are  not to be interpreted as restricting the duty of the League of Nations to take at any time whatever action may be  deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of the world;  or as impeding its intervention in virtue of Articles 15 and 17 of the Covenant, where a dispute cannot be submitted to arbitral or judicial procedure or cannot be settled by such procedure or where the conciliation  proceedings have failed;     (8)  Invites all States whether Members of the League or not, and in so far as their existing agreements do not already achieve this  end, to accept obligations in  pursuance of  the  above purpose either by becoming parties to  the annexed General Act  or by concluding particular conventions with  individual States in accordance with  the model bilateral conventions annexed hereto  or in such terms as may be  deemed appropriate;     (9)   Resolves  to communicate  the annexed General Act and  the  annexed model bilateralconventions to all Members of the  League of Nations  and to such States  not Members of theLeague as may be indicated by  the Council.     (10)   Requests the Council to give the Secretariat  of the League of Nations  instructions tokeep a list  of the engagements contracted in accordance with the terms  of the present resolutioneither by acceptance of the provisions of the General Act or by the  conclusion of  particular con-ventions with the same object, so as to enable Members.of the League  and States non-Membersof the League to obtain information as soon as possible.     2.

The Assembly:    In view  of the resolution adopted by the  Assembly on September 25th, 1926, requestingthe Council to offer its good offices to States Members of the League for the conclusion of suitableagreements likely to establish confidence and security;    Recognising that the  development of procedures for the pacific settlement of any disputes which may arise between States is an essential factor in the prevention of wars;    Expresses its appreciation of the progress achieved in concluding treaties of this kind, andits desire to see the application of the principle of the pacific settlement of all disputes extendedas far as possible,  and    Invites the Council to inform all States Members of the League that, should States feel theneed of reinforcing the general security  conferred by the Covenant and of contracting for thispurpose undertakings concerning the pacific settlement of any disputes which may arise betweenthem, and should negotiations in connection therewith meet with difficulties, the Council would,if requested to do  so by one of the Parties   after it has examined the political situation and taken account of the general interests of peace    be prepared to place at the disposal of theStates concerned its good offices, which, being voluntarily accepted by them, would be calculated to bring the negotiations to  a happy issue.
3.   INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO THE GENERAL ACT AND THE MODEL BILATERAL         CONVENTIONS a, b, c, FOR THE PACIFIC SETTLEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL         DISPUTES.    During its ninth ordinary session, at the meeting held on September 26th, 1928, the Assemblyadopted a General Act for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, open to the accession of States, and which will enter into force  ninety days after two States have acceded thereto. it also adopted three model bilateral conventions (a, b, c) which States may adopt or which mayserve  as a basis if they desire to conclude particular conventions with one another for the pac ficsettlement of international disputes.    The  General  Act and the three bilateral conventions are in substance the same.  The  general act combines the principal provisions of the three conventions, but with  certain differences dueto the character of the General Act and the particular nature of the bilateral conventions.    It should be noted that the provisions with regard  to the pacific settlement of international disputes contained in the treaties of non-aggression and mutual assistance (D) and of non-aggression(E and F)  have generally been taken  from model convention b.   N. B.   This introductory note has been drafted by the Secretariat in conformity with the instructions of the Councilof the League of Nations, dated September 26th, 1928.                I.  GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE GENERAL ACT AND THE THREE                               MODEL BILATERAL CONVENTIONS.     The Assembly followed a certain number of guiding principles:     1.  It was careful to take into consideration the special situation of the different  States with regard to the various methods for the pacific settlement of disputes and it therefore endeavoured to make the system of procedure submitted for  the approval of States as elastic as possible.          (a)  In the first place, the States have  a choice between the General Act open to  all the     bilateral conventions (a,  b, c);          (&amp;)  In the second place, the engagements may vary in their extent.  Whether  States     accede to the General Act or to the bilateral conventions,  they have a choice between three     kinds of obligations:              The  first involving the submission of  disputes  of every kind to a procedure of          conciliation only (General  Act,  Chapter I;  convention c);              The  second involving the submission to judicial settlement of disputes of a legal          nature only (General Act,  Chapter II; convention b);              The  third involving the  submission of other than  legal disputes to an arbitral          tribunal  (General Act, Chapter  III; convention a);          (c)  Finally, generous provision is made for  reservations.  Article 39 of the General Act     allows any dispute to  be excluded from the obligation to resort to judicial settlement or     arbitration or even  to  conciliation.  Although it is important that as many accessions as     possible  should be made  without any reservations, the Assembly was anxious above all to     evolve a practical scheme and  to  take  into account the  special  difficulties by which each     State might  be confronted.     2.  Although the Assembly was anxious to respect the liberty of States and to exercise no pressure, even of a moral kind, with a view to persuading Governments to undertake engagements to which they might not feel free to subscribe, it desired that these engagements, whatever their scope, should possess a certain  value.     (a)  For this reason, the failure of the parties to conclude a special agreement or to  set up a conciliation commission or an arbitral tribunal does not prevent the  procedure of pacific settle- ment from following its course.  In these circumstances, the  special  agreement would be dispensed with  and commissioners or arbitrators  would be appointed by the proper procedure.     (b)  In the same way, reservations  are made subject to rules and&apos; regulations.   Vague or&apos; indefinite reservations are not allowed.  Only disputes concerning particular cases or cases  falling within specified categories may be excluded from the procedure laid down; thus the reservation of vital interests is eliminated. If a State wishes to exclude certain disputes or categories of disputes which it considers affect  its vital interests, it must define these disputes or categories of disputes.     (c)   Finally, it is laid down in the General Act that disputes as to its interpretation or applica- tion,  including those concerning the classification of disputes jand  the  scope  of  reservations,
shall be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice.  This provision is also includedin the three bilateral  conventions.  Its object is to prevent disputes  concerning  interpretationfrom allowing any of  the parties to hold up the procedure.    3.   The Assembly has made as few innovations as possible. The General Act and the bilateralconventions are to a very great extent based on the very large number of particular conventionson judicial settlement, arbitration and conciliation already in force between States.   Thus theclassical distinction between disputes  of a legal nature and those  of a non-legal nature forms abasic principle of the  General  Act and the  bilateral conventions a and b.    The  formula? most  frequently met with in existing  conventions for the pacific  settlementof disputes have been retained whenever it did not seem to be in the general  interest to omitor change them.    Similarly, the conventions have been drafted in such a manner that they in  no  way affectother conventions of any kind which States may have concluded or may conclude  for the pacificsettlement of disputes. The new conventions will only be applied subsidiarily and will only settledisputes which do not come within the scope of other conventions.II.  GENERAL FEATURES OF THE VARIOUS PROCEDURES.    There are three procedures: conciliation, judicial settlement, and arbitration.    1.   Conciliation.  Conciliation is laid down in general for all disputes.  But where disputesof a legal nature are submitted to judicial settlement, conciliation is only an optional preliminary.For other disputes,  it is obligatory.    The conciliation commission is permanent or special.  In both cases its composition is thesame: there are five  members.  The parties separately appoint one each. The three other members are appointed by agreement between the parties.  If it is not possible  to reach agreement, one ortwo third Powers are called in, and, if necessary,  lots are drawn.    The conciliation commission  must terminate its work within six months.    2.   Judicial Settlement.  Judicial settlement, for  which arbitration may be substituted, is laid down for disputes of a legal nature.  The competent authority for judicial settlement is thePermanent Court of  International Justice. If, however, the parties so wish, they may have recourse to an arbitral tribunal, but in this case, if they are unable  to agree upon the terms of the special agreement or upon the appointment of arbitrators, the matter may, at the request of one of theparties, again be  brought before the Permanent  Court of International Justice.    3.  Arbitration. Arbitration is reserved for disputes other than those of a legal nature.    The arbitral  tribunal is composed of five members, two of which are appointed separatelyby the parties and three by agreement between them.  If agreement cannot be reached, one ortwo third Powers may be called in,  as in the case of the conciliation commission. If, however,there is still no agreement, instead of drawing lots, a decision is given by the President, the Vice-President or some other member of the Permanent Court  of International Justice.  In the caseof arbitration, this  procedure  seems  preferable to the drawing of lots, which might result in theappointment of all the candidates preferred by one party.    The powers of  the arbitral tribunal judging disputes other than  those of a legal nature, are clearly defined (General Act, Article 28; Convention a, Article 31).  The arbitrator cannot, underthe plea of equity,  override established law  (custom  and treaties).  Only in the absence of anyestablished law will the  arbitrator give a decision in accordance with equity.III.  PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE GENERAL ACT ONLY.    Unlike the model bilateral conventions, which are simply intended to furnish guidance anda basis for Governments wishing to conclude particular conventions, the General Act is a  final text in fixed terms which will come into force as soon as it has received at least two accessions.    Amongst other provisions, it contains those concerning the  possibility of total or partialaccession (Article 38), partial denunciation (Article 45), reservations (Article 39) and organisationof conciliation and arbitration procedure, when more than two States parties to the convention are involved (Article 34).    The duration of the General Act is five years from its coming into force.  The period will bethe same for all acceding States whatever the date of their accession.  This introduces an element of simplicity and clearness.  Unless denunciation is made at the end of the period, States will be bound by tacit renewal for  a  further period of five years.

In the absence of sufficient particulars in the special agreement, the provisions of the Hague Convention of October  18th, 1907, for  the Pacific Settlement of International  Disputes  shall apply so far  as is necessary. If nothing is laid down in the special agreement as to the rules regarding the substance  of the dispute to be  followed by. the arbitrators,  the  tribunal shall apply the substantive  rules enumerated in Article 38 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice.                                          Article 19.      If the parties fail to  agree concerning the special  agreement referred to in the preceding article,  or fail to appoint arbitrators, either party  shall be at liberty, after giving three months&apos; notice, to  bring the dispute by an application direct before the Permanent Court  of International Justice.

They must be of different nationalities and must not be habitually resident in the territory nor be in the service of the parties.                                         Article 23.     1.  If the appointment of the members of the Arbitral Tribunal is not made  within a period of three months from the date on which one of the parties requested the other party to constitute an arbitral tribunal, a third  Power, chosen by agreement between the parties, shall be requested to  make the  necessary appointments.     2.  If no agreement is reached on this point, each party shall designate a different Power, and the appointments  shall  be made in  concert by the  Powers thus  chosen.    3.  If, within a period of three months, the two Powers so chosen have been unable to reach an agreement, the necessary appointments shall be made by the President of the Permanent  Court of International Justice.  If the latter is prevented from acting or is a subject of one of the parties, the nomination shall be made by  the Vice-President.   If the latter is prevented from  acting or is a subject of one of the parties, the appointments shall be made by the oldest member of the Court who is not a subject of either  party.

                                         Article  27.     Failing the conclusion of a special agreement within a period of three months from the date on which the Tribunal was constituted, the dispute may be brought before the Tribunal by an application by one or other party.                                         Article  28.     If nothing is laid down in the special agreement or no special agreement has been made, the Tribunal shall apply the rules in regard to the substance of the dispute enumerated in Article 38 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice.  In so far as there exists no such rule applicable to the dispute,  the Tribunal  shall decide ex aequo et bono.                            CHAPTER IV.   GENERAL PROVISIONS.                                         Article  29.     1.   Disputes for the settlement of which a special procedure is laid down in other conventions in force  between the parties to the dispute shall be settled in conformity with the provisions of those conventions.     2.   The present  General Act shall not affect any agreements in force by which conciliation procedure is established between the Parties or they are bound by obligations to resort to arbitration or judicial settlement which ensure the settlement of the dispute.   If, however, these  agree- ments provide only for a procedure of  conciliation, after such procedure has been followed without  result,  the provisions  of  the present General  Act concerning judicial settlement or arbitration shall be applied in  so far as the parties have acceded thereto.                                         Article 30.     If a party brings before a  Conciliation Commission a dispute which the other party,  relying on conventions in force between the parties, has submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice or an  Arbitral Tribunal, the Commission shall defer consideration of the dispute until the Court or the Arbitral Tribunal  has pronounced upon the conflict of competence. The same rule shall apply if the Court or the Tribunal is seized of the  case by one of the parties during the conciliation proceedings.                                         Article 31.     1.

In such a case, the party which desires to resort to the procedures laid down in the present General Act must notify the other party of its intention within a period of one year from the date of the  aforementioned decision.                                         Article 32.     If, in a judicial sentence or arbitral award, it is declared that a judgment, or a measure enjoined by a court of law or other  authority of one of the parties to the dispute, is wholly or in part contrary to international law, and if the constitutional law of that party does not permit or only partially permits the consequences of the judgment or measure in question to be annulled,  the parties agree that the judicial sentence or arbitral  award shall grant the injured party equitable satisfaction.                                         Article 33.     1.   In all cases where a dispute forms the object of arbitration or judicial proceedings, and particularly if the question on which the parties differ arises out of acts already committed or on the point of being committed, the Permanent Court of International Justice, acting in accordancewith Article 41 of its Statute, or the Arbitral Tribunal, shall lay down within the shortest possible time the  provisional measures to be adopted.  The parties to the dispute shall be bound to accept such measures.    2.   If the dispute is brought before  a Conciliation  Commission, the latter maj&apos; recommend to the  parties the adoption of such provisional measures  as it considers suitable.    3.   The parties undertake to abstain from all measures likely to react prejudicially upon the execution of the judicial or arbitral decision or upon the arrangements proposed by the ConciliationCommission and, in general, to abstain from any sort of action whatsoever which may aggravateor extend the dispute.

    In the former case, the parties shall each appoint one commissioner and shall jointly appointcommissioners nationals of third Powers not parties to the dispute, whose number shall alwaysexceed by one the number of commissioners appointed separately by the parties.    In the second case, the parties who act together shall appoint their commissioner jointly byagreement  between themselves and shall combine with the other party or parties in appointingthird commissioners.    In either event, the parties, unless they agree otherwise, shall apply Article 5 and the followingarticles of the present Act, so far as they are compatible with the provisions of the present article.    (b)  In the case of judicial procedure, the Statute of the Permanent Court of InternationalJustice shall apply.    (c)   In the case of arbitral procedure, if agreement is not secured as to the composition of thetribunal, in the  case of the disputes mentioned in Article 17 each party shall have the right, bymeans of an application, to submit the  dispute to the Permanent Court of International Justice;in the case  of the disputes mentioned in Article 21, the above Article 22 and following articles shallapply, but  each party having separate  interests  shall appoint one  arbitrator and the number ofarbitrators separately appointed by the parties to the dispute shall always be one less than thatof the other arbitrators.                                         Article 35.    1.  The present General Act shall be applicable as between the Parties thereto, even though a third Power, whether a party to the Act or not,  has an interest in the dispute.    2.  In conciliation procedure, the parties may agree to invite such third Power to intervene.                                         Article 36.    1.  In judicial  or arbitral procedure, if a third Power should consider that it has an interestof a legal nature which may be affected by the decision in the case, it may submit to the PermanentCourt of International Justice or to the arbitral tribunal a request to intervene as a third Party.    2.  It  will be for the Court or the tribunal to decide upon this request.                                         Article 37.    1.  Whenever the  construction of a convention to which States other than those concernedin the case  are parties is in question, the Registrar of the Permanent Court of International Justiceor the arbitral tribunal shall notify all such States forthwith.    2.  Every State so notified has the right to intervene in the proceedings;but, if it uses this right, the construction given by the decision will be binding upon it.                                         Article 38.    Accessions to the present General Act may extend:         A.  Either to all the provisions of the Act (Chapters I, II, III andTV);         B.

Or to those provisions only which relate to conciliation (Chapter I), together with the    general provisions concerning that  procedure (Chapter IV).    The Contracting Parties may benefit by the  accessions of other Parties only in so far as theyhave themselves assumed the same obligations.                                         Article 39.    1.   In addition to the power given  in the preceding article, a Party, in acceding to the present general Act, may make his acceptance conditional upon the reservations exhaustively enumerated in the following paragraph.  These reservations must be indicated at the time of accession.    2.   These reservations may be such as to exclude from the procedure described in the present act:         (a)   Disputes arising out of facts prior to the accession either of the Party making the    reservation or  of any other Party with whom the said Party may have a dispute;         (b)   Disputes concerning questions which by international law are solely within the    domestic jurisdiction of States;         (c)   Disputes concerning particular cases or clearly specified  subject-matters, such as    territorial status, or disputes falling within clearly defined. categories.    3.   If one of the parties to a dispute has made a reservation, the other parties may enforce thesame reservation in regard to that party.     4.   In the case of Parties who have acceded to the provisions of the present  General Actrelating to judicial settlement or to arbitration, such reservations as they may have made shall,unless otherwise expressly stated, be deemed not to apply to the procedure of conciliation.

Non-Aggression and Mutual Assistance.i.  RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE ASSEMBLY ON SEPTEMBER 26TH, 1928, ON THE        SUBMISSION AND  RECOMMENDATION  OF MODEL  TREATIES  OF NON-        AGGRESSION AND MUTUAL ASSISTANCE.    The Assembly:    Having noted the model treaties of non-aggression and mutual assistance prepared by theCommittee on Arbitration and  Security, and amended as a result of the work of the First and third Committees of the  Assembly, together with the explanations supplied in the introductorynote drawn up by the first-named Committee;    Highly appreciating the value of these model treaties;    And convinced that their  adoption  by the States  concerned would contribute  towardsstrengthening the guarantees of security:    Recommends them for consideration by States Members  or non-Members  of the Leagueof Nations; and    Hopes that they may serve as a basis for States desiring to conclude treaties of this sort.     2. RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE ASSEMBLY ON SEPTEMBER 26TH, 1928,               CONCERNING THE GOOD OFFICES OF THE COUNCIL.    In view of the resolution  adopted by the Assembly on September 25th, 1926, requestingthe Council to offer its good offices to States Members of the League for the conclusion of suitableagreements likely to establish  confidence  and security,    The Assembly,    Convinced that the conclusion  between States in the same geographical area of treaties ofnon-aggression and mutual assistance providing for conciliation, arbitration and mutual guaranteesagainst aggression by any one of them constitutes one of the most practical means that can nowbe recommended to States  anxious to secure  more effective guarantees of security;    Being of opinion that the  good offices of the Council if freely accepted by all the parties concerned might facilitate the  conclusion  of such treaties;    Invites the Council, to inform all the  States Members of the League of Nations that shouldStates feel the need of reinforcing the general security conferred by the Covenant and of concludinga treaty of non-aggression and  mutual assistance or a treaty of non-aggression for this purpose,and should the negotiations relating thereto meet with difficulties, the Council would, if requested by one of the Parties,   after  it has examined the political situation and taken account of thegeneral interests of peace   be  prepared to place at the disposal of the States concerned its good offices which, being voluntarily accepted, would be  calculated  to bring the  negotiations to ahappy issue.3.   INTRODUCTORY NOTE  TO  THE  MODEL COLLECTIVE TREATY  OF  MUTUAL [        ASSISTANCE AND  COLLECTIVE  AND  BILATERAL  TREATIES  OF NON-        AGGRESSION  DRAWN   UP  BY  THE   COMMITTEE   ON   ARBITRATION j        AND SECURITY.    The Committee thought it advisable to prepare three model treaties which are of unequal jscope as regards the degree of security they might afford to States seeking fresh guarantees.                       I.  MODEL TREATY OF  MUTUAL ASSISTANCE.    The draft having the widest scope is clearly that which combines the three elements: non-aggression,  peaceful settlement of  disputes and mutual assistance.
    This draft differs from the Rhine Pact of Locarno in several respects:        (a)  It contains no clause  guaranteeing  the maintenance of the territorial status quo.        \b)  It provides for no guarantee by third States.        (c)  It provides for the case  of States non-members of the League of Nations being    parties to  the treaty.        (d)  It contains, with regard to the peaceful settlement of  disputes, a certain number    of clauses which, in the Locarno Agreements, do not figure in the  Rhine Pact, but in annexed    Conventions.    These differences are due, in the model treaty recommended,  to the following reasons:    (a)  The individual and collective  guarantee of the maintenance  of the  territorial  status quo would clearly constitute a very  important factor of security in the model  treaty proposed ;but the fact that certain Powers, when negotiating such a treaty, would not feel able to accept such a clause should not, in the Committee&apos;s opinion, prevent the negotiations from being successful.For the clause in question is not essential, and it  is understood that, being concluded under the auspices of the League of Nations and within the scope of its Covenant, the treaty assumes thefull maintenance of the fundamental principle of Article. 10 and all other provisions of the Covenantin relation between  the  contracting parties.    It is therefore quite possible to be content with the three  essential factors of the treaty:non-aggression,  the  peaceful settlement of  disputes and mutual  assistance.   By  their closecombination, they  signify that the contracting parties,  renouncing the use  of force to backup their claims, will be guided by a respect for legality in their relations with each other, and thatwhichever of them breaks its engagements will expose itself, apart from the possible applicationof the collective sanctions provided for in Article 16 of the Covenant, to the particular sanctionsorganised by the system  of mutual assistance provided for in the treaty.    (6)  Similarly, while the guarantee of third States  can greatly add  to the effectiveness of atreaty of mutual assistance, clearly its absence must not constitute an obstacle to the conclusionof the treaty.   The Committee has therefore not thought it advisable to include a clause of this nature in the model treaty it recommends.   In the event of  the contracting parties being ableto rely on the guarantee of third States, the details of  this guarantee might either figure in thetreaty itself, according to the precedent of the Rhine Pact of Locarno,  or be dealt with in separateconventions.    (c)  The Committee thought it expedient to provide for the case of States non-membersof the League of Nations being parties to the treaty.  It considers that it has made this possible by inserting the provision of Article 28  under which any non-legal conflict  between the parties would, in the event of  the failure  of conciliation proceedings, be governed by the  provisionsof Article  17 of the Covenant if one  of the parties to the dispute is not a member of the Leagueof Nations.    The Turkish delegation proposed that the Committee should go  a step further and omit the exceptions  provided  for in Article 1, which lays down the obligation of non-aggression, andshould stipulate:        (1)  That  aggression  by one  of the Contracting Parties against  another Contracting    Party would involve the annulment of  the treaty.        (2)  That aggression by one of the Contracting Parties against a third Power would involve    release from the obligation of neutrality which should be provided for in a new article of the    treaty.    Moreover,  the  Turkish delegation proposed that it should be stipulated in  Article 3 withreference to a violation of Article 1  that, if one of the  Contracting Parties not a member of theLeague of Nations so requests, the question should not be brought before the Council, but submittedto an international commission of enquiry.    The Committee was  of opinion that the problems raised by the Turkish delegation^ proposals were too complex for it to be possible to examine them at the present session. Unless the Assemblyitself desires to examine them, they might be considered at a subsequent meeting of the Committeeon Arbitration and Security.    The Turkish delegation agreed to the proposed adjournment.    [d)   The  Committee thought it advisable to insert in the  model  treaty it  recommends acertain  number of clauses relating to the peaceful settlement of disputes.   This  does not mean that the parties will not be free to apply among themselves the clauses of wider scope whichmay  have been stipulated in the arbitration conventions they have  previously concluded or which they may subsequently conclude; but the Committee desired to indicate that a certain minimum of explicit rules is necessary owing to the interdependence  of the elements of non-aggression, of the peaceful settlement of disputes and of mutual assistance.  Since it is assumingobligations  in  regard  to mutual assistance,  each of the Contracting  Parties  must know thatthe  other Parties- are  accepting sufficiently extensive obligations in regard to the peaceful settlement of disputes.    The draft treaty recommended consists of a preamble and a series of articles. In the Committee&apos;view, these texts are not unalterable.   The Contracting Parties may make any modification theyconsider useful, provided they respect the interdependence and equilibrium of the three essentialfactors  to which we have  referred.     The Committee itself indicates below a certain  number of possible departures from the textwhich it has  drawn up.
    Preamble:  The preamble might be limited to a single paragraph, omitting those whichhave been borrowed from some of the Locarno Conventions. The Committee thinks, however,that it would be well to retain these additional paragraphs.  They would serve to create that con-fidence between the Contracting Parties by which their relations should be governed. They wouldmark  the respect for legality by  which the contracting parties would agree to  be guided  intheir relations, and the absence of all chicanery and moral or political pressure.    Article  i.  The formula by which  &quot;each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes notto . . . resort to war against another Contracting Party &quot; must, in  the opinion of the Committee,be understood to mean that the  parties, which undertake by the Treaty  of Mutual Assistanceto settle all their disputes by forms of pacific procedure, in every  case exclude recourse to forcein any form whatever, apart from the exceptions formally reserved in the text.    Article  3.  It might  be possible and desirable in certain cases to add  stipulations regardingflagrant aggression.  Parties could insert in their Treaty of Mutual Assistance a  clause similar tothat in paragraph 3, Article 4, of the Rhine Pact of Locarno. This  clause reads as follows:         &quot; In  case of a flagrant violation of Article 2 of the present Treaty or  of a flagrant breach    of Articles 42 or 43 of the Treaty of Versailles by one of the High Contracting Parties,  each    of the other Contracting Parties hereby undertakes immediately to come to the help of the    Party against whom such a violation or breach has  been directed as soon as the said Power    has been able to satisfy itself  that this violation constitutes an unprovoked act of aggression    and  that, by reason  either of the crossing of the frontier or. of the outbreak of hostilities    or of the  assembly of armed forces in the  demilitarised zone, immediate  action is necessary.    Nevertheless,  the Council of  the  League of Nations, which will be seized  of the question    in accordance with the first paragraph of this Article, will issue its findings,  and the High    Contracting Parties undertake to act in accordance with the recommendations of the Council,    provided that they are concurred in by all the members other than the representatives of the    Parties  which  have engaged  in hostilities. &quot;    The Parties might further stipulate that, should the Council prescribe an armistice,  theyundertake to carry out its conditions. Such a  formula would have the twofold advantage of notanticipating any measures that the Council might take in the case of  hostilities which had started,and of facilitating the designation of the aggressor, if the Council decided to prescribe an armistice.But this is a difficult point, and the Committee thought it best to  make no mention of it in the model  treaty.                      Subjects which might be dealt with in Special Clauses.    (a)  Reservations.   The  Committee did  not think  that it  should draft  a  special articleproviding for  the possibility of excluding certain classes of disputes from the procedure  for the pacific settlement  of  disputes.   If the contracting  parties  agreed to insert  in their treatycertain reservations, they might be guided  by the provisions regarding reservations containedin Article 39 of the General Act for the Pacific Settlement of International  Disputes.  It wouldbe clearly understood,  of course, that  the undertaking regarding  non-aggression contained inArticle 1 would in no case be affected by the insertion of provisions of this kind.  Even in respectof disputes  reserved in this way, the obligation not to resort to force would remain unaffected.    (b)  Preventive and -provisional measures.    The clause inserted in the general provisionswith regard to the provisional measures which might be indicated by an  international court,or recommended by a Conciliation Commission, could be supplemented by the relevant provisionsof the model treaty to strengthen the means of preventing war (A.20.1928.IX).    (c)   Re-establishment of peace after an aggression.   The Committee had to consider, in pursuanceof the  proposal made by  some of  its members, whether the model Treaty  of Mutual assistance should not include stipulations concerning the action to be taken by the Council in connection withthe cessation of mutual assistance, the re-establishment of normal relations and the reparationsto be claimed from  the aggressor.    After consideration, the Committee decided that it would not be expedient  to insert  suchdetailed provisions.  It would always be open to the Parties, should they so desire, to extend their particular treaty by the inclusion  of clauses of this kind.    (d)  Establishment of demilitarised zones.   The establishment  of demilitarised zones,  as long experience has shown in particular  the naval demilitarisation of  the Great Lakes  of north america or  the demilitarisation of the frontier between Norway and Sweden tends to give nationsa feeling of  greater security.   However,  this is not always the case.  Here, again,  all depends  oncircumstances.  If  the Contracting Parties  or certain of them  wished to establish such zonesalong their  frontiers, they could do so by separate conventions.    (e)  Accession of third States.   The Committee decided not to insert  a clause stipulatingthat collective treaties of mutual assistance should remain open for the accession of third States.Such accessions are only conceivable with the consent of  the Contracting Parties.
    (f)   Co-ordination of Treaties of Mutual Assistance with the Covenant of the League of nations and any separate agreements which the Contracting Parties may have concluded previously.   TheCommittee considers that the provisions of the draft harmonise with those of the League Covenant.The parties will have to see that no clauses are introduced the application of which would conflict with the operation of the Covenant.  Otherwise they will risk weakening the general guaranteegiven to Members of the League by Article 16 of the Covenant.    In any case, the parties will do well to retain in their treaty the clause by which they reserve their rights and obligations as Members of the League of Nations.    The parties will also have to co-ordinate with the Treaty of Mutual Assistance any separateagreements which they may have concluded previously.    (g)   Duration of Treaties of Mutual Assistance.   The Committee did not feel called upon todecide between the various systems which could be adopted with regard to the duration of thetreaty.  It had in mind three main systems: the first,  on the lines of the Rhine  Pact of Locarno,without indication as to duration, but expiring as a result of a decision by the Council; the second,providing for a duration of ten or twenty years with the possibility of denunciation at the end ofthese periods after one year&apos;s notice, or, failing denunciation, renewal of the treaty by tacit consentfor a similar period; the third system would be a combination of the other two; it would provide fora short trial period after which the parties could free themselves from their contract subject to oneyear&apos;s notice.  If not denounced, the treaty would remain in force indefinitely, but it might bebrought to an end by a decision of the Council.    The Committee has felt that none of these systems could be definitely selected without goingvery deeply into the question a course which it has been impossible to follow.    (h)   Aggression by a third State.   The Committee has not felt called upon to refer to the mutual assistance to be afforded by Contracting Parties in the case of aggression by third States.The discussion showed that some States held that such a guarantee is necessary in view of certaindefinite contingencies, particularly where  certain other States  refuse to conclude with them a collective treaty, including non-aggression, the pacific settlement of disputes and mutual assistance.On the other hand, it may be held that it  is not for the League of Nations, whose  object it is topromote sincere co-operation between all its Members with a view to maintaining and consolidatingpeace, to recommend in a treaty of its own framing provisions which might lead to the formationof rival groups of nations.  In this connection, it has been pointed out in the course of discussion that  treaties of mutual assistance will be the more valuable and will more certainly merit thesupport of the League of Nations if they are, in accordance with the precedent of the Rhine Pact of locarno, concluded between States which only a short time ago belonged  to rival groups, or Stateswhose differences might endanger the peace of the world.    It is equally clear that the Contracting Parties  could not in any case afford any assistanceto a third State which ventured to attack one of them in violation of the Covenant of the League ofNations.  The insertion of a special clause to this effect is  useless, since it cannot be presumed that a Power which agrees to become party to a treaty of security would be.disloyal to any of itsco-signatories.  It would even be dangerous to insert such a clause, for it might weU weaken theforce  of Articles 16 and 17 of the Covenant; the undertaking not to afford assistance to a thirdaggressor State would not, for States Members of the League of Nations, be an adequate commitment.The Covenant provides, not for negative, but for positive action against any State resorting to warin violation of the engagements subscribed to in Articles 12,  13 and 15.    (i)   Linking-up of Treaties of Mutual  Assistance with disarmament.   As pointed out above in the paragraph which deals with the duration of treaties  of mutual assistance, the  latter are calculated to facilitate the successful issue of a general Conference on the Reduction and Limitationof Armaments.  The Committee on Security, not unmindful of the fact that it  owes its origin to a1927 Assembly resolution on the question of disarmament,  feels  bound to lay  special stress onthis consideration, which has influenced all its deliberations.   But it would be premature, at thepresent juncture, to attempt to define the connection which should exist between treaties of mutual assistance and the limitation and reduction of armaments.    (j)   Recommendation with a view to the conclusion of collective Treaties of Mutual Assistance.  Conceived as they are in the spirit of the League and therefore meriting the League&apos;s full support,the conclusion of collective Treaties of Mutual Assistance should, in the opinion of the Committee,be facilitated if necessary.  The Committee therefore proposes to recommend a draft resolutiondefining the conditions under which the Council of the League might, in this connection, lend itsgood offices.   In these cases, the CounciTs task would obviously be a very  delicate one, but we maybe sure that it would, as ever, act with the greatest prudence and that, if it took action in such amatter, it would be likely to prove successful.    The conclusion of a collective Treaty of Mutual Assistance, as conceived by the  Committee,naturally presupposes political preparation and endeavours to bring about a better understanding between the countries destined to conclude reciprocal agreements.        II.   MODELS OF COLLECTIVE AND BILATERAL TREATIES OF NON-AGGRESSION.    States  anxious to  obtain better  guarantees of security but  unwilling  for  some  reason or another to bind themselves by a treaty of mutual assistance will find various model treatiesunder which they can enter into obligations with other States as regards non-aggression and the pacific settlement of disputes only.   The provisions of these treaties on these two latter pointsare the same as those embodied in the draft collective treaty of mutual assistance.
4.  MODEL COLLECTIVE TREATY OF MUTUAL ASSISTANCE AND COLLECTIVE AND                      BILATERAL TREATIES OF NON-AGGRESSION.(a)  COLLECTIVE TREATY OF MUTUAL ASSISTANCE.       (Treaty D.)(List of Heads of States.)    Noting that respect for rights established by treaty or  resulting from international law isobligatory  upon international tribunals;    Recognising that the  rights of the several  States  cannot be modified except  with their consent;    Considering that the faithful observance, under the auspices of the League of Nations,  of methods  of pacific settlement renders possible the settlement of all disputes;    Desirous of establishing on a firm basis relations of frank co-operation between their respective countries and of securing additional guarantees for peace within the framework of the covenant of the League of Nations:    Have resolved to conclude a Treaty for these purposes  and have appointed as their pleni-potentiaries:who, having exchanged their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed on the following provisions:                CHAPTER  I.   NON-AGGRESSION AND MUTUAL  ASSISTANCE.                                         Article i.    Each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes, in regard to each of the  other Parties,not to attack or invade the territory of another Contracting Party, and in no case to resort towar against another Contracting Party.    This stipulation shall not, however, apply in the case of:         (i)  The exercise  of the right of legitimate defence   that is to say, resistance to a    violation of the undertaking contained in the first paragraph;         (2)  Action in pursuance of Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations;         (3)  Action as the result of a decision taken by the Assembly  or by the  Council of the    League of Nations or in pursuance of Article 15, paragraph 7, of the Covenant of the League    of Nations, provided that in this last  event the action is directed against a State which was    the first to attack.                                         Article 2.    Each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes, in regard to each of the others, to submit to a procedure of pacific settlement, in the manner provided for in the present Treaty, all questionswhatsoever on which they may differ and which it has not been possible to settle by the normalmethods of  diplomacy.                                         Article 3.    Should any one of the High Contracting Parties consider that a violation of Article 1 of thepresent Treaty has taken place or is taking place,  it shall immediately bring the question beforethe Council of the League  of Nations.    As soon as the Council of the League of Nations has ascertained that  such a violation hastaken place, it shall at once advise the Powers which have signed the present Treaty, and eachof these Powers undertakes in such a case to give assistance forthwith to the Power against whichthe act complained of has been directed.                                         Article 4.    1.  Should one of the High Contracting Parties refuse to accept the methods of pacific settle-ment  provided for in the present Treaty or to execute an arbitral award or judicial decision andbe guilty of a violation of Article 1 of the  present Treaty, the provisions of Article 3 shall apply.    2.  Should one of the High Contracting Parties, without being guilty of a violation of Article 1of the present Treaty, refuse to accept the methods of pacific settlement or to execute  an arbitralaward or judicial decision, the other party shall inform the Council of the League of Nations,which shall propose the methods to be adopted; the High Contracting Parties shall accept theseproposals.
                      CHAPTER II.   PACIFIC SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES.                                          Article 5.    1.  The following provisions shall apply to the settlement of disputes between the parties,subject to any wider undertakings which may result from other agreements between  them.    2.  The said provisions do not apply  to disputes arising out of facts prior to the presentTreaty and belonging to the past.                                        Article  6.    1.  Disputes for the settlement of which a special procedure is laid down in other conventionsin force between the parties to the dispute shall be settled in conformity with the provisions ofthose conventions.    2.  Nevertheless,  if these conventions  only  provide  for  a procedure of conciliation,  after this procedure has been employed without result,  the provisions of the present Treaty concerningjudicial or arbitral settlement shall be applied in so far as  the disputes are  of a legal nature.                        Section  I.   Judicial or  Arbitral Settlement.                                          Article 7.    All disputes with regard to which the parties  are in conflict as to their respective rights shallbe submitted  for decision to the Permanent Court of International  Justice, unless the parties agree, in the manner hereinafter  provided,  to have resort  to an arbitral tribunal.    It is understood that the disputes referred to above  include in particular those  mentionedin Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of  International Justice.                                          Article 8.    If the parties agree to submit the disputes mentioned in the preceding article to an arbitral tribunal, they shall draw up a special agreement in which they shall specify the subject of thedispute, the arbitrators  selected  and the procedure to  be  followed.  In the absence of sufficientparticulars in- the special agreement, the provisions of the Hague Convention of October  18TH,1907, for the Pacific Settlement of International  Disputes shall apply so far as is necessary.  if nothing is laid down in the special agreement as to the rules regarding the substance of the dispute to be followed  by the arbitrators, the Tribunal shall apply the substantive rules  enumerated inArticle 38 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice.                                          Article 9.    If the parties  fail  to agree concerning the special agreement referred to in the preceding article or fail to appoint arbitrators, either party shall be at liberty, after giving three months&apos;notice, to bring the dispute by an  application direct before the  Permanent  Court  of  Inter-national Justice.                                         Article 10.    If, in a judicial sentence or arbitral award, it is declared that a judgment, or a measure enjoinedby a court of law or other authority of one of the parties to the dispute, is wholly or in part contraryto international law, and if the constitutional law of that  p arty does not permit or only partiallypermits the consequences of the judgment or measure in question to be annulled, the parties  agreethat the  judicial sentence or arbitral award shall  grant the injured party  equitable satisfaction.                                         Article 11.    1.  In the case of  the disputes  mentioned  in Article  7, prior to any procedure before thePermanent Court of International Justice or any arbitral procedure, the parties may agree to have recourse  to the conciliation procedure provided for in the present Treaty.    2.  In the event of recourse to and failure of conciliation, neither party may bring the disputebefore the  Permanent Court of International Justice or call for the  constitution of the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 before the expiration  of one month from the termination of theproceedings of the Conciliation Commission.                                  Section  II.    Conciliation.                                         Article 12.    All disputes the settlement of which cannot, under the  terms of the present Treaty, be attained by means of a judicial or arbitral award, shall be  submitted to a procedure of conciliation.                                          Article 13.     The disputes referred to in the preceding article shall  be submitted to a permanent or specialConciliation Commission constituted by the parties.                                          Article 14.     On  a  request  being sent  by one of  the contracting parties  to  another party,  a perma- nent  Conciliation Commission shall be constituted  within a period of six months.
                                         Article 15.    Unless the parties concerned agree otherwise, the Conciliation Commission shall be constitutedas follows:         (1)  The Commission  shall be composed  of  five members.  The parties  shall each    nominate one commissioner,  who  may be chosen  from among their respective nationals.    The three  other commissioners shall be appointed by agreement from among the nationals    of third Powers.   These three commissioners must be of different nationalities and must not    be  habitually resident in the territory nor be  in the service of the parties concerned.  The    parties shall appoint the  President of  the  Commission from among them.         (2)  The commissioners shall  be appointed for three years.  They shall be re-eligible.    The commissioners appointed  jointly may be replaced during  the course of their mandate    by agreement  between  the parties.  Either party may,  however,  at  any time replace a    commissioner whom it has appointed.  Even if replaced, the commissioners shall continue    to exercise their functions until the termination of the work in hand.         (3)  Vacancies which may occur as  a  result of death,  resignation or any other cause    shall be filled within the shortest possible time in the manner fixed for the nominations.                                         Article 16.    If,  when a dispute arises,  no permanent Conciliation Commission appointed by  the partiesto the dispute  is in  existence,  a special  commission  shall be constituted for the  examinationof the dispute  within a period of three months from the date at which a  request to that effect ismade by one of the parties to the other party.  The necessary appointments shall be made in themanner laid down in the preceding article, unless the parties decide otherwise.                                         Article 17.    1.  If  the  appointment  of the commissioners to be designated jointly  is not made  withinthe periods provided for in Articles 14 and 16, the  making of the necessary appointments shallbe entrusted to a third Power, chosen by agreement between  the parties, or, on request of theparties, to the Acting President of the Council of the League of Nations.    2.  If no agreement is reached on either  of these procedures, each party shall designate adifferent Power, and the appointment shall be made in concert  by the Powers thus chosen.    3.  If within a period of three months the  two Powers have been unable to reach an agree- Iment, each of them shall submit a number of candidates equal  to the  number of members to jbe appointed.  It shall then be decided by lot which of the candidates thus designated shall be Jappointed.                                         Article 18.    1.  Disputes shall be brought before the Conciliation Commission by  means of an application Iaddressed to the President by the two parties acting in agreement, or, in  default thereof, by one Ior other of the  parties.    2.  The  application, after giving a  summary  account of the subject of the dispute, shall gcontain the invitation to the Commission to take all necessary measures  with a view  to arriving Iat an amicable solution.    3.  If  the  application emanates from only one of the parties, the other party shall without Idelay be notified by it.                                         Article 19.    1.  Within fifteen days  from the date on which a  dispute has been  brought by  one of the mparties before a permanent Conciliation Commission, either party may replace its own conunis- Isioner, for the examination of the particular dispute, by a person possessing special competence Iin the matter.    2.  The party making use of this right shall immediately notify the  other party; the lattershall in such case be entitled to take similar action within fifteen days from the date on whichit received the notification.                                         Article 20.    1.  In the absence of agreement to the contrary between the parties, the Conciliation Commis-sion shall meet at the seat of the League of Nations or at some other place selected by the President.    2.  The Commission may in all circumstances request the Secretary-General of the League ofNations to afford  it his assistance.                                         Article 21.    The work of the Conciliation Commission  shall not  be conducted in public unless a decisionto that effect is taken by the Commission with the consent of the parties.                                         Article 22.                 ,    1.  In  the absence of agreement to the contrary between the parties, the ConciliationCommission shall lay down its own procedure, which in any case must provide for both  partiesbeing heard.  In regard to  enquiries,  the Commission, unless it decides unanimously  to thecontrary, shall  act  in accordance  with the provisions of Part III of the Hague Convention ofOctober 18th, 1907, for the Pacific Settlement  of International Disputes.
     2.  The parties shall be represented before the Conciliation Commission by agents whose dutyshall be to act  as  intermediaries  between them and the Commission; they may, moreover, be assisted by counsel and experts appointed by them for that purpose and may request that allpersons whose evidence appears to them desirable shall be heard.     3.  The Commission, for its part, shall be entitled to request oral explanations from the agents,counsel and experts of both  parties, as well as from all persons it may think desirable to summonwith the consent of their Governments.                                        Article 23.     In the absence of agreement to  the contrary between  the parties, the  decisions of theConciliation Commission shall be taken by a majority vote,  and the Commission  may  only take decisions on the substance of the dispute if all its members are present.                                        Article 24.    The parties  undertake to facilitate the work of the Conciliation Commission, and particularly to supply it to the  greatest possible extent with all relevant documents and information as wellas to use the means at their disposal to allow it to proceed in their territory and, in accordancewith their law, to the summoning and hearing of witnesses or experts and to visit the localities inquestion.                                        Article 25.    1.  During  the proceedings of the Commission,  each  of the  commissioners shall  receiveemoluments,  the amount of which shall be fixed by agreement between the parties, each of whichshall contribute an equal share.    2.  The  general expenses arising out of the working of  the  Commission shall be divided inthe same manner.                                        Article 26.    1.  The task of the Conciliation Commission shall be to elucidate the questions in dispute, to collect with  that object all  necessary  information by means of enquiry or otherwise,  and toendeavour  to bring the parties to an agreement.  It may,  after the case has been examined,inform the parties of the terms of  settlement which seem suitable to it, and lay down the period within which they are to make their decision.    2.  At the close of its proceedings, the  Commission  shall draw  up a proces-verbal stating,as the case may be, either that the parties have come to an agreement  and, if need arises, the termsof the agreement, or that it has been impossible to effect a settlement.   No mention shall be madein the proces-verbal of whether the Commission^ decisions were taken unanimously or by amajority vote.    3.  The proceedings of the Commission must, unless the parties otherwise agree, be terminatedwithin six months from the day on which the Commission shall have been given cognisance of thedispute.

Notwithstanding that the Treaty ceases to be in force, all proceedings which at that momenthave been  commenced shall be pursued until they reach their normal  conclusion.    (As regards the duration of the Treaty,  the Assembly did not consider it its duty  to decide between the various possible systems.  It recommends three principal systems:         (The first, on  the model of the Locarno-Rhine Pact,  not specifying any period, but    providing for expiry in virtue of a decision taken by the Council;         (The second, providing for a limited period of ten or twenty years, with the possibility    of denunciation on the expiry of that period, subject to one year&apos;s notice, or, failing denunciation-    tion, the renewal of the Treaty by tacit agreement for the same period;        (The third system  would be a mixed system providing for a short trial period, on the    expiry of which the parties might withdraw, subject to one year&apos;s notice; failing denunciation,    the Treaty  would be for  an indefinite period, with the possibility of termination in virtue    of a decision taken by the  Council.)IN FAITH WHEREOF, the above-mentioned plenipotentiaries have signed the present Treaty.DONE aton

Article 2.    Each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes, in regard to each of the others, to  submit to a procedure of pacific settlement, in the manner provided for in the present Treaty, all questionswhatsoever on which they may differ and  which it has not been possible to settle by the  normalmethods  of diplomacy.
