   Proposed Arbltrat,ion  on Dead  Sea  Salts Conc.eGf3j.ono      Since February 1928 the French  Government havebeen  pressing His Majesty&apos;s Government to agree tosubmit to arbitration the validity of a claim putforward by a French financial group  to a concesBicnfor the extraction of salts from the Dead Sea.  ElsMajesty&apos;s Government have always regarded this concession as having lapsed under the terms of the lausanne Peace Settlement.  The  concession v/as originally held by certain Turks, but was acquired by a  British group in 1923.&apos;  The British grouprhaving failed to establish their claims, sold their rights to the French interests on whose behalfarbitration is now desired..,      To offer a blank refusal to the French requestv/ould be inconsistent with, the declared policy ofHis Majesty1s Government to foster the use ofarbitration for the settlement of international disputes.  Moreover, the case on its merits isoverwhelmingly strong, and there could be little doubt of success at The Haguef   It has accordingly been decided that His Majesty&apos;s Government should agree to submit the case to The Hague,subject tocertain conditions, one  of ^vhich would be that theCourt could make the losing party pay costs up to amaximum figure of  1,000a  The Law Officers approved the proposed conditions  on May 20th.     An unexpected difficulty has, however, now arisen, as the Treasury  insist that any contingent                                       financial
financial liability arising out of the arbitrationmust fall on Palestinian and not on Imperial funds,The Colonial Office and Foreign Office oppose thisview, on the ground that, the proposal to acceptarbitration being based essentially on imperialgrounds of policy, any contingent liability should fall on the Diplomatic and Consular Vote-  TheTreasury, however, contend that the dispute is substantially one between the Palestine Governmentand the French interests concerned, and they rofnseto agree to any imperial financial liability boingIncurred in connexion with ths proposed arbitration,until the incidence of such a possible liabilityis ssttled.  The reply of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto tho Frsnch Government is now being held up solely on this point,     Ths extent of the contingent liability involved is difficult to assess0  Under an indemnity agreementbetween tho Colonial Office axid the present holders of the concession, the latter will not be entitledto any compensation, should a tribunal docids infavour of any other claimant.,  On the other hand,the French group, in the highly improbable event ofthsir winning t .sir casos might claim compensation in respect of loss of profits9  The precise amountof the contingent liability, however, appears to bea secondary consideration, as  compared with thsprinciple  involved -  i.e0 resort to arbitration..      It  is important  that a reply  should bo returnedto the Fwnch Government, accspting the  arbitration on the conditions proposed, without further delay. Foreign  Office,      July 3rd,  1930,
