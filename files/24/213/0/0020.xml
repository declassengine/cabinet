I am consulting with the Secretary of State forScotland as to the possibility of obtaining more up to date information.      I may mention that a somewhat analogous problem on asmall scale occurs in connection with sugar beet growing inEngland and my Department has attempted to check the influx of Irish Labour by a special canvas of employers and a wide circulation of the attached leaflet  (E.D.L.10).(Intd.)

MINISTRY  OF  LABOUR.    NOTICE  TO GROWERS  OF  SUGAR  BEET.                 SUPPLY  OF LABOUR.  The  Ministry of Labour is making  special efforts thisyear to cope with the task  of  supplying suitable labour togrowers of  sugar-beet.  Steps are being taken at Local  Offices of the Ministry to record the  names  of unemployed workers  who  have hadprevious experience in the operations of singling, hoeing,lifting  and topping,  or  whose qualifications  render  themsuitable for employment  on such work.  Further,  arrangements have been  made whereby,- in theevent of a local shortage of the type of labour required, any surplus which may exist in other areas can quickly be drawn upon, travelling expenses of workers brought from a distancebeing  advanced to them, if necessary,  by the EmploymentExchanges.  No Unemployment  Insurance contributions are payable in respect of purely  agricultural  work,  temporary or other- wise,,  and, although men may present  both  UnemploymentBooks and. Health  Insurance Cards, the latter only need be stamped.  These facilities for the supply of  suitable labour,  which are  placed at their  disposal  free of all charge,  should  be of  considerable assistance to  growers and it is hoped that they will avail themselves of the facilities offered and notify their labour requirements either direct,  or by  the agency of the  local  agricultural representative of the factory to the nearest Local Office of the Ministry.   When notifying requirements growers are asked to state whether day rates or  piece rates will  be paid, and, in the latter  event  whether they propose  to  use the model  form  of  labour contract  suggested by the Beet-Sugar  Factories  Committee.

                    APPENDIX.      &apos; MIGRATION PROM  IRE LAND   INTO  SOOTLftffD.             Note  by the Ministry  of  Labour. 1.     In  1927,  following  upon  a meeting  of a  special inter-departmenbal Conference  at  the  Scottish Office, held  to consider  the question  of  Irish immigration, efforts were made to  obtain definite figures as  to  Irish Immigrants  into Scotland.    The  information collected as a result  can  be summarised as follows.     (l) General  information obtained  from reports  submitted byManagers  of Employment Exchanges  in  Scotland.     In the absence of a  special test check,  Local  Officers were  unable to  supplyany definite information  as to  the number of  Irish immigrantsinto  the  area.    The general  consensus of opinion expressed inthe reports, however, was that  the proportion of arrivals had declined  in recent years.    (2) A special statistical record  of the number of immigrants from  Ireland who registered for employment at certainScottish Employment Exchanges  during  October  and November,  1928.The figures available as  the result of this record showed that184 persons whose last place of employment was in  Ireland(either Northern Ireland  or the Irish Free State) attended  atthe Exchanges during the  two months in question - 100 from northern  Ireland and 84 from the  Irish Free State.    The areasselected  for this test check were the Glasgow, Greenock,and Lanarkshire areas.    (3 ) An estimate of the number of immigrant Irish labourersemployed  cn State -assisted relief schemes in  Scotland at acertain date in 1927.      The enquiry covered  15 schemes which.showed that of 3,929 workpeople employed on them, about 37  atthe most had come from Southern Ireland at the date the countwas taken....
2.     In addition  to the above  information which was obtained from  departmental sources, information was collected by  other Departments during  1927 and 1923.    Prom the variousshipping companies, information was obtained by the scottish board  of Health  showing that 3,966 more persons came IntoScotland from  Ireland  in 1924- than vice versa, but it was made clear  that no  definite conclusions could be drawn from thesefigures, since it  is not known  v*hat proportion might have returned to Ireland via English or Welsh Ports.    further statement prepared by  the Scottish Office showed that thenumber  of Irish  born persons in Scotland according to the Censusreturns had fallen from 205,064 in 1901 to 159,020 in 1921  (thelatest  Census  figure available ).    Further information was tothe effect that  the number of Irish born persons in Scotland inreceipt of Parish  Relief had fallen from 9,715 in 1901 to 9,3 00in  1925.3.     It will  be apparent from  the above that there is little definite  information available as to the number of freshimmigrants from  Ireland into Scotland.    For various reasons,it  is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain any reliable dataof  this movement.    The shipping companies&apos; returns have been shown to be very misleading, since there is no way of determininghow many of the arrivals from Ireland into Scotland are Irishimmigrants in  the  real sense of the word.    Again, so far asthe Ministry of  Labour figures  are concerned, it is known that many of the Irishmen who have come across are agricultural labourers not  covered by Unemployment Insurance who take upwork in this country without going near the Employment Exchange.4.    With regard to the question of obtaining furtherinformation as to the number of Irish immigrants into Scotland,it would be possible to obtain further reports on the  lines ofthose referred to  in (1) and (2) above.    To obtain this information, it would be necessary- to Issue  a special  Circular                         3.
and, assuming that the period to be covered by the returnwould be at least two months, It would be some three months before the information could be collated.5.    It might also be possible to obtain, through the record Office at Kew, figures as to the number of UnemploymentBooks of Irish origin which have been exchanged for BritishBooks.    Figures already obtained from Kew for the year endingJune, 1928, show that 1,500 insured persons moved from northern Ireland to Great Britain, and that for the year ending22nd August, 1928, 3,000 British Books were Issued to personswho had apparently come from the Irish Free State.    Thesefigures, it will be noted, relate to Great Britain, and It isunderstood that if more up-to-date figures were pegu^ed. fopScotland, showing the number of Books exchanged in Scotland,some difficulty would be experienced in obtaining the necessary information.6.    Apart from the test checks referred to above and thespecial figures from the exchange of Books, it is difficult tosuggest any other way in which the Ministry of Labour could obtain information about Irish immigrants.    There is no wayof obtaining information about the extent of annual immigrationwhich takes place to potato gathering, fruit picking and other forms of agricultural work which are not covered by theUnemployment Insurance Scheme, nor could information beobtained, of persons coming to this country for privateDomestic Service.Ministry of Labour1st July, 193 0.
