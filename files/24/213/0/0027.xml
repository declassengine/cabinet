    [This Document is the Property  01  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                      Printed for the Cabinet..  July 1930.                     ^SECRET.                                      ^                           S   CP. 226 (30).                                  CABINET.The Views of the Governor of Bombay on the                 Political Situation.      MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR INDIA.   T circulate for the  information of the Cabinet  a  copy, received this week by AirMail,  of a  private letter from  Sir Frederick Sjdces, the Governor of Bombay,  toLord Irwin, in regard to the situation in Bombay City and Presidency,, in  relation  toconciliatory measures on the one hand or really effective  repression on the other.I commend the letter to the careful consideration of my colleagues.   I  should explain  that Mr. Haig, who is mentioned, is ihe Acting Home Memberof the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council ;  he was sent to Bombay  for personal  consultationwith the Local Government.  Sir F. Sykes&apos; letter was written of  course before theGovernment of India declared  the  Working Committee of  the National Congress  anunlawful association.                                                                       W.  B.   3rd July 1930.      Copy of a Letter  from Sir Frederick Sykes to the Viceroy.                                             Government House, Ganeshkhind,My dear Irwin,                                        20th June 1930.      I was hoping to follow up my telegram of the 12th June with an earlier letterboth with reference to the discussions with Haig and  in answer to  your letters of the27th and 28th May.   But on the 13th  I found it.necessary to go to  Bombay for a couple of days in  order to satisfy myself that the policy in regard  to processions andpicketing  was properly understood  and that  the  police  and military arrangements were adequate ; and I have just returned from  another day&apos;s visit  to ShoJapur, whereI have been  going into  the question of the duration of martial  law.  While these movements have  somewhat delayed  this letter, my visit  to  Bombay gave me a usefulopportunity of sounding representative opinion and thus checking  my estimate of thelatest developments.   2. I  am sure  Haig&apos;s visit was useful on both sides, and  while  it helped us to get a clearer appreciation of the views and expectations of the Government of India, itwill have enabled you to understand more fully some of the pressing  difficulties withwhich we are faced in the  Bombay  Presidency.  I think Haig carried away the idea that conditions both in Bombay City  and in a large part  of this Presidency cannotaltogether fall into an all-India diagnosis.  Here we have the focus of  the movement,and whatever  may be true  of the rest of India it cannot  be tackled here  on the theory that we are dealing with  a limited political  clique  supported by only a sectionof  the public.  In Bombay City and  most  of Gujarat  we have  practically  a massmovement, ^ and we cannot  effectively apply coercion unless  we are  prepared for aclash  on a very large scale, inevitably involving military action and very  far-reachingpolitical consequences.   3. Another thing  Avhich Haig will  have  been  able  to explain to you is that  inmaking use of the powers  hitherto  placed at  our disposal we have never regardedthem  as  effective, if the  idea was really to crush  the movement;  nor have we ever been blind to  the fact that resistance on the present lines  could not prevent it from making  headway against us.  We have recognised, as  indeed I pointed out in myletter of the  21st May, the dangers and disadvantages  of allowing  the indecisiveconflict to go on, and both we as a Government, and I myself, have made suggestionsfrom time to time of the means which would be necessary  to deal with  the movementmore  drastically, if it  was really the policy of tho Government of India  to do so.  Wehave inferred, however, from the evident reluctance  of the Government of India to adoptextraordinary measures, and from the fact that no action was  taken centrally againstthe Congress Working Committee, that the Government of India, although wishing     4615   75 7.30                                                     A
us  to  keep up what pressure we  could on the movement, still contemplated thepossibility that the Simon Report  or  the terms of reference  to the Round table conference  might  influence the situation, and wished to leave the  door open  for apolitical remedy of this character.  We have therefore acquiesced in what we regardedas at best a temporary policy, and we have interpreted it to mean using the minimumforce necessary  to  meet  the situation  from day  to day,  instead  of  committing ourselves to action which, if the general policy had suddenly  been changed, wouldhave resulted in much unnecessary bitterness and,  in so far as it had to be revokedfor political reasons, Avotdd have weakened for ever the future position of Governmentand its supporters.   Such an  opportunist  policy, involving  a  somewhat  serioustemporary loss of ground, could only have been justified by the uncertainty of theultimate political situation,  and we could not, as a  Government,  contemplate an indefinite continuance of the campaign  on similar lines next season with more seriousactivities to deal with.   It would  simply be a war of attrition in which the Governmentforces were likely to be exhausted first.    4.  Without going in detail into the results of the campaign up to date, which were explained  very fully to  Haig, I should  like to state broadly the position in  which ithas left us in this Presidency.   There can, I fear, be no doubt that the Congress have succeeded in &quot;holding up&quot; a  very considerable part of the Presidency, includingBombay City, and that one reason for their success is that the people generally arenot unwilling to  be held  up.   Considered merely as repression, our policy has notbeen sufficiently effective and has merely encouraged opposition.  This, in turn, hasAveakened  confidence  in  the  power of Government,  and has in places allowed theCongress to  establish a tyranny which  has drawn the timid or indifferent into themovement.   On the constructive side we  have not had enough to put into the scale toretain the sympathies of the Liberals, who are  now being alienated rapidly  by whatthey regard as repression, while they are distrustful of the intentions of Governmentin regard to the future reforms.  So long as this  distrust continues, more effectiverepression would only drive them farther into the opposite camp.  The Muhammadansare obviously  seriously alarmed lest they  should be compelled either  to surrender  tothe Congress  or, if not, find themselves overwhelmed with Government.    5.  The complete lack of confidence and the constant hartals  and interference withfreedom of trade have  brought business  to a  standstill.   Owing to general tradeconditions,  business would in any case have been bad, and, with it, unemployment,bttt the political tension has completed  the vicious circle, and I  hear on all sides from most responsible informants that a very serious financial crisis  may overtake  Bombayat  any moment.   Things are worse at the present than at  the  time  of  the non-co-operation movement in that  at  that  time prices were high, whereas now  prices have slumped.  It is certain that there will  be  a  large  number of bankruptcies  in bombay in the near future; since only  very powerful firms can  tide things over forthe several months which, on  the  most  favourable view, must  elapse  before  normal trade can be restored.  Shares are dropping, and with them  the  profits of the smallinvestor ;  but it is doubtful whether many except the larger business men realise howseriously the  prosperity of Bombay is  threatened,. and the latter  are blackmailed,under threat  of boycott,  Iry their own  clerks.  Generally the public attitude is that things are  already so bad  that  there is  no  use in  supporting the present  form of government  and any change would be welcome.  This attitude is of course just what the Congress have been working for, the  whole object  being to produce an atmosphere in which the  Simon Report cannot be considered on its merits.     6. Government servants, and particularly the police, cannot be expected  to stand firm indefinitely against a wave of feeling of this kind.   Incessant  efforts are being; made to undermine the loyaltj of the  police, and 1 cannot but  feel that  both in this respect and in regard to the attitude of the I iberals, Muhammadans and other classes&quot;who-have  hitherto supported law and  order, we are at present on very thin ice in Bombay.     7. If the ice breaks the Round Table Conference is  doomed, so far as Bombay-is concerned.   I do&apos;pot know how you gauge the position in the rest of India, but I  do not imagine that Bombay would  stand alone.  As 1 see it, the Round Table Conference cannot succeed without the full support of the Liberals ; since any constitution framed in  consultation  only with/Muhammadans, minorities and  unrepresentative persons&quot;generally would certainly be repudiated  and the present situation  would  merely be. reproduced under the next regime.
    8.  The  Liberals  know how far the Conference  depends  on them, and in their present  frame of  mind it is doubtful whether they will  be prepared  to co-operate unless their position in face of Nationalist and revolutionary elements is made more secure.  Unless the Government  of  India define their attitude to the Simon Report in such a manner  as to win the confidence of all  the more  moderate elements, they will probably not  think it worth while to stand aloof from the Nationalist movement.    9.  It  is because  they,  and  the  leaders  of  commerce generally,  realise how profoundly  such a situation would affect both, the political future of the  country and the prosperity of Bombay City for a very long  time to come, that they are genuinely anxious to end a situation which they realise has got  beyond  them.   No doubt they began, as they have on such occasions in the past,  by waiting on events in the hope of taking advantage  of  concessions won  by the agitation of others, and now they find that they have lost their independence as a result.   I do not again know  how far their present anxiety is  prompted by a desire  to obtain the best terms they can before  the coming financial and  commercial crash compels them to put pressure on Gandhi, but it would be unsafe to bank  on any such assumption.  At any rate  the moment, as far as they are concerned, is  favourable to a settlement, and if  anything in the way of a political remedy for the  situation offered  itself, I am sure they would throw their weight into  the scale to secure its acceptance by the country generally.    10. The publication of the second volume of the Simon Report will presumably be the crisis, and it seems to me that the fate of the Round Table  Conference and a good deal else will depend  on the subsequent action and announcements of the Government of India  I presume  that the Government of  India have been in  consultation with the Secretary of State regarding their policy at  this stage, and 1 have always supposed that their intermediate policy has  been adapted to lead up to it.  As I explained to Haig, the fact that the policy on which  we were working was  obviously not  the final one has been making it difficult for us to see our way.  But, at any rate,  now that  the ice is getting so dangerously thin it seems to me  imperative that we  should have a clear understanding of the final policy and  a definite  plan of action  to carry it  out before  a  break actually occurs ;  and  it would  help:  me greatly  in preparing  my address  to  the Bombay Legislative Council at the  opening  of the session on  the 7th July, and help the position generally, if  I could  know very  soon,  what line to take to explain and ease matters.  It seems to me that the obvious alternatives before the Secretary of State and  the Government  of India have long been as follows, and the choice required at this stage must have been rhade some time ago, whether      (a) to make repression  effective and, as  an inevitable consequence,  be prepared         to  put back  the  clock indefinitely as regards  political  progress always         assuming that a Nationalist movement can be checked;  or     (b) to adopt  a policy  of &quot;conciliation,&quot;  i.e. one which will  carry sufficient         conviction to the  country  generally to  have  the  effect, of  isolating  the         Congress irreconcilables.   11.  The  Congress  and other leaders, realising this,  have probably banked on  the Home Government not being able, even if they thought it right, to support effective &apos; repression.  I have  not  suggested  as a third alternative  the present policy   of &quot;construction  cum repression&quot; because, as I have  attempted  to show, such a jjolicy could only be j ustified as a makeshift and is bound to defeat itself.   12.  I quite appreciate the arguments against negotiation in  present circumstances, which  were so clearly set forth  in the printed  note accompanying your  letter of the 28th May.   But the question, as I see it, is not one  of  negotiation  but of creating anew  situation  on  the  basis of the Simon Report and the terms  of reference to the round  Table  Conference.  I also appreciate the fact that it would be  very difficult for the Government of India to make a substantive pronouncement of their attitudetowards  any of the recommendations  in the Report at a very early stage after  its publication.   But my interpretation of the position is that what is wanted to satisfy the  public at  this  stage is not  so much a statement on  substantive questions as a statement of the attitude which the Government of India  intend  to adopt in dealing with the Report.   The public  are too ready to suspect the Government of  India ofworking  against the popular  demands.  They  imagine that it  will adopt what they believe  to be  the  &quot;bureaucratic&quot;&apos;  standpoint rather  than  identify  itself with  thegeneral desire for a full measure of autouomy.  It is expected that British commercial interests  will be considered first and that the Government of  India will yield on such
points to influence from Home.   This is the sort of general mental attitude which hasmade  people impatient of waiting for, or obtaining  by constitutional moans, reformswhich  were almost at  their door.   The  Simon Report at the best is not likely tosatisfy even the most moderate  expectations ; at the worst it may alienate many whohave &quot;so far been willing to  await  it before defining their  attitude.  If, before the Congress have had a chance  of working up  a frenzy  of  agitation about  it, the Government of India were to make a  reassuring statement about  their own attitude,. it might save the Round Table Conference.  In a  matter of this kind  affecting all India  you will of course be in a better position than  I am to judge  what it would be possible or useful to  say at once.  But the kind  of announcement which I have in mind would start  with a frank recognition that the  recommendations of  the Report are likely to faU  short  of  the hopes  of many who are looking forward to something substantially in the nature of Dominion Status at  a very early date.  Such persons might be reminded that the opportunity of suggesting other solutions is   still open to them through the Round Table Conference, and they might be urged  to lose no time in framing considered proposals and preparing the way for  that measure of general agreement  which would enable them  to  substantiate their claims at the Conference- in a manner convincing to Parliament ; adding an assurance that  the Government of India will,  in all matters which  depend  on them, do  their utmost to ensure that the Report  may be considered  in  a light favourable   to  the  natural and legitimate aspirations of  Indians of all communities, and  that  they will do everything possible&apos; to further the Avork of the delegates at  the Conference in placing before Parliamentpractical solutions  likely to  having general acceptance and  to remove any difficultieslikely to stand in their way. I It  might; even be useful to  say that the Government ofIndia have  no desire at this stage to  find themselves in  conflict  with  a section ofIndian opinion Avhich they recognise to  be actuated by patriotic motives, and thattheir task  in representing the interests  of India from the national standpoint willbe  greatly  facilitated  if they  have the support of all  parties,  communities and interests on an agreed basis.    13.  If, however, the  worst happens, and it proves impossible to find a formulaAA&apos;hich will  provide a political remedy&apos; for the present situation, then the  other points&apos;A\which we discussed with Haig will arise for  immediate solution, for I do not expect that we shall have much breathing space after the 24th June.   I will not go into them&quot;in detail  now, but; the upshot is that we shall  require  something in the  nature of a defence of  the Realm Act at once, and that the situation can  no longer be handled ona  provincial basis, but-the  utilisation of forces and the  financing of the necessary measures will become an all-India matter.    14.  I had considered  whether to send  this letter by a special officer who  couldexplain any points of doubt, but it  is  extremely difficult at the moment to  spareanyone suitable.   I would most  earnestly ask, however, that  I should have a reply asurgently as possible.    15.  I am sending a copy of this  letter to the Secretary of State for his information.                                                            Yours sincerely,                                                                    F.  II. SYKES.
