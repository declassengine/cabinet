Lord  of the Admiralty.        Tho  Treaties of  Washington  Act,  19E2,  provided  thatno  person shall,  without a license from the Admiralty, buildor  despatch vessels of  war which did not comply with thejce-atno4dons  as to  size or armament prescribed in  the WashingtonNaval  Treaty.    The London Naval Treaty now prescribes furtherlimitations as  to the displacement or armament of  submarines and aircraft  carriers,  and it is necessary before  ratifying the Treaty  to pass  legislation authorising the Admiralty  toRefuse  a  license  to shipbuilding firms  where  it appears tothe Admiralty neoessary to do so for the purpose of securingthe observance  of these restrictions.   This is done bySection 1 of  the  Aot.        Section  2  of the Aot  repeals Seotion 4 of the treaties of  Washington Aot,  1922,  in  which  power was taken  to implement the Washington  Treaty (commonly known as the  Root  Treaty)  toprotect neutrals  and non-oombatants  at  sea in time of war, inso  far  as power was  then  taken to  try and punish as if for an act of  piracy any person  in  the service of any Power whoviolated  the  rules  that were  set out in Article 1  of the RootTreaty.   That Treaty never oame into force, and it is generally-recognised  that it  is most unlikely  that the  &quot;piraoy&quot; provisionsof  Article  3  of the Washington (Root) Treaty  will ever be revived;  but until  Section 4  of the  Treaties  of WashingtonAot, 1922, is repealed  jurisdiction is given  to Courts in  theUnited Kingdom and British Colonies to try a person of british or  foreign nationality who may be  aocused of violating any of                                                         the  /
the ru3.es laid down in Article 1 of the Root Treaty o  At theLondon Naval Conference it appeared that certain Powersobjected to the piracy provision, and this country is not justified- in claiming rights over foreigner3c  It is incon-ceivable that the law enacted by clause 4 of the treaties of Washington Aot should ever be allowed to be enforcedupon foreigners as international law cannot be created by aBritish statute, nor is it desired that any measure ofjustification should be given to any foreign government to arrest and try as if for an act of piracy any British officer or man against whom a charge may be brought of violatingthese rules or any similar rules they may choose to adopt,A difference between municipal and recognised internationallaw is particularly inadvisable in this connection.A.
