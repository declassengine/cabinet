THE BRITISH EMPIRE COVERS ROUGHLY A QUARTER OF THE WORLD&apos;S-SURFAEE, IS  INHABITED BY ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE WORLD&apos;S POPULATION,AND INCLUDES WITHIN ITS TERRITORIES THE WIDEST VARIATIONS OF LATITUDE,CLIMATE, SOIL,  TYPE OF PRODUCTION AND DEGREE OF CIVILIZATION.  THE:OUTSTANDING FEATURE OF THE EMPIRE IS THUS ITS DIVERSITY NOT merely of RACE, CREED AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATION, BUT OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,STANDARD OF LIVING, NATURAL  RESOURCES AND TRADE CONNECTIONS.   these differences  IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, POLITICAL OUTLOOK AND  GEOGRAPHICALSITUATION ARE  FUNDAMENTAL TO  THE  CONSIDERATION OF THE EMPIREYTRADE.   EQUALLY IMPORTANT  ARE  THE DIFFERENCES IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL.STATUS OF THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN TARIFF AND OTHER ECONOMIC MATTERS.AT ONE END OF THE SCALE ARE THE DOMINIONS,  COMPLETELY AUTONOMOUS-IN SUCH MATTERS; THEN COME THE COLONIES, WITH UNOFFICIAL MAJORITIESIN THE  LOCAL  LEGISLATURES,  FOLLOWED  BY THE  COLONIES  WITH  OFFICIALMAJORITIES;  WHILE AT THE OTHER  END OF THE SCALE ARE THE mandated territories  IN WHICH ANY DISCRIMINATION IN THE TREATMENT OF different countries IS PRECLUDED BY THE  TERMS OF THE MANDATES.Relation of Inter-Imperial  to Foreign Trade.   2.  ORIGINALLY, ALL TRADE  WAS DOMINATED by MERCANTILIST IDEAS-AND  THE  COLONIES&apos;  TRADE  WAS PREDOMINANTLY  WITH  THE  mother country.  THE GRANT OF SELF-GOVERNMENT TO THE DOMINIONS AND THEPOLICY  OF THE  &apos;&apos; OPEN DOOR&apos;&apos; IN THE COLONIAL EMPIRE LED TO A GREATDEVELOPMENT,  BOTH OF INTER-IMPERIAL AND  OF FOREIGN TRADE.

The ratio of Inter-Imperial trade to total Empire trade in these years was thus :             1913        ............     24-4            1924        ...     ...    ...     ...     27-0            1928        ............,   25-9                               NOTES.   1.  The figuresof Inter-Imperial trade relateonly to imports,on thegroundthat goods exported from one part of the Empire to another appear in the returns of the latter&apos;s imports.  This is the method of  calculation usuallyadopted.  If exports were included, the ratio of Inter-Imperial trade to totaltrade of the Empire would be about 40  per cent.; and from many points of views this would give a fairer impression of the relative importance of Inter-Imperial trade.   2.  The figures for  1924 and 1928 include the trade of and with the IrishFree State.  If that be excluded, the percentages would be 24&apos;5 for 1924 and23-9 for 1928.   3.  Re-exports have been included in the calculation.Relation of Empire to World Trade.    3.   The share of the British Empire in the world&apos;s trade is shownin Appendix A.  In 1913 it was  28 per cent., in 1924 30 per cent.and in 1928 about 28-^ per cent.  It has been estimated that, allowing for changes in prices, the volume of world trade in 1924 was aboutequal to what it was in 1913, and that by 1928 it  had increased byrather more than 20 per cent.  Since the Empire has maintained its pre-war  share in world trade, it may reasonably be argued that theEmpire&apos;s trade as a whole has grown by at least 20 per cent, since1913.The Progress of the Trade of the Various Parts of the Empire.    4.   While  the  trade of the British Empire  has grown at least as rapidly as that of the world, there have been striking differences in the rate of  progress  of its constituent parts.  In particular,  theUnited Kingdom&apos;s  share  of the  world&apos;s exports has declined from about 14 per cent, of the total in 1913 to about 11 per cent, in 1928,i.e., by about 20 per cent.  It can also be shown that the proportionof the total imports into  British countries  overseas that is derivedfrom the United Kingdom has also fallen by about 20 per cent., i.e.,from 44 per cent, of the total in  1913 to 35 per cent, in 1928.The Direction and Character of the Trade of the United Kingdom.    5.   We attach,  as Appendix B, tables showing the distributionof the United Kingdom&apos;s retained imports  and domestic exports asbetween  (a) British  countries overseas  (as  constituted  in 1913),.(b) Europe,  and (c)  the rest of the world.  It will be seen that rathercountries and three-quarters of goods imported from or exported toforeign countries.  The figures are as follows: Table  I. TOTAL Value of the Merchandise (excluding Bullion and        Coin) Passing in the Trade of the British Empire.(See Statistical Abstract for Dominions, &amp;c. (Cmd. 3434), page 81.)
under one-third of our total trade (imports plus exports) is with theEmpire, rather over one-third with Europe and about one-third withthe rest of the world.  Since 1913 the  share of the Empire hasincreased  both in imports  and exports.   Exports to the Empirewere,  in  1928, 42J per cent, of our total exports, compared with29 per cent,  to Europe; while retained imports were 39  per cent.from Europe  and 28^ per cent,  from the Empire.  Further,  it willbe noted that our trade with the  Empire shows a &quot;favourable&quot;visible balance,   while  that  with  the  rest  of  the  world  is&quot; unfavourable.&quot;  Our exports to other parts of the Empire  exceedour retained imports from the Empire by about 20 per cent., whereasour exports to the rest of the world are about half our imports from it.  This  is illustrated by the  Charts in Appendices C  and  D,  whichwe reproduce, with the author&apos;s permission,  from Mr. L.  St. ClareGrondona&apos;s  forthcoming book  &quot;Empire  Stock-Taking,&quot;  showingthe visible balance of trade between the United Kingdom and certainEmpire and  foreign countries.   That  Empire  countries buy moreper head of British goods than similar foreign countries is brought-out in Table II below  :               Table It.

   6.  It may be useful to set against these figures similar figures-relating to  retained imports.Table III.

The difference in value to us as customers of individuals in.British and foreign countries, respectively,  of more or less similareconomic structure (e.g., New Zealand and Denmark) are striking,and show the  importance  to our export trade of a  growing andprosperous population in the overseas part of the Empire.   This has-obviously a close bearing on the question of  migration within  the-Empire-a subject which we have not regarded as within our termsof reference.    8.  As  regards the character of our trade, the  following table-shows its distribution  between the  three main classes of  goods  in1928.  Trade with the Irish Free  State  (from which the retained imports  were   44,000,000,  and  to  which the   exports  were- 35,100,000) has been excluded.  It will be seen that our trade withother parts of the British Empire is largely complementary, in the sense that we  import  from them food-stuffs and  raw materials  ofindustry  and export to  them manufactured goods.   The same appliesin a lesser degree to the trade with foreign countries outside Europe,but our trade with Europe consists predominantly of the interchange of goods  wholly or partly manufactured.Table IV.

This is particularly  marked in the case of foodstuffs.  In severalarticles of food the United Kingdom is by far the largest importingcountry in the world.  For example,  in 1928 the  United  Kingdomimported over 90 per cent, of the total world exports of mutton and lamb,  over 80 per cent, of the bacon and ham, 80  per  cent.-of the butter  and about 60 per cent,  of the tea that entered intoworld  trade.The Direction and Character of the  Trade of the Oversea  Parts       of the  Empire.   9.   The  charts  in  Appendices  E and  F,  which   we alsoreproduce  from  Mr.  Grondona,  show the imports  and  exportsof oversea  Empire  countries distinguishing their trade  with theUnited Kingdom, other  British  countries  and foreign countries.The Tables in Appendix  G show the  salient features of  the  trade of the principal Dominions and India in 1913, 1924 and  1928  (orlatest  year  for which  figures  are  available).   It has already been stated (paragraph 4  above) that the proportion of  the total imports into British countries overseas that  is derived from  the UnitedKingdom has  fallen  by about 20 per cent, since 1913.  The figures in Appendix G show that there has been a roughly similar  decline inthe proportion of the total imports into each of the Dominions whichis derived from the  United Kingdom.   Except  in  the case of  India(where Japanese  competition  in  cotton  goods  has   been  an outstanding factor), the  country which has generally gained theproportion which we have lost has  been the  United  States,  as isshown in  Table V below :                            TABLE V..

In other words, our export trade has  been mainly affected by  a  change inthe character of trade, and, while  trade in  goods  of  which  weheld  a  large part of  the total  has declined, new  trades  have developed in which for  various reasons,  including the  great disturbance-bance to our trade  caused by the war, the United States has beenable  to take  a  substantial  part, e.g.,  motor cars and  electricalapparatus.   We would point  out in this connection that the valueof the  total exports of  motor  cars  and  parts thereof from theUnited  States grew from  7,200,000 in 1913  to  47,500,000 in1924, and to  110,800,000 in 1929, while from the United Kingdomthe corresponding figures were   3,650,000 in 1913,  6,560,000 in1924, and  10,700,000 in 1929.   10.  The salient facts about Empire trade which emerge fromthis brief review  may be summarised as follows :       (i) The trade of the Empire with  foreign countries is  larger           than  the trade  passing  within  the  Empire.    Inter-           Imperial trade accounts  for about  25 per  cent,  of           the total trade of the Empire  if the  goods passing in           Inter-Imperial trade  are only counted  in once, and  for           about 40 per  cent,  if such  goods are  counted in both           as exports and as  imports.
  (ii)  The share  of the  Empire  in  the world&apos;8  trade in  1928        was about the same as in 1913, viz., 28 per cent. (iii)  The volume of the Empire&apos;s trade was about 20 per cent.        greater in 1928. than in 1913. (iv)  The United Kingdom&apos;s share of the world&apos;s  export trade        has  fallen  by about  20  per  cent.,  i.e.,  from  about        14 per cent, in 1913 to about  11  per cent, in 1928.  (v)  The United Kingdom&apos;s  share of the  total imports into        oversea parts of the Empire has  also fallen by  about        20 per cent.,  i.e., from 44 per  cent, in  1913 to 35 per        cent, in 1928. (vi)  Bather under one third of our  total  trade  is with the        rest of the Empire, rather over one third with Europe,.        and  about one third  with the rest of the world.   The        Empire&apos;s proportion of our exports is 421- Per cent-) and        of our retained imports 23J per cent. (vii)  Our trade  with  the  Empire  shows  a   &quot;favourable&quot;        balance,  while our trade with Europe and with the rest        of the world shows a large &quot; unfavourable &quot; balance.(viii)  Trade  with  the  Empire  consists mostly of the exchange        of  food-stuffs  and  raw  materials  for  manufactured        goods; trade with Europe consists predominantly of the        interchange of goods wholly or partly manufactured. (ix)  The United Kingdom has lost ground in Empire markets       &apos; mostly to the  United States (in India to  Japan). (x)  The  Dominions  are   now  themselves  manufacturing        many  of the  staple  products, which  form a  large        proportion of our export trade,  while the United States        has built up new trades, e.g., motor  cars, oil, electrical        apparatus, &amp;c. (xi)&apos;  The chief single  cause of the increased share of the United        States at the expense of the United Kingdom in Empire        imports is the  rise of the  motor industry, and the-        comparative failure of  United  Kingdom manufacturers        to compete in this field.  PART II.-THE  EFFECTS OF TARIFF PREFERENCES.    1.  We attach a memorandum submitted to  us by  the Commis-sioners of Customs and Excise  (Appendix H) and a table submittedby the Board of Trade (Appendix IA) regarding the tariff preferences.accorded by the United Kingdom and by the Dominions respectively.It is not, of course, possible to  isolate the effects of the preferencesgranted by the United Kingdom to Empire products, but the observa-tions of the Board of Customs show that, except in the case of tobacco,.the stimulus to increased production has probably not been large.The sugar preference has prevented a decrease in production in theColonies, but is not sufficiently high to  counteract the disastrous-results of the present world-wide depression.  Production of tobacco,on the other hand, has been markedly stimulated by the preference,with the result that  growers are at present faced with  a temporarycrisis of overproduction.  In the case of tea, coffee, and cocoa, pre-ference has had little if any effect on production.   On the other hand,in dried  fruits, wine, and  motor cars the preference has probably been  of  considerable value in providing an assured  market forDominion products in the United Kingdom.   2.  In 1925, the  aggregate  amount of the preferential rebates-granted by the four principal Dominions to United Kingdom goodswas  approximately  13,500,000, of  which Australia accounted for 7,800,000, New  Zealand   2,850,000,  Canada   2,475,000 andSouth Africa  375,000.   Certain of the Colonies also grant preferen--tial rebates to United Kingdom  goods, but the total amount of suchrebates is comparatively small.   The total of the preferential rebateon dutiable goods imported into  the United Kingdom from all Britishcountries in 1928-29 was  7,975,000, of which a large proportion(about 85 per cent.) represented  rebates on sugar ( 3,864,000),tobacco ( 2,410,000), and tea ( 944,000) (which has since become-free  of duty), commodities, which,  with  the exception of sugar, are
yimported mainly from the  Colonies and India and  not from the-Dominions.   8.  But these figures cannot be taken in any way as measures ofthe respective benefits received and conferred by the United kingdom as the result of the preferential rebates.  On some commodities, e.g.,certain types  of  cotton piece-goods, our  exporters would  probablykeep the major portion of the trade in Dominion markets withoutpreferential rebates.  In such cases, the preferential rate represents the effective rate of duty, and there is no very great economic signi-significance in the  fact that a higher rate of duty is imposed  on imports-from foreign countries.  On  the other hand there are commodities,e.g., certain types of machinery, in which there is very keen corn-petition with  foreign exporters,  where  quite  a small preferentialrebate  may just turn the  scale and enable our exporters to enjoy a considerably greater proportion of the trade than they could without it.  Thus the real  value  of  any particular preference varies fromcommodity to commodity and depends in each case on a large number-of factors besides the amount of the preferential rebate itself.  Thesame is true of the preference which the United Kingdom  grants.  Itis  impossible therefore to estimate with  any sort of  precision  thepractical value of the tariff preferences granted by the Dominions to-our goods or by us to their goods.   4.  Attention may be  drawn in this connection to the discussionof the value and costs of preferences in the careful and able Beporton the  Australian  tariff  issued  last   year  by  the  &quot;informalcommittee &quot; of economists set up by Mr. Bruce.  It  may be useful to quote  in  full the passages  in which the  Committee attemptto compute  the  benefit conferred on  British manufacturers by theAustralian preferences :        &quot; It  has  been  alleged  that   the benefit  to the British   manufacturers equals   8,000,000,  that being the amount of the   duties which would  have been  paid if  the  goods  had been.   imported from  foreign  countries.   The  benefit to the British   manufacturer can only reach that figure if he obtains the foreign   price plus  an amount equal to  the whole of the duty levied on   competing foreign goods.  There  are no  grounds for making   such an  assumption, for a good proportion of the British exports   on which lower preferential duties are levied are not dependent   upon preference, and would have continued if the competition.   with foreigners  had remained equal.      .&apos;&apos; An estimate of the value of  the British preference may be   made in this way.  Where practically all the trade in any item   of  goods is preferential, the value of the preference  is small,   and may be neglected.   Where, however,  a substantial propor-   tion is under the general tariff, the full value of the preference   on the preferential trade may be counted a subsidy to the British   exporter.  The  first step counting no value when all  the trade   is preferential will be to some extent an under-estimate.  The   second step counting  full  value  when  &apos; general&apos;  trade is   substantial will over-estimate  the value of preference, because   the preferential and general trade may refer to different classes of    goods under the same tariff item, which do  not compete with one   another.   Put together,  an  estimate  on  these lines  should give   a rough  measure of  the value of preference.   We  have  not   attempted to make  this  estimate  in  detail, but  a rough  survey   confined   to  those  goods  which  compete  with  Australian.   manufactures suggests a figure of  about   1,000,000.   No doubt   there  is  substantial  preference also  on  goods  which do  not   compete with Australian products,  and an estimate  might be   made on the lines indicated above, but  we have not attempted.    to  do so.&quot;*    This passage makes it clear that the Australian economists agreewith the view we have expressed that the amount of the preferentialrebates gives  no reliable indication of the real benefits conferred.    5.   There  can,  however, be  no doubt that the  preferences.granted by the Dominions  0/1*6 j 9iS  L whole, of very great value toBritish industry.   This  is  the  general consensus  of  commercialopinion, and further evidence of it is provided  by the protests which   *  The Australian  Tariff,  An Economic Enquiry. The Melbourne  Uni-university Press, p. 46.[21158]0
;are nearly always received from  the interests concerned when anyDominion  lowers  or  abolishes  the preferential  rebate  on  any commodity.  On the other hand,  the protectionist policy of some ofthe Dominions, notably Australia, has done much  harm to certain british industries and in  some cases the preferential rates of dutyare so  high  as to render the preferential  rebates of little  value.Just as it is impossible to give any reliable  quantitative measure ofthe real value of the preferences, so it is impossible to estimate, inthe case of the total trade of any particular Dominion, whether  theharm  done to  our trade by protectionism  is  greater  than  thebenefits accruing from tariff preferences.  In Appendix  I, however,we give tables showing,  in the case of  Australia,  the  changes in imports  which  have  followed certain  important  alterations   in australian tariffs.    6.   As has been pointed out in paragraph 1 above, the preferencesgranted by the United Kingdom are of more interest to the colonies and to India than they are to the Dominions.   If,  accordingly, wewere  to attempt to strike a balance-sheet  as between  the UnitedKingdom  on the  one hand  and the Dominions on  the other, of benefits received and conferred by means  of preferences,  it wouldbe impossible to maintain that the United  Kingdom confers on  theDominions benefits commensurate with those which she receives.    7.   But a balance-sheet,  so limited, would be misleading.  Thebenefits conferred by preferences cannot properly be considered in isolation from other- matters.  They should  be regarded  as only  oneof  many  factors  binding&apos; the Empire together.  While in  thisparticular matter the  conditions enable  the Dominions to play amore striking part than the United Kingdom can  play  within  thelimits  of its accepted fiscal policy, there  are other matters of greatimportance  in  which the  United Kingdom can be and is  of  thegreatest assistance to the Dominions.   As  examples  of  such othermatters we may briefly quote the following :     (a) Provision of capital on cheap terms for the development of          the resources of the Dominions.   The fact that trustees          in this  country are authorised under certain conditions          to invest money in loans raised by  Governments  and          Public Authorities in British countries but not in foreign          countries has enabled the British countries concerned to          borrow large sums of money for  development  purposes at          very much cheaper rates than  could any foreign country,          however sound  its financial position.   The benefit which          the United Kingdom confers on other parts of  the Empire          by this  arrangement is substantial.   The loans  issued          under  the  Colonial Stock  Acts  at present outstanding          amount to a total of  1,110 millions, of  which Australia          accounts   for    429   millions,   New    Zealand   for           121 millions,  South Africa  for  101 millions, Canada          for  63 millions, and India for  294 millions.  If we  put          the reduction in the rate of interest attributable  to  the          privilege of issuing trustee stocks at -j per cent,  (in  our          view a moderate estimate), the current saving in interest          charges  to  the  countries  concerned,  works  out   at           5,260,000  per  annum  (Australia   2,143,000,  New          Zealand  605,000, South  Africa   504,000,  Canada           313,000 and India  1,470,000).    i^b) The United Kingdom still  bears the great bulk of the burden          of  the  naval   defence  of  the  Empire.   In  the year          1929-80, the United Kingdom&apos;s estimated  provision was           55,865,000, while  that of the  Dominions put together          was under  4,000,000.    (c) The work of the Empire Marketing  Board in promoting  the          sale  in this  country of Empire produce.   The  Board          are now spending at the rate of  750,006 per annum,          provided solely by  the United Kingdom taxpayer, with          the object set out  above and, while in the nature of  the          case  no  precise estimate of the  results of its  work  can          be made, it is generally agreed that it has already greatly          stimulated the consumption in the United Kingdom of  the          produce  of  the Dominions as   compared  with  foreign          produce  and that  it has done much  useful work which          will bear fruit in the future.
   8.  It may be convenient to sum up our interpretation of  theeffects of tariff preferences as follows :     (i) It is impossible to measure with any precision the real value          of the tariff preferences granted by the Dominions to  our          goods or by us to their goods.    (ii) There is no  doubt  that the preferences  granted by  the          Dominions  are of great value to British industry;  on  the          other  hand the protectionist  policy  of  the  Dominions,          notably Australia, has injured certain British industries.   (iii) Existing preferences granted by the United Kingdom benefit          the  Colonies and India more than the Dominions.  Their          value  to the Dominions  is not commensurate with that          of the preferences the Dominions grant to the United          Kingdom.   (iv) But in striking a balance other contributions by the United          Kingdom must be taken  into account, e.g.,  provision of          cheap capital  under the  Colonial Stock  Acts, Naval          Defence, and the work of the Empire Marketing Board.                PART III.-FUTURE POLICY.    1.   The special importance of Empire trade may be said to date-from about the beginning of the present century.  During the lastthirty years, not only has the  Empire grown rapidly  in population and wealth, but many foreign countries, formerly among our bestcustomers, have developed  their own industries behind a growingwall of  protective  tariffs.  The increasing proportion of  british exports going to the Empire has naturally encouraged the concept-tion of the British Empire as a possible economic unit, comparable with the United States of America, but  vastly greater  in area,population and natural resources.  Advocates of Empire unity point to the fact that the United States has a  large and  growing tradewith the rest of the world;  and they argue that the existence of avast internal free trade  market gives her  a position of exceptionalstrength in competing with other exporting countries.    2.   In examining this conception of the Empire as an  economic unit, the first point which needs emphasis  is that the notion of an imperial  Customs Union, under which the  Dominions&apos; role wouldbe  confined  to  the supply of food-stuffs  and raw  materials  in-exchange for the manufactures of the Mother country, is fifty years-or more behind the times.  It is a cardinal point of policy with the-Dominions to build  up manufacturing industries of their own.  Withthis end in  view they do not  hesitate to  impose protective dutiesagainst competition from abroad, which necessarily, in view of thelarge proportion of Dominion imports which  come  from GreatBritain,  means  in  a  very  large degree protection  against GreatBritain.   This policy  is deeply rooted.  The determination of theDominions  to  protect  their   manufacturing  industries   must  beaccapted as  their definite policy, as far as  can be foreseen.  It  is,indeed, recognized as such by the advocates of Empire Free Trade.    3.   This  fact  suffices in itself  to  dispose  of the Americananalogy.  The essential benefit which American industry derives from the fact that  the United  States is a vast &apos;1 economic unit&apos;&apos;lies in the absence  of  tariff  barriers between the constituent Statesand the high degree of specialization  of function between different parts of the country which accordingly prevails.   It is this which enables the advantages of mass-production and mass-distribution to-be exploited to the full.  Tho insistence of many parts of the BritishEmpire  on  maintaining within their own borders  a  diversifiedeconomic life imposes narrow limits to the possibility of turning thevast size of  the Empire  to similar  account.    4.  Great  Britain, on her  side, has reason to be cautious  in-approaching the conception of  the  Empire as an economic unit.A large yolume of external  trade is essential to her existence  and,important as is her trade with the Dominions, her trade with foreigncountries is more important still. If we were to enter into  arrmge-ments with the Dominions which entailed injury to the friendliness     [21158]                                             c 2
-of our trade relations with foreign countries, we might make a very bad bargain; and there is a real danger that a general and compre- hensive system of inter-Imperial Preferences would entail such an injury.   Argentina,  for  example,  is a  country which  at  present represents  a promising field for the development of British export trade, and  in which some  500,000,000 to  600,000,000 of British capital is invested.   But Argentina is  also one of the principal-countries that would be prejudiced if we were to establish preferential duties on wheat or meat.  If we were to impose such duties, it is-difficult to believe that we should long retain in Argentina the great commercial asset of goodwill which we enjoy there at present.    5.   In this connection, the possibility that comprehensive inter- Imperial arrangements might stimulate European countries  to join together  in common tariff arrangements cannot  be excluded.  We deal with this possibility more fully in a later section of  our report.    6.   The importance of this consideration is not confined to the United  Kingdom.   Other  parts  of  the  Empire  are  becoming increasingly dependent on trade relations with the outside  world. The export from the Dominions  of wheat  and wool, for example, is now far greater than the  United  Kingdom can absorb.  Every year, accordingly, the Dominions tend to transact a smaller share of their total trade with the United Kingdom.  In the main this is a healthy tendency, bound up with their development  and progress.  This is also true of the more prosperous  parts  of the Colonial Empire, which affords a striking contrast to the French Colonial Empire  in the large proportion of its trade which is carried on with foreign countries.  The trade of the  British  Colonies  with the  Mother country is about the same as that of the  French Colonial Empire; but their trade  with the rest of the world is about  three times  as great.    7.   The position of the Colonial Empire raises further important considerations  relevant to  the  conception  of the Empire  as an-economic  unit.   The present  stage of  evolution  in  many  of the  Colonies   and  Protectorates  precludes  the  imposition  of preferential duties in the interests of the United Kingdom.  Where local  legislatures are established, their approval must be obtained in  all  fiscal  matters.   Where  there  is  an  unofficial  majority, preference  may be accorded voluntarily, but cannot be  dictated. In  practice neither Ceylon nor the Straits  Settlements  are  in theleast  disposed to discriminate in their trade relations between the United Kingdom and the rest  of the world, and  any  attempt  to impose such a policy  would be  dangerous in the extreme.   In the case of  Colonies with  an official  majority  and Protectorates, the principle of &quot;trusteeship&quot;  would be difficult to reconcile with the re-establishment of the  old Colonial system;  while in Mandated Territories any discrimination in the treatment of different countries is ruled out by  the terms  of the  Mandates.   Again,  in the West African and  East African  Colonies tariff discrimination  against foreign goods is at present precluded by International Conventions of a reciprocal character.  Further, any literal application of Empire &apos;&apos; Free trade &apos;&apos; to the  Colonial Empire is ruled out by the fact that-Colonial Bevenues have to be collected almost entirely in the form of Customs duties on goods  of which a very large proportion comes from the United Kingdom and other Empire countries.   8.   For  these reasons, we should regard ajiy ambitious interpreta- tion of the idea, of the Empire as an economic unit as  being,both impracticable and  dangerous.  Any wise policy of fostering  inter- Imperial trade must be framed within the limits set by recognition of the following conditions:      (i)  The determination  of the Dominions to develop manufacture-          turing industries of their own;    (II)  The vital importance to every part of the Empire of trade          relations with the outside world;    (iii)  The dangers attaching to anything that could be regarded as          the exploitation of the Colonies and  Protectorates  in the          interests of the United Kingdom, along the lines of the old          colonial system.
   A development of the preferential system whioh respects theseconditions must be of a modest, gradual and experimental character.    9.   It  has  always  been  the  policy  of  the  United KingdomGovernment  to  welcome  with  gratitude  any  tariff  preferencesaccorded spontaneously by the Dominions, but never to make them the  subject of  bargaining.   Similarly,  any  preferences  we  havegiven have been given freely to  the whole Empire regardless ofany specific return.   We consider it of the utmost importance thatthis principle should be maintained.   The  great diversity of theeconomic,  social and political conditions  which prevail  in different parts of the Empire  would make  it a well-nigh impossible  task toconstruct a  general  preferential  system which would be  equallyacceptable to every part.  If we were to attempt to bargain with theDominions  and Colonies  for a mutual  extension  of preferences,based on the principle of  equivalent return,  we should probablyfind some parts of the Empire ready for large reciprocal concessions,others reluctant to go very far in this direction, and  others opposedto  any  concessions  at all.    We should  find  ourselves facedaccordingly  with  the dilemma of either  discriminating,  in  the preferences we granted, between the different parts of the Empire,in accordance with the treatment  which they were ready to accord to us, or of abandoning the principle of equivalent return.   Neitheralternative would be helpful to Imperial unity.   The former would,indeed,  introduce a disruptive factor into our Imperial relations of amost dangerous kind.   As  regards  the latter,  if  preferential^concessions are to be  granted in  the  end irrespectively  of anyquid pro quo, nothing could be gained by attempting to reach this result by a process of bargaining, though  a good deal of  friction andresentment might be generated.    10.   We are confirmed in this view  by the  experience of the bargaining  which has sometimes taken place between differentDominions  for mutual preferential advantages.  There is evidencethat this bargaining has had unfortunate political reactions,  tending&apos;to bring  the relations  between the countries  concerned into themaelstrom of party politics.    11.   Further,  the idea of bargaining with the  Dominions forreciprocal tariff  concessions is exposed in some  degree to the danger which attaches to ordinary tariff bargaining with foreign countries.This danger is  that, in anticipation of  the  process  of  bargaining,additional duties are apt to be imposed or proposed in order to makeelbow-room for negotiating mutual concessions.  If, then, the courseof the negotiations does not run smoothly, the final outcome  may bethat tariffs  are higher than they would have been if the process ofbargaining had not been attempted.    12.   For these reasons, we attach  importance to the principlethat inter-Imperial preferences, even if  they may  be  inspired tosome extent by  the hope of obtaining reciprocal  concessions, shouldnone the less represent the free  gift of  the country which grantsthem, and not the result of a bargain.  This is the view which wastaken   by  the  Balfour   Committee  on  Industry  and  Trade,-extracts from whose Final Report we  reproduce as Appendix J.It follows,  in our judgment, that the Imperial Conference is  aninappropriate medium for  any detailed negotiations  about Imperialpreferences.    13.   If   this view  be  accepted,  the  practical  questions  inconnection   with  preference  which   present   themselves  forconsideration are twofold :      (i)  whether  it  would  be  to  our  advantage  to  extend  the          preferences which we grant to the rest of the Empire, in          the hope  that  this  will serve to  stimulate spontaneous          reciprocal  concessions   from  which  our   industry  will          benefit;    (ii)  whether, consistently  with the  foregoing principles,  any          steps can usefully be taken to secure a readjustment of          Dominion or other Empire tariffs  along lines beneficial          to our trade.
   14.  As regards the first question, there can  be  little  doubtthat  a disposition on the part of  the United Kingdom to increasethe range  of preferences upon Empire products would strengthen the  hands  of  the  advocates of  Imperial  Preference  in  everyDominion, and the probability would be strong that some parts ofthe Empire at  least would make a practical response by the more generous treatment of our trade.  Conversely, if it were to become clear  that  British opinion had hardened  against  the  preferentialidea,  and if, so far from granting increased preferences, we showed a disposition,  as, for  example, by repealing the sugar duties, towithdraw those preferences which  we now grant, we should have toreckon  with the  possibility  of  losing some of the  preferentialadvantages which we now enjoy.   15.  In this connexion it is to be observed that even in presentconditions  sentiment  in the  Dominions is by no means uniformlyin favour of increased Imperial preferences.  On the one hand thenew Canadian tariff is a remarkable step in the direction of increasedpreferences, which should be  of  material advantage  to Britishindustry.   While this Canadian tariff is doubtless mainly promptedby a  desire to retaliate against the  growing protectionism of theUnited  States,  it  is probably fair  to say that its strongly-markedpreferential aspect is in  some degree  a response  to  the recentpropaganda of  Imperial sentiment in this country.  On the otherhand, the  recent  changes in the  Australian tariff  (leaving out of account the  temporary surtax) have  undoubtedly  decreased  the effective preference accorded to British goods.  Nor is there  anysign  of a desire  in South Africa  to  increase the existing level of preferences unilaterally.   16.  We  take the view, therefore, that our policy in regardto the granting of preferences  is  likely  to exercise an important influence on the tariff treatment we receive from other parts of theEmpire;  and  we  have  already   indicated  our belief  that  the preferences granted by the Dominions are of substantial advantage to British industry.   This  supplies a  very strong argument againstmodifying  our  existing duties in  such  a way as to withdrawpreferences which we now grant,  and a general argument for anextension of our  own preferential  system,  in  so  far as this is practicable without imposing undue  burdens on our own  economic life.   For this reason we consider that it should be a cardinal pointof British policy to concede preferences to the Empire wherever newimport duties are imposed.   17.  In this connection,  however, it is important to appreciate that  the position of the United Kingdom in regard  to the granting of preferences is materially  different from  that  of the Dominions.Historically, the grant of preferences  by most of the Dominions was effected in the  first instance by reducing tariffs which  had alreadybeen  imposed either  for revenue  or for protective  purposes,  and represented a movement  in  the  direction  of greater freedom oftrade.   The  fiscal  system  of  the United  Kingdom affords  onlylimited opportunities  for preferences of this character, and apartfrom  any  increase  in the  existing preferential  rebates  theseopportunities have already been  exploited practically  to  the full.For  the most part, the extension of preferences must entail theimposition of fresh duties ozi commodities which are not at presenttaxed.  Moreover, if the  preferences were  to be of any materialadvantage  to the Dominions (except Canada),  these commoditieswould require to be either foodstuffs or raw materials.   18.  In order to  survey the  possibilities  under this  heading,it may be  useful to  classify our imports  of  foodstuffs  and  rawmaterials  into  five groups:    (a) Baw materials of British industry, which are  produced in          the Empire in excess of the United  Kingdom&apos;s require-          ments,  e.g.,  wool,  tin  and  rubber.    This  class of          commodities  is entirely inappropriate for the application          of the preferential principle, since  we cannot afford to risk          an increase  in  the prices  of the raw materials  of our          industry.
 (b) Eaw materials of British industry for which we are mainly       dependent  on foreign sources of supply, e.g., cotton and       copper.   The  imposition  of  import  duties on   such       commodities would be seriously detrimental to British       industry, and need not be seriously considered. (c) In the third group we place wheat and other  foodstuffs, of       which  Empire  production is in&apos; excess  of this country&apos;s       consumption.    Here,  in  addition  to  the  ordinary       objections to taxing foodstuffs, there is a further objection.       Since Empire producers have to sell.an important part       of their production in world markets,  the  concession of       a United Kingdom preference would not enable them to       obtain a materially higher price, except in so far as they       were  able  to   turn  the  preference   to   account  by       monopolistic  or  quasi-monopolistic  practices.    For       example, a British import duty on  Argentine and other       foreign wheat would  not  mean a materially better  price       to the Canadian or  Australian producers,  if they  were       competing  freely with  one  another;   for  their  own       competition would force the price down until the  return       which  they secured   from selling wheat to  the United       Kingdom was no better than they obtained from foreign       countries.  On the other hand, in so far as the Dominion       producers were  able to restrict their mutual competition,       the duty would enable them to get a  better price.   In       practice, with organizations such  as  the Canadian Wheat       Pool in existence, conditions of free competition cannot       be assumed; and it  might well be that the Dominion       producers  would succeed,  by   the  development  of       organized  marketing  ai-rangements,  in extracting  from       the British consumer  a price raised above the world level       by nearly the full amount of the duty.  If so, the exercise       of monopolistic  power involved would  greatly intensify       the unpopularity of   the  preference with  the  British       consuming public. (d) The  fourth group  consists of important foodstuffs, such  as       beef, butter, bacon and  hams, of which the Empire  at       present  exports  less  than   the  United  Kingdom&apos;s       consumption.   Here,  undoubtedly,  a  duty  on  foreign       imports would  confer a  substantial  benefit  on Empire       producers,  at  the expense  of  the  British consumer.      The taxation of  essential  food-stuffs is,  however,  in our      judgment,  an excessive price to pay  for the  prospect  of      securing thereby a reduction of Empire tariffs beneficial to      our industry, when this prospect must, along the lines of      the argument we are following, be purely hypothetical and       speculative.  In this  connection, a passage in the Report       of the Australian Tariff  Inquiry, from which we have       already quoted,  is apposite :           &quot; So long as preference is confined, as  at  present,       to luxuries or semi-luxuries, the cost to British  industry       is small.   But if  preference was extended to necessaries,       or &apos; conventional  necessaries&apos;  of any  importance,  ohe       cost  to British  industry  would  be very  serious, and       Australia,  to make  fair  compensation, would  have  to       give  very  much  greater  effective preference to British       goods than she  does  at present.   It is doubtful if  such       greatly increased preference is possible with  due regard       to Australian industry.    Australia  does not desire  to       encourage  imports  from  any  country,  and  British       manufacturers  are the chief  competitors of Australian       manufacturers.....Hence Great Britain could not       expect  to secure compensation in the Australian market       for  her loss of  trade in  other  markets  due  to the       increasing  costs   imposed  by  granting preference  to       Australian  goods.&quot;;(e) Lastly,  there  are  the minor products of  a less essential       character where a duty on foreign  suppliea  would give       a  substantial advantage  to Empire producers  without
          having much effect on the general  cost of living in this          country, e.g., apples, canned fruit  and fish, honey, &amp;c.          These were  the  commodities which the British Govern-          ment proposed to tax after the 1928  Imperial Conference;          and  they  still  represent  the  practicable  field,  under          existing  conditions,   for   the   extension   of  British          preferences.   A duty on foreign  apples would principally          benefit growers in  the  United Kingdom and Canada and          to  a  less  extent,  owing  to the  absence  of  foreign          competition  during  their  export season,  in  Australia,          New  Zealand and  South  Africa.   A duty on canned fish          would mainly  benefit Canada, while  a duty on canned          fruits would assist producers in the  United Kingdom,          Australia,  Canada,  South  Africa  and  some   colonies.          The imports of the more important  of these commodities          are shown in Appendix K.   19.   We  turn to  the  second question, which we set out in.paragraph 18;  namely, what steps can usefully be taken to securemodifications in the tariffs  of the Dominions or other parts of theEmpire which would be  advantageous to our  trade.  Here,  in ourview, the most helpful line of advance is to arrange with  particularBritish industries to send industrial missions to each of the dominions in order to  discuss with the Governments and the manufacturers of their products the possibility of coming  to  mutually satisfactory arrangements in their particular field.   The ultimate objective wouldbe the development of industry in this country and in the dominions in collaboration, so as to promote production in the Dominions where this  can be  done  economically,  having regard  to  all the  circum-stances, and to encourage imports from this country in other cases&apos;.These missions would  be concerned with  other  factors besides thetariff, but by cultivating good  relations with manufacturers in theDominions agreed recommendations might be framed and submittedto Dominion Governments for minor alterations in their existingduties which might prove  of mutual advantage to both countries.Moreover, the  contacts thus established should lead the  AdvisoryTariff Boards in the Dominions to pay more attention to  the viewsof United Kingdom  producers than  is often  their  custom  at thepresent  time.   20.   We  think it important to lay stress  on the other  factorsaffecting Empire  trade relations, to which too  little attention  is sometimes paid.   We may refer to  the  small  share of  Canada&apos;imports of electrical plant which falls to British  manufacturers, inspite of  a substantial  preference.  Here  the  dominant considera-tion is the influence of American finance, but  another factor is theadoption by Canada of American standards of equipment.  In this connexion we welcome  the proposal to hold, simultaneously with theImperial Conference,  meetings on standardisation, with  a view  topromoting the adoption of common standards for industrial productsthroughout  the  Empire.   A factor of  a different character is theexistence of international  trade agreements  in  certain  industries for allocating markets.  Many of these factors  may  seem of little importance  in themselves, but in the aggregate  they are probably more fundamental even than tariff preferences.  The goodwill which britain naturally enjoys in Empire markets,  and which  creates  of itself a  valuable preference of a voluntary kind  for British goods,needs systematic cultivation by the arts of  diplomacy and  publicity.The work of the Empire Marketing Board in  creating a favourablesentiment towards the  Dominions&apos; products in this country suggeststhe need for similar methods in increasing the market for british goods overseas.    21.   In  this connection  we  desire to  draw  attention  to theproposals for  developing  economic  co-operation  in  the  Empirecontained  in  Sir  Basil   Blacketfs  memorandum  printed   as appendix L. We are in general sympathy with these proposals, andwe are  impressed with the wide  scope for  promoting efficiency andfostering Empire development by co-operative  action without raisingin acute form the controversial aspects of tariff preferences.  TheFederation of British  Industries and the  Associated  Chambers  ofCommerce lay  stress  on the  need for some permanent body  topromote Empire  co-operation.   An  economic Secretariat for theEmpire  as a whole, analogous in some respects to the League  of
Nations Secretariat, would  be in a position to devote continuous-study of an impartial and neutral kind to the promotion of empire trade not  only inside the Empire,  but with the rest of the world.It would provide a common meeting ground for trade conferences and  Committees of experts to discuss schemes of mutual advantage in such fields as commercial law, statistics, customs classification,market  intelligence, standardization of materials, &amp;c.  We hesitate to suggest the creation of an Empire Development Board, as putforward by the Boyal Commission on the Dominions at the end  ofthe war, since it is essential to avoid any suggestion that it is the function of any organization in London to influenee the developmentof the Dominions.  The economic Secretariat we have in mind wouldbe a natural development of the work of  existing bodies such as theImperial   Economic  Committee  and   the   Imperial  shipping committee, and its precise functions would be left to be determinedby a Governing Body representative of all the Governments of theEmpire.   22.  The  creation of some organization based  upon free andequal co-operation of the  constituent parts of the Empire  would,  inour  view,  tend to clarify discussion of Empire problems  in thiscountry.   On the  one  hand, there still exists among the  general public some  of the old disposition  to assume that  it is the specialprerogative of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom toconsider the  interests and guide the policy of the Empire as a whole.On the other hand, Dominion opinion is extremely sensitive on thepoint of equality of status,  and this makes  the  United KingdomGovernment  more reluctant to make representations in regard to-tariff  policies which  vitally  affect our  own industries  to  theDominions than to foreign  countries.  If the  Imperial conference were to set up a permanent body to promote the interests of  theEmpire as a whole, this country would be as free as each of  theDominions to express its point of view and play its proper part inthe  formulation of a co-operative policy for the Empire.    23.   There is  another  matter  to  which  we  desire  to  call attention,  the importance of which is, we believe,  far greater than is commonly appreciated.  Personal intercourse  is of the  utmostvalue in developing a sense of Imperial  co-operation and  solidarity;and it is eminently desirable that everything possible should be done to encourage people in Great Britain to visit the Dominions and toencourage people  in the Dominions to visit Great  Britain.   Atpresent an unfortunate impression prevails  in some circles in theDominions that when their people come to Great Britain, they  are received with coldness and indifference;  and this sense that they are  neglected and not appreciated has a  profoundly harmful psycho-logical  result.   A  good  deal  has been done in recent years  byorganizations and individuals  to remedy this  defect;  and  perhapsone  of the  most  valuable features of the  work of  the  empire marketing Board  is the hospitality which  it has offered in this country to visitors from the Overseas  Empire.   We  suggest that serious consideration should be given to the question of how it is possible to extend arrangements which  will make overseas visitors- feel more at home when they visit Great Britain.                        Summary Part III.     24.  The  conclusions  of   this  part  of  our  report may  be summarised as follows         (i) an Empire Customs Union for the British Empire  on  the              analogy of the United States,  is impracticable;       (ii) any policy of fostering inter-Imperial trade must be based              on recognition of the following limiting conditions :                (a) the determination of  the Dominions  to develop                    their own manufacturing industries;               (6) the great importance  to all parts of the  Empire,                    and particularly the United  Kingdom,  of trade                    with the outside world;               (c) the  dangers  and difficulties  of  any action  that                    could be   regarded  as  exploitation   of   the                    Colonies  and Protectorates in the interests of                    the United Kingdom.      [21158]                                              D
 ^iii) Any  development  of  the  preferential  system  which        respects these conditions must be modest, gradual and        experimental; ^iv) existing preferences have been granted by  the United        Kingdom freely to the whole Empire.  Any attempt to        bargain with the Dominions  and  Colonies  for  an        equivalent return might endanger the unity of the        Empire and would  involve  the same  objections as        tariff bargaining with foreign countries;  (v) for these reasons we regard the Imperial Conference as an        inappropriate medium for any detailed negotiations        about Imperial preferences; (vi) we  think  it  is  of great importance  that  existing        preferences should be maintained both here and in the        Dominions.  Extensions of Dominion preferences, as        in Canada,  are to be welcomed; (vii) it  should be a cardinal point of British policy to concede        preferences  to  the  Empire  whenever  new import        duties are imposed;(viii) for the most part the  United Kingdom could only  give        further preferences  which  would be  of substantial        value to the Dominions by taxing food-stuffs or raw        materials ; (ix) the only practicable field under existing conditions for the        extension  of British  preferences is  in such  com-        modities  as those  (apples,  canned  fruit and fish,        honey,  &amp;c.)  which the British Government proposed        to tax after the 1928 Imperial Conference;  (x) the most promising method of securing favourable modifi-        cations of Dominion tariffs and securing better trade        relations is to send industrial missions to confer with        Dominion Governments and manufacturers; (xi) the work of the Empire Marketing Board in creating a        favourable sentiment towards the  Dominion  products        in this country suggests the need for similar methods        in increasing the market for British goods overseas; (xii) the  creation  of  an  economic  secretariat  with   the        Governing Body representative of all the  Governments        of the Empire might be of great  value in promoting         economic co-operation  in  the Empire and  fostering         Empire trade, not only inside the Empire,  but  with         the rest of the world; (xiii) we attach importance to the development of  personal        intercourse between  Great Britain and the Dominions         and  suggest  that   the  arrangements  for  giving         hospitality to Dominion visitors to this country should         be improved.TART IY.-EMPIRE POLICY IN RELATION TO A EUROPEAN                         ZOLLYEREIN.    1.  We  are required  by our  terms of reference to considerfinally the  bearing  of  our trade relations  with the Empire  on proposals which have been made by the French for a EuropeanZollverein.   This  subject has  been examined  in a confidentialmemorandum prepared  for the British  National  Committee of theInternational Chamber  of Commerce, which with their permissionis appended to this Report.  (Appendix M.)    2.  Since that memorandum was prepared the French Govern-ment  have  issued an  official   memorandum - explaining   their proposals.   The scheme suggests a regularly constituted EuropeanConference  with   a permanent  Executive  Committee  and  asecretariat.   The  States  represented  are to be  those  european states which  are  members  of the League  of  Nations and theactivities of the proposed organisation are to be closely co-co-ordinated with those of the League  and not directed against any other group
 of  nations.  Its  work would in the first  place be  in  the  political field  rather  than in the economic, but it would be  opportune to reserve for discussion economic questions, including the realisation in  Europe of the economic  programme drawn up by  the  League, control of the  policies  of  international  trusts and   cartels,  and preparatory work towards  the possible future reduction of tariffs.    3.  There is nothing  in the French memorandum to suggest that there is an early prospect of any proposals being formulated for the reciprocal grant  by  the  Continental nations of  lower tariffs to each  other than to the rest of the world.   We do not  therefore consider that the proposal of the French Government  should have any appreciable  reaction on the future tariff policy of the British Empire, so long as that policy is kept within the  limits vie have regarded  as practicable in Part III  of this Report.    4.  The attitude  to be adopted towards the French proposal by His Majesty&apos;s Government is mainly a political question on  which we are not competent to advise. But from the point of view  of the British Empire we think that His Majesty&apos;s Government should approach the subject with great caution, since there is a real risk of  the Dominions  viewing  with  suspicion  participation  by  this country in an organisation from which they are necessarily excluded. In  this connexion  we would point  out  that Canada has remained outside the  Pan-American  Union  to  which practically all  other States in  America  belong.   On  the  other hand  the risk of the proposed organisation promoting any policy harmful to  our interests might be  avoided by our being within rather than without  it.    5.  It is  possible that  the constitution of a European organisa- tion such as has been suggested might have an important bearing- on  the attitude of the different parts of the Empire towards increased co-operation in economic policy.  The French memorandum is to be discussed at Geneva in September immediately prior to  the Imperial Conference and,  if  such  a  European organisation  then  takes definite shape and  its activities  extend to the economic sphere, sentiment in  favour  of the  greater co-ordination of inter-Imperial policy might be strengthened.    6.  Apart from M. Briand&apos;s proposals,  there has been discussion of  the idea of an agreement between European countries to lower their tariffs in relation to one  another while maintaining them in relation to the rest of the world.  This would be tantamount to a system of mutual preferences within the Continent of Europe and the denial of &apos;&apos; most-favoured-nation&apos;&apos; treatment as hitherto interpreted to non-European countries.    7.  This idea  appears to  have been largely  inspired  by  a desire to react against the policy of economic penetration combined with high tariffs pursued by the United  States of America, and there are indications that the French, at any rate, would not wish this country to be excluded from  any arrangements that  might be  made. It  seems  possible that a distinction might be drawn between high tariff countries, such as the United States and low tariff countries like the  United  Kingdom,  which  would enable this country to- continue to enjoy the right  of  &apos;&apos; most-favoured-nation&apos;&apos;  treatment in  relation to Europe.    8.  Grave difficulties would inevitably arise in attempting to give practical expression to such an  idea, many of which are clearly set out in the memorandum  prepared by the  British  National  Com- mittee.  For  our present  purpose  we are  concerned only with the possible  reactions on our  trade relations with the  Dominions.  In this respect the situation may be viewed from the following  stand- points :      (i) If proposals  for  a  European  Customs  Agreement should          mature and if, as a result, this  country were to  lose the          right of most-favoured-nation treatment on the Continent          of Europe, the case for establishing closer trade relations          with the Empire would be considerably strengthened.
    (ii) On  the other  hand, if  drastic  changes were made in the          tariff policy of this country  with the object  of securing;          closer economic unity  in the Empire, a stimulus might be          given to the  formation  of a European Union  directed^          against the interests of this country.    (hi) It is possible,  however,  to  conceive a middle course which.          would not preclude some modest extension of preferences          to the Dominions and would still enable us  to come to-          satisfactory  terms with a Union of European States.    9.  Our general view is that an Empire policy which led to thecreation  of  fresh  barriers  to trade  with Europe would  be  dis-advantageous to this country. But  it  would be a mistake to assumeat this stage that a European Union must necessarily be prejudicial-to our interests.  Difficult though it might prove to be  in practice,our policy should be to maintain harmonious trade relations, both-with Europe and with the Dominions,  and not  to merge our identityor surrender our freedom of action  in relation to either group.(Signed)A.

CONFIDENTIAL.1930.APPENDIX H.IMPERIAL  PREFERENCE.History and Results of Existing Preferences in                 the British Tariff.NOTE BY THE BOARD  OF CUSTOMS AND EXCISE.                             (A.) HISTORICAL.    THE question of introducing the principle of preference into the tariff of theUnited Kingdom was raised at various  &quot; Colonial  Conferences,&quot; and in particularat the Conference of 1907. For the present purpose, however, it may not be necessaryto go further back than the Imperial War  Conference of 1917, which passed thefollowing resolution :         &quot;The time has arrived when all possible encouragement should be given to    the development of Imperial  resources, and especially to making the Empire    independent of other countries in respect of food supplies, raw material and    essential  industries.   With these  objects in  view, this  Conference expresses    itself in favour of         (1.) The principle that each part of the Empire, having due regard to the                interests of our  Allies, shall give specially  favourable treatment                and facilities to the produce and manufactures of other parts of                the Empire.        (2.) Arrangements by which intending emigrants from the United Kingdom                may be induced to settle in countries under the British flag.&quot;    2.   This  resolution was intentionally passed in the widest possible terms, so asto cover other forms of preference besides tariff preference.   It was reaffirmed  bythe Imperial Economic Conference  of 1923, as follows :         &quot;This Imperial Economic Conference, holding that, especially in present    circumstances, all possible means should be taken to develop  the resources of the    Empire and trade between Empire  countries, desires to reaffirm the resolution    on the  subject  of Imperial Preference passed by  the Imperial War Conference    of  1917.&quot;    3.   Preference was actually  introduced into  the tariff  by Section 8 of  theFinance Act, 1919, under which reduced rates of duty were applied to certain goods,already subject to duty, shown &quot; to  have been consigned from and  grown, produced or manufactured in the British Empire.&quot;    The reduction was one-sixth  of the full duty on most  articles, one-third  on&quot; McKenna goods &quot; (motor cars, clocks and watches, musical instruments and cinemafilms), and 30 per cent, to 50 per cent, on wine.  In  the case of  spirits the preference      [21197]                                                       B
 was granted by means of a small increase of the duty on foreign goods.  The rates o f duty on certain articles produced in the United Kingdom (sugar, glucose, molasses, saccharin, chicory and  tobacco) were  correspondingly reduced.   Except for  the exemption of Empire goods from the scope of  the Key Industry and Depreciate&apos;.! Currency duties, which were imposed in 1921 and 1922 respectively, the scheme of preference thus established remained unchanged until 1925.     4.  But the  actual benefit arising from the Preference varied with changes in the main duties.  The wine duties were increased in 1920.  The duties on tea, cocoa, coffee and chicory were reduced in 1922 and again  in  1924.  The duties on sugar and cognate articles and on dried or preserved fruits  were reduced and the McKenna duties abolished in 1924.     5.  The 1925 Finance Act made several important changes and extensions in the scheme, largely in pursuance  of promises  made by the British Government  at  the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923.   The preference on sugar and cognate goods was altered  from a proportional to a  specific  basis, which was made  equivalent to the amount of preference in  force prior to 1924, namely, 4s. B^d. per cwt., and was enacted for a period of ten years, or for so long during that period as the duty on foreign sugar did not fall below 4s. B\d.  per cwt.  The duties on Empire dried fruits were abolished.  The proportional basis was retained for tobacco and wine, but  the preference was increased on the former and also on certain categories of the  latter. The McKenna duties  were restored, together  with their  previous preference  of one-third  of the full duty, and  this rate of preference was granted in the case  of the new duties on hops and on lace and embroidery.  In the case of the silk duties, the preference was made one-sixth of the full duty, which had been the general rate in the case of ordinary revenue duties.  Preference at the rate  of one-third was granted in respect of the new duties on cutlery,  gloves and gas  mantles  imposed by  the Safeguarding of Industries (Customs Duties) Act, 1925.     6.  In 1926 the policy of stabilisation applied to sugar in 1925 was extended, and  all the preferences (including that on sugar) in force on the 1st July, 1926, were stabilised  at their existing values for a period of ten years from that date, or for so long, within that period, as the full duties  do not fall below the value of the several preferences.  In cases where  the full duty is reduced  to,  or below, the preference,the Empire product is to become free of duty during the remainder of the period. A preference of one-third of the full duty was  granted on  the Safeguarding  duties on packing and wrapping paper imposed in 1926, on pottery imposed in 1927, and on buttons and enamelled hollow-ware imposed in 1928.     7.  The 1928 Budget reduced the  full duties on sugar not exceeding 98&quot; by the equivalent of 2s. 4d.  per cwt. on refined sugar, while leaving unaltered the fullduty on sugar exceeding  98D.  The preferential rebates on  sugar not exceeding 980 remain as before  (i.e., at the values stabilised in 1926),  but a new step in the duty scale was  introduced for  Empire sugar 980/990, on which the preferential rebatewas  made 6s. 10-%d. per cwt., while on Empire sugar exceeding  990 the rebate wasmade  5s.   10c! per cwt.  This arrangement  was  made   to  allow  Empire raw sugar  980/990  to  obtain  the  benefit of the  lower duties,  and to enable Empire producers of white sugar to reduce  their prices in accordance with the reductionof 2s. 4tf.  per cwt. in the prices of British refined sugar which the British refiners were able to make as a result of the lower duties on raw sugar.     8.  The 1929 Budget abolished the tea duty,  thus removing the preference on tea.  No changes in preference were made by  the 1930 Budget.     9.  The conditions qualifying for preference, as  established at the outset  of the system, provide that unless at least 25 per  cent, of the value of manufactured goods from the Empire is the result of labour within the Empire the goods are not entitled to preference. But in the case of manufactured tobacco, refined sugar and certain other sugar goods, while  only 5 per cent, of the value need be due to Empire labour, the preference is allowed only  in respect of the  Empire proportion of their  dutiable ingredients.   From the  1st  March,  1927,  the  conditions  as  regards  Optical Instruments  from  the  Empire, which, provided  that they  fulfilled  preference conditions, had been exempted  from Key  Industry  Duty,  were tightened, and a minimum of 75 per cent, of the value is now required to be the result of labour within the Empire in order to qualify  these goods for exemption from duty.
     10.  Preferential rates of duty do not apply to beer, table waters,  matches and mechanical lighters, playing cards, or hydrocarbon oils.  Empire goods  are admittedfree of the  Key Industry Duties.   The main preferences now in operation are shownin the following table: Articles.		Main Rates of Full Duty.

It must be borne in mind that some of the import values, in particular that of sugar, include a proportion of the preference itself, the c.i.f. price being increased to correspond with the lower duty payable, so that the real magnitude of the preferencemay be greater than the above ratios indicate.                 (B.) THE RESULTS OF EXISTING PREFERENCES.    11.  Imperial preference came into force for tea on the 2nd June, 1919, and for most of the other articles to which it applies on the 1st September, 1919.  It has there fore  been in operation  for more than ten  complete financial  years,  and  hasbeen extended to many new  articles during the  past few years under the variousSafeguarding Duties.    12.  The economic results, as far as they can be ascertained, must be judgedin relation to the object which the policy of preference seeks to  attain.   This isgenerally  held to be the increase of production within the Empire, in order  (a) to benefit the producers;  (b) to benefit the consumers in the United Kingdom and otherparts of the Empire, by widening the area of supply,  and in this way  maintaining a  healthy  competition and  preventing any foreign country  from establishing a monopoly; (c) ultimately, in some cases, to make the Empire actually self-sufficing.    13.   These results depend primarily upon an increased consumption of Empiregoods in this country.   But this does not always signify increased production, sincethe preference may simply  operate to divert trade to this  country from  othercountries, e.g., Mauritius sugar from India.  Whether production is affected or  not,preference may thus have the effect  of increasing and consolidating Empire trade inthis country against foreign competition.Effect on Consumption.     14.  The statistics,  with the detailed  reports  which  follow, show that  theconsumption of&apos;Empire cocoa, coffee, sugar, currants, raisins  and plums, Unmanufactured-factured tobacco, rum  and wine has increased relatively to the total supply of these articles.   As regards sugar, the reduction in  the  preference in 1924  caused a diversion  of  Empire  sugar  to  other  markets, but on  the  restoration of the  oldpreference in 1925 the trade returned  to this  country.  The proportion of Empirerum  consumed has increased, but the  actual quantity consumed  has declinedconsiderably, in  sympathy with the general decline in the consumption  of spirits.The consumption of Empire  wine, until 1925, moved very little, but a large increase
5228has since taken place in Empire heavy wines.  But the only articles where the changescan be definitely attributed to preference are sugar,  tobacco, rum  and wine.  Theincrease in the consumption of the other articles mentioned above is due to a variety of causes, which are described in the Appendix.Effect on Production.    15.   The production of most Preferential articles in the Empire has increased since the institution of Imperial Preference, but only in the case of  tobacco can it besaid  without  qualification that  Preference has  been  the cause.   As regardscocoa and coffee, it may definitely be  said that Preference has had  little, if any,effect on production.   The  position as regards  dried fruits  (raisins, currants andplums), wine, sugar and motor cars is more complicated.  Preference has provided a market for the exportation of these goods from the Empire producing areas, andmay accordingly have increased production.   This country has been the principalexport  market  for Dominion dried fruits,  wine and  sugar,  but  production  inAustralia has been largely carried on  under  bounties  or  other  forms  of  state assistance, and both in that country and in the other producing Dominions the needsof the home market have been of considerable importance; with the result that anyinfluence that Preference may have had upon production has probably been of minor importance.  The import of Canadian  motor cars into this country increased underthe preference granted in 1919, the trade being diverted to Canada  from the UnitedStates of America, and the abolition of the duty in 1924 was followed by a reduction,and its reimposition in 1925 by a restoration, of the Canadian imports.   Canadianmotor cars,  however,  have a world-wide market,  and this country takes only a relatively small fraction of the total export.  Hence, although it may be inferredthat production in Canada has been increased by Preference,  the  point cannot  be strongly pressed.    16.   The case of sugar demands special consideration.  Production within theEmpire (apart from India, which ordinarily has  to import sugar,  and thereforeshould be excluded) has not  increased greatly since preference was  introduced,except in Australia and South Africa and (under the stimulus of the subsidy)  inGreat Britain.  Practically the whole of the  preferential rebate  has  gone  to the producers, and in the West  Indies, at any rate which has been the most discussed,though  it is  not the  most  important, source of Empire supplies the additionalprofits thus  secured  some  years ago  were, for the most  part,  invested in theindustry.  But for this assistance it is  probable that West Indian production wouldhave  decreased.  It can fairly be said, therefore, that  preference has helped  tomaintain, if  it has not increased,  the  production of sugar in the West  Indies (see also paragraph 19).  Although considerable losses are being sustained under thepresent world-wide  depression  in  the sugar-producing industry,  it may be said(see Lord Olivier&apos;s report, Cmd. 3517), that it is due to the preference that disasterin the  West Indies  is being, temporarily at  least,  staved  off, and the  same considerations apply to the case of Mauritius (see Cmd. 3518).    17.  It may be added that the reduction in the excise duties on  saccharin andglucose, which followed the grant of the preferential rebate on  Empire goods, appearsto have led to a considerable substitution of British for imported products.Effect on Prices.    18.  Although it is not a primary object of preference to lower retail prices  inthis country,  it may be noted that most, if not all, of the rebate on Empire wines andon Empire cigars has probably been passed on to the consumer;  and that there hasbeen some benefit to the consumer as regards the cheaper grades of  tobacco.   the sugar preference does not affect retail prices at all.Widening the Area of Supply.    19.  The only article now subject to preference of which  world  supplies have  atany time fallen short is sugar.  Supplies from 1919 to 1921 and again in 1923 werebelow demand, and there&quot; occurred great fluctuations in prices  and  speculativemovements.   Since 1923 supplies have increased greatly, owing to the  restoration  ofthe Continental beet industry to its pre-war output, and to an increased output  of
cane sugar, mainly in Cuba and Java.  Production within the Empire has increased since the war, but at least in the earlier years this was only very slightly, if at all,due to preference, which was probably instrumental rather in attracting sugar herethan in increasing output.Statistics.    20.  The following tables are annexed :            Table I,  showing  the actual  consumption of the Empire and  foreign               goods affected in the years  1926-27 to 1929-30, as compared  with               the average consumption for the three pre-war years, 1911, 1912,               1913.           Table II, showing the proportion of Empire goods to total consumption               for the same periods, but also including the year 192S-26.           Table III, showing the effect on the Revenue throughout the whole period               during which preference has been in force.    It would not be safe, however,  to  base conclusions solely  on  these statistics.Information is required as to prices and other factors which have affected the courseof consumption;  and questions of quality, &amp;c, are involved which are a matter of expert trade knowledge.  The statements made in the notes in the Appendix as to the division of the benefit between the various interests concerned are based mainly uponinformation from trade sources.Effect on the Revenue.    21.  The effect of preference on the revenue cannot be calculated exactly, since it is impossible to say what the course of consumption would have been in the absenceof preference.   Table III simply  shows the difference between the  full and the preferential duty on all goods to which preference is accorded, except in the case of sugar, where the basis of the calculation is the real and not the nominal preference.In 1929-30 the total loss  to the revenue calculated on this basis  is estimated at 79 million, as  compared with  45  million  in 1920-21,  the first  full year ofpreference.    The reduction in the  cost  of preference  to the Exchequer in 1925-25, as shownin Table  III,  was  due  mainly  to  the lowering of  the  duty on sugar,  with a consequential reduction in the amount of the  preference; the increase in  cost in1925-26 was mainly due to the  restoration under the 1925 budget of the sugarpreference to its pre-1924 value; and the still higher costs in later years were mainly due to increased consumption of Empire sugar  and tobacco.  The cost of the winepreference has increased substantially.Custom House, E.C. 3,        June 1930.

APPENDIX.                 DETAILED REPORT ON EXISTING PREFERENCES.                                   SPIRITS.     1.  The preference on spirits was  given by imposing an extra 2s. Qd. per proofgallon on foreign spirits, and not, as with other articles, by reducing the full duty,since the corresponding reduction which would have been required in the duty on home-made spirits would have involved a serious loss of revenue.  The 2s. Qd. was not intended to represent a definite proportion of the spirit duty, which was then 50s. perproof gallon, but was fixed at an amount which might be large enough to make  a difference where competition existed between Empire and non-Empire spirits, while not seriously increasing the total duty on spirits, which might have caused diplomaticdifficulties at the time,  e.g., with France in respect of brandy.  Hence, the 2s.6d.was not increased when the main spirit duty was raised to 72s. Qd. in April, 1920.    2.  The kind of spirit chiefly affected is Rum.  The principal Empire sources of supply are British Guiana and the &quot;West Indies, but certain quantities are receivedfrom South Africa and other Empire countries.  Practically the whole foreign  supply has come from Cuba, but there  is also included in the full duty figure a certainamount of Empire  rum which fails to obtain preference owing to the lack  of thenecessary evidence of origin.  Cuban rum is of inferior quality,  and its principaluse has been for compounding, i.e., the manufacture of liqueurs, &amp;c.  (the rum usedfor this purpose  is  mostly of high strength), but it has also been used for blendingwith other rum.  The effect of preference has been practically to destroy the home consumption trade in foreign rum, the  consumption having fallen continuously from654,000 proof gallons (24 per cent, of the  total in 1920-21, the  first full year ofpreference) to 10,000 proof gallons in  each of the last two years,  about 1 per cent.of the total.   The additional tax did not, at first, cause any reduction in the amountof Cuban rum used, mainly because large stocks were already here; but the declinehas since been rapid, and has been assisted by a movement of public taste againstthe flavour of such rum.  The Empire quota of &quot; Other Sorts &quot; consists mainly ofspirits for methylation  (from  South Africa), the imports of which have fluctuatedgreatly; and of whisky from the Irish Free State.                                    WINE.    3.  The preference on wine was originally fixed at higher rates than on most other articles the rate on light Empire wine (i.e., n.e. 30o of proof spirit) being40 per  cent, and  on heavy Empire wine  (i.e., exceeding 30o but n.e.  42D) being33-^ per cent, of the full duty in view of the fact that the duty then formed only asmall element in the price. The duties were doubled in 1920, but the percentage ratesof preference remained unchanged and their intrinsic value was thus doubled.   Thepreference on light wine then became Is. per gallon, and on heavy wine 2s.  per gallon.In 1925 the rate of preference on heavy wine was raised to 66f per cent, of the full rate, making the preference 4s. per gallon.  The preference on sparkling wine wasalso increased from 4s. 9d. to 7s. 3d. per gallon.  These amounts were stabilised in1926 for ten years and were retained when  the duties were raised in  1927.  But thedividing line between the light and the heavy Empire wines was lowered in the latteryear from 300 to 27c, while foreign wines were rendered liable to the higher rate of duty when exceeding 250  of proof spirit.    4.  The total consumption of Empire wine was about 700,000 gallons per year before 1924-25,  practically all of this being light wines, and had  shown very littlemovement under preference.   It has since risen rapidly, and reached  2-9 million gallons in 1929-30, the figures being as follows :

Before trie war this formed  about  7  per cent, of the total consumption.During the war exports to England were of necessity greatly reduced, with the resultthat the trade had. practically to be  remade afterwards,  and for some years con-sumption remained at about 600,000  gallons per year, i.e., about four-fifths of its pre-war volume.  Imports then consisted almost entirely of &apos;&apos; light&apos;&apos; wine, at about240 to 27c of strength, and, as the table in paragraph 4 shows, the consumption ofthis wine has actually declined.  The fall in 1928-29 is largely attributable to anincrease  in duty-paid stocks owing to Budgetary disturbances in the two previous years.   The  market  for  wine  of  this type  is mainly  among  the  lower-middle and  better-off  working  classes,  and  the  stagnation  in  consumption  may  beattiibutable to the fact that these classes have been badly hit by the continued trade depression.  With such consumers these wines compete, on the one hand, with high-class bottled beers, and, on the other hand, with the cheaper continental clarets andburgundies, to  which they are preferred by  some on account of their greater body.The policy of the trade, however, has been not to push them as against foreign wines,whether called by the same name or not, but rather to recommend them as possessinga uniform quality and distinctive character of their own.    6.  The  &quot; heavy &quot; Australian wine is a sweet wine of &quot; port&quot; character, andmostly of about 350 strength.   Before the  1927 Budget it competed mainly withTarragona and Lisbon wines and the  cheaper  ports, which were of much  the samecharacter, but being slightly under 30o in strength, paid a duty of 2s. Qd.  a  gallon,against 4s. prior to 1925, and then  2s., paid by the Australian wine.   The Empireheavy wines stood no chance under the 4s. duty, but under the lower duty introduced in 1925 the trade developed rapidly, although the preference only amounted  to 6c?.against the foreign wines below 30 \  The Budget of 1927  (besides increasing thewines duties generally) lowered the dividing line for  foreign wines from 30&quot; to 25Q,and thus  rendered most of  the continental wines in question liable to the highestduty.   This gave the heavy Empire wines the advantage of a 4s. preference overthem, the preferential duty on such wines being made 4s. a gallon,  and the  full dutyon foreign wines 8s.  Heavy Australian wines were  also granted  an export  bountyat first (in 1924) of  4s. per gallon,  reduced in 1927 to 3s., and in 1928 (on  winesexported elsewhere than to  Canada) to 2s. 3d.   (The reductions were nominally toIs. 9^  and Is. respectively, but the addition of a drawback of Is.  3d., in respect of
spirits used for fortifying, made up the sums stated).  The nominal bounty of Is.has just been raised to Is. 9ci. again, on the present and future vintages, but whetherthe drawback has also been increased is not yet known.  The combined result of thepreference and the bounty has been the  great increase  in clearances shown by the table, and.  in  order to check  overproduction  and  its consequential  losses,  theAustralian  Government has  established  a  Wine  Overseas  Marketing  Board.Dealers in Tarragona, &amp;c, have tried to meet the situation by blending wines notexceeding 25Q with much stronger wines,  after payment of duty, in order to produce a wine of the desired type which will have paid a duty much less than 8s.   It may also be mentioned that some competition exists between Australian heavy wines  andBritish wines, which can be made with  a port character,    7.  The trade in South African wine, which has hitherto been of a different typefrom  Australian,  competing directly with the ordinary European light wines con-sumed in this country, shows a very much slower growth  than Australian.  The wineused not to be carefully made, the object of the growers being quantity rather thanquality, but the South African Government and trade agencies have for some years been enforcing provisions to improve the methods  of production and prevent the exportation of inferior wines.    8.  The  trade in Empire heavy wines on its present scale is new, and no basisexists for  any statement  as  to the effect of  the increased  preference  granted in 1925 on the prices of this class of wine.  But it is probable that most, if not all,of the benefit goes to the consumer,  the object of the trade being to keep prices low.The increase  in duty in 1-927 of 2s. per gallon was passed on to the public in extracharges of 2d. per bottle and  upwards.  As regards  light  wines, when preferencewas introduced the prices of Empire  wines to the public were  reduced  by the  full amount of the rebate, and, so far as is known, the benefit has continued to be passed on to the consumer.  The increase of duty under the 1927 Budget of 6d. per gallonon Empire light wines was not passed on to the public so far as the leading brandsof these wines were concerned.    9.  The increased preference on Empire sparkling wine has, so far, produced noobservable effect, only a few hundred gallons being cleared annually.                                    COCOA.    10.  The main preference is that on raw cocoa, which was originally one-sixthof the full duty, viz., 7s. per cwt. from 1919 to 1922, then 4s. 8d. per cwt. until 1924,and subsequently 2s. Ad. per cwt., at which rate it was stabilised for ten years in1926.    11.  The Empire proportion of raw cocoa consumed in this country was growingrapidly before and during the war.  It had already reached 92 per cent, of the total supply by the time that Preference was introduced, and has since moved very little.Practically  nothing is received  from the  Empire  under  the heading of cocoapreparations.  The consumption of Empire raw cocoa in this country since 1924-25has been as  follows : (1,000 cwts.)Country of Consignment.	1924-25.	1925-26.	1926-27.	1927-28.	1928-29.	1929-30.Gold Coast Nigeria West Indies Other Empire countries Total Empire Less drawback Net Empire Net foreign Totnl ......

    12.  About 60 per cent, of the total world output of cocoa is produced in theEmpire, but this country only consumes about 10 per cent, of the world total.  Theprincipal Empire producing area is the Gold Coast.   Cocoa was first exported fromthat Colony in 1891, and exports have now grown to over 230,000 tons per year.  in nigeria the industry, which is about 20 years old, is also developing rapidly, and exports are now about 55,000 tons per year.  Together, the two colonies produce over one-half of the world output.  In both colonies production is carried on by nativefarmers on a very low scale of costs, and the Government are endeavouring  toimprove qualities by various measures of assistance and control.  These cocoas rankas &quot;bulk&quot; cocoas  and are, by comparison, flavourless, and,  therefore, frequentlyrequire a  certain admixture of higher quality  cocoa from other sources in order tosupply flavour  and also, possibly, colour.   The only other large  producing area  inthe Empire is  the West  Indies  (mainly  Trinidad), which produces  a &quot;flavour&quot;cocoa.  Production there is  not increasing.  This appears to be due to the fact thatsubstitution of bulk for flavour  cocoas has been extensive, and the price marginbetween the two has narrowed very considerably since the war.    13.  The preference may possibly help the cheapest varieties of Empire cocoasin their competition with corresponding varieties of foreign produce, but it has probably not affected  the demand for the highest  quality foreign  cocoas.  the preferential rebate, when at 7s. per cwt., ranged between 6 per cent, and 20 per cent.,according to the movements of the market, of the price of West African cocoa, andwas about 15 per cent,  after the reduction of the rebate in 1922.   The present rebateof 2s.  4d  is  about 5 per cent, of West African market prices.  The benefit of thePreference appears to be shared between the manufacturers and consumers in thiscountry.                                    COFFEE.     14.  The preference on coffee was originally one-sixtih of the full duty, viz. (onraw coffee), 7s. per cwt., from 1919 to 1922, then 4s. 8d. per cwt. until 1924, andsubsequently 2s. 4ti. per cwt., at which rate it was stabilised for ten years in 1926.     15.  Before the war the proportion of Empire coffee consumed in this country isestimated to have been about 20 per cent, of the total, most of which came from India.For the portion of 1919-20 during which preference was in force it was 43  per cent.of the total, and it has since ranged from about 40 per cent, to about 50 per cent.,except in 1922-23, when, owing to the short crops and poor quality of Empire coffee,it fell to 35 per cent.  For the past year it was about 45 per cent.  The consumptionof raw coffee in  this country since 1924-25 has been as follows: (1,000 cwts.)Country of Consignment. 1 1924-25.	1925-26.	1926-27.	1927-28.	1928-29.	1929-30.Kenya.......... 100 Tanganyika .. . . .. ..; 9 Uganda .. .. .. ..&apos; 12 India..........i 22 West Indies . .. .. .. j 2	107 10 6 38 3	118 11 4 22 4	117 11 3 28 3	112 19 2 27 3	102 18 3 19 2Total Empire .. ..&apos; 145 Less drawback .. .. j 5	164 5	159 6	162 6 .	163 6	144 6Net Empire......j 140	159 160	153 167	156 162	157 152	138 168	819 1 320		318	309	306Empire per cent, of Total ..&apos; 44-2	49-9 J 47-9		49-2	50-9	45-1     16.  This country ranks low in the list of coffee-consuming countries, and thedemand is mainly  confined to high  quality coffees,  of which  Costa Rica  is theprincipal variety.  The output of such coffees in the Empire is growing, but is stillsmall.  The increased consumption of Empire coffee, as compared with the pre-war position, has been due, possibly, in part to preference, but to a much greater extent to
the development of the plantations in the  East African Colonies,  mainly Kenya..which had largely been laid down before 1919.   This coffee has largely replaced theCosta Rica and other similar foreign coffees hitherto consumed here,  as well as someIndian coffee.  The consumption of the latter has also declined owing to a certainloss of cup quality and to a diversion of the trade to the Continent, mainly Germany.The Indian Fiscal Commission of 1921-22, writing, apparently, when the preferencewas 7s. per cwt., stated that it was possible that the Indian coffee planters receivedsomething in the nature of a direct bonus, but that it was not clear whether therewas any large scope for increased production.  The present preference of 2s. 4d. percwt. may operate in the direction of securing the  market for Empire coffee in thiscountry as against the competitive foreign varieties, and  some small  proportion may possibly reach the growers in consequence of competition among the  dealers here.But the amount of the preference has always been too small, relatively to the valueof coffee, to affect the  trade to any great extent, and at its present figure it is merelytrivial, i.e., somewhat below 2 per cent, of the total import value of Empire coffee.                                    SUGAR.    17.  Prior  to  1924 the duty  on fully refined  sugar (exceeding 98  degreespolarisation) was 25s. 8d. per cwt., and the preferential rebate was one-sixth of this,namely,  4s.  3%d.  per cwt.,  the preference  on  sugars  polarising  at  lowerdegrees being proportionately lower.  The reduction of duty to 11s.  8d. per cwt.by  the 1924 Budget  automatically  reduced the  amount of the  preference  toIs.  ll^ci.  per  cwt.   The  1925 Budget  restored the  preference to  the  specificsum of  4s.  S^d.  per cwt., and  stabilised  it  at that figure for ten  years,or  for  so  long,  within  that  period,   as  the  duty  on  foreign  sugar  doesnot fall below 4s. S^d. per cwt.   The 1926 Budget added a further year to thisperiod, by including sugar in the general ten-year stabilisation of all preferences.The 1928  Budget differentiated the duty against foreign sugar over 98 degrees, butmaintained  the  preference except on Empire sugar above 99 degrees,  on which itwas, in effect, reduced to 3s. Qd. per cwt.  The object of the changes in that year wasto encourage the importation of raw sugar and discourage the importation of refinedsugar.   This was achieved by charging the British refiner a scale of duties on hisforeign raw  sugar  (up to 98 degrees)  equivalent to 9s. 4c?. per cwt.  on his refinedproduct,  instead of 11s. 8d. as hitherto, while continuing to subject the  foreignrefined sugar (over 98 degrees) to the old duty of 11s. 8d. per cwt. Empire sugar was treated as raw sugar up to 99 degrees;  a new step in the scale of  duties was  intro-duced for such sugar between 98 degrees and 99 degrees, and the nominal preference,i.e., the difference between the preferential and full rates of duty,  became 6s.  10-8d.per cwt. on  such sugar, and 5s.  lOd. per cwt.  on sugar exceeding  99  degrees.  but when allowance  is made for the protection accorded to the British  refining industry at these polarisations, the real preferences work out at about 4s. Q\d. and 3s. Qd. percwt., respectively (the former figure being  equivalent to about 4s. 3d. per  cwt. onfully refined  sugar). Homegrown sugar is on  the  same  footing as Empire sugar.The Sugar Market.    18.  The history of sugar throughout the whole period of preference has been one of great fluctuations of  supplies and prices.   The price of Cuban 96 degreessugar, which may be taken as the representative raw sugar in international trade,has varied since the war from  30 to  7  per ton, the latter being its present price(June 1930), due to excessive world supplies of sugar.  At this level of prices thereis little or no profit for most producers,  and the Cuban authorities endeavoured, butfinally without success, to bring about a  restriction of output by international agree-ment.  The League of Nations has reported upon the World  Sugar Situation, andtwo British Commissions have also reported upon Mauritius and the West Indiesrespectively, in  endeavours, so far unsuccessful, to discover  some remedy for the unsatisfactory situation in which the sugar industry finds itself.    19.  But whatever the level of prices, the Empire producers have managed all along to secure practically the whole of the effective preference in the price obtained in this country for their sugar.  This fact, relating to an important food commodity
of which the Empire and home producers together  furnished last year over half ofour total consumption, is not without significance in connection with the claim ofthe Empire Free Traders that differential taxation against foreign foodstuffs wouldnot raise prices to the British consumer.Effect of Preference on Clearances.    20.  Until 1924-25 there was a great increase in the quantities of Empire sugarconsumed here, from 110,000 tons per year (about 7 per cent, of the total supply) inthe three years before the war (conditions during the war were, of course, abnormal)to about 368,000 tons in 1923-24, representing over 25 per  cent, of the total supply.The reduction in the preference  from 4s. 3^d. to Is. ll^d. per cwt. under the 1924Budget was followed by a  diversion of Empire sugar from  this country to otherEmpire markets, and the  supply to this  country fell to  161,000 tons, i.e.,  about10 per cent, of the total in 1924-25.   Mauritius, then the  principal Empire source of supply, sent the bulk of its exports to India, its original market before preference.The West Indies, similarly, increased their exports to Canada, where the preferencewas greater than in this country. The restoration of the  British preference to its pre-1924 figure by the 1925 Budget restored the trade in Empire sugar in 1925-26to practically  the same figure as in 1923-24, clearances amounting to  367,000 tons,i.e., 22-6 per cent,  of a  somewhat increased total.  In 1926-27  Empire clearanceswere 482.000 tons, in  1927-28 412,000 tons, the fall being largely due to short cropsin Australia,  in 1928-29 648,000 tons, and in  1929-30 they rose to  723,000 tons,nearly 47  per  cent, of the  total supply.   The amounts of  sugar  of all descriptionsreceived from the various Empire countries in the last six years are  shown in thefollowing table, the equivalent of the total in terms of refined sugar being added to adjust the figures for variations in the proportions between raw  and refined  sugarsimported : (1,000 tons.)Country of Consignment.	1924-25.	1925-26.	1926-27.	1927-28.	1928-29.	1929-30.Mauritius British West Indies British Guiana South Africa Australia Other Empire countries Total Empire In equivalent of refined :  Total Empire Drawbacks Net Empire Net foreign Total in equivalent of refined ..

The total amount of sugar grown in the Empire (apart from India, whichordinarily has to import sugar) is now considerably larger than before.  The bulkof the increase has occurred in Australia and in South Africa.  The margins forfurther production in Mauritius, the West Indies and Guiana appear to be relatively       [21197]                                                          D

The sugar industry is  of  great importance  in these Colonies, where theoutput is mostly a raw sugar polarising about 960.  The introduction of preference,together with  the  general  high level of prices after the War,  at  first broughtconsiderable prosperity to planters,  but  the collapse of prices in 1921 caused themgreat losses, and they requested an  increase of preference.  This  could  not begranted, on account of the cost to the Exchequer, but  it was largely owing to the irrepresentations that the stabilisation of the sugar preference was carried out.  the losses due to the collapse of the market during the past  two years have led to a renewed request for increased preference, and a commission of enquiry, composed ofLord Olivier and Mr. D. M. Semple, has reported on the position of the industry(Cmd.  3517).   The  decisions of  the Government on this report, and on  thecorresponding  one  for Mauritius,  referred  to  in  the following  paragraph,  are contained in Cmd.  3523.Mauritius.    23.   This  colony produces a much higher grade of sugar than  the West indies and Guiana. Prior to 1928 over 98 per cent, of the output exceeded  99Q polarisation,but the reduction in 1928 in the effective preference on this grade  of sugar has ledmost producers to concentrate on 980-990 sugars. The amount of  sugar exceeding99Q now produced only represents some 20 per cent, of the total, and a further fallis expected under present conditions.   The existing low level of sugar prices has caused great difficulties to the industry (see Report by Sir F. Watts  (Cmd. 3518) ).Australia and South Africa.    24.  Production in  these  countries  is,  unlike  that  of the tropical  colonies,carried on primarily with a view to  supplying the needs of the protected home market.  Preference has probably had little to do with the increase in production,but it has served to attract to this  market  the greater part of the surplus outputavailable for export.A attitude of the British Refiners.    25.  From the refiners&apos; point of view, Empire sugar falls into two classes : thatwhich they buy and refine and that which goes as imported into consumption or toBritish makers of sugar goods.   As regards the former, they do not object  to thepreference.  The second class of Empire sugar may be  fully refined or in the formof white or coloured sugars, which have been manufactured by simpler and cheapermethods than those of British refineries and are not so  completely  purified andcrystallised.  So far as the sugar exceeds 990 polarisation, i.e.,  is practically fullyrefined,  the refiners have complained that it competes unfairly  with their ownproducts, since it obtains the benefit of  preference (except in so far as it may be
19235produced from non-Empire raw sugar), whereas the rebate which they obtain ontheir products, in accordance with the proportion of Empire sugar which they use,is of no advantage to them, the price paid for Empire sugar being correspondinglyhigher.  They would prefer, accordingly, that the preference should be confined toraw sugar.   The changes made by the 1928 Budget have, however,  encouragedEmpire producers to sell raw sugar to the British refiner rather than to turn it intoa completely finished article themselves, and the British  refiners  accordingly have little or no present cause for complaint.     26.  The refiners&apos; position,  in fact, has never been seriously damaged by thecompetition of Empire white  sugar.  The total clearances of direct consumptionsugar,  both  white and coloured, from the Empire fell from 140,000 tons in 1920 to59,000 tons in 1925, rose  to 128,000  tons in 1926 and  fell again to 98,000 tonsin 1927.  Less than two-thirds of these quantities would be &quot; white &quot; sugar over 99D.During the  same period the refiners&apos; own output varied from 785,000 tons in 1920to 880,000 tons in 1927, after reaching 940,000 tons in 1923.  Corresponding figuresfor later years are not available, as, in consequence of the Budget changes in thatyear, Empire sugar  for direct consumption is no longer separately recorded.  Butit is known that, as a result of the 1928 Budget, the refiners&apos; output has greatlyincreased.     27.  The refiners also* objected in the past to the subsidy on home-grown sugarfully manufactured by British beet factories, and urged that the subsidy should be restricted to raw sugar.  But since the changes made by the 1928 Budget in favourof the  refiners they have worked in harmony with the beet sugar interests.Effect  on Revenue.     28.  As preference has not lowered the price of sugar in the  United Kingdom,it cannot have increased consumption.  It follows that the revenue has lost the whole amount of the preference on Empire sugar consumed in this country.  For 1929-30this represented  2-8 million.  To this must be added the loss on the reduced dutiesof Excise on home-grown sugar,  glucose, molasses and  saccharin;  this amounted to 1-3 million, thus making a total of over  4-1 million for the year.  (These figures are calculated on the basis of the real preference and not the nominal  preference(see paragraph 17).Sugar Composite Goods.    29.  Apart from canned fruit, the imports of sugar goods from the  Empire aretrivial. A certain quantity of canned fruit (about 7 per cent, of the total in 1929-30and 1928-29, as compared  with 3  per cent, in 1927-28, 7  per cent, in 1926-27  and1925-26, 5 per cent, in 1924-25, and 10 per cent, in 1923-24) is imported from theEmpire,  mainly from Australia and the Cape.  The industry in both Dominions upto the present has not been able to turn out a product equal, as regards cost, gradingand general preparation of the fruit, to the American canned fruit which forms thebulk of the import into this country.  In this competition preference can be of verylittle assistance, since the average sugar duty paid on a cwt. of foreign canned fruitis about Is.  Id., while that paid on a cwt. of Empire fruit is about 8d.,  so that thepreference is only worth about 11c?. per cwt. on the average.                                DRIED  FRUITS.    30.  From the institution of Preference until July 1925 Empire dried fruitreceived a rebate of one-sixth of the full duty.  The amount of the rebate was 4eJ.  percwt. throughout on currants, and on the other  dutiable dried fruit (raisins, plumsand figs) Is. %d. per cwt. until the reduction of the duty in 1924, and subsequentlyIs. 2d. per cwt. From the 1st July, 1925, all Empire dried fruit became free of duty,the value of the preference thus becoming 2s. per  cwt. on currants and  7s. per cwt.on other dried fruits, at which figures it was stabilised in 1926 for ten years.    31.  Empire currants are practically  all from Australia.   Consumption  hasfluctuated greatly. It grew rapidly until 1927, then suffered a set-back, owing partly to a decline in crops, and partly to diversion to Canada,  but in 1929-30 it recovered      [21197]                                                       D2
to a  figure exceeding any previously  recorded.   In that year  Empire currantsrepresented 23 per cent, of the total consumption, as against 1^- per cent, in 1928-29,7\ per cent, in 1927-28, 13 per cent, in 1926-27, 10^ per cent, in 1925-26 and 15^ percent, in 1924-25.  The trade was insignificant before the war.  The old preference,being only 4c?. per cwt., was quite trivial, and the existing rebate, which, it is thought,goes to the producers, is also too small  to have much effect.    32.  The consumption of Empire raisins, despite heavy fluctuations, has grownmuch more rapidly than that of currants.  It amounted to 51 per cent, of the total consumption in 1929-30, as against  22  per cent,  in 1928-29, 42  per cent, in1927-28, 23 per  cent, in 1926-27, 36 per cent, in 1925-26, and 2\ per cent, before thewar.  The decrease in 1928-29 and in 1926-27 was mainly due to reduced Australiancrops, the  result being increased imports by  this country of competitive foreignvarieties.  The old preference of Is. 9c?. and then Is. 2d. per cwt.  had probably verylittle to do with the growth of the trade, but the present rebate of 7s. per cwt. may beof considerable  assistance.  When the increased preference became effective in July1925, sellers endeavoured to obtain the whole of the increase, viz., 5s. 10c?. per cwt.They were unsuccessful, and were compelled to pass on a certain amount of it to thetrade in this country.  No effect on  retail prices has been traced.     33.  The Australian Government made dried  fruit the leading industry in the newly irrigated areas on the Murray River after the war, and  the production ofcurrants and raisins has  increased  from about 19,000  tons in 1922 to 55,000 tons inthe present year, with considerable fluctuations in the intervening years.  The bulkof the production is exported, but the actual exports,  of course, vary with the crop.Canada now gives a preference of  14 per ton on Australian dried fruit, and despiteCalifornian competition the trade is increasing, but this country still takes the bulkof the exports.  Both the  quality and the packing of the Australian output have been severely criticised  by traders in this country during recent  years, but there is nodoubt that the Australian authorities  are endeavouring to improve the competitive position of the trade.     34.  The production of dried plums in the Empire is small.  The main source ofsupply is South Africa, but there are also imports from Australia.  Dried figs arenot produced on a  commercial scale in the Empire.                                     TOBACCO.     35.   The preference on tobacco  from  1919 until 1925 was one-sixth of the full rate, amounting to about Is.  4c?. per lb. on the main  rate of  duty (i.e., on Unmanufactured- factured unstemmed  tobacco containing 10 per cent, or more of moisture).  The 1925 Budget increased the preference to  one-fourth of the full duty, i.e., to 2s. 0^d. per lb., and the 1926 Budget stabilised it at this amount for ten years.  Empire tobacco, there- fore, bore the full amount of the increase of  duty, viz., 8c?. per lb., imposed by the 1927 Budget,  and the main preferential rate is now  6s. 9-^c?. per lb.,  as compared with 8s. 10c?. per lb. on foreign  tobacco. Unmanufactured Tobacco.      36.  In the years 1911-13  Empire leaf tobacco formed only 1-4 per cent, of the total consumption in this country.  Preference increased the consumption of Empire tobacco, so that it exceeded 7 per cent, of the total in 1923-24,  and was 8J per cent, in 1924-25.  Under the higher preference of 1925 the consumption of Empire  tobacco has expanded even more rapidly,  reaching 10-9 per cent, of the total in 1925-26, 13-6 per cent, in 1926-27, 15-2 per cent, in 1027-28,  16-7 per cent, in 1928-29, and 16-4 per cent, in 1929-30. Although the past year has not shown an increase in the proportion of Empire leaf used, the actual quantity has risen by 1-1 million lb. over the preceding year, so that the increase in consumption still continues, though at a slower rate.      37.   Empire  leaf was formerly inferior in  quality and badly manufactured, and therefore, although  it  was much cheaper than American  (which  forms  the   bulk  of  the  supply),   British   manufacturers  had   little  inducement     use  it.   The preferential   rebate  has  altered  the  position  considerably,  and  manufacturers have  found  it  increasingly  worth   while   both   to  use
 Empire tobacco and to educate the public to like it.  The use of Empire leaf has been  mainly restricted to the manufacture of  the  cheaper  pipe mixtures, either blends or  whole-Empire brands, and  excluded from those where  flavour is of importance.   The result was, under the Is.  d. preference, the sale of whole-Empire brands of pipe tobacco at \d. per ounce less than the usual  price (7^d. instead of 8d. per ounce), while in the case of blends the use of the Empire leaf probably enabled a  better  tobacco to be sold at a given price.   The increase of  the  preference to 2s. Q\d.  per lb.  in 1925 enabled the trade to issue whole-Empire  brands at 7d. per ounce, the consumer in these cases benefiting practically to the whole extent of the additional  preference.  Under the higher duty  of 1927 the price of these tobaccos has largely risen to 7\d. per ounce, but in other cases a change in composition by the use of an increased proportion of Empire tobacco has frequently enabled the sale of pipe tobacco to be continued at the old price.  Empire leaf has hitherto provided a very small proportion of the amount used for cigarettes, but there is  an increasing number  of  Empire-blend and  whole-Empire  cigarettes on the market,  as  thepublic become habituated to  the  flavour of Empire tobacco  and suitable suppliesincrease.    38.  The clearances  of Empire tobacco during the last  six years have been asfollows : (1,000 lb.)Country of Consignment.	1924-25.	1925-26.	1926-27.	1927-28.	1928-29.	1929-30.Nyasaland India .. Canada .

The principal sources of supply are Nyasaland, India, Rhodesia, Canada,   and British North Borneo, and in all of these preference has stimulated production   to a greater or less extent.  But  while in India and Canada the industry is of long   standing and  was  originally built  up to supply the home market, in  the other   countries  it  is comparatively  new  and  on  an  exporting  basis   only.   In   most  of  these  countries  the  Governments  are  taking  an  active  part  in   aiding the development  of the industry, and the Imperial  Tobacco  Company   has  rehandling  plants  in  Nyasaland,  Southern  Rhodesia and  Canada.   InI  India  production  has  always  been  large  and  quality poor,  ando  the main1  effect  of preference  ha,s  been to bring  into  existence  a large export trade to   this  country in cheap, low-grade, but well-manufactured tobacco, which now forms   about  one-third  of  the  total  consumption  of Empire  tobacco in  this  country.I  Nyasaland tobacco, which also forms about one-third of the consumption here of   Empire tobacco, has mostly had a somewhat pronounced flavour which has rendered   its use unsuitable except  in the cheaper pipe tobaccos, but great improvements in   quality are being made by  the planters.  Rhodesian leaf is the main Empire cigarette   tobacco.   The natural,  but somewhat restricted, market for  the output is Southj  Africa, which grants a preference substantially higher than the United Kingdom,i  but the major proportion  of the output now comes  to this country.  The increased1  demand  for this variety in recent years led to  over-production,  resulting in largeI  exports of leaf either of poor quality or badly cured, graded, and packed.  This notH  merely depressed the market for Rhodesian leaf but  also adversely affected the1!  position  of other preferential tobaccos, and has resulted in curtailed production, asH  shown  by the figures below.   The Canadian industry has  in the  past been over-H  shadowed by the American, but it is now engaged increasingly in competition with
the latter on a quality basis, and a considerable influx of farmers from Kentuckyinto Ontario has recently taken place.   Production was 17^ million lb. before thewar (in 1910), but has fluctuated greatly since; by 1921 it was only 13 million lb.; in1927 it had risen to 47 million lb.; but by 1929 it had fallen to 30 million lb.  Theexpansion since 1921, in which year exportation to this country on a large  scalebegan, must largely be attributed to the preference.  British North Borneo producescigar tobacco of relatively high quality (see import values in paragraph 40), but, asthe consumption of cigars in this country is stagnant, the industry has moved  little of recent years.  The movement of production under preference in certain of  thesecountries has been as follows : (Million lb.)---	1919. 1926.		1927.	1928.	1929.Nyasaland Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Northern	1 0-6 (1920)	9 6 2	151 19 3	&quot;1 24 1*	101 4 (not available)    40.  The  average import values (c.i.f.)  of unmanufactured tobacco from themain Empire countries, as compared with the United States, over the last six years have been: (Pence per lb.)	1924.	1925.	1926.	1927.	1928.	1929.British North Borneo Rhodesian Canadian . * Nyasaland Indian American .. .. ;	50-3 16-5 19-1 16-9 9-0 21-5	45-1 19-9 18-5 16-6 9-6 19-8	44-2 23-6 20-6 17-5 10-1 20-3	45-8 21-8 22-3 18-8 10-5 19-2	46-1 17-4 18-1 16-9 9-4 18-4	42-3 14-3 16-8 15-6 8-7 17-5    41.  The  distribution  of  the preference has varied according to the class  of tobacco concerned and the  state of the market.  Complaints were made under theold Is. 4d. preference by producers in  Rhodesia and Nyasaland against the small proportion of the preference  going to  them,  and this attitude was supported  bystatements made in  a  book,  entitled  &quot;Rubber, Tea and Cacao,&quot; issued by theFederation of British Industries in  1924, which stated that little, if any,  of thepreference reached the growers.  But until the severe setback of the past two years the increase in the demand for preferential tobacco enabled producers to secure  anincreased share  of the preference  in the prices they realised; the general upward trend of many of the average import prices shown above  until 1928 is perhaps  ofsignificance in this connection.  As a consequence of the fall in prices the Nyasalandplanters last year raised the question of moving the Empire Marketing Board  toendeavour to secure the return of a portion of the preference to the exporter in thecountry of origin. As regards the additional rebate of 8d. per lb., granted in 1925,it has already been noted that the retail price of proprietary brands of pipe tobaccomade wholly of Empire  leaf was reduced by that amount.    42.  The  Indian Fiscal Commission  of  1921-22 stated that,  even with thepreference, Indian tobacco was at a disadvantage in the English market as comparedwith  other tobaccos.  This,  however,  is due to the fact that Indian tobacco  is relatively very poor in quality (see import values given above).  But preference has,to some extent at least,  improved the position, as without it Indian tobacco wouldhave no, remunerative  market at all in this country.  The Indian Trade commissioner in London  (Mr. A.  F.  Lindsay),  in evidence before  the Royal Commission  on agriculture in India, 1927,  apparently agreed that  preference had increased theexport of leaf tobacco from India.
Manufactured  Tobacco.    43.  Empire cigars are imported mainly from India.  These are of comparativelyinferior quality,  and enter  into competition rather with British cigars than withother imported cigars.   The cigar trade as a whole has been stagnant for years,cigars being replaced in public favour by cigarettes, but preference, by reducing theprice of Empire  cigars, has presumably enabled them to hold  their position betterthan  they otherwise would  have done.   The only other manufactured tobacco of empire origin consists of a little &quot; Boer tobacco &quot; from South Africa and very small quantities of cigarettes.                                 MOTOR CARS.     44.  A rebate of one-third of the full  duty was  granted in respect of the McKenna  duties on the institution of Imperial Preference in 1919, and remained in force until the abolition of  the duties in  1924.  On their restoration in July 1925, after a lapse of eleven months, the original preference was also  restored.  The only McKenna  goods  of importance from the point of view of preference are motor cars. The  Empire  cars  are principally  Canadian, manufactured by  American firms (e.g., General Motors,  Chrysler), established on both sides of the border, which use their Canadian factories largely to cater for their trade within the British Empire. A certain proportion of the total imports also consists of Ford parts from the Irish Free State.     45.  Cars of Empire origin formed about 4 per cent, of  the value of the  total clearances  of imported dutiable vehicles in 1920-21, but the proportion rose rapidly, and during 1923-24. and the few months of  1924-25  before the  abolition of the . duties, it amounted to about 36 per cent,  of the total.  The abolition of the duty in 1924 led to a reduction in the imports of Canadian and an increase  in  imports of American cars.  The  reimposition of the duties restored the Empire proportion to 37  per  cent, in  192S-26.  In 1926-27 it amounted to 18 per cent, of the total clearances  of  imported cars, in 1927-28 to 26 per cent.,  in 1928-29  to 21 per cent. and in 1929-30 to  15  per cent.  But  the movement of these  figures is misleading, since the &apos;&apos; full duty &quot;  figures for 1929-30 were swollen by the inclusion of arrears representing clearances in earlier years.  Empire imports have fluctuated greatly in amount since  the reimposition of the duties in 1925.  They rose from  1 million in 1926-27 to  2-2 million in the following year, and have since  fallen by 50 per cent. to  1-1  million  in 1929-30.   No comparable figures exist for the period before preference,  as  dutiable  and  exempt cars  were  not  distinguished  before  the duty was imposed  in  September 1915, and shortly afterwards (March 1916)  the importation of dutiable cars was prohibited except under licence.  The exemptions in favour of commercial  vehicles and tyres, granted when the duties were imposed, were withdrawn  in 1926 and 1927 respectively.     46.  The  foreign  imports,  other  than American, consist  mainly of  French, Italian and Belgian cars. Imports from these countries  include a large proportion of small cars of the low nominal horsepower, high  efficiency engine type, economical in running costs, which are in competition with English cars of similar character, rather than with the bigger cars of larger  nominal  horsepower of the American type to which the bulk of the Canadian imports into this  country belong.   The fall in the imports of Empire products over  the past three years has been largely due to a transfer of  production from Canada  to this  country and does  not imply  the replacement of Empire by foreign products. Nor,  in view of the different characterof the respective  markets involved, does the increase in the imports of foreign  cars which has taken place  imply any similar substitution, but must be attributed to thegeneral growth of motoring in this country.  In this connection it may be noted  that the total output of cars in this country rose from 155,000  in 1928 to 180,000 in 1929.Q

APPENDIX J.PREFERENCES AND BARGAINING.Extracts from the Final Report of the Balfour Committee on Industry                           and Trade.    &quot; THE great importance  of our present trade with other parts ofthe Empire is sufficiently indicated by the fact that between 40 and50  per cent,  of our fotal exports  are  directed to  Empire  markets,while the substantial value of the Dominion and Colonial preferencesis shown by  the fact that the preferential tariffs of the  Dominions&apos;are, on the average, less than their general tariffs  by approximately9 per cent, ad valorem.  No foreign markets absorb nearly so greatan  amount of British goods per head of  their population as NewZealand  and Australia,  while (with  the sole  exception of  theArgentine) the same is true of South Africa and Canada.  The  abovefour Dominions, taken together, purchase British goods to an amount equal to nearly  6 per head of  their population, as compared with about 10s. for France, Germany and the United States.    &quot; Such figures, supported as they are by the  testimony of thetrade witnesses who appeared before us, are amply  sufficient to show the great value and importance to  British traders of the preferentialaccess  which  they enjoy to certain Empire markets.  In view  of thefacts, it cannot admit of doubt that the  preservation and  develop-ment of these  advantages must be one of the cardinal  objects ofBritish commercial policy.    &apos;&apos; Before considering by what means the permanence of imperial preference can best be  ensured,  it is desirable to recall that the modern practice of preferential Customs treatment, as it has grownup  in  the  self-governing  Dominions,  is founded  on  two  basic principles of  equal importance     (a)  complete autonomy in the construction of tariffs so  as to suit          the needs and conditions of the country concerned;    (b) so far as is consistent with the above principle, the admission          of  goods of British origin on specially favourable terms as          compared with imports from other countries.The idea of definite reciprocal tariff bargains between Great Britainand other Empire Governments,  fixing the  terms on which  inter-Imperial trade should be carried  on,  is quite alien to the modernspirit and pi&apos;actice of Imperial preference.&quot;        *            *           *            -*            *    &apos;&apos; reference has already been made to the great value to our trade  of  preferential  access  to Dominion  markets, and to  theimportance of reciprocating  in some adequate and suitable  manner,not only as a gesture of goodwill, but as one means of ensuring thatthe preferences we at present enjoy shall be maintained. It has been indicated  that the  fundamental conditions governing  our  economic life  forbid reciprocation  by  the precise  means  which some of theDominions might  prefer, and make it impracticable to construct theUnited Kingdom  tariff primarily  with a view to  the extension ofImperial  preference.    Nevertheless,   the  aim  of  reciprocatingDominion preference by all suitable means which are consistent withthe  essential interests of the  population  of  Great Britain is onewhich, in our judgment,  should be regarded as a necessary qualifica-tion of the normal &apos;&apos; type &apos;&apos;  of British tariff policy,  even if it cannotbe the  basis of that policy.&quot;

APPENDIX L.    Copy of Letter,  with Enclosure, from Sir Basil Blackett.                           Electra House,  Moorgate,Dear Prime Minister,           London, E.C. 2, April 8, 1930.   I  HAVE the  honour  to  enclose a  Memorandum  on ImperialEconomic Co-operation in the hope that it may be of use to HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the work of preparing  for the  comingImperial Conference.  The  responsibility for  the  views  expressedin the Memorandum is entirely mine, but it represents the outcome of a series of meetings of a  Study Circle held at my house duringthe  autumn  and winter.  The  subject  of  Imperial   economic co-operation was looked  at from as many aspects  as possible, andthe Memorandum itself  has been drawn up in consultation with various members of the  Group.  The Group  was representative ofall shades of opinion, and approached  the  subject  from  the  stand-point that the tariff  question was only one and that a  minor one among  the  many  aspects of a  subject which   has  very wideramifications.                              Yours faithfully,                        (Signed)      BASIL P.  BLACKETT.The Rt. Hon. J. Bamsay MacDonald, M.P.,       10, Downing  Street,  S.W. 1.                Imperial Economic Co-operation.   1.  The time has gone by when Great Britain by herself can maintain not merely her preponderating commercial and industrial position in the world, but even any  reasonable economic  life  forher people.  Modern  science and  modern  machinery  demand a.wider sphere of action than can any longer be provided within the narrow limits of the United Kingdom.  All over the world the road to material economic advancement is from the smaller economic unit  to the greater.   2.  There is  nothing  aggressive in the belief  that there are-British  standards, British traditions  and a British  way  of  lifewhich have made, and are still capable of making,  a big contribu-tion  to  the welfare  and happiness of humanity,  and  are worthpreserving and defending.  The conception of the British  Empire-as an economic family does not and ought not to imply an ImperialEconomic Unit, self-sufficing, aggressively exclusive and enclosedwithin prohibitive tariff walls.  The approach to a natural economic organisation of the world  must be  through  the  diversity in unity of a  number of economic families,  each contributing a  certainindividuality  of culture.   3.  In  the  resolution  determining the constitutional relationsbetween the Dominions and Grea,t  Britain, the Conference of 1926did more than remove political difficulties.  It pointed to the needfor combined action,  and  in  insisting upon constitutional  equalitymade practical co-operation between  the partner countries of the-Empire  more attainable.   The  resolution said  of the Empire:&quot;Free co-operation  is its  instrument.   Though every Dominionis now, and must always remain,  the  sole judge of  the nature and extent of  its  co-operation,  no common cause will, in  our opinion,be thereby imperilled.&quot;   4.  With the emphasis shifted  from political and constitutionalto economic questions, free co-operation has developed rapidly since1926.  But the  machinery of Imperial economic  co-operation lagsbehind.    Most of the bodies officially concerned  with economic co-operation have been set  up by the Government of Great Britain,and  are  subject to the financial control  of  the British Treasury.The  Imperial Institute, which  is  a clearing-house  of technical     [21158-7]                                          B
knowledge in regard to  the  raw materials  and mineral resources-of the Empire, is a sub-department of the Department of OverseasTrade.   The  Empire  Marketing Board,  a  more  recent  creation,is  composed  of representatives  of  Empire  Governments,  butexecutive and financial control rests with British  Ministers.  TheImperial   Economic   Committee   and   the  Imperial   shipping committee  report  to  the  Governments  of  the  Empire,  but their staff and expenditure are the concern  of the British  Govern-ment.   The  Imperial  Conference itself has  no  machinery for-continuous study of common economic problems.    5.  If economic co-operation is  to be organised, some  recastingof the present machinery  is necessary.  There must be no room for suspicion  that Great Britain may be seeking  under the guiseof economic co-operation to reassert an authority to which she hasabandoned all claim in the political field.  Great Britain is entitledand indeed called upon to act as the cultural and scientific centre of the Empire and to take the lead in promoting Imperial co-opera-tion.  But if  the ideal of  the Empire  as an Economic Family isto be realisable, co-operation must be on  the basis  of  free  and willing association,  and full scope must be left for that harmoniseddiversity in unity  which is the keynote of intra-Imperial relations in the economic as in the political sphere.    6.  The stress hitherto laid on tariff questions in all discussions of Imperial Economic Co-operation may hinder rather than promote the growth of the habit of co-operation.  Tariffs represent only oneportion,  and  that  a minor  one,  of the much larger subject of-economic co-operation.    7.  If proof were needed of this statement,  it is forthcomingin the many and varied advances made in the direction of Imperial-economic co-operation which have been  effected  in  recent  years.In the field  of agricultural research, the  Imperial  AgriculturalBesearch  Conference  of  1927  has  knit together  the  scientificauthorities of the various Empire  Governments and led to a rapidextension of team work.  A few examples of the increasing contracts in  this field  may be given.  An investigation of great  economic importance into the mineral contents of pastures, springing from work originally done at Onderstepoort, near Pretoria, and basedon  the  Bowett  Besearch  Institute at  Aberdeen,  now  has  itsextensions  in Australia,  New  Zealand,  Kenya  and  SouthernBhodesia.   Leading scientists from the United Kingdom have been officially  invited  to visit  the  Dominions  and  to  review  theirproblems.   Sir Arnold Theiler and Dr. Orr have  visited Australiaand New Zealand.  Dr.  Hill,  the Director of Kew  Gardens, hasmade a  tour  in the Pacific.  A Scottish  fishery expert is  about to visit and report upon the fisheries of Newfoundland.  A wool expertfrom the Torridon Research  Station has toured the Dominions andis about to produce a survey of the Empire&apos;s wool production. Bya reverse process  Dr.  Huntsman,  the  Director of the  MarianBiological Laboratories of  Canada,  has been invited to this country to advise  and consult upon fish preservation work in the UnitedKingdom;  and many oversea research workers and experts have come to the  United Kingdom to study the latest developments of scientific research in our own Institutions.     8.  Most  of these examples are drawn  from the experience of the Empire Marketing Board, and  in many cases it is the funds ofthat body that have found  the necessary  finance.  Nevertheless, they are  true  products  of  the spirit of  Imperial  economic co-. operation.     9.  Even more significant, owing to the nature of its machinery and organisation, is the Executive Council for the Imperial Agri- cultural Bureaux.   This body was established in  1928 and started to function in  1929.   It  was the outcome of  the Imperial Agri- cultural Besearch Conference of 1927, and it embodies in a striking way the idea of co-operation on  the basis  of full equality.  The Executive  Council  has  created  and  administers  eight  Imperial Bureaux or clearing-houses for the collection and dissemination of information       fferent fields  of  agricultural  research.   The Chairman is the  Secretary  of the Department of Agriculture for
Scotland; England and Wales are represented by the Secretary of.the Ministry of  Agriculture and  Fisheries;  and Canada by  Dr.Grisdale,  Deputy Minister of Agriculture at Ottawa.   The Council.administers a fund of twenty thousand pounds per annum jointlycontributed in proportionate shares by the different Governments-Financial control  is thus vested in the Council, and  the  british parliament and Treasury have no greater share of control than the parliaments  and  Treasuries  of  the Dominions.   The  Councilappoints its  own  Secretary and the chief officers of  the various-Bureaux.   The methods adopted for organising and  financing theExecutive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux recall thosein use for the Imperial War Graves Commission, and suggest a.possible model for the building-up  of the machinery  of Imperialeconomic co-operation in other directions.   10.  Compared with these  achievements  in  the  field  of agri-cultural research, progress in other spheres of economic co-operation.has been less striking.  Much of it owes little or nothing to consciousorganisation, and little attention has been paid to the  constitutional machinery of such co-operation.  Nonetheless, progress has beenreal.  In addition to the two Imperial Committees and  the empire marketing Board  already mentioned, reference may be made to the mechanical Transport Council, the Standing Committee on EmpireForestry,   intra-Imperial  Conferences  on  Education, Forestry,Statistics,  Communications, the latter the parent of  Imperial  and international Communications,  Limited,  an Imperial public utilitycompany under partial  control, through  the Imperial Communica-tions  Advisory Committee, of all the Governments of the Empire.The  British Cotton Growing Association, the British Engineering-Standards  Association, and other bodies may  also  be cited asillustrative of the way in which the habit of Imperial economic-co-operation is being fostered.   So also  may  the  increasing inter-change within the Empire of knowledge and experience in the field of social, medical, public health, educational services,  &amp;c, or again,the visits  to the  Dominions of  the British  Association and  the-Empire Mining and Metallurgical Conference.   Though confined tothe Colonial Empire, the Colonial Development Fund is an example of effort directed  towards Imperial financial co-operation and  the-conscious  direction of Imperial  capital into Imperial channels.   11.  How far  the  coming Conference may be willing to givebody  to  the conception of Imperial co-operation depends on  anumber of unknown factors.   The  question  cannot  be answered,explicitly  till the Conference meets.  But it  is desirable that  theBritish Government should form in advance  a clear  idea  of what should be ideally  sought and what should be practicably attempted.   12.  The first need is to invite the attention of the conference to the question of the machinery of economic co-operation, and to lay before it a picture of the co-operation which has been achieved.and  is being, and might be,  attempted in the  various fields, inscientific  agricultural  research,  in industrial   co-operation,  in financial co-operation,  in the field of social services,  public health services, films  and broadcasting,  communications, statistics,  andso on.   18.  Such a  survey would  forcibly  suggest  the  need for co-ordinating machinery.   Would it be too ambitious to set before theConference as an  ultimate ideal the organisation  of a body repre-sentative of all members of the Empire to deliberate and advise onall economic questions which do not raise major political issues, to-which would be  affiliated existing  bodies such  as  the imperial shipping  Committee,   the  Imperial  Economic  Committee,  theExecutive Council for the Agricultural Bureaux, and any new bodieshereafter brought into being to forward economic co-operation?   14.  In the creation of such a body the experience and methodsof Geneva  would  be of great value.  It should  be appointed and insome degree financially supported by  all  the Empire Governments.It would imply a permanent staff controlled by  a Conference orCouncil meeting  at not too infrequent  intervals.  Such meetingsshould nowadays  not be impossible to  arrange.  Each  autumnMinisters  and other high representatives of the Dominion Govern-    [21158-7]                                        B 2
:ments meet in the Assembly of the League of Nations at  Geneva.Most,  if not all, of them visit London on their way to  or  from geneva.  It should not be difficult to arrange for them to meet inCouncil in London either immediately before or after the Assemblyof the League.  In practice Dominion Governments, provided theirequal authority be recognised, do not object to London as the venueof  intra-Imperial  meetings.  But it should  also be feasible foroccasional meetings  to  be held in Canada  or Australia.   Thepermanent  staff  should  include  officers   from  the  OverseasDominions, and its  officers should travel about the Empire in pursuit of  its  investigations.   The possible  scope  and  precisefunctions of the proposed body would need careful thought;  sometentative  suggestions  are put  forward  in  the  Appendix.  .    15.  It  is  possible that the  Imperial  Conference,  while not ready to  endorse  the idea  of such an  organisation, might yet beready to  have the practical possibilities of  economic co-operationexplored without prejudice to ultimate action.  In that case it mightbe arranged for the  subject to be studied (e.g., by  the  ImperialEconomic Committee) in the light of the indications given at theConference of what the traffic will bear, and a report prepared upon it for  consideration by a special gathering in London of Ministersattending the Assembly at Geneva in 1931, or, if that course shouldbe unacceptable, by the next Imperial Conference.    16.  There is one further aspect of Imperial economic co-opera-tion  which,  while raising  some delicate  constitutional questions,is yet of great importance and deserves exploration.  If the BritishEmpire is to become in any true, sense an  economic family, theColonial  Empire  must  not be ignored, and  the Dominions andIndia must be brought  into closer relationship with the Colonies.The world is becoming increasingly dependent on tropical products,-and the Dominions are beginning to recognise  the  importance  to themselves of the economic  development of the tropical portions-of the Empire.   Some  of them are directly responsible for the administration  of dependent  territories  presenting human and-economic problems similar to those of the Colonial Empire of  GreatBritain.  In the case of  Nauru, Britain,  Australia and New Zealand are already  jointly administering  a tropical  island.  Would it bepossible at the  coming Conference to  extend to the Dominions an invitation, which they would surely appreciate,  to co-operate with Great Britain in the economic development of the Colonial Empire and to combine in studying both the constitutional and the practical problems which such co-operation involves?                          APPENDIX.Suggestions as to  Scope and Functions  of an  Imperial  Economic                            Body.   1.  THE Body would be set up by the Imperial Conference andwould derive its authority  from the Governments of the Empire.The  United Kingdom, Dominions,  India and the Colonial Empirewould each be represented by  one delegate  each.   (The colonial empire  being represented  by  the Secretary  of  State  for  theColonies.)   2.  The  Body  would  administer  a  common   fund  jointlycontributed in proportionate  shares on the lines  adopted for  theCouncil of Imperial Agricultural Bureaux.  It would appoint its ownSecretary   and  staff,  which  would  include  officers   from  theDominions.   8.  In  general, its functions might  be defined as  being  todeliberate  and advise upon questions  affecting the  economic and social well-being  of  the Empire  and  to  promote  efficiency  in production and marketing, (a) by  the development of  a commonservice of  economic intelligence and investigation, and  (b)  by  the&apos;promotion  of  co-operation in the application and dissemination of-the results of  scientific research.
   4.  Experience alone can show how widely  the ultimate scopeof such a body should extend.  It is best to visualise  only the first stage in  the  development of  its  functions,  beginning with  aminimum programme,  which would involve  the least change in existing arrangements,  leaving for future  consideration any moreambitious programme which might not at first be practicable.   5.  To begin with it would merely assume  responsibility  for thework of the four  existing inter-Imperial bodies,  viz. :        (1) The Imperial Economic Committee,,       (2) The Imperial Shipping Committee,       (3) The Council  for  Imperial  Agricultural Bureaux, and       (4) The Mechanical  Transport Council.   6.  The work of  the Imperial Economic  Committee  would bere-organised under the direction of the new body and the limitationof its economic investigations to the  marketing of Empire products in the United Kingdom would be removed.  The  new body would beempowered (subject, of course, to  the instructions delegates receivedfrom their  own  Governments) to  direct  its  officers  to  conducteconomic  investigations,   prepare  documentation  and  promotecommon action on any matter affecting production and trade in theEmpire.   Instead of a standing  Economic Committee, or in additionto it, technical committees  would be appointed for special purposes and  official correspondents would  be appointed  in the Dominions.   7.  The work of the proposed  organisation would  thus include,among other matters :    (a) Surveys of particular trades or branches of production in the          Empire in relation to the  world  market (on the lines of          the existing surveys of the  Imperial Economic Committee,          but with  the  restriction of the United  Kingdom as the          only market removed) ;   (b) Special enquiries into practical problems of common interest,          e.g., standardisation  of  engineering practice,  hydro-          electric  development,   geophysical  surveying,   aerial          surveys,  soil  surveys,  the  technique of  co-operative          marketing,  rationalisation, &amp;c.;   (c) The  organisation  of a  Bureau  of  Agricultural  Market          Intelligence on a co-operative basis  for the Empire (crop          and  market reports from  Empire and foreign  countries          and periodical surveys of production and consumption) to          supplement the  work  of  the  International Institute of          Agriculture at Rome and  the Bureau of Agriculture at          Washington ;   (d) Possibly the establishment of  a clearing house of information          on trade openings for Empire industries based  on inter-          change of information between Departments of Overseas          Trade and Commerce in the Empire.  (This would repre-          sent the Empire  Trade Information  Bureau suggested by          the Association of British  Chambers of Commerce);   (e) Possibly also the promotion of expert study and authoritative          reports on  development schemes,  openings  for  capital          investment, and  applications for  loans by public authori-          ties. (This suggestion  is based on Sir Robert Hadfield&apos;s          proposed  Empire Development  Board, which appears,          however,  too  ambitious at this stage);   (/)  Questions  affecting  shipping,  which would continue to be          dealt with by the Imperial Shipping Committee;   (g) Responsibility  for the  administration  of the  Mechanical          Transport   Council,  which now  has  a joint  fund for          conducting  experiments with  new  types of  mechanical          transport;   (h) Responsibility for the administration of the  common  fund          of   20,000 per annum  for the maintenance of Imperial          Agricultural Bureaux.   8.  No specific reference has yet  been made to the co-ordination and  publication  of Empire  statistics.   After  the next  ImperialConference there is to be a Conference of Empire  statisticians,
which may lead to the setting-up of an Imperial Statistical Bureau..If so, the responsibility for its establishment and maintenance would.rest  with  the proposed body.   9.  The cost of the minimum  programme set  out above, over-and  above the present expenditure of the Council for  ImperialBureaux and the  Mechanical Transport Council, may be  estimatedat not  more than  ^80,000 per annum.   The  share of the UnitedKingdom in this figure would be about  5,000 and that of Canadamight be the same.   10.  If the Dominions agreed  to come into a scheme on theabove lines, or even on more restricted lines, it is for consideration whether the United Kingdom  might  not offer at  a later stage to-hand over  to  the proposed  Council  full responsibility for the-administration of  the Imperial Institute without any increased costto the Dominions beyond their present contributions to that body.Both the  Mineral Resources  Bureau of  that Institute  and thetechnical  services concerned  with  raw  materials are,  in  fact,designed to serve the interests of the overseas Empire, but owingto considerations of status  and  finance, some of the Dominions takelittle interest in it as  at present organised.   11.  Finally, it has been suggested that part, at any rate, ofthe work of the Empire Marketing Board might be transferred to-the new Imperial  body, if the home Government were willing tomake over part of the money now  voted for Empire marketing for-purposes of general Empire development.
CONFIDENTIAL.                          APPENDIX M.INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF  COMMERCE     BRITISH NATIONAL COMMITTEESOME  CONSIDERATIONS OF  THE   UNITED STATES OF  EUROPE                  and        OTHER  POSSIBLE        ECONOMIC GROUPSAn Independent Study prepared for the information and Consideration of the British National Committee.Office of the British National Committee,14, Queen Anne&apos;s Gate, London, S.W.1,ylh February, 1930.
Some   considerations  of   the  United  States  ofEurope  and  other   possible   Economic  Groups.    Monsieur BriancTs invitation at Geneva in September to the delegates of certain countries to consider whether among  &quot; peoples constituting geo-graphical groups like  the  peoples of Europe there should be some kind of federal bond/&apos; was made at a time when European Powers were exceedinglyapprehensive about the proposed new American tariff which if  carried intoeffect was calculated to restrict their imports into  that country yet further and to aggravate the burden of their debts.   Both before and after MonsieurBriand&apos;s speech there were many suggestions that European nations shouldcombine to protest against, and if necessary to combat, the introduction ofthe American tariff.  Alternatively  they were invited in various  quartersto bring combined pressure on the United States of America after the tariffhad been introduced,  for the purpose of relaxing its provisions vis-a-vis thegroup of protesting Powers.  The launching of a proposal to create what was almost immediately termed the &quot; United States of Europe &quot; therefore occurred at a moment when the thought uppermost in many peoples&apos; minds was how to resist American economic domination, and this, in  spite of the warningsuttered  by supporters of the scheme that no antagonism towards Americawas intended.    Monsieur Briand was careful not to suggest that a  grouping of european powers  &quot; to  establish  among  themselves  a bond  of  solidarity  which  willenable them, if need be, to meet any grave emergency &quot; had any political or even economic significance.  Various  writers and speakers on the subjectsince  September  have in consequence  of  this  vagueness interpreted  the invitation  in various ways, though  all of them, including Monsieur Briand,have postulated that some federal link, whatever its object, in Europe mustnot impair the sovereignty of any of the nations belonging to the association.It has generally and rightly been assumed that the objective of such groupingmust  have an economic raison  d&apos;etre and  particularly  be concerned withcustoms tariffs.  It will, nevertheless,  be well to  bear in mind that if a federation of Powers in Europe occur in some form it can still  have usefulfunctions, which, though directly  concerned with the  furtherance of  trade,need not involve a common customs policy and may indeed be quite distinct.But that the suggestions made  by Monsieur  Briand were intended to have aneconomic complexion is borne out by the season he chose in which to speak.The people who repudiated any intention on the part of Monsieur Briand to propose a  scheme antagonistic to the United States of America were withsome  justification able to  suggest  that  the grouping of consumption unitsinto larger  entities could scarcely fail to benefit the export trade of  north america if tariffs remained unchanged towards that country, even  though they were reduced as between individual units.  They also can point to somebody of opinion which is in favour  of allowing a European Group to admitnon-European units.  At the  same time it is scarcely  conceivable how  a european tariff grouping, for such is after all what the  general public rightlyhas in mind  in this connection, can so be formed as even to  admit  thepossibility of the inclusion of the United  States  of America or, owing to theirincompatibility of interests, South American and semi-colonial countries.    It is rather significant that more or less simultaneously Mr.  WilliamGraham suggested what has since come to be known as the &quot; Tariff Truce,&quot;a project which, while it was  not  at the time directly connected with the
United States of Europe Idea, is said to have originated out of a considerationof practical means of achieving such an object.   The attitude which we shouldtake up in this country towards the United States of Europe and the TariffTruce requires  to be carefully  considered both qua people of Great Britainand qua members of the British Commonwealth.    Means of achieving some form of federation,  which for lack of a bettername can be called the United States of Europe, have already been suggestedin various quarters.   The  schemes range from autonomous  co-operation tomultilateral treaties, with  objects  varying  from the unification of weights and measures,  the creation of an international post and telegiaph system,the standardisation  of railways and customs  tariffs throughout Europe,  onthe one hand, to the grouping of two or more  countries into &quot; tariff islands &quot;with a view to  enlarge the size of European producing and trading units,on  the other.  These units, in passing, number 28 counting Russia as one,Danzig and the Irish Free State as separate units, and Iceland as part of denmark.    Though not the first by any means, one of the most interesting of these schemes  was the suggestion of forming &quot; tariff  islands,&quot;  put forward  byMonsieur  de Peyerimhoff  in the  course of an address which he  gave in brussels  at  the end of October.  Monsieur de  Peyerimhoff is President ofthe Central Mining  Committee of France.   His suggestion that european countries  should group  themselves in  &quot; tariff islands &quot;  surrounded by acommon  tariff wall according to their economic relations, is one which mightwell have been expected to emanate from a person intimately  associatedwith coal mining and consequently with steel and iron production  on theContinent.  The obvious grouping which he had in mind is France, Belgium,Luxemburg,  Germany and Switzerland.  Monsieur de Peyerimhoff&apos;s theoryat best seems to be that by  creating a natural economic group and surroundingit with a common customs tariff, the way would be more readily cleared  forgroups to join each other and thus finally to create a European entity, than would occur if  a large artificially organised  group were to  start the ball.There are, however, good  reasons for thinking  that  the creation of  severalgroups with  rival interests  might indefinitely  postpone the creation of aPan-European  entity.  In  this country we  should certainly regard  withapprehension the creation  of a group or groups directed  towards fosteringcertain industries, which owing to  our own  peculiar industrial  position inEurope would  almost inevitably  be directed against  ourselves.   Monsieurde  PeyerimhofPs suggestion reflects the French school of thought which islooking for a solution to European economic difficulties rather by the creationof industrial cartels and the consequent rationing or specialisation of pro-duction and  markets by type  and direction.  This thesis  is one which willcommend itself with difficulty to our British view, partly on account of ourinnate distrust  of international cartels and partly owing to our own lack of sufficient organisation to enable us to participate in them.    Monsieur de Peyerimhoff&apos;s suggestion of grouping countries into &quot; tariffislands&quot;  smacks of  an attempted compromise between the United States ofEurope Idea and the French Cartel Thesis ; he seems to have had the latterin mind when he was talking of the former.  The political consequences of dividing  Europe into &quot; tariff islands &quot;  would be of extreme  gravity.   It isidle to suggest  that  any economic or customs grouping is devoid of politicalcomplication.   The matter is one purely of degree ;  at one end of the scaleare &quot; Zollvereins &quot;  which  where they  have  existed have  always  led  to serious political developments.  At  the  other end of the &apos;scale are customsgroupings (other than bilateral treaties), the political consequences of which
must vary with the tightness of the connection.  At neither end of the scalecan  it  be said that political implications do not  exist ;  supporters of theUnited States of Europe  Idea  are, perhaps suspiciously, anxious to disarmcriticism on these lines by asserting that no form of &quot; Zollverein &quot; is intendedand  that  there is  all the  difference in the world between unity of customstariffs among  two or more countries and tariff groupings  using reciprocalconcessions  within  the  group but inapplicable, by a group, to units outsideit.   But  the nature of this difference is a matter of opinion.    The permanent staff of the League of Nations has been considering means by which the United States of Europe Idea and other tariff groupings mightbe achieved ;  other bodies have  also given  their thoughts  to  the matter.The Austrian section of the International Chamber of Commerce has prepared a draft of &quot; Guiding Principles &quot; for the direction of an International Con-ference which should be called to consider commercial relations in Europe.Two aspects have already emerged, two antagonistic aspects which may be termed the European view and the World view.    Some force is clearly apparent in the criticism  which extra-european powers have already directed at the League of Nations, that that organisation is tending to become a machine for maintaining European domination in theworld, or alternatively that  it is  principally  directed towards safeguarding the interests of Europe without regard to, or even at the expense of, extra-European Powers.  The  creation,  around Monsieur  Briand&apos;s  ideas, of a european and a  World antithesis brings us up sharply before the questionof considering whether our own interests lie on the Continent or further afield.Advocacy of the  European Union Thesis, while not excluding the  formationof similar groups  elsewhere, may seriously compromise the League of nations in the eyes of the American Continents.    Consideration  of  the United  States of  Europe Idea  is  particularlyopportune at a time when the subject of Empire Free Trade is  to the fore.Various people presumably have quite different ideas of what is  meant by&quot; Empire Free Trade &quot; or they would not display such unanimity in theirPress pronouncements.  In the literal sense of the word, Empire  Free Trade,both  for economic and political reasons, seems an unattainable goal.  Butif the only thing we mean is &quot; freer Empire trade &quot; and some sort of commonImperial economic policy, the subject assumes a less controversial and amore  practical  aspect.  The  interpretation  also  avoids the necessity  of considering  at  this stage the probabilities or possibilities of, for instance,Australia agreeing to  a  reduction  of her tariffs in favour of Great britain for some hypothetical advantages which  we may  procure in  favour  ofAustralia, either in this country or by intervention in, for example, Canada.If it  is intended that the Dominions and we ourselves  adopt an economic policy  which,  while  possibly  entailing individual  sacrifice, will  involveconsideration of the needs and interests of individual members of the BritishCommonwealth, we should probably all be agreed on its desirability, whetheror not there is any practical outcome.   Financially it cannot be forgotten that while the export trade of this country has increased in the  direction ofthe Empire and decreased in the direction of Europe during the last 15 years,the aggregate trade, import  and export, of this country with the  Empire isstill only 32 per cent, of the whole.

In considering the United States of Europe Idea, not  only  our exporttrade but also our imports need to be taken into account, both for purposesof comparing our position vis-a-vis  Europe  as  against our position in  theworld generally, and also because an influential economic unit such as europe would have a direct influence on our imports.                            ^                            sjc    The difficulties which  confront us in a decision whether to concentrateupon an imperial  economic policy or upon the organisation of a United Statesof Europe have been apparent to those bodies which in Europe  have given their consideration to the latter during the last four months.  They are allaware, as we must be, of the difficulties in which we are situated as part ofthe British Empire in making common cause with European countries engagedin creating a European customs block.  Not only are these difficulties apparent,but we  are  beset by the further problem of what we, having virtually nocustoms  tariff, can  offer to  European  Powers  in an  endeavour to  induce them to lower theirs with a view to facilitating our trade.  We have, crudelyspeaking, nothing to offer in the way of tariff advantages in this countryremotely  comparable to the  advantages we should obtain by  securing  areduction of tariffs in a large  European  Group.  To impose tariffs at thisstage solely to have a bargaining weapon would be a retrograde  step whichthe public would rightly never countenance  and which recent experience in central Europe has done nothing to make popular.  To threaten to imposetariffs, or contrarily to sell our freedom of action by an obligation not to doso, seem to be in  the same  category.   We should therefore, at all costs, avoidbeing placed in the position  of having to negotiate with a European Group,the members of  which had already decided among themselves  to adopt  acommon economic policy of more or less internal free or freer trade.     We can therefore now consider the most concrete scheme hitherto  put up in connection with  the United  States of Europe  Idea.  On this planmembers of the  group will adopt what may for convenience be known asinterior  and exterior tariffs,  the former operative between  members of  thegroup, the  latter imposed by members of the group against nations which
are  not members.  The  practical difficulties of  starting a  group  will  beconsidered  later  in  connection  with  &quot; Most Favoured Nation&quot;  treaties.Supposing a group, for the sake of argument, of France, Belgium, Switzerlandand Italy negotiated  a common tariff policy  on the lines indicated ;  thereare only few advantages  which the group could obtain  by admitting  GreatBritain, since trade  from countries to  Great Britain is already fairly freeexcept  as regards certain specific commodities interesting individual countries and not  the whole  union.   A fortiori, admission to the  group would  beproportionately more  difficult as it  grew larger.  Our  only chance wouldappear  to be either  to create a rival European Group, which for political reasons would be most undesirable, or  contrive by taking the initiative atthis stage to be in at the  start.*     The  consideration needs qualifying in  two  ways.   It  is  conceivable that the membership of Great Britain would be valuable if we  consented toimpose  tariffs against non-member nations, or alternatively if by coming inourselves we could bring  in with us Dominions  which do possess high tariffwalls. EconomicaUy the former  alternative would presumably involve us indiscriminatory tariffs,  for instance, against America, since the  admission ofthe United States of America into a European tariff group is, per se, incon-ceivable.   The  latter  alternative presents  almost insuperable  economic difficulties,  owing to  incompatibility  of interests and type  of commercialactivity.     The British Dominions and Colonies being among the principal producers of raw  material in the world,  if united by a common economic policy would obviously be in  a position  to exercise  immense bargaining power withoutactually participating  as  a group in any other customs association.  while this is a source of strength, it is also  a source of grave danger, as has been pointed out since the early days of the Tariff Reform and Imperial Preferencecampaign.  Any attempt on the part of the British Empire to use its resources in raw  material as a club wherewith  to beat  another association of powers would certainly provide a good and perhaps a reasonable excuse for the restof the world to combine  against the British  Empire.  Use of the threat orhard bargaining on this basis  is probably the  surest way at present open to start another war.  After  all, our raw materials are prime necessities to manyfor mere  existence :  their curtailment  might easily mean deprivation andstarvation to which, in the last resort, war as  an act of the desire to surviveis the only reaction.     Equally the creation of three customs groups, namely, the United Statesof America, the United States of  Europe and  the British Empire, could leadto grave political complications if they took the form of separate competingentities.  Such an organisation would probably have a  disastrous effect  onthe peace of the world. On the other hand, as three co-operating units theycould certainly achieve constructive economies,  and therefore sanity in customspolicy.    * It is fair to add that some of the promoters of the movement have betrayed anxietynot to proceed without British collaboration and have suggested that Great Britain be offeredfull reciprocity on condition        (A) That British duties are not raised on those commodities which are the subject of    the agreement which may only deal with a limited number of commodities ;  or       (B) That Great Britain  give  reciprocal treatment, that is to say, do not raise her    customs duties above the level to which the parties to the agreement have reduced their    tariffs.
     This brings us back to the idea referred to at the beginning of the memo-randum  as  suggested by Monsieur de Peyerimhoff, namely,  the  creation of tariff islands.   If  such  groupings can be achieved on a world wide scale, onthat scale alone and not on an intra-European basis the project becomesfeasible and attractive.     The relative sizes of the three units are worth restating :      United States of America       ...     ...    121 million inhabitants     United States of Europe ...     ...     ...    323    ,,        ,,         (excluding Great Britain)     British Empire    ...     ...     ...     ...    477     The World...  &apos;............   1,975The figures suggest that  we are not making the most of our opportunities,even without  being led into adopting a policy  antagonistic both to europe and America.     In considering the situation, India must be regarded  as a  Dominion,while British Crown Colonies, for legal and economic reasons,  must be dealtwith separately both vis-a-vis the United  States of Europe and an imperialeconomic policy,  the position of  each colony being decided  upon its  own merits and in accordance with where its interests lie.  The difficulty of thecolonial problem has been apparent to all  those  who  have  gone into thequestion  at all ;  it of  course applies to French and other  colonies Mutatis Mutandis as well as to ours.     If the difficulties  which beset the questions hitherto covered, namely,the United  States of Europe Idea and  Empire Free Trade  (or freer tradewithin the Empire)  are admitted,  there will be no disputing the followingdicta :          (1) that we are not prepared to abandon  our imperial interests for     the sake of the  United States  of Europe ;         (2) that we cannot afford, in view  of the volume of trade which     this  country does  with Europe, to. be left out of any discussions about     European tariff grouping from the very  beginning ;         (3) that neither  qua  Great Britain  nor qua British Empire can we     afford to be placed in a position of antagonism to the United States of    America by assuming obligations to impose  discriminatory tariffs against     that or indeed any other country.     On the other hand the following positive points will probably also beagreed :          (A) that  all reductions of tariffs, whether in Europe or  elsewhere    in the world,  cannot  but be advantageous to us, unless they are bought     on conditions which  involve us in difficulties ;         (B) that  Imperial Co-operation  will provide  a bargaining lever,     though a  dangerous  one for us,  in connection  with  any   European     groupings ;         (c) that,  although we bicker with  the United States of America,     our  interests  on balance  undoubtedly lie  more in  the  direction of a     common policy with the Americans  rather  than  joining hands with    Europe to combat them and  possibly to estrange  the Dominions.
     Before drawing up a programme of desiderata for guidance or use in aninternational discussion on the United States of Europe, it will be necessaryto consider as more immediate the line to be taken on Mr. Graham&apos;s proposalfor a tariff truce.   Although various schemes for a United States of Europehave been propounded in different quarters, none have yet reached the stage of being placed on Agenda for discussion by an official body or by Govern-ments.   The Tariff Truce proposal  is  far more immediate inasmuch as theLeague of Nations has already  circulated a Paper entitled &quot; international conference for the Conclusion of a Tariff Truce,&quot; enclosing a draft convention,and has obtained answers from a suitable number of Governments that theywere prepared to discuss  the subject in the near future.  Whether this pro-posal be regarded  as a first step leading towards some concrete suggestion inconnection with the United States of Europe, or whether a Tariff  Truce shallstand alone and  be carried  into  effect without ulterior connection  withMonsieur Briand&apos;s invitation,  the subject is  sufficiently relevant  here forinterested  parties to consider.     A Tariff Truce involves for a term of years the stabilisation  of existingtariffs, the modification of which is  after all the aim to which our attention is directed. Whatever view we may take about the United States of europe and more  especially if it  is thought that some good may come of MonsieurBriand&apos;s invitation, it seems fairly clear that the convention for a TariffTruce should rather be directed  towards  laying down the principle that fora term of years in  any future tariffs agreement between countries, negotiationshould be on the basis of decreases.   The preamble of the document circulatedby the League of Nations on the subject of the Tariff Truce refers to concerted action &quot; not to increase   .  .  . protective tariffs above the present  level&quot; for a period of from two to three years, or to impose new protective duties&quot;or create new impediments to trade.&quot;  The  draft convention, however,proposes that contracting parties shall not raise  their  tariffs which, even ifit is legally held not  to preclude them from being lowered,  is scarcely suffi-ciently clear for the common herd not to  misinterpret the intention.  In any event, if tariffs for a term of years are, by the agreement of a large block ofconsenting nations, stabilised, it will not  only postpone or make the negotia-tions of a European Group with a common  customs policy more difficult, butif several members of the British Commonwealth acceded to such a  conventionmight even block the way for working out a programme between  themselves of freer Empire trade.  Moreover the consolidation of tariffs on their present levels for a term of years would  be  of the greatest possible assistance to our competitors by ensuring stable conditions  in the place of uncertainty for  their production programmes.     The actual machinery  for  negotiating a  group  tariff  convention isintimately concerned with  Most Favoured Nation Treatment, adopted inmost countries as the principle underlying their commercial agreements withother Governments.  The theory involved, of course, establishes  as betweenthe contracting parties that no third nation (sometimes with certain specifiedexceptions) shall receive  more favourable  treatment than the other partyto the treaty.  The clause has the  effect of making any concessions which one  country may particularly desire to give to  another  country effective forall  other countries which have,  with  the  first nation, commercial  treatiescontaining the Most Favoured Nation  clause.   It acts, in other words,  as a safe guard against  the imposition between countries of tariffs discriminatingagainst the goods of another country, though it is often evaded by the framing of customs regulations in  such a  manner  as to exclude  specific or  specialisedproducts by ad hoc definitions, etc.
    It is clearly impossible for a group of nations to adopt a common tariff policy, benefiting by mutual concessions and having an interior and exteriortariff scale applicable to members and non-members of the group respectively,if some of the candidates for the association are signatories of Most favoured nation commercial  agreements  with other nations  not contemplated  as members.  The only legal method of escape from this impasse is for each ofthe two or three putative members of a customs group to denounce all theirexisting  commercial treaties  containing  a Most  Favoured Nation  clause inorder to be able  to impose a dual tariff  of the nature suggested.   But the dangers  of denouncing commercial  treaties containing the clause  are suffi-ciently obvious ;  the clause being reciprocal, the other party to each treaty would be at liberty to discriminate  against the  goods of the candidate.  Totake a practical  example, supposing Great Britain,  France,  Belgium andGermany contemplated forming an economic union with a common customspolicy, though not necessarily a similar  tariff,  and each  agreed to extendcertain concessions only to the other three  and  not to the rest of the  world(but to extend them also to any other members that would come into thegroup), the first step must necessarily have to be for each of the four nations to denounce  all their  commercial agreements containing  a  Most favoured nation clause with the rest  of the  world in order to enact the legislation required by the new policy.  Inter alia, they would be obliged to denouncetheir  commercial agreements  with, for  instance, America, with  the  con-sequence that the Americans would  be entitled and perhaps even justified inimposing discriminatory tariffs to the advantage of other countries but tothe disadvantage of the four in question.    The complications appear obvious without  going  into  further detail.A  way of escape has been suggested, by which the application of  the most favoured Nation clauses should be in some form restricted by joint negotiation with other countries through  the League of Nations so that the treatmentshould remain  only insofar as it does not clash with a group tariff policy.    In view of the fact that the tariff need not  be identical but only similarbetween members of  an economic union of this  sort, the point is a difficult one to outline in  a short note.  It  has been adequately but  optimisticallydealt  with in  a communication circulated by the League of Nations.              He      *****       *    The difficulties  involved by the existence  of  Most  Favoured Nationclauses are such  as  to render  any  approach towards the United  States ofEurope a remote ideal.  It is  unlikely  to be achieved until a great deal ofspadework is  done, including the assimilation of various types of  customstariffs to each other, the unification of customs definitions and the standardisation-tion of customs treaties.  It is rather in this direction that the first approaches to a United States of Europe can best be sought.   A conference on the subject would be more usefully directed at the present  time  riot towards even thediscussion of a customs union of greater or smaller extent but to the unificationand co-ordination of customs treaties, procedure and policy.   Work is already being done on some of these lines by the League of Nations but any support which  the work can derive from Trade  Organisations would clearly speed upthe progress.    If a concrete policy  were to be laid down, it would take the line of recommending that the United States  of Europe Idea be closely examined with a view to getting out of the way, in the first place, the preparatory workwhich  will be necessary before any group customs agreements can be come to                                    8
on a large scale.  In other words, going back to the remarks which were madeat the beginning of this memorandum,  there are a great many directions inwhich the United States of Europe Idea could, without infringing sovereigntyor adopting an economic policy, prepare  the way for the latter after it hasbeen  more deeply considered.  It will be almost disingenuous for chambers of Commerce, Trade Associations and other bodies in  this  country to  add that they desire to see customs tariffs reduced in all directions but it may bepertinent to suggest that the convention which will shortly be  considered byan international  conference arising  out of  Mr. William  Graham&apos;s  proposalshall  establish the principle  that any modifications  in  tariffs for  a certainperiod of  years should be  towards reduction  and not merely  towardsstabilisation.    The next stage will probably be&apos; to set our own  house in order so as toascertain what our requirements in the way of tariffs  and economic policyreally are ; in other words, to organise  our industries and commerce in sucha way that they are vocal and representative, not vociferous and partisan,and  arising out of that to establish an  imperial economic policy  and freertrade within the Empire.    While Chambers of Commerce,  Trade Associations and other bodies may wish to express general opinions on matters discussed in the foregoing pages,in the present state of vagueness surrounding the subject they will considerit  imperative  to  ask certain specific questions before  preparing their finalviews.  It will,  for example, be desirable,  in  replying to a question &quot; Areyou in favour of the United States of Europe Idea ? &quot; to reply :  &quot; We are infavour of any idea which may  facilitate trade  and reduce customs barriers ;and we will enter into  discussion with you as soon  as we know what your proposals for a United States of Europe are, since at present  we  have not seen any.  We have heard vague ideas  :  we have seen vague proposals :  wehave been told that these have no political implications but are very doubtfulon this point because we do not know of any customs unions which have not had  political consequences.  We must  know whether your  proposals covergeneral abatement of tariffs  or reciprocal concessions for certain groups of merchandise  only.  We must  know whether  you  are  talking about  our export trade and your import  trade or vice versa or both.  We must knowwhether by a  common tariff policy you mean a policy designed to  introducean identical tariff in different countries, or parallel tariffs in various countries,and if so what equivalents  you  suggest.   We must know whether you intend to deal only with tariffs or with other commercial subjects, such as freedomfor foreigners to trade in any of the countries  members  of a possible group.We must know whether the  doctrine of &apos; Equal Opportunities &apos; in fact is tobe a  corner-stone  of the new building.   We must know,  when you ask  forour replies or  our reactions, exactly what your questions mean.  We do notthink that sufficiently specific  questions have yet been  put, whereas  we doconsider  that  general questions  and grandiloquent  titles like the &apos; UnitedStates of Europe &apos;  are exceedingly  dangerous  when  nine people out  of tenhave  nine different conceptions of the object.   But we can say now that weare not opposed to the United States  of  Europe ;  indeed we are vitallyinterested.  Only  we consider  that  a great deal more preparatory work isnecessary before we can either make suggestions  ourselves or contribute  tothose of  other people.&quot;yth February, 1930.VACHER 75563
