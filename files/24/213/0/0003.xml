RATIFICATION OF THE &quot;TARIFF T.;UCE&quot;.                   Memorandum by the president of the 3oard of Trade.                   My colleagues are aware of the conditions under which              the &quot;Tariff Truce&quot; was drawn up, and in fact sanctioned the              action I proposed in their decisions of February 12th  last              (Cabinet Conclusions 10(10) and 34(8)).                   The Commercial Convention must bo ratified before              November 1st of this year; as it  is concluded  in the first              instance for the period from April 1st, 1930 to April  1st,              1931, the observance of its undertakings even  before              ratification is evidently necessary to enable  a  country to              ratify.  I now seek Cabinet authority for  ratification.                   My previous memorandum (CP. ISO) gives a full account              of  the provisions of the Convention; but two questions              arise.                   The first may be  described  a3 a minor question.   It              has been suggested from time to  time that  such a              convention should not  be ratified save as  the  result of a              positive resolution of the House  of  Commons, though no              undertaking of any kind has been given on  behalf of  the              Government exoept  the  statement  made by  the Chancellor of              the Exchequer, speaking for the  Prime Minister,  on              February 10th  last, when he said  &quot;Papers will  be laid  in              both Houses, but  the Government  will be  guided by  the              opinion of the House of Commons&quot;.    Sir  Austen Chamberlain              subsequently stated (on April  1st) that  the opposition              would  ask for  an occasion  fc*o discuss the matter  on its
merits &quot;when we can move a motion in regard to it&quot;.   Nosuch request has been made, though general debate on thequestion has taken place on two occasions, once during theprogress of the Conference, and the second time on the Boardof Trade Vote on May 14th.  I would therefore suggest thatratification might properly be effected without further discussion.     I must, however, put to my colleagues a major questionof policy.  The Commercial Convention prevents us fromimposing new protective duties, or increasing theprotection of existing duties until April 1st, 1931, andin fact thereafter unless we first denounce the Convention.At the time when we entered on the negotiations, I assumed,as no doubt did the Cabinet in their decisions, that thiswas in accordance with the settled policy of our administration.  But I must point out that since then therehave been suggested, on more than one occasion, proposals in direct conflict with this undertaking.  Before our last meeting there was circulated a memorandum byMr. H.D. Henderson (CP. 196) suggesting an entirely differentpolicy.  Moreover, there has been discussion of various measures of direct agricultural protection.  No such measures can be introduced in the near future if weratify the Convention; and even after April 1st next, theycan only be introduced if we have given notice on or beforeFebruary let next of our intention of withdrawing from theConvention.W.G.Board of Trade,   13th June, 1930.
