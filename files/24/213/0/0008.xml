REPORT.                     I__INTRODUCTORY.           (a) Composition  and Terms of Reference.   1.  ON the 1st August,  1929, the Prime Minister appointed aSub-Committee of the Committee of Civil Research* with the follow-ing Terms of Reference :        &quot; To consider  and report upon the present condition  and   prospects of the  Cotton Industry and to make recommendations   as to any action which may appear desirable and  practicable in   order to improve the position of that Industry in the markets of   the world.&quot;   2.  The Committee is constituted as follows :    The Right Hon. J. R. Clynes, M.P., Secretary of State for Home       Affairs  (Chairman).   The Right  Hon.  A. V.   Alexander, M.P., First Lord  of  the       Admiralty.   Sir Alan Anderson, K.B.E.   Mr. Joseph Jones.   Sir William McLintock, G.B.E., C.V.O.   3.  At the time when the Committee was constituted, the Chair-man was the Right Hon. W. Graham, M.P., President of the Boardof Trade.  Owing  to the exceptionally severe Parliamentary dutiesof the President of the Board of Trade and to his necessary absence from  this  country  in connection with  the  Hague Conference,the First Lord of the Admiralty acted as Chairman until the openingof the Naval Conference, when the Right Hon.  J. R. Clynes, M.P.,Secretary of State  for Home Affairs, was appointed Chairman of theCommittee in the place of Mr. Graham.    4.  On the 2nd August,  1929,  we held a preliminary meeting for the purpose of laying down the procedure to be followed in our Inquiry.   In order to inform ourselves generally of the nature of the- problem  to be studied, we decided, in the first instance, to obtain preliminary evidence  from  the  organisations  representing  the employers in the spinning and manufacturing sections and from the organisations representing  the operatives.  We accordingly invited -the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations,  the Cotton Spinners&apos; and Manufacturers&apos;  Association and the United Textile Factory  Workers&apos;  Association  to give  evidence  before  us.  After receiving evidence  from these bodies, we devoted a series  of sessions to hearing evidence in respect of the other sections of the industry. The  Merchanting  system  was explained  to us  by the Shipping Merchants&apos;  Committee of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce. For the finishing trades,  evidence was submitted by the  Federation of Calico Printers, the Piece Dyers&apos; Association and the Bleaching Trade Advisory Board.  Evidence regarding the  method by which Lancashire  obtains its raw cotton  supplies was  furnished by the Liverpool  Cotton   Association  and  by  the  Manchester  Cotton Association.    5.  We  also  received evidence from  the Lancashire Cotton Cor- poration, the recently formed amalgamation in the spinning section    * Note. By  Treasury Minute dated January 27, 1930, the Committee of Civil Research was absorbed in the Economic  Advisory Council, of which&quot; this Sub-Committee became a Committee.Mr. A. F.

of the industry.   Evidence was also submitted by the Association ofCotton Mill Directors.   6.  At the conclusion of  this part of our  Inquiry, we  receivedgeneral evidence  on  matters of interest to all  parts of the  industry from the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations, which was established some  years ago under the auspices of  the ManchesterChamber  of  Commerce and  consists of leading  representatives ofSpinners, Manufacturers,  Finishers,  Merchants and  Operatives.The  Joint Committee also  furnished  us with a large amount ofinteresting  statistics prepared  by  the Cotton  Trade  StatisticalBureau.   7.  At an early  stage of our Inquiry we  thought it proper to consult with the  joint stock banks  chiefly interested  in the  cottonindustry, namely, the District Bank, the Union Bank of Manchester,the Midland Bank  and  Williams  Deacon&apos;s  Bank,  in regard tothe financial prospects of the industry.  In  addition,  the governor of the Bank of England, at our request, gave evidence before us onthis subject.   8.  Finally,  we  received evidence  on  various  aspects of our inquiry from a number of leading members of  the industry.   9.  We held twenty-one meetings for the purpose of taking oral evidence.  A list  of  the witnesses is given in  the Appendix to thisReport.  In addition, we were furnished with memoranda on  par-ticular points by  the Board of Trade.  Written  evidence was alsosubmitted to us by the British Cotton Industry  Research  Associa-tion,   the  British  Cotton  Growing  Association,  the  EmpireCotton  Growing   Corporation,  the  Finishers&apos;  Association  andthe Amalgamated  Society  of Dyers,  Bleachers,  Finishers  andKindred Trades.   We also received from various  sources a largenumber of other  written communications.   10.  We  desire to place on record our indebtedness to all whohave assisted us  in  our Inquiry, whether by giving  oral evidence before  us or by  furnishing memoranda.                   (c)  Arrangement of Report.   11.  In preparing our Report, we have not thought it necessaryto survey in any detail the history  of  the   development of theLancashire cotton industry.  We have, however, briefly compared(Section II) the position of the industry in 1914 with  that in whichit finds itself placed to-day  and have  given  some account  of theincrease  of  foreign  competition which has   led  to  the  presentposition.  Section III is devoted  to a description of the present organisation of the several sections of the industry.  In Section IV,we discuss the need  for technical re-equipment in the spinning and manufacturing sections.  In Section V, we consider possible  meansof securing  closer co-operation between employers and operativeson questions of common interest.  In Section VI,  we refer to  recentmovements within the industry towards amalgamations and indicateonr views on the need for  re-organisation.   Section VII  containsour conclusions,  and Section VIII our recommendations.     II.-COMPARISON OF  PRE-WAR AND PRESENT        CONDITION  OF  THE  COTTON  INDUSTRY.                      (a)  Position in 1914.   12.  From  1900  to 1914, the  Lancashire  cotton  industrydeveloped rapidly.   The retained imports of raw  cotton  rose  by nearly  one-third, the number  of spindles by over one-third, andthe number  of  looms  by  one-fourth.   The number  of  personsemployed increased substantially.  The yardage of  cotton piece-goods exported also increased by a quarter.  If the United Statesbe excluded in each case, about half  the world&apos;s spindles and halfthe world&apos;s looms  immediately before the  war were situated  in
this country and in spite of the fact that, on the whole, Lancashirespun  finer yarns  than other countries a quarter of the  cottonconsumption took  place  in this country.  Of the  export trade ofthe world in cotton piece-goods, Lancashire  held, by  value, about two-thirds.  On the eve of the  war, therefore, the British  cottonindustry was larger  in every respect than at any  previous  periodof its history and held a predominant position in  the markets ofthe world.                      (b) Position in 1930.   13.  During  the   war   manufacture   was   interrupted  inLancashire   and  some  of   our   chief  rivals   were  free  todevelop   their   factories  and  capture   our   foreign   trade.Immediately after  the  war  there  occurred,  in  1919-20,  a brief period of boom, but on  its collapse a period of depression set in and  has  continued  to  the  present day.  Before the war, therehad, from time  to time,  been periods of depression in the  cottonindustry,  but these were due to passing causes  and  were usuallycomparatively short.   The  industry was strong enough to  take them  in  its  stride.    The  present   depression   has  been ofunexampled  duration  and gravity.   The  world consumption ofcotton  piece-goods    appears  to  have  actually  risen,  butthe   yardage  of  such   goods  exported  from   this   countryis now  less  than   two-thirds  of  what  it   was  in  1910-13.Still  more  ominous  is  the  fact  that  this  decline  in  trade has  not  been   arrested.   The  main  losses  so  far have  beensuffered in the  coarse  standard lines which form a very important part of the whole trade.   Prom  these Lancashire has  already been largely  ousted,  and the  stress  of competition is  now extendingalso  to medium  goods.  In high class goods, Lancashire still holdsher own, but it  can only be a matter of time before Lancashire mayhave to withstand an attack even in her own high class specialities.   14.  We understand that  it  is not possible to make any exactcalculation  of  the course of the  home  consumption of  Britishpiece-goods, but that the results of the Census  of Production takenin respect of 1912 and that for 1924  indicate that  while home consumption fell between  these two years, the decline was less thanthat in exports.   It has  been estimated  that the proportion  of theoutput  of  piece-goods  that  was consumed  in this  country  was probably in the  neighbourhood of 22 per cent,  in 1912 and  25 percent, in 1924.   15.  In the following table, we give particulars of the exports ofyarn, of grey cloth, and of bleached, printed and dyed piece-goodsin recent  years, together  with the corresponding figures  for 1913.These figures show,  in the most striking manner,  how widespreadhas been  the fall in the various classes of cotton exports  since thewar  and, in particular,  how grave it  has been  in grey  cloth.The  exports of  the latter, which amounted to  2,357,492  thousandlinear yards in 1913, had fallen  to 1,402,275 thousand linear yardsin 1924.  They  have since declined continuously, and,  in 1929, fell to 954,823 thousand linear yards.

               (o) The Egyptian Spinning Section.    16.  Lancashire  has retained  its pre-eminence in the highestclass of cotton piece-goods, and the same is true of the finest yarns,spun  mainly from Egyptian cotton.  These  yarns are  made  by awell-defined section of the spinning industry, and the firms in the&apos;&apos; Egyptian&apos;&apos;  spinning section remained prosperous until the lasttwo or three  years.  The  yarn of coarse and medium counts made from American cotton is almost entirely used in further manufactureat home,  but  a  great  part  of the  fine yarn is exported to theContinent.  The recent difficulties of the Egyptian spinners are due,in part, to a shrinkage in the demand from this source.  these difficulties have,  however, been greatly  aggravated by  excessivecompetition  between the  various Egyptian  spinning  companies.There  have  for  some time been  several  large amalgamationsin this  section, and further progress has  recently been made inthe same  direction.  The position  in  this  section is  essentiallydifferent from that  in the  much larger  &apos;&apos; American&apos;&apos;  spinningsection, where the problem  is foreign, not  internal, competition.It is with  the &quot; American &quot;  section  that we  are  mainly concernedin this Report.                 (d) Increase of Foreign Competition.      17.   The manufacturing countries which have made the greatest  inroads into Lancashire&apos;s export trade are those in the Far East,  namely, India, Japan and, to a less extent, China. The development  of home  manufacture in these countries had begun long before the  war, but  it received an enormous impetus  during  the  war years  when British manufacturers were so handicapped  that  to  a large  extent they lost their hold on  markets in which  they were formerly  supreme.  The advantage which their rivals thus secured has been  maintained  and extended since the war.      18.   The Indian cotton industry has replaced  a large  part  of  the piece-goods formerly imported from Great  Britain with goods  of  a  coarser  grade,  produced  in  India,  at  a  price  at  which  Lancashire, under present conditions, is unable to  compete.   The  Indian manufacturer has been materially assisted by Customs duties.      19.  Japan has  largely  ousted Great Britain from  the  China  market.  Japanese manufacturers have also developed a substantial  export trade to India and are now extending it from  the Far East  to  the other  main importing countries.   China also  has  greatly  increased its  production of factory-made  cotton goods.  Two  or  three  mills  only in  that country are controlled by  British Capital-  and over forty by Japanese capital.      20.  The expanding industry in the  United States has  been  directed,  for the most  part,  to supply the huge  home  market, but  there  are signs that,  with  its mass production methods, it may  become a strong competitor abroad in the future.   In the  United  States  the old  established factories  of the North are  suffering as  Lancashire  suffers,  and the trade is passing to new factories in  the Southern States equipped with  modern  expensive machinery,  some of which is run continuously, and staffed with  cheaper labour  than in the North.  In certain classes of  goods, the Italian cotton  trade is also making striking headway,     21.  The effect of this widespread increase in foreign competition  is  well illustrated in the following table,  showing the quantities of  cotton  piece-goods exported  from the United Kingdom  to various  groups of countries in  recent years, with the corresponding  figures  for 1913.  In every case the  figures show a decline in trade as corn-  pared with 1913.  The most serious  losses  are  seen in  exports to  British India, which, in 1929,  showed a fall of nearly 60 per cent.,  and to  China and Japan, which show a fall of over 70 per cent.

    22.   As it  is obvious what trade Lancashire has lost, so it isalmost equally obvious  how it has been lost.   Its successful rivalsproduce  and market cheap staple lines in bulk.   Often they usecotton which is good enough for them and their customers but hasnot been thought good enough by Lancashire.   The operatives  inIndia, China and Japan work for long hours at low pay.  In theUnited  States  especially,  expensive automatic machinery, with ahigh production-capacity to the weaver, is run for many more hours in the week than are the ordinary  looms in  this country.    23.   Lancashire must choose.  She can lose her trade, she canreduce her standard of wage and living, or, perhaps, she can keepher trade and  her wage standard by reducing costs and improvingmethods.  Her rivals produce for  stock,  use cheaper cotton andcontrol sales  and  orders.   It  is  for  the trade,  employers  andemployed in co-operation, to decide how salvation can  be foundin any or all of those changes.  Other  manufacturing countries donot start with the  advantages or  the  handicaps that Lancashirepossesses.   Their employers and  their operatives have  not  thetechnical skill  which  has  been  bred  into  Lancashire  throughgenerations and in which her employers and men have outdistancedall competitors.  They have not developed  the network of merchantfirms which have served Lancashire so well in the past, nor havethey  developed a futures market.   By not  hedging their  cottonthey made large gains  when cotton prices were  rising, but in  therecent period of falling prices, some of the Japanese trading  firms are stated, on  this account,  to have suffered severe  losses.   As a set-off against these handicaps, they are free from the adhesions ofcustom and practice and prejudice  well founded in  the past and difficult  to  shake off when conditions change.   It  was by herreadiness to adopt new ideas and practices that Lancashire gainedher trade  100  years ago  and beat her well-established rivals  ofIndia, who clung to old ideas.  Now times have changed, and once more  the trade passes to the manufacturer,  the  operative and themerchant,  who give the world what it wants at the price it can afford to pay.   24.   Lancashire  has  always  justly   prided  herself  on  theexcellence, both as to quality and design, of the cotton goods which she produces.   In these respects, she retains to-day her pre-eminentposition.  Unfortunately, however,  the bulk  of  the  consumers  ofexported cotton goods, many of whom are agriculturists, are persons whose purchasing power was always low and has,  in  many  cases,been reduced still further since the war.  Price is for consumers ofthis  class  the  essential factor, and the  success of Lancashire&apos;scompetitors, and, in particular, the success of Japan,  has been dueto &quot;their being able to manufacture cotton  goods  and market them at prices substantially less than those of competing goods made inLancashire.  The Japanese product  may not be as  good as that of lancashire, but it is sufficiently  good to satisfy the requirementsof the markets in which it is  sold.   To cheapen manufacture by long runs  of  the same design,  Japan has  linked marketing  to production and established a rational  control over her  industry.The  Japanese  industry  has  been handicapped by higher  capital costs, but  it has had  a lower wage level,  double-shifts,  longerhours worked by labour, proximity to markets,  monetary conditionsfavourable  to  export  and  lower  social  charges  upon  industry.Similar advantages  are, or have  been, enjoyed by  a number  ofother  competing countries.   25.   After making all  allowances for the  disadvantages whichhave their causes outside the cotton industry and are shared by theLancashire cotton industry with other British export trades,  we aresatisfied, from  the evidence laid before us, that the British cottonindustry has  failed  to adapt its   organisation  and  methods  tochanged  conditions and so has failed, and  is  failing, to secure thatcheapness of production and  efficiency in marketing  which alonesells staple goods in the East to-day.[21090]o
lu  III.-THE PRESENT ORGANISATION  OF  THE  COTTON                          INDUSTRY.    26.   The export trade  in  cotton goods, by far the greatest  ofBritish exports, as it was  built up and  grew steadily in the past,justified  the extreme  individualism  and lack of  general  controlover production and sale, which distinguished this from most othersuccessful industries.  One defect is inherent in this natural andconvenient disorganisation of  a  great trade, and,  in  the  violentchanges which followed the war, that one defect kills all the virtuesof the old system.   The separation of each part  of the trade fromthe others and of the markets from production, and the  lack  ofgeneral  control, prevent Lancashire from accepting and  spreadingover its  members the sacrifices  which radical change of practicerequire.  What was  probably the best of all systems in more stabletimes threatens ruin in a time of radical change.    27.   The industry, consisting of a  series of sharply  definedsections,  mutually  independent of  one  another,  and within eachsection consisting  of a large number of firms in competition with one  another, finds  it  difficult to concert  common  action  for thegood of the whole.                      (a)  The Raw Cotton.    28.   The raw cotton required by Lancashire is supplied by alarge number of importers  and brokers in Liverpool,  and in recentyears also  in  Manchester, who import  and hold the raw  cotton,and supply it to the individual spinning mills to the precise gradeand in the precise quantity required.            (b) Spinning and Manufacturing Sections.    29.   The spinning  section of the industry  consists  of manyhundreds of companies, most of whom own only  spinning mills and do not weave.   The  yarn  is generally sold, directly or throughyarn merchants and agents, either to weavers and other users, orfor export.   Most of  the spinning mills are public companies, whosecapital has been  raised by the issue of  partly-paid shares  and byloans repayable  at call.   Both shares  and   loans  are   widely distributed among all classes of the local community.  This  methodpresented real advantages in the old days of prosperity, but it hasled to great difficulty during the prolonged drain of the recent yearsof adversity.  The financial difficulties of many, particularly, of the&quot;American&quot;  mills  in the spinning section have been aggravated by  frenzied finance  during the  boom of 1919-20.   This  cannot,however, be said to have been responsible  for raising, but ratherfor depressing, the selling  price of yarn, owing to the uneconomiccompetition  of mills faced with the necessity  of meeting fixed-interest charges.    30.   The weaving  section  of the  industry,  which consists  ofa similar number of usually small  undertakings, weaves the yarninto grey cloth  to the order of  the merchants.  In contra-distinctionto  the spinning  section most of  the  weaving  mills  are   familybusinesses organised as private companies  or partnerships.    31.   The existence of so large a number of comparatively smallconcerns in both  the  weaving and the spinning sections, all  ofthem in active competition  with  one  another,  naturally  makescommon  action difficult and  delays the adoption of any  radical change.  Moreover,  in bad times, it tends to raise production coststhrough  part-time working and to lead to  uneconomic selling.                  (c)  The Merchanting  Section.    32.   Lancashire  has  relied  upon  the  merchants  as  the intelligence  department, the advertising agents,  the salesmen andthe arbiters of public  taste.   The merchants at  home  and  abroadare  very numerous,  and  bring to the door  of the  factory  inLancashire the world&apos;s market and the world&apos;s  price,  checked byconstant and free competition.  This system  is elastic, cheap and,up to a point, very efficient, but it has this  defect, that the business
of the  merchant is to sell cotton goods at a profit, not to sell thegoods of any particular producer and certainly not to face  a loss on a large speculative order in order to divert trade from a foreignto A British:producer.  He is a free merchant, not a salaried  agent.If Lancashire, owing to some such radical changes as  have recentlycccurred abroad,  becomes unable to sell  at the world&apos;s price, the merchants may tell the Lancashire manufacturer how he is beingbeaten.   The  merchant  is,  however,  misplaced  as  the  soleintelligence  department  and advertising agent;  in  fact, it mayalmost be said that Lancashire has conducted her trade in cheapand  staple goods on which so much  of her success depends inclose contact, through the merchant, with her customers but without an intelligence department and without  any advertisement  otherthan the excellence of her wares.   88.   The merchant keeps in constant touch with the marketsall over the world, secures the orders, and supplies the goods to the precise requirements of the customers, but not necessarily the goods of Lancashire.  He orders  the  grey  cloth  from the  manufacturerand has it finished to his own specification, and finances  the wholetransaction from  the delivery of the grey cloth from  the  mill untilpayment by the buyer after  delivery  of the completed cloth.  Theother sections of  the industry are not systematically  in touch withthe ultimate  market, and, with the exception of a  few firms, are entirely dependent upon the merchant as regards the  size, the timeand  the  nature  of orders.   The practice of merchants consigninggoods abroad for sale, which prevailed to an important  extent forcertain markets  before  the war, has greatly diminished, and mostof the cloth produced is only made after the order is received fromabroad.  In the very important trade in &quot; fancy goods &quot;  of infinitevariety,  in which Lancashire is still predominant,  this  system  of producing only to order has continued, up to the present, to work, onthe whole, remarkably well.  In the great bulk trade in  low-pricedstandard goods,  the system has, in our  opinion, failed.   34.   For the sale of these low-priced standard cloths, price tothe buyer is the important factor.  They must be cheap; price ismore important than quality, and  a largo order giving a long runto spinner,  manufacturer  and finisher on  one specification is thebasis of low  cost.  The merchants  cannot  be sure of  a  steadymarket, and, therefore, cannot give the large order, and the  Britishproducer cannot, therefore, produce as  cheaply as his foreign rivalswho assume,  through their agents, the risk of selling and produce in bulk in order to produce  cheaply.   Nothing could, therefore,  bemore  anomalous than  the.  present  position.  The  manufacturerhimself often possesses little knowledge of the overseas market anddepends for orders on the  merchant,  whose  interests,  if a shortview is taken, are different  from his.  It is  to the interest of the producers  that,  when  a particular class of goods  is assailed  by foreign  competition, every  effort  should be -made to defeat thatcompetition.  In such  circumstances, however, the  merchant istempted to abandon  the struggle and  to employ his capital to thebest advantage  to himself without reference  to the position of theproducing sections.    85.  Many of the merchant firms are small, but there are somehundreds of substantial undertakings.    The existence of so manymerchants and  so much competition  is  not  an unmixed blessing.Foreign orders tend to be split up among several merchants at lower prices than those at which they would have been given to one.  Wewere informed  in evidence that,  in  some cases, the number ofmerchants&apos;  representatives visiting a market so far exceed require-ments that the orders obtained are insufficient even to cover the costof the salaries of the representatives employed.  The trade must, inthe end, pay for  this extravagance.                    (d) The Finishing  Section.    86.  The trades  in  the  Finishing  Section, which work almost entirely on a commission basis to the orders of the merchants, have,for  some time,  been strongly organised in three  associations of bleachers, dyers  and printers respectively.  Further, within each      [21090]                                           o 2
of these associations, there  is a  large combine which  exercises  adominating influence.  These measures of organisation  were takento  meet excessive competition which had  reduced the  finishingtrades to a condition of unprofitable  trading, inefficiency and low wages.   The finishing trades thus form a notable  exception to thedisunion which characterises the other parts  of the industry.  the associations of bleachers, dyers and printers, which contain the bulkof the firms engaged  in these trades, fix the prices  to be charged bytheir members, and  in this way have enabled them to  maintain  aprosperity  in  striking contrast to the condition  of the  rest of theindustry.  That  this prosperity  is not  the main cause  of  thedecline  in the cotton  trade (as has been suggested in some  quarters)is evidenced by the fact that the greatest fall in exports has  beenin unfinished goods, and that, although the exports of printed goodshave fallen nearly as much as those of grey cloth, bleached  anddyed goods are, as yet, much less affected by foreign competition.Both costs and  prices have,  however,  increased  much  more infinishing than  in other  processes of cotton manufacture.  Theincrease is  said  to be largely due to short-time  working,  to thesmall size  of the individual orders given by merchants  and to thegreat variety of finishes which they require.  Long runs mean lowcosts.  Some efforts have been made by the finishing trades in thelast  few years  to adjust prices and conditions, in such a way as toassist in the recovery of export trade, but  these efforts have  beenhampered by  the  lack of organisation among the merchants.  the firms in these  finishing  trades  are largely  dependent on  ordersreceived from  the  small merchants and, therefore, hesitate  to offendthem by offering an  appropriate reduction for long runs.  greater flexibility in finishing charges, and reductions for large  orders and long runs,  are, we are convinced,  a necessary contribution  to anyorganised effort to restore prosperity  to the cotton industry.                     (e)  The Packing  Section.   37.   The firms engaged in the making-up and packing  of piece-goods, an important  and highly skilled operation, are also stronglyorganised.   The Master  Packers&apos; Association,  which  covers  thepackers of other textile goods as well as cotton goods, is a price-fixingbody.   The usual basis for the packing of  cotton goods is  thatmerchants  rent part of a warehouse from  the packers,  and  are changed, in addition, so much per  case  of goods  packed.   Agree-ments exist  between the Master  Packers&apos;  Association  and  the operatives.             IY.-TECHNICAL RE-EQUIPMENT.   38.   Having briefly described  the  principal sections  into whichthe industry is&apos; divided,  we propose how to draw  attention  to theevidence which has come  before  us on  the  question of technicalre-equipment  in  the &quot;spinning  and  manufacturing  sections  of  theindustry.   We have already drawn attention  (paragraph 13) to thefact  that it  is in the coarse end of the trade, in standard goods, whereprice is the chief consideration, that this country has lost, and is stilllosing, most ground  to foreign  competition.  In bulk these goodsforma large part of Lancashire&apos;s output, and are of great importance from the point of view of employment.   39.  If Lancashire is to recover a  part of this trade or even tohold its present position, every practicable measure must be takento reduce  production costs.   One of the most important  of  themeasures that  require  consideration  is  the  use,  in  the  most economic way,  of the most efficient  machinery.   Unfortunately,the very success of the Lancashire cotton  industry in  developingefficient  methods  in  the  conditions   of   the   past,   and   thethoroughness  with which an equilibrium  has been   established between  the  interests concerned on the basis of those methods,is to-day  responsible  in  part  for  a  disinclination  to  explorenew  possibilities and try new methods, many of which have alreadybeen exploited with  success,  for example in the southern parts ofthe United  States  and in Japan.  We  have not found it  possible toobtain costings of sufficient accuracy to enable us to forecast what
economies could be secured by the adoption of the various measuresto which our attention has been drawn.  Taken by themselves, the economies likely to result from the adoption of any one of those measures may  not be great,  but they are  all steps in the  right direction, and  no  one can  say how far that path of reform maylead.   British trade is not so  well placed to-day that it can afford to  ignore  any economies.    We-  offer  no definite  conclusionsregarding the relative merits  of these measures,  or the extent  towhich  they  are  practicable.  Nor do we suggest that every one  ofthe measures which  we  mention is  likely  to  be  suitable for  allclasses of goods.  We are convinced, however,  that  all deservecareful study.   The   employers and  operatives  engaged  in theindustry are best placed  to know the conditions in their own  tradeand what is even more important while we can suggest to  themeffort and sacrifice and co-operation, it is by them that action willhave to  be  taken.   The success of many of these experimentsdepends on active and whole-hearted co-operation between employersand operatives.  Such co-operation would afford a means of carryingout a thorough and sympathetic study  and testing of new possibili-ties with a view to  the advantage of both sides of the industry. Signsare not wanting that there is a growing recognition of this necessityamongst many parties  in  the cotton trade, but  a much  more vigorous and sustained effort  on both  sides will be  required if the reforms that are essential to the recovery of Lancashire are  to becarried out.                       (a) Indian  Cotton.    40.   For the manufacture of the cheap cloths with which theyhave so  largely ousted British goods in the Eastern markets, theJapanese have  made extensive use  of  the short-stapled Indiancotton; but  only an insignificant fraction  (about 5 per cent, of lastyear&apos;s  exports)  of the Indian crop is absorbed by Lancashire.  Thiscotton  has  been  substantially  cheaper  than  the longer-stapledAmerican cotton, partly because Lancashire  has not bought it.  Inthis way Lancashire has  allowed  Japan to  start with  an  initialadvantage in the price of raw  material  which she increases at every stage of manufacture and distribution.   In present circumstances the Lancashire  cotton industry cannot afford to use for the manu-facture of cheap goods higher quality cotton than that  successfullyused by  her foreign rivals.    41.   One of the secrets of the success of the Japanese in the useof  this  cotton  appears  to  lie  in  their  skill  in  mixing  differentgrowths  of cotton. We  are assured that Lancashire has the skillto make equally good cloth out of such  mixtures if her spinners,manufacturers and operatives are prepared to co-operate to that end.          (b) Improvements in the Spinning Processes.   42.  According  to the  evidence received,  the  use  of  short-stapled  cotton  would  be facilitated by  the substitution of ringspindles for the mules now generally  used in Lancashire.   this change would also probably be required for the production of yarnsuitable for weaving on automatic looms,  although some success, itis  claimed, has been  attained in the weaving of mule-spun yarnson  such  looms.    Further,  the use of  short-stapled   cotton  toproduce   coarser  counts  of  yarn  would  upset  the  existingbalance  between  the  processes  preparatory  to  spinning  andthe  spinning itself.   Some  witnesses  expressed  the  view thatto  feed the same number of spindles, the cardroom machinery wouldhave to be extended, or else double shifts worked in these processes.They added that before spinners could adapt their mills to the useof  short-stapled cotton, they  would  require to be assured of theexistence  of adequate arrangements for  weaving  the yarn   soproduced  and for marketing the  cloth when made.   48.  At the present time, owing to the competition of the largenumbers  of spinning  mills, much  yarn  is  produced by mills  ofqualities and counts other than those for  which their machinery is
Y CLOSER CO-OPERATION BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND    *                        OPERATIYES.   47.  One  important  reason  why  the  question  of  improvedmethods and equipment  has  not  received adequate examination isthat many of the firms engaged in the spinning and manufacturingsections are financially weak.  Another  is that  such improvementsnecessitate  re-adjustment  of  hardly-won   and  long-establishedagreements  between  employers  and employed.   Moreover,  theintroduction  of  some  of them  must,  as  the  first result,  causeincreased unemployment.  On the other hand, the continued declinein exports of cotton goods  is  rapidly  extending  unemploymentwithout any accompanying prospect of subsequent improvementby the recovery  of trade.   48.  We  are  convinced  that  these   technical   changes  ofmachinery and  method  require immediate  and  serious  examina-tion   by  employers and  operatives in concert.    There  mustbe whole-hearted co-operation between  the  two sides, based upona frank disclosure of information about the changes  to be  made and  the results  expected from them.   Some tentative steps haveindeed already been taken in this direction,  as for instance  in therecent experiment  at  Burnley  of  working eight looms  to eachweaver.   It  will only be  by  the  closest  co-operation  that anysubstantial progress can be made.   49.  More generally, there, is need  in the  cotton industry forconstant co-operation in the adjustment from  time  to  time  of detailed methods of working in the mill  in such a way  as to securethe maximum output under the best conditions, and for the  reviewof matters between employers  and trade unions for  the  industry as a whole,  or for individual sections, in order  to secure a greater flexibility  for adjustment to changing conditions.  As  an examplemay be cited the lists of  weaving piece wage rates,  which were established in great elaboration many years ago, and which,  exceptfor modifications in points  of detail, have remained unchanged tothis  day.     It  may  be  found  that there  would  be substantialadvantage in their reconsideration with a view to the establishmentof greater flexibility and possibly to agreement upon a new basismore  satisfactory to both sides.best adapted. This practice is uneconomic, but is a natural result ofthe present conditions by which  small independent  mills competew7ith one another for a reduced volume of business.   44.  Foreign  cotton  industries  are making increased use of high draft spinning machinery and the practicability of  extendingits use in Lancashire should, in our view, be carefully considered.Again,  in  preparing  the yarn for weaving, high  speed windingmachinery is said to  offer considerable economies,  but it has  not as yet to any considerable extent been adopted  in Lancashire.           (c)  Automatic and Semi-automatic  Looms.   45.  Another  very important question is the introduction of automatic looms for the weaving of those standard cloths in whichLancashire has been largely driven out of the market.  These loomsdo not, as a rule, give a greater output per loom, but each weavercan mind a very  much larger  number  than in the case of  theordinary power loom, and thus an important saving in wage costsis possible, concurrently with an improvement in the remuneration of the individual weaver.  For some cloths, at any rate, it has beensuggested that it may be sufficient to add attachments to the ordinaryloom containing some  only of the features of the automatic loomand costing proportionately less.   The  initial  cost of  automaticlooms is high,  and we received important evidence  that  automaticlooms could not be worked economically on a single  shift per day,and that double shifts would be necessary for their effective use.   46.  Such   far-reaching  mechanical  changes  involve  seriousconsiderations of cost and of policy vital alike to organised operativesand employers.
                   YI. REORGANISATION.                (a) The purposes of reorganisation.    50.   Technical re-equipment  -will  require capital.  Moreover, in many cases  substantial expenditure is required for re-conditioning existing plants.  This  finance  could  not be  obtained  by  the relatively small concerns, often heavily burdened with debt, which, at present, constitute the greater  part of the industry.    51.   The  examples  already  given  in  paragraphs  41-46  are enough to show that it is of the essence of any technical reorganisa- tion of the industry that there should be the  most careful adjustment between the various processes of production.  This would require much closer co-operation between spinning  and  weaving mills than exists  today.   Further,  to justify  the  installation  of  automatic machinery  and  to   permit  of  its   economic   working  there must be  besides full  support from  the operatives an  assurance of adequate arrangements  for marketing,  so that  the  machinery may  work  at  full pressure upon a  narrow  range of  products without frequent readjustment to  different qualities or counts. This aspect of reorganisation, therefore,  reinforces  strongly  the argu- ments for the formation of both  large and  strong units  within  the spinning and manufacturing sections,  and also for the establishment of a close relation throughout the various stages of  production from the raw material to the marketing of the finished product.   52.   Finally, we are satisfied that to hold or regain the trade in cheap staple lines, one of the most urgently needed  reforms is the linking of marketing with production.  To  produce  cheaply it is necessary to produce in bulk.  To  produce  in  bulk a  rational policy of marketing must be joined  to production, and no  successful policy  of mass  production  can  be conceived or executed  without the market organisation appropriate  to  that policy.  The  number of separate concerns in the spinning,  manufacturing and merchant- ing  sections of the  industry  is,  in present  conditions,  largely responsible for its helplessness in the cheap bulk trade and. renders impossible  the  establishment of a consistent policy for meeting foreign  competition throughout  the world in that   trade.   53.  We  proceed,  therefore, to  examine  the  steps towardsreorganisation that have been taken in recent years in Lancashire.These are of two kinds.  The first consists of the amalgamation of asufficient number of existing firms to form a combine large enough tosecure  the  maximum  economies  obtainable  from working on massproduction lines in the spinning section.  The second has  taken theform of co-operation on a representative basis between the  various sections of the trade.          (b) Recent movements towards amalgamation.   54.   The outstanding amalgamation of recent years  has beenthat carried out in the spinning section by the Lancashire  CottonCorporation.   At the time when the Corporation was formed,  the spinning section was suffering from the complications of two diseases,bad trade and bad finance after the reflotation, at inflated  values, ofmany cotton mills in  1919-20.   Many of the spinning mills wereinsolvent and were only kept alive by their creditors.  The  CottonCorporation was formed with the  support of the Bank of england for the purpose of amalgamating a substantial number of  these andother mills.  Many of  the mills  that entered the Corporation did soreluctantly and as the result of  pressure put upon them by  one orother of the creditor banks.  The obligations issued by the Corpora-tion in return for each  mill are based upon an  estimate of the actualvalue at that time of its assets.   This method involves the  surrenderby creditors,  both secured and unsecured, of a part of their  rights.Any uncalled capital is called up, but only over an extended  period(five years),  and  the  shareholders in every  case  are  given someinterest in the amalgamation.
   The shareholders have been forced to face their losses, which is,of course,  unpleasant, but it is  better than the only  alternative,namely,  liquidation.   The Corporation is  in the course  of taking over some 8,000,000 spindles, and is  expected shortly to control10,000,000.   Up  to  the present  it has  been fully occupied In response-organising and  amalgamating the spinning mills it has acquired,and, so  far,  it has taken over only a relatively small  number oflooms.   55.   Some of the mills when  acquired by the Lancashire CottonCorporation  were  technically inefficient,  as  well  as  financiallyunsound.  Others are, however,  highly efficient from the  technical point of  view.  After re-conditioning suitable mills, the Corporationhopes, with the advantage of economies in purchasing, producing,and  selling, to make  a contribution to the  recovery of a part of thecheap  bulk trade  that Lancashire  has lost.   56.   When  the  Lancashire  Cotton  Corporation secures  the10,000,000 spindles at which it  is aiming, it will  control between one-quarter and  one-third of the  total spindles in  the AmericanSection.   No experience is available to show to what size a spinningcombination can be carried before the economies resulting from com-bination are  more than offset by disadvantages in other directions.Unless,  however,  the Corporation  is to be extended much beyondthe  size at present in view, we are  convinced that it will  be ofthe  utmost importance to the industry that other well-consideredlarge-scale amalgamations should take place in the spinning section.    57.  Similarly, although  there may  be room for  small  firmsweaving &quot;fancies,&quot; it is essential, if the slide into insolvency is tobe checked, financial and technical  reorganisation rendered possible,and the  manufacturing section enabled to take any effective common action,  that  manufacturers  should  group themselves  in  suitableamalgamations.   Amalgamations in weaving are  indeed necessaryto balance those in spinning and to ensure a steady  market for theyarn produced.  In merchanting, again, large scale amalgamations, as   has  already   been   indicated  (paragraph  35),  are  equally necessary.     58.   Amalgamations of  the kind we have  in mind in the spinning  and manufacturing sections would  be large enough to secure the maximum economies from bulk production and strong enough  to obtain the finance required for the equipment of  their mills  with the most efficient modern machinery.  Their formation is, however,  only the first essential step in the  path of recovery. Spinning  and   weaving  must  be  closely   related,  so   that a   due   balance  may   be   kept  between  the   production  of yarn  and the outlet for it in weaving  and in  the  sale  of the finished product.   One possible   method  is by  combination of spinning  and weaving   concerns.   Failing the  adoption of  this method, which  in present  conditions may be  open  to  difficulty, it   is   essential  that  the   spinning   amalgamations,    when formed,  should  take  concerted  action  with  corresponding amalgamations in the manufacturing section,  with a  view to the formation of a common  policy.  They would then be  in a position to enter into negotiations with the suggested amalgamations in the merchanting section and to frame a  sales policy which suits the needs of  production.  One  primary object to  be secured would be the sale  abroad  of  standard goods at the world&apos;s market price.  This  bulk trade  is  essential to the  well-being of  the Lancashire industry.  Another important object would be  to give larger and  steadier orders  to the  finishers.   The  reduced  cost  of executing such  orders would enable the finishers to reduce their  charges and  thus, without loss  to themselves, to aid the all-round reduction  in production costs  which is so urgently  required.     59.   It  has  been suggested that  the very  slow progress that  has  so far been  made  in the  direction of  re-organising  the  industry  on  a   more efficient  and  competitive  basis,  except  in  the Lancashire  Cotton Corporation,   is due,  in part,  to  the  difficulty of  securing the additional capital required.   Admittedly,  further capital  on a  large scale  cannot be  found,  in  present
circumstances, from the cotton industry itself or the  people  of lancashire, who, in the past,  have invested largely in the industry.We  have,  therefore, explored  the  question  whether there  is reasonable likelihood that fresh capital would be forthcoming fromother sources.   60.   In view of  the bad trade of recent years, it would not bepossible at the present time for existing concerns in the spinning and manufacturing sections,  and  especially in the former,  to obtaincapital  for a public issue.    In many  cases, especially  in the spinning  section,  the banks  have  already  made large advancesand  they  could not  reasonably be  expected  to increase  these further.   Indeed,  it is highly improbable that  the industry  could secure further finance, which  is so necessary, unless it is preparedto change its present form  of organisation.  In view, however,of the  evidence which  the  Governor of the  Bank  of Englandhas been good enough to put before us, we are satisfied that, if well-considered schemes  are  forthcoming  for  rationalisation  in the spinning, manufacturing and  merchanting sections, the necessaryfinance will be provided, if, on examination, the  technical, adminis-trative and financial aspects of the schemes are found comprehensive and satisfactory.  The recently-formed Bankers&apos; Industrial Develop-ment Company, Limited, has for its objects the consideration of such schemes  submitted by industry  and the giving of advice  and ofassistance in putting them into an acceptable form.  The Companyhas already announced that, in the case of schemes which  may be approved, arrangements will be made  for the  provision one way or another and through existing agencies of such monies as may  seemto be essential.      (c) The Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations.    61.   We turn now to the consideration of the interesting  and important  step taken  some years ago in the  establishment of theJoint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations.   This Committeeconsists  of  leading  representatives of  spinners,  manufacturers,finishers, merchants, and operatives, in almost all cases appointedofficially by  the  association  in  the  section concerned.  It is  thusthoroughly representative of the various branches of the industry.The task entrusted to the Committee is the examination of all means by which united action by the various sections  of the industry couldpromote the recovery of Lancashire&apos;s trade.    62;   The Joint Committee,  which  has been greatly assisted inits  task  by the Cotton  Trade Statistical Bureau set up in  1927,has  already considered various  aspects of the  problems and needsof the industry, and has issued a number of valuable reports.   It is taking steps for the interchange of  ideas and  information betweenthe  various sections,  and for the closer linking of research and practice.   It is also investigating new  uses for cotton&quot; goods and considering the possibilities  of  organised propaganda.    63.   The  cotton  industry  as a whole  has for a long timesupported the development of Empire supplies of cotton through theBritish Cotton-Growing Association and the  Empire Cotton-GrowingCorporation,  and scientific research  into the problems affecting  theindustry through the Cotton Industry Research Association.   the setting up  of the  Cotton Trade Statistical  Bureau was a valuablestep towards the much needed improvement of the statistical dataavailable to the industry.   The Joint Committee has  itself addedco-operation  in a wider  field.  That much remains to be done inthe  way  of improving and amplifying  existing  statistics  was,however, very  forcibly brought home  to us in the  course of our inquiry.   Great practical advantage would arise from the  further development and co-ordination  of economic and technical  inquiryin matters  affecting the  industry.   64.  It appears to us that the policy of joint inquiry on behalfof the industry might  be pursued  by  a personal examination  of conditions  in  some of  the  great  markets  abroad.  A thoroughlyrepresentative mission  to the Far East,  for instance, would  be able  -  [21090&quot;!                                             D
strengthened and itsMartivjtigs developed  ^Ofr.  We summarise our general conclusions as follows:    (i) Since before the war the world consumption of cotton piece-goods appears to have risen, but the yardage of such goods exported from  Great Britain is now less than two-thirds  of what it  was in1910-13.   (ii)  By far the most serious losses of trade are those in the exportof coarse standard  lines  of cotton piece-goods.   The information available from the trade returns does not enable precise figures to begiven for these lines of  goods.  It  may be noted, however, that the exports of grey unbleached piece-goods, which in 1913 amounted to2,357,492 thousand linear yards,  had fallen by  1924 to 1,402,275thousand linear yards.   Since that  date there has been a progressiveto gain  an understanding  of  the conditions  there  to which  theBritish cotton trade has to  adapt itself,  and in which it has to sellits goods, such as no study  of written reports could give.  It might enable the industry to establish and renew even closer contact  thanat present with those markets,  and to increase  appreciation there ofBritish work and British goods.  Should the industry decide to  send out such  a mission or missions, we recommend that  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should do all in their power to facilitate and assist their work.   65.   Probably the most valuable contribution  which the JointCommittee has made rests in the  example it has set to Lancashireof the benefits to be obtained  from co-operation.  The Committeestands  for a  practical movement  towards  common  thinkingand  co-ordinated  action  between  the  various sections  which we regard as of  the  best  augury and. as worthy  of  the warmestsupport in Lancashire.   It will prove, we believe, to  be self-help ofthe most  fruitful kind.   This effort is all the more valuable in that representatives of the operatives  as well as of the  employers areactively engaged in its development.  We  are thus  encouraged to hope  that it  may be  the  prelude, to  a systematic  co-operationbetween  the two sides for  the recovery of the  trade upon whichthey both depend.   66.   We cannot conclude our discussion of the work of the JointCommittee without referring to the practical efforts which it is takingtowards  the co-ordination of  production and  marketing.  A  verysignificant step towards what may be termed &apos;&apos; vertical co-operation &apos;&apos;was taken by the Joint Committee when it sponsored  an experiment in the bulk production and marketing of a particular  standard clothfor China.  In this experiment all sections  combined in an  effort to reduce production costs to a  competitive level.  It  was conducted by an  ad hoc  syndicate  formed by the various concerns that wereparties to the  scheme.   67.   The Joint Committee is now setting up machinery for widerexperiments in the co-operative production and marketing of standardcloths.   One  object of  these  experiments  will  be  to  secure  the economies of mass  production.    Spinners,  manufacturers  andfinishers will join in the scheme, and the various processes of produc-tion will be co-ordinated.  The marketing policy will be systematicallydirected to the steady disposal of the output decided upon and to theestablishment  of the cloths in the markets for which they are suited.Attention will, no doubt, be given to the possibility of carrying the marketing of the goods  nearer  to the ultimate consumer than  hashitherto been  the practice.  It  is proposed to use Indian and otherEmpire cottons, and if, in this connection, arrangements can be madefor the economical purchase, in bulk, of such cottons, they may bemore  readily  available  in  Lancashire  for  spinners outside  thisparticular scheme.   68.   We see  in the constitution  and work of the Joint Committeeone of the most hopeful signs of a new spirit in the cotton industry.The Committee has already done good work and has, in our opinion,still  greater  possibilities.   We  trust  that its  position will be
  decline,  exports in 1929  falling  as low as 954,823 thousand linear  yards. The exports of prints also have fallen from 1,230,754 thousand  in 1913 to 551,706 yards last year.      (iii) Losses in the  export trade have  not been confined  to  the  coarse standard  lines,  and there are increasing indications  that  competition is becoming keener in all classes of cotton piece-goods,  including the finer and more varied lines.      (iv) The markets in  which Lancashire  has suffered  the most  serious losses are those in the Far East, particularly India, China and  Japan.     As regards India,  the large falling  off of cotton goods exported  from Lancashire is,  in the main, due to  an increase in the production  of cotton goods in India, but also partly to Japanese competition.     Outside  India, the most formidable competition is from Japan.  The Japanese cotton industry has grown sufficiently powerful not only  td^ supply its home market,  but also to develop a formidable  export  business, largely  at  the expense  of  Lancashire.   Japanese  cotton  goods are at present mainly exported to the eastern markets, but the  Japanese are extending  their export trade to more distant countries,  e.g., to East Africa.     (v) Until far-reaching  improvements are  introduced  into  the  British industry, there is no likelihood that Lancashire will be able  to  arrest the decline  in her export trade, still less   that she  will  recover the  trade which  she has lost.     (vi) The organisation of the Lancashire cotton industry, with the  exception of the finishing section,  is substantially the same as that  which existed in the nineteenth century, but her  successful foreign  riv?.ls  in  world trade  have  adopted  a very  different method  of  organisation.  Their system is based on  the establishment  of  the  closest relations between production and marketing.     (vii) The marketing of  Lancashire piece-goods  is at present  conducted almost exclusively on the basis of the acceptance of orders  that are individually profitable to  the merchant concerned without  regard to the needs  of production  or to the economies that may  be  achieved in standard goods by mass production and long runs.     (viii) To enable the manufacture of standard goods once more to  be energetically  developed, Lancashire requires a marketing system  so organised  as to secure a steady  outlet for goods produced by  the  most economic methods.     (ix) The  cost  of  production  of cotton goods  in  Lancashire  is substantially higher than that  in the  countries which offer her the most serious competition.   If  that competition is to be met, it is essential that the employers and  operatives  in all sections of the industry should  reduce  costs and  increase efficiency  by concerted action.    (x)  There are three possible ways  by which these two purposes may be approached,  namely, (a) the technical improvement of the . spinning and manufacturing sections, involving considerable re-equip- ment;   (b)  the formation of  larger  units within each section of the industry;  (c) the extension  of  co-operative  effort  on the  lines initiated by  the  Joint Committee  of  Cotton  Trade Organisations. These methods are interrelated, and it  is not to be expected that any one of them by itself could be effective.    (xi)  In the preceding conclusions we have  endeavoured  to  state the various remedies that it is open to Lancashire herself to  apply to her  present troubles.^There  is no  alternative  method  of recovery. The system which brought prosperity to the Cotton Industry is to-day manifestly inadequate to meet  the  strain of modern conditions.  A new world has emerged from  the chaos created by the war,  and the great losses that  Lancashire has since suffered are in large part due to an attempt to conduct its industry on pre-war lines and to a refusal to recognise that the old conditions, so favourable to Lancashire,  have passed  away  for ever.   Recent years  of adversity have, however, given some proof that the leaders of Lancashire realise the gravity of the situation and the need for new methods to cope with it.   Thenecessary measures for re-organisation are known and  the  financerequired is available.   The well-being of the  Cotton Industry is more than the concern of Lancashire herself.  It Is of  vital interest to the country as a whole.No  nation could tolerate  the  neglect of hopeful means of recovery     [21090]                                             D 2
when confronted with the decline of so important an export industry with the burden of hardship and misery which such a decline mustmean to the workers whose employment is destroyed.  The crisis is urgent and immediate action is  imperative.  We are  confident thatthe organised  operatives and employers of Lancashire will embarkforthwith upon the serious consideration of the measures essential tothe recovery of their trade.  If,  however,  this hope is disappointed,or if any section proves recalcitrant, we  think it  right to place on record our considered view that it would be the duty of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment themselves to consider inviting  Parliament to  conferupon them any necessary powers.                **a*T-RECOMMENDATIONS.  -&quot;3 -  In the light of the foregoing conclusions, we recommend thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should take every step  in their power to urge on the employers and operatives in  Lancashire the importanceof considering the following possible means of reducing the costs ofproduction and recovering the lost export trade in cotton goods.  Theyare methods  which  have proved of economic value to Lancashire&apos;ssuccessful rivals, and they are of sufficient importance to justify themost  careful  consideration.  In most cases their  application  couldonly be gradual and would require at every stage the closest and mostcordial  co-operation  between  the employers and  operatives  of lancashire.           Possible Methods of Technical Improvement.   (i) For the manufacture of cheap standard lines in which british goods have been so largely ousted from the eastern markets, extensiveuse has been made of  the short-stapled Indian cotton.  This  hashitherto been but little used in  Lancashire, where the longer-stapledbut more  expensive American  cotton has been almost  exclusivelypreferred.  In this way her competitors, some of whom have acquiredgreat  skill in  the mixing of Indian and other cottons with american cotton, have  secured  an initial  advantage over Lancashire by  usinga cheaper cotton for their manufactures.   (ii) Other countries  use ring spindles to a  much greater extent than  Lancashire,  and  this method  of spinning  is  of especialimportance where Indian and other short-stapled cotton is to be used.The use of such cotton might  also require  a re-adjustmenti of  the,balance between cardroom and  spinning machinery.   High  draftspinning  machinery and high-speed winding  machinery  have alsobeen found to offer the possibility of valuable economies.   (iii) In the manufacturing  section the most important develop-ment  abroad  has been the  introduction of automatic  and  semi-automatic looms for the weaving of standard cloths.   These do not,as a rule, give a greater output per loom, but each weaver can minda very much  larger  number of looms than in the case of the ordinarypower loom as used  in Lancashire.  In this way, an important saving in wage costs is possible concurrently with  an improvement in  the remuneration of the individual weaver.   (iv)  The initial cost of automatic looms, and, to a less extent, of automatic attachments to ordinary looms, is high, and  we receivedimportant  evidence  that  automatic  looms could  not  be  workedeconomically  on a single shift per day.                         Amalgamation.   (v) The formation of larger units  in  the spinning and manufac-turing sections of the industry  would serve  three great purposes:(o) They would permit full advantage to be taken of any possibilitiesof technical improvement and would secure economies in production costs; (6) they would enable a common  policy to be formulated  and carried into effect within each  of  these sections;  (c)  they wouldprovide a firm basis for such a measure of  co-ordination between those engaged in the various processes of production and  marketing as  willenable Lancashire once more to take the  initiative in the markets ofthe world.  These  units should  be strong enough to formulate adefinite production  policy  and to enter into arrangements with  one
another and with the other sections of the industry,  including the merchants and the finishers, for a forward policy.  The finishers arealready combined to a substantial extent, and the formation of strong and well-balanced amalgamations among the merchants also deservescareful consideration.   (vi) Considerable sums of  fresh capital  may be required inconnection  with  amalgamations for such purposes as re-conditioningand re-equipping mills and for development.  We are assured that, forany comprehensive and satisfactory rationalisation scheme having forits object the reduction of production costs and improved marketing,the necessary finance will be forthcoming.   Development of Co-operative Effort throughout the Industry.   (vii) Valuable service is being rendered to the cotton industry bythe Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations.   The  experi-ments  that are being set on  foot under the auspices of the Committeein co-operative production and systematic marketing of  standard linesof goods should provide a practical testing ground of the possibilitiesof solving what  we  regard as the central problem of the industry.More  generally,  the Committee can do valuable work  in  variousdirections,  in  economic  investigation and  its  co-ordination  withtechnical research and in the practical application of both, in the interchange of ideas and information between the various sections ofthe industry, in organised  propaganda and the finding of new usesfor  cotton.  The Joint Committee affords an opportunity  for thedevelopment of a centre of information and study, a common mind, a concerted policy, for the industry as a whole.   (viii) The  changed conditions abroad,  particularly  in the far east, have  vitally affected the position at home. We believe  that advantage might accrue from an examination of these conditions onthe spot by  the representatives of the British industry. In the eventof the industry  deciding to send  out a mission  or missions for thispurpose, we recommend  that His Majesty&apos;s Government should do all in their power to facilitate and assist their work.(SLGNEAT&quot;   J.
