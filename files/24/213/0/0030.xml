In accordance with my promise to supply furtherstatistical information and with reference to Cabinet 35 (30),Conclusion 6, I circulate the following statistical Tablesbearing on Irish Immigration  into Scotland and the questionof the character, etc, of the Irish population in Scotland:-     Paup e r 1 sxa.

Percentages of children in Roman Catholic and  otherschools during last 30 years (Table E, part 5).       (The only available statistics bearing upon this  matter are those relating to the number of children  in&apos; Reman Catholic schools.; tut these statistics  afford no sure basis for a numerical estimate of the  number of Irish immigrants to Scotland in recent years.  They do&quot;not even afford conclusive evidence as to  whether Irish  immigration has been on the increase or  decreaseo   They do, however, give considerable support  to the presumption that the proportion borne by the                                                      -  population of  Irish origin or extraction to the total  population of  Scotland is increasing).       Endeavour is being made to collect further  information on the general question of the Irish  population in  Scotland.  As regards the Irish-born  peculation in  Scotland; the Second Voiurae of the  Report on the  1921 Census of Scotland contains                                                          &apos; I.  the iollowing  paragraph -          &quot;The total number of persons of Irish birth,     159,030, snows a decrease of 15,695 when compared                                        -     with what it was in 1911 and a decrease of                                              -     46,044 when compared with what it was in 1901.                         if-                               I I
   The counties containing the largest numbers of Irish-   born are Lanark (98,753),  Renfrew (18,766), Dumbarton   (9,261), Ayr (8,349),&quot;and:  Midlothian (3,031),  and those   with the smallest numbers.are Shetland (11) , fTairn (31).   and Orkney (32).  Irish-born in the City of Glasgow   number 65,**88,  and in the  City of Edinburgh 6,382.   The counties in which the  Irish-born constitute the   largest percentages are Renfrew (6.28), Dumbarton (6,14),   and Lanark (6*03).   In the Burgh of Port Glasgow this   percentage is 12.99, and in Ooatbridge 10.29.   In the   County of Shetland it is 0.04, in Orkney 0.13, in   Caithness 0.16, in Ross and Cromarty 0.19,  and in Banff   and. in Sutherland 0.24.   In the Burghs of Aberdeen,   Inverness, and Kirkcaldy it is loss than 1.0,    Of the   159,020 persons of Irish birth, 88.397 were born in the   six Counties of northern Ireland.&quot;      It will be seen that the number of persons  of Irishbirth in Scotland decreased by 30-349 between 1901 and 1911,and bj?- 15,695 between 1911 end 1921, vshile in each of thesedecennial periods  the total population of Scotland increased.Further  information on this  point will be furnished by the1931 Census.       As regards the character of the Irish population InScotland, it has frequently been represented that persons of irish birth or extraction are undesirable in Scotland becausethey are less independent than the native population, andmore likely to become a burden on the Poor Law authorities:and  also because  they are less orderly than the native population, and tend to supply an undue proportion of theScottish criminal class.   It will be seen, however, fromTable A that  the  percentage  of Irish pauperism to total
pauperism in Scotland slightly declined in 192.9,  and hasin no year from 1921 onwards reached the level (7^9%)which it attained in 1911:  while Table 0 shows that from.1925 onwards the proportion of Irish critrae to total crimein Scotland has each rear been steadily diminishing, beingnow only 17*1, as against Z5vZ&apos;jo in 1925,       In the case of tho information relating to criminals(Table C) the figures include not only persons born in theIrish Free State or Northern Ireland, but also persons bornelsewhere if the father is Irish.   With this exception,and with the further exception of the statistics relatingto school children (Table E), the information in thisMemorandum  (and Tables A and E) relates only to personsborn in&apos;the Irish Free State or Northern Ireland.   Itdoes not relate to persons of Irish extraction in Scotland,whose ancestors may have settled there a generation ormore back.(&apos;Sgd.)   m.  ADAMSON .21st July, 1930.

By the Irish Free State (ConsequentialAdaptation of Enactments) Order 1923, warrantsauthorising the removal to the Irish Free State ofpaupers born there can no longer be obtained byScottish loor Law Authorities.  On the other hand the position as regards Northern Ireland remains-unchanged - that is,  paupers oan, as before, be re-moved by statutory -process from Scotland to Unionswithin Northern Ireland.
