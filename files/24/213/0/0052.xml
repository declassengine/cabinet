There is no general statistical information onthis point.   Attention was directed to it in the enquiries into maternal death made by the Maternal Mortality Committee,and is referred to in the Committee1 s forthcoming Report.Out of 1,815 cases in which information was furnished as tosooial circumstances, 1,256 (69$) were described as &quot;well-to-do&quot;, 439 (24$) as &quot;poor&quot; and 120 (6.6$) as &quot;destitute.&quot;( c)  according to attendance rejBpeotively of doctors and midwives            No statistical information is available on this .point.   It is not practicable&apos;to separate cases of maternaldeath under these two headings, as all abnormal&quot;and complicatedcases, whether primarily attended by a midwife or not, mustbe placed under the care of a doctor.(&amp;)  according to domiciliary or institutional attendance.            There is no general statistical information on thispoint, and the Maternal Mortality Committee found that no useful comparison as to relative death rates could be made onaccount of the very large number of cases admitted to hospital
on account of abnormality, as well as a good many admittedbecause difficult labour was foreseen during pregnancy.Certain information supplied to the Maternal MortalityCommittee from1 trie records of the Ministry of Health may bequot e d.The figures from 111 institutions making returns to theMinistry of Health were summarised for the five years 1924-28inclusive.   During that period 94 ,711 maternity cases wereadmitted to these institutions, with a maternal mortalityrate of approximately 4.5 per 1D00 births, as compared withthe rate for the whole country during these five years of 4.13(e) According to Age.            The following information is  taken from the  text of the Registrar general s statistical reports for Englandand Wales for the year 1927 (published 1929).Allages     15-     20-     25-     30-     35-     40-   45 and upwards  2,690      64    383     668     672    568     293      42              2.4   14.2    24.8    25.0   21.1    10.9     1.6                                                               a.             It will be seen that 66.4$ of the deaths were under the age of 35.
