MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  SECRETARY FOR  THE  COLONIES.     A DIFFICULT situation has been created in the Island by the incursion of the Roman Catholic Church into its temporal affairs.  The international aspect of this problem  has  been  dealt with  in the  Command  Paper  recently  presented  to Parliament by the Secretary of State  for Foreign Affairs.  I now wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to the domestic and constitutional reactions which it has produced in Malta.     These are so serious as to make it  desirable that, as a purely temporary measure, the Maltese  Constitution should be  suspended and Crown  Colony government established.  I am convinced, after a careful examination of the problem, which has now persisted  in an acute stage for many weeks, that it has become urgently neces- sary  for  His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt this course, and I  accordingly  seek the authority of the Cabinet to  take the necessary steps.     The  position is  briefly  as follows :  In 1921 Malta was  given a dyarchical constitution, under which, while matters involving Imperial interests were reserved to His Majesty&apos;s Government,  the  control of domestic matters was transferred  to a popularly elected Parliament.   This constitution,  which worked  satisfactorily for some years, is now threatened with a breakdown owing to the attempt of the Roman Catholic hierarchy to dictate to the electors the manner in which they should vote. This  action arises from the strong opposition of the Roman Catholic authorities to the policy and personality of Lord Strickland, the leader of the Constitutional party, which is now in power.   In April last, the local Parliament, which was approaching the expiration  of its triennial period, was dissolved, and preparations were made for a General Election to be held in May.   The.  priests  thereupon threw themselves into an  electoral  campaign in opposition to Lord Strickland&apos;s party, and the Maltese bishops issued a joint pastoral letter  the effect of which was  to declare that all persons who voted for that party would be guilty of &quot; mortal sin.&quot;    This letter, together with several similar attempts  by the clergy to exercise undue  influence on  the  electorate, provoked considerable public feeling.   The Governor, General Sir  John Du  Cane, considered  that  to  allow  the  elections to proceed in  such an  atmosphere would involve  the risk of serious  disorder.   I accordingly gave my  sanction  to  his proposal that he should invoke his reserved powers and postpone  it.   This  step was taken on the 3rd May,  and efforts were at once initiated by the  Foreign Office to get the Vatican to issue instructions to the Maltese hierarchy to restore to  the electorate their freedom of choice, and to make a fair election possible.  These efforts have met with no success.                               j    I  carefully examined, in  consultation  with the  Governor, the  possibility of allowing the election to proceed  in order to  give the Maltese people a chance of finding a solution of the difficulty within the framework of their constitution.  The Governor has now strongly advised against the adoption of this course.  He considersthat in the present inflamed state of  public feeling,  and during  the heat of  the summer, the holding of  a General Election would  be accompanied by seriousdisturbances.                                                                            B    In the meantime,however, the constitutional position has become very anomalous.Parliament has been dissolved, the elections  have been indefinitely postponed by  the       f21229]                                                                           j
exercise of the reserved power, but, meanwhile, Lord Strickland&apos;s Ministry remains in office.   Both the  Governor and I see the strongest objections to allowing this position  to endure.   Lord  Strickland&apos;s Government  derives its authority fromparliamentary institutions, and it appears to be constitutionally quite  improper toallow it to remain indefinitely in office when the normal working of those institutionshas been suspended by Imperial intervention.  It is obviously undesirable that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should invoke its reserved powers to keep  a particular partyin local politics in office.   To do so would be to place Lord Strickland in the positionof an extra-parliamentary dictator, and expose  His Majesty&apos;s Government to thecharge of partisan interference.     I therefore propose that, as a purely temporary measure, the constitution shouldbe suspended, and that  direct control should be assumed  by the Governor.   I am advised that legal sanction for this step can be obtained by prerogative legislation,and  I propose to submit  the  necessary draft Instruments to His Majesty in council as early as possible.  The matter is one  of some  urgency, as apart from the dangerof disorder if the present state of things is allowed to continue,  it is necessary forHis  Majesty&apos;s Government to arm itself with powers  to validate a series of lawspassed by the Maltese Legislature, the validity of which, for technical reasons, is atpresent being impugned in the Maltese  Courts.   It is expected  that judgment  onthe matter will be given on the 23rd June, and if it is adverse, considerable confusionwill  be caused, which, in the absence of  a local Parliament,  His  Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment must take power to remedy, in order to allow the administration to be carried on.    Lord Strickland arrives  in London from Malta this evening;  and I  have agreedto see  him  (with Sir A.  Bartolo,  Minister  for Education) to-mbrrow  (Tuesday)morning.   He  will doubtless strongly object to  the proposed action; but I  see  no practicable alternative.    The reception given to the recent Command Paper shows that the action takenby His Majesty&apos;s Government in the negotiations with the Vatican has commandedgeneral public support in this country.   It appears to me that there will be a goodParliamentary case for the further step of temporarily suspending the constitution.It can be defended as a measure which His Majesty&apos;s Government have been  forcedto take with the greatest reluctance owing to  the action of the Vatican, and  as onewhich they are anxious to terminate as soon as normal conditions can be  restored.P.Colonial Office, June 18. 1930.
