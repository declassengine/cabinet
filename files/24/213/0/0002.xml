DANGER  TO BE APPREHENDED.     SINCE THE REVOLUTION OF 1911, CHINA HAS BEEN IN A STATE OF CHAOS AND CIVIL WAR, which reached A CLIMAX DURING THE  PAST THREE YEARS.   NOMINALLY, THE KUOMINTANG nationalist party NOW CONTROLS ALL CHINA PROPER, BUT  THE  PRESENT LEADERS  OF THE PARTY ARE SERIOUSLYTHREATENED                          -     (I) BY EXTREMISTS WITHIN THEIR OWN PARTY ;    (II) BY A COMBINATION OF NORTHERN  WAR LORDS, WHO WISH TO REMAIN IN POWER IN THEIR           OWN PROVINCES AND OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE PARTY.     HITHERTO, THE PRESENT  LEADERS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEALT WITH BOTH THESE DANGERS, largely by WHOLESALE BRIBERY.   THE TIME IS APPROACHING, HOWEVER, WHEN, IF THEY WISH TO REMAININ CONTROL, THEY WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE TO FIGHT THEIR  OPPONENTS.  WHEN THIS FRESHOUTBREAK OF CIVIL WAR OCCURS, BRITISH NATIONALS  WILL BE FACED  WITH THE USUAL DANGER OFMOLESTATION  BY DEFEATED  OR MUTINOUS  CHINESE  SOLDIERS FROM BOTH SIDES IN THE CIVIL WARAREAS.-   \  1         &quot; -     THE RECENT UNILATERAL  DENUNCIATION OF EXTRA-TERRITORIALITY BY THE NANKING GOVERNMENTHAS GIVEN RISE TO  APPREHENSIONS OF THE SPREAD  OF A FURTHER WAVE OF ANTI-FOREIGN FANATICISMTHROUGHOUT CHINA, IN THE EVENT OF ATTEMPTS BEING MADE TO. PUT THE DENUNCIATION INTO FORCE.INCIDENTS ARE LIKELY TO  OCCUR THROUGH  CHINESE AGENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTING TOIMPOSE ILLEGAL TAXES, TO ARREST, TO CARRY OUT DOMICILIARY VISITS, &amp;C, UPON BRITISH NATIONALS.THE RECENT ARREST BY CHINESE POLICE OF A BRITISH NAVAL OFFICER IN HANKOW ILLUSTRATES THE sort of INCIDENT THAT MAY BE EXPECTED.    &apos;,     IN VIEW OF THE ABSENCE OF A STABLE GOVERNMENT, ADMINISTERING THE COUNTRY through an EFFICIENT AND INCORRUPTIBLE CIVIL SERVICE  AND DEPENDING  ULTIMATELY FOR, ITS  AUTHORITY ONA WELL-ORGANIZED NATIONAL ARMY, IT IS AT PRESENT QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO  FORESEE ANY END TO THEPRESENT DISTURBED CONDITION OF CHINA.   INDEED, THE VAST DIFFERENCES OF RACE, LANGUAGE ANDGENERAL OUTLOOK BETWEEN THE INHABITANTS  OF THE  VARIOUS PARTS  OF THIS ENORMOUS COUNTRYRENDER THE FORMATION  OF   EITHER  A  REAL NATIONAL ARMY OR A&quot; STABLE GOVERNMENT HIGHLYUNLIKELY, AT LEAST  FOR A GENERATION, POSSIBLY FOR LONGER.

                   2. AREAS IN WHICH PROTECTION IS  REQUIRED.     The two dangers to which British nationals  are  likely to  be exposed  are thereforemolestation by mutinous Chinese soldiers and a  recrudescence of anti-foreign agitation,leading perhaps to acts of violence against the person.   In order to appreciate themilitary  commitments entailed  in  the  protection of our  nationals from these dangers,it  is necessary  first  to  examine  the  location  of   the  scattered British  communities in China.     Appendix A to this memorandum&quot;  gives the principal places which contain  Britishcommunities and the  approximate number of British  subjects at  each place.   From  this it will be seen that from the point  of view of population, the order of importance  is thefollowing :               1.  Shanghai...     ...    ...   9,300 British subjects.              2.  Tientsin  ...     ...    ...    680 British subjects.              3.  Peking  ...     ...    ...    300 British subjects.              4.  Canton (Shameen)     ...    700 Europeans.     It has been pointed out (see CCI (30), 1st Meeting)  that approximately 70 per cent.of the British property in China is  concentrated at Shanghai, Hankow and  Tientsin, andas regards the value of the British  trade passing through  the  British communities inChina it  would seem, according to the latest figures available, that the&apos; order of importance.is as follows  :                   Shanghai, Tientsin, Canton, Hankow.     Hong Kong, being a British possession, is not included in the above estimates, but itmust not be overlooked that  a large  portion  of the  British trade  with  China  passesthrough  that port, and that the population of Hong Kong, according  to the latest  figuresavailable, is  approximately   874,000,  the protection  of  which is a direct  british responsibility.     It has  been shown  that  British lives and  property in  China  may at any time be threatened by defeated soldiery, brigands and mobs, and it is natural that a rabble of thiscomposition would be attracted by the chief centres of wealth,  where the potentialities ofloot are greatest.   Consequently, apart  from Hong Kong, the protection of  British lives and property at  Shanghai,  Tientsin, Peking,  Canton and  Hankow  would  seem to be amatter for prior consideration in the case of serious threats to British nationals.     It will be  seen from Appendix  A  that  Canton  (Shameen)  can be reached  bycruisers  at high water ordinaiy spring  tides, and if this  implies that once at  Shameen a cruiser can lie off the Concession for any length of time subject to the limitation that she could  only  be relieved  every  fortnight, the situation  appears comparable  with that at hankow, where a cruiser can afford protection subject to the fact that for four  months ofthe year  no relief can be effected.      3.  NATURE OF  PROTECTION TO BE  AFFORDED  AND LIMITATION OF MILITARY                                   COMMITMENTS.     With regard to the  nature of the protection  afforded  and the means  employed, it waspointed  out by the Chiefs of Staff in April,  1927 (C.I.D. Paper No. 788-B,  para.  9) that&quot;whereas a warship  can at any time Avithdraw from  a  locality where  it is temporarilyposted without any  loss of  prestige being  involved, this is not the case when  troopsspecifically allotted for protective purposes have to be withdrawn.&quot;     It is unnecessary to enlarge upon the magnitude of a military operation  for the relief of a beleaguered British garrison at Canton, or  at Hankow many hundreds of miles upthe River-Yangtse.   It  is for this reason that  the policy hitherto recommended  by theChiefs of Staff has been approved  by the Government of the day, namely, to avoid the dispersal of our military forces or  the  acceptance of fresh military commitments.  Thispolicy was  primarily adopted  in  connection with a proposal in March, 1927,  for theoccupation of the Bogue forts (Canton) by military forces and was reaffirmed  in April oEthat&apos;year in regard to the defence of  the  Concession at Amoy and  of our interests atSwatow  (C.I.D. Papers No..784-B  and 788-B).     Further, the recommendations of the Chiefs of  Staff for  the  utilization of military,forces in circumstances such as these have  been limited by the proviso that  the troops could  be spared  from their  primary duties  at the main centres in China, and that theirdetachment  should be .essentially  temporary.   (C.I.D.  Papers No. 794-B, para. 4, and974-B, para. 7.)   The intention, therefore,  has  been  that, except  at  Shanghai, Tientsinand Peking,  the use of military forces in China should be limited to their employment asan  augmentation of, and supplementary to, naval landing parties.
     The foregoing considerations, therefore, emphasize the, fapt that our direct military commitments in China should be limited to the protection of British nationals in Peking,Tientsin and Shanghai, subject  to the  condition that the  maintenance of an adequategarrison for the defence of Hong Kong is always essential.               4.  EXTENT TO WHICH OTHER NATIONS CAN CO-OPERATE.     It is unlikely that the dangers facing British subjects will not be equally shared bythe nationals of other Powers which have similar problems in China, and it may be of value to examine the areas in which those interests lie.                                    (a) America.     The United States of America have comparatively small interests in  China beyondnumerous and well-organized mission stations.  Their trade amounts to only about 14 percent, of the total foreign trade of China, but is growing.  There are available in Shanghaiabout 1,100 American- marines,  and in North  China about 1,300 soldiers and marines.The American policy is to evacuate American citizens from places  of danger  to places where they can be adequately protected.   It is known, however, that United States forces will not interfere  to  uphold treaty rights,  and  will not co-operate in any internationalscheme for defending the International Settlement at Shanghai from outside aggression.                                     &quot;(b)  France.     French interests are  mainly centred in the French Concessions at Shanghai, and inthe province of Yunnan bordering on  French Indo-China.  Here she has large railway,mineral, commercial and  financial interests.  The French may be relied upon to defendtheir interests firmly, and full  discretion  as to the protection of French nationals rests with the French Minister to China.     About 3,600  French troops are available in China, of whom  1,200 are defending theFrench Concession at Shanghai, and about 2,200 are in the Peking-Tientsin area, 180 at hankow and 90 at Shameen.     Reinforcements up to 3 battalions  from Tongking are available within 8-10 days, if required.                                      (c)  Japan.     Apart from her vast interests in Manchuria (in which the port of Dairen has nowbeen developed to the extent that its volume of trade exceeds that of all other ports inChina, with the exception of  Shanghai), Japan&apos;s  primary concern is with her  largecommitments in  Shantung.   She also  retains  her Concessions  at Hankow and Tientsinand has a considerable commercial stake in the International Settlement at  Shanghai.     About 800 Japanese troops are available  in North China, and a landing party ofabout  1,300  sailors is available in  Shanghai,  500 of the latter  being  earmarked forHankow if required.   The Japanese will  give no guarantee as to their probable action ;it  may  confidently be  anticipated, however, that, in the event of trouble, the Japanesewill take their full share in any schemes for the defence of either -the International Settle-ment at Shanghai or of the Peking-Tientsin area.  Further, the propinquity  of Japan to China makes the  provision of reinforcements  for China  a comparatively simple  matter, p.g., Japanese reinforcements can reach Shanghai in two or three days from Kyushu, or Tientsin from Dairen or Mukden in less than 24 hours.      From the foregoing it will be seen  that for the protection of foreign nationals in China the Japanese and French are likely to take a strong line, and  that this action maybe confidently expected in the  Peking-Tientsin area, in Shanghai, and to a lesser extent, perhaps, in Hankow and Canton, whereas  any dependence upon the support of the United States  forces is likely to prove illusory.   In the north of China, therefore,  it is reasonable to rely to some extent  upon prompt and suitable measures being adopted by Japan, and to allot to that area the minimum  British garrison which is compatible with our responsibilities - ties under the Treaty obligations.  In the south of China, Great Britain must provide adequate protection for her nationals situated in the colony of Hong Kong,  the security of which, as our most easterly naval base, must also be ensured.      With regard to Shanghai,  which is an International Concession, it is essential that all the Powers involved should be in a position  to safeguard their nationals and, Avith the possible exception of the  United States  of America, the  Powers  chiefly concerned are already in a position to afford this protection.  It must not be overlooked, however, that the foreign population of Shanghai is a trading community operating on the largest scale and that ultimately this trade can be carried on only with the willing co-operation of the     (5078)
Chinese people.   While, therefore, it  is necessary for-the prestige of  these communities-that their Governments should be in a position  to  guarantee the safety of their nationals,any permanent form  of occupation would  naturally be regarded  by the Chinese as anattempt to dominate China.   It&apos; is  essential, therefore, that any occupation of Shanghaiby foreign troops should be frankly of a temporary nature, though arrangements shouldbe made, in view of the uncertainty of the future situation, for sending troops to. Shanghaishould another emergency arise.                  5.  INADEQUACY OF THE GARRISON  PRIOR TO 1927.     Though in 1914 the British garrison in China amounted to 6 battalions which werecharged with the defence of Hong Kong  and  Tientsin, this garrison was  reduced, byreason of the Great War and  other causes, to 3 battalions, this being the figure at which it stood at the beginning of 1927.  In January of that year following the successful advanceof the Cantonese  armies.to  the Yangtse, there occurred what is known as the Hankowincident.   Simultaneously,  the  Southerners  continued their advance down the Yangtsewith the object of seizing Shanghai, and, since it appeared to H.M.  Government that the safety of our nationals in the International Settlement in Shanghai would be endangeredshould the victorious Nationalist armies enter that city, it was decided  on 17th january to send a defence force to China.     The  gravity  of  the emergency  which  caused this decision,  to  be taken is bestexemplified by quoting from  the instructions given to the commander  of the ShanghaiDefence Force, which stated that his force was &quot; to protect British&apos; lives and property in shanghai against any Chinese military  forces that  may endanger them, and to prevent,by force  if necessary,  the entry of any Chinese military forces into the InternationalSettlement.&quot;     By  the  end of  May, 1927,  it  had  been  found necessary to despatch additionalreinforcements  to China, the garrison of which was thereby raised to 20  battalions of infantry together with 2 brigades of artillery and other troops, and included a contingent of 4 battalions specially earmarked for service in Peking and Tientsin should the  courseo  the civil war endanger our compatriots in those two places.  Owing, to the fact that other nations were beginning to show a readiness to take a share in the defence of their nationals in North China, and since the  Nationalist advance came to a stop before Peking;and Tientsin  were  in  danger,  these last  4 battalions did not proceed beyond  Hong-Kong.  It will, however, be  seen  that it is not so very long ago that a reinforcement of4  additional  battalions for the Tientsin Peking  area  was contemplated, and, but forfortuitous circumstances, would have- been necessary.     With regard to Shanghai, the maximum force employed in its defence was 3 brigades,or 12 battalions of infantry.  It was subsequently found that no formed bodies of chinese troops showed any inclination to attack places garrisoned  by our forces, whose presenceproved also to be an  adequate  deterrent  to outbreaks of  anti-foreign fanaticism.   Ourprompt action in affording  military protection to the threatened point had had its desiredeffect on the Chinese mentality, and, with the move northwards of the civil war, the morestable conditions in Shanghai enabled a  gradual  and continued reduction to  be made inour forces stationed there.  In addition, the Municipality have organized a ring of fixeddefences round the perimeter  of the Settlement, and our garrison there to-day amounts to-but two infantry battalions.  .   A consideration  of the  events in  China since  1926 leads to the conclusion that&apos;a comparatively small show of military force promptly applied  is adequate to deal with-dangers arising purely out of  mob violence ;  and it is further a matter for reflectionwhether, had an adequate reinforcement for Shanghai existed in  China in 1927, it wouldhave  been necessary  to send  a  large  and costly  expedition  from  England  whichhad to be  equipped oh a scale  sufficient to deal  with eventualities which might ariseduring the six weeks&apos; voyage to the Far East.  The  main conclusion,  however, to which one is forced  is that we had, since the war,  been taking an unwarranted  risk in the far east, where our garrisons had been reduced to  a level which rendered  them impotent tomeet  the more extended liabilities forced on them by the trend of the civil wars in Chinatowards our Treaty Ports and Settlements.           6. NECESSITY FOR REINFORCEMENTS  BEING AVAILABLE  IN  CHINA.     The British  post-war garrison  of 3  battalions distributed between Hong   kong and Tientsin, which proved to be insufficient at the beginning of  1927, would clearly be equally inadequate  to deal  with another emergency  arising in Tientsin or  in Shanghaialter  the removal  of our  troops  from that city.  I see  no reason why such another
emergency should not again arise, but it is impossible to foretell where exactly reinforce-..ments may again be required  at short notice.  I consider, therefore, that  a  brigade of 4battalions is the minimum  which  should  be readily available to meet such a situation,whether in North China or in  Shanghai,- and that our  Far Eastern garrisons should be calculated with a view to enabling this reinforcement to be made available without at thesame time denuding our obligatory garrisons in Hong Kong and Tientsin.                           7. GARRISON  OS&quot; HONG KoNG.   . Reference has already been  made to the  necessity for the adequate defence of purnationals at Hong Kong.   The proximity of  this British Colony to the areas in China inwhich it may  become necessary for us  to afford military  protection to our compatriotsmakes it a peculiarly suitable locality- in  which to station reserves who may be requiredfor this eventuality. The solution of the dual problem of  making our naval base  secureand  of  safeguarding our  interests elsewhere  in  China  appears,  therefore,  to,  lie in maintaining at Hong Kong a reserve of  infantry which will be adequate to deal with any future emergency comparable with that  which faced us in January, 1927,  and will, at thesame time, be  strong enough to provide  the security to which it is entitled as a naval base.    In present conditions I consider that  this garrison should be 3 battalions of infantry,and that it should be raised to at least 5 battalions when we withdraw  the 2 battalionsnow in Shanghai.          8. ULTIMATE DISTRIBUTION  OE THE  BRITISH GARRISON IN CHINA.    I consider, therefore, that the ultimate distribution  of the British garrison in  Chinaafter the  evacuation of  Shanghai should be :               Hong Kong       ...    ...     ...     ...  5  battalions.              Peking Tientsin...    ...     ...     ...  1  battalion.                                 - 9-, CONCLUSIONS.     (i)  There is  every  probability  that  the present disturbed condition  of China willcontinue  for many years, during which time it will be necessary for us to  continue to bein a position to afford protection to British nationals in that country.    (ii)  Protection should  be afforded to British  communities situated at- places  in thefollowing order of  priority :               Shanghai, Tientsin and Peking, Canton  (Shameen), Hankow.    Of the above, the  occupation of Shanghai should be temporary  and should ceasewhenever political  conditions have improved  sufficiently  to  warrant  the withdrawal o our troops to  Hong Kong.  The  protection  afforded  at Canton and Hankow should beby means of naval forces, in order to obviate fresh military  commitments  which  would inevitably become unlimited and necessitate an increased garrison in China.    (hi)  The post-war garrison of Tientsin and Hong Kong,  &quot;a total  of 3 battalions,was shown by the  events  of 1927 to be  clearly inadequate for  any purpose other thanthe security of those places under normal  conditions.   To enable incipient trouble to bonipped in the  bud at Shanghai or in  Tientsin, and to obviate  the necessity  for againsending  considerable forces to the Far  East at  short notice,  a minimum garrison of6  battalions&apos;  is  necessary in  China.    This  would  make   available  a  mobile  forceof 4 battalions  for desjjatch  to  Shanghai or to North China  for the protection of ournationals in any future emergency, and at  the same time  would leave minimum obligatorygarrisons in Hong Kong and Tientsin.     (iv)  In the Peking Tientsin area, it is reasonable to rely upon Japanese  assistanceto foreign nationals, and  a minimum British garrison  of 1  battalion  should, therefore,be  permanently  maintained in  that area.  This is a  commitment under the protocol of 1901.     (v)  For the defence of Hong Kong  and for  the provision of a reserve  for use else-where  in China, the existing  garrison is totally inadequate.   As soon  as  Shanghai isevacuated, the permanent  infantry garrison should be at least 5 battalions, of which 1may be Indian.

Peking Tientsin    ...    ...     ...     ...  1 battalion. ,     t     (vii) In  making these definite recommendations, I desire  to  emphasize that this estimate of our future garrison in China is based upon the following  contention :          The  smallest  detached unit which  can  usefully and  safely be employed on     protective duties is  one company, and our experience of the Nanking detachment,     which, after, continual representations by the General Staff, was  not withdrawn until     alter a period of 10 months, shows that, once a small military force is installed as.a     protective measure,  every possible  political argument will  be  used to prevent its     withdrawal.   Should we accept the policy of providing protection at even a limited     number of smaller ports,  we  should  be faced with a  series of  similar protracted     occupations, which will involve the  retention in China of a larger number of troops     than I have,.up to date, considered to be necessary.
