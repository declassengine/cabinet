B cbs. 3?.ICP. 227 (30)Copy No,CAB I IT E T,THE ATTITUDE OS&apos; THE OOVERlTIiEITT TO INDUSTRIAL            Iffi-OBG-AlTISATlOIT,-Hemorandum by; the Secretary of State, for          the DominionsT1.          i:ty colleagues will  recall  that,  ;/hen I  was            Lord -Privy Seal, the need for  industrial reconstruction on a wide scale  v/as brought  to mynotice, and representations were made  to me  that progress in this matter depended largely on  finance.I therefore discussed the -problem v. ith those in  theCity and as a result of these discussions I  was  ableto announce the readiness of the City  to give financialadvice and backing to sound schemes  of industrial re-construction.  I was later able to announce  in april the formation of the Bankers Industrial-DevelopmentCompany, which is representative of  the City at  large,for the express purpose of receiving and consideringschemes of rationalisation.  In these  circumstancesindustrialists have naturally consulted me  in connectionwith plans for re-organisation  and I have been able tohelp them by advice and by acting as a link  betweenthem and the City.  The work oi* industrial re-construction is however still in its - early  stages;  incertain industries the task has hardly been  begun.2.          My policy as Lord Privy  Seal was endorsed            by the Cabinet; &apos;;he work I was doing inconnection with industrial re-organisation  falls,
 -ithowever, somewhat outside the scope of my presentpost, and although the newly formed Panel ofMinisters is actively engaged on the consideration ofunemployment generally, they are naturally concernedvery largely with its more immediate aspects whilst the question of industrial re-organisation has to hedetermined in the light of future development.  It isnecessary therefore lor the Cabinet to decide whetherthis work is to continue,3.           Of the importance of industrial re-            construation I personally have no doubts.Until industry is profitable it will never, whether in private or public ownership, be able to give asatisfactory volume of employment, and there are wide areas over which there is little prospect of this untilcomprehensive reconstruction has been effected.  Inthe Lancashire cotton trade, for instance, there are over 3,000 firms struggling for existence against highlyorganised foreign competition, and while the presentacute phase of the depression is due to world causes,the Report of the Committee which examined the conditionsin this trade under the Chairmanship of the homeSecretary makes It only too clear that there is no alternative to rationalisation, except continued decay,Some loss of employment must be faced, but it can belimited by rationalisation; on the other hand if things are left to slide the prospects of the operatives areblaok indeed.  while the Cotton trade is the most extremeexample of the need for rationalisation, it is far from being the only one.   The Report on the Iron &amp; SteelIndustry stresses the need ior further amalgamations;and in the *.&apos;ool Textile Industry re-organisation cannotbe safely delayed much longer.  These are the most
important tasks ahead, but there are others to which I need not refer here.4.          It is important that we - should realise what are the alternatives before us.   The choice does not lie between rationalisation and the continuance of theexisting organisation - or rather lack of organisation -In Industry.  Industry is coming to realise more and more that it must rationalise if it is to survive at all, andthe process has already commenced.   In some indsutriesit has gone a long way, in others it has hardly started,but the&apos; movement is universal.  We cannot set the clockback.  The question before us as a Government is whether we are to help rationalisation with advice and co-operation^guiding its development and minimising the difficultiesof what must in any case be a most painful process, orwhether we are to stand aside while the process is prolongedwith much unnecessary dislocation and loss, and all thesuffering that will be involved,5.     There is much that can be done to remove the inertia       and the personal difficulties which ofton obstruct the initiation of plans for re-organisation, both by appeals from the public platform and in private conference withindustrialists,  &apos; further, the announcements which I havemade of the readiness of the City to help and of thefacilities available have naturally led industrialists to expect us to provide a link between them and the City.Experience has shown that it is not enough to preach theabstract doctrine of re-organisation.  Someone must beavailable to answer the business man, when he asks - asthe more hard-headed business men always do - for guidance as to  the type of scheme which is likely to commend itselfto the financial interests and the general nature of theterms  of which new capital may be available.                        -3-
6,          At the same time we must realise that our            association with rationalisation may exposeus to criticism, whire we can expect little popularityfrom it; no Government and no Minister can hope for anything but criticism and probably misrepresentation.The -process of rationalising an industry is unavoidablypainful to all connected with it, and if we are associatedwith the process in the popular mind, the attendanttroubles will probably be laid at our door.  Shareholdersand creditors may blame us for losses which have in factalready been made though not realised; and workpeoplewill blame us for unemployment which has become inevitable through the growing difficulties of their employers.  It is the criticism from the latter quarterwhich may be expected to cause us the most difficulty.7.          The view that rationalisation causes            unemployment is not one that can beaccepted without examination.   it is perfectly truethat in the course of rationalisation it is oftennecessary to close down works or parts of works.  Onthe other hand, rationalisation usually involves re-equipment, which means increased employment elsewhere;more important still, it will generally be the onlyalt amative to indue-trial decay, with a still greaterdecline in employment.  Rationalisation may be the only way of making industry once more remunerative, and it isonly by making industry remunerative that a basis for future expansion can be created.   I believe thatrationalisation is in the best interests of employment.8,          Nevertheless there are already cases where            the first effects of rationalisation are seen in the closing of wades and mills and therecertainly will be more,  for instance the Shipbuilding                      -4-
Industry is suffering from a productive capacity greatly in excess of its probable requirements.  In order tosecure an orderly and considered curtailment ofredundant facilities a Company (the national ShipbuildersSecurity limited) has been launched to buy up and scrapsurplus yards.  The resulting concentration of work andsavings in overhead charges will be most beneficial, butthere may be at least an apparent displacement of labour.Ixi such cases the workpeople concerned will naturallyascribe their unemployment to rationalisation, and wecannot hope to avert criticism by references to futureprosperity and increased employment elsewhere.  Claimswill be put forward that some special provision shouldbe made for these oases,90          I do not propose to discuss here how far            it may be either practicable or desirableto single out for special treatment these whoseunemployment is ascribed to rationalisation; but I wishto make it quite clear that there is no prospect thatfunds will be available for this purpose either fromthe industries which arc in need of reconstruction orfrom these who may &apos;supply new money to reconstruct them.It is true that certain firms have made some provisionfor workpeople displaced by measures of re-organisation;but these have been prosperous concerns.  industries which are in such straits that they cannot continue to employ their workpeople can have no funds to pay thosethey are no longer able to employ; while the financialhouses to whom industry must lock for new money willhave to reimburse themselves by inviting the investing
public to  subscribe now capital, and they cannot thereforebe  expected to  supply money for purposes which are notlegally obligatory and which bring no return on thecapital invested.   Further; it has to be remembered thatwhile we may be able to guide the course of industrial reconstruction by co-operation and advice, we have no powers of  compulsion;  the interests concerned are free to  apply their  funds as they will,10,          Another cause of criticism may be the             apparent slowness of progress and lack of early tangible results.  Very complete arrangements havebeen made  for the provision of financial advice and backing,but it is  not in the lack of these things that the mainobstacles  have been found to lie.   Where industry has grown up on a strongly Individualistic basis, it may bedifficult  to find an outstanding figure to take the lead and to secure the necessary co-operation.   Even whenactive negotiations start, the obstacles to be surmountedare formidable.   iVhere industry has ceased to beprofitable, a drastic writing down of the assets ofproprietors and creditors will bo necessary if the re-constructed undertaking Is to have any real chance ofsuccess,    It is, however,  natural that tho present ownersshould be  slow to realise the full extent to which their assets have depreciated;  and, even if an agreed value forthe whole  of the assets can be reached, it will still benecessary  to secure the agreement of debenture holders,&apos;creditors,  bankersHand shareholders to the proportions inwhich any  losses are to fall on each class of interest.K. Heavy bank overdrafts are a common feature of those  cases.
It was doubtless for reasons such as these, that thw governor of the Bank of England, in a statement made to the press inconnection with the announcement of the formation of theBankers Industrial Development Company, warned them that&quot;they did not expect results in a few weeks or a fewmonths; it is going to be a long process&quot;.11.          Serious as are the difficulties which ourmay involve, I do not feel that ,ve should be justifiedin standing aside for this reason from a task of suchnational importance.  I should, however, like the Cabinetto decide whether this view is to be accepted and actedupon,12.          If it is, it remains for the Cabinet also tois of course closely connected with that of the Board ofTrade; that Department &quot;was responsible for the steel and Cotton Committees and has in this and other wayscollected a large amount of material arid information.Although, therefore (having regard to the importance ofmaintaining the personal contacts that had been made)I had expressed to the Prime Minister my willingness tocontinue to undertake this work for the time being - ofcourse In consultation with the Board of Trade and theMinistry of Labour - I new suggest to the Cabinet thatthey should decide to entrust it to the President ofthe Board of Trade;  there being available to him, if he wishes, the staff that has hitherto been assisting me,I, too, should be glad to give assistance.association with industrial reconstructiondecide how the work is to be directed.It(It Id.)
