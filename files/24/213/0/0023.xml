Public Works  Facilities Bill.               NOTES ON  CLAUSES.                      CLAUSE  1.    This clause proposes  to  provide  new procedure, in place  of the familiar procedure by private Bill, for con-ferring on  local authorities  and statutory  undertakerspowers to  enable them to carry out works which  will contribute to the relief of  unemployment.    Local authorities and statutory undertakers will beable to initiate this procedure at any time, whereas underthe ordinary private Bill  legislation it is necessary for acopy  of the  Bill to  be deposited at  the  ParliamentaryOffices not  later than the  17th December in any year.    Under the procedure  prescribed by the  clause, localauthorities and statutory  undertakers will submit to theappropriate Minister (defined in clause  7) a  draft ordercontaining  the provisions  which, if they were proceeding by private  Bill, would be contained in the clauses of that bill.  Before laying the draft  order before Parliament theMinister will require public  notice of it to be given inaccordance with the proviso to subsection (2)  of theclause. He will have power to modify the draft submittedto him both  before and after this notice has been  given,but if he makes modifications in consequence of objections raised after notice has been given, the local authority or statutory  undertakers  will be  required to  publish the modified draft in the same manner as  the original draft.    It is contemplated that when a draft  order  underthis section has been laid before  Parliament it will beconsidered  by a Joint Committee of both Houses and thatthe Joint Committee will hold any local or other inquirieswhich they  consider necessary.  This, however,  is  amatter to  be provided for by the Standing Orders ofParliament  and not by the  Bill.   It is suggested thatwhen the Bill is introduced there should  at the same time be circulated to Parliament  a  Memorandum containing a note as to  amendments  of the Standing Orders in con-nection. with orders  made under this clause which willbe desirable in order to complete this  procedure.    150-2               A
    Subsection  (3)  of  the  clause  gives  the Ministerpower to make such modifications in the draft order as may be necessary for giving effect to any amendments proposed by the  Parliamentary Committee  by whichthe draft has  been considered,  and  subsection (4) ofthe clause provides that the  order is to have effect only if  the  draft has been approved by a resolution of each house.  If  the Minister  omits to  give  effect to  any amendment proposed by the Parliamentary Committee,that will be a matter  which  Parliament will have toconsider  before deciding to approve the order.    It should be noted that  this procedure will not beavailable unless the appropriate Minister is satisfied     (a) that the works to be executed under the powers         proposed  to be  conferred by  the order  will         contribute to the relief of unemployment; and    (6) that the relief to unemployment will be expedited         by reason of the powers being  conferred  by         an order under  this  clause  instead  of by a         local or private Act or by an order confirmed         by an Act;  and    (c) that the  powers proposed  to  be  conferred  by         the order are such as are customarily conferred       . -  on local  authorities or statutory undertakers         by local or private  Acts;  and    (d) that the  powers  proposed to be conferred will         not enable the  local authority  or   statutory         undertakers to undertake functions of a  dif-         ferent nature  from those already within their         statutory powers.                   CLAUSE 2.    The purpose of this clause is to enable local authori-ties  and  statutory  undertakers   to  purchase  landcompulsorily for the objects named  in Part I of the first schedule to the Bill.    With two exceptions, the clause will provide merelya simplified and more expeditious procedure for obtainingpowers of compulsory purchase in cases where that power could  be obtained under the existing law by provisionalor other orders.   The two cases in which the power toauthorise  compulsory  purchase is actually  extendedare the provision of  aerodromes, and in London  theprovision pf open spaces  and public recreation grounds;
    Subsection  (3)  of  the  clause  gives  the Ministerpower to &apos; make such modifications in the draft order as may be necessary for giving effect to any amendments proposed by the  Parliamentary Committee  by whichthe draft has  been considered,  and  subsection (4) ofthe clause provides that the  order is to have effect only if  the  draft has been approved by a resolution of each house.  If  the Minister  omits to  give  effect to  any amendment proposed by the Parliamentary Committee,that will be a matter  which  Parliament will have toconsider  before deciding to approve the order.    It should be noted that  this procedure will not beavailable unless the appropriate Minister is satisfied     (a) that the works to be executed under the powers        proposed  to be  conferred by  the order  will         contribute to the relief of unemployment; and    (b) that the relief to unemployment will be expedited         by reason of the powers being  conferred  by         an order under  this  clause  instead  of by a        local or private Act or by an order confirmed         by an Act;  and    (c) that the  powers proposed  to  be  conferred by         the order are such as are customarily conferred       -  on local  authorities or statutory undertakers         by local or private  Acts;  and    (d) that the  powers  proposed to  be conferred will         not enable the  local authority  or   statutory         undertakers to undertake functions of a  dif-         ferent nature  from those already within their         statutory powers.                   CLAUSE 2.    The purpose of this clause is to enable local authori-ties  and  statutory  undertakers   to  purchase  landcompulsorily for the objects named in Part I of the first schedule to the Bill.    With two exceptions, the clause will provide merelya simplified and more expeditious procedure for obtainingpowers of compulsory purchase in cases where that power could be obtained under the existing law by provisionalor other orders.   The two cases in which the power toauthorise  compulsory  purchase is actually  extendedare the provision of  aerodromes, and in London  theprovision of open spaces  and public recreation grounds j
in these two cases,  there  is power at present only topurchase land by  agreement.    Subs.  (1) of  the clause  follows  very closely  therecommendations  of  Lord  Parmoor&apos;s Committee,  andapplies generally the provisions as to compulsory purchasewhich are operative under  the Housing Acts.   (the production-cedure contained  in  Part  II  of the First  Schedule tothis Bill is virtually the same as that contained in theSchedule to  the Housing  Bill  now  before parliament which, by the time this Bill is considered in Committee,will presumably have  been recently passed  by bothHouses.  Part III of the  Schedule re-enacts for  thispurpose a clause which has been  moved into the housing bill as a Government amendment.)    The first proviso to subs. (1) applies to  orders madeunder this section restrictions which by sections 103 to 105of the Housing Act, 1925, are imposed in respect of orders made under  that Act.  These sections as so appliedprovide,  in effect     (a) that  an order may  not  authorise  the com-         pulsory acquisition of commons and open spaces         unless the order has been confirmed  by Parlia-         ment, except where the order provides for giving         in exchange other land certified by the appro-         priate  Minister,   after   consultation   with  the         Minister  of  Agriculture and Fisheries, to be         equally advantageous;    (b) that  an order  is not to provide for  the com-         pulsory acquisition of land within a  prescribed         distance of  the Royal  Palaces or parks except         after consultation with the  Commissioners of         Works;    (c) that an order is not to provide for the compulsory         acquisition  of an ancient monument or other         object of archaeological interest.    The second proviso to subsection (1) reproduces aprovision as to &quot;betterment&quot;  which is contained insection 1  of the  Unemployment  (Relief Works)  Act,1920.   That  section  will be replaced by this clause ofthe Bill.    Subs.  (2) of the clause gives  a local authority or statutory undertakers  in  whose favour an  order  hasbeen made under subs. (1) power to enter any land which
 they are authorised by the order to acquire, after giving fourteen days&apos; notice to the owner and  occupier, but without making a deposit of the purchase  price which is required under the  Lands  Clauses  Act,  1845.   This follows the precedent of subs. (1)  of section  106 of the Housing Act, 1925.                      CLAUSE 3.     This  clause contains a  saving preventing the Bill being  used for  authorising the  compulsory acquisition of land belonging to  a local  authority, or to  a railway, dock, canal,  water or other public undertaking.  It goes on, however, to provide, in accordance with the recom- mendation of Lord Parmoor&apos;s Committee,  that an order made  under the BiU may authorise the  acquisition of easements  or rights of using  such land for any purposes connected with the purposes for which the order is made. These powers are likely to be required for the acquisition of highway easements over or under railways or canals.                      CLAUSE 4.     Clause 4 provides for some small amendments to section 2 of the Unemployment  Relief Works  Act, 1920, to meet points raised by the local authorities at recent conferences.     As regards the first amendment, there is no definition of &quot; arterial road &quot; in the Act of 1920, but the operation of this section of  the Act  has sometimes  been thought to be impeded by the  presence of this word.     As regards the second amendment, local authorities have in some cases, particularly in the North of England, been held up by the  difficulties  in  acquiring land which is fenced by  stone walls, it being suggested that such a wall is a building or structure within  the meaning of the proviso to  subs. (1) of section 2 of  the Act of 1920, and that, therefore, by reason of  that proviso, an  authority cannot under the section enter on  land upon  which the boundary fences happen to be walls.                      CLAUSE 5.    The purpose of this clause is to expedite, the procedure for making special orders under the Electricity  SupplyAct, 1919.  Under the Schedide  to  that Act the Minister
of Transport before confirming a special order made bythe  Electricity  Commissioners must  publish the  order and give not less than twenty-one days for the making of objections.  Upon  an objection being received,  theMinister must consider it and if he makes any amendment to meet the objection he is obliged to cause the amendedorder  to  be published in like manner  as the  originalorder.  This sometimes leads to unnecessary delay wherethe  amendments  made as the result of objections  areonly of a trifling nature; paragraph  (a) of the clauseproposes to make republication unnecessary.     Further, under a later proviso of  the Schedule tothe Act of 1919, if any objection is made to an order,the  Minister is  bound to cause a public inquiry to beheld unless the objection is either withdrawn or appearsto him to be frivolous.   There are sometimes cases inwhich  an objection, though  not altogether  frivolous,may be of such a character that the matter can reason-ably be dealt with without  a  local inquiry, and  paragraph  (6)  of the clause is designed to  make the holding of such an inquiry a matter within the  discretion ofthe Minister.     Since the clause was drafted the Ministry of Transporthave been consulted and as a result of the discussion itis proposed to make the clause go further by providingin effect that where the Minister of Transport is satisfiedthat the Electricity Commissioners, before submitting anorder  to  him, have  afforded full opportunity  for  themaking of objections and that no objections have beenmade except such as have been fully met, the procedurelaid down in the Schedule to the Act of 1919 shall not be applicable at all.                      CLAUSE 6.    This clause contains the  necessary definitions.  the definition of &quot; statutory undertakers &quot;  has  been taken from the recent Land Valuation Bill.                      CLAUSE 7.    A  copy of the Bill has  been sent to the legal secretary to the Lord Advocate in order that he maydraft  any necessary adaptations of  the  Bill  for thepurpose of its application to Scotland.
                      CLAUSE  8.    This clause, besides containing the short title  andother formal details,  provides  that the Bill shall cease to be in force after the end of December,  1933, unlessParliament continues  it by means of the Expiring laws continuance Act.
