SECRET.- APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN. AND GENERAL ...   . REPORT No. GO.PART I. -BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Imp k rial Affairs. -   . - ,.-Tlie gravity of the shipping situation in relation to Dominion affairs is made abundantly clear throughout this Report,Canada.The Speech from the Throne at the opening of-the thirteenth Parliament of the Dominion reflects a full appreciation of Canada&apos;s&quot; responsibility, as a partner-nation of the British Commonwealth, to see the Avar to a triumphant conclusion. The reference to the success of the Military Service Act should be noted. The work of the Parliamentary Session promises to be of interest and imj)ortance.The reference of Sir W. Laurier, in his first speech since the General. Election, to the Canadian Confederation, and other matters, should be considered in the light of recent contr\oversies in Quebec and the language difficulties in Ontario. His later speech on the Address gives some idea of his general attitude towards the neAA&apos; Government.The paragraphs in this Report relating to Pacifist propaganda and Tariff regulations are worth notice.Australian Comm on wealth.The further, action that is being taken by the Commonwealth Government in relation to shipbuilding and trade organisation shows that no steps are being neglected in pursuance of a vigorous policy in both directions. The attitude of the Common-wealth in regard to the wool question is indicative of entire confidence in the British authorities to safeguard Australian interests.Mr. Hughes&apos; pronouncement on Avar aims and the need of constructive effort instead of destructive criticism should be considered in connection with the observations in this Report upon the Australian political situation.The result of the  Queensland   Elections confirms the Labour Government in
power. The Government of the Independent Liberals in Victoria has resigned, and a new combination of Parties seems certain.South Africa.The Debate in the Union Parliament upon the Government Gold Mining areas is of interest, and it is noteworthy that General Botha did not treat the proposal to alter the-agreement as one involving-confidence in the Government.German Africa.The German scheme of economic penetration in Africa is further elucidated by Dr. Solf and Captain Perseus. The extracts given, in this Report may be of value hereafter. The German inventions with regard to Togoland are characteristic.G. G. A.March 21st, 1918.

PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND  AFRICA.h IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.&quot;Allied Protection of Fishing Vessels. In response to the invitation of the British Government to forward their views upon the subject of the protection of fishing-vessels on Newfoundland Banks (vide Report No. 59), the Canadian Government have telegraphed to enquire whether the Admiralty consider vessels armed with one 6-pounder and one 12-pounder are sufficient for patrol purposes, as no other ships would be available. The Canadian Government have also asked for information as to the representatives of French and United States&apos; interests who should be approached with regard to joint action.Tonnage for Australasian Trade. The Governments of the Australian Common-wealth and the Dominion of New Zealand have been informed that a re-arrangement of tonnage hitherto used in the Australasian trade is essential. It is pointed out that the British Government are 70,000 tons, in arrear of their commitments to the French Government, and owing to the loss of cattle during the Italian retreat, it is expected that large increases of meat into Italy will be necessary. While every opportunity will be taken to insure that Australia and New Zealand receive every available refrigerated steamer which is not required for a nearer source of supply, it is indicated that in National and Allied interests it is necessary that refrigerated tonnage should be used continuously for trade with the United States and Canada, in order to secure all supplies that are available there. It is added that meat and other supplies for the forces in Egypt and Salonika will continue to be mainly drawn from Australasia.CANADA.Meeting of the Neto Parliament. The Thirteenth Parliament of the Dominion was opened by the Governor-General on March I8th: In the morning of that day Mr. E. N. Rhodes was re-elected Speaker and the House then considered the Speech from the Throne.Speech from the Throne. The Governor-General in his Speech from the Throne referred to some of the outstanding matters that have recently affected the course of Canadian affairs. Dealing with the Military Service Act, the following passage occurred : &quot; Notwithstanding the greater delay than was anticipated in the operation &quot; of the Military Service Act, the necessary reinforcements to keep our forces at full &quot; strength have been provided, and for this purpose will be maintained in future.&quot; As to the matters with which the Canadian Parliament would be colled upon to deal, the following were mentioned by the Governor-General, viz., demobilisation and the training of returned soldiers, Civil Service reform, woman franchise, taxation of war profits and income.In reviewing the war situation, the Governor-General observed: &quot;Notwith-&quot; standing the disappointments in the Eastern theatre of war, there is no reason &quot; to doubt the ultimate triumph of our cause. &quot;The effort of the nations included &quot; within the British Commonwealth is still unabated, and will so continue to the &quot; end.&quot; A special reference to the United States then occurred as follows : &quot; Equally &quot; earnest and resolute is the spirit of all the Allied nations, and especially of the &quot; great neighbouring kindred Commonwealth whose energies, power, and vast &quot; resources are now beginning to make themselves felt strongly in determination of &quot; the issue.&quot;Debate on the Address. In the Debate following the speeches of the Mover and Seconder of the Speech from the Throne, the Leader of the Opposition (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) stated that he failed to see any change in the Government, and that it was the same as had existed for the past six years, as it had the same Leader.   He
admitted, however, itliat there had been a change in its complexion, stating that &quot; there has been infused into the Government a rosy red rouge colour, which was pleasing to the eye.&quot; He spoke eulogistic ally of his former associates, saying he was convinced that in joining the new administration they had been guided bv hinhlv conscientious convictions, bo far as he was concerned, the Opposition Leader said he supported all war measures except Conscription. Sir Wilfrid then attacked the War-time Elections Act, which gave votes to soldiers oversea and to soldiers&apos; female relatives, characterising the act as an &quot;outrage,&quot; and as contrary to the principles of British practice. He said the legislation denied fair play to the Opposition, and was designed to elect the Government. He concluded with the statement that the Government were guilty of a direct violation of the law of the land by calling Parliament to assemble before the actual certificates of the soldiers&apos; votes &quot;had been received from overseas.In reply, the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) observed that Sir W. Laurier was not logical in his statement that the Government was unchanged, as he had admitted later that there was an infusion of red blood in the administration. &quot; The infusion of that blood was exactly the intention when the Union Government was formed,&quot; corn-men ted the Premier, &quot; and on the Treasury Benches to-day is to be found the best blood of the Liberal Party in Canada.&quot; He further stated that the Government were compelled to act upon the cabled returns of the overseas voting, as the summoning of Parliament was necessary in order to provide means to carry on the vital business of the country in a time of war.As to the future, Sir K. Borden said that there had beeu much talk of peace, but it was all vain unless they could have such a peace as would assure the world against aggression in the future. He concluded by again pledging the Dominion&apos;s unswerving-support to the British and Allied Armies, to which end,die added, the Government was determined to devote the fullest resources of the country.Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Canadian Position. The Leader of the Opposition (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) made last week his first speech since the results of the General Election were announced. He said : &quot; The one way to keep our country on the right level is to &quot; make a firm resolution that it shall be Canada first, Canada last, and Canada all &quot; the time.&quot; Referring to the constitutional issues which have recently agitated many in French Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier said, &quot; The Canadian Confederation is &quot; on trial. It is stable, and will last. There may be a cloud, and there may be a &quot; reverse, but the light of freedom is always there, and will prevail in the end. &quot; Canada is a difficult country to govern. There are many languages, many races, &quot; and many religious beliefs. However, it is not impossible . .- . I have always &quot; endeavoured to keep Canada together and make it a united people.&quot;Dominion Representation on Allied Transport Council. The Dominion Govern-ment have enquired as to the arrangements that are proposed for the representation of Canada upon the Allied Maritime Transport Council which the Dominion Ministers understand is supervising the general conduct of allied maritime transport with a view to securing the most effective use of tonnage for munitions of war.Dominion Aircraft for Submarine Attack. In view of the probability of enemy submarines operating in the near future off the Canadian coast, and the necessity of using aircraft in connection with such attacks, the Admiralty have pointed out to the Dominion Government the desirability of establishing a kite balloon factory and airship construction works in Canada. It is pointed out that the United States are experimenting in connection with the idea of taking kite balloons across the Atlantic with convoys, and if this proves effective it appears that similar arrangements -would, be desirable for vessels from Canadian ports. The Admiralty, in stating that British assistance will uot.be possible,^suggest that the Dominion Government could get their first supply of kite balloons, cables, &amp;c, from the United States, and start manufacturing these in the meantime. In reply, the Dominion Government state they have considered the matter carefully, and observe that it would be impossible to organise the manufacture of seaplanes and kite balloons in time for service this year. The Minister of Naval Service is, however, sending officers to the United States to arrange for such assistance as may be possible.Ministry of Finance--The Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas&apos;White), whose health has necessitated a rest in California, was expected to return to Ottawa for the Opening
of Parliament, but it is now stated that the date of his return is uncertain. TJnder th&apos;e circumstances it is anticipated that he will be unable to deliver the Budget speech in the present Session of Parliament, and this duty will therefore devolve upon the-Acting Minister of Finance (Mr. Maclean).Pacifism in the Dominion.- The Dominion police have been enquiring into the work of the International Bible Students Association and its connection with the circulation of pacifist doctrines, as a result of which seven representatives of the Bible Students have been arrested for having in their possession and distributing copies of statements derogatory to Great Britain and the Allied cause. The Bible Students Association, though having only a small following in the Dominion, is stated to have spent large sums of money in advertising and propaganda, and investigations are being made into the source of their revenue.Tariff Arrangement/i. A matter which is exercising considerable influence upon the policy of the Government with regard to tariffs is the attitude adopted by the Western grain-growers, who, both before the formation of the Union Government and at the present time, have been pressing for the removal of all duties on farm implements. Owing to the combination of the Eastern Protectionists and the Western Liberals in the Unionist Party, joint action has been made possible, and a Committee repre-sentative of Commerce and Agriculture which recently met at Regina. representing the Provinces of Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, adopted a resolution requesting the Government to &quot; take immediate steps to confer with the manufacturers &quot; of agricultural implements, with a view to seeing if some satisfactory arrangement &quot; can be arrived at to remove, or largely reduce, the duty upon farm implements and &quot; raw material entering into manufacture.&quot;Shijiping on the Pacific. Regarding the requisitioning of Empress steamers now on the Pacific, (vide Reports No. 54 and. No. 58) the British Government have replied to the Dominion Ministers that the matter of withdrawing patrol vessels from the Pacific has been under consideration and that it is hoped to make arrangements with the Japanese naval authorities to permit of their release for convoy work. While fully realising the importance of the Empress steamers from a commercial standpoint, it is submitted that vital military requirements should take precedence, and the Shipping controller therefore hopes that the Dominion Ministers will be able to-requisition these steamers.Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau. The Dominion Government have telegraphed that they approve of the formation of an Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau in London, and they propose sending Dr. Miller of Toronto to represent Canada on the Advisory Body of the Bureau.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Imperial War Cahinet..-Th.e Prime Minister of Australia (Mr. Hughes) has telegraphed for information regarding the statement in the Press as to the probability of a General Election in the United Kingdom next July. In the event of there being any truth in the suggestion of an election taking place in July or even August, the Prime Minister pointed out that the meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet in June would clash with the campaign, and therefore he assumed that the date of the Cabinet meetings could with advantage be postponed. In reply, the British Government have intimated that there is no truth in the Press statement as to a General Election in July, and that the fact of the new Register not being completed until November next woidd in itself serve to dispose of the suggestion.Mr. Hughes and Peace Questions. A few days ago the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth reviewed the war situation and said a stage had been reached when every effort was necessary not only to achieve victory but to avert stalemate. An effective compromise with Germany was impossible. The Russian debacle had taught the&apos;lesson that we could not trust Germany, and there could be no peace without victory. He continued, &quot; Until Germany is beaten to the knees, there can be no &quot; peace. We must have men, ships, and foodstuffs. The situation is critical. &quot;Whether we can win with all our strength no man can say, but it is certain that we
&quot; shall lose unless we put forth every effort. The obligation rests on no one class &quot; or individual, but upon everyone. All citizens of the Empire have not yet found &quot;their national spirit. There is plenty of carping and destructive criticism, but &quot; suggestions of constructive and practicable policy are unfortunately wanting.&quot; &apos;Commonwealth Politics. -The group in the Nationalist Party which is led by Sir William Irvine, and which as regards conscription urged the Government to appeal to the country by means of a General Election instead of by the recent Referendum, is now pressing the Government for a statement of their reinforcements policy before Mr. Hughes leaves for England. The section of the party which supports Sir W. Irvine have not joined with the other sections in a common offensive against the Government, but the &quot; Irvine Group &quot; now assert that they have 16 supporters in the Federal Parliament. *Sir W. Irvine, in addressing his constituents last week, strongly advised the co-operation of all parties to secure recruits. He said if the new recruiting scheme failed and the Government still held office, he would withdraw his support.The suggestion made in the Victorian House of Assembly that the Labour extremists were intending to organise another great strike in May has been denied by the leaders of the Labour Party.Naval Shipbuilding. In reply to the enquiry of the Commonwealth Government as to the best types of light cruisers and destroyers, &amp;c, in connection with naval shipbuilding on Cockatoo Island (vide Report Mo. 57), the Admiralty have recommended destroyers of the V class, and light cruisers of the latest design (E) and submarines of L 50 class. The Admiralty suggest, however, that in place of the two submarines it would be preferable to build two destroyers unless the Commonwealth specially desire to construct submarines or there is some difficulty about building slips. The Admiralty express their willingness to supply designs, but they regret they cannot supply material except possibly completed armament.Gravity of Shipping Situation. The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has pointed out to the British Government the grave position with regard to shipping that will arise if more vessels are withdrawn from Australian trade. Mr. Hughes points out that the ships that remain are quits inadequate to deal with more than a small fraction of the accumulated products ; and the requisitioning of the Common-wealth Government Line by the British Government would involve an almost complete-paralysis of Australian trade. The Commonwealth Government, however, in their desire to assist in the war, will agree to a diversion of two further ships pending the consideration of the whole position.Requisitioning of utter-State Shipping. The Commonwealth Government have decided to requisition the inter-State shipping- tonnage and to appoint a Controller and a Board of Management. The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth states that the Australian public must stand the inconvenience&apos; in view of the urgent need of tonnage for oversea trade. -Shipbuilding. The Prime. Minister of the Commonwealth has announced an arrangement made with the New South Wales Government to the effect that the State Government shall build six steamers for the Commonwealth at Walsh Island. Shipbuilding is also now starting at Williamstown, and Mr. Hughes has expressed confidence that the arrangements he has made with the Unions will work satis-factorily.Organisation of Industry. A Conference has taken place between the Prime Minister and representatives of the Agricultural Society and industrial interests relating to the Government scheme of organisation of Commerce and Industry. The following Resolution was unanimously agreed upon, namely, that &quot; the time has come &quot; for the organisation of Australian industries, and that this Conference approves the &quot; main principles of the Prime Ministers scheme.&quot; A Committee was appointed to consider details.Australian War Museum. The Minister of Defence has stated that a collection of photographs is being made for the Australian War Museum on similar lines to that of the British War Museum.5257-3a B
Land for Returned Soldiers. The Victorian Minister for Lands (Mr. Clarke), in dealing with the State Policy of Repatriation, states that the time has arrived for laying^the foundation of the tremendous structure needed for closer settlement. He announced that the Board dealing with this subject has now arranged for 4,500 settlement areas, and he estimated that after the war there would be 9,000 settlers, involving 8,000,000Z. Three kinds of land would be allotted, purchased estates, ready-made farms, and Crown lands. When the men were granted areas, the Department would loan the whole initial expenses, less 10,0001. on the capital value, leaving them 4:001. out of 500Z. advanced by the Commonwealth Government to buv stock and carry on developmental work. It was intended to place 3,000 men on mixed farming&quot;and dairying land, each farm averaging 150 acres.Wool Question. In reply to the telegram from the Commonwealth Government &quot;relating to the auction sale of merino wool at Boston (vide Report No. 58) the British Government have telegraphed their regret to learn of the unrest caused in Australia in connection with this subject. After pointing out that in February of last year the probability of a certain proportion of wool, Avhich had been released for civilian use, beino- sold by auction was mentioned, and therefore that any embarrassment was not anticipated, the Commonwealth Government are asked for their views, having regard to the fact that the United States woidd be much inconvenienced by any restriction on the method of disposing of the 200,000 bales in question. In reply, the Commonwealth Government state that when the wool contract was arranged in 1916 the sales to neutral or allied countries were expected to take place by auction in London. It was not, therefore, anticipated that sales would take place in Boston, which might establish a precedent for sales, for example, in Japan. The Commonwealth Government, however, recognise that the British authorities are doing their best in trying circum-stances, and they consequently leave the matter in the hands of the British Government, feeling assured that Commonwealth interests will be duly protected.New South Wales and Japanese Language. It has been decided that the Japanese language shall be taught in New South Wales secondary schools and in Sydney University.   A commencement will be made in October next.Defeat of Victorian Government. The Victorian Government under Mr. Bowser, the Leader of the Independent Liberals or &quot; Economy &quot; party^, have been defeated in Parliament by a majority of one, and the Premier has advised the Governor to dissolve Parliament.The position of the parties in the Lower House (Legislative Assembly) as the result of the recent Victorian State Elections was as follows : Liberals (under Sir A. Peacock) - - -15Independent Liberals or &quot; hconomy &quot; Party (under mr. Bowser) &apos;29 Labour        - - - - -   21Now that, the Independent Liberals have been defeated, a new combination is being formed between the Liberals and Independent Liberals under the leadership of Mr. H. S. W. Lawson. who was Attorney-General in Sir A. Peacock&apos;s administration. It is expected that Mr. Lawson will be able to form a new Cabinet.Queensland Elections. The result of the Queensland elections has confirmed the Labour Government (under Mr. Ryan as Premier) in power. The Government will have 51 Labour supporters in the new House of Assembly as against 21 Nationalists. All the sqldier candidates but two were defeated.Queensland and Hansard Seizures.-With regard to the motion of the Premier of Queensland (Mr. Ryan) to commit Mr. Hughes to prison for contempt of court in connection with the seizures of the Queensland Parliamentarv debates containing anti-conscription matter (vide Report No. 46 and Appendix to Report No 59) the High Court of Australia has granted an application for an adjournment of the motion Ihe view of the High Court was indicated by the remark of the Chief Justice who in fixing April 1st as the date of the adjourned hearing, stated that this was &quot; a very proper date &quot; for the subject to be considered.
NEW ZEALAND.Control of Foreign Shipping. The Dominion Government have telegraphed that they will he prepared to co-operate in securing further effective control over foreign shipping. The Ministers, however, point out that power already exists to enable action to be taken and that the loading of any foreign or neutral ships can be prevented except under such conditions as may be imposed. The Dominion Government have furnished the British Authorities with the necessary Priority lists regarding essential imports from the United States and Canadian Atlantic and Pacific Ports, and also from India, Ceylon, and the Far East.Shipping Difficulties. The Dominion Ministers have telegraphed to the British Government regarding the diversion of shipping, and while indicating their entire appreciation of the fact that war requirements must come first, they represent that a serious shortage of shipping would he disastrous to the financial and commercial position of the Dominion. The Ministers therefore trust that every effort will be made to provide ships for the transport of New Zealand products to British ports in order to keep the primary industries going. Information as to the quantities of this season&apos;s produce now awaiting shipment is given, with the request that it may he laid before the Shipping Controller.Maori Gift. In sending a sum &quot;of money collected by Maori Tribes to His Majesty the King, the Chiefs have forwarded a letter to His Majesty in which occurs this passage : &quot; Under the great pressure and strain of endurance of this great war &quot; we, your people in this far-away land, are making every effort to keep our end up in 4&apos; supporting our brothers in this great struggle.&quot;SOUTH AFRICA.Parliamentary Session. It is anticipated that Parliament will rise about the middle of April, and that the next session will either begin in November or be postponed until January, the latter being the most probable.Government Gold Areas. The House of Assembly discussed on March 1.3th the Report of the Select Committee upon the supplementary agreement between the Government and the Government Gold Mining Areas (Modderfontein) Consolidated, amending the sliding scale of profits payable to the Government under the original agreement.Mr. Patrick Duncan, in moving the adoption of, the Report (which was carried in Committee by eight votes to six, and recommended that the agreement should not be sanctioned), emphasised that agreements should not be altered unless an overwhelming-case was made out, which, he contended, had not been done in this case. Mr. Jagger, however, who was Chairman of the Committee, moved an amendment confirming the alteration of the contract. Mr. J. N. Merriman strongly condemned the.evil precedent of altering contracts, &quot; and making the House a medium for bull points on the market.&quot;The Minister of Mines (Mr. Malan) pointed out that under the Gold Law of 1903 the Government had the power not only to amend leases but to make original contracts without the sanction of Parliament, Two areas had already been leased, and the Government was considering a third lease. He maintained that the Committees report had not shown a tittle of evidence in favour of condemning the proposed alteration of the lease.When the debate was resumed on March 14th, General Botha denied the suggestion that the Government was making the question one of confidence. He considered that the Select Committee had no right to examine the principle and should have gone solely into &quot;the merits of the contract, but the, Report did not contain a single word regarding its merits. He emphasised that the Government intended to appoint an official with special qualifications to see that the Modderfontein and other mines were properly worked.In the result the House adopted Mr. Jagger&apos;s amendment confirming the Mining Lease by 68 votes to 33.Return of German Colonies. A Conference of Returned Soldiers Associations, representative of the whole of South Africa, which was held at Blomfontein last
week, adopted by acclamation a resolution against the return of the lost Colonies to Germany.The Diocesan Anglican Missionary Conference sitting at Blomfontein has unani-: m on sly passed a resolution earnestly hoping that in no case would German South-TWest Africa and German East Africa be returned to Germany.GERMAN AFRICA.German Colonies as Naval Bases. In his recent speech in the Reichstag the German Colonial Secretary (Dr. Solf; referred to the fear expressed by General Smuts that Germany would use her colonies as naval bases. n Dr. Solf replied: &quot; In answer to that I must, as regards the past, point, out that before the war not one of our African coast stations was provided with artillery &quot; at all because we had never thought of making Africa a theatre of warfare for &quot; Whites, while England and France had equipped a number &quot;of their ports as &quot; complete naval stations.&quot;Economic Value of German Colonies. Dr. Solf, in an introduction to a hook that will shortly be published, states that he has himself frequently defined in public speeches the German Colonial programme, which comprises the recovery of the Protectorate and its welding into a complete whole on a sound economic basis. He asserts that &quot; it is necessary for Germany to share in the spheres of sovereignty &quot; outside Europe if she is not to sink to the rank of a secondary Power &quot; ; and in the economic connection he observes : &quot; Colonies wall be indispensable to Germany for the supply of raw materials which her enemies threaten to cut off.&quot; He continues to argue that the colonisation spheres of the world should be divided among the Powers in proportion to the greatness of their economic requirements, stating that &quot; the &quot; disproportionately large Colonial possessions of France, Portugal and Belgium show &quot; the unfairness of the present distribution.&apos;&apos;Captain Perseus, in a recent article in the Berliner Tagcblalt, states that Colonies are a necessity to Germany as the chief object &quot; is to get from them raw materials for her home industries.&quot; He observes : &quot; Germany s Colonies should make &quot; her more or less independent of foreign markets, for after the war Great Britain, &quot; America and France will probably hedge themselves round with an economic &quot; fence, and Germany will have tomake the greatest possible efforts to overcome the &quot;hindrances placed in her path by this enemy trust controlling practically the whole &quot; world&apos;s raw materials.&quot;In emphasising the need of possessions from which to draw raw materials, Captain Perseus commends to favourable consideration Professor DelbriiclSs plan of abandoning other Colonial possessions in favour of &quot;one big East African Colony.&quot;Togoland. Wolffs Agency has issued the following telegram from Berlin, date;! February loth : &quot; According to accounts given by returned German missionaries, the negro tribes of the German Colony of Togo were required in the middle of the year 1916 either to Become English or to make a declaration that for the future they desired to remain German. Those who declared that they -wanted to remain German were without exception punished 103^ being set to forced labour. This well authenticated fact is a proof of the way in which the English Government understands the natives&apos; right of self-determination. For the rest, so far as the missionaries could observe, the English coercive measures were of no avail. The greater part of the Togo negroes continue to be animated by the desire that the German rule should be re-established as soon as possible in place of the English.&quot;With reference to the foregoing, ReutePs Agency has announced, as the result of enquiries, that it has been ascertained that the allegations are pure inventions. The question of the future of Togoland was not discussed in 1916 or at any other time with the native tribes, and forced labour ceased to exist when the German rule came to an end.&apos;(vide Report No. 55). It is added that judging from the spontaneous expressions of loyalty by the Chiefs and others, there can be no doubt as to the desire of the tribes to remain under British sovereignty.The position of the natives under British ride was referred to in Report No. 55.
