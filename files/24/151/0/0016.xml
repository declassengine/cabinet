SECRET.84APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. G5.PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Canada.The decision of the Dominion Government to take powers to call up all young men between 19 and 23 will enable Canada to provide those immediate reinforcements which Sir R. Borden told the first Secret Session of Parliament were so urgently necessary. Without the Order-in-Council, which has been now approved by Parliament in the first division taken since the formation of the Union Government, the Premier informed the House that it would not have been possible to supply reinforcements for the Canadian Divisions after July 1st.The question of taking further steps to ensure that the Canadian Government is fully informed in the matter of the diversion of shipping is receiving the careful attention of the War Cabinet.Newfoundland.The adoption of the policy of selective conscription is of much interest. There was some difference between the Parties some time ago, and ,the position of the then Prime Minister (Sir Edward, now Lord, Morris) was rendered somewhat difficult in consequence. The pressure of circumstances, represented by the German massed attacks, has solved the problem for Newfoundland, as it has clone for other Dominions.The observations of the Government, upon the interim report of the Economic Offensive Committee should be noted.A USTllALTAN  COMMONWEALTH.The decision of the Commonwealth Cabinet that Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cook shall represent them at the forthcoming meetings in London seems now to be quite final.The Recruiting Conference called by the Governor-General may succeed im helping forward the solution of a problem which two Referenda and a General Election have failed to provide. Whether the voluntary system can succeed in furnishing the reinforcements necessaiy to.maintain the Australian Divisions at full strength is again to be put to the test, and the new Minister for Recruiting is apparently going to use every known device to induce eligible men to enlist.The great loyalty demonstration arranged in Melbourne is apparently a reply to the recent public meeting expressing admiration of Archbishop Mannix.   It should
strengthen the hands of the Government in their determination to suppress disloyal utterances aud the display of disloyal emblems.Other Australian matters which should receive attention in tins Report are those relating to Industrial problems, Finance, and the South Australian Stale Elections.New Zealand.After a Session of about a week&apos;s duration Parliament has been prorogued. The message from the Dominion about the provision of troops is typical of New Zealand patriotism.South Africa.The increased activities of the Nationalists seem to be based upon the belief that the Germans are going to prove victorious, and that such a result would afford opportunities for hoisting the Republican flag. The position in South Africa is undoubtedly serious, but is improving, and General Botha, supported as he is both by his own Party and by the Unionist and Labour Parties, may be trusted to cope successfully with any situation that may arise.The observations of the Union Ministers upon the proposals put before them relating to enemy&apos; and allied trading after the war, deserve the careful attention of those who are interested in matters affecting the trade of the Empire.The Union Government will doubtless deal suitably with the recent action of the Netherlands Consul-General in South Africa.Spanish West Africa. The position of Germans in Fernando Po requires careful watching.The Pacific.Further developments of the question of Japanese trading with the Solomon Islands will demand careful consideration.G. G. A.April 25th, 1918.

PART I. - BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.CANADA.The First Secret Session,.- -The first Secret Session of the Dominion Hori.se of Commons was held on April 17th, when the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) made a full statement on the war, dealing with the present military position, the snpplyand production of foodstuffs, the problem of merchant shipping and the submarine, with special reference to the man-power position in the British Empire and allied countries. The Prime Minister read a message from Mr. Lloyd George, which had been furnished specially for the purpose.After reading the above-mentioned message, Sir R. Borden declared in the course of his speech in the House of Commons that the. Canadian. Corps must be main-tained, and that no other alternative was before the Government but the proposed further measures for recruiting in order to find the needed reinforcements.Reinforcement Proposals. The Dominion Government proposals for providing additional reinforcements were placed before both Houses of Parliament last week, and these involved the calling to the colours within the next few weeks of men between the ages of 20 and 22 years of age inclusive, without regard to previous exemptions ; while the calling up of men of 19 and 23 was left to the discretion of the Minister of Militia. The main motion approving of the proposals was carried iu the House of Commonsdry a vote of 111- to 65, being a Government majority of 49 in the first division which had taken place in the House since the formation of the Union Government.   In the course of his statement, the Prime Minister said : &quot; The need is so urgent that without this Order in Council I do not believe we can provide adecpiate reinforcements after July 1st. The first line of our defence is held in France and Flanders; the second line of defence is here. Will, those in the second line desert and betray those in the first&quot;? &quot;In conclusion, the Prime Minister made a strong appeal for national unity by the different Canadian races and religions, and urged the Press of both languages to refrain from indulging in utterances calculated to provoke and perpetuate bitterness and religious controversy. The Leader of the Opposition (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) declared that the resolution was based on the principle of Prussian autocracy, and wras opposed to the British principle of constitutional government. He expressed his opposition to sending men overseas Avhen there was urgent need in Canada that all the country&apos;s labour should be used to increase the production of foodstuffs. The President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Powell), in reply, stated that &quot; Our duty is not to send food or men, but food and men. The people of Canada will not have done their full duty,&quot; he added, &quot; if they confine their efforts to either of these contributions. Our duty is to send men, food, munitions, ships, money all. Canada has staked everything in this war, and it is her. duty and privilege to do her utmost.&quot; The Minister of Public Works (Mr. F. B. Carvoll) stated that the one great question that every man in Parliament should ask himself was &quot; What is necessary in the interests of this country at large ? &quot;
A motion to exempt men employed in agriculture was defeated by US votes to 70.An Or&apos;der-in-Council calling out the men of 20 to 22 was signed on April 20th by the Governor-General. The exemptions of men between those ages in Class I. have been cancelled, and it is expected that at least 30,000 recruits, physically fit for combatant service oversea, will thus be obtained.Diversion of Shipping. The Dominion Government informed the British Govern-ment by telegram on March 28th that they- had learnt with much surprise that arrangements had been made, without consultation with them, to divert to New York a large part of the tonnage now sailing to and from Canadian ports, and they asked for information as to the reason for the Dominion Government not being consulted. They stated that any repetition of such an incident would be viewed by them with the utmost concern. In reply, it was pointed out that the shipjfing arrangements were made in order to replace specific ships of 12J to 16 knots by equivalent tonnage of slower speeds and not with the object of diverting tonnage from Canadian to New York ports. The intention was to obviate the delay and deviation incidental to the present system. It was hoped to save eight days on each round trip, and the necessity of securing rapid movement of troops and food was paramount. The Shipping Controller, it -was added, did not wish to notify the scheme until its practicability7 was clear, and, being satisfied as to this, he was now anxious to arrange for the diversion at the earliest date possible. (The Admiralty- further notified the Dominion Government on April 16th as to the arrangements for expediting the conveyance of troops to Franco, which, it was announced, were communicated to., the Naval authorities at, Ottawa on April 8th.) The Dominion Government, in reply-, on April 17th, stated that they regretted the necessity for recording their opinion that failure to consult them respecting the proposed arrange-men ts was not satisfactorily7 explained or indeed explained at all, and they asked for an explicit assurance that with regard to matters so vitally7 concerning the country, the British Government would not proceed upon the principle of deciding first and consulting the Canadian Government afterwards.Movements of Grain.-The Dominion Government have informed the British authorities that as a result of the measures taken to expedite the movements of grain since the close of navigation last yrear, more grain or flour has been despatched from Canadian Atlantic ports during the present season than has ever been sent before. It is estimated that there are now forty-six million bushels in the Dominion, and it is intended to send overseas during the next two and a half months about two-thirds of this amount either in wheat or flour equivalent. In this case there will be a shortage in Canada of 51- million bushels, as the present y7ear&apos;s crop will not be available till the end of September.- In the belief that the larger and faster vessels are to be diverted from Canadian ports, in spite of the wastage of tonnage if Canadian routes are not used to the fullest extent, the Dominion Ministers state that it seems regret-table that full advantage should not be taken of the railways of the Dominion which they point out could easily7 deal with the movements of grain from the United States north-west to Montreal as well as the Canadian summer grain movement. The Ministers add that the port of Montreal has not yet been worked to its full capacity.NEWFOUNDLAND.Conscription Bill. The Newfoundland Government have decided to introduce a measure of Compulsory Service, and the necessity for this will lie disclosed to a Secret Session,of Parliament. Published reports state that compulsion will be on a selective basis, and confined at first to unmarried men and widowers (without children) between the ages of 19 and 39.Economic Offensive. In acknowledging the receipt of the Interim Report of the Economic Offensive Committee of the War Cabinet, dealing with&apos; the post-war control of raw materials, the Newfoundland Government have forwarded a list of raw materials exported from the Colony during the y-ear ended June 1917, showing that practically7 all such materials go to British Dominions or to the United States of America. It is observed, therefore, that the question is really7 a simple one as regards Newfoundland.
AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Imperial War Conference. The Minister for the Navy (Mr. Cook) announced in Parliament on April 10th that Mr. Hughes and he would represent the Commonwealth at the forthcoming meetings of the Imperial War Conference.Recruiting Conference. At the Recruiting Conference convened by the Governor-General on April 12th, 10 representatives were present out of the 45 invited. Those attending included the Minister for the Navy (Mr. Cook), who attended as representing the Commonwealth Government in the absence of Mr. Hughes through illness, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor), the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Milieu), the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Gardiner), the Minister for Recruiting (Mr. Orchard), the Director-General of Recruiting (General Mackinnon), the President of the Central Council of Employers (Senator Fairbairn). The Premiers of each State, and the Leaders of the Opposition in the State Parliaments were also present, together with most of the States&apos; leaders of Political Labour, Industrial Labour and Employers&apos; organisations.In the official report of the proceedings, the Governor-General is reported as saying that the readiness of those present to put aside all considerations of personal con-venience in order to attend was a proof that their view of the gravity of the emergency coincicled with his. After referring to the situation on the Western Front, the Governor-General said that the Imperial Government had issued an urgent appeal to the Dominions for reinforcements. &quot;Australia&quot; he declared &quot;was convinced of the necessity to overthrow German militarism, but there Avas a discrepancy between Australians will power and man power, and this meeting had to consider jioav to bring the tAvo into harmony.&quot; Regarding the report of the Chief Justice (Sir Samuel Griffiths), Avhich Avas presented before the great assault, the GoA^ernor-General announced that this shoAved that a certain number of men Avere needed to replace existing shortages and for reinforcements. The position being uoav more serious Avas sufficiently grave to justify the sinking of public and personal antipathies in one sujneme united effort to find an issue from the impasse, so that Australia&apos;s name should stand high in honour when peace came. Referring to the fact that the. policy of voluntary enlistment had been definitely adopted by Australia, the Governor-General said &quot; Do not let us aa^aste one word regretting it or explaining the reasons, for that decision but rather bend all our energies towards devising means for making the voluntary system a success.&quot;The Director General of Recruiting Avas elected as Chairman of the Conference, and Sir George SteAvarcl as Secretary.The meeting of the Conference Avas suspended, on April 16th in order to permit of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) consulting with the State Premiers regarding proposals made by the Leader of the Federal Opposition (Mr. Tudor).Stimulating Recruiting. The Minister for Recruiting (Mr. Orchard) is adopting A&apos;various measures to stimulate recruiting. For example, he is superseding the system of quietly despatching troops at an early hour in the morning by an arrangement for giving the men a befitting send-off with a parade through the streets and a public demonstration. He is also arranging for returned soldiers to be Avelcomed home on a more elaborate scale inA^olving receptions at the railway stations and wharfs with bands to be followed by street processions. There will also be special parades of returned soldiers and recruits throughout the State Capitals, and bodies of the Australian Imperial Forces will, proceed through the State of Victoria on a recruiting mission. A spectacular route march from Armidale to Newcastle, New South Wales, has been organised, and this will extend over about two months.The Minister has telegraphed to all the State Ministers of Education asking that in order to commemorate Anzac Remembrance Night on April 26th and awaken a fresh war spirit, bonfires shall be lighted in all school grounds simultaneously and patriotic songs sung.Enlistments for the aa-eek ending April 6th shoAved an impixwement in all States OA&apos;er the previous week. Several firms in Sydney have issued notices terminating the employment of men eligible for enlistment.Loyalty Demonstration. At the great loyalty demonstration held in the Melbourne Exhibition Building about a fortnight ago it is estimated that over 40,000 people were present.   The meeting aaTas   addressed  from, four  platforms,  and  passed
unanimously two resolutions. The first affirmed the passionate loyalty of those present to the ideal for which, the Empire was fighting, and the second resolution recorded the keen gratification of the meeting that the Commonwealth Government had created fresh powers for the suppression of disloyal utterances,&apos; demonstrations and emblems, and expressed the hope that in the highest interests of Australia there would be swift and drastic action should offences be repeated. This reso-lution continued : &quot; The meeting also affirms its conviction that the. vast majority of Australians are loyal to their country and to the Motherland, and would eagerly support the Government in any measures taken against traitors who are striving for the disruption of the Empire on which Australia^ life and liberty depend.&quot; -Prejudicing, Relations with Foreign Powers. Regarding the prosecution of Mr. Catts under the War Precautions Act on the ground that his speech in the Federal House of Representatives during the No-Confidence Debate was likely to prejudice His Majesty&apos;s relations with Foreign Powers, for which reason reprinted copies of the speech were seized by the Military Authorities (vide Report No. 63), the case against Mr. Catts has been dismissed by the magistrate.Defence Administration. In order to give expression to the. view that the Portfolio of Defence should be transferred from the Senate (where it is held by Senator Pearce) to the House of Representatives, a reduction of Supply by 11. wras moved in Parliament last week, and this is being treated by the Government as a No-Confidence Motion. A section of Ministerialists in the Lower House strongly criticised Senator Pearce&apos;s administration, Which was warmly defended by Mr. Cook.Industrial Problems. The Minister for the Navy (Mr. Cook) has announced in Parliament that legislation, based on defence powers, would be introduced by the. Government in order to remove the defects in industrial machinery and to provide a more effective method for dealing with industrial problems. The scope of the measure, he said, would be limited to industries of national importance, such as transport, base metals, coal mining, metallurgy and the manufacture of munitions.Finance and War Loan. The Commonwealth Treasurer (Mr. Watt) in introducing the three months Supply Bill said he hoped to close the financial year with a moderate surplus of 750,0001. Proposals for fresh taxation would be submitted early in the new financial year.In view of the special arrangements for inducing subscriptions to the War Loan, Mr. Watt announced that he would extend the closing date to April 24-th. The sum ot 38,000,000?. had been subscribed up to April 14th, and Mr. Watt expressed the view some days later that over 40,000,000?.. would be subscribed.South- Australian Elections. The State General Election in South Australia has resulted in the Coalition (Liberal and Labour, termed &quot; Constitutionists &quot;) securing 28 seats, while the Socialists (Labour) have 17 seats. There is one Independent repre-senting the Farmers&apos; and Settlers&apos; Association.NEW ZEALAND.Proi-ogation of Parliament. The Dominion Parliament, which met on April 9th for the short Session, was prorogued on April 17th.Provision of Troops and their Transport. The Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) has telegraphed to the British Government that he fully realises the urgent need of sending every available man, and he proposes therefore to send as many troops as possible, even though not fully trained. He suggests using the cargo space of every ship for troops, and submits that the vessels had better adopt the routes they would take if carrying cargo. In reply the Army Council have intimated that they are fully prepared to receive as many men as can be sent, even though not fully trained. The Shipping Controller has agreed to vessels which complete their loading at New Zealand ports, and are destined for the United Kingdom, being used for troops. He states that ships should proceed via Panama irrespective of their speed, but he observes that, in the case of the slower types of ships, it may be necessary to tranship troops -at the United States ports.
SOUTH AFRICA.General Hertzog and Internment Camps. The House of Assembly commenced the discussion on April 18th of the Loan vote of 2,862,0001. for war expenses, including a grant of 1,000,0001. for Imperial war purposes. In the course of the Debate the Leader of the Nationalists (General Hertzog) referred to the internment camps, and objected to their being-maintained in Natal where, he said, people were anti-German. He suggested their removal to the Transvaal or the Orange Free State Province, and he strongly complained of the internment of South Africans without trial.The Minister of the Interior (Sir Thomas Watt) quoted various authorities including the German Benevolent Society officials, showing that the camps were managed in the most satisfactory way. Mr. II. A. Wyndham (Unionist) complained of the release of .611 suspects after internment.The Prime Minister (General Botha) pointed out that out of two thousand persons interned only three were born in South Africa and only eleven were naturalised Britishers. The Premier agreed to the necessity of making the lot of the interned persons as bearable as possible-and promised that an enquiry would be made about the matter, after the session, especially with regard to naturalised South Africans.The Republican Campaign. The continuance of the above-mentioned Debate in the House of Assembly brought forth some strong declarations on all sides regarding Republican ambitions. General Hertzog complained of the recruiting methods, to which he ascribed the disturbances that had taken place, and Sir P. Fitzpatrick,(Unionist) denounced General Hertzog for preaching sedition and rebellion in the country. The whole Nationalist Party then walked out of the Chamber. Sir P. Fitzpatrick, con-tinuing, declared that the Nationalists were acting like paid spies and hirelings of the enemy and were deliberately provoking disturbances and civil war.The Prime Minister followed with an earnest appeal for tolerance. He asked Britishers not to expect from Afrikanders what they expected from themselves, and on the other hand he urged the Nationalists to put an end to the Republican propa-ganda, and to stop the organisation which was going on because it was leading to civil war. In an eloquent passage General Botha exclaimed : &quot; Stop, for God&apos;s sake, stop ! I feel that the position is extremely serious and I appeal to all members to set an example to the country of moderate language and to lead in the direction of peace. Let us rather consult each other, because if we do not I fear for the future. If members refuse to co-operate with me I shall have to take other steps and have legislation introduced to enforce peace.&quot;General Hertzog declared that he was anxious to preserve peace, but blamed the Opposition and the Ministerial speeches for the present position. He contended that the Nationalists had the fullest right to ask for an amendment to the Constitution in order to obtain a Republic.Mr. Patrick Duncan (Unionist) emphasised tbe fact that when the Nationalists referred to themselves as slaves, and to the men in France who were fighting the battles of civilisation as the scum of the earth, /there was bound to be trouble. He declared that the premier&apos;s policy of conciliation was the only thing which could save the white population of South Africa-Mr. De Beer (Nationalist) moved a reduction of defence salaries by half-a-million, and also the deletion, of the grant of &quot; 1,000,000Z. for Imperial war purposes.&quot;On leaving the House of Assembly on April 18th, General Hertzog was assaulted by a person who is described in the Press as &quot;apparently irresponsible.&quot; Mr. II. A. Wyndham intervened and it is reported that nobody was much hurt. In the House of Assembly afterwards the Prime Minister expressed the regret of the House for the occurrence, arid this w-as supported by the Leaders of the Unionist and Labour Parties. General Hertzog described the affair as trumpery &quot; and expressed thanks for the assistance he had received.General Hertzog&apos;s speech has attracted great attention. The Gape Times denounces the attempt by a faction to force upon South Africa an issue which is based on falsity and fraud and which if carried further can only lead to internal strife and the ruin of South Africa.The Cape Argus says : &quot; The plain meaning of General Hertzog&apos;s speech seems to be that the Nationalist wire-pullers are resolved on a Republican offensive synchronizing with Germany&apos;s titanic efforts.   It may be that the object is a limited
one to create such a ferment in South Africa as to bring recruiting for overseas to a standstill.&quot; The Argus appeals to the British and Dutch to stand together by the policy of the National Convention.It is to be noted that in an earlier speech at Paarl on April 13th, General Hertzog is reported in the Press as stating, &quot; The conviction is becoming stronger and stronger in my mind that a souud national feeling between the two sections of our population can never be depended upon here in South Africa so long as the present state of subjection, or alleged subjection, to Great Britain continues.&quot;In the course of a speech at Johannesburg, Dr. Malan, the Editor of the leading-Nationalist organ De Burger, declared that nobody could be a good South African who was not a Republican. Other speakers have spoken openly in favour of Republicanism, and the Transvaal Republic hag has been exhibited.It is reported, however, that during the last few days the Nationalist attitude has  changed for  the better, and it is  believed that they may have appreciated, that they have already gone too far.   The Leaders of the Nationalist Party are indicating their desire to damp down Republican propaganda and to use their influence against any attempt at an armed rising.First Joint Session. The Senate and the House-of Assembly held their first Joint Session on April I 7th according to Press reports. This was in pursuance of the clause in the South Africa Act which provides for a session of both Houses being held when an amendment of the Constitution is to be considered. In the present case the subject under deliberation was the clause in the Electoral Bill providing for the -voting of soldiers at the-Front. General Hertzog moved an amendment to restrict the power of the Speaker to exercise his deliberative vote, the object apparently being to endeavour to prevent the Government obtaining the support of the requisite two-thirds majority of both Houses.Netherlands Consul-General and Dutch Shipping. With regard to the letter of the Netherlands Consul-General concerning the Dutch shipping question which appeared in the Cape Times (vide Report No. 63), the Secretary of State for the Colonies has communicated to the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa the opinion of the British Foreign Secretary that a foreign Consular Officer is acting outside his official functions in making a Press attack upon the political action of the Government of the country where he officially resides. It is therefore suggested that the Governor-General should address a communication to the Consul-General informing him of the view taken, and demanding an assurance that he will not repeat the irregularity. In the event of his compliance, the correspondence should be published ; while if he refuses it is suggested that he should be warned that steps will be taken to secure his dismissal. The Governor-General is asked if the Union Ministers concur in the above suggestions.Enemy Trading after the War. In reply to the telegram from the British Government regarding the question of the most-favoured-nation clauses in British commercial treaties being used, after the war, to secure advantages for our present enemies (vide Report No. 58, under &quot; Imperial Affairs&apos;&quot;), the Union Ministers see no objection to the course proposed, but consider that&apos; the Resolution passed at the Imperial Conference of 1911 (page 64 of the Proceedings) should not be lost sight of when the question of the renewal of commercial treaties with the enemy is brought up. The Union Government call attention to the fact that South Africa, as well as other Dominions, has its own distinct fiscal policy, and, while the commercial relations of Great Britain and other countries is primarily a matter for the British Government to determine, it is thought that the Dominions should be at liberty to withdraw from the operation of any treaty without interfering with the application of the treaty to the rest of the Empire.Allied and Neutral Trading after the- War. With reference to the enquiry of the British Governmental to the views of the Dominions upon the issue of a despatch to Allied and neutral countries relating to equal commercial treatment during the period of reconstruction (vide Report No. 58), the Union Government have replied that they see no objection to the proposed despatch. They suggest, however, generally, that it is inadvisable for the British Government to bind themselves at present to any definite after-war&apos; policy during the period of reconstruction, for if the circumstances are different from those contemplated, it is submitted that engagements might prove a hindrance to commercial expansion.
GERMAN EAST AFRICA.Progress of Military Forces-General Northoy reported on April 18th that on April 9th one company of the King&apos;s African Rifles attacked the enemy on the -Lureko river, south-east of Mtarika, and dispersed it, capturing ammunition, food, porters, and two&apos;machine guns. On April 8th half a battalion dispersed a very-important company east of Mahua and captured food and kit, but on April 11th the force became engaged with a superior force and were compelled to retire to Malma with 46 casualties and the loss of a Maxim gun and a Lewis machine gun. Heavy loss was, however, inflicted on the enemy.SPANISH WEST AFRICA.German Native Troops and Submarine Activity. The British Ambassador at Madrid has been instructed to represent to the Spanish Authorities the grave position arising from German submarine activity off the West African Coast, and. the presence of 6,000 armed German native troops under German officers on Fernando Po who practically control the administration and announce their intention of invading the Cameroons. The. British representative is asked to demand the disarmament and repatriation of the German troops. In reply to the representations made, the Spanish Minister of State has declared that he does not credit the abeged intention of the Germans to invade the CameroOns, and he obseiwes that the German-native troops are unarmed. He is, however, consulting with the representatives of his Government at Fernando Po.THE PACIFIC.Japanese. Trade iciih the Solomons. The British Ambassador at Tokio has been informed that with regard to the application of a Japanese firm to trade with the Solomon Islands he should reply that it is not proposed to issue further permits for-the time being.In the event of the Japanese Government raising the cpiestion, the British representative will explain that the German Solomon Islands are occupied by Australian troops, and military reasons render it inadvisable for trading licences to be given to those who are not domiciled in these islands, and who would not therefore be readily controlled by local regulations. As to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, the existing circumstances at present prevent British stdojects&apos; from trading between the islands, and to grant permission to foreigners would thus result in giving the latter a preference.Fiji and the War. The Legislative Council of Fiji passed&quot; a Resolution on April 19th, expressing its unabated pride in the valour of the British and Allied Armies, confidence in the ultimate triumph of the just cause for which they are fighting, and unwavering. devotion to His Majesty. The Resolution further offered on behalf of the people of the Colony such further assistance in men and money as they had at their disposal.
