SECRET.APPRECIATION Op THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 74,PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Canada.The Dominion Prime Minister has made a striking statement about the Canadian effort in the war, showing the contribution of the people, more particularly in relation to the provision of Man Power, Shipbuilding, and. Munitions.The announcement of the Minister of Finance about the adjustment of the exchange with the United States is important, Other matters of interest under this heading are those relating to the progress of National Registration, the operation of the Military Service Act. and the extent of labour troubles in the Dominion.Australian Comm on wealth.The statement of the Acting-Prime Minister on the consideration by the Commonwealth Cabinet of the appointment of a Minister to reside in London shows that the proposal was based upon the Avar interests of the Commonwealth.The observations of the Acting-Prime Minister about the co-operation of political parties for purposes of recruiting, and the attitude of pacifists, merit attention. The drastic proposal of the New South Wales Government to disfranchise those guilty of seditious utterances should go far to reduce the influence of the disloyalists. The action, of the Federal. Government as affecting the Irish Republican Brotherhood should have a similar effect,The resolutions of the Inter-State Labour Congress again indicate the jealous regard of Official Labour for the autonomous rights of Australia as a nation.South Africa.The statements in this Report about the progress in recruiting, and the industrial situation on the Rand, are of interest. The figures of the recent census showing the increases of the European population in South Africa, are important.In dta.(Excluding external affairs.) The political position, as affected by the action of the Home Rulers at the Bombay War Conference, should be noted.G. G. A.June 27th, 191.8.

PART   L-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Imperial War Cabinet anal Conference. The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) has requested the President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Rowell) to assist him as the second Canadian Member of the Imperial War Cabinet, and he has entrusted the work of representing the Dominion at the Imperial War Conference to the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Arthur Meighen) and the Minister of Immigration and Colonisation (Mr. J. A. Calcler).Dominion Effort in the War. The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) in his statement upon the Dominion effort in the war, delivered before the Empire Parlia--mentary Association on June 21st, stated in regard to the provision of man-power that during the past 12 or Id months more than 130,000 men had joined the colours in Canada. He continued, &quot; We have 35,000 more men in France than we had when I left these shores last year. To-day there are more than.385,000 men of the Canadian Expeditionary Force who have crossed the ocean, and they are still coming. In addition to that, we have sent into the Air Service during the past 3-1 years of war 14,000 men, and to various arms of the Imperial service and to the armies of various Allied nations we have contributed from the manhood of Canada at least 35,000 men.&quot; In all, Sir R. Borden pointed out, Canada had sent overseas not less than 425,000 men. Speaking of casualties, he said that when he left these shores last year there had been 78,000 casualties, and he added, &quot;There have been 152,000*casuaIties to-day in the Canadian Expeditionary Force.&quot; eThe Dominion Premier also referred to shipbuilding and said that there were some 14 shipyards with 45 berths in the Dominion. About -15,000 tons of shipping-had recently been laid clown, and, he stated, &quot; We expect to Fry down about 175,000 tons during 1918. We expect to turn out 84,000 tons deadweight this year and 250,000 tons next year.&quot;Regarding munitions, Sir R. borden mentioned in the above statement that Canada had produced nearly one thousand million dollars&apos; worth of munitions, &quot; and of some particular varieties of shells Canada has turned out for the past IS months 40 per cent, of the entire needs of the British Army.&quot; In this connection the Prime Minister called attention to the fact that the Dominion Exchequer had loaned to the Imperial Government $460,000,000 to assist in paying for munitions and that Canadian banks had loaned another 8100,000,000 for this purpose.Operation of Military Service Act. In connection with the recently prddished returns [showing the operation of the Military Service Act, a Militia Department statement says : Evidently there is some misunderstanding as to the number of men obtained in relation to the 100,000 authorised under the statute. The total number of men obtained through&quot;the machinery of the Act up to June 19th was 57,295, to which may be added, for the purpose of determining the number of men available, 16,807 who reported voluntarily.   The detailed statement to June 19th is as foUows &apos;. Reported as ordered        . - - - -   4S,575Reported late or apprehended as defaulters - -   12,o37Defaulters apprehended who had failed to register -     7,350Total - - - -   68,462Deduct number discharged or on leave without expense tothe public       - -  - - - -   11,167Net number secured under the Act - - -   o7,295Add number who voluntarily reported - -   16,807Total available &apos; ,- -.      ------     -.74,102.
It should he borne in mind, the statement adds, that the total at any- given date is subject to substantial reductions, owing to the considerable number of men who shortly after reporting are placed in a lower medical category and returned to civil life.Exchange with United States. The Dominion Minister-of Finance (Sir - Thomas White) has returned to Ottawa from Washington, where he has been discussing matters relating to Canadian finance with United States and British officials.The Finance Minister expressed himself as well satisfied with the result of his visit, and announced that he had been able to effect certain arrangements which will have a helpful influence on the exchange situation.He stated that the United States Capital Issues Board have agreed to permit, so far as is compatible with American interests, the issue of Canadian securities in their markets in order to correct partially the. exchange conditions.All such securities must first receive the approval of the Canadian Ministry of Finance for issue in Canada, although it is undesirable for obvious reasons that &quot;the Dominion authorities should recommend them for the favourable consideration of United States officials. Application to issue these securities must bemade personally to Washington by the parties interested or their representatives.Sir Thomas White also stated that the suggestion that Canada should float a large loan in New York in order to help the exchange situation is not desirable, as such action would adversely affect Canadian credit.National Registration.- :The registration of every male and female in the Dominion over 16 years of age was commenced on June 22nd. It is reported-that little confusion and a minimum of dislocation of the industrial efforts of the country occurred, although the effort was a gigantic one. The machinery created by the Government, under the direction of Senator Gideon Robertson, proved entirely equal to the occasion, and the thousands of workers of both sexes, the majority of whom were volunteers, did their work with great efficiency.&quot; Some indication of the magnitude of the undertaking may be gleaned from the fact that in many7 places it was necessary to instal between three and four times the number of registrars at the polling booths during the Federal elections.&quot;In order to minimise interference with work, many large industrial concerns registered their own employees. Little opposition to registration developed, although several cases of this nature were reported from outlying districts in Quebec Province, and from the Six Nations Indian Reserve near Brantford. The French-Canadian Press and clergy strongly urged the people to comply with the requirements of the law, wdiile Sir Wilfred Laurier wrote a letter to a Quebec manufacturer commending the same attitude.   Wide publicity was given to the Opposition Headers letter.&quot; With a Anew to allaying any misapprehension as to the purpose of the registra-tiou. Senator Robertson issued a statement, in which he said that the Government had no intention to conscript labour.&quot; The information obtained regarding the man and woman power of the Dominion will be compiled by the Census and Statistics Bureau, Ottawa, and the first returns will probably be available in about two months&apos; time.&apos;&apos;Extent of Labour Trouble. The following statement has been issued by the Federal Labour Department: &quot;It is. apparent that misapprehension exists as to the extent of labour troubles in the Dominion. By comparison with other countries Canada is still extremely favoured in these matters.&quot;At the present tune, from Cape Breton to Vancouver Island, there are no more than five or six trifling strikes, most of them about a week old, involving in all something less than 250 men and women. None of them is of more than local interest or importance.&quot;Acreage under Wheat. The Dominion Governments estimate, of the crop acreage indicates that in Manitoba there are approximately 2,186,000 sown to wheat this year, being an increase over 19.17 of about 100,000 acres.According to the same estimate, the wheat acreage in Alberta is 3,356 300. - In Manitoba one-and-a-half million acres have been sown to oats, while in Alberta the acreage of this crop is 2,665,000. &quot;      , ,The acreage sown to wheat in the whole of Canada is placed at i 6,080,800, an increase of nearly 1,500,000 acres.
AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Appointment of a Minister in London. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) speaking on June 15th, called attention to a statement by Mr. Higgs (ex-Treasurer of the Commonwealth), about the probable appointment of a Minister to represent the Commonwealth in London, which implied, he said, that Mr. Hughes would he asked to accept the position. Mr. Watt, however, said that he wanted to make it clear that when the Cabinet briefly considered the matter before Mr. Hughes left Australia, they had in mind that it might be advisable, on account of the heavy defence work in London, to appoint a Minister like the other Dominions to co-ordinate the war work. That statement, Mr. Watt added, had no reference to the Prime Minister or to his duties on the Imperial War Cabinet or Conference.Mr. Watt on (Jo-operation of Parties and Pacifists. In moving the adjournment of. the House, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) said that &quot; The Ministry desired as far as administrative work permitted to co-operate with members in recruiting. The news from the front intensified the need for Australia to do its duty to the very end. The heart of Australia, he said, was as sound to-day as when she entered the war. It had happily been possible to banish some asperities from the political arena. The Ministry had shown its desire to fulfil in spirit the promise of consultation given by the Prime Minister at the Governor-Genefafs Conference, and hoped that the co-operation in Parliament would continue in respect of recruiting and the other important problems facing the people of Australia.&quot;Referring to the influence of pacifists on the Government policy in relation to recruiting, the Acting Prime Minister has issued a statement setting out that since the Governor-GeneraTs recruiting conference the Commonwealth Government has deliberately pursued a policy of conciliation in an earnest effort to bridge the gulf that had grown out of the two referendum fights, but recently certain pacifists appeared to have unduly presumed upon this disposition of the Government and had made speeches distinctly harmful to recruiting. One case was, he said, so flagrant that the Government had ordered a prosecution. Mr. Watt asserted emphatically that discouragement of recruiting, particularly at this grave crisis, will not be permitted. Australia having decided to continue the voluntary system, the Govem-ment will see that that system is given a fair chance.Adjournment of Parliament. Before adjourning till August, the Federal Parliament passed Bills relating to Defence, Civil Employment, and Repatriation.Inter-State Labour Congress. The Inter-State Labour Congress opened at Perth last week, when the Leader of the Opposition in the Commonwealth Parliament (Mr. Tudor) attended as a visitor. Responding to a civic welcome, Mr. Tudor ^appealed to the National Labour Leaders &quot; to return to the fold.&quot;According to Press reports, the Congress adopted Resolutions, in favour of complete Australian self-government as a British community with no Imperial federation ; in favour of the Australian High Court being made the final Court of Appeal; and demanding the cessation of the practice of recommending Australians for Imperial honours.Disfranchisement for Seditious Utterances. The Premier of New South Wales (Mr. Holman) announced in the State Parliament, concerning recent utterances, that the Government intended to introduce legislation at an early date to rjrovicle that any person found guilty of seditious utterance should be disfranchised for from four to ten years and be incapable of holding any public office, and also be prohibited for six months from speaking in certain public places. The regulations would not check legitimate freedom, of speech, but would discourage, he said, the mock heroics so rampant to-day.Irish Republican Brotherhood. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) made on June 19th the following statement: &quot;It has recently come to the knowledge of the Government that a division of the organisation known as the Irish Republican Brotherhood has been formed in Australia. This body is being secretly and  systematically organised, and its object is the establishment of an Irish Republic independent &quot;of Great Britain. During the war an -emissary inaugurated the movement.in Australia and then withdrew to another country from which his efforts have since been directed. &apos; Part of the plan of the organisation was to enrol volunteers
who were to be despatched from Australia to America and thence to Ireland to aid in -an armed revolt. The organisation in America was in touch with Germany, and money for hostile purposes was remitted from Australia, The members of this Brotherhood, in certain cases, have been active forces in the Irish National Association. Whilst the declared objects of this latter Association are quite consistent with loyalty :and the employment of constitutional principles and methods, it is clear from some branch reports that sinister attempts have been made by the Republican extremists to pervert these objects. These extremists have been using the Irish National Association as a cloak, apparently without the knowledge of the bulk of the members -of that Association. The facts having been ascertained and carefully considered,&apos;the Government determined to take prompt and decisive measures. Accordingly this week, it simultaneously arrested seven of the ringleaders in this conspiracy and interned them. For the fuller information of the people and in the interests of justice, a public inquiry, as prescribed by the War Precautions Regulations, and presided over by a judge, will be held. While the Government feels that it should inform the people of its action and the reasons for the precautionary steps taken, it wishes to assure them that there is no occasion for alarm.&quot;Shipping Construction. With reference to shipbuilding contracts, the following -official statement has been issued in the Commonwealth : &quot; Further contracts have been made for the construction of four steel ships by Walkers of Maryborough, four steel ships by Poole and Steele of South Australia, and six wooden ships by Kidman and Mayo Bros., of New South Wales. The contracts now made total 26 steamships of 143,000 tons gross and 24 auxiliary wooden ships of 576,000 tons. Ten yards and 27-ships will shortly be in operation.&quot;Resources of Papua. The Lieut.-Governor of Papua (Judge Murray) on his annual visit to Melbourne said that exports of rubber and cocoanuts produced by the plantations formed since the Commonwealth took control in 1907 had been doubling themselves in recent years ; a big copper deposit 17 miles from Port Moresby was being opened up at which the outlook was very good.SOUTH AFRICA.Progress of Recruiting. On the occasion of a body of recruits going into camp, a Reuters message from Cape Town states that a memorable ceremony took place on June 19th, when Mr. G. PI. Murphy, the American consul-General, wished the men God speed. Fifty per cent, of the men, it is stated, bore Dutch names, and the spirit of the recruits was excellent. The Mayor, introducing Mr. Murphy, dwelt, amid great cheering, upon the achievements&apos;of America, and in reply Mr. Murphy said  &quot; The future of the world lay in the hands of the Anglo-Saxon race and their Allies.&quot; Bishop Gaul said . &quot; We are now linked more than ever with the United States,&quot; and the ceremony concluded with the singing of the United States and British National Anthems.   The recruits received an ovation in the streets.Industrial Situation on the Rand. The industrial situation on the Rand was the subject of an important conference on June 16th, under the auspices of the Federation of Trades. It was decided that the whole of the demands to the Chamber of Mines should be presented through the Federation and co-ordinated. The demands will be sent to the branches for consideration, and these bodies will report to the Federation -on July 7th.   The Federation will then seek a conference with the Chamber of Mines.The President of the Chamber of Mines (Mr. E. A, Wallers) in a speech on June 18th said that Johannesburg had lately been full of pessimistic rumours regarding the attitude of labour, but he personally did not share the belief in these rumours, especially those referring to profiteering in the gold industry. It was useless to say that they could fall back on the law of supply and demand. -The times were abnormal, and the basis of the industry was not subject to that law. If -everyone was going to act on that assumption they would come to grief.The President of the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce (Mr. Sturrock) is reported by The Times (London) correspondent as expressing on June 21st an optimistic view of the Rand labour situation. He repudiated, it is reported, the MayoFs recent &quot;volcano&quot; analogy, and declared that his own conviction was that in -anticipating trouble industrially they were not only misjudging the symptoms but
doing serious injustice to the great body of industrial employes. In his opinion the-settlements recently arrived at in the furniture, building, and tailoring trades justified the view that &quot;the great majority of the industrial employes on the Rand will not support, let alone emulate, the example of the municipal employes.&quot;Europeans in South Africa. A recent census of the European population cdves the following totals: Cape Province, 580,771, an increase of 35,103 compared with 1011 ; Natal, 120,465, an increase of 22,619 ; Transvaal, 497,236, an increase of 77,3,52; Orange Free State, 181,292, an increase of 6,469. Total for the Union including travellers, 1,418,060, an increase of 141,818, compared with 1911.INDIA.(Excluding external affairs, which are dealt luith in the Eastern Report.)Political Conditions. It is officially reported that the political calm has been a little disturbed by incidents which occurred at the Bombay War Conference on June 10th (vide Report No. 73), when Mr. Tilak and a few other Home Rulers left the meeting as a protest against Lord Willingdon&apos;s ruling that political discussion was out of place at the Conference and would not be permitted.Meantime Mr. Tiiak and his followers have issued a statement to the Bress-explaining their position, in the course of which they allege that they would have been hopelessly compromised had they acted otherwise, that the procedure was peculiarly inequitable and unfair, and that Lord Willingclon&apos;s exercise of his authority as chairman was indefensible. They claim that they were entitled to the opportunity of a reply to the CfovernoFs gratuitous and provocative attack on Home Rule.Commenting on the above statement, the Bom bay correspondent of The Times-(London) says it represents the Home Rule point of. view, but that Mr. Tilak&apos;s-arguments and tactics are disapproved by Bombay v-as strikingly demonstrated on June 13th at a War Loan meeting which the Home Rulers boycotted. The greatest enthusiasm prevailed, and &apos; the meeting gave - Lord Willingdon the heartiest reception.ddiere is reason to suppose, the correspondent adds, that the GovernoFs action,, which has led to the exposure of the conditional loyalty of the Home Rulers, has had excellent results throughout the Presidency.Russian Blue Book on India. Information has reached the British Government that the Russian Kommissariat of Foreign Affairs has published.a Blue Book on India containing documents from the Russian archives from 1910 to 1917. These are-chiefly reports of Russian Consuls at Calcutta, and though no secrets are revealed, certain confidential information is. given. &apos; It is reported by the British Agent at Moscow that the publication of this Blue Book has proved a fiasco.FOREIGN COLONIES.Fate of German Colonies-Tile Eclair referring to the article in the London Times on the meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet, called attention in a recent issue-to the necessity of dealing with Colonial questions at the proper moment from the European point of view, if not from that of humanity, Avith France as a participant in. the deliberations, whatever might be the geographical situation of the Germam colonies in cpiestion.
