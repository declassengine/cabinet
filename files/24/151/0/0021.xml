SECRET.APPRECIATION OP THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 70.PART I. -BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Canada.The Parliamentary Session which has just ended was remarkable in many ways. This Session was the first held in the Dominion with a Union Government in power, and the variety of subjects dealt with form in themselves a tribute to the vigour of the new administration. Sir R. Borden has been able to count upon a full measure of Parliamentary support, and only once did any real menace from the Unionist Benches show itself, viz., on the subject of hereditary titles. A mere threat of resignation sufficed to steady the situation.It is interesting to note that the Government intend to retain Mr. P. E. Blond in, though without a seat&quot;in Parliament, in his position as Postmaster-General, at any rate, it seems, while he is serving at the front. This decision means that French-Canada will after all be represented in the Cabinet.It is satisfactory to note that the Winnipeg strike is at an end.Australian Commonwealth.Some notable speeches have been delivered by the Acting Prime Minister, Mr. Watt. Those dealing with the interests of Australasia in territorial acquisitions in the Pacific as &quot;the white outpost of the Southern Seas,&quot; and also with the position of the Commonwealth in the Empire, merit special attention.The observations of the Minister for Defence upon the importance of Parliamentary institutions in the present crisis should not be lost sight of.Other items worthy of attention under this heading are those relating to recruiting and aviation matters, the split in the New South Wades Labour ranks in connection with the anti-war attitude of certain members, and the statement about war loans.South Africa.General Botha&apos;s observations on the relations of the Dutch and English explain some of the difficulties the Prime Minister has to meet. The position of lower-grade gold mines is important both from an Imperial and national standpoint.Germany in Africa.The observations of Herr Dernburg on the supply of raw materials and the Non-ferrous Metals Bill show the importance that is being attached by German publicists to the future of Germany in Africa. This subject is also referred to in Part II., under Peace Discussions, Germany.G. G. A.May 30th, 1.918.

PART   I. -BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Prorogation of Parliament ;. Work of the Session.-Th.e first session of CanatiVs thirteenth Parliament was prorogued last week alter lasting for 47 days.In the course of his Speech from the Throne the Governor-General referred to the sinister purpose of the enemy which had been clearly revealed by the military domination founded upon his Eastern success, and the application to the Dominion was given in these words : &quot; The unmistakeable menace to our national liberties and safety thus disclosed cannot fail to strengthen the resolution of our people, who abide the issue with unshaken faith in their high cause, consecrated by the sacrifice of those who have died that freedom, faith and justice may endure.&quot;As to the provision of the necessary reinforcements, the Speech continued :  &quot;The readjustments you authorised in the Military Service Law will provide the reinforcements and reserves so urgently needed to support and maintain all arms of the service at full strength without unduly interfering with the demands essential to production.&quot;The interest of the Session primarily arose from the fact that it was the first meeting of Parliament under the new Union Government, but a number of important matters arising out of the war were discussed during this Session. Among these may be mentioned : the Government^ decision to cancel exemptions granted to men between 20 and 22, regardless of occupation ; the war appropriation of half a billion dollars ; the regulations governing the granting of pensions to disabled soldiers and dependants of those killed in the war ; the Federal taxation measures ; woman franchise.; the Daylight Saving Act; the amendment, to the Civil Service Act, abolishing political patronage ; and the endorsement of the Government policj^ regarding the award of titles to residents in Canada.On the last day of the Session the Leader of the Opposition (Sir W. Laurier) endeavoured to test the feeling of the House on the War-time Elections Act, and moved a resolution that the Act should be repealed. The motion, however, though coming as a complete surprise, did not disclose any serious division of opinion amongst Government supporters, as it only secured the support^ of one Unionist, Mr. W. S. Fielding, and was defeated by 74 votes to 53.Opposition Gliarges regarding Soldier&apos;s Votes.   Before the prorogation of Parlia-nient almost the. whole time of the sitting of the House on May 22ncl was given to a discussion upon the voting of oversea soldiers at the last Federal election, as the Opposition asked in a motion for an investigation into what their members termed &quot; corrupt practices and frauds..&quot; The mover of the resolution based his demand for an investigation on 32 alleged charges of -irregularities in voting. He asserted that Canadian military officers in England co-operated with the election officers in the commission of frauds ; that soldiers in the training camps in England were encouraged to select ridings to which their votes were to be applied, that soldiers were intimidated by their superiors, &amp;c. ; and he read a list of names of men who were alleged to have voted for constituencies in which they were not entitled to vote.In reply, the Secretary of State (Mr. Martin Burrell), pointed out that the Government, without a single vote of the soldiers, was emphatically supported by the civilian, population of Canada at the elections in December. He observed that the Opposition charges concerned only the voting in England, which was conducted on the same lines as in Canada and France, where no complaints had been made.   The
6 oMinister-emphasised the point that no faith could he placed in the accusations of: the Opposition, which were brought forward under the auspices of Mr. Preston, the Opposition election agent oversea. This gentlemaids electioneering methods, Mr. Burrell -stated, included an advertisement in a Welsh newspaper calling upon the soldiers to &quot;Vote for Sir Wilfred Laurjer and conscription/&apos; The Resolution for a judicial investigation was rejected by a vote of 92 to 61.Hereditary Titles. With reference to the deflate on April 8th,-when a Resolution was moved in the House of Commons in favour of petitioning His Majesty the King to grant no more hereditary titles in Canada, and the announcement, of the Government policy on the subject (vide Report No. 63), the matter was carried further last week, when a Unionist Member (Mr. Richardson, representing Springfield, Man.),-- submitted an amendment calling upon His Majesty to confer no titles whatever upon Canadians domiciled in the Dominion. In the course of the discussion the Prime. Minister adhered to the policy he had previously outlined (vide Report No. 63), and he stated that if the Government policy were defeated lie would treat it as equivalent to a vote of want of confidence, and would tender his resignation. He also announced that the British Government desired to have the whole question reserved for consideration during the forthcoming Imperial Conference in London, and they undertook meantime to confer no titles in Canada, On the mover offering to withdraw his amendment, the Opposition refused to allow him to do so, and the division resulted in a Government majority of 33, the vote being 104 in favour and 71 against.Postmaster-General. In the discussion on the Post Office Estimates in Parliament, the Opposition raised objection to the retention of the office of Postmaster-General by Mr. P. E. Blondin, the French-Canadian Conservative Minister who was defeated in the recent election. The Minister of Trade and Commerce (Sir George Foster), in replying, said that Mr. Blondin was at present playing a part in the war oversea, and he did not think therefore that people would find fault with the course tile Government had adopted.Empire Day in Montreal. The Empire Da3* celebrations in Montreal were remark-able for the fact of the fraternisation of English, French and Irish Canadians. Mr. Clarion, President of the St. George Society, Mr. Morin, President of St. Jean Baptiste Society, and Mr. J. P. Hackett, representing the Irish-Canadians, all spoke from the same platform to a crowd of 3,000. Two hundred troops paraded for the ceremony, half coming from the English depot, and half from the French.Winnipeg Strike. The most serious strike in the history of the City is now at an end and Senator Gideon Robertson on behalf of the Dominion - Government has announced that he persuaded the strikers and the City Council each to make concessions which made a settlement possible. Under the agreement the strikers will be reinstated under a wage schedule and any future disputes will be settled by a Board of Inquiry.Dominion Sailors for Mercantile Fleet. The Quebec division of the Navy League of Canada is endeavouring to secure a membership of 25,000, the President giving as . the reason that the great natiou of Canada must have its own mercantile fleet,   &apos;&quot; The one chief object of our division,&quot; he said, &quot; is to have enough Canadian sailors to man Canadian ships.&apos;A US.TRALIA N COMMONW EA1 ,TH.The Pacific and Territorial Changes : Confidence in Mr. Tloyd George. -The acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) in an address last week before the Australian Women&apos;s National League, emphasised the importance of not permitting the control of. the Pacific Islands to return to Germany. He said Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cook would put Australia^ view firmly and unmistakeably before the statesmen of Great Britain. Some said that Great Britain should seek no territorial aggrandisement, but Air. Watt declared that this was a most dangerous position so far as.Australia was concerned. The Australian representatives, lie said, could tell the statesmen of the Allies that the5681-an A 2
question of holding the islands taken from Germany meant either happiness or anxiety for the Australian community ; withdrawal from the islands might mean danger or even ruin to Australia. -A fact not always appreciated was that if Australia and New Zealand were to constitute the great white outpost of the southern seas, they must keep the captured adjacent islands from Germany and retain them in the possession of the Allies.The above gathering passed amid great, enthusiasm a motion of confidence in Mr. Lloyd George. Mr. Watt, commenting on this; said they should be proud to have statesmen like Mr. Lloyd George, in honour of whom it would be worthy to make a statue of gold.Position of Australia in the Empire. Speaking at the Empire Day celebration in Melbourne Town Hall, the Acting Prime Minister outlined the position of the Commonwealth in the Empire, with special reference to those who advocated a policy of isolation. &quot; The British Empire/&apos; said Mr. Watt, &quot;is Australians only shield. There are some spoiled fools in this country who wantonly set at defiance the accumulated testimony of all the ages when they lead their brothers and sisters to believe that Australia can live a life unto herself amid the clashing forces of the world.&quot;The Minister of Defence on Powers of Parliament. The Minister of Defence (Senator Pearce) in a speech at Melbourne on May 19th, deprecated the tendency in some quarters to sneer at Parliaments, declaring that if ever there was a time when parliamentary institutions should be cherished it was now. Those institutions were being attacked not merely by the Kaiser and his army, they were being attacked from within. &quot;There is an attempt,&quot; he said, &quot; in this country and in the country from which our fathers came to wrest, from Parliament and political institutions the power of Govern-ment, and place it in the hands of irresponsible cliques.&quot; The fight, he said, had been begun in the United Kingdom, and tlie history of it in. Australia for the last three years was well known. The Minister declared that the fight had for long been conducted underground in secret, but to-day it was out in the open, and there was a clarion call for every man and woman who was a Britisher to rake an interest in this question, and to take part in the fight.War Loans. The acting Prime Minister in moving the Second Reading of the War Loans Bill in the House of Representatives last week, said that the latest reliable figures showed that war loans raised in the Commonwealth totalled 148,425,110?. He mentioned that war loans from Great Britain amounted do 49,082,0597., the loans raised in London for the States being twelve millions ; this and other loans for Commonwealth works, Northern territory, Railway, &amp;c, making an entire total of 226,036,2387. Mr. Watt mentioned that 778,0007. were being spent, this financial year in the purchase and construction of ships, and he estimated that about two and a half millions would be spent in 1918-19.Progress of Becruiting. The Minister for Recruiting (Mr. Orchard) has made an optimistic statement, regarding the revival of recruiting on bis return from an extended visit to New South Wales and Queensland.It was officially reported last week that the complete figures for the week&apos;s recruiting indicated that the number enrolled was the best.since January of last year, and considerably over the total for the previous week. The figures show.an increase in all States.&apos; Enlistment of Persons under 19. In the House of Representatives on. May 24th, the Acting Prime Minister announced that the Cabinet had decided that (1) persons under the age of 19 are not to be enlisted without the-consent of parents, (2) where sons are serving with the Australian Imperial Forces, and the remaining son in Australia desires to enlist he must have his parents consent in writing if under twenty-one, (3) where, subject to these provisions, sons under twenty-one have enlisted without their parents consent, the parents could lodge with the District Commandant an objection within 10 clays of the son joining the camp ; such objection must be forwarded to the State Recruiting Committee for its decision.A motion in the House of Representatives condemning the Government in connection with the enlistment of minors, which was proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, was rejected by 30 votes to 13.
Progress ,of Aviation.-^-The Minister for Defence lias announced that the Common-wealth Cabinet have approved the proposal greatly to increase aeroplane construction in Australia. Lieutenant-Colonel Renolds with his Staff is returning to Australia to take command of the Central Flight School at Point Cook, Victoria, while Major Harrison is proceeding to England in order to gain up-to-date experience of aviation and aeroplane construction.Trades Unions and War Measures. It appears likely that there will be a;split in the New South Wales Labour Council, as a result of a meeting about a fortnight ago when a recruiting motion was ruled out of order. The officials of 20 Trades Unions in Sydney have decided to call a Conference with a view to organising an industrial body pledged to act in accordance with the adopted policy of the Trades Union movement. The Secretary of the Union of Printing Employes has declared that it is necessary for the Union movement generally.to show itself in accord with its leaders and ready to dissociate itself from anti-war proposals.The New South Wales Courts have refused the application of the Minister for Labour to re-register the first of the Industrial Unions which were de-registered for participation in last year&apos;s strike. The Judge held that the re-registration must be done by Parliament as the matter was political rather than industrial. The State Cabinet have decided to call a special session of Parliament to deal with the re-registration of the, 15 unions de-registered as a result of the recent strike.SOUTH AFRICA.Relations of Dutch and English. In his speech to the South African Party - Con-gress (vide Report No. 69) important references were made by the Prime Minister (General Botha) to the relations between Dutch and English, and he dwelt on the grave harm done to the country&apos;s. interests by English and Dutch extremists. He was pleased to say, however, that a number - of - leading English South African papers had preached a spirit of toleration, co-operation, and forbearance, but others, particularly one in Natal, had created more Nationalists than any other paper or speaker, and had alienated much sympathy from the Empire. On the other hand there was an element causing bitterness and ill-feeling among the English popula-tion. He expressed himself as gratified, however, by the &quot;moderation and tolerance of his followers, who were thereby rendering a great service to their country. There was also a strong element among the English section standing for moderation, and it was growing daily. The Boer war had caused both sections to respect each other. In order to achieve the great destiny which they hoped, General Botha added in conclusion, they must all unite together.Position of Lower Grade Mines. The Union Government have represented to the British Government that the increase in working costs has made the position of the lower grade gold mines very precarious, and may necessitate an early cessation of their activities. It is pointed out that about 1-1 mines, with an annual output of 7,000,000 per annum of gold are realising on an average less than Is. per ton profit and in some cases an actual loss. The Union Government have therefore given the matter serious consideration on account- of maintaining the gold output from an Imperial standpoint and of preventing the loss of emplojnnent resulting from closing-down the mines. In the 1918 Session of Parliament, it is mentioned, a Select Committee -&quot;enquired into the position, and a proposal appearing in their Report, which was, made by the Chamber of Mines, turns on the sum charged by the Bank of England, by arrangement with the British Government, for freight and insurance on gold bullion. The present charge is 11. 5s. per cent, on the value of the gold as against the pre-war charge of 7s. Qd. per cent. This produces -1-60,OOOL per annum which is a charge on the gold mining industry. As the war risk is less than was anticipated, the Union Ministers presume that a large sum paid for insurance must have accumulated and been earning interest, and they therefore suggest that while the Chamber of Mines should continue to pay at the rate of 11. 5s. per cent., a sum of 11-0,0001., or about 7s. 6d. per cent, of the value of the gold, should be handed over to the-Union Government to be used by them for assisting the poorer mines. The Ministers ask that representations may be made to the Bank of England on the subject.
INDIA.(Excluding external affairs, ichich. are decdt icitli in the Eastern Report.)Political Conditions. Public interest throughout India has been mainly confined to the Delhi Conference of April 27th and its recommendations, to the action taken on them by the Government of India, and to the Provincial Conferences which followed. The general results have been satisfactory and the tone of the Indian Press has, for the time being at least, improved.Session of Imperial Legislative Council. In a despatch to the London Times the correspondent of that journal at Delhi points out that the last session of the Imperial Legislative Council was notable in several respects. Attention is called to the fact that the &quot;Viceroy in his closing speech referred to the practice inaugurated this year of official members taking a larger share in the debates and the proceedings. &quot; It-is a constant source of irritation to the non-official members,&quot; His Excellency is quoted as saying, &quot; that they are up against a silent phalanx of votes.&quot; The Government, however, he reminded the Council, must have power to carry their legislative proposals ; and inasmuch as legislation is carried by votes they would not relinquish their hold on the official vote. But within those limits it was his desire more and more to give the official element a greater part in the deliberations, and so give more reality to the proceedings.In regard to one important subject, the correspondent writes, officials were given a free hand to vote as they pleased, with the result that a clause of the Income Tax Bill was defeated by a combination which comprised 17 non-official Indian members and 13 officials. It is stated that the debate revealed a remarkable divergence of opinion amongst the Indian members ; and that the official members,were actuated in the. main in their opposition to the clause by the belief that if carried it might-hinder recruiting.FOREIGN COLONIES IN AFRICA.GERMANY IN AFRICA.Supply of Raw Materials. Herr Dernberg, the former German Colonial Secretary, in the course of an article in the Neue Freie Presse indicates that not even the return-of all the German colonies, &quot; with a good slice of Africa thrown in,&quot; would enable the Central Powers to satisfy their own requirements in raw material. Neutral sources, he says, of supply are scarce and inadequate. The ex-Minister reminds his readers that with few exceptions the whole of the rest of the world has ranged itself on the side of Germany&apos;s enemies, and there is nothing to prevent all these countries from maintaining their war legislation after the conclusion of peace.&quot; England and her Dominions,&quot; Herr Dernberg adds, &quot; have already made a beginning by recently adopting the Non-Ferrous Metals Act, which provides that for five years after the conclusion of peace all non-ferrous metals in the British Empire  that is to say, just the very metals that we need, may be sold only in accordance with the prescriptions of the Board of Trade. Notwithstanding the tremendously flourishing growth of our substitute industry, the peace in the East will not be able to afford us fully equivalent compensation for the trade with three-quarters of the world and the-failure of these sources of raw materials. As there is still a large number of people who look at things only from the point of view of the situation as presented by the war map in Europe, this reminder is not inappropriate. The coming-peace, therefore, must include as one of its most important points the reopening and permanant keeping open of the market and raw material areas for the Central Powers,, who also for many years past have shown an oversea bias-r-in a word, the freedom of the seas must be secured.&quot;
