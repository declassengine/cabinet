SECRET.A PP.! i ECIATIO N OP THE &quot;ATT AO 11 ED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 09. &apos;     &quot;PART I.   BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Canada.The necessity of Sir R. Borden&apos;s Ministerial colleagues returning to Canada from the Imperial War Conference not later than the end of June will limit discussion to urgent matters.The Prime Ministers statement on railway policy is important, and indicates the gradual taking over by the Government of all the chief railways of Canada, except the Canadian Pacific Railway.The unfavourable balance of the Dominioids trade with the United States has been the subject of an interesting statement by the Minister of Finance, who indicates that large additional war contracts for munitions, &amp;c, will be placed in the Dominion.The French offers to Dominion shipbuilders to purchase vessels at prices in excess of those sanctioned under the Government shipbuilding programme have evidently caused some embarrassment to Canadian Ministers.The possible formation of a French Canadian Brigade is of in feres!. It is satisfactory to note that the Quebec response to the new call-up is excellent.Idle attitude of the Canadian Trades and Labour Congress in denving that it is a political organisation is important, coming as it does from the most powerful Labour organisation in the Dominion.Australian Commoxwealttt.The statement of the Acting Prime Minister about the Pacific again indicates the attitude which may be anticipated from the delegates who will shortly arrive in London.   (Vide also Report No. 66.)The new spirit which is rexiorted Iiy the Director of Recruiting to ha\-e shown itself in connection with the recruiting rally is very satisfactory. The fact that the Premier of Queensland is actively engaged in raising the &quot; Ryan Thousand &quot; is a factor in the situation which could hardly have been contemplated before the Governor-GeneraTs Recruiting Conference.A good deal was made in the Press of the communication by the Premier of Queensland of a Home Rule and Anti-conscription Resolution to De Valera, but the significance of the incident is greatly modified by the fact that the Resolution was
only sent to the Sinn Fein leader as it was to other Members of Parliament likely to be interested.The attitude of a representative section of the Australian Natives Association towards hereditary titles is interesting, and agrees with views very generally expressed by responsible people in Canada.South Africa.The statement of the Prime Minister to the South African Party Congress is important. The references to Republicanism and the British connection are emphatic. General Botha&apos;s observations about conscription and an Imperial Parliament require attention.G. G. A.May 23rd, 1918.

PART I. BRITISH EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING  DOMINIONS.CANADA.Imperial War Conference. The Prime. Minister (Sir R. Borden) has informed the British Government that his colleagues who accompany him to London must leave on their return to Canada not later than the end of Jane. In these circumstances Sir R. Borden suggests that the proceedings of the Imperial War Conference may he expedited and only urgent matters discussed.Government Railway Policy.- -The anticipated statement upon Railway Policy was made by the Prime Minister in the Canadian House of Commons last week, and it has aroused great interest throughout the Dominion. After surveying the history of railroad transportation in Canada, Sir R. Borden said, in speaking of the future : &quot; It may be possible, and, indeed, &quot;I think it is highly probable, that at some later date, but not in the immediate future, all laud transportation facilities in Canada in the shape of railways may, so far as their operation at.least is concerned, be amal-gamated into one system, and carried on under one management.&quot;As to the immediate action of the Government, Sir R. Borden stated that the intention was to run the Canadian Northern as a Corporation under a Board of Directors. This Board would not be directly under any one Government Department, and would be free from all political influence and patronage. The Bremier further announced that he hoped to bring under the same organisation as that which would operate the Canadian Northern all the existing Government railroads, including the Inter-Colonial and the National Transcontinental. In reply to criticism as to the Government having not yet taken over the Canadian Northern system, Sir R. Borden stated that this seep was not possible until the arbitration negotiations now pending had been concluded. The award of the Board was expected before June 1 st, but a time limit had been fixed extending that date.Regarding the Grand Trunk Pacific, the Prime Minister observed that it was inevitable that this railway should be taken over by the country. This practically involved the accpiisition of the Grand Trunk proper, with which company.negotia-tions had been in progress for some time. One difficulty he mentioned with reference to the old Grand Trunk lines was that so much of the system was in the United States. This made expropriation impracticable, and the only way to the desired end was by negotiation. Sir R. Borden concluded by saying, that members of the Sub-Committee of the Cabinet (Mr. Meighen and Mr. Calder) were going to England within the next few months, and further negotiations would be conducted by them while oversea. At the next Session of Parliament, he added, the Government would be prepared, he hoped, to submit a plan embracing the operation of all the chief railways in Canada, with the exception of the Canadian Pacific.,Bate of Exchange loith United Slates. -The Dominion Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas white) has returned to Canada from New York, where he has been engaged for the past month in negotiations with a view to correcting the unfavourable balance of the Doniinioirs trade with the United States. In an interview, last week, Sir T. white stated that Canadians must deny themselves luxuries in order to keep the rate of exchange more nearly normal. He added that it was probable that large additional war contracts for munitions and other supplies would be placed in Canada.French Offers to Shipbuilders.-The Dominion Government have informed the British Government&quot; that offers are being made to Canadian shipbiulders on behalf of the French Government for the purchase of tonnage at prices much in excess of those allowed under the Government shipbuilding programme. As the policy agreed upon with the British authorities does not permit of ships being built in Canada for foreign
registry, considerable dissatisfaction has arisen in the matter, and the Dominion Government urge that the French Government should be asked to desist from their action.French Canadian Brigade and Enlistments. A matter which &apos; Mr. Blondin (as Postmaster-General) stated in London last year would have a considerable effect, upon French-Canadian opinion in relation to recruiting in Quebec, was referred to by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons last week, when he stated that the proposal to establish a French-Canadian Brigade had been taken up with Sir Arthur Currie. The Premier stated that the attitude of the Government was sympathetic towards the proposal, and the Brigade would be raised if military exigencies permitted.The Quebec newspaper L&apos;Evenement, in commenting upon this matter, s&amp;ys : &quot;We hope to see the long-desired union of.French-Canadian forces, and a Ffench-Canadian Brigade at the front. Up to now the excuse has been that there were not enough French-Canadian soldiers for such an organisation, and we must admit that the reason was a good one .... To-day, however, all this is changed. Hundreds of thousands of our young compatriots have been called to the colours, and we believe there will be enough soldiers of our race in France to form a Brigade exclusiveD of French-Canadians.&quot;The General Officer Commanding the Quebec district has expressed his delight to see how the young French Canadians who are affected by the new Order-in-Council are responding to the call. The officer in charge of the administration of the Military Service Act in Quebec Province has declared &quot; Quebec is now lining up with the other Provinces.&quot;The Yukon Seal. The decision of the Privileges and &quot;Elections Committee of the Dominion House of Commons to submit the question of including or excluding the soldiers&apos; votes which were cast in the Yukon election to a legal tribunal (vide Report No. 08) has been considered by the House itself, and the recommendation of the Committee was refused by a vote of 113 to 70. ddie motion to refer the case back to the Committee was adopted without a division, and the Committee thereupon decided that the soldiers&apos; votes were applicable. This means that the Unionist will be returned.Trade and, Labour Congress and Air: Henderson. A letter from the Secretary of the Canadian Trades and Labour Congress was read at a recent meeting of the Toronto and District Labour Council, and according to the published report this letter declared that the Congress was not a political organisation and could not assume responsibility for inviting Mr. Arthur Henderson to Canada.Strikes in Winnipeg. Owing to the City Council deciding not to grant the demands recently made by their electricians and waterworks men, over 175 firemen have gone out on strike, leaving the Department almost unmanned. Efforts are being made to raise, a citizen volunteer force. The employes of the Street Railway and the telephone girls of the City have also gone on strike in sympathy with the civic employes who are already out.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Imperial War Cabinet and Conference: further Subject for discussion, With regard to the subjects for discussion at the forthcoming meetings in London, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Hughes) telegraphed on May 7th that besides the subjects already named (vide Report No. 61) he wished to raise the question of the channels of communication between the Dominions and the United Kingdom.War Situation and the Pacific. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) in a speech delivered on May 15th, emphasised the gravity of the war situation and the necessity56s1--la A 2
for Australia to put forth every ounce of energy to avert defeat. On the subject of returning the captured territory in the Pacific to Germany, Mr. Watt asked : &quot; Are we to lose those islands captured for Australia by our splendid men? Are we in a generous Christianlike spirit to give them back to Germany so that she may cause havoc to those who come after us ? &quot;India-Australian Trade : serious position. The Commonwealth Government have informed the British authorities of the serious position which has resulted from the withdrawal of vessels from the India-Australian trade without notice. It is pointed out that jute goods are necessary in connection with the carriage of wool, wheat, meat, and other British purchases. The corn sacks to enable wheat to be sent to the seaboard, the linseed necessary for the production of paint oils and the feeding of stock, can only be obtained from India. It is urgently7 asked that a^essels may be provided at the earliest moment to meet these necessities. It is considered that 27 full cargoes would be wanted between the present time and the end of the year.Recruiting. The Director-General of Recruiting (Mr. Mackinnon) states that a new spirit is manifest throughout Australia with regard to recruiting.The Premier of Queensland (Mr. Ryan) is arranging to tour the State in an appeal for recruits. The Minister for Recruiting (Mr. Orchard) has announced that every man enlisting in Queensland will be asked if he desires to join the &quot; Ryan Thousand &quot; ; if not he will go into ordinary reinforcements.Queensland and Home Ride for Ireland. AVith regard to the&apos;Resolution which was recently passed in Queensland on the proposal of the Archbishop of Brisbane, seconded by the Premier of the State, protesting against the extension of the Man-Power Act to Ireland and urging the British Government to establish immediately in Ireland such a measure of Home Rule as would be acceptable to the majority of the people, it is to be noted that though the Irish Nationalist and other newspapers announced that the Sinn Fein leader had received the telegram from the Premier of Queensland, a copy of the telegram was in fact sent through the Agent-General&apos;s office in London to De Valera as a Member of Parliament (and not as the Sinn Fein leader) in the same way that it was sent to other Members interested in the question.Flinders By-election. At the by-election for Flinders, rendered necessary through the retirement of Sir W. Irvine on his accepting the Chief Justiceship of Victoria, the Nationalist candidate has been returned with a majority of more than 6,0,00 over his &apos; Labour opponent. It is to be observed that at the last General Election Sir W. Irvine, who fought his election on the conscription issue, obtained a majority of 7,000, having, increased it to that figure from the previous one of 1,400.II eredilary Titles. A resolution has been passed by the Board of Directors of the Australian Natives Association in Victoria and South Australia affirming that the creation of a system of hereditary titles is undemocratic.Prisoners of War. The Minister for Defence has issued a statement showing the number of Australian prisoners of war held by the enemy on February 28th. These figures show the prisoners taken in the following theatres of war, viz. :  		Officers.	MenFrance		-   74	2,649Dardanelles		-     6	41Mesopotamia	-	-    2	8Egypt		-    4	40	Total	-   86	2,738Pensions and Income Tax. At the State Premiers&apos; Conference it has -been decided that pensions granted for active service in the naval and military forces shall be exempted from income tax.
NEW ZEALAND.Gold and Scheelite Production. The Dominion Government have inquired whether The British Government still hold the view that the production of gold and scheelite should he regarded as sufficiently essential to justify the continued exemption of unmarried miners employed in such production.SOUTH AFRICA.Prime. Minister on Republicanism, Conscription, and an Imperial Parliament.  The Prime Minister (General Botha) seized the occasion of the South Africa Party Congress at Pretoria to deliver, as on past occasions of the meetings of the Congress, an important speech on various matters of general policy. .  .Dealing firstly with the subject of Republicanism, General Botha reiterated jus grave warning that a Republic could only be established by force of arms. He continued : &quot; Mr. Hertzog in Parliament had said that he only favoured a-Republic in theory, yet at Paarl, when he addressed the students, why did he incite these young children to a condition of affairs which must end in blood and tears?- Again, at Smith held, Mr. Hertzog saug a different tune, admitting that only by the aid of the two sections of the people could a Republic be attained. The whole propaganda was nothing but an attempt to gain votes. Mr. Hertzog and his friends had been playing with lire, and Mr. Hertzog had now called a halt,&quot;After the Boer War they nearly despaired, in their deep sorrow and mourning, but to-day could they be regarded as an oppressed nation? In everything they could see GocPs hand. A great and contented South Africa had been established. Their Union was born out of the brain of the Afrikander, not the Englishman. To talk of South Africa as an oppressed nation was nonsense, and showed great ignorance. There must be an end to all talk of raising commandoes. They could not allow that kind of thing to go on.&quot;General Botha appealed to his followers not to wait until it should be necessary for the Government to. proclaim martirl lav/ in their districts. They must all get this kind of talk stopped, otherwise the greatest danger threatened South Africa, General Botha then made a solemn appeal for reunion, and declared that everyone should try to bring it about.As to the position of his followers of the South African Party in the matter of Republicanism, the Premier Said: &quot;Some people urged the South African Party to embody Rejmbliean propaganda in its programme, but they should stand by the Constitution, which was their Magna Carta, born out of the wishes of the two sections of the population. They would never get a majority of both the English and Dutch sections in favour of a Republic.&quot;Regarding British action in the past, General Botha said : &quot; The propagandists based their action on the statement of Mr. Lloyd George that he deprecated what England had done.to South Africa in the Boer War, but after the.war England had given South Africa every opportunity, to work out her own salvation. From England there was nothing to fear.   England was their friend and helper to-clay.&quot;Dealing with General Hertzog&apos;s allegation that the Union Parliament was sub-^ servient to the British Parliament, General Botha said it was absolutely untrue that the British Parliament- could pass a conscription law for South Africa, &quot; South Africa,&quot; he continued, &quot; would never tolerate such a measure. The only body that could pass laws for South Africa was the South African Parliament, All the British Government could do was to withdraw the South African Constitution by compulsion, but who would dream of such a step ? &quot;On the question of the establishment of an Imperial Parliament (to which General Hertzog also referred in his Smithfield speech, vide Report No. 67) the Prime Minister asked : &quot; Who would favour such a Parliament, in which they would naturally be in the minority regarding the question of conscription ? He would never agree to a conscription measure in South Africa to force men to go to the front.&quot;In conclusion General Botha declared : &quot; All must work for the establishment of a .great South African people in which the two sections stood on a footing of absolute equality, trust, confidence, and mutual goodwill.&quot;
INDIA.(Excluding external affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Delhi Conference Resolutions. Owing to the absence of tlie Government in the hills and to the hot weather dispersal, it is reported in the Press that the schemes for executing the Delhi Conference Resolutions are not at present prominent, but that much preparatory organisation is proceeding, especially in Calcutta, to reach all classes of the community.. It is stated in the Press that the Maharani of Bhavnagar has instituted a fund amongst the Native States and their Durbars to commemorate Lady Willingclon&apos;s work for Indian womanhood. The interest in the fund during&apos;the war will be used for the relief of sick and wounded Indian soldiers.Home Riders and Communication with Enemy.- On May 8th judgment was. delivered in the case of Sitarama Dyer, who, according to Press reports, has been sentenced to seven years&apos; rigorous imprisonment under the Defence of India Act and to five years under the Indian Penal Code for attempting, as an influential member of the Home Rule League, to hold communication with the enemy and for conspiring to deprive the King-Emperor of the sovereignty of India. The accused, it is stated, was for 12 years a Revenue Inspector, and he wrote letters to high officials in Germany urging that the enemy should invade India and promising that assistance would be given by 400 Home Rule Leagues.
