SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 58.PART I.   BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.The consultation that is taking place with the Dominions regarding the post-war economic relationship of the British Empire with enemy, allied, and neutral countries is of considerable importance. .Canada.Now that the result of the soldiers&apos; vote in England has been made known, the Union Government, when it meets the new Parliament on March 18th, will possess a majority of at least 70, and probably 71, according to the return of The Yukon. The table that is given in this Report of the voting of civilians and soldiers in the various Provinces is of interest, and indicates how strongly the men in the trenches, even from the Province of Quebec, are in favour of the Government,The cordial relationship which the war is bringing about between Canada and the United States is shown again in this Report. Attention is called to the satisfactory informal consultation between Lord Reading and Sir Robert Borden regarding the question of Japanese intervention in Siberia.Australian . Commonwealth.The appointment of an impartial tribunal to determine the number of reinforce-ments necessary to maintain the Australian Divisions should put an end to the party recriminations that have taken place in connection with this subject.It is satisfactory to note that the Conference of Manufacturers have endorsed almost every item of the Governments programme for the organisation of trade and industry.The suggestion of the Commonwealth Government that matters connected with the supply of wool to the United States may cause discontent in Australia, similar to that produced amongst the farmers in South Africa, requires careful attention.The position taken up by Mr. Hughes about the supply of Australian war trophies to the Imperial War Museum shows the determination of Commonwealth Ministers to do all that is possible to stimulate a true national patriotism.Some indication of the policies advocated in several of the States is given in the Report, [p.t.o.
New Zealand.The attitude of the Dominion Government towards the settlement of Japanese in Samoa is of far-reaching importance.South Africa.The motion to grant leave of absence to General Smuts called forth some strong-tributes to the soldier-statesman in the Union House of Assembly. These were brought into better relief by the usual anti-Empire attitude of a few of the Nationalists.The combination of such men as Mr. Merriman, Colonel Creswell, and Mr.. Duncan in opposition to the further importation of coloured labourers from tropical Africa is significant.German Africa.The latest declaration of Dr. Solf serves to keep the Colonial side of the German aims well to the front. The attempt to identify the proposed policj- of the League of Nations with British Imperialistic designs is somewhat clumsy, and will hardly avail to divert attention from Dr. Solf &apos;s own support of a limited form of internationalisation as a mearts of securing German &quot;economic penetration of Central Africa. The observations of Count Hertling about freedom of German economic development (see Appendix to Part II.) should be considered in this connection.G. G. A.March 7th, 1918.

PART   I. ^BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND  AFRICA.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Enemy Trading after the War. The attention of the Dominion Governments has been drawn to the question of the most-favoured-nation clauses in British commercial treaties being used, after the war, to secure advantages for our present enemies. Believing that precautions will be necessary in order to prevent these clauses being used by the enemy to advance their commercial interests, the British Government propose to issue a declaration to Allied and neutral countries, calling attention to the manner in which the enemy have pushed their .trade interests by utilising foreign organisations which, while claiming the benefit of the respective nationalities, have been in fact under enemy control. The proposed declaration would then proceed to emphasise the view that, commercial treaties are intended to benefit the bond fide trade interests of the parties concerned and not foreign interests, and that therefore the British authorities would feel obliged to take steps to ensure that any treaty with the country to whom the declaration is addressed should not be used indirectly to secure the commercial advantage of the enemy. After pointing out that during the period of reconstruction the British Government may not be able to extend the most-favoured-nation treatment to the enemy, the declaration would state that in the same way the provisions of any specific treaty with the country addressed could not be allowed to benefit persons who are now eiieny subjects, or undertakings&apos; controlled by such subjects. The Dominion Ministers are asked for their views upon the policj&apos; of the proposed declaration.Allied and Neutral Trading after the War.  The Dominion Governments have further been consulted as to the issue of a proposed despatch to Allied and neutral countries pointing out that though endeavour has been made to accord equal com-mercial treatment to all friendly nations during the war, the difficulties during the period of reconstruction would only permit the British authorities to extend to the Allies equal, though not identical, treatment between themselves, and to neutrals the nearest, approach to ecpaality and iclentitj&quot; which could be achieA-ed consistently with the financial and commercial interests of the Allied countries. The despatch would also remind the country addressed that the remedy for any dissatisfaction caused by the proposed action could be met by the denunciation of the treaty in question, but that this alternative would not be taken by Great Britain owing to a desire&apos;to preserve intact the commercial relations with all countries. The Dominion Ministers are asked if they see any objection to the course suggested above.CANADA.Meeting of New Parliament. The new Dominion Parliament will assemble on March 18th. It is intended to re-elect the Speaker (Mr. E. N. Rhodes) in the morning of that day, and the formal opening, with the Speech from the Throne, will take place in the afternoon.Union Government&apos;s Majority. The soldiers&apos; votes cast in England have now been counted, and, when added to the results previously announced, the Union Government are giA^en four more seats, two being from Prince Edward Island and two from Ontario. In the Yukon the issue is still undecided, but indications j)oint to the Government candidate being returned. As the Union candidate in the deferred election in Nelson (Man.) has been returned&apos;-by acclamation, the Government noAV possess a majority in the House of Commons of 70. In actual Azotes the GoA^ernment have polled throughout the Dominion a majority of 264,216 over all candidates opposed to them both the officially recognised Opposition nominees and others.
oThe position of the parties in the Provinces as the result of the elections is now -his  follows : -Government,       Opposition.Prince Edward Island - -         - 2 2Nova Scotia   -             - -           - &quot; &apos;           &quot; ^New Brunswick         .- -          -          -          &quot;2 r-oQuebec         -            - -            -       .    &quot; b^Ontario           -          - -         &quot;          &quot; il lManitoba j* .1Saskatchewan ------Id 0Alberta         -             - -            .- *British Columbia -          - 1 -.Totals - - - -   152 .       82If the soldiers&apos; vote alone is considered, the Government obtained a majority of 191,510 votes, or 93 &quot;62 per cent. The soldiers&apos; vote in Quebec Province increased the majorities of the three Union candidates who were elected in Montreal. In other constituencies of the Province the soldiers&apos; votes went overwhelmingly in favour of the Government, but were not sufficient to dispose of the adverse majorities provided by the civilians.It is possible to contrast the civil and military votes cast in the various Provinces by reference to the following table : 	Government.		Other Ca	ndidates- .	Civil and	Military only.	Civil and Military.	Military only.

As stated in the last Report, the result of the soldiers&apos; vote counted up to that time still left Mr. Sevigny (Minister of Inland Revenue) with a majority of 1,500 against him. It is now announced that he has resigned his position in the Dominion Cabinet. As Colonel Blondin (Postmaster-General) has also been defeated at the elections the Union Government will apparently be left without a French-Canadian representative in the Cabinet,The Dominion and the United States. The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) and the acting-Minister of Finance have returned to Ottawa from AVashington, where they have been in consultation with President Wilson and other representatives of the United States Government, with reference to the methods of co-operation for war purposes. Before leaving the United States, Sir Robert Borden expressed satisfaction with the work of the Mission in co-ordinating war effort. &quot; The spirit of Canada,&quot; he declared, &quot; seems to be the spirit of the United States.&quot;Besides the consideration of joint action between Canada and the United States in regard to industrial and financial matters, Lord Reading seized the opportunity afforded by the visit of Sir R. Borden to Washington to inform him, at the request of the British Government, as to the position of the question of Japanese intervention in Siberia. The concurrence of Sir Robert Borden was obtained in the proposed policy of the British Government in this matter.Direct telegraphic communication is now established between the Government War Boards at  Ottawa and AVashington.   In the first congratulatory message to
President Wilson Sir Robert Borden referred to the gratification of his Government at  the  close   and  cordial  relations   between  Canada  and  the   United  States &quot;strengthened,&quot; he added, &quot;as they have been by splendid comradeship in the supreme cause to which each country is consecrating its efforts.&quot;Women and the Government. The Conference between the representatives of women&apos;s interests and the Dominion Cabinet, to which attention was called in the last Report, met at Ottawa on February 28th. The leading women&apos;s organisations of every Province were represented in the delegation, which was officially welcomed by the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire. The Conference was addressed by the President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Rowell), who spoke on the general situation ; by the Minister of Militia (General Mewburn), who dealt with the urgent need for reinforcements ; by the Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Orerar), who advocated greater agricultural production ; by the Minister of Trade and Commerce (Sir George Foster), who dealt with thrift and economy ; and by the Labour Minister (Senator-Robertson), who described the forthcoming registration scheme for the Dominion.The women delegates presented to the Government at the Conference a Resolution asking that no further grain should be shipped to England until the British Govern-rnent prohibited the use of intoxicating liquor. The women congratulated the Government on their legislation relating to prohibition, and promised their hearty support in this connection.Mobilisation of War Resources. The Dominion War Cabinet have appointed a sub-Committee by Order-in-Council which will be charged with the duty of mobilising the resources of the nation for the prosecution of the war and will be known as the Canada Registration Board. The object of the Board-will be to provide the maximum amount of labour for the production of food, munitions and ships for the period of . the war, and they will enforce the registration of all male and female residents -of the Dominion over 16 years of age.Shipping on the Pacific. As to the requisitioning of the Empress steamers now on the Pacific service (vide Report No. 54), the Dominion Ministers do not wish to withdraw these steamers from the trade which, they point out, it has taken years to build up. It is suggested by the Canadian Government that, in view of the relations with Japan, two of the four steamers which are now being used for patrol service on the Pacific by the British Government, and which are of about the same capacity as the Empress&apos;ships, might be used for transport purposes. This, it is suggested, would obviate interference with the trade, which, if lost to Canada, would be difficult to recover from the Japanese.Owing to the importance of close co-operation between Canada and the United States with regard to chartering foreign shipping in the Pacific, the British Shipping-Controller has asked one of his representatives in the*United States to discuss the whole position with the Dominion Government at Ottawa.Construction of Slrips. The contracts for -ship construction in the Dominion which have been dealt with by the Imperial Munitions Board since March 1st, 1917, amount in value to $64,500,000, and these have constituted the largest programme of ship construction in the history of the country. The contracts have provided for the-building of 46 wooden ships, four of -which have been launched, and 43 steel ships, four of which have been completed. The total tonnage constructed in 1918 will, it is expected, amount to 400,000 tons, and directly the berths that, are now being utilised for the work of the Imperial Munitions Board are vacated they will be taken up by the Dominion Government.Civil Re-establishment of Soldiers. Further particulars are now available regarding the new&apos; Department of Soldiers&apos; Civil Re-establishment, to which attention was called in the last Report. This Department will deal with all men who are permanently incapacitated, and will also look after the interests of returned soldiers until they &quot;are placed in civil employment. The Department of Militia will be responsible for the hospital treatment of the soldiers, and for the care of those men whose incapacity is only temporary, until the time they receive their discharge. The Department wall work in close touch with the Provincial Governments and with other -Provincial and Municipal Organisations established to assist returned men.
The German Language in Ontario. A Bill has been introduced into the Ontario Legislature forbidding the use of the German language in schools, churches or public bodies in the Province under heavy penalties.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Recruiting Arrangements. Further information is now available regarding the arrangements announced by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) for recruiting in the commonwealth (vide Report No. 57). The tribunal which will determine the number of men necessary . to maintain the Australian Divisions at full strength, and consider the position regarding casualties, will consist of three Members, the High Court Judge being assisted by General Legge and the Commonwealth Statistician (Mr. Knibbs). By this means, it is believed by the Government that a termination will be given to the discussion as to what reinforcements are really-necessary.With regard to Mr. Hughes&apos; declaration that the Government would do all in their power to encourage eligible men in the public service to enlist, rules have been drawn up for employment in the Commonwealth departments which provide that for temporary appointments to the Civil Service returned soldiers are to replace eligibles, and for permanent Civil Service appointments the age limit is extended for qualifying by examination and successful soldier-candidates are to receive preference, physical defects not being a bar to employment.Organisation of Trade and. Industry. A conference of manufacturers, over which the Prime Minister presided, has considered the Government scheme for the organisa-tion of Trade and Industry and has arrived at the following decisions : (1) There will be an Association representing each industry, primary and secondarv, which will be composed of the producers and manufacturers.(2)- (a) A temporary general council for commerce and industry will be appointed consisting of 19 members: six representing primary industries, five the manufacturers, five commerce (including bankers and the shipping industry), while three will represent the interests of metals, coal and timber. The primary industries represented are to be wheat, cereals, graziers, dairying and allied industries, fruit, sugar and vine growers.(b) A temporary council will be appointed by the existing Associations in the respective groups. (3) (a) The Conference approves the appointment of one director, who will be nominated by the Government, (b) The scheme as far as possible shall be made self-supporting by levy or contribution.(1) A Science and Industry Institute on a permanent basis, and thoroughly equipped and staffed, will be an integral part of the m\ganisation, and will act in close touch with the Department of Commerce and Industry, and with the various industrial associations.(5) Trade representatives are to be appointed in the principal oversea markets.The only important departure made by the Conference from Mr. Hughes&apos; scheme was paragraph (3). The Conference made arrangements for the appointment of a temporary general council.Shipbuilding. The Prime Minister has announced that, subject to the arrangement of satisfactory conditions regarding the transfer of Walsh Island from the State to the Commonwealth, three ships will be Imilt at the clock on this island. The dock at Cockatoo Island is to be utilised for the &quot;building of war ships (vide Report No. 57). Ships are now being built in the States of Victoria and Tasmania, while the South Australian Government are making preparations for shipbuilding. Fourteen a-essels have been ordered for the Commonwealth in the United States.Woo/, for United States. The Commonwealth Government have telegraphed regarding wool for the United States (vide Report No. 57) that they realise military requirements must have priority, and. that they would be prepared to direct the Central Wool Committee to agree to the suggestion put forward for-the xitilisation of cross-bred wool. It is further pointed out that the matter of merino wool is of great importance to the Commonwealth, and that the recent safe of Australian wool of this character in Boston caused much unrest amongst the wool growers and buyers of the Commonwealth. Unless caution is exercised, the Australian Ministers are of opinion that discontent will arise similar to that which recently occurred in South Africa,5257-J&quot; 1     3
The Commonwealth Ministers express the hope that the wool will not he sold by auction, and they ash for full information as to how the United States will dispose of it, in order that they may consider and approve any course proposed.Imperial War Museum: National Attitude of the Commonwealth.- The Prime Minister has informed the British Government that the Commonwealth Government cannot agree to the suggestion that the Imperial War Museum should have the first choice of all the Avar trophies captured by Australian troops. The view taken is that the sacrifices made by the Australian soldiers entitle them to the possession of such relics in their own country where their own kindred can see the results of their valour. It is further pointed out that Great Britain has a history and traditions and relics which extend back for centuries, and the present war only adds to the long record. On the other hand, Australia has no such history or traditions, except in so far as she draws them from the Mother Country. A nation, the Prime Minister remarks, is built up on pride of race, and now that Australia is making historv of her own she requires ever)&apos; possible relic associated with this to educate her children in the national spirit, which will ensure loyal adherence to and defence of the Empire of which she forms part. No objection, however, is raised to Australian exhibits being included in the Museum, provided Australia has the first choice with regard to them.State Coal Mines. -The New South Wales Government have cancelled the proclamation under which they acquired all coal mines in the State on account of the recent strikes.Policy of South Australia. The Premier of South Australia (Mr. Peake) has announced that the policy of the Government will be directed towards the stimulation of greater production and the reduction of the cost of living. He announces that the Government intends to develop agricultural research, establish liberal land laws, and give increased assistance to settlers. The Government, he declares, are in favour of continuing the existence of the Upper House and of giving the vote to all soldiers, sailors and nurses over the age of 21. He states that the Government are not in favour of total liquor prohibition.Queensland Elections: Government Attitude. Idle Premier of Queensland (Mr. Ryan), in anticipation of the elections of March 16th, has issued an address to soldiers in which he declares that the elections will determine whether the Labour Government shall retain power, or whether the affairs of Queensland shall be handed over to the Liberal-Tory Party. The Premier claims that the Government has been developing the resources of the country, maintaining good wages and keeping a check upon prices. He quotes the organ of the Returned Soldiers&apos; Association as saying &quot; The Queensland Government has done more and still is doing more for returned soldiers than any other Government in Australia,&quot; and he declares : &quot; We &quot; know that you want to come back to a free country, and one not in the grip of the &quot; profiteer and Trust. On behalf of the Labour Government, I say that we will not &quot; falter in our duty. From you all we expect support, for your support will help in &quot; building a bigger and better Empire, an Empire where each child shall possess the &quot; inherent right to be properly nourished, clothed, educated and fitted for the battle &quot; of life, and each man the inalienable right to a fair wage and decent living &quot; conditions.&quot;The National Party in Queensland. -The acting-Leader of the Opposition and of the National Party in the Queensland State Parliament has stated that his Party propose to make the Upper House elective, and to submit to a Referendum the question of reducing the number of Members in the Lower House.NEW  ZEALAND.Japanese in Samoa, The Governor-General of the Dominion has informed the British Government that four Japanese subjects who recently arrived in Samoa applied for permission to remain there, and this request was refused by the Adminis-trator, who, however, telegraphed to the Governor-General for instructions as to future action. The Dominion GoArernment, after careful consideration, have advised the Governor-General that it is inadvisable to permit Japanese subjects to settle in Samoa and the views of the British Government on the subject have therefore been sought.
Dominion Red Cross. Colonel 11. lieaton Rhodes (ex-Postmaster-General of the Dominion) has arrived in.London on a mission of enquiry into the organisation and administration of the New Zealand Red Cross branch in England, and as to the advisability of appointing a Dominion Red Cross Commissioner for France, and also for Egypt. Colonel Rhodes is further engaged in investigating the methods now adopted in England for the training and instruction of crippled and maimed soldiers.SOUTH AFRICA.General Smuts and Leave of Absence. The Union House of Assembly discussed last week a motion to grant leave of absence to General Smuts from his duties as Minister of Defence. The motion met with the strong opposition of the Nationalists, who voted against it, but it was ultimately carried by 78 votes to 22. In the course of the debate, Mr. Charles Fichardt said that the Nationalists were not concerned in what General Smuts was doing for the British Empire and that he feared by paying his salary the Union was subscribing to General Smuts&apos; policj-. The Leader of the Labour Party (Colonel Creswell) expressed the view that the matter was one for General Smuts&apos; constituents, but that he hoped Gmieral Smuts&apos; extended stay in England would give him a greater insight into the Labour point of view. Sir Percy Fitzpatrick. (Unionist) described General Smuts as one of South Africans greatest ornaments.In replying on the debate, the Prime Minister (General Botha) stated that in dark days General Smuts had been a true comrade to himself and thousands of South Africans, and that he was not surprised that the world was proud of him. He explained that General Smuts was in England in his stead, and reminded the House that the day might come at any time when peace proposals woidd again be mooted. General Smuts would then naturally look after South Africans interests. General Botha proceeded to discuss a certain number of incidents for which General Smuts had been blamed as a member of the War Cabinet by the Nationalists, such as matters connected with the sale of the wool clip and the refusal of South. African coal to Dutch ships, declaring that as an integral part of the British Empire, they had to do things which in ordinary circumstances might not have been dreamt of, and to take any other course would have been treason and dishonestv. He challenged the Nationalists to say that they were not part of the British Empire. They must either do their duty or establish a Republic. He intended to stand by the Empire because he realised that South Africa&apos;s future and prosperity depended on doing so.Importation of Native^Labour. In the House of Assembly on February 28th a debate took place on a motion by the Leader of the Labour Party (Colonel Creswell), condemning the resumption of the importation of native labourers from north of 22 degrees south latitude. Colonel Creswell declared that the arguments which applied to the Chinese applied equally to natives in the tropical regions, and he had fears concerning the effect such importation might have on the labour situation after the Avar.The Prime Minister said the free recruiting of natives in the tropical regions was &apos; not contemplated by the Government. He gave figures showing the splendid results which had been obtained by Dr. Listers prophylactic measures, stating, that the experiments had been- limited to 1,000 natives. (These figures showed that as a result of inoculating natives with pneumococcal vaccine in the Premier Diamond Mine, the mortality from pneumonia fell from 18&apos;80 per thousand to 0&apos;86, in the Crown mines from 7&apos;02 to 2&apos;95, and in the De Beers mines from 14-22 to 3&apos;98.) Upon the final result would depend whether Parliament would be asked to sanction the withdrawal Of the restriction on the importation of native labour from the tropical regions.Mr. J. X. Merriman and Mr, Patrick. Duncan (Unionist) protested against the experiment as involving a grave danger to white civilisation.The debate was afterwards adjourned, General Botha promising to consult the House before natives from tropical regions were allowed to enter the Union.Price of Wheat and Cost of Living. The Report of the Commission on the cost of living has been presented to the Union Parliament, in the course of which the recommendation is made that the price of wheat should be fixed at 16s. per 100 lbs. The Labour Minority Report of the Commission, however, recommended 13s. It was announced on behalf of the Government that while am- attempts to corner, wheat would, be prevented, the price would not be fixed, as the prospects of importation hack improved, and large cargoes had recently arrived from Australia.
sDiscovery of. Iron Ore. The  Union Government  have informed the British authorities that very high grade iron ore has been discovered in the Ermelo District and the deposit is believed to be of. vast extent.   The Union Ministers therefore&apos; enquire whether a regular supply of such ore for munition purposes would be welcomed and, if so, whether the necessary shipping would be available.GERMAN AFRICA.lh\ Solf on German Colonial Policy. The German Colonial Secretary (Dr. Soil) has attempted to reply in the Reichstag to the recent lecture by General Smuts (vide Appendix to Report No. 53) which dealt with German aims in Africa, and according to German Wireless Dr. Solf treated General Smuts&apos; attitude as &quot;an official English pronouncement.&quot; As to the return of the German Colonies, Dr. Solf declared in his speech : &quot; On the German side, there has never been am- doubt that the German Government and the German people also were.unanimous in cpenly taking- &quot; the standpoint that we wanted our colonies back again, but. just as Lloyd George is desirous of destroying her as an industrial Power, so General Smuts is desirous &quot; of destroying Germany as a Colonial Power. He gives as the reason for this the &quot; safety of the British Empire, which precludes, their return. The French also have &quot; made a French Monroe Doctrine as regards Western Africa to the exclusion of the &quot; German Colonies.   General Smuts is striving for the old idea of direct communi--&quot; cation from the Cape to Cairo and he connects therewith, further, thoughts of a way &apos;&apos; through Egypt to Calcutta, by means of the incorporation of Arabia, Mesopotamia &quot; and Syria into the British Empire. This is not the spirit which can assure a &quot; real peace.&quot;As to the question of the militarisation of the natives, Dr. Solf denied that Germany was using her Colonies for the formation and training of detachments of coloured troops. - Before the war, he said, Germany had, in a Colonial Empire of 12 million natives, only 3,600 of them under arms as guard troops, to which should be added about the same number of coloured police. On the other hand, France, in her African possessions, had created a standing army of 100,000 men, and England had large numbers of native troops everywhere. It was not Germany, but the Entente, which took the war to Africa.Dr. Soil: then endeavoured to identify the idea of the League of Nations with Imperialistic schemes of-British expansion, stating that General Smuts used the idea of a Peace League only as a fighting means in favour of an English Imperialism at the expeuse of the vital interests of other peoples. He asserted that behind General Smuts there stood the British Government, the great masses and great interests.THE PACIFIC.1A uslralia and the German Solomon Islands. An interesting report appears in the Anza.c Bidletin regarding the Australian control of the German Solomon Islands. In introducing the subject the writer observes : &quot; The diplomacy which gave Bourgain-&quot; ville, Buka, and the numerous small islands, which make up the German Solomons, &quot; to Germany was a distinct discredit to British statesmanship.&quot;With regard to the administration of the islands, the writer observes that the district officer (Captain A. J. Hunter) has during his term of administration, kept the German planters, traders and recruiters busy at their occupations and has tactfully prevented them from making mischief. He has also explored the Island of Bourgain-ville, and, it is stated, &quot;in these exploratoiy trips, with a handful of men, he has &quot; completely subdued the tribal warfare which for years, especially under the German &quot; rule, has been decimating the native tribes.&quot; It is also stated that &quot; Customs, Post &quot; Office, Law Courts (German laws), Native Affairs, and all other administrative &quot;departments have been set up in these German Solomons and with distinct success. &quot; Every institution is manned by Australians.&quot;In summing up the Australian administration of the Islands, the writer observes that practically every obstacle which can retard the progress of the German Solomon Islands has been removed, and, he adds, &quot; should they come under Australian administration eventually, the way will be open for an era of wonderful progress.&quot;1 See also tjnder &quot; New Zealand.&quot;
