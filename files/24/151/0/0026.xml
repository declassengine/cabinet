SECRET.ATJMi 1.-X.TATI0N OF THE ATT AO TIED WESTERN AND G EXERALREPORT No. 75.PART I.  BRITISH EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.The 51st anniversary of the birth of the Dominion called from the Dominion Prime Minister an inspiring message to the Canadian troops, which expressed the national spirit of Canada in the world-crisis.Points of special interest in this Report relate to the satisfactory Bank statement by the Ministry of Finance, the Declaration of the Labour Minister on the rights of Labour, the Nova Scotia strikers&apos; recognition of the Allied need for steel, progress of the National Registration scheme and methods of its enforcement, and the question of calling up men of 19 for Military Service.Australian Coalyj on wealth\The statement of Mr. Hughes about the effort of Australia in the war places the Commonwealth high in the record of the national achievements of the Dominions.Mr. Watts&apos; reported observations about dm Australian defensive alliance for the Pacific are of interest. As far as can be judged from an abbreviated Press notice, they seem to be on the lines of the recent Inter-State Commissions Report (vide Report No. 66).The scheme of establishing a Federal Arsenal on a large scale is in accordance with the doctrine of developing local sottrces of supply to the utmost extent possible.South Africa.The news from South Africa about the Nationalist conspiracy to raise an armed revolt was at first rather disquieting.- The action taken by the Government some time ago to prevent the supply of arms, and the prompt measures decided upon to meet the present situation, seem likely to tide over the difficulties ; recent events show the truth of General Botha&apos;s warning about General Hertzog&apos;s dangerous utterances. Though the Nationalist Leader is now taking a conciliatory and peaceful line, it is to be feared that his previous &quot;playing with fire.&quot; has taken many of his followers beyond his control.The recent threatening attitude of the mine natives seems to have been due to Nationalist influence. Tbe madness of such a policy will enlist little sympathy from white South Africans of any race.   Practically all natives have now returned to work.[p:.t o.
The statement of the President of the Chamber of Mines about tbe nold-miuinff position should be noted.Tbe somewhat remarkable article upon South Africa appearing iu the Frank-furler Zeitung is of considerable interest.Foreign Colonies.The German views on British Colonial Policy which are given in thea- Report should be read carefully, as they indicate the kind of doctrine which is sedulously spread in the Fatherland about British aims and methods.G.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Dominion Day. The fifty-first anniversary of the birth of the Dominion was celebrated throughout Canada quietly, although the day was regarded generally as a holiday. Special services were held in nearly every church on the eve of Dominion Day, in accordance with the wish of the Government that Sunday should be treated as a day of national humiliation and prayer for the success of the Allied arms.In the course of a Dominion Day message to Canadian soldiers serving oversea, the Prime Minister of the Dominion (Sir Robert Borden) gave expression to the following words : &quot;Another anniversary of the Canadian Confederation has come to us in solemn clays ; but it finds our Dominion still strong and resolute in its purpose, standing side by side with the other nations of the Empire in the world welter of this supreme struggle.&quot;Progress of Registration: some disorder in Quebec Province. Although June 22nd was officially designated Registration Day, persons of both sexes over the age of 16 who failed or were unable to till in cards and receive registration certificates on that day, have been given a further chance to comply with the law.Until July 22nd, those who are still unregistered may report at any post office throughout the country where registration facilities are available. In the meantime, persons who are not in possession of certificates cannot get meals at public eating places, secure hotel accommodation, or buy railway tickets, because restaurant, keepers, hotel clerks, and railway officials are demanding evidence of registration before any service is given. This is done in accordance with instructions issued by the Canada Registration Board, and these steps are proving highly effective, as hundreds of delinquents, male and female, are registering at post offices.Senator Gideon Robertson, head of the Registration Board, states that the reports which have already been received, indicate that the returns of people who have registered are very large indeed.Evidence of a number of serious disorders following the registration efforts in several rural districts of Quebec Province have reached Quebec City. The disturbances, however, were confined to Montmagny and Beauce Counties, where the registrars&apos; offices were looted and the cards destroyed:It was reported that the disorders were due to gangs of young men who allowed their prejudices to run away with their judgment.Registrar Langlois expresses satisfaction at the returns coming to hand from the Quebec District, and states that the farming classes generally responded well to the call to register. The registration as a whole was effected tranquilly and without incident, save in the outside places where disorder occurred. According to&apos; the officials, the results secured in Quebec City compare favourably with those of any part of Canada.Position of Men of Nineteen. The Government have issued a statement regarding the status of men of the nineteen-year-old class under the Military Service Act, in order to correct an erroneous impression which is held in some quarters.The statement declares that the belief that men of this class who are called upon to register will be immediately called to the Colours is quite incorrect. No date has yet been fixed for calling up the men, nor has the question been brought before the Cabinet for decision.In view of the need of labour on farms, it is thought unlikely that the Cabinet-will give consideration to the calling out of this class until the harvest is over, although, of course, their action must be determined primarily by the military situation.
Farmers and Conscription. According to Mr. T. M. Tweedie, M.P., for Calgary West, the attitude of the fanners at the recent Convention in Ontario does not represent the measure of patriotism of all the agriculturists of that Province.In an interview, Mr. Tweedie stated that a number of Ontario members of Parliament had received telegrams from their constituents saying that they did not wish to be classed with the farmers who were opposing the conscription of farm hands for the Army.One member Of the House, who received a petition from a section of his con-stituency asking him to resign as a protest against the action of the Government, told Mr. Tweedie that out of 47 names attached to the petition he recognised 43 as those of men who opposed him at the last election.Allies&apos; need of Steel recognised by Strikers. The dispute between the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company and their employees at the Sydney mines has been settled, according to an announcement by the President of the Canadian Trades and Labour Council (Mr. J. 0. Watters) who has been acting on behalf of the Dominion Govern-ment in the matter.The Company agreed to grant an increase in wages, and the settlement was arrived at-after a three-hour conference.The report of the men&apos;s committee was adopted at a mass meeting of the employees held in the evening. While some dissatisfaction was expressed as to the extent of the increases granted, the majority of the speakers urged acceptance, on account of the urgent need of the Allies of steel production for war purposes.According to a statement issued after the meeting, the men stated that they were &quot; ready to make every effort humanly possible to supply the steel needed to help win the war.&quot;Labour Minister on the Eights of Labour. The Minister of Labour (Mr. T. W. Crothers), has-issued the following- statement: &quot;Perhaps in larger numbers than ever before complaints are reaching the Minister of Labour from working men that their employers forbid them, under penalty of dismissal, to become members of any labour organisation. Upon investigation of such complaints, they have generally been well-founded.&quot; The Minister of Labour deeply regrets this attitude of the employers, and believing too well that it is calculated to produce serious labour disturbances, he maintains that every man must be at perfect liberty to associate himself with his fellow-workers in any legitimate labour organisation, without thereby subjecting himself to penalties or discriminations of any character.&quot;Deposits in Banks. The Bank statement for the month of May, which has just been issued hy the Finance Department, shows that a satisfactory response has been made to the appeals of the Finance Minister and other Dominion public men. The total deposits in the Canadian Banks at the end of May were 11,687,586,353, or an excess of fi 144,500,000 over those of the same date last year. Deposits in the savings banks contributed over $55,000,000 to the increase.AUSTRALIAN   COMMONWEALTH.Commomeealth. Effort in the War. The Prime&quot; Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Hughes) gave some figures relating to Australia s effort in the war at a recent gathering in London, when he pointed out that Australia had enlisted 426,000 soldiers of whom nearby d20,000 had been transported 14,000 miles. Australia, he said, had alone organised, and had paid for the equipment, the transport, and the maintenance of this great army. For the past two years she had maintained five divisions in France, the equivalent of one cavalry division in Egypt and Palestine, and had kept up all cadres to strength hy voluntary enlistment. The personnel of the Royal Australian-Navy (Mr. Hughes continued) exceeded; 9,000 officers and men, and Australia bore the whole cost of the Australian Navy, which during the war had been placed entirely under Imperial control. Although the Australian population was barely 5,000,000, considerably over 8 per cent, had enlisted, while 48,842 had been killed in action, 133,000 had been wounded, and only 3,274 had surrendered to the enemy, principally owing to  stress of wounds.    The total war expenditure of Australia exceeded6073-la A 2
220,000,000L sterling up to the end of J une. The cost to the end of the present financial year would he about 100,000,000Z. Mr. Hughes added that Australia would hear the cost of repatriating all her troops and re-establishing them in civil life at an estimated cost of thirty millions.Defensive Alliance for the Pacific. The acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) is reported in a Press cable to have declared that a defensive alliance between Australia, New Zealand and some of the Pacific Islands will probably come into being after the war.   (Vide also Report No. 66.)Labour and Recruiting. In pursuance of the undertaking given by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) to Labour representatives at the Governor-Generahs Recruiting Conference, the Federal Executive have repealed regulations relating to the Military Service Referendum.federal Arsenal Scheme. Shortly before the rising of Parliament, the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) outlined the Federal Arsenal scheme in the Senate, and stated that the scheme included the manufacture of all classes of munitions and aeroplanes. It was intended, the Minister announced, to begin work immediately. Mr. J. K. Jenson, of the Federal Public Service, has been appointed Secretary of the Australian Arsenal.Trade with Japan. The Sydney office of the Japanese Shipping Company has announced that the Company are building 30 new steamers, aggregating 300,000 tons dead weight, for the Australian trade.It is stated in banking circles in the Commonwealth that a second Japanese bank will open shortly in Australia.Fixing of Meat Prices. A deputation consisting of nearly 3,000 primary producers from all parts of Victoria recently waited on the Acting Prime Minister in order to protest against the fixing of meat prices. Mr. Watt replying, said that the Ministry had shown the tenderest consideration for the wishes of the producers of Australia, and instanced the sales of wheat, -wool and other products. Speaking personally he said that price-fixing in normal times was futile, but was necessary in war time. Continuing, he said he saw no reason why producers should not be compelled to sell to the Australian people at the same relative price at which they had voluntarily sold to the British people. No argument had been produced to justify him in believing that the price of meat shoxdd not or could not be fixed.SOUTH AFRICA,Nationalist Conspiracy to raise Armed Revolt. Reports have recently reached the Union Government which indicated a Nationalist conspiracy to raise an armed revolt. The headcptarters of the organisation are apparently situated on the East Rand, but other districts of the Transvaal are said to be involved. The movement is believed to have sprung from the Nationalist attempt to raise commandos, which followed the riot in Johannesburg last April. There is no evidence of complicity of any but a few individuals in any other Province, or of airy disloyalty among the troops in the Cape Province or elsewhere. It is believed that no leader of any standing is involved, though General Hertzog, who has spoken strongly against rebellion (see next paragraph) is said to have lost control over a section of his party. As the information which the Government received led them to think that a rising had been planned for last weekend, they took prompt measures to deal with the situation, and in consequence it appears probable that tbe conspirators have abandoned their intention of raising a revolt.General IIertzog&apos;s Warning &apos;against Violence. Speaking at Carolina, General Hertzog is reported in a Reuter message of June 25th to have reiterated his warning against violence, declaring that all the Nationalists were seeking for could, and would, be achieved by constitutional means alone.South Africa, he said, had had quite enough of armed protests and unarmed rebellions. Nothing was to be feared from the Free State. He hoped that the Transvaal was imbued with the same spirit.
Strike of Mine Natives.-There was some fear on the Band of a general strike of mine natives on July 1st, when about 5,000 natives declined to work. General Botha had sent a special message to all mines on June 29th urging the natives to remain quiet. The difficulties were confined to a small area. Though the declared object of the natives was to obtain higher wages, there is little doubt that the movement is due to Nationalist and International Socialist agitators. On July 2nd it was reported that practically all the natives had returned to work, and that all was quiet on other mines-.Position of Cold Mines. The President of the Chamber of Mines (Mr. Wallers) made an important reference to the industrial situation about a week ago. He said he regretted the position regarding the low grade mines had not improved ; indeed the reverse was the case owing to the native labour position not showing improvement, and the persistent iucrease of working costs apart from employees&apos; requests for increased wages or a war bonus. Mr. Wallers added that he felt that with all the facts on the table, and nothing withheld, they had every hope of thoroughly realising one anotheFs difficulties, and coming to a satisfactory -agreement. The granting to the mine employees of wages equivalent to the increase recently granted by the municipality would, he remarked, result in the gold mining industry ceasing to exist on the present scale, and the destruction of the prosperity of the whole community. Nevertheless the requests would receive the earnest consideration of the ChambePs Executive, and he was sure its feeling of responsibility was shared by the unions concerned and by the commercial community.Germany and South Africa. The Frankfurter Zeitung, in a remarkable article, utters a warning against the exaggerated-view taken in Germany as to the Separatist tendencies of some British dominions, especially South Africa, and says that the political development of South Africa still finds little understanding in Germany, where the public like articles by pro-German Boers which appear now and then in the Dutch Press. It is perfectly true, the writer declares, that the crisis through which the British Empire is passing in consequence of the war has supplied plentiful ammunition to the anti-British Hertzoglte opposition. On the other hand, he admits that the war has greatly strengthened the bonds uniting the -Dominion to the Motherland.After explaining that during the last years prior to the war the South African Union underwent a remarkable agricultural and industrial expansion, which gave rise to an ambition that the country should become a second Canada, the writer observes : &quot; The South African Union has developed a patriotism of its own, different alike from the Jingo spirit of the successors of Jameson and from the narrow-minded patriotism of the grandchildren of Krnger. Whoever has travelled in the country from the Cape to the Zambesi knows there is to-day a South African nation in being, comprising Boers, English and Germans alike.&quot; It is for the future of this new nation, the writer declares, that Generals Botha and Smuts are lighting, and not, as the Germans represent, for British rule.INDIA.(Excluding external affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Constitutional Reform. The Report by the Secretary of State for India and the Viceroy upon Indian Constitutional Reform will be published on Friday evening next July 5th. A summary of the recommendations will be given in next week&apos;s Western and General Report.FOREIGN  COLONIES.German views on British Colonial Policy. Regarding German and British Colonial policy, the Director of the News Department of the Foreign Office, Herr Deutelmoser, at a meeting of well-known political personages on June 21st, said (according to German Avireless, June 23rd) : &quot;Nothing can be more significant than the circumstance that England, in spite of its great embarrassment in the European theatres of war, regarded it as necessary to undertake, with the use of great military forces, a war of conquest against German
Colonies. Tlie manifold and expressive voices at the Imperial Conference now sitting in London make it clear that the desire exists to retain in British possession the overseas settlements of Germany. Thus it is sought to create an Australian Monroe doctrine for the South Seas, and to apply this doctrine similarly in South Africa. The reproach continuously circulated by the Entente that Germany with her Colonial policy was pursuing military aims has been disproved many times by the Imperial Office with convincing proofs that German Colonial policy was inspired *by nothing but economic objects, and that such objects were in harmony with, the vital needs of all other peoples. A glance at the map shows with perfect clearness that it is England which possesses a large number of overseas settlements which are economi-cally without special significance, and whose acquisition and maintenance can only be regarded as of military significance. The English battle against Germany is in reality directed against German industry and German efficiency, which had developed from former poverty and political insignificance to world-wide importance. The deepest reason for English enmity against the German Empire is to be sought in the circumstance that the qualities of the German people compelled England in an increasing measure herself to work instead of profiting by the fruits of foreign labour.&quot; In a recent exposition Dr. Ziiitgraff, the w^ell-known colonial politician, explained how he set out with youthful faith in the purity of the ideals of the great British Empire, but has been taught by experiemce to take a contrary view. 1 ie described English activities in Zanzibar, Abyssinia and Arabia, and proved (the message states) by means of examples that the most paltry means were employed not only for the exploitation of native States, but with a view ultimately to the safety of India. The Cape to Cairo and the Cape to Calcutta policy, which represented two of the leading objects in the world-power policy of the last decade, caused England to desire, contrary to Germany, a weak and dilapidated Abyssinia and a weak and dilapidated Turkey. In this connection he declared that the notorious campaign of English public opinion against the Belgian administration of the Congo aimed at removing Belgium from that territory. He pointed out that England, if she really desired to remove the evil conditions which existed in the African colonies, would have taken action against such conditions in the Portuguese colonies, where they were well known to prevail. But here she was deliberately silent, for the slave trade which had developed in Mozambique helped in&quot; the working of the mines in South Africa, and thus was to the advantage of England.&quot;
