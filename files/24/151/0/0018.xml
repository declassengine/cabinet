Borden and Air. iVJeighen) and two Liberal-Unionists (Mr. Rowell and Mr. Calder).The subjects suggested by tbe Dominion Government for discussion at the Imperial War Conference are indicated. Joint consideration has already been given to some of them in the past.Further information is given in this Report about the items of taxation involved in the Budget. This is one of the most important, of the financial programmes presented to Parliament since Confederation.The statements of the Prime Minister and Mr. Rowell on the exemption of young farmers show clearly that the Government regard the provision of reinforcements as of even greater importance than increased food production.Australian Commonwealth.The criticism of the Leader of the Commonwealth Opposition&apos;on the capacity of Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cook to interpret Australian public opinion is discounted by the reports of the firm attitude adopted by Labour Leaders towards peace, proposals.The pronouncement of the Acting Prime Minister upon Australians interest in the peace settlement is important, especially the reference to the possibility of Allied Powers holding the Pacific Islands.The arrangements for repatriation are worthy of careful attention.South Africa.The Press report of General Botha&apos;s statement about representation of South Africa at the Peace Conference is important. [r.T,o.
The abandonment by General Hertzog of active Republican propaganda during the war shows that he realises that, the Nationalists have recently gone too far.

PART   I.   BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND  AFRICA.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Arrival of Dominion Ministers. The Secretary of. State for the Colonies has informed the War Cabinet that arrangements have been made for the conveyance of the Dominion Ministers across the Atlantic in time for them to take part in the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet and Conference at the end of the first week in June.SELF-GOVERNING DOMINIONS,CANADA.Imperial War Cabinet. The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) will be aeconl-panied to England by the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Meighen), the Minister of Immigration and Colonisation (Mr. Calder), and the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Rowel!).. Imperial War Conference. The Dominion Government have telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, suggesting for discussion at the meetings of the Imperial War Conference, the following subjects, viz., the immediate establish-ment of a central authority to control matters relating to the emigration of ex-service men and the adoption of a plan to provide funds for the purpose of establishing British ex-soldiers in.the over-sea Dominions ; further consideration of demobilisation problems ; transportation and communication within the Empire (with special reference to ocean carriage, cable facilities and the State control of rates) ; establisfi-ment of an Imperial News Service and State aid in connection therewith ; and financial provision after the war for the development of Imperial resources.War Loans and Taxation. The Acting Minister of Finance (Mr. A. Iv. MacLean) stated, in the course of his presentation of the Dominion Budget proposals to the House of Commons (vide Report No. 66), that the amount subscribed to Canadian War Loans since December 1st, 1915, totalled 746 million dollars, of which he said that Canadians had contributed 700 million. Subscriptions to the Victory War Loan equalled 50 dollars per head of the population.The new taxation proposals of the Government involve a duty of f 0 cents per pound on tea and additional duties upon coffee, cigars, tobacco and beverages (in the manufacture of which malt, rice, or corn is used). the war Profits tax is re-enacted and its operation extended to include firms having a capital of 25,000 dollars and upwards, who will pay 25 per cent, on profits in excess of 10 per cent, of their capitalisation. As to the taxation of incomes, in the case of unmarried persons, exempted incomes are lowered from 1,500 dollars to 1,000 dollars, and in the case of married people from 3,000 dollars to 2,000 dollars. The rate of taxation is now 2 pet-cent, on incomes of unmarried persons with between 1,000 dollars and 1,500 dollars, and married people with between 1,500 dollars and 3,000 dollars. Above those figures the rate is 4 per cent. There is a remission of 200 dollars for each child under 16 years of age. The supertax on incomes runs from 2 per cent, when the income exceeds 6,000 dollars to 50 per cent, when it exceeds 1,000,000 dollars ; the figures are the same as in the old Act in the case of incomes of less than 50,000 dollars, but they are higher above that amount. The surtax on incomes begins at 5 per cent, of the tax payable on incomes from 6,000 dollars to 10,000 dollars, and runs as high as 35 per cent, of the tax payable on incomes over 200XX30 dollars. This is a new feature.
&apos; Canadian Northern Railway. The Acting Minister of Finance moved a -Resolution in Parliament last week, giving the Gpvermnent power to renew the loans to the Canadian Northern System, and explained that these renewals woidd not increase the Dominions obligations, while the step was desirable in the national interest. The loans which mature this year amount to over 26 million dollars, with about 13 million additional up to August 1918. Mr. Lemieux was amongst those expressing criticism of the Canadian Northern methods of finance, but the Government Resolution was adopted.Parliamentary Session. The Prime Minister anuonnced last week when moving a Resolution to provide for morning&apos; sittings of the House of Commons, that it was desirable that Ministers should be relieved from Parliamentary duties at an early date. There were, he said, two alternatives, one being to work a little harder and get through the session in 10 days, and the other, to adjourn Parliament and meet in the summer.Proposed Exemption.of Fanners.- The Prime Minister and representatives of the -Cabinet were waited&apos; upon on May 4th -by a large deputation of Ontario farmers who submitted the desirability of relaxing the new military order cancelling all exemptions of men between the ages of 20 and 22. The Prime Minister announced that, after fully considering the question, the Cabinet had decided that the necessity for reinforce-ments was more pressing than the need for increased food production. &quot;He said that the Government appreciated the difficulties which the farmers were experiencing, but reminded them that the hardships suffered by them and the people of Canada were not to be compared with those endured by the people of Great Britain, France and other countries in the theatre of war. The Minister of Militia (Major-General Mewburn) stated that, in order to solve the problem of seeding, instructions had been issued to the Commandants of the War Military Districts to grant leave of absence to all young farmers.The President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Rowell) had previously declared to a meeting of farmers that the Government would go ahead with the man-power proposals no matter what opposition might develop. He stated emphatically that, important as food-production was, it Avas not so important as man-power.Air Service. The Minister of Militia, in announcing the details as to men reporting under the Military Service Act up to April 29th, said that 2,062 had joined the Royal Air Force.Mr. Rodolphe Lemieux read a telegram from Quebec in the House of Commons last week, stating that applications were pouring in for enlistment in the Royal Air Force. The Prime Minister, in reply to a question in the House, -stated that it was quite possible that a Canadian Flying Corps might be formed, but he was not able to make a statement at the present time.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Imperial War Cabinet Delegates : Labour Attitude. Before the Prime Minister mid Mr. Cook left Australia for the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) moved a Resolution in the House of Representatives that Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cook could not represent Australian public opinion in London, on three grounds : Firstly, on account of Mr. Hughes&apos; speeches at the Paris Conference ; secondly, because of his Avar policy ;&apos; and thirdly, by reason of his conduct of public affairs. In reply, the Prime Minister made an earnest appeal to opponents to forget their differences and to unite Avith the Government in order to obtain the necessary reinforcements. He assured Labour that the Government would carry out the promises made at the Recruiting Conference, irrespective of whether Labour did their part.Labour Views on Peace. A feature of the Flinders bye-eleetion (rendered necessary by the appointment of Sir W. Irvine to the Judicial Bench) is the Labour manifesto in favour of peace by negotiation. This manifesto has been denounced by the Leader of the Labour Opposition in the CommonAArealth Senate (Senator Gardiner). Avho said that he emphatically wished to repudiate that the Labour Party stood for
peace or the cessation of hostilities. The Australian Labour Party, he said, was hi the fight to a finish, aiid while he anticipated that the policy foreshadowed in connection with the Flinders bye-election would be proposed at the coming Federal Labour Conference, he was sure the Australian working classes would repudiate it. He further stated that the manifesto was the production of one man. (The author of the manifesto is the Secretary of the Victorian Labour Party.)The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) declared that Senator Gardiner had taken a position which commended itself to every true Australian. He referred to-the fact that the American Labour Parties were behind their Government, and said that surely both parties could find common ground in Australia.The Leader of the Opposition in the New South Wales State Parliament (Mr. Storey) has made it clear that he disagrees with the Victorian Labour Party&apos;s war manifesto, and has stated that he fails to see any evidence that Germany is willing to negotiate. He has declared that he is sure the manifesto does not represent the great body of workers in Australia.Acting Prime -Minister on Australasia- and the Pacific. In an important speech delivered in the course of the Flinders bye-election campaign, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) dealt with Australasian interests and ambitions in the Peace Settlement. After stating that the Nationalist Party stood for fighting on until an honourable peace and security had been achieved, the Acting Prime Minister declared that Australia and New Zealand sought for nothing but to lie the white outpost of the British Empire in the southern hemisphere, and to hold their land for decent white people. The only way Australia could safe-guard herself was by destroying the chance of enemy nations getting bases near the Australian coast. The man who said to Germany, &quot; Take back what we have won from you in the Pacific,&quot; was offering the enemy a breeding ground within naval striking distance of Australia. In Great Britain or the Allied Powers holding the Pacific Islands, Mr. Watt declared, rested Australians fate for future generations.Home Defence scheme.e.-The Home Defence Scheme has been started and State Commandants have been instructed to notify areas for officers and secure the names of volunteers. The intention is to place all militia units on a war footing, properly officered, trained and ecpbpped.Repatriation Arrangements.-The Minister&apos; for Defence, in moving the Second Reading of the Defence Bill in the Senate, said that after the Avar it was not intended to discharge the men automatically, but that II days after their return they would lie kept organised until the Repatriation Department could arrange to place them in civil life. Those with prospects of employment could be discharged at the discretion of the Minister.The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Milieu) in moving the Second Reading of the Repatriation Amendment Bill, said that to the end of last year help had been given to 26,500 men, about 100,000?. had been, distributed from patriotic funds and 32S,000Z. from the Repatriation Committee. The Repatriation scheme aimed at returning strong men to their former vocations, and at arranging for the treatment of the incapacitated under five headings in the following manner : First, slightly incapacitated, for whom provision would be made in ordinary industrial establishments. &apos; These would be selected by the Industrial Committee upon which the Industrial Organisations and employers would be ecpially represented. The value of their work would be assessed by the Committee, any*^hflerehce between the assessed value and the minimum wage would be made up by the Department.Second, the more seriously incapacitated, would be men who could not immediately be placed in factories or workshops. These would be given a course of special technical classes formed by agreement with the States, under wdiich the machinery and experience of State technical establishments and staffs would be made available, the Commonwealth taking the necessary financial responsibility.Third, consisting of men who though not likely to reach normal efficiency had still a useful measure of productive capacity. It was held more desirable to place these men in a position to earn a portion of their income rather than to make provision for them to live a life of idleness.Fourth, those who were totally and permanently incapacitated. These would be accommodated in hospitals attractively situated, surrounded by a generous measure
of comfort. Those who were in a position to remain in their, own homes or amongst friends, ami who preferred to do so, could have special financial provision supplementary to pensions. 1 uFifth, were the blind. These would be trained either at St. Dunstans England or locally under arrangement with the controlling- authorities of several &quot;blind institutions in the various States. .Special provision was made for the widows and for the care and education of the children of fallen soldiers.NEW ZEALAND.Shipping for Samoan Copra. The Dominion Ministers have called the attention of the British Government to the fact that merchants in the Samoan Islands are unable to obtain the necessary vessels to ship copra to San Francisco in pursuance of their contracts. The difficulty has arisen, it is stated, through the commandeering by the United States of certain sailing vessels which had been chartered by the Samoan merchants with the approval of the Washington shipping authorities. In view of the probable suspension of Samoan trade, and the consequent inability of the natives to buy stores, if the necessary shipping cannot be obtained, the Dominion Ministers fear that the situation would be exploited by German sympathisers in Samoa in order to disparage British administration. They therefore ask that steps may be taken to approach the United States on the subject.SOUTH AFRICA.Representation, at Peace Conference. In reply to a question in Parliament the Prime Minister (General Botha) said, according to a Press telegram, that it was impossible for him to say at this stage whether the Union would be represented at the Peace Conference, although he hoped that it would. They must first see, he added, whether the Union was invited to send a representative.General TLerlzog on Republicanism and Empire Relations. The eagerly anticipated speech of the Nationalist Leader (General Hertzog) was delivered in his constituency of Smithfield (O. F. S. Province) on May 4th. He kept to his undertaking to speak in favour ol peaceful methods for he warned the people against violence, laying stress again on the point that the salvation of the country day along constitutional lines. This, he said, was the day of small nations, and he was prepared to take Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilson at their word and accept their promise of sacred liberty and right.Dealing with Republican propanganda, General Hertzog undertook to abandon activities in this direction for the present. He said he could appreciate the attitude of English-speaking South Africans. They were concerned with one of the greatest wars the world had ever seen. There was hardly one who had not lost a relative, and they lived in a state of continuous tension. He did not wish to hurt their feelings, and therefore lie must refrain from active Republican propaganda.Regarding the alleged subjection of the Union to the British Parliament, General Hertzog reiterated his objection to the doctrine of Ministers that South Africa came under the British Parliament. He complained, again, that the Government &quot;had.acted as agents of the Imperial Government in connection with the German South-West African Expedition, the wool question, and the question of coaling facilities for Netherlands shipping.As to the possibility of an Empire Parliament, the Nationalist Leader declared that attempts to place South Africa under an Empire Parliament or an Empire Government would make the position a thousand times worse. He then foreshadowed a Congress of all the Nationalist leaders to discuss the establishment of an Empire Parliament, with which South Africa was threatened. The Congress, he said, should prepare against such a calamity.General Hertzog&quot; in the course of his speech referred to what he described as the statement of a responsible British statesman that when the war is over no raw5081-26 B
material from any Dominion, including, of course, South Africa, would be allowed to go to Germany until Great Britain and the Allies had been supplied. He concluded by asking whether this was another appropriation of South At&apos;rica&apos;s rights by Great Britain.Recruiting by Substitution. The Prime Minister issued on May 2nd an appeal for recruits to fill the gaps in the &quot; South African brigade in Europe which has&quot; won a splendid reputation, not alone as fighters,, but also as gentlemen.&quot; The &quot;Prime Minister emphasised that it was &quot;absolutely essential to send larger forces to represent South Africa, and dwelt on the splendid spirit in which young South Africans were responding to the call and the untiring zeal of the recruiting committees. In the appeal referred to, lie particularly addressed men of wealth and others in these words: &quot;If you cannot go yourself, send your substitute.&quot; Such wealthy men, General Botha proceeded, would then be directly represented in the struggle and would be able to share the great personal sacrifices of others. They could make arrange-ments with substitutes, he pointed out, either themselves or through the Prime Minister. He announced that he would open a list for the names of South Africans willing to provide five, three or any other number of substitutes.In a&apos; later statement, General Botha explained that South Africa was well acquainted with the above principle, which had already been in vogue in all wars in South Africa. Substitutes, he said, would also get all privileges, such as Government pensions and contributions from the Governor-Generals fund. The intention was to get men, not money-. The Premier is sending out recruiting agents for the special purpose of recruiting substitutes, and the satisfactory response is illustrated to some extent by the fact that all Ministers, all Unionist members of the House of Assembly, and many of the South African Party members have already put down their names to find substitutes.Enlistment of Temporarily Unfit.-A Renter message from Pretoria states that official instructions have been received&apos; from the War Office enabling the Defence Department to enlist for oversea the men who have been declared temporarily unfit owing to illness contracted in East or Central Africa. Those who have been rejected on account of malaria or dysentery have, therefore, been requested to present themselves for re-examination.Business in Parliament. The closing stages of the business before the House of Assembly included the passing of the Third Reading of the Factories Bill and the War Special Pensions Bill.Enemy Holdings in Mines. In the Union House of Assembly on May 4th the Mining Leases Bill passed the Third Reading. In the course of the debate, the leader of the Labour Party (Colonel Creswell) introduced an amendment prohibiting the acceptance of tenders from any company containing enemy subjects or shareholders. The Government opposed the amendment, which was rejected by 42 votes to 23. Replying to Colonel Creswell, who epioted the case of the Consolidated Mines Selection, in which 20 per cent, belonged to enemy shareholders, the Minister of Mines (Mr. Malan) quoted the Governments correspondence with the Imperial Government, in which the latter pointed out that it was an unusual practice to vest an enemy shareholding, where it did not exceed 25 per cent., although the shares were controlled. The Union Government, Mr. Malan added, felt unable to ask the Imperial Government to vest the Consolidated. Selection shares unless the British shareholders wished to take action.INDIA.(Excluding external affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Representation at Imperial War Cabinet. With reference, to the statement of Mr. Lloyd George of May 17th, 1917, that India would be represented at future meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India and a representative of the Indian people, a telegram was sent to the Viceroy on March 21st
last at the request of the War Cabinet, intimating that British India would be represented at the meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet by an accredited member, and that a Representative of the Native States would take part in the meetings of the Imperial Conference, and would attend meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet,: on the invitation of the Prime Minister, on the same footing as Ministers of the Dominions accompanying their Prime Ministers. On this basis, the Viceroy has nominated the Horn Sir Satyendra Prasanna Sinha to attend the forthcoming sessions of the Imperial War Cabinet .and Conference, and he has accepted nomination. The Viceroy has invited His Highness the Maharaja of Patiala, G.C.I.E., G-.B.E., to attend the Imperial War Conference as representing the Indian States&apos; and His Highness has accepted the invitation.Delhi Conference. The Delhi Conference was- opened on April 27th bv the Viceroy who stated in his opening speech, according to Press reports, that the Conference had met to demonstrate that lndia&apos;s word, given in time of peace, held good in the iron time of war. After referring to the military situation, the A7iceroy described the menace resulting from the Russian Revolution which &quot;opened another door through Southern Russia to the confines of Eastern Persia and Afghanistan, and he declared, that the Ameer of Afghanistan had kept his royal pledge to maintain neutrality in spite of the attempts of the enemy to seduce him from his purpose. Lord Chelmsford stated that he had no doubt that adhesion to the present system of recruiting would continue to secure large numbers of men, but he wanted to feel that he was carrying India herself along, and he wanted her to realise that this was her Avar and that her- sons avIio went to fight went for their own motherland. He said that arrangements made with the United States would relieve the strain of the silver position.- The Conference was attended by 16 princes, the non-official members of the Legislative. Council, and about 100 representatives selected by the Proviuces from all shades of political opinion. The Home Rule group showed some feeling at the non-inclusion of Mr. Tilak and Mrs. Besant, but this was opposed to the general tone of the Conference. After the opening ceremony, the Conference resofved itself into Committees to deal with questions of man-power and development, and important recommendations were adopted. Various matters having reference to the Indian Army were also discussed. The continuance of recruiting upon a voluntary basis and the formation of publicity and employment bureaux were approved, and the immediate constitution of Provincial Committees was recommended for the purpose of co-operating with the Munitions Board and other authorities in furthering economy of railway traffic, encouragement of consumption locally of local products, control generally of supplies, immediate development of the programme for construction of shipping, and the development of production of foodstuffs and war requirements. Resolutions urging the Government and the public to practice economy in the use of materials were also carried.Speaking generalD, the object of the Conference, which was to enlighten India generally on the situation and to enlist the co-operation of prominent men in the measures necessary, was achieved.- A policy of increased effort, to be worked out by the Provinces under the guidance of the Central Government was formulated. The Conference indicated appreciation of the situation and a cordial desire to furnish further assistance to the cause of the Empire. It is hoped that the measures advocated in the resolutions will serve to educate the people as to needs and obligations, and that as a result of the stimulation of recruiting, half a million recruits will be obtained during the year. . The offers of assistance from the Chiefs in men and money were most generous.At the sitting of the Conference on April 29th, the Gaekwar of Baroda moved a resolution which is reported in the Press as requesting the Viceroy to convey to the Ling an expression of India&apos;s dutiful and loyal response to His Majesty&apos;s message, and an assurance that she would continue to do her duty to the utmost capacity in the great crisis through which the Empire was passing.This Avas supported by many speakers and subsequently carried.A. further resolution endorsing the recommendations of the Committees Avas moved by the Maharajah of Kashmir and carried.The Man-PoAver Committee supported a large increase in voluntary recruiting and, Avhile considering conscription unnecessary at present, they impressed upon the Government the necessity of granting a substantial number of commissions to Indians and also of making an increase in the pay of the Indian soldiers.56S1- 2n c
The Resources Committee recommended the practice of economy, and stated their belief that all classes would welcome Government control and. regulation of materials necessary for victory.In his final speech the Viceroy declared that the proceedings were both an experience and an inspiration. They had come from every.part of India, and sunk all minor differences, to unite in doing what they could for King and country. When the record of the Conference went forth, the Empire would agree that-Indians were quitting themselves like men.Manifesto by Mrs. Besant and Mr. Tilak. A maulfesto issued by Mrs. Besant Mr. Tilak and others has been published in the Press. In the course of this statement the following-passages occur :  &quot; We do not want to break our tie with England ; we do not want to see it broken by a war into which she entered in defence of liberty : we detest German tyranny and. German methods ; we do not want to change our masters, but to share their freedom and to live in a happy union of ecpials for the mutual advantage of both. We are ready to make sacrifices, to fight and work. Responsible government is promised, but the promise is indefinite. Pet England pledge herself definitely to redeem that promise, and we will work heart and soul to save great Britain and India, and the Empire.&quot;COLONIES AND PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.War Effort. Tbe Administrator of Southern Rhodesia (Sir Drummond Chaplin) in opening the Legislative Council of Southern Rhodesia, stated that 1,250 Europeans had left Southern Rhodesia for active service, excluding those attached to the native regiment. The deficit for the past year was less formidable than had been anticipated. In order to meet shortage in the Customs revenue due to the restriction of shipping facilities, temporary taxation measures would be introduced. The British South Africa Company was further contributing a sum equivalent to the taxes on its commercial interests, and it was hoped thereby to provide funds for increasing war pensions to the Union level and to give other assistance to soldiers. Sir Drummond thanked tlie Union Government for its co-operation in regard to the shortage of mining and other supplies.NIGERIA.Nigeria&apos;s Gift. The Governor-General of Nigeria (Sir F. Lugard), in writing to the Times to correct an error, states that Nigeria offered to pay the interest on a share of the Imperial war debt amounting to 0,000,000?., plus a sinking fund charge of 1 per cent, per annum, until the debt of 6,000,000L is extinguished by the operation of the sinking fund. The cost to Nigeria, he points out, will be about 13,250,0001. spread over 36 years.GERMANY IN AFRICA. AND THE PACIFIC.Supply of Raw Materials. Herr Emil Zimmermann, the German writer on Colonial matters, has contributed further articles upon the importance of Africa as a source of. supply of raw materials to Germany., Writing on April loth, Herr Zimmermann said : &quot; We shall have to make our deductions &quot;ruthlessly from our military superiority. After further great events in the West, our Colonial demands must in no circumstances continue to be confined to the Belgian and French Congo territories. I call attention to the fact that in the year 1913 Nigeria exported 175,000 tons of palm kernels, and
-Sierra Leone nearly 50,000 tons; &quot;Nigeria also delivered. 83,000 tons of palm oil. Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Congo territories are in a position to deliver immediately over 300,000 tons of palm kernels and palm oil, and, even if the utmost consideration is given to French interests in Africa, I can very well conceive a German Colonial Empire in Central Africa and in the South Seas which would supply immediately 400,000 tons of oil-fruits and more than f,000,000 tons at an early date ; it would make us almost entirely- independent in the important question of our supply of raw materials of oil.&quot;Economic Value of German Pacific Colonies. -Admiral Governor A. D. von Truppel has contributed an article to the Weser-Zeitung ol April 17th upon the recent memorial of German South Sea firms, relating to the economic value of German Colonies in the Pacific (vide Report No. 53). The writer says that the memorial is not directed against the Government, but starts with the recognition that the latter has framed its programme clearly and plainly7 on the view that &quot; we wish to have again the colonial possessions which have fallen into the enemy&apos;s hands.&quot; Moreover, he says, &quot; Solf has repeatedly and publicly declared with the most welcome decisiveness That as a pre-liminary condition to all plans for the future of the colonies, theneAv &quot;partition of Africa.&apos; included, we must recover all our colonies.&quot; This, in the Admirahs opinion, is the only7 possible attitude for the Government to take, and one which the German people must make its own.Admiral von Truppel states, however, that &quot; the memorial is in no way opposed to the idea of rounding-off our African colonies. It does not emphasise the obvious point that, at all events for the first few years of shortage of raw material after the war, it is our old colonies, and especially7 those of the South Sea, which will quickly be able to alleviate our needs in oil, fats, fodder, phosphate, rubber, cocoa, &amp;c. On the other hand, any7 new colonial acquisition would at first only7 entail a burden, and would be a bill at long date. Further, those who support the &apos; Middle Europe &apos; idea are entirely7 wrong when they7 think that this will allow us more or less to dispense with our colonies. FriedericliNaumann himself says : &apos; At no price should we let ourselves be deprived of our colonial activities, and if it is unavoidable we must concede the districts in Europe which we have occupied in order to remain a colonial nation.&apos; &quot;Dealing with the purely economic aspects discussed in the memorial, the Admiral comments that the first part of the memorial deals with the economic relations, the previous results, and the future possibilities. The total value of the South Sea colonies before the war is estimated at about 22,500,000Z. To this amount-officially calculated for purposes of war compensation one must add, he says, the value of the minerals, fishing rights, forests, mines, and also the yearly increasing fertility of the plantations. The most recent calculations make the total value of New Guinea and Samoa Mk. 1,39.1 &quot;8 million, compared with Mk. 1,609&quot;4 for SAY. Africa, and estimate the South Sea phosphate deposits at Mk. 1,125 million, as compared with Mk. 1,200 million, the value of the diamond mines of SAY. Africa.Discussing the relative advantages of the South Sea colonies and African possessions so far as peace questions are concerned, Admiral von Truppel writes : &quot; Finally it should be pointed out that under given circumstances there should be fewer difficulties at the conclusion of peace ir* recovering our South Sea colonies than in acquiring new possessions in Africa ; this alone ought to hinder one from playing with the idea of renunciation in the South Sea.&quot;
