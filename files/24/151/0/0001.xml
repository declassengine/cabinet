BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.The Dominion Governments were informed by telegraph on January 3rd that the British Government considered it necessary to make a reply to recent declarations regarding terms of peace, and that the Prime Minister would consequently make a statement in the course of a day or two. This statement, it was pointed out, would, indicate no change of policy, and the text would he telegraphed directly the statement was made.At the meetings of the War Cabinet held on January 3rd and 4th, when the question of war aims was amongst the matters discussed, Sir Edward Kemp, the Canadian Minister of Overseas Forces, was present, by invitation of Mr. Lloyd George. By the presence also at these meetings of the Secretary of State for the Colonies and General Smuts, Imperial participation in the decision was secured so far as this was possible in the urgent circumstances of the moment, and a note to this effect appears in the War Cabinet Minutes.The Governments of the Australian Commonwealth, the Dominion of New Zealand and the Union of South Africa have been informed that the British Government consider it necessary for the future security of the Empire to retain possession of the captured German colonies, but that there is a divergence of opinion amongst the Allies, militating,against the general acceptance of this view. Owing to the Russian attitude, manifested during the peace negotiations with Germany, regarding the right of populations to determine their future, the above-mentioned Dominion Governments are asked to furnish statements concerning the*wishes of the natives of German New Guinea, Samoa, and German South-West Africa to live under British rule. The suggestions of oversea Ministers on the subject are invited.CANADA.In reply to the telegram from the British Government asking the Dominion Prime Minister whether he would wish the AVar Cabinet to in Ante the Canadian Minister of Overseas Military Forces (Sir Edward Kemp) to attend their meetings if occasion offered (sec Report No. 45, under &quot;Imperial Affairs&quot;), Sir R. Borden telegraphed, stating that he would like Sir Edward Kemp to be invited to attend the War Cabinet for consultation on appropriate occasions (for announcement regarding the first meeting attended by Sir E. Kemp, see under &quot; Imperial Affairs &quot;).The Minister of Overseas Military Forces has Avelcoined Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s statement on Avar aims, and has declared: &quot;Canada is certainly not fighting for &quot; conquest, but she is making a great sacrifice in order that she, with sister nations &quot; and the Motherland, may retain the blessings of democratic government.&quot;The Prime Minister of the Dominion has telegraphed to the British Prime Minister thanking him for his NeAv Year&apos;s message, and stating that the GoArernment and people of the Dominion rejoice to feel that Canada has been privileged to play her part in the struggle of democracy against autocracy, and they renew their solemn and unalterable resolve to continue with unabated vigour and resolution to aid in the overthrow of the military autocracy which seeks to crush the liberties of Europe and the world.A notable New Year message has been sent to His Majesty the King by the Lieutenant-GoArernor of Quebec (Mr. Leblanc), in the coarse of which he eom^eyed on behalf of his Ministers and the people of the Province an expression of devoted loyalty and pledged the ProAnnce once more as a continued and determined participant of the struggle for that decisive victory which will ensure to the ayoiIcI the blessing of
a righteous and abiding peace. &quot; For this/&apos; the message added, &quot; we right and pray.&quot; In reply, His Majesty expressed his. conviction that he could count on the determined participation of his people all Quebec in the struggle now being waged for liberty and civilisation.The Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec has also issued an important message to the people of the Province, which states :  &quot; Pledged as are the provinces and the country to continue a determined participation iii the war, it is nw earnest hope that a spirit of reconciliation and unity may henceforth animate all the peoples of my beloved country, so as better to co-operate in bringing about, in the not distant future, that decisive victory which will ensure to the world the blessings of a righteous and abiding-peace.&quot;As to men reporting for duty in Quebec Province under the Military Service Act, it is to be noted that 150 French-Canadians reported up to 8th January to Peel Street Barracks in Montreal. It appears that comparatively few have reported in Quebec as most of those who come under the Act have their cases under appeal.The Premier of Quebec (Sir Eoiuer Gouin) states that the Dominion Order-in-Council. requiring ail provincial and other flotations of bond issues to be first approved by the Dominion Minister of Finance is unconstitutional, and that his Government does not consider the regulations as binding on the Province. The Minister oil Finance (Sir T. White) announces, however, that the Dominion Order was constitutionally upheld by the Department of Justice, and that a denial of the Governments right to pass such an order would &quot; seriously curtail the exclusive &quot; jurisdiction of the Dominion in the matter of national defence.&quot; From the stand-point of the Avar the Minister declares &quot; there can be no question as to the advisability of the measure.&quot;The Minister of Marine Fisheries and Naval Service (Colonel Ballantyne) has announced that the Government will use the full capacity of the Dominion shipyards in order to produce modern shell cargo steamers of the latest pattern. The capacity of the yards is estimated at 800,000 tons. During the war the construction of shell ships for foreign countries will not be permitted in Dominion yards.The choice of a successor to Mr. Rowell in the leadership of the Liberals of Ontario has fallen upon Mr. W. Proudfoot, who will thus lead the Opposition in the Provincial Legislature.NEWFOUNDLAND.In consequence of the retirement of Sir Edward Alorris from the Premiership, the Newfoundland Cabinet has been reconstructed as follows : Dr. W. F. Lloyd   -Mr. M. P. Cashik Mr. J. A. Clift, K.C. Mr. J. 0. Crosbie Mr. W. Woodford Mr. W. W. Halfyard Mr. W. J. Ellis Mr. W. F. Coaker -Mr. A. E. Hickman  -Prime   Minister   and   Minister   ofJ ustice. Minister of Finance. Minister of Agriculture. Minister of Militia. Minister of Public Works. Colonial Secretary. Leader of the Upper House.Ministers without portfolios.All the above previously occupied posts in the Cabinet except Mr. Woodford, wdio replaces the ex-Prime Minister.His Majesty the King has conferred a Barony of the United Kingdom upon Sir E. Morris in recognition of his long and distinguished services to the Empire.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Hughes) has tendered to the Governor-General the unconditional resignation of his Cabinet, and he is now engaged in forming a new Ministry.    On the resignation of Mr. Hughes, the Governor-General
asked the Ministry to continue in office until their successors were appointed and he then sent for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor), who, however, has: announced that he has not been asked to form a Government, but has, no to the-present, merely given his advice. In the event of Mr. Tudor undertaking to form a Ministry, there is little doubt that he would advise the Governor-General to dissolve Parliament, as the Official Labour Party are faced with a large majority&quot; against them in both the Senate and House of Representatives. It is reported that several of Mr. TudoFs supporters are in favour of a Coalition with the Nationalists provided that Mr. Hughes does not remain in the Government.In view of the possibility of Mr. Tudor again taking Office, it is interesting to-recall that he was Minister for Trade and Customs under Mr. Andrew Fisher, and also occupied that position in Mr. Hughes&apos; Cabinet until he resigned upon the question of conscription and was subsequently elected Leader of the Official Labour Party. Though opposed to conscription, it should be added that the Official Labour Party in their Manifesto issued to the people at the last General Election, indicated their attitude to the Avar in the following words : &quot; The war is still the most pressing &quot; and insistent question confronting us. . . . Our attitude as a Party is identical &quot; with our attitude at the last election, and the best pledge of our future intentions is &quot; to be found in our past xjerformauces. When, in office, we conducted the war with &quot; vigour and determination. . . . If again entrusted with the control of Australians &quot; share in the war, we will continue under the voluntary system to secure the services &quot; of every man lit and willing to proceed to the Front.&quot;In anticipation of a ]DOssible General Election, the electoral organisations throughout Australia are busy making all necessary preparations.The events which led up to the resignation of the Government may he outlined as follows : At the meeting of the National Party on 3rd January, the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) stated that it was the intention of the Government to resign in order to fulfil their Referendum pledge. All the Ministers&apos; decided to stand or fall together except the Commonwealth Treasurer (Sir John Forrest), who declined to associate himself with the decision of his colleagues on the ground that he was not present at the meeting when the Referendum was made the vital issue. The Party resolved at this meeting by 63 votes to 2 that Mr. Hughes should remain as leader of the Party. The con-si deration of the action to be taken by reason of the pledge was adjourned to the next day, when the Party decided by an overwhelming majority that &quot;this-&quot; Party in view of the recently declared attitude of the official Labour Party on the &quot; vital question of the conduct, of the war and peace, declares that in the interests &quot; of the country and the Empire, it will not support any course of action that will &quot; hand the country over to the official Labour Party.&apos;&apos; It was then proposed that the Government should honour their pledge by resigning, and that Mr. Austin Chapman should be asked to form a Government. An amendment was moved to this in favour of the matter being left in the hands of the Government to take whatever steps it deemed advisable with a view to giving effect to the pledge. This amendment was carried with seven dissentients. The result of the Cabinet meeting on 5th January is set out above. Commenting on the Nationalist Party Resolution, Sir William Irvine (who may be regarded as one of the strongest advocates of conscription amongst the public men. of the Commonwealth) stated thalt it threw upon the Government the full responsibility of honouring its pledge namely,, to resign in the event of the Referendum failing to secure a majority in favour of conscription.Referring to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s statement on war aims, Mr. Hughes has stated that it tears down the veil of hypocritical pretence which Germany is seeking to-impose oii the Bolshevists, and removes all misconceptions. He hailed the - speech, as &quot; a great statesmanlike declaration of the views of the Empire and its Allies,&quot; and as &quot; a proof of the Allies&apos; resolution to continue the war until victory is achieved.&quot;Hie latest figures show that the Referendum majority against conscription is now&apos; 168,786.Cp to the present the soldiers&apos; vote in the Referendum indicate : For      - - - - -   82,655Against   - -    -    - - - -   81,940Majority for        - -       715MMMBM8MWHMWMBMM8ftHW ........... .. .. -*-\
The High Court will shortly hear an application, by the Premier of Queensland (Mr. Ryan) for the committal of Mr. Hughes for contempt of Gourt in connection with the publication.of a telegram sent by Mr. Hughes to Mr. Ryan. This telegram, it is claimed, tended to interfere with the fair and impartial hearing of a charge, against Mr. Ryan for conspiring to distribute an anti-conscription circular without permission of the Censor.Tile Commonwealth Government are very anxious to commence a Naval Ail-Service, and the British Admiralty have been asked for the loan of an officer who can be sent to Australia to advise on the subject.Tire New South Wales Government have undertaken to supply Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia with all the coal they need during the next live years.The Premier of New South Wales (Mr. Holman) is in communication with the other State Premiers with a view to presenting a joint protest against the creation of the new Federal Constabulary.   (Vide Report No. 46.)NEW ZEALAND.In reply to the New Year message from Mr. Lloyd George, the Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) states that &quot; To-day the Empire is more firmly united than at any period in its history, &apos; while its peoples are more than ever determined to carry on to a victorious &apos;     conclusion.   We trust the Allies will, stand together until a decisive victory has been gained, and that no terms will be considered which, if agreed in, may result in anything other than a permanent peace, and at the same time be a salutary warning to covetous and unscrupulous nations in the future.&quot;The Prime Minister has declared that the Germans in the Pacific are bad neighbours, and that Australians and New Zealanders do not want them there again.The Prime Minister states that plans are being prepared for settlement after the war which include a vigorous public works policy designed to absorb 12,000 men immediately on their return. An area of land valued at 30,000L has been allocated by the Government for the use of returned soldiers. This land will be leased at a moderate rental, and the revenue devoted to assisting other, soldiers.Idie Minister of Defence (Sir James Allen) has again emphatically denied the rumour that he will go to London next year to succeed Sir Thomas Mackenzie as High Commissioner for the Dominion.SOUTH AFRICA.Idie Union Minister of Railways (Mr. Burton), in a speech appealing for national unity and condemning Republican propaganda, stated that the Government had gone to the extremes of leniencw. Their record, he said, regarding the rebellion was not weakness, but was due to their, wish to do nothing to embitter relations after the war. But, he added, there were limits even to such leniency and the Government intended to deal very drastically with any instances in future.With regard to the enquiry as to the export of maize to Holland (vide Report No. 4-8) the Union Government have been informed that the immediate importation, of maize would impede negotiations which are now proceeding between the Allied representatives and Dxitch delegates in order to re-arrange the rationing system. The British Government have therefore asked the Union Government to let the matter stand over for the present.At the recent meetings of the South African Trade Union Congress, a proposal to admit coloured delegates was rejected by a large majority.
GERMAN  EAST AFRICA.General Northey reports tliat the detachment of the enemy in the Mvrembe district apparently consists of about three companies. The column Under General Murray continues to hold the Songea and Tunduru districts.CYPRUS.The Greek newspapers have quoted a telegram in Idea Nazionale of Rome to the effect that the British Government have promised Monsieur Venizelos that Cyprus shall be ceded to Greece at the termination of the war. The papers acknowledge that the present government of Cyprus is good, but argue that the desires of the people to be united to their mother country should be met.
APPENDIXTOWestern and General Report, No. 50.Australasia and War Aims in the Pacific.The attitude of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand towards the German menace in the Pacific has been to a large extent influenced by a consideration of the past history of the Pacific region, though the general standpoint and policy has undoubtedly been fortified by the experiences of the present war.PAST EFFORTS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS.The difficulty of appreciating the point of view of the inhabitants of the countries situated in Pacific Seas was referred to with considerable emphasis during the 1907 Imperial Conference by the then Prime Minister of Australia (Mr. Deakin). Speaking on the subject of British interests in the Pacific, he said : &apos;&quot;&apos; Some reference &quot; is necessary to the indifferent attitude of statesmen in this country,,a not unnatural-&quot; attitude, because, to the United Kingdom, the Pacific is remote, and not for the &quot; greater part of it even a highway of much traffic. On the other hand, to Australia &quot; and New Zealand in particular, and also to Canada, the future of the Pacific is &quot; extremely important, and may become more so at any time. . . . This difference &quot; of situation led from the first to a different attitude of mind on the part of the &quot; people . of the Commonwealth and New Zealand, the people of Australasia,- as &quot; compared with that of the people of the Mother Country. - As a consequence, the il course that has been followed, and consistently followed, in Australia has neither &quot; been understood nor appreciated here.&quot;It was owing to the belief in Queensland that the British Government was viewing German activity with indifference that the Premier of the State took the bold step of annexing part of New Guinea in 1883, but this act was declared by the British authorities to be &quot; null in point of law and not to be admitted in point of policy.&quot; The Convention of the Australian Colonies which was called to discuss the matter was of considerable significance, for it was the first occasion that the separate Colonies of Australia gave really joint consideration &quot;to the external danger threatening them through the action of a foreign Power. The Convention suggested that a Protectorate should be proclaimed over New Guinea and the adjacent islands (including the New Britain Archipelago, Solomon. Caroline, Palau, Marshall and Ladrone Islands) under a single High Commissioner, but this scheme did not receive encouragement from the Home Government.It is to be observed that the position in 1883 did not material^ differ from the situation to-day in that the main groups of islands round the shores of Australia were practically under British control.The German flag, however, was soon after hoisted in New Guinea, in spite of the protests of Australia, though it is true that the southern portions were broLight under British control, and subsequently taken over and administered hy the Commonwealth under the Papua Act of 1905. As to the manner in which Australian feeling was met by the threatened German annexation, Mr. Deakin pointed out at the 1907 Conference, &quot; I remember only too well the warnings transmitted to the Imperial &quot; Government with reference to New Guinea when we were assured by the then &quot; Secretary of State for the Colonies (Lord Derby) that there was no intention on the &quot; part of Germany to annex any part of that island. It was in this faith that the flag &apos;&quot; hoisted without authority by the Governor of Queensland, the British flag, was &quot; hauled down.&quot; As Mr. Deakin also pointed out, the territory regarding which the assurance was made was immediately afterwards appropriated by the German Government, and he continued : &quot; What is true of this island is true of the Solomon and the Gilbert and the Eilice Islands.   Whatever losses there are in the Pacific 
and there have been others have been due to neglect here. Every single gain has-been due to pressure from Australia and New Zealand . . . . Is it, therefore, &apos;; to be wondered at that a feeling has been created which still exists in Australia an &apos;&apos; exasperated feeling that British Imperial interests in that Ocean have been &apos;&apos; mishandled from the first. . . . We practically had these islands, or most of &apos;&apos; them, almost as much as we had Australia in the first instance. It is not a series of grasping annexations that we have been attempting, but a series of aggravating &apos;: and exasperating losses which we have had to sustain. There you have our two &apos;&quot;&apos; absolutely opposite points of view, the point of view of our part of the world and the &quot; point of view of this country.&quot;&apos;With regard to Samoa, Germain-had established herself commercially in 188-1,. and began to press the other countries commercially interested (Great Britain and the United States) for a greater administrative control, basing this claim mainly on the native disturbances and the necessity for &quot;repressive measures for the establishment of law and order.&quot; After a short period of Samoan administration by an Ad visor v Council to the native King, the German Commissioner proposed that &apos;: having regard &quot; to the great preponderance of German commercial interest in Samoa, the task of&quot; &quot; forming a better administration should be entrusted in the first instance, to the &quot; German Government.&quot; Germany subsequently took action against the native King (Malietoa) and drove him from power, in order &quot; to take reprisals,&quot; and he Avas afterwards deposed.By the Convention signed at Berlin in 18S9, the Samoan Islands were declared to-be independent neutral territory, Great Britain, Germany, and the United States having equal rights, and the native King was again recognised. Owing, however, to-unsatisfactory administration and differences between the Chiefs, the New Zealand Government in 1S94 proposed to establish a Protectorate1 and to undertake the administration of the islands. Great Britain and Germany, however, took joint action against the natives, and in 1899 an agreement was arrived at by which the Government was to be directed by an Administrator under the Council of Consuls of Great Britain, Germany, and the United States, assisted by a native Assembly. Dr. Soil (the present German Colonial Secretary) was appointed as Administrator ; but after just over a year, the Anglo-German Convention of &quot;1900 recognised, the German control of the Samoan Islands. The attitude of New Zealand to this was well represented by the then Prime. Minister (Mr. Seddon) when he said : &quot; Some &quot; definite action of a forward character is required in the Pacific at the earliest &quot; opportune moment, for the surrender of Samoa has disheartened the natives in the &quot; island, disappointed the people of Australasia, and lowered the prestige of Great &quot; Britain in this part of the world.&quot;PRESENT ATTITUDE.The general attitude of the statesmen of Australasia towards the German menace in the Pacific in relation to the captured territory was referred to in Appendix to the Western and General Report, No. 19, but since the date of that Report, a-various pronouncements have been made. The general position adopted by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Hughes) has. however, not been more clearly put than in his statement of the 18th. May, when he said that &quot; While the idea of &quot; territorial aggrandizement is repugnant to our ideals and our policy, yet common &quot; prudence and regard for the eieation of such conditions as will make for a lasting &quot; peace will compel the Allies to annex such territory as will safeguard the future of &quot; civilisation. It is perfectly obvious, for example, that we cannot contemplate peace &quot; that would mean a restoration to Germany of an opportunity to create, at our very &quot; doors, means for farther onslaughts upon Australia. The destiny of Australasia &quot; depends upon the control of the Pacific being in the hands of the Empire and its &quot; Allies.&quot; -Again, the Premier of New South Wales (Mr. Holm an) in a speech in New York last September, was equally emphatic when he said, &quot; We had no end to gain by &quot; entering upon the war, but it is a fact that as a result of the war the territory of Northern New Guinea has fallen into our hands   .   .   .   We propctek to keep it.1 The Native Chiefs in 1S77 petitioned Great Britain to establish a Protectorate over the islands.
&quot; We.do not propose to let the Germans come back there and establish a base of &quot; operations against us.&quot; v ,Mr. Holman, in claiming to speak with some knowledge of Australian feeling and! desires, further stated the reasons for Australia^ apprehension regarding the return of New Guinea to Germany in the following words :  - &quot; German New Guinea, now in Australian hands, borders for many hundred miles that other portion of the island which is Australian, and would furnish a base, naval and aerial, for future hostile enterprises against Australia. German New Guinea is within four days&apos; steam of Australia^ northern (Queensland) ports, and within another three days of New South Wales ports.&quot;The retention of New Guinea by Germany after a war from which Germany had emerged uncrushed would mean to Australia &apos;: (1) Idle fortifying and guarding of the New Guinea frontier; &quot; (2) The fortification of all East Coast ports ;&quot; (3) The immobilisation of a large destroyer fleet for defence only on the East (&quot;oast station; &apos;       ;&quot; (4) The imperilling of the trade route via the North Coast of Australia in war time ;- &quot; (5) Continuous menace to Sydney Australia&apos;s largest town and chiefport.&quot; . . . . For these reasons Australia proposes to keep New Guinea out of German hands.&quot;In view of the possibility of Mr. Hughes&apos; resignation giving to the Official Labour Party a position of greater influence and power, it is interesting to recall the statement of policy regarding the Pacific Colonies which, was outlined in the programme issued by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) on behalf of that-Party at the last General Election.   It was there stated : &quot; Recent developments in aerial and submarine warfare indicate the perils which would threaten this continent if a potential enemy were permitted to acquire or resume sovereignty of the islands adjacent to Australia. In enemy control these islands would furnish numerous bases of operations for incessant raids on our coasts.&quot;It is indeed the danger to Australia of the re-establishment of Germany in the adjacent islands that influences the judgment of statesmen in the Southern Seas ; and the position adopted by the leading men of Australia and New Zealand was emphasised in the resolution passed hy the Commonwealth Senate in August last to the following effect : &quot;That the Senate expresses its unqualified   appreciation and approval of the statement made on  the 31st January last by the Colonial Secretary (Mr.   Walter  Long),   which   emphatically   sets   forth   that  none   of   the -captured Colonial possessions of the German Empire will, in any circnm-&apos; stances, be returned to thitt Power ; and, furthermore, resolves that any proposal to restore the captured German territories in the vicinity of the Australian Continent will be  particularly distasteful to  the people of the&apos;-. Commonwealth, and prejudicial to their interests, as well as to the future peace of the world.&quot;With regard to the statement by Mr. Lloyd George of June last that the great International Peace Congress would have to settle the fate of the German Colonies, but that the wishes, desires, and interests of the people of the countries themselves must be the dominating factor in settling their future Government, Mr. Hughes stated that his silence must not be taken to mean acquiescence with the view expressed by Mr. Lloyd George as to the desires and wishes of the peoples of the German Colonies being the dominating factor. It should be observed, however, that quite recently JVIr. Hughes has again dealt with the subject and declared that &quot;The future of Australia and New Zealand and the Pacific generalL wall be settled not by what the people in those places desire but by the Peace Conference. If Germany is victorious,&quot; he added, &quot;she will take as much of Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific as she wants and she will most certainly demand the right of free entry for her goods.&quot;
So far as New Zealand is concerned, the Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) emphasised the position of his Dominion once again in the New Zealand Parliament on the 3rd July last to the following effect : &quot;&quot;If these German Colonies in the South Pacific are allowed to become what may be called pawns in the political game, and are given back at the end of the war (and I do not think there is a chance, of that now) what it would.mean would be this: they would be occupied by our present enemy, by citizens of the German Empire; but, in addition to that, these islands if they are given back to Germany would mean that naval bases would be established, in the Pacific ; that wireless stations would be erected ; that they would become the headquarters for submarines, and probably the headquarters of airships in some form.&quot;The Finance Minister (Sir Joseph Ward who, as Leader of the Liberal Party, occupies practically a co-equal position with Mr. Massey in the National Government), was equally emphatic, when he said in the House of Representatives on the same date &quot; It would be a crime against the people of the Oversea Dominions in the Pacific, if &quot; these islands were ever allowed to revert either to Germany or to any other foreign&quot; country.....There is no misunderstanding on the part of the people of this&quot; Dominion as to what our views are as to the future of the islands in the Pacific. I &quot; believe that if 3rou were to poll this country from one end to the other upon that &quot; very great question, and if the people were told that by now giving them up we &quot; might have to fight for it over again, rather than give up the Islands of the Pacific, &quot; they would prefer to carry on the conflict until such an awful possibility were &quot; eliminated.&quot;Towards the end of the last Session of Parliament, Mr. Massey announced that he had impressed upon the Imperial Authorities the importance to Australasia of Ocean and Naura Islands, and he had received a promise that nothing would be done in the direction of disposing of them without consultation with the Dominions in the Pacific. Later, Mr. Massey stated that the British Government had been informed that &quot; We &quot; are not going to have the Germans back in the islands of these seas if we can &quot; possibly help it,&quot; and that &quot;the Germans in the Pacific are bad neighbours, and Australians and New Zealanders do not want them there again.&quot;NATIVE POPULATIONS.Owing to the recent statements regarding British war aims, the composition and attitude of the inhabitants of the various captured territories becomes of special interest and importance.It would be difficult to form a reliable estimate regarding the native attitude towards British or German rule without, special investigation, but it is to be noted that so far as Samoa is concerned, the Government of New Zealand stated their view in. the course of the speech with which the Governor-General opened Parliament in June last in the following words : &quot; The Administration of the captured Samoan Islands has been efficiently carried out, and there is every reason to believe that the Native population is happjr under British control, and has no desire to revert to the conditions which prevailed prior to the occupation of New Zealand troops.&quot;The native population of German Samoa taken at the 1911 census showed 2J,1S2 in Upolu and the adjacent islands, and 12,372 in Savaii. In 1914 there were about 1,400 half-castes in the islands mentioned. The natives are Polynesians, and their education by the missionaries has resulted in most of them being able to read or write. The villages are for the most part clean, and in the social organisation the Village Councils play an important part. Each of these Cormcils has a Chief at the head (occupying a position similar to that of mayor) and, under the system practised by the Germans, a General Assembly of Chiefs met from time to time, and it was always possible to call a General Assembly for any partictdar discussion. The Govern-ment of the islands was conducted as a Crown Colony with a Government Council composed of. members holding either official or leading commercial positions in the islands. Two principal Chiefs were nominated to serve in an advisory capacity to the Government and their jfiace in. relation to the administration is best described as
*&apos; Interceders,&quot; which is a translation of the Samoan word used in this connection ; and this system enabled the views of the natives to be brought before the Govern-ment. It was also possible for natives to become members of the Government Council ; and there were both German and native magistrates.In 1908 serious disaffection occurred amongst the natives. This apparently was brought about izi a large measure through their inability to understand German methods of government, and the result was that certain Chiefs, who exercised a considerable influence in the islands, were exiled. One of the acts of the New Zealand adminis-tration of the islands was to bring these Chiefs back in the autumn of 1915, and this action is reported by the London Missionary Society to have called forth more enthusiasm amongst the natives than anything that has occurred of recent years, and to have gone far to popularise British as against German administration. Another influence tending in the last-named direction is stated to be the greater liberty of speech allowed by the British as against the German Government. A good deal of English is spoken amongst the natives on account of British trading activities, but steps were being taken in 1914 to increase the study of German in the schools. Up to 1912, pleading in the Imperial Court at Apia could be conducted in either German&apos; or English, but in that year pleading was ordered to be conducted in German alone. It may be added that the natives of the islands are not very industriotis, owing probably to the considerable productivity of the soil, which enables them to satisfy their needs with very little labour. On account of the difficulty of getting the natives to work on the plantations, the Deutsche Plantagengesellschaft obtained the right to import labour from the Solomons. The white population on 1st January 1914 was 600. of which 436 were males.-As regards Kaiser Wilhelm&apos;s Land, the native population consists of Papuans of Melanesian stock, of whom there are some 100,000, but the information obtainable mainly concerns those who inhabit the coast. The native villages are small, and the only places of importance are the European trade-stations. The Bushmen of the interior are frequently in conflict with the natives of the coast, and generally speaking, they may be considered as treacherous. Many of them are cannibals, and they h&amp;ve given the planters a good deal of trouble. The German Missions, however, along the coast, were educating some 2,000 native children in 1912. and the industrial schools have proved of considerable value.In the Bismarck Archipelago and German Solomon Islands, the population is Papuan, and estimated at about 200,000. The white population at the beginning of 1914 was 821, including German, French, and Australian missionaries. There is similar hostility between the coast natives and the bushmen as in Kaiser Wilhelm&apos;s Land.With regard to the Marshall Islands, the native population is about 9,200, including Nauru Island, which has about 2,000 people employed as phosphate workers. The white pojmlation in 1912 was about 172, including 76 Germans. The American Missions have done a good deal in spreading the English language, and the German Government had a proposal on foot in 1914 to counteract this by the institution of State schools taught in German.In the Caroline Islands, the native poptdation is about 40,000, and the native villages have the reputation of being well kept. The Chiefs are possessed of con-siderable powers, and in the island of Yap are of much service in organising the police force. 4In the Mariana Islands the native population is estimated at a little over 3,000, and it has undoubtedly much decreased since the occupation of Spain in the 17th century. In 1914 there were a few German Missionary schools, and apart from native languages, Spanish is most generally spoken. Since 1915, the islands have been administered by Japan.(H. d&apos;E.)
