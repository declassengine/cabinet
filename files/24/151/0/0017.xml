SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN ANT) GENERALREPORT No. 66.PART I.   BRITISH EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.The Budget Statement in Parliament is interesting and important. The financial discussions which have recently taken the Prime Minister and other Ministers to New York were referred to in the course of the statement.The Minister of Shipping will in all ordinary cases in the future arrange to communicate with the Dominion Governments before arriving at decisions about the diversion of shipping.The Order-in-Council requiring males between 10 and 60 to engage in a useful occupation is being put into force with vigour, and already several penalties have been imposed upon idlers.Australian Common wealth.The Nationalists have unanimously approved of the representation of Australia by Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cook at the forthcoming meetings in London. This should serve to allay criticism, by political opponents.The striking declaration of Mr. Cook upon the Pacific requires careful attention. A strong attitude on this question may be expected from Australia^ representatives.The desire of the Commonwealth for closer relationship with the United States in shipping matters is important.While the resolution passed by the Recruiting Conference is satisfactory, it does not seem clear that the official Labour Party will throw themselves into the recruiting campaign with enthusiasm until their conditions are fulfilled.Other matters of interest are the statement of Mr. Hughes regarding the purchase of zinc concentrate^, and the declaration of the Treasurer on the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and Great Britain.South Africa.In the unavoidable absence of General Botha from the meetings in London, Mr. Burton will assist General Smuts in the representation of South Africa.The Nationalist official attitude still favours peaceful methods.   General HertzGgy
in his latest utterance, restates main&apos; of his previous declarations of an anti-Empire character.The extension of the vote to soldiers serving at the front has been approved by the first Joint Session of Parliament.The Pacific.Besides the striking declaration of Mr. Cook, to which attention is invited above, the recommendations of the Australian Inter-State Commission deserve attention. The suggestion to establish a High Commissionership of the Pacific, with head-quarters at Sydney, and other possible developments, afford an important indication of Australian opinion.The statement of the Inter-State Commission that the New Hebrides Condominium is satisfactory neither to the British Empire nor to Prance, is worthy of notice. The references by the Commission to the jews Hebrides question generally require careful study.Germany in Africa.It is hoiked that the Appendix on the German need of African possessions, attached to this Report, will be found of value, especially if read in conjunction wdth Appendices to Western Reports Xos. 51, 53, 54 and 57 (Part I.), and 63 (Part 11..).G.

PART I. -BRITISH EMPIRE AND  AFRICA.CANADA.Budget Statement.&apos; -The Acting Minister of Finance (Mr. A. K. Maclean) presented the Dominion Budget to the House of Commons on April 30th, in the absence of Sir Thomas White. According to Press reports, Mr. Maclean stated that the revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31st was -$258,000,000, which was an increase of $26,000,000 over that of the preceding year. The total expenditure, apart from war expenses, amounted to $203,000,000, leaving a favourable balance of $55,000,000 to be applied to war expenditure. The war expenditure for the past year approxi-mated to $315,000,000, of which about half had been spent in the Dominion. The net debt of Canada was now about $1,200,000,000.Regarding trade, Mr. Maclean stated that the total trade of the Dominion had more than doubled since 1913, and that it was annually increasing. Exports, he said, exceeded imports during the past year by $625,000,000. While the exports to Great Britain amounted to $860,000,000, and the imports were only $81,000,000, the balance of trade against Canada with the United States was $350,000,000.Financial Arrangements witli United States. The Prime Minister (Sir Robert borden) has returned to Ottawa from New York, where he has been, on a mission connected with Dominion war finance. When in New York the Premier conferred with the Finance Minister&apos; (Sir Thomas White), who has been in consultation with Lord Reading and Mr. McAdoo at Washington. The Acting Minister of Finance (Mr. Maclean) has also been in New York, and in making his Budget statement (referred to above) he stated, according to Press reports, that during the past few months a high rate had prevailed on remittances from the United States, which imposed a severe tax on the public. He added that the Government were endeavouring to bring about financial arrangements with Great Britain and the United States which would materially relieve people of the burden of the present high rate of exchange. sDiversion of Shijiping. The War Cabinet have carefully reviewed the circum-stances leading up to the recent diversion of tonnage from Canada to the United States (vide Report No. 65), and the Secretary of State for the Colonies has conveyed to the Dominion Government the very great regret of the Cabinet that the Canadian Ministers should have been placed in the position of receiving through indirect channels information of the projected change, without any prior communication from the British Government. The War Cabinet, it is added, fully recognise that before changes are made affecting Dominion interests, the Canadian Government have the strongest claim to be consulted, and it is their intention that such consultation shall take place, apart from wholly exceptional cases of sudden emergency.War Appropriation Bill. The Dominion House of Commons has passed the third reading of the $500,000,000 War Appropriation Bill, and the measure has been sent to the Senate.Voluntary Enlistments and. Exemptions. The Minister of Justice (Mr. Doherty) has stated in Parliament that the voluntary enlistments in the Overseas Forces of the Dominion from the outbreak of the war to October 31st, 1917, totalled 139,807. The figures from the various Provinces are of interest, viz. : Ontario              -          -	-   191.632Quebec	-    18,931Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island -	-    23,436Noav Brunswick -	-     18,022Manitoba           ...          -	-    52,781Saskatchewan     -	.-    26,111Alberta	-    36,279British Columbia and the Yukon	-    42,609Total       -	-   439,8071 Further details -will be given in next \veek&apos;s Report.
As to the number of men who have reported for service under the Military Service .Act since it came into operation, the Minister of Justice has given the total as 24,567, distributed amongst the Provinces as follows : Ontario	-   7,823Nova Scotia           -             -	-   1,719Prince Edward Island	263Saskatchewan	-   2,4-22British Columbia	-   2,915Quebec	-    -   2,305New Brunswick	-i   o &apos;) QManitoba               -             -	-   2,509Alberta	-   3,199The Yukon	-       79The exemptions granted on account of medical unfitness totalled 118,722, and those given for other reasons amounted to 200,881. The total number of exemptions claimed throughout the Dominion is given as 373,184.Penalties for Idling. With reference to the Order-in-Council compelling all male persons between 16 and 60 who are domiciled in Canada to engage in some useful occupation (vide Report No. 63), several fines have already- been imposed by the Ontario Bolice Courts under the powers conferred to impose penalties upon those who remain in idleness when capable of performing useful work. The. Toronto Chief of Police has stated that certain persons &quot;whose names are in his possession will be prosecuted unless they obtain employment at once.Parliament and the United States Labour Representative. The President of the American Federation of Labour (Mr. Gompers) has addressed a Joint Sitting of the Dominion Senate and House of Commons and paid a striking tribute to canada&apos;s war efforts, both in industrial and military directions. He stated that the united States was anxious to emulate the Dominions splendid example.Enemy Sympathisers and Farming Operations. -It is reported that there has been a deliberate attempt on the part of enemy sympathisers to delay farming operations in Canada. An examination of a number of farm tractors ordered by the Government for use at Regina, has disclosed the fact that they have been tampered with.AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.Commonioealth Delegates to London; Nationalist Approval: Delegate?s Statement on the Pacific J The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy (Mr. Cook) explained the objects of the forthcoming visit to London to a recent meeting of the Nationalist Parliamentary Party in Melbourne. After hearing the addresses of the Ministers, a resolution was moved by Mr. J. A. Boyd to the effect that Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cook would go to represent Australia with the full approval of the Nationalists. This resolution was seconded by Mr. R. W. Foster and carried unanimously amid great enthusiasm.The Minister for the Navy declared in a speech delivered shortly before leaving Australia that if Germany could cany out her proclaimed programme and get the Pacific Colonies back, they would train the natives for defensive purposes and Australia would have to keep up a huge standing army. It.was treasonable, he said, for any person to advocate restoring the islands to Germany -while the enemy were thundering at their gates, and he would stand behind Mr. Hughes in London in urging the retention of the islands to the last gasp, as they were vital to Australia s security. For the rest, the delegates, Mr. Cook observed, would have open minds, believing that they could best serve Australia, hy trying to keep together the mighty British Empire in trust for the whole of civilised mankind.See also under &apos;&quot;&apos; The Pacific.&quot;
Mr. Hughes on Peace. The Prime Minister in a speech at the meeting which is - referred to above said : &quot; Let us send a message to the British Government,&apos; which is sorely beset with difficulties, and hearing a crushing load of responsibilities, that Australia is behind the Empire to-day. There is only one way to victory, and that is not the Bolshevists&apos; way. Let us fight like free men to the end. I am&apos; for peace, but the only way is by the destruction of the Hohenzollerns&apos; power and the power of military Germany.&quot;Shipping Arrangements with United States. Lord Reading has reported that he has been informed by the United States Secretary of State that a telegram has been received from the United States Consul at Melbourne to the effect that the Government, of the Commonwealth wish to establish a closer relationship with America in regard to shipping. For this reason, it is stated, the Commonwealth Government consider it highly important that a representative of their Shipping Board should go to the United States in order to co-operate with the Shipping Board of that country, and inquiry has been made as to whether this would be viewed with favour. In response to this suggestion the United States Shipping Board have intimated their wish to invite a Commonwealth representative to co-operate in the way suggested, provided the British Government offer no objection.Recruiting Conference and Enlistment Prospects. After consideration of the proposals put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) regarding the conditions upon which the Labour Party would co-operate in the recruiting effort, the official summary of the proceedings states that an agreement between the Parties was ultimately reached. The following are the terms of a resolution which was unanimously passed : &quot; That this Conference meeting at a time of unparalleled emergency, resolves to make all possible efforts to avert defeat at the hands of German militarism, and urges the people of Australia to join in a whole-hearted effort to secure the necessary reinforcements under the voluntary system.&quot;It is stated that there has been an increase in enlistments during the week ended the 20th instant as compared with the previous week. The increase in New South Wales, it is stated, was due largely to Captain Carmichaehs appeal. In Queensland the State Recruiting Committee have issued a recruiting appeal signed b3&apos; the Governor, the Labour Premier (Mr. Ryan), the Opposition Leader, and the heads of Churches.   It is addressed to members of all creeds and political parties.A return has been prepared by the Commonwealth Statistician (Mr. Ivnibbs) for the Ministry of Defence, showing the estimated number of eligible men between 19 and 44 who are available in each electorate, and also the annual epiota necessary to provide the recruits which General Griffiths has reported are necessary to maintain the strength of the Australian Imperial Forces. These estimates are in the hands of the recruiting authorities for use in connection with the Governments proposal for a voluntary ballot under the new recruiting scheme.A recruiting demonstration has been arranged for May 7th at Melbourne Town Ilall which (it is stated in the Press) will be attended by the Governor-General and Federal and State Ministers. Invitations to the meeting have been issued to Mr. Tudor and Archbishop Mannix.Purchase of Zinc Concentrates. Tbe Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has announced that a contract has been arranged wherebj- the British Government purchases practicaUy the whole of the Commonwealth&apos;s output of zinc concentrates for the period of the war and for 10 years afterwards. He points out that this is probably the largest sale of zinc ever made. Great Britain takes the stocks on hand in December, less a definite percentage reserved, and thereafter 250,000 tons annually during the war and* one year after, and 300,000 tons annually during the nine following years. Provision has been- made, Mr. Hughes states, for supplying adequately the requirements of Australian zinc refining works and also for fulfilling existing contracts wdth -Japan, and he adds that he regards the contract as most satisfactory to all who are concerned in seeing that the control of this base metal is secured by the British Empire.War Loan and Sanction of Lotteries. On the closing of the subscriptions to the War Loan, the full amount of 40,000,000L had been over-subscribed by more than three million pounds.   The number of subscribers totalled 111,391.
Protests have been made to the Commonwealth Treasurer (Mr. Watt) by religious,, educational and commercial organisations in Melbourne against the War Precaution Regulation sanctioning lotteries in connection with the War Loan. Mr. Watt replied that the Treasury was following the lead of Great Britain, and it was necessary to adopt new methods as it was essential that 40,000,000/.. should be obtained&apos; in Australia each six months. Otherwise, he said, the Commonwealth would be forced to coutinue making promises to Great Britain and borrowing the money of that country in order to meet bills. *&apos;It was shameful,&quot; Mr. Watt declared, &quot; that Great-Britain should have to provide 48,000,000Z. for the payment of Australian soldiers.&quot; At the same time, he added, he had uo desire to wound susceptibilities, and unless the lottery scheme proved extremely satisfactory, it was unlikely that permission would be granted in the future.Sinn Fein Movements. A petition containing 83,500 signatures has been presented to the House of Representatives praying that Sinn Fein may be declared an unlawful organisation, and that &quot; Archbishop Mannix and his disloyal followers &quot; may be dealt with.Home Defence. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) has announced in the Senate that the Government proposed to strengthen the Defence position of Australia by extending home training and enlisting men between the ages of 21 and 50 who were unfit for service abroad. He stated that no one knew what might come out of the war, and that it might yet be necessary to fight in defence of Australia.Sir W. Irvine as Lieutenanl-Govemor. The Chief Justice of Victoria (Sir William Irvine) has been appointed Lieutenaut-Governor of Victoria. The latter position was also held by the previous Chief Justice, the late Sir John Madden.Queensland Labour. The Labour Caucus of the State of Queensland have re-elected the Premier (Mr. Ryan) and all the Ministers. The portfolios of the members of the Ministry are being arranged.NEW ZEALAND.Life of Parliament. The life of the Parliament of the Dominion has been prolonged for a year.Finance. The Government proposals for raising loans and other war measures were considered during the recent short Session of Parliament. The Finance Bill was passed-thro ugh its final stages on April I5th (according- to a Press cable). This authorises the raising of a new loan of 20,000,000^, and penalises persons who are in a position to subscribe but who fail to do so by compelling them to subscribe at a lower rate of interest.Shipping of Oil from United States. As the United States Shipping Controller will not grant charters to sailing vessels to proceed to the Dominion without an assurance being given that the return cargo will comprise wheat or wool, the Dominion Government have called the attention of the British authorities to the fact that there is no wheat available for export and the woolclip has been purchased by the British Government, and therefore that the stipulation cannot be complied, with. The Dominion Ministers ask that the British authorities shall endeavour to arrange with the United States that the ships should take as their return cargoes tallow, pelts, and hemp, of which there are considerable amounts available. This arrangement, it is pointed out, would greatly ease the financial position in New Zealand.SOUTH AFRICA.Imperial War Cabinet and, Conference : Representation of South Africa. The Secretary of State for the Colonies has telegraphed to the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa that he has discussed with his colleagues the question of56S1    Li B
General Botha&apos;s attendance at the forthcoming Conference in London, and that they fully share the view that, while profoundly regretting his absence, they recognise the absolute necessity, in existing circumstances, for bis presence in South Africa.The Prime Minister announced in the House of Assembly on April 30th, according to a Press telegram, that the Union Minister of Railways, Mr. Burton, woidd proceed to London, where General Smuts and he would represent South Africa.Nationalist Campaign. Reports from the Union show that the strong attitude adopted by the Government has had a very steadying effect upon the situation which, arose from the Republican propaganda campaign of the Nationalists. The Dutch churches are stated to be working in the direction of peace, and in favour of the avoidance of internal strife. The Leader of the Nationalists (General Hertzog), in telegraphing to his constituents at Smithfield regarding a meeting to be held there on May 5th, has asked the people &quot; to let nothing disturb peace in the Free State Province.&quot; In a speech in the Cape Province, General Hertzog denied that he ever advocated attaining any object by force of arms. They had obtained most of their rights on peacefuf constitutional lines, and he said he was convinced to-day that. they would get their rights in the same way. General Hertzog declared that his policy of &quot; South Africa first&quot; was called sedition, and that the policy of the Government was the Empire first. He asked by what right Ministers allowed themselves to be called on as agents of the Empire to buy wool. The Empire, he said, was only good in so far as it was good for South Africa.Joint Session and Soldiers&apos; Votes. The first Joint Session of the Senate and House of Representatives, which was held to discuss the Bill amending the franchise to enable overseas members of the South African contingent to record their votes outside the Union, passed all stages on April 24th without one dissentient voice. One hundred and forty-two out of the one hundred and seventy members recorded their votes, thus giving the necessary two-thirds majority required by the Constitution. Though there have been previous amendments of the South African Constitution, the above occasion Avas the first which necessitated a Joint Session of the tAvo Houses.Glycerine Production. With reference to the views of the Union Ministers concerning glycerine production (vide Report No. 01), the Minister of Munitions has intimated that he could not recommend British assistance in the Avay suggested, as the provision of further tonnage would be im^olA^ed and the shortage in this direction has been the main cause of the difficulty in obtaining glycerine&apos; in the United Kingdom. The British authorities hope to secure adequate supplies by a method which will enable talloAv to be brought from Australia, and New Zealand and cocoanut oil from Ceylon. The question of increasing the selling price of glycerine is still being considered.LIBERIA.Admiralty Protection-With reference to the bombardment, of Monrovia (vide Report No. 6-1), the British Government have informed the Liberian Government that the absence of harbours prevents the maintenance of a British ship in Liberian waters, but that the Admiralty have arranged to assist Liberia in the event of a further submarine attack being made.THE PACIFIC.1Suggestions for High Commissionersliip and Federation. The Australian Com-commonwealth Inter-State Commission (which was a body provided for under the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act for dealing with matters of trade and commerce, and which was actually brought info existence in December 1912) has made an important report to the Commonwealth House of Representatives upon1 See also under &quot; Australian Common wealth.&apos;&apos;
* ;   93-British and Australian trade in the South Pacific. In this report-it is stated that the-question is ripe for settlement as fq. whether some form of federated control could he devised involving a High . Commissionership, of the Pacific, held or not held in conjunction with the Governor-Generalship of the. Commonwealth, Australia would be-the suitable kernel from which a. Federation would naturally grow. In this case federated control, it is submitted, should&apos;have Sydney as the central seat with powers of supervision and co-ordination which are not now possessed by any controlling Governments. The Commission recommended a conjoint inquiry into the matter by representatives of the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.New Hebrides Condominium. The Australian Inter-State Commission has also-directed attention to the necessity for a better international arrangement in regard to the New Hebrides, as it is pointed out. the present one is not satisfactory either to the British or the French. The Commission states that it is necessary to devise measures to arrest the decrease of the native population, to train the natives and-to teach them English. It is pointed out that the absence of uniformity in land policy lias rendered pioneer work difficult. The Commission further report that they are satisfied that it is impossible to develop trade in order to compete with foreign countries without considerable subsidies,- and they point out that the Commonwealth could, with considerable commercial advantage, afford to allow most of the Pacific productions to enter Australia free of duty.      . - .  - .
APPENDIXTOWestern and General Report No. 66.  Part I.GERMAN NEED  OF AFRICAN POSSESSIONSThe German views upon their need of possessions in Africa has been dealt with recently, both from the economic and military aspects, by some authoritative writers in Germany. The extracts which are given below represent the views of certain writers who are associated with the official elements in the country.ECONOMIC ASPECTS.Obtaining Raio Materials. The General Manager of the German Iron Trade Company (Leo Lustig), in the course of an article in the Bdrsen Zeitung of 20th March last states : &quot; The longer the war lasts, the more occupied do our minds become with thoughts as to the future of our export trade ; for the question of obtaining raw materials, which is important primarily for industry, is at the same time the problem of our future status on the world market. Though &apos; our experiment as &apos; a self-sufficing State &apos; may have proved successful under the stress of blockade, yet, for all that, a trade in raw materials and goods which in the last years of peace amounted to about 10 milliards of marks in import and export, was the main source of our ever increasing prosperity. We shall be the less able to dispense with this interchange of commodities after the war, seeing that the prolonged duration of the war has used up our last reserves.&quot;Colonies the Main Asset. In order to meet the above difficulty, herr Lustig -writes as follows : &quot; If we face these facts, we cannot avoid the conclusion that our Colonies, in spite of the present English blockade, are one of our main assets. In many respects the war has been a good teacher ; it has, for one thing, taught us to appreciate more fulty the value of our colonial possessions.&quot;Though the writer acknowledges that the German importation of raw materials in 1912 amounted to about 5 milliards of marks, as against a total importation from the Colonies of about 52 millions, and in the same year German exports in finished goods amounted to 6 milliards, and the total exports to the Colonies to only -19 millions, he points out that &quot; it must not be forgotten that the requirements of the Mother Country increased from (5 to 53 millions between the years 1890 and 1913, that is to say, nearly tenfold.&quot; He then proceeds : &quot; The fact, however, remains that our total imports of raw materials represented about 90 times the value of our imports from our own Colonies. Those who are wont to emphasise the permanent reasons why we should have Colonies of our own will be disposed to draw from this the conclusion that it behoves us, therefore, to aim at a methodical extension and roundfng-off of such colonial areas as we have hitherto possessed.&quot; He continues : &quot; Besides these permanent reasons, which are frequently and convincingly adduced by experts, there are, however, I think, others of a temporary nature which, in the interests of our large-scale trade, will make it imperative for us, when peace terms are being discussed, to insist on the restoration of our colonial possessions.&quot;After-War Difficulties, In.connection with the above, herr Lustig refers to the prejudice likely to exist against the German trader after the war, and remarks : &quot; It is,&apos; at any rate, a fact that the Allied Powers have succeeded during the war in wrecking
practically all the work which Germans had industriously built up overseas. Further-more, it is a fact that English influence has succeeded in spreading an atmosphere of hatred against Germans throughout the whole world ; at present we are inclined to disregard this, but our commercial advance guard wdl find it very noticeable as soonas they try and restart business intercourse.....   In this state of affairs, german colonies in future will gain a special importance as &apos; -points cVappui &apos;; they will become bases of operation for overseas, trade, from which it will be possible to get into direct touch with other overseas areas of supply for raw materials. Thus, their re-acquisition will be as great a success from a practical as from a moral point of view, and by this means the Entente plans of an economic war will be frustrated.&quot;British Preferential Trade. Dealing with the possibility of a British scheme for an Empire Customs Union, Herr Lustig emphasises the danger to Germanv as follows : &quot;Should England, for example, enter into closer economic relations with her Colonies, of which there are already many signs, in order to increase the price of raw materials that are most essential for Germany then the possession of Colonies will simply be a question of life or death for us.&quot; It is interesting to note that the writer emphasises a point which has previously been noted by authorities in this country, viz., that the first economic agreement Germain-has concluded during the war- the treaty with the Ukraine &quot; has stipulated with much foresight for the possibility of a tariff in favour of her Colonies.&quot;-   . MILITARY ASPECTS.- The Militarisation of the Natives. With regard to the attempts of Dr. Solf, the -German Colonial Secretaiy, to deal with the militarisation of Africa from the point of view of maintaining a military- balance of power &quot; (vide Appendix to Report No. 51), herr Friedrich Hupfeld, Director of the German Togo Company, has dealt with the subject in the munich Neueste Nacliriehten in the following words : &quot; No agreement of international law, no court of international arbitration, no declarations, however solemn, will prevent France and England from proceeding with the militarisa-tion of the natives, if that offers them the prospect of overthrowing- their enemy in a -future war. There is only one effective remedy ; the world-war must effect such a division of colonial territory in Africa that there will be an approximate military balance of power between both groups of Powers. Then perhaps both will be reasonable enough to renounce a competition of armaments in Africa at least.&quot;The writer argues that the most effective way of preventing France from recruiting natives is that the territory should be acquired by Germany, apparently7 for the same purpose. This is indicated by7 the following words : &quot; The recruiting of blacks for France must be made impossible by7 Germany7 acquiring, at one or more points,isi the extensive territory7 which has hitherto been predominantly7 French, and which -stretches from Dahomey7 over the Niger to Senegal and northward to Morocco, Algiers, -and Tunis. These acquisitions, together with the German Colony of Togo, will create a military equilibrium in this area also.&quot;Gape to Cairo and the danger to Germany. Apart from the question of the militarisation of the natives, which Herr Hupfeld considers will necessitate a considerable increase of German colonial territory, he comments upon the necessity7 of increased territory7 from the point of view of British domination of Africa through the-development of the Cape to Cairo system. He writes: &quot;We must prevent a superiority7 of English power, and we must not allow British South Africa, and the English possessions in the North-East of Africa to be joined together. The achieve-ment of the English ideal of a through route from the Cape to Cairo would enable England at any time to roll up from the interior all the foreign colonies lying to the left and the right of this railway7, -while the English Fleet would make a simultaneous attack from the sea. The only way to prevent this is bjT demanding German possessions which will stretch right through from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic.&quot;Portuguese Colonies. Not content with the French possessions which the above quoted writer allocates to Germany7, Dr. Hans Meyer, Professor of Colonial Geograply at the University7 of Leipzig, in his recently7 published work entitled &quot; The Portuguese Colonial Empire of To-day7,&quot; demands that Germany7 should make a peace condition of seizing the African Colonies of Portugal in order to develop the scheme of the
IkCentral African Empire. He writes : &quot; Germany&apos;s greatest colonial peace aim mast Ije the construction of a united Central Africa, resting on the four pillars of Togo, the Cameroons, East Africa, and South-West Africa, stretching from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean, and taking in the intermediate territory of our enemies, especially the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, Portuguese Angola, and&quot; the northern half of Mozambique, thus forming with pur old colonies a solid continental block.&quot;Apparently, Dr. Meyer would hope to seize the Portuguese territory in any case, but he admits that the acquisition of French and British territory depends upon the success of the German Armies, for he says,: &quot; How far the French colonies in West Africa, and British territory in East, and West Africa, should be included will depend on the farther course of the war.&quot;Naval Stations and Fortified Harbours. Professer Meyer sees the value of Central Africa from the naval and military point of view as a means of establishing the world-political aims of the German Empire. Though admitting that opposition to his project must be expected from England, Francs and America, as well as Portugal, he writes : &quot; German Central Africa could not exist without a strong chain of naval stations and fortified harbours connecting it securely with the Homeland. No other chain so good could be found along the Atlantic as the Portuguese possessions of St. Thomas, Portuguese Guinea, Madeira, and the Azores. These would afford extraordinarily important outposts for controlling world traffic through the Straits of Gibraltar and between America, Southern Europe, and Southern Africa.&quot;H. d&apos;K
