SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 57.PART I,-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Canada.The high percentage of votes recorded by the soldiers in favour of the Union Government is a striking manifestation of the confidence of the men at the front in the vigorous war policy of Sir R. BordeiTs administration.The creation of a new Department of State to deal with the rehabilitation of returned soldiers is interesting, and the Minister at the head of this Department will apparently be charged with much the same class of duties as the Minister for Repatriation in Australia.In the action taken by the Union Cabinet to inform themselves as to the special interests of women in the Dominion, the same thoroughness of method has been adopted as in the recent conferences between the Government and Labour representatives.Australian Commonwealth.The naval construction which is under contemplation in the Commonwealth is in keeping with the Australian policy of developing local effort in this direction.. The telegram from the Commonwealth Government regarding the wheat position is important. As pointed out by the Australian Ministers, this matter is one of considerable significance in its relation to the development of the country. The subject is receiving serious consideration by the War Cabinet.The steps that are being taken in Queensland and Victoria for the settlement of returned soldiers are worth noting.South Africa.The observations of the Minister of Railways regarding the freedom of the country from the acute effects of the war are of interest.Germany and Africa.The redistribution of Africa as now proposed by Dr. Solf is obviously designed to thrust the Allied nations from any position of influence in tropical Africa.The Resolution of the French Socialists as to the legitimate position of germany
in Africa can hardly he based upon any knowledge of German methods either in the economic or administrative spheres.The summary given in the Appendix of German methods in South-West Africa, and of the views of representative natives regarding their continuance under British rule, merits consideration in this connection.It is to be noted that the Socialist Conference in London has put forward a recommendation for the control of tropical Africa by international agreement. This recommendation involves maintaining the sovereignty of the nations, in place of the international administration previously suggested by the British Labour Party.The views of Monsieur Penkin upon the internationalisation policy should receive careful attention.G G  A-February 28th, 1918.

PART   I.   BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Control of Foreign Shipping. --The Dominion Governments have been consulted as to arrangements for the more effective control of foreign shipping engaged in trade outside the war zone. It is proposed to co-operate with the United States in this regard and to prevent the ships referred to loading in British or American ports unless they, are chartered to representatives of British or American shipping authorities, and also to prevent such ships loading on berth unless the cargo is approved. Besides being asked as to the manner in which they would be prepared to co-operate, the Dominion Governments are asked whether priority lists for essential imports could be furnished by importing countries in respect of certain trades.CANADA.Imperial War Cabinet. The Prime Minister has informed the British Government that he will not be able to leave the Dominion for the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet until the end of the Parliamentary Session, which he hopes will be about the middle of Maj^. Sir Robert Borden states that only urgent public affairs or illness would prevent his then leaving for England. He announces that at least two of his colleagues will accompany him, whose names will be communicated later.Soldiers&apos; Votes in Dominion Elections. The official result of the Canadian soldiers&apos; and sailors&apos; votes that were cast in France, Canada, and the United States at the General Election has now been declared. This shows that eight of the seats previously given to the Opposition are transferred to the Government, who conse-quently now possess a majority of 60 in the House of Commons, even before the votes of the soldiers wffiich were cast in the United Kingdom are counted. The vote of the soidiers at the front in France indicates that the Union Government received 92 &quot;&quot;89 per cent, of the accepted votes, while nearly 80 per cent, of the soldiers&apos; vote in Canada was in favour of the Unionists.The present position regarding the return of candidates in the various Provinces is as follows : 	Govt,	Opposn.Prince Edward Island -	-     0	4Nova Scotia    -	-   .12	4Newr Brunswdck	7	4Quebec         -           -           -	0 .J	62Ontario        -	-   -            -   72	10Manitoba	-   13	1Saskatchewan	-   16	,  oAlberta           -	-   .11	british Columbia	-   13	0The Yukon     -	-    0	1	147	87In the Province of Quebec a considerable number of the votes cast by soldiers were rejected because no Government candidates had been officially put forward by the Unionists. As to the French-Canadian Ministers who were defeated Colonel Bloncbn received 720 soldiers&apos; votes, but still needs 1,600 to obtain a victory; while Mr. Sevigny obtained 771 soldiers&apos; votes, leaving the majority now against him at 1,500. The result of the soldiers&apos;vote in the United Kingdom will be announced .in about a week&apos;s time. It is contemplated that these votes will further affect the result in favour of the Union Government. .
Minister for Overseas Military Forces. Sir Edward Kemp, the Minister for -Overseas Military Forces, obtained a total vote in Toronto East in the recent election of 14,354, which included 11,813 civilian votes, 625 from the soldiers in North America, and 1,916 from soldiers in France.New Department for Returned Soldiers. The Dominion Government have issued an Order-in-Council creating a new Government Department to be known as the Department of Soldiers Civil Re-establishment, to the portfolio of which they have -appointed Senator Sir James Lougheed, who hitherto has been a Minister without portfolio and Chairman of the Military Hospitals Commission. The Under Secretary of this new Department will be Mr. F. B MeCurdy, whc is being transferred from his position as Under Secretary of the Department of Militia. The Government decided to create this new Department on account of the growing work in connection with the rehabilitation of returned soldiers. The Military Hospitals Commission and Tensions Board are being placed under the new Department.It is to be noted that the Chairman of the Soldiers&apos; Aid Commission iii the province, of Ontario states that there are now over 15,000 returned soldiers in. that province.Military Service Convention.- it is estimated that under the Convention recently concluded with the United States, 60,000 Canadians in that country will be affected&apos;, .ancl 36,000 citizens of the United States who are resident in Canada,Numbers joining tinder,Military Service Act. Up to noon on February 19th the number of men reporting under the Military Service Act amounted to 21,978.. The number who should have reported is a little over i?5,00U, thus showing that there are over 3,000 men who have either failed to respond, and have not been apprehended, or whose cases remain to be investigated.Re-organisation of the Dominion Forces. The Canadian Minister of Overseas Military Forces has announced that as a result of a conference which has been held with the senior officers in France and England, the Canadian Army at the front will be appreciably strengthened. Proposals td give effect to this are now before the British Secretary of State for War.Women and, the Government. In pursuance of the policy adopted by the Dominion Government in relation to labour interests, it has been decided hy the Dominion War Cabinet to obtain full information with regard to the special interests of women in the Dominion. On February 28th-a delegation of about 50 women, representing every sphere of women&apos;s activity in. Canada, will meet the Cabinet, and confidential informa-tion will l)e placed before the delegates relating to the actual condition of affairs, and suggestions will be invited from them as to the policy of the Government. This will be the first occasion upon which women have been formally invited to meet the Dominion Government in conference.Steel. Production. The Dominion Government have pointed out to the British authorities that steel production in Canada is seriously hampered on account of the lack of low-phosphorus pig iron. As the Dominion Ministers understand that the British Government are negotiating with Sweden regarding this iron, they have asked whether the Dominion could secure a supply from that country, and if so, the cpiantity that would be available.NEWFOUNDLAND.Imperial War Cabinet.-Tlie Prime Minister (Dr. W. F. Lloyd) has informed the British Government that he hopes to attend the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet and that the time fixed for the Session will be convenient to&quot; him.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Imperial War Cabinct.--It has now been announced in Australia that the Minister for the Navy (Mr. Cook) wiil accompany Mr. Hughes to England in connection with the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet, It is anticipated that the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Watt) will be acting Prime Minister during the absence of Mr. Hughes.
Naval Shipbuilding. The Commonwealth Government are contemplating building at Cockatoo Island Naval Dockyard one light cruiser and two destroyers of about 1,000 tons and two submarines. They have asked the Admiralty to recommend the best &quot;types,, and also whether it is possible to forward plans and materials.Mr. Hughes on Peace Terms:-Referring to the peace offered to Russia by the Central Powers, the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) stated in a recent speech at Sydney that &quot; the peace-offered to Russia was that of a ravening tiger. If an offer of such &quot;terms was made to a great nation like Russia, what would the enemy offer to &quot; Australia ? The Allies wanted munitions, ships, and foodstuffs. Australians could &quot; all do something, and must all do something. There were pacifists about babbling-&quot; of peace.   Steps would be taken to silence these voices.&quot;Recruiting in the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister has. announced that the Government intend to appoint a High Court Judge as a commissioner to decide how many recruits are required monthly in the Commonwealth. It is understood that the new recruiting scheme will be in charge of a Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Defence, who will review the existing recruiting organisation. Cards will be distributed to men between the ages of 19 and 44 asking whether they will submit their names to a ballot in order to make up the quota for any particular month.Defence Administration. The Royal Commission which has been enquiring..into the Defence administration of the Commonwealth has reported that the present methods are incompatible with efficiency and economy, and has recommended the establishment of a Business Board, consisting of three business men, a District Business Board in each district, the appointment of an Administrative Inspector-General, and the formation of an Ordnance Corps. All the above-mentioned recommendations have been adopted by the Federal Cabinet.Sixth Bar Loan. The prospectus of the sixth Australian War Loan has been issued, the subscriptions to which will be closed on the 10th April. The Loan will be issued at par on an alternative interest basis, viz., 4-J- per cent, free of taxation, and 5 per cent, subject to Commonwealth, but free of State, Income Tax. The Loan is repayable at par on December 15th, 1927.Wheat Crop. The Commonwealth Government have called the attention of the British Government to the serious position arising from the inability to dispose of primary products. They point out that the Government have advanced 25 millions in respect of the season&apos;s wheat crop, and have guaranteed a similar amount for next season on a basis of 4s. f.o.b. The farmers are urging that there should be a further guarantee on a similar basis for the 1920 crop, and unless this is arranged, they will turn their attention to the production of wool and meat. The result would only mean an increased number of owners of stock and a decreased production of aggregate wealth, with a tendency to drive men into the cities and to retard the development of Australia. The Commonwealth Government, therefore, ask whether the British Government will purchase the whole or part of the season&apos;s wheat crop (vide Report No. 54). The question of Australian wheat is now under the consideration of the British War Cabinet.Settlement of Returned Soldiers. The Premier of Queensland, in his pre-election speech on policy, stated that over 34 million acres of land had been reserved for group settlement of returned soldiers, this being estimated as capable of accommodating 16,000 men. In 10 other centres the Premier stated that 48,641 acres had been set apart to accommodate the returned sons of farmers and other volunteers from those districts.The Victorian Minister for Lands has announced that 400 returned soldiers have been provided with land purchased from private owners, and that 150 others have been settled on Crown lands.New South Wales and the Empire. The New South Wales House of Assembly has passed a resolution unanimously expressing the fervent loyalty of the people of New South Wales towards the King, and affirming their unalterable attachment to the laws and institutions of the British Empire.The premier&apos;s motion in the New South AVales Legislative Assembly congratulate-. latin g the new Governor on his accession to office was carried by 32 votes to 11-
Members of the Labour Opposition protested against the motion and contended that -the office of State Governor should be abolished.Internment of Germans from China. The . Commonwealth Government have agreed to accommodate the German subjects now in China in accordance with the suggestion of the British Government (vide Report No. 55), and have intimated that Sydney is the most convenient port of disembarkation, though it is possible that some should be disembarked at Melbourne. While agreeing that the Chinese Consul-Gen oral should be allowed free access to the camps, the Commonwealth Government consider it undesirable that a Chinese Commissioner should exercise any control in the administration of the camps, more especially as some of the persons accommodated in these camps would be persons interned from Australia and elsewhere.Wool for United Stales. Regarding the allocation of 200,000 bales of merino wool to the United States, the Commonwealth Government have been informed that the United States Government iind it difficult to use this wool entirely for military purposes, and they wish to commandeer in ore local wool for use in this direction, and to utilise part of the Australian wool for civil purposes. . They further wish to purchase 150,000 bales of wool, preferably crossbred.In order to meet the above requirements, the British Government suggest to the Commonwealth that the United States should have unrestricted use of the 200,000 bales already purchased, and as crossbred wool cannot be furnished from the United Kingdom, it is proposed to supply a further 150,000 bales of merino wool. The tonnage would be provided by the United States, and the terms should allow a considerable profit, which would be shared- by the Commonwealth. It is suggested that the proposed arrangements should have the effect of further reducing the accumulation of stocks in Australia which cannot be shipped to the United Kingdom.The concurrence of the Commonwealth Ministers is sought to the proposals outlined above.Production of Glycerine. In reply to the telegram from the British Government (vide Report No. 53, under &quot; Imperial Affairs &quot;) the Commonwealth Government have stated that thej&apos; are prepared to take charge of the production of glycerine, and further reduce the consumption by prohibiting its use in relation to foodstuffs and tobacco. It is anticipated that objection will be raised locally to this course owing to the abundance of tallow available in Australia for the manufacture of glycerine, and it is suggested that the British Government should take over the total stocks and output of Commonwealth tallow at a price fixed by appraisement. A scheme is submitted for the consideration of the British Government.NEW ZEALAND.Trade Commissioner and Samoa. The Trade Commissioner recently appointed in New Zealand by the Board of Trade has arranged to visit Samoa and other islands in the Pacific on his way out to the Dominion.Wool from Australasia.--The Dominion Government have been informed that it has been found impossible to meet the essential military requirements of the United Kingdom and Allied countries in regard to crossbred avooI from Australasia alone, and it is necessary to secure additional supplies from shorter distances. It is there-fore proposed to obtain 20,000 tons of Argentine crossbred wool from the United States, who would receive in exchange an equal weight of Australasian wool for their -own requirements. This arrangement would facilitate shipping, and the Dominion Ministers have been asked if they agree to it.1SOUTH AFRICA.liaihcays and Trade. In introducing the Railway Budget into the House of Assembly, the Minister of Railways and Harbours (Mr. Burton) stated that the deficit1 A similar telegram has been sent to the Commonwealth of Australia. 49S5 la S
for the year 1917-18 was! estimated at 218,000Z. instead of more than double that amount, which was originally estimated. He considered that in view of the extent to which the worhTs trade had been affected, the general trade of South Africa had continued surprisingly good. He observed that the people of South Africa had not sufficiently appreciated the remarkable freedom of the country from the acute effects of the war. He estimated the deficit on the revenue of the railways for the year 1918-19 at 968,000/,, to meet which-he foreshadowed an increase in railway rates.South-WesL Protect orate and South Africa&apos;&apos;s Debt. In referring to the increase which brought South Africans debt to 160 millions, Sir Edgar Walton in the House of Assembly said that the country had to set against this the acquisition of the South-West Protectorate. Speaking, he said, for himself and also for the Opposition in Parliament, he declared that he could not conceive that the work they were doing in the Protectorate could ever be undone by the act of any person or body.Coal Position. The Ministry of Shipping in a Report to the War Cabinet dated 23rd February, stated that the coal position in South Africa had received another setback owing to the railways between the Natal collieries and Durban being washed out. In consequence it is reported that it will not be possible to continue the shipment of considerable quantities of coal from South Africa to the Plate in order to bunker British and Allied ships there.GERMAN EAST AFRICA.Progress of Military Forces. General Northey reported on the 20th February that the enemy&apos;s main body appeared to have retired towards the coast out of his reach, and that they would have to be dealt with by forces from Port Amelia. He announced that the flooded state of the Zambesi river and damage from storms was causing great anxiety to him in connection with his lines of communication. . The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported- to the War Cabinet on the 22ndFebruary that General von Lettow had fallen back into Portuguese territory, where the country was unknown, and that he thought it possible that the enemy forces might now be starved out.GERMAN COLONIES IN AFRICA.Dr. Solf on German Colonial Policy. In a lecture before the German Colonial Society, Dr. Solf (the German Colonial Secretary) has stated that the war aims of Germany include the return of her colonies. He declared that colonial possessions should be redistributed on the basis of physical strength, economical needs and productive capacity of the various States, and that it appeared from the excessive colonial possessions of France, Portugal and Belgium there was at present no adequate proportional division. This, he stated, - must be provided for at the conclusion of peace.French Socialists and Return of Colonies. At a recent meeting of the National Socialist Council of France which considered the international action to be discussed at the London Conference, a Resolution was carried by a large majority to the effect that the return of colonies to those who had them before the war, or exchanges or compensations to be effected, must not be obstacles to the conclusion of peace, and that the colonies taken from Germany must be dealt with so that no territorial change wdll deprive Germany of the legitimate means of obtaining raw material, disposing of her own products, and having a legitimate share of economic development.1Socialist Conference and International Control. It is to be noted in connection with the preceding paragraph that in the &quot; Memorandum on War Aims &quot; adopted by the inter-Allied Labour and Socialist Conference in London last week, a declaration was approved in favour of a system of control of tropical Africa by international agreement under the League of Nations, which, whilst respecting national sovereignty, would be1 See also, under &quot;Peace Discussions,&quot; Part II.
alike inspired by broad conceptions of economic freedom and concerned to safeguard the rights of tbe natives.[ft is to be observed that this statement differs from the proposal for the interna-tional administration of tropical Africa as a single independent African State, which appeared in the proposals put forward by the British Labour Party on December 28th last. ]Belgian View of Jmernationali sation. The Belgian Colonial Secretary (M. Renkin) has made the following important declaration upon the proposal to internationalise tropical Africa : &apos;-&apos; There had been raised recently the question of the internationali-&quot; sation of the basin of the Congo, or, in default of complete internationalisation, of an &quot; international control for the protection of the natives. These ideas, though perhaps &quot; very generous, are impracticable, contrary to the notion of sovereignty, and incom-&quot; patible with justice. No Government could, without agreeing to abandon its position &quot; of authority, submit to control by others, and while seeing clearly that such a system &quot; would be without serious consequences to the strong nations but dangerous to those &quot; of us who are weak, we fail to discern what guarantee an international commission &quot;can offer us which is not more freely and effectively offered by the responsible &quot; Governments of the Entente nations.&quot;Professor Dove and General Smuts. Professor Dove has replied to the speech recently delivered by General Smuts, in the course of which he states that a great mistake is made&apos;in describing Germany&apos;s African colonies as half-way stations to India and Eastern Asia, and urging that General Smuts obviously said this for agitation purposes, as everybody must know that East Africa is not an Etappe station on the way to India. As to the militarisation of natives, he says British colonists disgrace themselves by talking such nousense, seeing that, froin the commencement of the war, the Entente has had hundreds of thousands of coloitred men under arms.
APPENDIXTOWestern and General Report No. 57.  Part I.THE SOUTH WEST AFRICA PROTECTORATE. THE NATIVES AND GERMAN RULE.The Administrator of the South-West Africa Protectorate has been recently engaged in collecting evidence both as to the past treatment by the Germans of the natives of the territory and as to the desires of the natives in regard to their future Government. A Report has been prepared embodying the results of these investigations, which is now on its way to England, but meantime the Union Government of South Africa have telegraphed a summary of some of the principal points of the Report for the information of the British Government.The Report is stated to establish the two following propositions :-(1) That the Germans, in South-West Africa have shown themselves to be totally unfitted for the responsibility of governing the native races of that territory.(2) That the return of the country to the.Germans would be regarded by every native tribe in South-West Africa as the greatest disaster in their tribal history.GERMAN RULE.The evidence in - the Report, it is stated, is drawn from the &apos; judicial and administrative records of the German authorities found at Wmdh.uk, from statements of Europeans and natives, and from the writings of Von Leutwein, Rohrbach, Dove, and other German authorities. The history of the principal native tribes during 25 years of German rule is reported to be an unbroken record of official bad faith and aggression and of private oppression and cruelty culminating in the Herero and Hottentot rebellions of 1901 to .1.907.German Treatment, of Natices. The Administrator points out that the German Government, in spite of agreements to the contrary, deprived the natives of most of their best land, while settlers appropriated their cattle. They were thus reduced almost to a state of slavery, and the ensuing rebellions were suppressed with ruthless cruelty.[In explanation of the above it should be stated that Colonel von Leutwein went out to South-West Africa in 1S94 as Civil and Military Governor. Some risings took place very soon after his arrival, and an indication of the methods adopted by the Germans in the suppression of the Khaus Hottentot rebellion of 1896 is afforded by the following quotation from a letter of Von Leutwein1 : &quot; The two leaders were shot &quot; by court-martial; the whole tribe was gradually annihilated and deprived of 12,000 &quot;&quot; head of cattle. A. few of the tribe who fled are still alive. The tribe as such has &quot;disappeared.&quot;The immediate cause of the Herero rebellion some years later was no doubt the German treatment of the land question combined with the unfair administration of justice and the bad treatment of the natives by the settlers involving them in the deprivation of their cattle.As regards the land, several private companies were formed with a large nominal but small Working capital, and the control by the companies of a large portion of the best pastoral lands, and the driving of the natives into &quot;reserves&quot; caused a great deal of native unrest.    Von Leutwein quotes a protest addressed to him by theliKSo t/i.1 See Die Herero, by Pastor Irle.O
Here r os of Gobabis as follows : &quot;We witness with terror our lands passing one after &quot; another into the hands of the whites, and consequently we humbly uray the &quot; Governor not to ratify any sale of land here and to transform all land not vet sold &quot; into a great reserve.&quot;The German settlers&apos; view of their position as colonisers in relation to the natives-is well illustrated by the following passage1 : &quot; It is only just and strictly conforms &quot; to the aims of colonisation in this territory that all land should pass from the &quot;natives to the whites. The country must be inhabited by white colonists. &quot; Consequently the natives ought to efface themselves and put themselves at the-&quot; service of the whites or retire into the reserves that should be allotted to them.&quot;As to the administration of the law-, the following table given in von Leutwein&apos;s-Elf JalireGouverneur shows the difference between the treatment of natives and whites under the German legal system : Murders of Whites by Natives.

This said: &quot;The Herero nation must &quot; now leave the country. If the people do it not, I will compel them with the big &quot; tube. Within the German frontier every Herero, with or without a rifle, with or &quot; without cattle, will be shot. I will not take over any more women or children, but &quot; I will either drive them back to your people, or have them fired on. These are my &quot; words to the nation of the Herero. The great General of the Mighty Emperor, von &quot; Trotha.&quot; -     &apos;As stated in the Memorandum quoted above, &quot; the ruthless war of extermination &quot; started by barbarities on the part of the Germans equally, if not entirely surpassing, the &quot; worst atrocities of the natives, was carried out until ouly a miserable remnant of the &quot; Hereros remained. Every conrpetent authority is in agreement as to the unnecessary &quot; slaughter that occurred.&quot;]German Policy of Annihilation, and Forced Labour. In referring to the numbers of natives who perished in the rebellions, the Report- of the Administrator of South-West Africa gives the numbers of the three principal tribes according to the lowest German estimates in 1904, and compares them to 1911 as follows : 1904. 1911.Hereros      - - - -   S0,000 15,100Hottentots     - - - -   20,000 9,800Berg Demaras - - -   30,000 12,000[The estimates as to the number killed in the Herero War are by no means identical. It is stated that in the first big battle on the 11th 12th August 1904- at Waterberg, the number of the Hereros present was 50,000, Avhile the Germans were under 2,000. The Germans lost during the three years&apos; Avar somewhere about 800 killed, and about a similar number Avere wounded; whereas there were probably only about 20,0001 Quoted by Yon Lentwein from an article in the Deutsche sud-westctfricanische Zeitunc/. - See &quot; Memorandum on the Administration of the German Colonies, with special Reference to the Treatment, of &quot;Natives.&quot;
THE NATIVES AND FUTURE GOVERNMENT.The Report of the Administrator as to the wishes of the natives for their future government is given separately for the different tribes, but it is reported that opinion is unanimously and bitterly opposed to retrocession. If the country is restored to the Germans, the Chiefs declare that the tribes must leave before the restoration, and seek sanctuary in British territory. ^Hereros. Amongst the evidence which is collected with regard to the Hereros is that of a Chief, who is supported by many others, and who declared : &quot; To give this1 See &quot; South-West Africa Facts and Figures,&quot; reprinted from the Gape Times, and &quot; Memorandum on the Country known as German SouthrYVest Africa,&quot; published by the Union Government. - See beut\vein&apos;s review of Paul RohrhacliVDe-wfcc/te KoloiiialwirUcliaft.3 &quot; Memorandum on the Administration of the German Colonies, with special reference to the Treat- -jucnt of Natives.&quot;survivors of the whole Herero nation.1 The great losses of the Hereros apart from those killed in battle were caused by their being forced into the waterless desert, and indeed one of the German missionaries (PastorTrie) estimated the number who succumbed to hunger and thirst in this manner at 14,000.Dr. Paid Rohrbach, in commenting on the Ilerero war, stated that it had been carried on too much on the lines of annihilation. Though he considered this might be right in European warfare, he submitted that in colonial wars adequate punishment of the rebels was sufficient. He wrote : .-&quot; The great mass who had done nothing but &quot; only follow their leaders, might undoubtedly have been pardoned. In this way it &quot; would have been possible still to save important values in cattle, and above all, to &quot; have ended the Ilerero war in 1004, instead of a year later.&quot;&quot;The immediate result of the Ilerero war in so far as it affected the survivors, was the deprivation of their tribal land and cattle, and the institution of forced labour. Herr Schlettwein, who gave evidence before the Budget Committee of the Reichstag on the subject, wrote concerning the Hereros in 1904 the following summary of German views on colonisation in special relation to the ilereros : &quot; In colonial politics *&apos; we stand at the parting of the ways, on the one side the aim must be healthy egoism &quot; and practical colonisation, and on the other exaggerated liumaniiarianism, vague &quot; idealism, irrational sentimentality. The Hereros must be compelled to work, and &quot; in return for their food only. Forced labour for years is only a just punishment, &quot; and at the same time it is the best method of training them. The feelings of &quot; Christianity and philanthropy with which the missionaries work for the present &quot; must be repudiated with all energy.&quot;Besides extermination of the Hereros in the principal war, the German method of shooting and hanging the natives, men, women, and children, in the years following is evidenced by many eye-witnesses whose statements are collected in the memorandum to which previous attention has been directed.3] -Recent German. Administration. -The Report of the Administrator also deals with the position of the natives more recently in regard to the administration of justice. After pointing out that it was not until 1903 that any provision was made for the hearing of civil suits &apos; between natives and Germans, he refers to the criminal jurisdiction over the native population, which he declares Avas repugnant to any conception of justice. The natives were not tried by the ordinary courts, but by officials who were also charged with police duties, and who had authority to delegate their judicial powers to subordinate officials. The punishments inflicted included imprisonment in chains and flogging, not only for serious crimes, but as disciplinary measures for offences against the Master and Servants Law, such as insubordination or neglect of duty.As to the position of natives in the German courts, native evidence was, according to the Report, habitually disregarded, and the natives were not allowed to give evidence on oath. In punishing crimes by natives against Germans very great severity was shown, whereas crimes by Germans against natives were treated with amazing leniency. It is stated that three out of every four natives convicted by the courts in German South-West Africa in 1913 suffered the punishment of flogging, whereas only one native out of every 150 convicted suffered the same punishment in the Union of South Africa.
&quot; country back to the Germans is like consigning us to the grave. We had no peace &quot; under the Germans, but we know now what peace is.&quot;Hottentots. The Report of the Administrator quotes an acting Chief as saying : Many of our people have got messages from Germans that they&quot;will settle off with &quot; us when the war is over. We want them kept out of this country, and we wish to &quot; remain as to-day, under the British flag&quot; ; while an hereditary Chief states : &quot; We &quot; know the Germans too well to wish to see their flag again. They despise us as &quot; dogs, and treat us like animals.&quot;The Bastards of Rehoboth. The colotired emigrants from Cape Colony known as the Bastards of Rehoboth were given, as mentioned in the Report, special consideration by the Germans, and enjoyed a certain measure of independence. The Administrator points out that the Volksraad of these people passed a formal resolution on November 2nd last supported by 11 reasons : &quot; That we as a nation and people &quot; respectfully but urgently request the Imperial British Government not to give &quot; South-West Africa back to the Germans, but to retain the land under the protection &quot; of the British flag.&quot;[In August of last year the Bastards of Rehoboth prepared for submission to the British Government a petition, but it has only lately come into the hands of the Governor-General, and been telegraphed to England. A reply has not yet been delivered. In the course of this petition the desire of the coloured population to be governed entirely by the British authorities is clearly shown. While anxious to maintain such rights as had been granted by the German Government in the way of land and property, the petition points out to the British Government that the German authorities took a large portion of the land from the Bastards, and they therefore pray the British Government favourably to consider their position in the matter as their representations to the German Government had no effect.]Berg Demaras. The Administrators Report quotes a declaration of representatives of these people as follows :--&quot; W7e beg and pray that the British will take over the &quot; whole land. The farmers no longer flog their servants, and the lash is not heard &quot; every day at the police station.&quot;Ooambos. As mentioned by the Administrator in his Report, Ovamboland was never effectively &quot;occupied by the Germans, and consequently this country has a larger &quot;native population than all the rest of South-West Africa. Any German who entered the territory without the support of an armed force took his life in his hands.After the surrender of German troops in 1915, the Union Government of South Africa despatched Major S. M. Pritchard with a small missioif to Ovamboland, when the following message was sent by the principal Chief Martin of 01 uk on da, to the British Government : &quot;I send my greetings to the great men who rule your country. &quot; I had always been afraid of the Germans, and have never had the opportunity, as &quot; I had wished, to invite the English to my country. I was pleased when I heard &quot; that the English were masters of the country. The words that have been spoken to *&apos; me by you have given me such confidence that I feel as strong as a rock.&quot;&apos;[Major (now Lieutenant-Colonel) S. M. Pritchard in his Report on his tour in Ovamboland, as officer in charge of native affairs in South-West Africa, observed that Chief Martin &quot;frankly stated that &apos; the Ovandonga had no love for the Germans,&apos; whose wars with the natives they had heard of, that he and his people &quot; had always wished the English would come. into, their country, and that he was &quot; pleased when he received my letter announcing my arrival. He added, with &quot; emphasis, that no German officer had ever entered his house, that 1 and the officers 11 accompanying me were the first who had ever entered or even camped near it, &quot; while Captain Bell and myself were the first white people whom lie had ever &quot; conducted into his wife&apos;s apartments to see her and her child. This had been done, &quot; as he explained, to show his trust in and feelings of friendship towards us.&quot;]Bushmen. It &quot;is stated in the Administrators Report that the remnants of the race of Bushmen living in the north-eastern part of the Protectorate share the views of the other tribes, and that they all say that they hope that the Germans will leave the country and that the English will stay.
