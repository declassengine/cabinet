PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Imperial War Cabinet and Conference. The first full meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet that has been held since the commencement of the sessions in 1917 took place at 10, Downing - Street on June 18th, when the representatives of the Australian Commonwealth, who were unfortunately absent from the deliberations of last year, joined their Cabinet colleagues from the other parts of the Empire.The first full meeting of the Imperial War Conference was held on June 17th at the Colonial Office.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Dominion Ministers coming to London. The Minister of Militia- (Major-General S. 0. Mewl)urn) and the Minister of Marine Fisheries and Naval Service (Lieutenant-Colonel Ballantyne) are expected shortly to arrive in London.Next War Loan. Arrangements are progressing for launching a new Victory Loan in October next, and this is likely to be the greatest financial effort in the history of the Dominion.While the amount of the loan has not been, definitely fixed, it is believed that the amount to be asked for on the official prospectus will be $250,000,000, with a real objective of $500,000,000. Preparations for launching a campaign throughout the Dominion are now well advanced in the Department of Finance, and no doubt is enter-tained of the ability and readiness of the people to produce the desired result, The effort, however, will be a large one, but it will be backed by an efficient organisa-tion, the nucleus of which will consist of the same workers who made the last Victory Loan such a great success. In the last campaign, the Canadian people subscribed over $400,000,000, or the equivalent of $500 per head of the population, and it is believed that the country stands ready to surpass this splendid achievement next autumn. In the last Liberty Loan in the United States, which was the most successful in the history of that country, the public subscribed four billiou dollars, or $400 per head of the population. The Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White) expresses entire confidence that the coming loan will eclipse all former efforts, both in the number of subscribers and in the aggregate of their subscriptions.Canadian Mercantile Marine, The Chairman of the Transportation Committee of the Canadian Manufacturers1 Association, in presenting the annual report of the Committee to the Convention, advocated the establishment of a Canadian Mercantile Marine, in order to help to build up trade between Canada and Australia and New-Zealand.   He eulogised the action of the Government in this respect,French-Canadian Brigade, The Minister of Militia (Major-General Mewburh) has issued a statement indicating that he has every sympathy with the desire to create a purely French/Canadian Brigade for service at tbe front, but drawing attention to the difficulties in the way. &quot;Nevertheless,&quot; he says, &quot;there is no reason why a French-Canadian Brigade should not be brought into being, providing the men are available.&quot; General Mewburn adds that arrangements are being made to carry out in England the principle of assembling men who speak the same language. French-: Canadian drafts will be taken on the strength of French-Canadian reserve units on arrival there, so that they will be trained with their compatriots. The statement goes on: &quot;The French-Canadian soldiers in the reserve units in England will, it is hoped, be used to reinforce those battalions fighting at the front which are associated with the Province of Quebec.   In this way these Quebec battalions will acquire a
French-Canadian character by the continuous infusion of French-Canadian reinforce-ments, and by ibis method a number of French-Canadian battalions could be formed in a very reasonable time. Should four battalions be thus formed, the material for a brigade would be at hand, but it may be doubted whether it is desirable&apos; from a military standpoint to brigade such battalions together.&quot;Dominion Wheat Crop.-Census figures made public by the Dominion Govern-ment estimate the acreage under crop in the Provinces of Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan as follows : Acreage. Increase on 1917.Wheat    - - - 15,526,000 .14 per cent.Oats - - -     9,133,000 6&quot;7   ,,Barlev    - - - -     1,955,500 5&apos;7   ,,Flax &quot;        - - -    1,000,800 10The Canadian Northern Railway/a weekly crop report is very optimistic. With the advent of warm weather, conditions seem to be excellent along the entire line of the Railway and a more than average crop is assured. Wheat is reported to be standing from two to seven inches&apos; high,&quot; and where frost had caused damage the grain is all coming up ct^ftiii.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Dominion Relations with United Kingdom. An important interview with the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. W. M. Hughes) appeared in The Times (London) of June 17th. Referring to the changes in the relationship of the Dominions to the United Kingdom, Mr. Hughes is reported to have said that &quot; while the whole status of the Dominions in the imperial system already changing before the war  has now been re-established on a new basis, so that the Imperial Government is now the leader of a number of equal Governments and Great Britain the leader among a number of equal States, the method of communication between the Imperial Govern-ment and the Dominion Governments remains in the form which has been handed down from an older tradition. The Imperial War Cabinet itself embodies the new system, though in a tentative and perhaps a temporary form. But there has gone with this change no corresponding reform of day-to-day relations between the authorities in London and their colleagues in the Dominion Cabinets.&quot;Appointment of a Cabinet. Minister in London.- The Commonwealth Press reports that members of the Federal Parliament are discussing the question of appointing a Minister in London during the war. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) in replying to a question in the House of Representatives last week stated that the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) would look into the proposal.Purchase of Wool Clip. The Commonwealth Government have informed the British Government by telegram of June 12th, that they accept on behalf of the Australian wool growers the offer of the British Government to extend the purchase of the Commonwealth wool clips for the period of the war and for one full wool-year thereafter commencing on July 1st after the termination of hostilities and ending on June 30th following.The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) in announcing last week in the House of Representatives that negotiations for the sale of the wool clip had been satisfactorily completed, stated that the Australian wool grower would participate to the extent of 50 per cent, in any profit accruing from the sale of wool other than to the British Government. He said that the contract was the largest wool transaction recorded in the world, the estimated returns (embracing two wool clips only) would exceed 100,000,000L Mr. Watt also mentioned that temporary warehouses were being erected at three or four principal ports in order to provide storage for carry-over clips so that full advantage could be taken of every available ton of shipping. This wool purchase by the British Government has given, according to the Acting Prime Minister, a previously unknown security to wool growers and sheep breeders, while the circulation of the proceeds practically means stability to financial and commercial institutions throughout the Commonwealth for the period covered by the Agreement.5873-3a A 2
Labour Party and Conduct of the War. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) in replying last week to the letter of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) which asked for the modification of certain war precautions and regulations, alleged by the Labour Party to be hindering recruiting, noted with gratification that the Labour Party, being desirous of doing everything necessary and proper for the conduct of the war, makes no exception to any regulation capable of a reasonable and ecpuitable interpretation and employed only in helping to secure the national safety and well-being. The Government, Mr. Watt observed, appreciated with the Labour Party the value of free discussion, the right of holding public meetings and the freedom of the Press, but, in war time, the rights fully recognised in peace were necessarily subject to certain limitations in the national interests..The Government, Mr. Watt said, held strongly to the view that matter prejudicial to recruiting must be jjrohibited. Regarding the Press Censorship, a Board of Appeal of journalists had been appointed as the result of the recent Press Conference. The Labour Press is represented on the Board, and this, he thought, should meet requirements.Mr. Watt further stated that the Government had agreed to repeal (1) Regulation 42, for the Military Service Referendum, dealing with making false statements of fact likely to affect the judgment of electors ; (2) Statutory Rtde 212, giving power to de-register unions, and (3) Statutory Rule 222, giving power to cancel preference to Unionists. Respecting other requests the Government could not see how the prevention of unlawful assemblages round Parliament House interfered with the rights of citizens to free speech.Mr. Watt added that the Government could not repeal certain regulations connected with the wheat pool, the regulation prohibiting interference with the handling of wool, punishing disloyalty, and other matters.The leader of the Labour Opposition in the New South Wales House of Assembly (Mr. Storey) has repudiated the idea that labour is opposed to recruiting. His Party, he said, declined to accept responsibility for the action of a section of the Sydney Trades and. Labour Council, but, he asked, &quot;Is the whole Party to ho condemned because some hold strong views ? &quot; The Premier (Mr. Holman) replied that the National Party never alleged that the whole of the Labour Party was disloyal.Labour Party and Peace. In connection with the policy of &quot;peace by negotia-tion &quot; advocated by certain of the. Leaders of the Official Labour Party, it is noteworthy that Mr. David Watkins, who acted for some time recently as Secretary of the Official Labour Party in the Federal Parliament, in speaking at a recruiting meeting at Newcastle, New South Wales, last week, strongly criticised the &quot; peace at any price &quot; party, and declared that German militarism must be crushed. Mr. Watkins, it may be added, was the Chairman of the delegation from the Commonwealth Parliament - which took part in. the Dominion Parliamentary War Visit and Conferences of 1910.Industrialists and Militarism. At a general meeting of the National Labour-Party, Melbourne, a resolution was passed that the Party subscribes to Mr. Samuel GompeFs view that industrialists should stand firm behind their Governments and the Allies until the German militarist Government had learnt the meaning of the words &quot; humanity and justice.&quot;Fixed Price for Meat. The Federal Cabinet has decided to fix a price for meat based upon export parity price so as to relate to cash retail sales. The Minister for Foodstuffs (Mr. Massy&quot;Greene) is taking steps to give effect to this decision, with due regard to differences of quality, locality and seasons.Trade Names^ The Commonwealth Minister of Customs (Mr. Jensen) has decided to prohibit the importation from any country of magnetos bearing the &quot;word &quot; Bosch.&quot; He explained that this action had been taken in order that the Common-wealth might not be a party to maintaining a German trade-name for the ultimate benefit of German manufacturers after the war.Industry for Returned Soldiers. The Committee appointed by the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Milieu) to enquire into the possibilities of telephone instrument construction as an industry for returned soldiers has commenced its sittings in Melbourne under the presidency of Professor Payne. Senator Milieu said the Committee should not judge the question from the commercial standpoint; he desired to know the probable loss.
SOUTH AFRICA.Suggested Purchase of Wool Clip. The Minister of: Agriculture (Mi-. Van Heerden) in replying to a Resolution last week of the local farmers&apos; association of Tarkastad, Cape Province, urging the Union Government to approach the Imperial Government with a view to a renewal of its offer to purchase the wool clip; is reported to have said that South Africa might well be grateful to the British Government for what had been done, but in the circumstances the Union Government could not, while maintaining its self-respect, now ask the Imperial Government to repeat its offer. The farmers must deal with the matter themselves, and hold meetings to show that there was a feeling in the country in favour of a repetition of the offer. (Vide Report No. 51.;Political Position. The Minister of Finance (Mr. Thomas Orr) referred in a recent speech to the rumours of rebellion, and said that better counsels were now prevailing. He declared that the position in South Africa was far better than it was two months ago, and that people were beginning to see that the British flag was -best.INDIA.(Excluding external affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)&apos;Bombay War Conference. The Governor of Bombay lias informed the Secretary of State for India that a War Conference took place on June 10th in order to consider the Delhi Conference Resolutions. In his opening speech the Governor appealed for support in the war effort, and&apos; he specially addressed the Home Rulers whom he had invited to attend. In discussing the Resolution of loyalty to His Majesty proposed by the Maharaja of Kolhapur and supported by others, Mr. Tilak spoke, and said he would have&apos; liked to move an amendment if that had been permissible, He then introduced controversial political matters, and was called to order by the Governor, who pointed out that he could not allow politics to be introduced in dealing with a Resolution of loyalty. Mr. Tilak then left the platform and Mr. Kelker proceeded to speak upon the same lines, but on being asked to follow the ruling about politics he . left the hall in company with Mr. Tilak and other Home Rulers. The Governor -expressed his regret that these gentlemen should have left the gathering before the expressions of loj^alty had been passed, and this sentiment was loudly cheered. Sir Narayan Chanclawarkar dissociated himself and his political followers from Mr. Tilak.   The second Resolution approved the development of nlan-power resources.Position of Home Rulers.- The events recorded in the first paragraph have led the Governor of Bombay to the conclusion that it is not possible to repy on the entire co-operation of the Home Rule League in connection with war measures. He. -considers the Home Rulers will be loj&quot;al only on terms, though he points out that Air. TilalPs action has appeared to result in the secession of some prominent men from the Home Rule League.Bombay War Loan Meeting. The Governor has informed the Secretary of State that in attending a War Loan meeting on June 12th he received an enthusiastic reception and all speakers expressed the wish of India to make a united effort to help the Empire in the present crisis. The G-governor expressed the belief that this meeting showed that he had ou his side the vast majority of people of the Presidency.Temporary Connnissions for Indians.-The Secretary of State informed the-Viceroy on June 12th that the Government had approved the proposal to grant temporary Commissions up to the number of 200 (vide Fieport No. 71) on the basis that a fair proportion of Commissions should be granted to men who had served as Indian officers or non-commissioned officers in the Army and who had won them by good service in the Field ; that no Commission should be given without adeauate training; and that no number should be stated in public.Sir S. P. Sinha on Secretary of State s Mission. An interesting statement by Sir S. P. Sinha, who is one of the representatives of India in the Imperial War Cabinet, lias appeared in the Press in reference to the recent visit of the Secretary of State to
India, In the course of his remarks, Sir S. P. Sinha says: &quot; I think that Mr. Moutagu&apos;s tour in. association with the Viceroy had an excellent effect throughout the&apos; country. A. full and patient hearing was given to all shades of opinion, and the leaders of thought had the satisfaction of recognising that, whatever the resrdts of their deliberations might be, the Vicenry and the Secretary of State were both animated by the single-minded purpose of so promoting the welfare of India as.to enable her to take up her position as a full partner of Empire., . . I earnestly trust that airy scheme which may have been evolved as a result of these deliberations . . ., will be treated by public opinion here with the sympathy and consideration it will in such circumstances deserve. It would be a matter for deep regret if the proposals were subjected to carping and unsympathetic criticism based on a stubborn unwillingness to recognise the great advances in all directions which are the distinguishing feature of the Indian life of to-day.&quot;Second War Loan. The Second War Loan is making highly satisfactory progress.. The- subscriptions of the first twelve days amount to nearly Id crores of rupees (9,333,333Z.), the first clay&apos;s subscription exceeding the amount subscribed during the first 15 days to the First War Loan.
