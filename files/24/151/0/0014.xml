SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 03.PART I.   BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.The observations of the Dominion Ministers upon the advisability of greater publicity being given, within well-defined limits, to the proceedings of the Imperial War Cabinet and the Imperial War Conference, deserve attention. It is obviously desirable that the public of the Dominions should appreciate the importance of the work accomplished during the absence of their Ministers in this country.The course and termination of the Quebec riots bear out the estimate given in last week&apos;s Appreciation. The steps taken by the Dominion Government to deal with any future attempts to defeat the provisions of the Military Service Act are in accordance with their vigorous Avar policy.Speaking on the motion in the Dominion House of Commons regarding hereditaiy titles, the Prime Minister indicated the desire of the Dominion to exercise full control over any recognition given to Canadian citizens.Austral t an C oaim on wealth.A real effort is being made to bring Parties and sections of Parties together, in order to discuss the best methods of getting men to support the Australian Divisions at the front.The telegram from Mr. Hughes to Mr. Lloyd George shows that the Commonwealth Government entirely realise the urgency of the full support of every nation being given to the Empire in the present crisis. The debate in the House of Representatives discloses a tendency ou the part of the Leaders of Official Labour to adopt a policy of peace by negotiation, aud the Leader of the Opposition has given some public support to Archbishop Mannix. The line adopted by the Opposition leaders does not seem likely to influence the Government, Avdiose firm attitude towards Sinn Eeinism and enemy propaganda is indicated in the measures which are referred to in this Report.The Repatriation Scheme set out in this Report merits attention.New Zealand.The desire of the Dominion Prime Minister that the Representation of the Dominions in all Imperial matters should be discussed again at the coming meetings in London&apos;is important, and indicates a desire for full and constant information and
close co-operation on matters of external interest. The necessity for this is evidently realised very clearly by those who are farthest away from the centre of the Empire.The Dominion Prime Minister suggests subjects for consideration at the Imperial War Conference. :;.&apos;&quot;South Africa.The inspiring message which General Botha has issued to the South African people should prove of the utmost value in the new recruiting&apos; campaign.The letter of the Netherlands Consul-General to the Cape Times upon the requisitioning of Dutch shipping will probably be utilised by the Nationalists for political purposes.G.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND  AFRICA.CANADA.Imperial War Conference. The Dominion Ministers have represented to the British Government the importance of adequate publicity in connection with the forthcoming Imperial War Conference. It is observed that last year the Ministers discovered on their return to Canada a. lack of appreciation of the importance of the work accomplished at the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet and the Imperial. War Conference. While recognising that there must be limitations to publicity, the Dominion Government submit that if the meetings are to receive the support of public opinion, careful consideration must be given in advance to the matter of publicity, more especially as the Press will not give prominence to news of the character unless opportunities of publication are afforded at the time the meetings are in session. In reply the Secretary of State for the Colonies has assured the Dominion Prime Minister that he fully recognises the importance of the matter, but that it is one for the decision of the Conference, lie announces that he will brine it up for consideration as the first business.A.nti-Gonscription Rioting in Quebec.---The prompt action taken by the Dominion Government speedily resulted in the quieting down of the Quebec riots, and towards the end of last week the military authorities were able to announce that no further disorder was expected. General Lessard expressed satisfaction at the cessation of the riots and praised the troops for their forbearance under most trying-circumstances.The report of the Government representative on the riots shows that if prompt measures had been taken by the civilian police the trouble might have been reduced to less serious proportions. It is stated that the Mayor and Chief of Police were warned of &quot;an impending attack on the Registrar&apos;s Office, but the warnings wore disregarded.The Prime Minister (Sir R. Borden) announced in the Douse of Commons on April 5th. that the Government had passed an Order in Council containing regulations as to the suppression of rioting. After reciting the opposition in Quebec to the enforcement of the Military Service Act and that the&apos; civil authorities had made no request for military aid, the Order legalised the military intervention that had taken place and for the future authorised officers commanding military districts to intervene with troops, in the event of similar riotous opposition to the Act, whether requested of not to do so by the civil authorities. Offenders against the Order can be tried by court-martial, and a rioter becomes subject to the Act irrespective of any claim to exemption.In the discussion which subsequently took place in Parliament, the Leader of the Opposition (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) stated that the trouble was not caused by the people of Quebec, and his impression was that it originated with the same gang which endeavoured to terrorise Montreal last summer. Sir Wilfrid stated that ho parted company with Mr. Bourassa long ago; and he asserted that if the civil and military authorities worked together there would be no trouble. He argued (hat the people of Quebec should be persuaded rather than compelled, and he declared that &quot; the only policy that will unite this country is one of conciliation.&quot;The Prime Minister said that the effort of the Government had been to enforce the law impartially, considerately, and firmly in every Province, and he expressed the belief that within the present month the results from the enforcement of the Act and by the disposal of appeals would be highly satisfactory- to the Government, Parliament and the people.Meantime it is announced that the Quebec Registrar under the Military Service Act has been dismissed and a, successor appointed.- Despatch of Men before Training. The Militia Department has received a cable from the Dominion Minister of Overseas Military Forces with regard to the men enlisted under the Military Service Act, stating that Lieutenant-Gen era!. Sir Richard
Turner Has advised &quot; that the policy of despatching men from Canada as soon as &apos;&quot; enlisted and without training is advantageous to the training staffs in the various &quot; areas. The unanimous opinion of these staffs is that the policy is instrumental in &quot; securing excellent results in regard to training. The -men are of an excellent type, &quot; easy to handle, have nothing to unlearn, and are keen on their work.&quot;Penalties for Idling. The Dominion Government have issued an Order in Council -compelling all male persons between 16 and 60 who are domiciled in Canada to engage, in a useful occupation, under penalty of a fine not exceeding $100 or six months&apos; imprisonment. The purpose is to prevent persons capable of performing-useful work from remaining in idleness when the country urgently requires their services, but the Order does not apply to discontinuance of work arising from disputes between employers and employees.Hereditary Titles. A resolution was moved in the Dominion House of Commons on April 8th by Mr. W. F. Nickle in favour of the House sending a petition to the King to grant no more hereditary titles in Canada. In the course of the debate, the Prime Minister stated that he. had recently been asked to prepare a list of recom-mendations for honours, but he had found that other engagements had made it impossible for him to give tlie necessary consideration to the matter. He, however, announced that the Dominion Government had submitted to the British Government a recommendation that no honours, except those granted for military service during the war, should be conferred on Canadians except on the advice of the Dominion Prime Minister, that no hereditary title should be conferred upon Canadians, and that after a prescribed period no title now held by those who are ordinarily-resident in Canada should -be recognised as having hereditary effect. The Prime Minister admitted that-there might be difficulty as regards the last stipulation, but said the question would be ooiisidered when the Dominion Ministers visited London in the summer.NEWFOUNDLAND.Men for the Army. The Newfoundland Government heve informed the British authorities that a fresh recruiting campaign is being opened and that they will do all in their power to assist in prosecuting the war to a successful issue.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH:Commonwealth Government and the Empire.- The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) has telegraphed to Mr, Lloyd George in reply to his secret telegram on the military situation that he may depend upon Australia standing behind him and the Empire in good or evil fortune to the end. Mr. Hughes adds that he hopes to receive further telegrams fully setting out the facts.Parliament and Peace. The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) moved in the House of Representatives on April 5th a Resolution to the following effect: &quot;That this House &quot; records its unbounded admiration of the heroic efforts of the Allies&apos; armies on the &quot; Western front, its pride in the valour and achievements of Australian troops, and its &apos;&quot; firm intention to fight&apos; on to secure a. victorious peace and the freedom of the &quot; world.&quot;Mr. Hughes moved the Resolution without comment, but several members of the Official Labour Party in Opposition tried to secure the omission of the word &quot; victorious &quot; and the substitution of &quot; honourable &quot; or &quot; equitable &quot; before the word &quot;peace.&quot; Mr. Higgs (ex-Treasurer of the Commonwealth and one of the leaders of the Official Labour Party) moved an amendment to omit the words after &quot;troops&quot; and to insert &quot;in order that sacrifices of human life may be stopped and an end &quot; put to intolerable human suffering, this House is not opposed to peace by &quot; negotiation.&quot;After the Debate had been continued for six hours the Amendment was defeated by 40 votes to 16, the minority being composed of the Official Labour members of the Opposition.   The original motion was then carried.
In the Senate a Resolution in similar terms to that moved by the Prime Minister in the Lower House was proposed by the Minister&apos; of Repatriation (Senator Milieu). This was seconded by the Leader of the Labour Opposition (Senator Gardiner) and carried unanimously. The members of the House, after passing the Resolution, joined in singing the National Anthem.The Need for Men : Co-operation between Parties. A meeting of the Nationalist Party was held last week, when the Prime Minister spoke upon the gravity of the war position, the necessity for united action and the need for men disclosed by Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s messages. Mr. Hughes stated that he had been approached by Captaiu Carmichael with a view to his taking joint action with the Labour Party in order to secure recruits, .and he had authorised Captain Carmichael to inform the Labour-Party that the Nationalists would co-operate with them in every way. The Ministerial Party unanimously recognised the need of solidarity in the present great crisis.Meantime announcement has been made in the Press that the Governor-General has summoned a Conference of both Parties to consider the recruiting situation, and it is stated that all the leaders of the Official Labour Party are accepting the invitation to attend.  .The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) stated at the Ministerial Party meeting referred to above, that the Government intended to strengthen the provision for home defence by enlisting persons between the ages of 21 and 50, who were ineligible for the Australian Imperial Forces, in the existing citizeiPs forces.Sir William Irvine. It is publicly announced that Sir William Irvine, who has hitherto led the group in the Nationalist Party which has criticised the Government methods regarding conscription, has accepted the post of Chief Justice of Victoria in succession to the late Sir John Madden.Enlistments and Numbers sent Oversea,. With reference to the statement appearing in Report No. 41 as to the number of Australian troops sent oversea, amounting to 380,000, this figure should have been given as representing the rough total of men enlisted up to that date (November 7th, 1917).The exact position on October 31st, 1917, and also on January 31st, 1918, will appear from the following summary :  .Total enlistments to October 31st, 1917 - - -   382,864Actual embarkation (all fronts) up to October 31st, 1917 -   302,455(There were no embarkations between 1st and 7th November 1917.) Actual embarkations (all fronts) to January 31st, 19.18  - -   310,980Number of troops in training (all States) on January 31st, 1918 - 9,149 Total enlistments to January 31st, 1918 - -   390,270Suppression of Sinn Fein and Disloyal Movements. The Commonwealth Government, have issued regulations under the War Precautions Act in order to suppress Sinn Feinism and other disloyal movements. Under these regulations any person advocating, inciting, or encouraging disloyalty, or advocating the dismemberment of the Empire, or wearing or displaying the flag, banner, emblem or symbol of an enemy country, or of an association disaffected to the British Empire, or the movement known as Sinn Fein, is guilty&apos; of an offence. Under the regulations, the Minister responsible is given power to close places of public resort or clubs which are used to the prejudice of the public safety.Counteracting Enemy Propaganda. The Prime Minister is convening a Conference of representatives of the leading newspapers in order to lay before them certain matters relating to the censorship, with a view to securing co-operation in counteracting enemy propaganda in the Commonwealth.Military Authorities and Parliamentary Privilege. Owing to the fact that in the last Session of Parliament, Mr. Catts delivered a speech which infringed the war regulations and that copies of the speech were reprinted and stored in the Labour Party&apos;s room in Parliament House, the military were ordered to seize the reprints. The intrusion of the military authorities for this purpose was the subject of a motion in Parliament on the part of the Opposition, alleging a breach of privilege. This motion was defeated on April 5th hj 35 to 18 votes.Leader of the Opposition and Archbishop Mannix. An indignation meeting was held at the Melbourne Exhibition Building last week, at which it is estimated 20,000
people were present, in order to protest against attacks on Archbishop Mannix, and a motion was passed expressing unbounded admiration for the Irish Archbishop. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) wrote an apology for his absence, and expressed sympathy with the resolution ; and amongst those who spoke at the meeting were two supporters of the Official Labour Party in the Commonwealth House of Representatives (Messrs. Brennan and Catts) and one member of the Upper House -(Senator Needham).Victorian Labour and Roman Catholic Education.. At the Annual Conference of the Victorian Branch of the Labour Party, it was decided by 84 votes to 51 not to support the Roman Catholic claims for State payment for the secular education which is given in the Roman Catholic registered schools:Control of Coastal Shipping. With regard to the recently announced scheme for the control of coastal shipping (vide Report No. 55), regulations have been issued giving power to the Controller of Shipping to requisition vessels registered in Australia at rates approved by the Central Committee which has been appointed with the object of utilising vessels with the best advantage. The regulations also provide for the appointment of a Deputy Controller for Overseas Shipping and a Deputy Controller of Coastal Shipping.Shipbuilding. With reference to the shipbuilding which has been commenced at Cockatoo Island, Sydney, and Williamstown, Melbourne (vide Report No. bO), therepre-sentatives of the Unions employed in this work have signed an agreement with the Government.Repatriation Scheme.- -The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Mi lien) has announced that the new Government repatriation scheme operates from April 8th, and under this the regulations are designed to meet the case of every returned soldier who wishes to secure help with a view to re-establishing himself as a self-supporting member of the community. The Minister for Repatriation is Chairman of the Central Commission, which is composed of seven members and includes two returned soldiers and one representative of organised labour.   The State Boards act under this Commission.As to the terms of the scheme, provision is made for the sustenance of men awaiting employment, or in course of training.

In reply to the telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies as to the subjects for discussion at the54s1-2a b
-Imperial War Conference, the Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) has telegraphed that at last year&apos;s Conference resolutions -were passed regarding many subjects of great -importance, and as certain action was to be taken by the British Government in pursuance of some of the Resolutions, it is assumed that reports will be submitted to this years Conference regarding such matters, and an opportunity afforded for further consideration.The Prime Minister further suggests that the Conference should have an oppor-tunity of discussing matters arising out of the war which particularly affect the Dominions, and such specific matters as the decoration for soldiers who took part in the Gallipoli campaign ; uniformity of treatment regarding the internment of alien enemies in the different countries of the Empire ; transport and mail service; special charges imposed in Great Britain on meat ami wool imported from the Dominions, and provision in Government contracts that preference should be given to products of the Empire. (See also next paragraph.) In reply the Secretary of State, for the Colonies has asked if he may expect memoranda on any of the subjects which the Prime Minister of New Zealand wishes to see raised. He also asks for information, as to what special charges on meat and wool are referred to, so that the necessary enquiries may be made.Dominion Representation in Imperial Affairs. Regarding the representation of the Dominions in ail Imperial matters, and the general question of Imperial consolidation and development, the Prime Minister of the Dominion admits, in the telegram which is referred to above, that it was agreed last year that those matters should stand over till after the war, but he states that he sees no reason win- they should not be further discussed at the forthcoming Conference.Arrangements for Reinforcements. The Prime Minister of the Dominion has telegraphed to the British Government that the 36th and 37th reinforcements will be despatched, fully trained, one week and three weeks, respectively, in advance of the normal dates. The Prime Minister also states that despatches of succeeding troops will be accelerated, but that this will not admit of the normal standard of training taking place before embarkation. The 41st reinforcement will, however, be brought into camp four weeks earlier than notified and the 42nd reinforcement will be assembled five weeks earlier. The Dominion Government are willing that any surplus of reserves in England maj^ be used at the front if the military authorities consider they are required, having regard to the difficulties attendant upon the regular despatch of reinforcements by reason of shipping shortage. The Prime Minister takes the opportunity of pointing out that New Zealand has already raised nearly one in ten of her total population and that the Government do not consider that it would be possible to raise and maintain new formations in addition to the present units, that are in different theatres of war. New Zealand has, however, pledged herself to maintain the present establishment of Expeditionary Forces in the field at whatever sacrifice, and it. is pointed out that the Dominion Government have invariably supplied eArery man required at the rate of reinforcement suggested by the British Government. If increased reinforcements are required, they will be supplied.Information is sought by the Dominion Government as to whether the fourth New Zealand Infantry Brigade has been broken up in order to replace wastage.Tank Battalions. The Army Council have enquired whether the New Zealand Government could supply the personnel for a Tank Battalion, or for one of its companies, in addition to and without interference with the supply of reinforcements for the New Zealand Division. The Dominion Government, have approved the formation of a Tank Battalion from the reserves already in England.Diversion of Shipping. The British Shipping Controller has telegraphed to the Dominion Government his regret at the inconvenience caused by the diversion of shipping, and expresses the hope that the New Zealand Government will realise that-in the present shipping situation, the amount of tonnage for New Zealand trade must be determined by the amount of priority cargo which it is essential to obtain from the Dominion. lie states that the present restrictions will not be enforced longer than absolutely necessary.SOUTH AFRICA.General Botha and Mr. Lloyd George^ Message. The Prime Minister (General Botha) made an appeal on 2nd April to his &quot; Fellow South Africans,&quot; in which he
-said : &quot; The Empire to which we belong is to-day fighting a righteous war and is &quot; passing through the gravest crisis in its history. The Powers arraigned against it &quot; are of inconceivable magnitude. For nearly four years the Empire and its Allies &quot; have withstood the gigantic forces of a militarism which has become a world danger. &quot; To-day it is still fighting for the maintenance of those principles of liberty and &quot; freedom which are so dear to the hearts of the South African people. It is at this &quot; juncture, in the midst of the terrific battles raging, in which the South African &quot; Brigade is once again covering itself with immortal glory, that the Premier of &quot; the United Kingdom sends us an appeal for help. He wishes us to bring our &quot; Brigade up to strength without delay. I feel that while chivalry lives and honour &quot; remains, so long as duty has not become a byword, so long as a common destiny &quot; unites us to the Empire, such a call for help must and will be answered, by the :&apos; manhood of South Africa. With the fullest confidence in your ready and willing &quot; response, I appeal to the eligible manhood of South . Africa to come forward &quot; speedily and give the brave boys at the front the help they so sorely need to &quot; maintain at full strength the Brigade which has already shed so much lustre on our &quot; country.&quot;The Minister of Defence (Colonel Mentz) also made an urgent appeal, in response to the request of Mr. Lloyd George, to every South African capable of assisting, to join his comrades in arms in France. &quot; Let no South African refuse,&quot; he said, &quot;and thus expose himself to lifelong reproach.&quot; He announced that- the Government had decided to release for active service officers and men who were fit and could be spared from all the South African military units, including the permanent force. The Government therefore hoped that employers would make every sacrifice to allow as many as possible of their employees to enlist for active service.The fresh recruiting effort will, it is announced, involve the complete registration of all white males of military age and a record of their reasons for declining, military service.In referring to the above-mentioned appeal in a message to Mr. Lloyd George of April 9th (vide Report No. 62 under &quot; Imperial Affairs &quot;), General Botha states that while regretting the large casualties, he feels that any and every sacrifice must be made to ensure victory. He adds that the special effort to -raise further recruits by eA-eiy recruiting Committee in the Union began on April 9th, and that as many Civil Servants will be released as can possibly be spared. In this way the Union Premier hopes the South African Brigade will be kept up to full strength.Inauguration of South African Universities. The inauguration took place on April 2nd of the new universities of Cape Town and Stellenbosch, and also of the Federal University of South Africa, the latter incorporating the remaining colleges of the four Provinces.,A message was read from the Prince of Wales stating that it gave him great pleasure to become Chancellor of the new University.Netherlands Consul-General and Dutch Shipping. The Consul-General for the Netherlands in South Africa has written to the Cape Times alleging that in Lord Robert cecils statement and President Wilsons proclamation upon&quot; the Dutch shipping question, no mention is made of the root of the question, viz., that Dutch shipping did not stop in Allied ports voluntarily, but that it was for many- months prevented by the Allies from sailing and bringing home the foodstuffs so bitterly needed. He states that the Dutch cannot do themselves without two-thirds of their mercantile marine, such as lias been seized, and that Holland could never have acquiesced in any negotiations about the ships except for the pressure of this detaining and starving policy. He alleges that the reason why the Allies were desirous of concluding a Convention about the ships was not because the Netherlands merchant marine &quot; assisted the object of the German submarine campaign by not making the fullest use of its shipping,&quot; but only that the Allies wanted to transfer it to their own use instead of leaving it to be used for the perfectly7 legitimate purpose of its owners. The Consul-General states that he is obliged to write the letter, as ReuteFs messages, while quoting President Wilson and Lord Robert Cecil, do not mention a word of the speeches made in the Netherlands States General.
