SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALDEPORT No. nb,PART I,-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.The determination of the Union Government, to co-ordinate the war organisation of the Dominion is shown by the establishment of the War Trade Board,; the Food Board and the War Mission to the United States ; while the policy of increasing the general Avar effort is shown in relation to the production of foodstuffs, and the building of ships for the national registry. It is clear from the above with what object the Dominion Ministers wish to establish an Imperial Development Board, as recommended by the Dominions Royal Commission.Australian Common wealth.From announcements in Australia, there seems no doubt that Mr. Hughes will attend the Session of the Imperial Cabinet in June. The association Avith him of either Mr. Coot or Mr. Watt, as suggested, would ensure a strong representation from the CommoiiAvealth.New Zealand.The reference of Sir Joseph Ward to the duties of the New Zealand representatives at the meetings of the Imperial Cabinet in relation to the captured territory in the Pacific, and the Resolution of the Associated Chambers of Commerce on. the subject, emphasise once more the importance of the retention of Samoa to the inhabitants of New Zealand. The interesting comments of the Administrator of Samoa regarding the attitude of: the natiAres towards British rule should be -carefully noted.
South Africa.The action taken by the Nationalists in moving a &quot;no confidence&quot; motion on account of the negotiations of the Union Ministers with the British Government for the purchase of the wool clip, was tersely and accurately described by General Botha as an attempt to make political capital out of a difficult position. It is noteworthy that the minority in the division consisted entirely of Nationalists ; and though General Hertzog again demonstrated his hostile attitude towards questions of Empire, his main object no doubt on this occasion was to attack the Union Government.German Africa.The observations of the Administrator of German East Africa regarding the natives and British administration, and particularly in relation to the influence of the local war operations upon the native mind, and to the policy of taking a plebiscite, deserve careful attention. In Togoland, as in East Africa, the latest report shows that British rule is establishing an era of increased happiness and prosperity for the natives.G. G. A.February 14th, 1918.

PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND  AFRICA.CANADA.War Mission to the United States. With reference to the appointment by the Dominion Government of a War Mission to supervise Canadian affairs in the United States, it has been announced that, while acting in the closest co-operation with the British War Mission at Washington, as well as the British Embassy, the Canadian Mission will also act on behalf of the various Government Departments in relation to negotiations which purely concern Canada. It is intended that the Mission shall direct and supervise all the Dominion offices located in the United States which deal with matters incident to the prosecution of the war.War Trade Board. As the result of the&apos; consideration recently given by the Canadian Government to the subject of improving the war organisation of the Dominion, it has been decided to establish a War Trade Board, and an Order in Council has been passed to this effect. The Chairman will be the Minister of Trade and Commerce (Sir George Foster), and amongst the duties of the Board will be the control of export and import licences, co-operation with industrial enterprises and producers in order to prevent waste of labour and material, the compilation of a record of the Domini.on&apos;s stock of war materials and the direction of their distribution. Acting in conjunction with the Dominion War Mission at Washington, the Board will also investigate the conditions of trade and work in order to secure unit)- of effort between the United States and Canada.Imperial Development Board. The Dominion Government have encptired whether it is proposed to constitute an Imperial Development Board, as recommended in the Final Deport of the Dominions Royal Commission, as it appears desirable to the Canadian Ministers for the reasons given in the Report, which have been emphasised by subsequent events, that some, effective action should be taken in the immediate future.[The recommendation to which attention is called in the above paragraph involved the creation of an Imperial Development Board, representative of all parts of the British Empire, to consider and advise the different Governments on matters affecting the development of the natural resources and trade of the -Empire. The main functions of the Board would be to continue the survey begun by the Commission of the relation between the production and the requirements of the Empire in the matter of food supplies, raw materials, &amp;c. ; to report, upon changing requirements, to mature plans for improving production ; to consider irrigation, schemes of harbour improve-ment, lines of communication by steamship, cable, railway; and to study the mechanism of trade in the widest sense:]Production of Foodstuffs. With reference to the telegram from the Dominion Government as to the production of foodstuffs in Canada (vide Report No. 53), the British Government have replied that the telegram they had previous^ sent was intended to point out shipping difficulties, but that notwithstanding this, it is most necessary that there should be an increase in production of foodstuffs in the Dominion, as it is hoped that finance and tonnage will permit of adequate importation.The Dominion Government have invited the Provincial Premiers to a conference on February 15th in order to secure united action in dealing with the problem of increasing the production of foodstuffs in the Dominion.Dominion Food Board. The office of Food Controller in the Dominion has been abolished and the duties transferred to a new organisation, to be termed the Canadian Food Board. Of this Board the late Food Controller (Mr. II. B. Thomson) will be chairman and it will work in close co-operation with the Provincial Govern-ments and endeavour to co-ordinate the Dominion and Provincial organisations with
-the object of securing greater production. It is intended that the Board shall bring the work of dealing with the food problem under a single executive authority, and immediate attention will be given to the question of mobilising farm labour.Shipbuilding. -With reference to the telegram of the Dominion Government relating to the construction of steel ships, to be owned by the Government and registered in Canada, and also to the construction of wooden ships (vide Report No. 52), the Shipping Controller has telegraphed that he will not place any more orders for steel ships in the Dominion and that he is confident that the Dominion Government will proceed with their shipbuilding programme with the utmost vigour in view of the growing shortage of tonnage. As to the building of wooden ships, he points out that there is no objection to such ships being built for allied or neutral, countries, but it is suggested that preference should be given to the former in case of any competition.Non-ferrous Metals. In reply to the telegram from the British Government as to the control of the non-ferrous metal industry (vide Report ;SIo. 42 under &quot;Imperial Affairs &quot;) the Dominion Ministers have expressed themselves as sympathetic towards the proposed legislation, but state that so far as Canada is concerned it would be framed with a view to meeting local conditions. An encjuiry is put forward by the Dominion Department of Mines as to the reason for omitting the ferrous metal industry and industries using non-metallic minerals. The Canadian Government ask for copies of the Bill which was recently introduced into the British Hou se of Commons and the discussions which took place upon it. &apos;Railway Policy. The Dominion Government have issued a denial of the rumours that the Grand Trunk and Grand Trunk Pacific Railways will be acquired by them. It is stated that no such proposals have yet been under consideration and that the rumours have no foundation.Ontario Election. By agreement between the Provincial Government of Ontario and the Opposition, the life of the Ontario Legislature has been extended until one year after peace is declared, in consequence of this arrangement, the election, which it was anticipated would be held about, the middle of the year, will not take place (vide Report No. 52).&apos; Ontario and the War.  The Premier of Ontario (Sir William Hearst) is making a special call to the people of the Province^to place the demands of the war before -all other considerations. The Premier has given notice that he will move a Resolution in the Provincial Legislature, which will be supported by the Leader of the Opposition, in the following terms : &quot; We hereby consecrate ourselves afresh, together with all the resources of this rich and fertile. Province, to the successful prosecution of the war, and to throw the whole weight of our people and the Province into the scale against our enemies until the principles for which we are fighting are crowned with victory.&quot;Quebec Leader of Opposition. The Provincial Legislature of Quebec have decided to grant the Leader of the Opposition an annual salary of 4.000 dollars.AUST BALI AN C common WEALTH.Imperial Cabinet. It has been announced in the Australian Press that the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) will attend the Session of the Imperial Cabinet as representing the Commonwealth, and that he will be accompanied by at least one other Minister, probably the Minister for the Navy (Mr. Cook) or the Minister for Works and railways (Mr. Watt). Mr. Cook was Leader of the Liberal Party before the formation of the National Government; while prior to entering the Federal Parliament, Mr. Watt was the Liberal Premier of Victoria.
Export Licences to Japan. The Commonwealth Government have informed the-&quot;British Government, in reply to their telegram on the subject (vide Report No. 52 under &quot; Imperial Affairs &quot;) that considerable quantities of lead and zinc concentrates have been exported to Japan, but that the Government have always insisted on guarantees being lodged with the British Ambassador at Tokio before permitting the shipments. The Commonwealth Government desire information as to whether the request concerning the refusal of licences for the export of goods to Japan applies to the shipment of metals where guarantees have already been given ; meanwhile the shipments are being held up. The British Consul-General in Japan and manv Australian exporters are pressing for a resumption of exports.Measures to cope with Shipping Difficulties. The Prime Minister has announced that in order to deal with the shortage of tonnage, it has been decided by the Commonwealth and State authorities to establish a coastal coal-shipping freight pool. This will be controlled by a Board whose object will be to ensure that all available shipping will be used to the best advantage.Enemy Subjects in China. The Commonwealth Government have been informed that after considerable4hesitation the Chinese Government have decided to&apos; deport enemy subjects and have agreed to their removal to Australia. The British Govern-ment. have therefore enquired whether the Commonwealth will make arrangements to receive and interir these persons; and the expectation is expressed that the Japanese Government will provide the necessary transport. As the matter affects the national dignit^of the Chinese, on account of the subject being dealt with by an ally, it is suggested that one or two Chinese Commissioners might act in concert with the Commonwealth and British Governments in superintending the matter. It is desired, to meet the Chinese point of view in this regard as far as possible,, in order-to prevent any further delay in effecting the deportations.Ships from the United Slates. The Prime Minister announced last week that the first vessel built for-Australia by the United States will be launched in a few days.The Return of Unfit Soldiers. The Defence Department is enquiring into the reason for the return to Australia of many unfit men, who have not seen active service. It is suggested that the Australian Imperial Force authorities in England are insisting on a needlessly high physical standard. Amongst other matters that are receiving the attention of the Defence Department is the assertion that men rejected in Australia have proceeded to Great Britain at their own expense and have been accepted for service.Training of Disabled Soldiers. A Conference whicLwas convened by the Minister of Repatriation (Senator Milieu), and which was composed of representatives of the Trades and Labour Councils, the Chambers of Manufacturers and the Government,, has considered the question of the technical training of returned soldiers. Amongst the recommendations made by the Conference was the appointment of District Committees composed of a chairman, appointed by the Minister, two representatives of employees, and two representatives of the Trade Union concerned, for the purpose of considering the opportunities of employment, deciding upon the suitability of applicants for particular callings, reviewing periodically the training facilities, and settling any disputes that might arise. All disabled soldiers who receive training through the Repatriation Department, would come within the jurisdiction of the District Committees. Another recommendation was that the men during training should not receive less than the minimum or ruling wage and that their number should not exceed one in six of the fully paid tradesmen of any shop.New South Wales and Irish Home Rule. Notice has been given in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly that a resolution will be moved to the following effect:  &quot; In the opinion of this House, the time has arrived for the British Parliament to grant Home Rule to Ireland.&quot;Peerage of Sir John Forrest. The conferment of a peerage upon the Common-wealth Treasurer, Sir John Forrest, has been the subject of a Resokition of the Political Labour League of Sydney, which expresses resentment at an attempt to establish an hereditary aristocracy in Australia.   The Resolution declares that the
elevation of Sir John Forrest to the peerage is a direct affront to democratic interests, .and expresses the hope that the first Australian lord will he the last. Ou the other Land, Sir John Forrest has been the recipient of a great number of congratulations from his political colleagues.NEW ZEALAND.Finance Minister and Uie Imperial Cabinet. The Dominion Minister of Finance (Sir Joseph Ward) in- a speech at Christchurch ou February 12th, stated that the New Zealand representatives were attending the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet as an imperative duty, and not as a matter of choice, lie went on to declare that the question of the Pacific Islands was one of dominant importance, and that the Dominion representatives must help to prevent their reversion to Germany. He added that any decision to restore the islands to their former owners would be a calamity.Samoan Natives and British Ride. The chief points of a despatch from the Administrator of Samoa, regarding the attitude of the natives to British rule, have been -telegraphed to the British Government. From this, it appears that the Chiefs are practically unanimous in wishing to remain under British rule. The following are amongst the reasons which are given for this attitude, viz., that the Chiefs representing the Samoans are consulted by the Administration and their wishes met as far as possible, that the British officials see that the natives receive justice in the -courts, that an English Society introduced the Gospel into the country, and that the Administration has recognised the individuality&quot;of Samoa by. placing their badge on the Government ensign.Return of Samoa to Germany. The Associated Chambers of Commerce have forwarded to the Dominion Government a Resolution recently passed at their meeting at Wellington, asking that the Government should endeavour to see that when peace negotiations are in progress the former German possessions in the Pacific, and particularly the Samoan group, are retained1 as British possessions, in order that a basis may be provided for future security.SOUTH AFRICA.Return of Captured Territory. At a meeting of the Recruiting Conference assembled at Cape Town on February 7th, a Resolution was adopted that German South West and East Africa should under no circumstances be returned to Germany.Tlie Nationalist Party and the Wool Question. With reference to the attitude of The Nationalist party- towards the negotiations of the Union Government regarding the purchase of wool by the British Government (vide Report No. 54), the Leader of the Nationalists (General Hertzog) moved a Resolution on February 7th in the House of Assembly, expressing dissatisfaction with the conduct of the Union Govern-ment in the matter. While praising the manner in which-the Imperial Government had come to the assistance of South Africa, General Hertzog stated that the &quot;Union &quot;Government had obligations only to its own people. He strongly condemned the South African Ministers for acting as agents of the. Imperial Government by endeavouring to force farmers to dispose of their wool to the British authorities. He alleged that the Governments Imperialism had led them into lunacy, and he con-siclered that in preference to approaching the Imperial Government with a humiliating-request for the cancellation of the contracts, the^ Government should have resigned. The Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Van Heerden) gave a full account of the negotiations from the date of the Conference with officials of the War Trade Department on May 19th, 1916, and he stated that the Union Government had advocated in September 1910 that there should be an open market for the purchase of the wool. While observing that there was no disposition to divert wool to America or Japan in preference to Great Britain, the Minister pointed out that the Union Government had emphasised that the Imperial Governments proposals in connection with the disposal of the wool would be attended with the gravest consequences, as they would be extremely difficult to explain to the farmers and merchants and would be deeply resented by a large 49So-2a , &quot;3
Gsection of the community. In the course of the debate, the Prime Minister (General Botha) stated that he regarded the motion as an attempt to make political capital out of a difficult position, and he denied that any sort of compulsion bad been used to mate farmers sell wool to the Imperial Government. The resolution of General Hertzog was discussed during the whole course of the day and was treated by the Government as a &quot; no confidence &quot; motion. On a division being taken, the motion was negatived by 77 votes to 27, the minority consisting wholly of Nationalists.Amount of&apos; Wool available. In reply to the encpiiry of the British Government as to the amount of wool which would be-available as a result of the offer of the British Government to release those South &quot;African farmers who wished it from their contracts, the Union Government have telegraphed that there were 190,600 bales originally registered under the&apos; scheme, and that-when the amounts withdrawn, &amp;c, have been accounted for, a balance of 136.518 bales will be left. The period for obtaining-release lapsed on January 29th.Recruiting Conferences.  In the course of the recruiting conferences at Cape Town (vide Report No. 54) a resolution was carried unanimously recommending that the pay of the overseas brigade should be increased to 5s. per day. The acting Minister of Defence (Colonel Mentz) expressed the view, however, that the majority in Parliament would not be in favour of this increase, though he stated that Parliament would be asked for a substantial contribution for the war, apart from the liabilities already undertaken. The Minister also announced that the Government would consider the necessity for increasing the ^separation allowance, in view of the increased cost of living.Production of Glycerine. In reply to the telegram from the British Government as to the serious position of glycerine supplies (vide Report-No. 53 under &quot;Imperial Affairs &quot;), the Union Government have pointed out that the minimum requirements of South Africa are 400 tons per month, and that this amount is essential in order to maintain the mining industry. The stocks held in South Africa at the present moment amount to 2,203 tons. Regarding the discontinuance of the supply, the Union Government suggest that the imports of the commodity should stop for a period of three months, and that during that time the present stocks should be utilised. This would involve a reduction of the stocks to 1,000 tons. At the expiration of the three months, the requirements could be met from local production (50 tons a month), utilisation of ammonium sulphate output (70 tons a month), balance of stocks in hand (40 tons), imports from Australia (40 tons), imports from Great Britain (200 tons). As to the local product-ion, this is largely dependent upon the withdrawal of the embargo which the Portuguese : Government recently placed on the exportation of oleaginous seeds from Mozambique. Regarding the possibility of further glycerine production in South-Africa, the Union Ministers considered that if facilities for the exportation of plant were accorded, and full advantage could be taken of supplies of oil seeds- from British and Portuguese East Africa and Madagascar (which would dequire increased tonnage) a further production of 100 tons per month in 12 months&apos; time might be possible, but this would be at a cost which would be practically prohibitive to consumers.. Exports to Japan. With reference to the telegram from the British Government on the subject of exports to Japan, the Union Ministers have enquired whether the export of scrap iron would be subject to, the conditions laid down, as it is pointed out that this material is required in Japan and that re-exportation to Russia is unlikely. ,GOLD COAST.Social Conditions of the Natives.-In the report upon the Gold Coast which has-just been presented to Parliament, some interesting references, are made to the social revolution which has taken place among the peoples of the Gold Coast. It is pointed out that the policy of the Government has been to support the native system of tribal administration and to abide- by native, custom and procedure, tempered by English ideas of justice.. The native institutions, it is&quot;observed, are-Strikingly democratic,, and the spread of intellectual enlightenment and wealth among the lower orders of:
the population has the effect of rendering them increasingly democratic in practice. At the same time, it is remarked, &quot; the material conditions of life of large numbers of &quot; the indigenous population are undergoing a great change, owing to the sudden &quot;&apos; acquisition of wealth by the inhabitants of the cocoa-producing districts.&quot; As a result, it is recorded that the native system of tribal government and the character of the people are being submitted to a searching test, and it is satisfactory to note that they are undergoing the ordeal with credit. It is added, &quot; Given the guidance of a &quot; wise and sympathetic central government, the force of. their racial character and the soundness and shrewdness of their political instincts qualify them to work out their &quot; own social and political salvation.&quot;TOGOLAND.Natives and the Land. The latest official report on Togoland states that the natives in the British sphere of occupation have 33 per cent, more land under cultivation than they had during any period of German rule. Owing to their release from vexatious interference and forced labour, the individual natives have had more time to devote to their own affairs and have abandoned their old habits of placing their farms as far as possible from highways and railroads, in order to escape the German administrative officers. In the result the produce is now grown in localities whence it can be easily transported to market, and the time which was previously wasted in carrying the produce for considerable distances is now spent on cultivation.Natives and tlie Laic. The practice of hearing criminal and civil cases in public has been much appreciated by the native population in the British sphere of occupation. The abolition of the infliction of lashes as an everyday punishment has also been much welcomed.Prosperity of the Country. It is stated in the above-mentioned report that the material prosperity of the country is increasing and that its provisional administration is already financially self-supporting.GERMAN EAST AFRICA.Natives and British Rule. The Administrator of German East Africa, in reply to&apos; the telegram relating to the attitude of the natives towards British rule, has informed the British Government, that the demands upon the natives for labour and live stock, rendered necessary by military requirements during the last 18 months, make the present time inopportune to ask them to compare British with German rule. It is pointed out that the natives generally disliked German rule and welcomed the British arrival,&apos; but this attitude, it is thought, has been modified by the period of hardship which followed. Enquiries&quot; have shown that satisfaction is general regarding the stoppage of the savage punishments inflicted by the. Germans, and particularly in relation to the suppression of brutality and extortion by the German native police. In those districts which have not been affected by the passage of troops and by the lines of communication, British rule is accepted willingly, and the British Administrator mentions that his own reception when on tour has been genuinely warm. lie, how-ever, declares himself as entirely opposed to taking a plebiscite, but expresses the view that, after 12 months of peaceful administration, there is no doubt that the mass of the people would prefer to remain under the British.Progress of Military Forces. General Northej- reported, on February 6th, that the advance column had dislodged the enemy from a strong position on the Lukuledi river, from which they had retired towards Mtarika. The 2nd Cape Corps patrols were stated to be in touch with two enemy companies midway between Mwembe and Mtarika;
