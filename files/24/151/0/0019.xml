SECRET.loiAPPRECIATION OP THE ATTACHED -WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 68.PART I. BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.The renewal of the representations of the Dominion Ministers about the possible cession of the French Colonies in America to the United States, in the general scheme of after-war readjustment, indicates a wish that the islands, if ceded, should be acquired for Canada, The British Government have expressed their agreement as to the undesirability of the islands being handed over to the United States.The terms of the important Parliamentary Resolution on the constitutional status of Canada in the Empire again emphasizes the desire of certain representative men in Canada for a system of more continuous consultation on matters of foreign policy.The Government attitude towards exemptions from military service, while acknowledging the importance of production, recognises that this is of no avail unless the Canadian forces in France are adequately reinforced.Australian Commonweai/rn.It is satisfactory to note that, at the recruiting rally in Melbourne, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) appeared on the same platform as the acting Prime Minister, and seconded the Resolution. The Premier of Queensland (Mr. Ryan) is also taking part in the new reinforcements campaign.At the Conference of State Premiers some apprehension was shown about the encroachment of the Commonwealth on the powers of the States, arising from war conditions. The agreement of the Premiers to the retention of the present system of appointing State Governors, which has come in for a good deal of criticism from time to time, is no doubt largely based on the desire to maintain State sovereignty&apos;.It.seems probable that a system of preferential voting for the Federal House of Representatives will be introduced.South Africa.The Parliamentary Session unfortunate^ closed with a difference of view between the Government and Opposition, necessitating a division. It seems that the voting-was nearly ecptal, and that the Government obtained a majority of one owing to a mistake. [p.t.O-

PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.St. Pierre, Miquelon and Langley. Owing to a statement in the Press conveying the suggestion of a French Professor that in the general territorial readjustment France shoidd cede her colonies in America to the United States, the Canadian Government &apos;have represented that, in the event of territorial arrangements with France, the islands of St. Pierre, Miquelon and Langley, together with the fishing rights on the coast of Newfoundland,; should be acquired for Canada. It is stated that the passing of these islands to the United States would be viewed with grave concern in Canada ; and it is pointed out that in addition to their strategic value owing to their proximity to the coast of Newfoundland, and also to their position at the principal entrance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, their acquisition by the United States would prove, from a commercial standpoint, a constant source of irritation to Newfoundland, and, in a lesser degree, to Canada. In reply, the British Government have intimated their agreement as to the undesirability of the islands passing into the possession of the United States.Constitutional Voice in Foreign Policy.&apos; In view of the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet and Conference in London, Press cables report that the Dominion Government have acceded to the request of a number of members to introduce a Resolution into Parliament before the close of the Session dealing with the constitu-tional position of Canada in the Empire. The following, it is announced, are the terms of this important Resolution, which, it will be noticed, reproduces the substance of the Resolution which was passed at tbe last Imperial War Conference, viz. :  &quot; That a readjustment of the constitutional relations of the component parts of the Empire is desirable, and that such readjustment, while thoroughly preserving all the existing powers of self-government and complete control of domestic affairs, should be based upon the full recognition &quot;of the Dominion as an autonomous nation of the Imperial Commonwealth, should recognise the rights of the Dominions and India to an adequate voice in foreign policy and foreign relations, and should provide effective arrangements for continuous consultation in all important matters of common Imperial concern, and for such necessary concerted action founded on such consulta-tion as the several Governments may determine.&quot;Parliamentary Business. After seven days&apos; dismission, the Budget Debate in the House of Commons concluded last week. Though it was hoped to conclude the business of the Session on May 18th, Press statements indicate that this wiU scarcely be possible on account of the Government having agreed to another debate taking-place on the subject of hereditary titles and also to the request of a number of members to introduce the above Resolution dealing with Canada&apos;s status in the Empire. The Government Bill to reform the Civil Service has met with considerable opposition in the House of Commons.The Yidwn Seat. The Yukon still remains without a representative in Parliament. Though the Opposition candidate won on the civilian vote at the recent General Election, the Government nominee was returned when the soldiers&apos; votes were counted, whereupon the Opposition representative objected to the inclusion of the soldiers&apos; votes on the ground that they were cast before the nominations had been made in the riding. The Privileges and Elections Committee of the-House of Commons has had the matter under consideration and has now decided to submit the question to a legal tribunal.
AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Reinforcements Campaign. The new recruiting rally was opened on May Cth by a fine meeting in Melbourne Town Hall, which was attended by the Governor-General, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), the Leader of the Labour Opposition in the Federal Parliament (Mr. Tudor), and many others representative of the Common-wealth and the State. The Acting Prime Minister moved a Resolution to the following effect : &quot; That this meeting heartily endorses the Resolution adopted at the recent Conference convened by the Governor-General, viz., &apos; that this Conference, meeting at a time of unparalleled emergency, resolves to make all possible efforts to avert defeat at the hands of German militarism, and urges the people of Australia to join in a wholediearted effort to secure the necessary reinforcements under the voluntary system,&apos; and resolves that every ]30ssible effort be made to give effect to its purpose.&quot; This Resolution was seconded by Mr. Tudor, and carried unanimously.The improvement, in recruiting was reported on May 7th to be continuing. In New South Wales and Victoria the recruiting results for the previous week were the best since July of last year, while in Western Australia the results were the best for eight months. Recruiting meetings are being held in all Federal electorates, following the inaugural meetings in each State capital. It is hoped that this will, give an impetus to the voluntary ballot now being organised by sub-divisions in each, electorate,The New South Wales Parliamentary Labour Party have decided that each member shall have a free hand regarding his attitude towards the recruiting campaign.After an interview with the Minister of Recruiting (Mr. Orchard), the Premier of Queensland (Mr. Ryan) agreed to speak at a recruiting meeting at Sydney.5681-3a A government Policy regarding Exemptions. With reference to the protests of fanners&apos; organisations and- employers of labour in connection with the Order-in-Oouncil cancelling exemptions of men between 20 and 23, the Prime Minister (Sir R. Borden) has issued a statement in which the Government policy is set forth as follows : &quot; The importance of production in the various essential industries, especially agriculture, munitions and shipbuilding, is fully recognised, but all such production is of no avail unless the Canadian Forces in France are-sustained by: adequate reinforcements. If such aid is not afforded, the line cannot beheld, and if-the line is not held our production will in the end ensure the advance of the Germans rather than that of the Allied Powers.&quot; Sir Robert Borden continued: &quot;If a scattered and broken remnant was overwhelmed because it was not reinforced, it would profit little to tell the soldiers when they returned to Canada that while they were being decimated our production had been largely increased.&quot; In conclusion, the Dominion Premier urged the duty of the nation as follows : &quot;In the midst of this gigantic struggle, the Canadian nation cannot discharge its duty unless its Government provides tlte certain means of speedy and sufficient reinforcements.&quot;A delegation of between 4,000 and 5,000 farmers waited upon the Government at Ottawa to protest against the Order-in-Council, but Sir R. Borden replied that &quot; the supreme duty of the hour is the maintenance of the Canadian Forces in France and the Government does not. propose to be distracted from that duty.&quot;Calling tip Men of 19. A Proclamation has been issued calling up for military service men of 19 years of age who are unmarried or who are widowers without children. The men are required to register by June 1st, though they will not be called upon for active service before July 1st.Release of Dr. lieland. It has been announced in the Dominion House of Commons, amid scenes of enthusiasm on both sides of the House, that Dr. Belaud, who was Postmaster-General under Sir Wilfrid Laurier, has been released from confinement in Germany. Dr. Belaud, who married a Belgian lady, was in Belgium when the war broke out, and, having volunteered for service as surgeon with the Belgian Army in the field, and having been wounded at Antwerp, he was made prisoner by the Germans. Mrs. Belaud was taken seriously ill in Belgium, but the Germans refused Dr. Belaud permission to visit her and she died without seeing her husband.
Premier of Queensland and Federal Politics. The Federal Labour Party have issued an emphatic denial of the newspaper announcement that the Premier of Queensland had been invited to lead the Federal Labour Party at the next General Election.   Mr. Ryan has also denied that the invitation was extended to him.Premiers&apos; Conference: State Powers and State Governors.- In the course of the Conference of State Premiers at Sydney, several of the Premiers remarked that the Commonwealth showed a tendency to encroach on the powers of the States. This, it Avas agreed, was probably necessary in war time, but the lxrpe was expressed that it would not lead to a permanent extension of Federal power.After consideration of the present arrangements for the appointment of State Governors, the Premiers in Conference agreed to retain the existing method.Revision of Tariff. The Acting Prime Minister, in -reply to a question in the House of Representatives has announced that it is not intended immediately to revise the tariff in connection with the scheme for the organisation of Australian industries.Losses of Shipoumers. The Commonwealth Government have agreed that the losses of Australian shipowners arising from enemy operations during the time the vessels are under Government control shall be reimlmrsed from Government funds.Preferential Voting. The caucus of the Nationalist Party have approved of a Bill providing for Preferential Voting for the House of Representatives. In consequence of the announcement that this measure will be introduced into Parliament, the Farmers&apos; Union candidate at the Flinders by-election has withdrawn his candidature.Soldiers and their Discharge.  The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) has moved an amendment to the Defence Bill, providing that soldiers on returning to Australia at the conclusion of the war shall be entitled to their discharge within two months after making application.The Defence Department is considering a scheme to present to every discharged soldier, and also to the relatives of those killed in the war, an illuminated certificate recording the soldier s services.Western Australian Elections.- In the Western Australian Triennial Elections for the Legislative Council the Official Labour Party failed in their efforts to replace the retiring members of the National Labour Party.NEW ZEALAND.Defence Policy. The Dominion Government have been informed that the British Admiralty- consider that hi existing circumstances reliance must be placed upon the Japanese for dealing with possible raiders in the Southern Pacific. The Admiralty have, however, suggested to the Dominion Government the possibility of establishing a1 system for the protection of New Zealand coastal waters. While willing to make suggestions as to this, the Admiralty express regret that they could not assist with personnel or material.SOUTH AFRICA.Representation at Imperial War Cabinet and Conference. The Governor-General of the Union has informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the Minister of Railways (Mr. Burton) left South Africa on May 2nd hy the Kenilworth Castle (accompanied hy his secretary, Mr. Pilkington) in order to assist General Smuts in representing South Africa at the forthcoming meetings in London.End of Parliamentary Session : Government and Opposition. The Senate and House of Assembly7 adjourned on May 8th and the proclamation proroguing Parliament was issued on the following day. Before adjourning, the House of Assembly adopted the third reading of the Moratorium Amendment Bill. - This Bill, according to Press
A--&quot;.A A-       ; A   - &quot;-..-A&apos;:-       :vreports, was introduced late in the Session by the Minister of Finance (Mr. Orr) and -contained clauses intending to prevent the rack renting of the poorer classes and giving the Government power to regulate native labour on the Rand, &amp;c.jOn the Prime Minister announcing. in the House of Assembly that Parliament would be prorogued, the motion for the adjournment was contested by the Unionist and Labour Members, who expressed their preparedness to remain in order to enable the Bill to be sent to the Senate and passed into law before the adjournment. &quot;The critics of the Government asserted, it is reported, that the Government were not in earnest about the Bill, but the Premier stated that he was unable to retain a quorum for-the two daj^s further that were required, and the motion for the adjournment was adopted by 21 votes to 20. A curious incident in the division was that owing to a mischance one Labour member was not. counted ; otherwise the voting would have been equal. Though the Moratorium Amendment Bill on reaching the Senate was given a First Reading, the rules of the House did not permit of further progress being made in the time available. The Senate, however, passed the Mining Leases Bill and the Factory Bill.Governor-General on Racial Questions. The Governor-General of the Union (Lord Buxton), in the course of a speech in reply to an address of welcome at Graaff Reinet, is reported in a Reuter message to have uttered a grave warning with reference to the acute feeling now prevailing in South Africa. He emphasised the fundamental fact that the two-white races had to live together, and declared that no one in the United Kingdom wanted to interfere or weaken the constitution of the country. Lord Buxton asserted that just as the English believed in democratic government for themselves, so they believed in the democratic government which they freely extended to the Dominions. They were confident that their policy was just, right and expedient, and had the fullest confidence that those who had acquired those liberties would use them to the best advantage.INDIA.(Excluding external affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Bengal and the Delhi Conference. A meeting of representatives of all classes in Bengal -was held at Government House on May 2nd, when the following Resolution was passed unanimously, viz. : &quot; That this Conference of Representatives of all -classes and interests in Bengal Presidency desires to place on record its complete agreement with the response made hy the Conference recently assembled in Delhi to the gracious message from His Majesty the King-Emperor of India, and its declaration to co-operate whole-heartedly in any measure which in the present crisis may be necessary for the achievement of final victory over the enemies of the British Empire.&quot;Effects of Delhi Conference. Information is published in the Press as to the -stimulating effect of the Delhi Conference. Additional offers of financial assistance have been made by the Ruling Chiefs, and the All-India Landholders&apos; Association have requested the Viceroy to convey to the King their lo3ral and heartfelt response to his message, and the determination of the landholders to give increasingly, and to the utmost of their ability, their services to the Empire.Nationalists and Trotski. Information has reached the British Government that the representatives of the Nationalist Party have written to Trotski conveying their sympathy with the Russian revolution and requesting help to enable them to over-throw British rule in India.Home Rule Appeal to President Wilson. A. letter addressed to President Wilson by Sir S. Subramaniya Aiyar has been published in the Press. In the course of this the following passage occurs : &quot; You and other leaders have been kept in ignorance of the full measure of misrule -and oppression in India. Officials of an alien nation, speaking a foreign tongue, force their will upon us. They grant themselves exhorbitant salaries and large allowances. They refuse us education.   They sap us of our wealth.   They impose crushing taxes
without our consent.   They cast thousands of our people into prisons for uttering, patriotic sentiments.    The prisons are so filthy that often the inmates die from loathsome diseases.&quot;In subscribing this letter the writer sets forth his cpralifications as a retired Judge-and frequently Acting Chief Justice of the Madras High Court. The Madras Mail, commenting on the letter, says :- &quot; We will not stop to challenge the foul falsehoods in these statements. We merely wish to draw attention to the existence of the Defence of India Act, which makes it criminal to spread false reports, or- reports likely to cause disaffection or alarm, or to prejudice His Majesty&apos;s relations with foreign Powers, or to promote feelings of enmity and hatred between different classes of His Majesty&apos;s subjects. Sir S&apos;. Subramaniya Aiyar did a wholly unlawful and disloyal thing in inviting the intervention of the head of a foreign State, and in writing falsehoods prejudicial to British relations with America, That he knew he was doing wrong is proved by his admission that he deliberateiv evaded the censorship by sending his letter bv hand.&quot;COLONIES  AND  PROTECTORATES,   &amp;c.RHODESIA.Southern Uhodesian Budget. The Treasurer of Southern Rhodesia (Mr; F. J. Newton), presenting the Budget to the Legislative&quot; Council, indicated a generally satisfactory position. The deficit last year, he said, was 43,889Z., against an estimated deficit of 79,000L He estimated the deficit for the current year at 143,09ft., the chief cause being the decrease in the Customs Revenue. Outlining the new taxation proposals, the Treasurer said that an Income. Tax of 5 per cent, or an Excess Profits Tax of 40 per cent,, whichever was the greater, would be imposed. These taxes were expected to produce 5o,0Q0Z. Mr. Newton also indicated the probable introduction of a compulsory scheme for local defence in urban areas.FOREIGN COLONIES IN AFRICA.&apos;   BELGIAN CONGO..Belgian Colonial Minister on International Control. In an address at the Sorbonne-in Paris recently, the Belgian Minister for the Coloriies(M. Renkin) said : &quot; The Belgians are now agreed on the necessity of retaining the Congo, as they never have been before.    Experience has shown the efficiency of the Belgian administration, the faithfulness of the natives, the abundance of the country&apos;s resources, and the courage of its soldiers.   Exports have increased threefold since the war, and two railway lines have been finished.   BelgiunPs freedom of action in Africa has helped in revictualling the Allies, and has lent them victorious assistance against the common enemy.   As for the future, an international control is impracticable.   It would be a perpetual danger to a small nation like Belgium.   However small and modest, that country has done its duty and safeguarded its honour when civilisation was threatened by German aggression.   The least that it can expect is independence, restoration, and compensa-tion.   The Congo needs no guarantee against its mother country.   Belgium having sacrificed everything, no higher guarantee can be offered to the Congo than the jpromise of Belgium.&quot;
