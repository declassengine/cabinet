SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 64.PART I. -BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Canada.   .It is interesting to notice that Canada is the first of tbe Dominions to bold a secret. Session df Parliament, and she has thus adopted the procedure that has been found necessary from time to time in Great Britain and France.The statement of the Minister of Militia in Parliament about the provision of further reinforcements is highly satisfactory ; it is also noticeable that Sir Wilfrid Laurier gave his support to the Ministerial policy.The estimates for war expenditure for the coming year should be noted, especially the statement of the Prime Minister regarding the increases in the Naval Service, brought about by war conditions.The measures taken tor National Registration are aimed at employing both man and woman power to the utmost capacity.Australian C o mm on wealth.The decision of Air. Hughes and Air. Cook to invite Sir R. Garran, the Solicitor-General, to accompany them to England evidently indicates that the Ministers think that questions of legal or constitutional importance may come up for consideration.This Report explains the origin of the newly-constituted office of Solicitor-General.The Recruiting Conference called by the Governor-General may do much to bring the Parties together, and to ensure that the greatest possible effort is made to recruit men under the present voluntary system. Though, certain Labour organisations seem to be standing out of the discussion, the gathering has succeeded in bringing together die political leaders, including the Federal header of the Opposition and the Labour Premier of Queensland.New Zealand.The reported criticism upon the proposed visit of the Prime Minister and Sir Joseph Ward to England, following so closely upon the last visit, is significant. In the case of the Dominions in the Southern Seas, the annual attendance of the Prime Minister in England involves his absence for a good many months, and there is a feeling in the public mind that his first duty is in. his own country. This may be the reason for the desire of New Zealand to raise the question of the representation of
the Dominions in all Imperial affairs at the forthcoming discussions in London Representation in London by a specially deputed Cabinet Minister has been put forward by some authorities as the most convenient method of representation in Imperial affairs in the future.South Africa.The firm adherence of General Botha to the Act of Union,.and his declaration that his followers in the South African Barty will remain loyal to their constitution, was to be expected, but it carries special weight in view of the recent revival of Nationalist activities. Though the recruiting rally is likely to produce good results, the anxietj of the military situation is affording opportunities for the increased spread o Republican -propaganda,. and the situation has called forth, a notable declaration from Mr. Burton.Liberia.There is evidently a feeling in the negro Republic that the Allies should liav prevented the bombardment of Monrovia.G.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.CANADA.Secret Session. The decision to. hold the first Secret Session of Parliament on April 17th was taken in order that the Government might give Parliament confidential information, which, in the words of the Prime Minister (Sir R. Borden), &quot; could not he &quot; given on account of the military exigencies at an ordinary Session of the House.&quot;Quebec and Conscription. In -reply to an enquiry from the British Government as to the way in which the Dominion Military Service Act has worked throughout the Province of Quebec, the Prime Minister (Sir R, Borden) has telegraphed some interesting details. He points out that the Act provides for local tribunals and to these applications for exemption are made in the first instance. From the local tribunal, appeal may be made to the judicial tribunal of the Province, and finally to an appellate tribunal at Ottawa (vide Reports No. 35 and No. 36). As the local tribunals granted wholesale exemptions (vide Reports No. 44 and No. 45), the Government Military Representatives lodged 40,000 appeals and about half of these have been dealt with by the Provincial tribunals, who have generally speaking upheld the exemptions (vide Report No. 51). The Military Representatives have-therefore appealed to the Ottawa tribunal and this final Court, is being reinforced in order to expedite the appeals. As to the 20,000 claims which remain to be dealt with by the Provincial Courts, all civil business has been put aside in order to deal with these cases. The Militia Council hope that substantial results will be obtained in Quebec within the next month.In explanation of the fact that up to the present the Act has not produced more than 5,000 men from Quebec Province, the Canadian Premier states in the above telegram that the passive opposition of almost the entire population of the Province rendered the great number of appeals necessary, and that the custom of early marriage in the Province resulted in a smaller proportion of unmarried men between 20 and 34 than in other Provinces.Regarding the active resistance, Sir R. Borden points out that this was confined to the City of Quebec, and that the situation there is thoroughly in hand (vide Report No. 63). He adds that the French Canadian conscripts in the regiment at Quebec conducted themselves with admirable steadiness and loyalty (vide Report No. 62), and that once enlisted there is no finer fighting regiment than the French-Canadians.Since the Conscription Act came into force, it is stated in the above telegram that of the total of 4,779 persons apprehended for failure to report for duty 1,014 have been in Quebec Province. The total enlistment in the Dominion under the Act during the past seven weeks amounted to .16,000 men, or at the rate of nearly 10,000 per month.War Expenditure. The Second Reading of the Bill authorising the war expendi-ture of the Dominion for -the present year took place last week. The Estimates total -$516,000,000 including $443,050,000 for the Militia Department, and of the last-named sum about half will be expended in Canada and the other half oversea. The balance includes $19,000,000 for the Naval Service and Sir R. Borden pointed out that the money required for the Navy was due to a large increase of this service in all directions of its activity and was considered absolutely necessary after a careful study with the British Admiralty and high naval authorities in the Dominion.Army and Air Service Arrangements. The Minister, of Militia (General Mewburn) gave a review of the military activity of the Dominion in the House of Commons last week. He referred to the fact that there were not far short of 150.000 Canadians now in France, and expressed his regret that it had been necessary to break up the
Fifth Division in order to provide reinforcements. The Minister stated that the Military Service Act had produced enough men to maintain the Divisions at the front up to strength, but that more men must &quot;be procured by speeding up the Tribunals.As to the Air Service in Canada, the Minister of Militia said that 5,000 Canadians had joined. -Speaking on behalf of the Opposition, Sir Wilfred Laurier expressed his sincere appreciation of General Mewburn&apos;s speech.National Registration and Labour Supply. The regulations for the National Registration of the man and the woman power of the Dominion are under consideration by the Cabinet. It is anticipated that the Registration will take place in June, the general object being to ascertain the nature of the emplo.yment of all men and women in the country and to discover the exact sources of the labour supply.Requisitioning of Empress $ earners.--With reference to the proposal to withdraw the Empress steamers from the Pacific trade in order that they might be available for transport purposes (vide Report No. 60) Mr. Lloyd George telegraphed to Sir R. Borden on April 10th stating his full appreciation of the importance attached by the Dominion Government to the retention of Pacific trade in British hands, but in view of the vital need of ships for the transport of troops he appealed to the Dominion Government to withdraw the two vessels in question.In response the Dominion Government telegraphed on April 12th that the vessels referred to had been requisitioned.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.     -Commonwealth. Delegation to London. It is announced in Australia that the Solicitor-General (Sir P. Gar ran) will accompany the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy (Mr. Cook), on their forthcoming visit to London to attend the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet.In connection with the above, it should be noted that the office of Solicitor-General was constituted as a permanent office (not involving Ministerial rank) about eight months ago, mainly for the purpose of dealing with the many questions of a legal character which had arisen through the Avar. Sir R. Garran, until his appointment as Solicitor-General, had been Secretary to the Attorney-Generahs Department. He is a Parliamentary draughtsman and a recognised authority in the Commonwealth on constitutional questions.Recruiting Arrangements. The Governor-General of the Commonwealth, when informing the British Government that he would be holding a Conference on April 12th to consider recruiting, stated that a suspicion existed that Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s recent telegram to Mr. Hughes (vide Report No. 62, under &quot; Imperial Affairs &apos;.&apos;) was inspired by Mr. Hughes and had a political intention. It has consequently been pointed out on behalf of the British Government that Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s telegram was sent in identical terms to all the Dominions, that it was despatched after considering the grave position resulting from the recent battles, and that in effect it&apos; formed the counterpart of the measures to be taken in the united Kingdom.The object of the Conference-ence is announced in Australia as being to consider the appeal by the British Government for additional men and to endeavour to reach unanimity and one common policy of co-operation by everybody in a supreme effort to provide adequate reinforcements for the war. Those invited are the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) ; the Leader of the Federal Opposition (Mr. Tudor) ; the Leaders of the Government and the Opposition in the Senate ; the Premiers and Leaders of Opposition in each State; representatives from Employers&apos; Federations, and Trades&apos; and Labour Councils, political unions, and industrial organisations generally. The Labour Opposition Leader (Mr. Tudor) and the Premier of Queensland (Mr. Ryan) were amongst those sending early acceptances. The Leader of the Labour Party in New South Wales (Mr. Storey) stated that he would submit the decisions of the conference to his Party, but that he coujd not commit Labour in the matter.It is announced that the Melbourne and Queensland Trades Hall Councils have declined the invitation to attend the Conference.   .5481-3oA 2
At the opening meeting of the Recruiting Conference the Governor-General moved a Resolution, in which (according to a Reuter message) the ; Conference expressed its recognition of the urgent necessity of a united effort being made to secure adequate; /voluntary reinforcements, and resolved to consider impartially proposals to enable Australia to respond to the Imperial Governments appeal. After moving the Resolution the Governor-General appealed to the Conference to give a prompt decision, and he then retired.NEW ZEALAND.Parliamentary Session. The short Parliamentary Session was opened by the Governor-General last week, when it was announced that Parliament was called to consider the proposal that the Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) and the Minister of Finance (Sir Joseph Ward) should represent the Dominion at the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet, to pass supply for the period of their absence and to consider the Government proposals for increased war efforts.According to Press reports, there has been criticism in the Dominion upon the proposed visit of Mr. Massey and Sir Joseph Ward to England, following so closelv on the last one. Both Ministers have declared that they have no desire to make the the visit, but having been asked to go by the Imperial authorities, that it was therefore their duty to do so. The Ministers have put in the forefront of their programme the future of the Pacific fslands. * Sir Joseph Ward, in an interview appearing in the Christchurch Press, said that if New Zealand were not represented in London and arrangements were arrived at for restoring the islands to Germany, it would be a worse calamity than the&quot; loss of 20 elections, and would mean for all time a danger overshadowing the Dominion.The Dominion Chief Justice and the Pacific Islands. Sir Robert Stout, the Chief Justice of the Dominion, has addressed an interesting letter to the Times upon the question of returning the captured Pacific Colonies to Germany.On. the general cptestion as to the manner in which Germany has treated her oversea possessions, Sir Robert Stout writes : &quot;It is said that Germany must get back her Pacific island colonies. What colonies ? She never had any colonies in the Pacific. She seized some islands contrary to the wishes of their inhabitants, and she has governed them as autocrats&apos; govern,.but she has had no colonies. The number of Germans settled in the whole of the Pacific Islands is negligible. The war, it is said, is to put down autocracy, and it would be a peculiar ending to the war if the Allies handed over the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands to the tender mercies of Germany.&quot;In referring to the past history of the Samoan Islands, and his personal acquaintance with the native rulers, the Chief Justice says : &quot; Let me refer to the Islands of Upolu and Savaii, the main islands of the Samoan .group. These two islands, and the small islands adjacent to them, were seized by the Germans during the Boer War, with the consent of the British Government. I visited Samoa, and I have known many chiefs of the group. Two chiefs came as ambassadors to New Zealand in 1885 ; Malietoa, the then King of Samoa, petitioned Her Majesty Queen Victoria to annex Samoa to Britain. The New-Zealand Government strongly urged that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should yield to the Samoans&apos; request, but, as in other cases of Pacific Islands, it was -refused. On my trip through Opolu in 1892 I met no chief but who was anxious that Britain should own their islands.&quot;Regarding the possible return to Germany, Sir R. Stout writes :  &quot; It would be a cruel thing to allow Germany to again rule the Samoans. It would be contrary to the Samoans&apos;wish : they do not approve of German rule. . If the Allies are to cany out democracy and to overturn. autocracy, it would be impossible to grant the Germans the control of Samoa. The Samoan race is one of the finest Polynesian races. They seem purer Polynesians than any of the other-inhabitants I have seen in the other islands, and, surely, the Allies would not allow them to be ruled contrary-to their wishes.&quot;
As to the determination of Germany to stamp out English influence in Samoa as far as possible, Sir R. Stout gives the following example : -&quot; None of the missionaries or teachers are allowed to teach English in Samoa ; one of the Sainoans Avas a student for missionary work, and, as he iutended to leave Samoa and go to Niue, he desired to learn English, as many of the Nine natives can speak English. The missionary was not allowed to teach this solitary missionary student the English language he had to go to Auckland to learn it.&quot;SOUTH AFRICA.General Botha on the Act of Union and Republicanism. The Prime Minister (General Botha) in a speech at Paarl strongly appealed for mutual tolerance between British and Dutch, emphasising the article in^the South African Party&apos;s constitution &quot; regarding the maintenance of the fundamental principles of the South Africa Act &quot; and the avoidance of all causes of estrangement and misunderstanding between the &quot; various sections of the people.&quot; When asked why the principle of republicanism was not-inserted in the South African Party programme, his reply was : &quot; The men following me know their responsibilities, and we shan&apos;t tear up the Act of Union &quot;&quot; which was obtained under the Divine guidance. Let us be content with what we &quot; have. We can build up a great South Africa on the privileges we have to-day. &apos;&quot; None from outside can interfere with us, not even Great Britain herself. I am &apos;&quot; convinced that she will never interfere so long as we &quot;keep our part of the &quot; contract.&quot;Recruiting Rally. The great recruiting rally opened on April 8th. All businesses were closed in the middle of the day. Intercession services were held in the Cathedral and Churches, the City Hall, the theatres, &amp;c, where large congregations assembled. It is reported that all the big centres are working strenuously in order to respond to the appeals of Mr. Lloyd George and General Botha. President Wilson&apos;s recent speech has been given much prominence and has been received with much appreciation.Republican Propaganda: Ministerial attitude. The Union Minister of Railways (Mr. Burton) when addressing the farmers of the Cape Province and urging increased production spoke strongly this week against Republican propaganda, which, he said, was beginning to show itself again owing to the present conditions of the, great struggle in Europe.Tho Government, he con turned, would not change their war policy even if. they stood alone as 10 men. There had been some talk by the Nationalists which was treachery to the Constitution and the flag. - South Africa had no cause for dissatis-faction with Great Britain, who had carried out her promises to the full. The Nationalists, like the Sinu Feiners, stood for nothing but egotistical isolation, lie -concluded, &quot; Hands off our Constitution and our flag !    This is sacred ground.&quot;LIBERIA.Bombardment of Monrovia. On April 10th an enemy submarine appeared off Monrovia and the commander sent a letter to the Liberian Government stating that though it was not wished to do unnecessary damage to the Liberian people, for they had been driven into Avar against their will as Avell as against their interests, he wished to state that the capital of Liberia was helpless under German guns. He added that like many other allies of England and France, they Avere not being-supported in the moment of danger, and he threatened that if the Avireless and cable stations at Monrovia did not cease work, heAvould open fire. Subsequently- a demand that the GoA-ernment should destroy the Avireless and cable stations was made and, on the Liberian authorities refusing, the submarine commenced bombardment. As no naval assistance reached Monrovia, the Secretary of State expressed to the Allied representatives the Anew that the Liberian Republic had not receiAred that aid which had been counted upon in such a crisis.   Before the bombardment, the British
GConsul-General removed tbe valuables to the British Bank ; and after the bombard-ment the French Charge dhVffaires asked the Liberian Government to afford protection to the remaining ^portions of the wireless station hy means of sandbags. This request was refused on the ground that the enemy might consider that fortification justified severer bombardment. The Governor-General of Dakar, hqwever, ordered the sandbagging to proceed, and ultimately permission was given to place sandbags in the interior of the station machinery room.The Liberian Government state their willingness to consider advice from the Allies regarding land defence, but they decline to accept the authority of the Dakar Governor-General and announce that they can only treat with the Governments of Great Britain and the Allies jointly. Meanwhile, the Liberian Government will accept Tesponsibility for their policy regarding damage done by submarine action.-
