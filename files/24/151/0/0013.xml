SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHE!) WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 02.PART I. BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.The message from the British Prime Minister to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions lias clearly had the effect of stimulating the Oversea Nations to fresh efforts. The messages that have heen sent to the British Government or to the troops in the field by the Dominion Governments show a firm determination to utilise all resources till victory is achieved. Events in South Africa relating to the message to the troops are referred to under that heading.&apos; Canada.The. seriousness of the riots in Quebec should not be exaggerated. Though no doubt brought about by the attempt to enforce the Military Service Act, the inaction of the police seems to have encouraged the rioters. The presence of the military, and the knowledge that the Union Government will stand no trifling at this crisis, should soon help to restore order. It should be noted that the disorder has been confined to Quebec CityT, and there is no evidence up to the present that countenance has been given to the riots by the Nationalist leaders.The progress of enlistment in the Dominion should lie noted, and also the firm administration of the Military Service Act by the Government.The resignation of Mr. Seviguy from the post of Minister of Inland Revenue was only to be expected on account of his defeat in the recent Elections. Apparently the onlv French-Canadian supporter of the Government, Dr. Chabot, will not take Office.      .The relationship of the Dominion to the Provinces in finance matters has been discussed in Parliament, Any encroachments made by the Dominion Government upon the powers of the Local Authorities have been necessitated by the war, which has demonstrated the vital need of centralised control in many directions.The steps taken by the Women&apos;s Conference to set about the organisation of women&apos;s effort for war purposes are worthy of attention.Australian Commonwealth.The method of securing additional men for the army still continues to be the principal problem in the Commonwealth.   While the criticisms of Sir W. Irvine are
310 doubt resented by many Ministers, there seems to be some hope of his suggestion for a Conference of all Parties to consider recruiting matters having a practical result.According to a Press report, there is a possibility of Mr. Hughes&apos; non-attendance at the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet. It is probable, however, that a strong wish of the Nationalist Party in favour of Mr. Hughes&apos; attendance would induce the Prime Minister to put all other considerations aside and to represent Australia at the London gathering.The fact that a proposal to curtail the powers &quot;of State Parliaments in favour of the Commonwealth should even be discussed in a State Parliament, is a significant sign of the influence of war conditions, similar to that which is referred to above under &quot; Canada.&quot;South Africa.The observations of the Nationalist Leader in opposing the Prime mini steps motion-expressing admiration of the troops, and hopes for success, should be carefully read. General Hertzog really confined his opposition to the words relating to success on the ground that, in agreeing to such a motion, he could be said to be supporting the British Empire. The action taken by the Nationalists has brought into remarkable relief the attitude of General Botha, whose masterly handling of recent events drew forth an elocpient tribute from the Leader of the Opposition.The scene in the House of Assembly when for the first time the National Anthem was sung by all present, except the Nationalists, will probably remain one of the most notable*in the annals of the Union Parliament.G.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Mr. Lloyd Georges Message. The following message was sent last week by Mr. Lloyd George to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions : &quot; We have been inspired during the past week with the constant news of the dauntless courage with which Dominion troops have withstood, the desperate assaults of vastly more numerous German forces. The battle shows that the Empire has good reason to be proud of all its sons. Our Armies cannot have too many of these splendid men. As already announced, we propose to ask Parliament to authorise immediate measures for the raising of fresh forces here. I would also urge the Dominion Government to reinforce their heroic troops in the fullest possible manner and with the smallest possible delay. The struggle is only in its opening stages, and it is our business to see that our Armies get the maximum measure of support that we can give them. Let no one think that what even the remotest of the Dominions can do now can be too late. Before this campaign is finished the last man may count.&quot;The above communication was supplemented by a secret cable to the Prime Ministers giving information as to casualties, and pointing out that all trained and partially trained reserves in the United Kingdom would have to be used in making these good. In announcing the measures which the British Government were proposing to Parliament, in order to secure fresh troops, Mr. Lloyd George observed that the steps determined upon would involve the greatest dislocation and hardship to industry. In asking the Dominion Governments to do their utmost to send as many men to Europe as possible in the shortest possible time, the British Premier pointed out that the issue of the war would depend on whether the Germans or the Allies were the first in making good their losses.Bunker Goal for Spanish. SI tips. - -As the British Government has agreed to supply Spanish ships with bunker coal, up to 3,000 tons per month, from Singapore, Dakar, and other ports where possible, the Dominion Governments have been requested not to supply such coal without reference to the Home Authorities in each case.CANADA.Prime Minister and Dominion Troops. In replying to the message sent to the Canadian Corps by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Canadian people, Lientenant-General Sir Arthur Currie has telegraphed that &quot; the ever-increasing knowledge of &quot; the justice of our cause is inspired and strengthened by the prayers of those at &quot; home.   We contemplate the present crisis with calm and steadfast hearts.&quot;Anl.i-Covseri.plion Rioting in Quebec. The anti-conscription rioting which com-menced in Quebec City during the Easter holidays, and has continued since, has already resulted in the deaths of four civilians, a number of injuries to soldiers and others, and over 100 arrests.The trouble arose through-two detectives searching the St. Roch district for deserters under the Military Service Act. On a young man being taken into custody through inability to show his exemption papers, a crowd of some 5,000 persons gathered, and the detectives were compelled to take refuge. Both detective officers were subsequently severely handled by the mob. On the foflowing night the crowd demolished two newspaper offices without interference from the police, but on the third night the proceedings of the rioters were somewhat abated through the Mayor reading the Riot Act and the presence of soldiers.Though martial law has not yet been declared, Major-General Lessard, who has been in command of the Halifax district, has been appointed to take charge of the military forces in the city, which include a number of French-Canadian troops. These are reported to have behaved admirably.
The &quot;Prime Minister addressed the following letter last week to the Mayor of Quebec : -&quot; The Press accounts of yesterday&apos;s disturbance in your city, during which Federal officers were obstructed in their duty and seriously assaulted, indicate that the attitude of the municipal police authorities was passive, and that no real effort was made by the civic authorities to prevent an assault or to put down the disturbances. 1, there-fore, feel it to be my duty respectfully to reqtiest from you, as the chief magistrate of the city, an account by telegram of what took place. (Signed) P. L. Boudex.&quot;Speaking in the Dominion House of Commons yesterday, the Prime Minister said it was the duty of the Federal Government to see that the Military Service Act was enforced with impartiality, consideration, and fairness, and if the municipal authorities were unable or indisposed to preserve public order, that duty would also devolve upon the Federal Government. Sir P. Borden then announced that a number of amendments would be made to the Military Service Act, including one by which persons who forcibly resisted would be immediately enrolled in the army, regardless of any exemption claim or their category. &quot; If people want to wage war,&quot; said the Premier, &quot;&apos;&apos; there is no reason on earth why they should not have the opportunity of exercising their war-like spirit against the enemy.&quot;The Leader of the Opposition (Sir W. Laurier) said he had sat for the past 10 years for the constituency in which the trouble arose, and he at once agreed with the Premier that the law must be observed, even by those who did not believe in it. He added that if it were enforced with proper regard to the people there wotdd be no serious trouble.The Prime Minister replied that the incident which caused the trouble in Quebec had occurred hundreds of times in other places.Tbe Nationalist Leader (Mr. Bourassa), writing in 7,e Devoir, has implored his compatriots to remain calm and to guard against the creators of disorder and initiators of useless violence.Enlistments and Military Service Act, The Minister of Militia (General Mewburn) has announced in Parliament that 4-18,063 men have enlisted voluntarily in the Dominion Forces since the beginning of /the war. The total number of recruits enlisted up to this month amount to 472,729.The Dominion Police Authorities in the Toronto and Central Ontario District report to the effect that during last week 4,447 men were apprehended under the Act. Only 100 of these were found to be defaulters and placed in the Army.The Military Service Council, in accordance with the request of the Military authorities, have decided to call up for military service Class 1 men in Category B. These men are liable for service overseas, but with non-combataut units, such as the Army Medical Corps, Railway Corps, Forestry, Labour and Construction battalions.Frencli-Canadians and. the Cabinet. Owing to his defeat in the recent Election, it is now definitely stated that Mr. Sevigny has resigned his position as Minister of Inland Revenue, and that his resignation has been accepted by the Prime Minister (vide Report No. 59). Sir R. Borden has congratulated Mr. Sevigny on the courage he displayed during the contest, and has intimated that he did not receive the&apos; support he deserved, and that in the near future he will be avenged. On the latter point the Montreal newspaper La Presse comments that this is an unmerited reproach to the French Province, and that instead of talking of revenge all should endeavour to re-establish harmony and peace throughout the country.In repby to a question in Parliament, the Prime Minister has stated that no negotiations have been entered into by the Government with the view of obtaining any seats now held by the Opposition in the Province of Quebec, in order to secure French representation in the Cabinet.Food, and Tariff Questions. Though fresh food regulations have been issued in the Dominion as to the supplies of bread and sugar in hotels, &amp;o, the policy of the late Food Controller has been adojDted by the Food Board. This was declared to be as follows by Mr. Hanna when he resigned office as Food Controller, viz. : &quot; There should be no attempt at any arbitrary fixing of prices for foodstuffs, but there should be a strict regulation of profits by middlemen, the prevention of hoarding for speculative purposes, and the reduction of distributing costs through overlapping and unnecessary labour.&quot;
,14Just before the Easter holiday adjournment the subjects of the Canada Food Board and tariffs generally were discussed in the Dominion Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition (Sir W. Laurier) criticised the cost of the Food Board and stated that, the expenditure was out of proportion to the results achieved. The Minister of Trade and Commerce (Sir George Foster) warmly defended the Food Board administration, predicting that much good would result from the measures already instituted by the Board.Many references to tariffs were made in the debate, and Dr. Michael Clark, Liberal-Unionist Member for Red Deer (Alta.), declared himself in favour of the Government putting all articles of food and all agricultural implements on the free list. As to this, Lieutenant-Colonel W. P. Cockshutt, Conservative-Unionist Member for Brantford (Ont,), spoke strongly in opposition, expressing the hope that the Government would take &quot; no such foolish step.&quot;Dominion Powers over Provincial Finance. Regarding the Dominion Order-in-Council passed some time ago regulating the sale of provincial and municipal securities, as to which the Premier of Quebec protested (vide Report No. 50), Mr. Rodolphe Lemieux has brought up the subject in the House of Commons and characterised the Order-in-Council as an infringement of provincial rights. The Minister of Justice (Mr. Doherty) denied this, and stated there was nothing tin con-stitutional in the Order, and the Acting Minister of Finance (Mr. Alaclean) declared that in these days provincial and parochial rights must give way to national needs. He strongly emphasised the view that the Dominion Government should continue to control the money market till the end of the war.Conscription of Alien Labour. A Deputation of the Great War Veterans&apos; Association, representing the local associations throughout the Dominion, has waited upon a Committee of the Cabinet by special invitation in order to discuss subjects of particular interest to returned soldiers. One of the matters considered was the conscription of alien labour at a price not exceeding the amount paid to the men who are fighting. In reply, the Prime Minister explained the difficulties which stood in the way of the Government taking the action suggested. He also informed the delegates that organised labour in the Dominion opposed the conscription of aliens, the application of which to neutral aliens would be a serious breach of international law.Organisation of Woman Power. As a result of the recent discussions between the representatives of womeids activities and the Government (vide Report No. 58;, various Committees of the womens Conference were appointed to consider different aspects of the problem of organising women for essential war work. One Committee was appointed to consider the part of women in industry, and to report upon the trades in Canada where women are now being most usefully employed in order to release men for the Army, and the terms of employment. The training necessary to lit women for various trades, and the method of such training, also came within the purview of this Committee. Another section of the Conference was appointed to consider the work of women in agriculture, the Committee being instructed to state in what agricultural activities women were now employed, and in what further activities they might be utilised. Other sections were asked to consider the work of propaganda through women&apos;s organisations, and the co-operation of women in the Government scheme of national registration, &amp;c. In the last-named connection the Committee was expected to report as to the information that could be elicited from women at the National Registration, the part voluntary assistance could take in the compilation of the national register, the extent to which teachers, pupils, nurses and social workers could be utilised in the registration, and, finally, the use to which the National Register could be put so far as women were concerned.A &quot;co-ordinating Committee &quot; was also appointed by the Women&apos;s Conference for the purpose of &quot; combining the Resolutions of all the sections into a statement to be presented for confirmation at a meeting of all the delegates.&quot;AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Commonwealth Government and the Crisis. The Prime Minister of the Common-wealth (Mr. Hughes) has forwarded to the British Government a message which states that in this great crisis the Australian Government wish to express their unbounded
admiration of the valour and heroism of the troops engaged in the titanic conflict now-raging for liberty and justice. The Commonwealth Cabinet express their absolute confidence in the courage and powers of endurance of the troops to uphold the traditions of the British race, and reaffirm &apos;&apos;Australia s unshaken determination to &quot; stand shoulder to shoulder with the Empire in this supreme hour of trial, through &quot;good or evil fortune, to the end.&quot; A resolution on the subject is being proposed in Parliament.Fresh efforts to secure Men. The Commonwealth Government discussed at the beginning of the week the question of more vigorous recruiting in order to respond adequately to the appeal by Mr. Lloyd George (vide under &quot; Imperial Affairs &quot;). A caucus meeting of the Nationalist Party was held at which some resentment was expressed concerning the criticism of the Ministry made by the &quot; Irvine Group.&quot; In this connection it is to be remembered that Sir William Irvine has constantly pressed forward his proposals for co-operation between all parties in order to secure the men necessary for the front. In his speech in the House of Representatives earlier in the year Sir William Irvine said, &quot; Could we not have a Conference of three or four &quot; Members of each side, sitting and talking quietly over ways and means of how we &quot; can meet the necessity of getting reinforcements ? &quot; In commenting on the resumption of office by Mr. Hughes after the Referendum defeat, Sir William Irvine used these words, &quot;Whether Ministers were justified in resuming their seats as &quot; Ministers in existing circumstances would ultimately depend on how far they would &quot; introduce, if not the spirit and a measure of conscription, some equivalent of &quot; conscription which would get the men necessary to bring the reinforcements up to &quot; the desired number.&quot;Meantime, a scheme for holding an A11-Australian Convention to discuss means to improve recruiting is being pressed forward by Captain Carmichael, M.L.A., and is being favourably received. It is hoped to secure the attendance of leaders of all parties and creeds, and Captain Carmichael has interviewed Dr. Mannix, Members of the Government and House of Representatives and Trades Hall officials, and has expressed himself as satisfied -with the progress he has made..The Minister for the Navy (Mr. Cook), referring to the need of immediate reinforce-ments, has declared : &quot; We shall ignore this urgent appeal at our peril. I hope all those who are eligible will make a generous, spontaneous and adequate response.&quot; The Director of Recruiting (General Mclvinnon) has stated that it is now a case of taking the last Australian man to prevent German domination of the world.Mr. Hughes and Imperial War Cabinet. There appears to be some doubt about the attendance of Mr. Hughes at the forthcoming meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet, according to the correspondent uf &quot; The Times &quot; in Sydney. It is stated that in a personal interview with the correspondent Mr. Hughes said &quot;It is by no means &quot; certain that I shall go. I have not made up my mind yet, but I prefer to remain &quot; in Australia &quot; (vide Report No. 61). Mr. Hughes further indicated in this inter-view that he would not be induced to remain in London on any consideration.Neiv Ministers. With reference to the new Members of the Commonwealth Government, whose names were announced in the last report, Mr. Wise is appointed Assistant Minister of Defence. In addition, Mr. Orchard becomes Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Recruiting.Capital and Labour. Owing to the necessity of maintaining good relations between Capital and Labour, the Prime Minister has appointed a Council of six, representing equally organised labour and employers, to advise the Government on Labour questions.Socialists and Russia. At a recent meeting of Socialists in Victoria the question of sending delegates to Russia to investigate the position in that country was considered, and amongst possible delegates mentioned was Mr. Frank Anstey, M.P., one of the supporters of the official Labour Party in the Commonwealth House of Representatives. Meantime, Mr. Anstey is working his passage to England as a seaman, stating that his purpose is to see his invalid mother. Press reports state that Mr. Anstey intends to acquaint Messrs. Henderson and Ramsay Macclonald with the attitude of the Australian Official Labour Party in view of the visit of Mr. Hughes to England.5481-la B
Position of State Parliaments. In the Upper House of Victoria a motion is being-discussed in favour of the Commonwealth taking a Referendum on the abolition of State Parliaments and the establishment of Provincial Councils in their place. The debate is not yet concluded.Butter for the United Kingdom. The Commonwealth Government have issued regulations under the War Precautions Act establishing a butter pool, in order to supply the United Kingdom with the largest possible amount of butter, after the requirements of the Commonwealth have been met. In future all factory butter will be subject to the pool regulations.Apprehension regarding Supplies : Commonicealth Suggestions. The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has telegraphed to the British Government, pointing out that Australia is entirely dependent on India for supplies of woolpacks, corn sacks, castor oil, linseed and other produce, and also for Ceylon tea since the imports from Java have been prohibited. In -view of the shortage of tonnage, grave apprehension exists as to supplies. While the Commonwealth Government are prepared to do all they can to prevent the misuse of shipping by the issue of import licences, they suggest that some of the British vessels returning to Australia from Egypt and vessels taking coal from. Africa to Colombo, should be used to carry cargo to Australia either from Calcutta or by transhipment at Colombo. They also make other suggestions to the effect that neutral or allied tonnage might be utilised from Calcutta or Colombo, returning to Colombo with Australian coal. The shortage of woolpacks is stated to be most serious.NEW ZEALAND.Dominion and the Crisis. In a message to the British Government expressing admiration for the heroism of the soldiers and confidence in the Allied forces, the Prime Minister of the Dominion (Mr. Massey), states : &quot; Though the furthest of the &quot; Dominions from the scene of operation, and one of. the smallest, in this hour of the :&apos; nation;s trial, New Zealand is heart &quot; and soul with Britain and the other &quot; Dependencies of the Crown, and nothing will be left undone to support our fighting &quot; men, and assist in bringing about the decisive victory and permanent peace which &quot; we all earnestly desire.&quot;SOUTH AFRICA.House of Assembly and Message to the Troops : Nationalist Opposition. In the House of Assembly on March 27th the Prime Minister (General Botha) stated his desire to move, as an unopposed motion, on behalf of the members of the House of Assembly, a Resolution to Sir Douglas Haig expressing appreciation of the tenacity shown in the great battle now in progress, and the fervent prayer that the Almighty might grant success to the arms of Great Britain and her Allies. The Speaker formally enquired whether there was any objection to the motion, whereupon Mr. J. B. Wessels (Nationalist) objected. The Prime Minister then appealed to Mr. Wessels to withdraw his objection, but the latter persisted, giving as his reason the importance of the motion. General Botha therefore gave notice that he would move the Resolution on the following day.When formally moving the Resolution on March 28th, General Botha expressed the hope that there would not be a debate, which would only lead to irritation. Tlie Leader of the Opposition (Sir Thomas Smartt) paid an eloquent tribute to the bravery of Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s troops, pointing out that the South Africans were even surpassing the glory they won at Delville Wood. He recognised their obligations to the soldiers in France and expressed the intense satisfaction which would be felt by all parts of the Empire at the motion being proposed by General Botha, who, himself, was recognised throughout the world for his heroism and deeds of arms under most difficult circumstances.The Leader of the Labour Party (Colonel Creswell) associated the Labour members with the motion.The Leader of the Nationalists (General Hertzog) agreed with the portion of the motion dealing with the heroism of the troops. He expressed his admiration for the bravery of the troops fighting on the side of Great Britain and the other countries.
Tie also agreed with the need of a lasting peace, and especially with President Wilson&apos;s advocacy of a League of Nations, but he objected to the section in the motion praying for success to the arms of the Allies. To support that sentiment, he said, would be to subscribe to the policy of Empire building which had been responsible for all wars. General Hertzog considered that the time had come for peace. Neither the Allies, nor the Germans, nor the world at large, stood to win anything, he said, by continuing the war. If the war continued it would mean ruin for Europe. - The Nationalist Leader proceeded to point out that between five and ten thousand people in South Africa were still suffering as a result of the rebellion. To vote the motion meant that they would continue to bear that punishment indefinitely, and the same was true of those citizens of South Africa who were interned. The motion would also mean the continuation of miseiy and starvation, and in regard to Holland, of the trampling upon the rights which had been long established. If he did not take up the attitude which he did, he would be placing himself on the side of the Prime Minister and he would be unfaithful to hundreds of thousands of people outside Parliament.Mr. J. N. Merriman, in a strong speech, reminded General Hertzog that the latter had accepted at the Union of South Africa the post of a Minister of the British Crown and had taken the oath of allegiance. General Hertzog had deliberately closed his eyes to the great issues at stake and had dragged in petty politics, and further, had deliberately told the House that he did not wish for the success of Great Britain&apos;s armies or feel any sympathy with the brave South Africans who were laying down their lives. Mr. Merriman recalled Pitt&apos;s use of Jacobite Highlanders to fight, for England, declaring that the fact that Englishmen and Dutchmen were fighting side by side should do more than anything else to make them one nation. He could not understand how General Hertzog could be so knit up in miserable politics as to forget the splendid reputation which the South African soldiers had gained in England, Mr. Merriman said he hoped the House would not be divided, and that their brothers and sons in the trenches would not say there were malcontents who preferred their own small political ends to the glory and distinction of bearing a part in the greatest fight the world had ever seen.A number of Nationalist speakers followed, declining to support the resolution until the &quot; injustice &quot; done to the farmer had been rectified.The Prime Minister, replying upon the debate, complained that the tone of the Nationalist speeches was anti-British. Not a single word, he pointed out, had been uttered against the Germans. Referring to the Republican propaganda, General Botha reiterated his firm intention to abide by the signature of the Vereeniging Treaty. It was the grossest hypocrisy, he said, to ask the Imperial Government to grant a constitution and then turn round and demand a Republic. He emphasised that the Constitution was framed on South Africans initiative, and not at the request of the Imperial Government, and he bitterly denounced the Nationalist refusal to send a message to Sir Douglas Haig when the deeds of valour which were being performed -are so great that even the German communiques spoke of them in the highest terms, and when a terrific struggle for the freedom of the world was going on and our own men were laying down their lives.General Botha pointed out that the Nationalists had not mentioned a word about unfortunate Belgium and the great sacrifices of France, because they were on the Allies&apos; side, yet many members of that House bore Huguenot names, The Premier then referred with pride to the exploit of a company in Gauche &quot;Wood, declaring that the deeds of the South Africans would be chronicled in golden letters. The only object of the Nationalist speeches was to divide the country. That could only lead, he declared, to civil war.In the result, the Prime Minister&apos;s resolution was adopted by 63 votes to 21, and loud cheers greeted the announcement of the division figures. A stirring scene followed as Colonel Henwood (Unionist) sprang from his seat and taking up a position in the middle of the floor of the House, led the National Anthem. Not only the members, but the occupants of the Press and public galleries joined in. The Nationalists, however, retained their seats throughout, and when the National Anthem had concluded Mr. cle Beer (Nationalist) asked the Speaker on a point of order whether they could sing the Free State Volkslied. The Speaker ruled that if Mr. cle Beer eon-sidered it consistent with his oath of allegiance he could take the responsibility on himself, whereupon the incident closed.
Senate and Message to the Troops. In the Senate on March 27th, the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs (Sir Meiring Beck) submitted a Resolution in the same terms as that which General Botha moved in the House of Assembly, conveying a message of admiration, sympathy and encouragement to Sir Douglas Haig and the forces under-his command.   The Resolution was adoiDted by the Senate unanimously.Prime Ministers Message to Sir Douglas Haig.- General Botha has telegraphed the following personal message to Sir Douglas Haig : &quot;We are watching with the deepest appreciation the strenuous efforts which you and your gallant men are making in this struggle for the liberties of mankind, and Ave earnestly pray that complete success may crown the heroic and noble stand which the Sons of Freedom are now making under your able leadership.&quot;Intercession Services. Crowded and impressive services of intercession are being-held throughout the Union in connection with military events in France.Glycerine Production.- \ u reply to the telegram from the Union Ministers on the subject of glycerine production (vide Report No. 55) the British Minister of Munitions has concurred generally in the proposals for meeting monthly requirements. It is pointed out, however, that in view of the present shipping situation it would be desirable to continue the importation into South Africa of Australian and New Zealand glycerine, and to regulate shipments from the United Kingdom accordingly. The matters discussed by the Union Ministers in a more recent message (vide Report No. 61) will be dealt with later by the British authorities.N i ASA LAND.Restoration of German Ea$t Africa. At a meeting of residents of Blantyre held on March 27th, a Resolution was unanimously adopted against the restoration to Germany of German East Africa.GERMAN  EAST  AFRICA.Progress of Military Forces. General Northey reported on March 28th that the enemy in Msalu district were apparently&apos; packing up for a new move northward. He stated that half a battalion of the 2nd Cape Corps from Mtarika, and half a battalion of 2/lst King&apos;s African Rifles from Luambala were commencing a converging movement on Msalu. Further movements of troops were reported in other-directions.
