PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.IMPERIAL  AFFAIRS.Serious Position of Glycerine. The attention of the Governments of the Australian Commonwealth, Dominion of New Zealand, and Union of South Africa, has been called to the serious position of glycerine supplies. It is pointed out that as a result of the. requisitioning policy in the United Kingdom and the help given by the Dominion and Allied Governments, it was possible between August 1915 and the beginning of 1917 to accumulate a large reserve of glycerine for the purpose of meeting the require-ments brought about 103- the increased manufacture of propulsive explosives. But since March last the consumption of this commodity has exceeded the supply by about 500 tons a month, and the shipping problem has added to the difficulties. It is stated, therefore, that the necessity has arisen to reduce the consumption of glycerine, and to endeavour to secure increased supplies from oversea.It is suggested to the Australian and New Zealand Governments that they should take complete charge of the production of glycerine in order to reduce industrial consumption to a minimum 011 the lines adopted in the United Kingdom, where a reduction has been effected from 400 tons to 10 tons per month. The steps that might be taken regarding production are also suggested.As regards South Africa (vide Reports No. 52 and No. 49), it is observed that the Minister of Munitions does not propose/to further reduce the allocation of glycerine for the manufacture of blasting explosives, but it is thought desirable that the stock held by manufacturers should be reduced from four months to one months require-ments, and that therefore the supply should be discontinued temporarily.^The views of the Union Ministers are sought on this, and it is indicated that in any case, the price of glycerine to manufacturers is like!y to be greatly increased. Steps regarding production are suggested on similar lines to those put before Australia, and New Zealand.Re-exportation of Goods to Russia,. In reply to the telegram from the British Government as to the re-exportation of goods to Russia from Japan (vide Report No. 52), the Government of the Australian Commonwealth state that sausage casings are the only goods exported to Japan which are not guaranteed against re-exportation to neutral countries. Tallow, it is observed, is only exported to Japan if consigned to the British Ambassador or British Consuls. The Australian Government, therefore, wish to know if the telegram from the British Government refers to goods other than those above mentioned. The New Zealand Government have agreed not to allow the export of goods to Japan except under the conditions suggested.CANADA.Quebec and Separation.---The debate on the motion in the Quebec Legislature relating to the separation of the Province from the Dominion has been continued, aud the Premier (Sir Lomer Gouin) made an interesting speech, in the course of which he declared that he was not in favour of the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition that the Imperial authorities should -be petitioned to disallow the Military Service Act. As to the substance of the motion itself, the Premier pointed out that there were 500,000 French-Canadians in the other Provinces, and he did not believe that these would be in a better position Outside the Confederation. Quebec, he said, suffered only from unjust articles and oral insults which were not-enough to justify
-separation. lie concluded : Confederation is the only method of Government for &quot; Canada, and if it were given to me to choose between Confederation or revert to the &quot;system previously prevailing, J would vote strongly for Confederation.&quot; -In the result, Mr. Francoeur withdrew his motion, and in doing so stated that &apos; he did not desire a rupture of the Confederation, hut that if the campaign of vilification continued, the separation of Quebec would-be inevitable.Labour Problems. The, recognition of the importance of a thorough understanding of labour questions was indicated in the action which, as announced in the last Report (No. 52), the Dominion Government have taken already. This is further emphasised by the fact that the Dominion Government have appoiuted a special Commission to visit Washington for the purpose of studying labour problems in the United States. The Commission is representative of industrial and labour interests and. includes Senator Robertson, the Labour representative in the Cabinet. The duties of the -Commission will be to examine the measures which have been adopted in the United States in order to obtain the best results from labour, especially in relation to the production of foodstuffs and raw material.A report will be made by the Commission as soon as possible to the Dominion Government so as to enable the latter to have full information before them in dealing with labour questions in the Dominion.Japanese and Military Service. The Dominion Government have issued an Order-in-Council exempting Japanese residents in Canada, whether naturalised or not, from the Military Service Act. This action has been taken as a result of representation of Japanese citizens who submitted that as they were not entitled to vote in the Provinces in which they resided, they should not be subject to compulsory military service.Production of Foodstuffs. With regard to the telegram from the British Government relating to the curtailment of imports, necessitated by the further tonnage difficulties due to the comparative failure of the Italian and French harvests (vide Report No. 49 under &quot;Imperial Affairs&quot;), the Dominion Government have telegraphed that they assume that the production of foodstuffs in Canada should be maintained at the present level, but that the provision of ships should at the same time be brought to and kept at the greatest maximum possible.Food Controller. The Dominion Food Controller (Mr. W. J. Manna) has resigned his position owing to private reasons, and Mr. S. B. Thompson, who has been acting as Assistant Food Controller, has been appointed to the position.Dominion Production. -The Canadian wheat production per head of population is now higher than that of any other country, being 70-J- bushels per head.Reports from the: Premiers of the different Provinces on Canadian production have recently been made. The Premier of Ontario (Mr. Hearst) states thai &quot; in the three &quot; great branches of production, viz., agriculture, mining and. lumbering, the past year &quot; has been one of more than ordinary prosperity.&quot; The Premier of Quebec (Sir Lomer Gouin) states that the industrial future of Quebec is mainly to be found in its forests and its water powers. Nowhere else, he states, are there such favourable oppor-tunities for the manufacture of paper. The Premier of Nova Scotia (Mr. Murray) comments upon the large amount of war material manufactured during the year, -while the Premier of Manitoba (Mr. Norris) observes that the farms in the Province have never been in a better condition to carry on. The Premier of Saskatchewan (Mr. Martin) states that the real estate booms have not altogether passed away, but, speaking generally, the farmers on the plains and the merchants in the towns arc in a better financial position to-day than at any previous time.Ships on Canadian-South African Service. In reply to the observation of the Dominion Government concerning the proposed i-equisitioning of ships on the Canadian-South African Service (vide Report No. 51), the Shipping Controller has pointed out that the action is due entirely to the necessity of finding tonnage for the most urgent national requirements, but he states that, he -will make every endeavour to restore the service at the first opportunity available.
Tin Supplies after the War. The British Government have called the attention of the Dominion Government to the question of the relation of available tin supplies-to requirements ,after the war and they have asked to be supplied with approximate figures for a period of three years after the war as to the post-war production of tin ore, metal and plates, the amount of tin ore likely to be smelted locally or sent to-other countries for smelting, and the amounts of tin metal and tin plates required from outside sources.In reply the Dominion Government have stated that no tin ore is produced or smelted in Canada and that the probable annual requirements after the war would be as regards tin metal, 2,400 short tons ; tin foil GOO short tons ; and tin plate 65,000-short tons.Canadian Aviation Fund, dins fund, now exceeds 30,000L, and provides for the constrnotion of 16 aeroplanes, 10 of which are to be made and used in the Dominion and 6 are intended for operations against the enemy.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Programme of Federal Government. The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), when moving the indefinite adjournment of the House last week, announced that the Commonwealth Government have decided to devote immediate and earnest attention to the questions of providing reinforcements for the Australian Divisions and of making arrangements for repatriation. He also announced that shipbuilding, the re-organisation of industry and the whole question of industrial legislation will receive particular attention at an early date. -The arrangements in contemplation with regard to the organisation of the industry of the Commonwealth were outlined in Report No. 41.Proportional P epresentation. The Commonwealth Minister for Home Affairs and Territories (Mr. Glynn) has announced that the Federal Cabinet are considering-the question of introducing proposals for rjroportional representation in respect of elections for the Senate. He has also announced that the Cabinet are considering a jDroposal to introduce preferential voting in regard to elections for the House of Representatives.Maintenance of Australian Troops. The Commonwealth Government have-intimated to the British Government that, although anxious to repay the rest of the sum which was advanced for the maintenance of Australian troops up to the 30th of June 1917, they find that, owing to the present and anticipated large war expenditure (already- reaching 200,000,0001.) they are not prepared to reimburse at present more than 1,000,000L per week, up to a limit of 5,000,000Z. They suggest that the rest of the amount up to June 30th, 1917, should bear interest from that date, and that repayments of the principal sum should be made from time to time. The views of the British Treasury are sought by the Commonwealth Government- on the subject.Settlement of British Soldiers on Neio South Wales Land. The New South Wales-Minister for Lands (Mr. Ashford), in explaining the Government scheme for settling-British soldiers on the land after the war, states that the proposal is contingent upon financial provision being made by the British Government. For the settlement of 1,000 British soldiers the New South Wales Government require 1,500,000Z., which would be devoted to the provision of the necessary land and public works.In connection with the above, it should be noted that the Australian Common-wealth Government have recognised the obligation to provide, in the first instance, for the settlement on the land of those Australian soldiers who desire it. The practical work of settlement is then to be carried out by each of the individual States who-control land policy. After the visit of Sir Rider Haggard to the Commonwealth in 1916,. the New South Wales Government announced that an effort would be made to provide ior the settlement of 1.000 British soldiers on the land after the war.-   In 1917, during;
Mr: Holmans visit to England, a further pronouncement was made that the State hoped to provide for settling 5,000 British soldiers on the land if the necessary money was forthcoming, the financing of each settler being put at f ronv 400Z. to 500Z. Since then, however, as the Agent-General for New South Wales (Sir Charles Wade) has recently pointed out, the State has been compelled to curtail its loan expenditure, which affords the chief means of developing land settlement through the medium of railways, water conservation, &amp;c. In consequence the Minister for Lands has sorne-what modified his previous proposals with regard even to the settlement of the 1,000 British soldiers, and the present policy of the State is to embark on no extensive expenditure in this connection unless the British Government co-operate in sharing the burden.New South- Wales Government and Conscription. AVith reference to the part which the Premier of New South Wales (Mr. Holman) and other Members oi his Ministry have taken in advocating conscription, the Leader of the Labour Opposition in the New South Wales State Parliament (Mr. Storey) has given notice that he will move a vote of censure upon the Government on the ground that they have, broken their pledge regarding conscription. The pledge mentioned no doubt refers to the undertaking given during the State elections in March last by some individual members of the Ministry that, having regard to the verdict of the people.in the Referendum of the previous year, they would not advocate conscription during the life of that Parliament.NEW ZEALAND.Representation at Peace Conference: Pacific Colonies. The Prime Minister (Mr. M-assey) has called attention to the importance of the representation of Australasia at the Peace Conference on account&quot; of the possibility of a peace beino-agreed upon which would involve the restoration of Samoa to Germany. This, he states, would.be nothing short of a national calamity from the standpoint of British interests in the Pacific. (An announcement upon this subject will be found under the head of &quot; The Pacific &quot; below.)SOUTH  AFRICA.Return of Captured Territory. An important pronouncement on this subject by General Smuts is given in the Appendix to this Report.Native Labour. The Union Government have telegraphed to. the effect that the men who had enlisted in the South African Native Labour contingent, and were ready to be transported, are now being discharged. Arrangements have been concluded to recruit no further natives.   (Vide Report No. 52.) ;Mining Difficulties. With reference to the difficulties connected.with the working of certain low-grade gold mines, to which attention was recentlj&quot; directed by the President of the Chamber of Mines (vide Report No. 52), the Minister of Alines (Mr. Alalan) has proposed in the House of Assembly the appointment of a Select Committee to consider the problem brought about by the increased working cost and the decrease of native labour. The matter is now engaging the attention of the House of Assembly and various suggestions are being made, such as assisting with bounties, the provision of loans, the reduction of the insurance and freight charges, &amp;c. On January 25th, Mr. Merriman moved an amendment to the proposals before the House which would have the effect of instructing the Select Committee to consider the whole economic and labour conditions in the gold mining industry. Upon this proposal, the Leader of the Labour Party (ColonelCreswell) proposed that the Government should administer, during the war, any mine which found it necessarv to close down ; and he urged the direct control of the gold mining industry by the State.4701-5a - B
GERMAN AFRICA.Operations against the Enemy. A report lias been received from General Northey that the enemy operating in East Africa have been driven towards Mtarika, in &quot;the neighbourhood of which Generals Von Lettow and Schnee occupy the country with about six companies. There are five other companies at Mwernbe, where the advance troops have been driven eastwards by the 2nd Cape Corps.BELGIAN CONGO.Colonies in Tropical Africa : Belgian Attitude. The Belgian Minister in London has represented to the Foreign Office that the scheme announced in the British Labour Manifesto of placing the colonies of the belligerents in Tropical africa under some form of international control, would be strongly opposed by Belgium as the proposal would mean the surrender of Belgian rights in the Congo State. The Congo, he pointed out, was now being well governed and administered, and he stated that it would be a great injustice to Belgium if, as a result of the war, the country should lose her most valuable African possession. For the present the-Foreign Office have aiven a non-committal reply.THE PACIFIC.Importance of Pacific Colonies to. Germany. The Association of South Sea firms at Hamburg has forwarded a Memorandum to the German Reichstag calling attention to the great value of the German Colonies in the South Seas and to the importance of their return to Germany on the conclusion of peace. The Association refers to the great significance of these possessions, not only because they produce valuable material, but on account of the great strategic value of their ports and the favourable situation which they occupy for the establishment of wireless installations.1 This was declared to include colonies whether north of the Zambesi River and south of the Sahara Desert or only those tying between 15 degrees north and 15 degrees south latitude, which are already the subject of international control.
APPENDIX Western and General Report No. 53.   Part I.German Ambitions and British Policy in Africa.An important lecture was * delivered on January 28th, 1918, by General Smuts before a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society. Certain passages which related to the subjects comprised in the above heading have been extracted from the original text of the lecture and are given below : German Policy in East Africa. &quot;It is clear from their practice in East Africa that the Germans had decided to develop the country not as an ordinary colony, but as a tropical possession for the cultivation of tropical raw materials. They systematically discouraged white settlement. . . Instead, tracts of country were granted to companies, syndicates, or individuals with large capital, on condition that plantations for tropical products were cultivated.&quot;Germany and a Central African Empire. &quot; German colonial aims are really not colonial, but are entirely dominated by far-reaching conceptions of world politics. Not colonies, but military power and strategic possessions for exercising world power in future are her real aims. Her ultimate objective in Africa is the establishment of a great Central African. Empire, comprising not only her colonies before the war. but also all the English, French, Belgian, and Portuguese possessions south of the Sahara and Lake Chad and north of the Zambesi river in South Africa. Towards this, objective she was steadily marching even before the war broke out. and she claims the return of her lost African colonies at the end of the war as a starting point from which to resume the interrupted march. Or rather, as appears from Count Hertlingls.. recent pronouncement, she claims a re-allocation of the workbs colonies, so that she may have a share commensurate to her world position.&quot; This Central African&quot;block, the maps of which are now in course of preparation and printing at the Colonial Office in Berlin, is intended, in the first place, to supply the economic requirements and raw materials of German industry ; and in the second, and far more important, place, to become the recruiting ground for vast native armies, the great value of which has been demonstrated in the tropical campaigns of this war, and especially in East Africa; while the natural harbours on the Atlantic and Indian Oceans will supply the naval and submarine bases from which both ocean routes will be dominated and British and American sea power will be brought to naught.&quot;[In support of the above General Smuts gave various quotations from German authorities.]Standpoint of the British Empire.-&quot; The point of view of the British Empire is A&apos;ery different indeed. In the first place, it has never had any military ambitions, apart from the measure of sea power essential to its continued existence. In Africa it has never militarised the natives and has always opposed any such policy, and has always tended to study the natives&apos; interests.&quot; In the second place, the objects pursued by British policy on the African continent are inherently pacific and defensive. We desire no man&apos;s territory and only to live in peace and develop the great African territories and populations entrusted to our care. These territories, apart from the West African Colonies, stretch in a great chain of states all across the high plateau or backbone of the African continent from Egypt in the north to the Union of South Africa at the other end of the continent, and German East Africa was the only break in this great chain. The British Empire is far and away the greatest African Power, and no other Power has interests on that continent at all comparable to it. Looking at the future from the broadest points of view, looking at the magnitude of its material African interests and the future welfare of the-vast native populations, and its difficult task of civilizing the Dark Continent; looking, further, upon Africa as the half-way house to India and Australasia, the British Empire asks only for peace and security 
internal peace and-security of its external communications. It cannot allow the return of conditions which mean the militarisation of the natives and their employ--ment for schemes of world power; it cannot allow naval, and submarine bases to be organised on both sides of the African coast, to the endangerment&apos; of the sea communications of the Empire and the peace of the world. And it must insist on the maintenance of conditions which will guarantee through land communications for its territories from one end of the continent to the other.&quot;Dominions- and Disposal of German Colonies. As to, the attitude of the oversea nations of the Empire towards proposals for the restoration of captured German, territory, General Smuts said : &quot;As long as there is no real change of heart in Germany, and no final and irrevocable break wdth militarism, the law of self-preservation should be considered paramount. No fresh extension of Prussian militarism to other continents and&quot; seas should be tolerated ; and the conquered German colonies can only be regarded as guarantees for the security of the future peace of the world. This opinion will be shared, I feel sure, by the vast bulk of the young nations who form the Dominions of the British Empire. They have no military aims or ambitions ; their tasks are solely the tasks of peace ; their greatest interest and aim is peace. . . . They should-not be asked to consent to the restoration to a militant Germany of fresh footholds for militarism in the southern hemisphere, and thus to endanger the future of their young and rising communities, who are developing the waste spaces of the earth. They want a new Monroe Doctrine for the South, as there has been a Monroe Doctrine for the West, to protect it against European militarism. Behind the sheltering; wall of such a doctrine they promise to build up a great new, peaceful world, not only for themselves, but for the many millions of black folk entrusted to their care.&quot;
