secret.APPRECIATION OP THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 71.PART I.   BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Canada.Tlie information given in the Report about the recruiting of French Canadians in Quebec Province is interesting ; it shows that the firm but tactful policy adopted by the Government at the beginning of the difficulties has produced good results.The measures taken to prevent evasion from Military Service show that desertion from the Canadian Forces Avill be difficult,A ustraltan  CoilM on wealth.Mr. Hughes has delivered in the United States a speech in which he outlined a Monroe doctrine for the South Pacific. This is perhaps the most important he has delivered on the Pacific question. The common interests of Australia and the United States, which have developed so greatly in the commercial sphere during the war, tend to cause the Commonwealth to look to the great Republic for common action in the effort to keep Germany from menacing the safety of the Pacific seas.It is satisfactory to notice that the Leader of the Opposition is now taking an active part in the recruiting campaign.As affecting the attitude of official Labour towards&apos; the war, it is noticeable that the prayer for soldiers and sailors adopted by Parliament does not seem to have met with any such criticism as that made by some exponents of Labour when the Resolu-tion of congratulation to the troops was previously proposed in Parliament.The determination not to permit the anti-war extremists to dominate the Trades Unions seems to have led to a somewhat complicated situation in New South Wales.This Report shows that the establishment of the Institute of Science and Industry and State Councils as part of the Government scheme of trade organisation is proceeding satisfactorily.The War Loan Bill, which has passed the Federal House of Representatives, is a striking tribute to the war effort of Australia. If the same amount is to be raised locally every year as indicated by the Acting Prime Minister, it would mean some-thing like 16L per head of the population.South Africa.Mr. Burton, the Union Minister of Railways and Harbours, is the first Dominion, Minister to arrive for the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet and Conference.The references to recruiting for the Royal Air Force are of interest.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.French-Canadian Recruiting.   The Minister of Militia (Major-General S. C. Mewburn), addressing newly recruited French-Canadian soldiers at Montreal last week, expressed his appreciation of the manner in which the young men of the Province of Quebec were now responding to the call to arms. The &quot;Minister said they would soon have the opportunity to emulate the brilliant exploits of their compatriots of the 22nd Battalion and other regiments which had done so much to win glory for the French-Canadian race on the battlefields of France and Belgium.As an example of the manner in which the French-Canadians are coming-forward, the case of the Second Depot Battalion may be given. This battalion, for the first time since its formation, is reported to be over strength, the authorised strength being 1,138 men, whereas there are how 1J70 men enrolled. Nearly 400 were added to the roll in one day.The officer in command of the French-Canadian Depot at Montreal has made a statement, which appears in the Press, to the effect that the men are reporting for service in such numbers that it is difficult to meet the demand for uniforms, blankets, and other equipment.   This officer states :  &quot; The response to the call is splendid, not only in the number of men, but in physique, and especially in moral. The men are as cheerful and earnest in their duty as volunteers. The reinforcements we are sending forward will give as good an account of themselves as any that have left Canada.&quot;Men of Military Age. A notice has been issued by the Military Service Branch of the Department of Justice to the effect that every man in Canada who is apparently of military age must have with him at all times papers to prove that he is not a deserter under the Military Service Act. Otherwise he is liable to a fine of $50, and may be drafted into the Canadian Army.Nationalisation of Railways. The Press of the Dominion is commenting a great deal upon the Government scheme for acquiring the Grand Trunk Railway (vide Report No. 69). In discussing the negotiations which are to take place between the Government and the Grank Trunk directors, the Montreal Gazette says : &quot; The Government having resolved to constitute into a State-owned system all the chief railways of Canada, with the exception of the Canadian Pacific, and the principal obstacle being one of price in respect of the Grand Trunk, there is little room for doubt left that a bargain will be made, and less that such a bargain should have regard to the future credit of Canada in the British money market as well as to the interest of the Grand Trunk shareholders, who invested their money because of their strong belief in the future of- the country and in the good faith of its Govern-ment. There should iu all fairness, when the terms of the purchase come to be fixed, -be full consideration of the service rendered by the Grand Trunk in the early clevelopment of the Old Provinces of Canada, and of its valuable work during the past four years under the strain of the adverse conditions created by the war, and a fair estimate should be made of its future value.&quot; The Toronto World and the Toronto Globe argue that the Great North-Western Telegraph Company is a subsidiary company to the Canadian Northern Railway, and that the lines should be taken over and operated by the Dominion Government.An announcement has been made by the Chairman of the Arbitration Board (Sir William Meredith) that the Board has fixed $10,800,000 as the price&apos; which the Dominion should pay for 600,000 shares in the stock of the Canadian Northern Railway, which is being taken over by the country.
oNext War Loan. An announcement has appeared in the Press that the Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White) is already making preparations for the next War Loan, which will he issued in October or November. A meeting was held on May 30th of the members of the Dominion Executive Committee in charge of the last loan, when plans were discussed for strengthening the organisation amf covering thoroughly the whole country.Indians and Military Service, The Indian Chief, Delisle, speaking recently at a gathering of Indians at Caughnawaga claimed that as the Indians had no right to vote they should not be forced to light under the Military Service Act, The Chief declared that of 1 10,000. Indians in Canada 8,000 had gone to fight the Germans vohmtarilv,A P ST I LA LI A N C OM M ON WEALTH.Monroe Doctrine for Pacific. Following upon his visit to President Wilson, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth delivered an important speech in New York on May 31st in which, according, to cabled reports sent by News Agencies, he appealed to the United States to support the Commonwealth in maintaining a Monroe doctrine for the. South Pacific. He said, &quot; the United States cannot he&quot; destroyed, but this war means life or death to Australia, Australia looks to you to stand bv her in war and peace. If we are to continue free we must have guarantees against enemy aggressions in the future, and this involves an Australasian Monroe doctrine in the South Pacific. &apos; Hands off the Pacific &apos; is the doctrine to which by inexorable circumstances we are committed against all predatory nations. AYe will, strive to give this doctrine effect to tlie last ounce of effort at our disposal.&quot;In. one of the cabled reports Mr. Hughes is stated to have declared that Australia was determined that the islands which formerly belonged to Germany in the Paciiic should &quot; belong to Australia or to some friendly Power.&quot;Progress of Recruiting. -For the week ending May 25th the recruiting was slightly better than the average for the year, but the enrolments were below the previous week&apos;s figures.Leader of Opposition and. Recruiting.- -The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor), speaking at a recruiting meeting last week, said that nobody regretted, more than he having to call upon Australia and other parts of the Empire to make a further effort to end the awful struggle, but he did not. believe in pulling out and allowing the other side to win.Soldiers&apos; National Political Party. A. demonstration to encourage recruiting and to give effect to the Resolutions passed at the Governor-Generals Conference has been arranged by the Soldiers&apos; National Political Party.War Loan Pill, The Commonwealth House of Representatives have passed the 80,000,000/. War Loan Bill.It is reported in the Press that the statement of the Acting Prime Minister (Air. Watt) thai, the money should be raised locally for meeting the above annual expenditure on (lie war has received the support of the principal political and financial interests.Parliament and Prayer for Soldiers and Sailors. The House of Representatives has adopted a report of the Standing Orders Committee to include a prayer for the soldiers and sailors of the Empire in the opening prayer. The concluding words are &quot; Give them speedy victory over their enemies, and grant that an honourable and lasting peace may result from their valour and sacrifices.&quot;Instil ate of Science and Industry. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) after discussing arrangements with the Assistant Minister of the Board of Trade and with the Executive of the Institute of Science and Industry regarding the future of the Institute, has promised to introduce a Bill next session providing for the permanent constitution of the Institute and to determine the powers of the directorate and the functions of State Councils. It will be remembered that the Institute was part of the scheme of trade organization outlined recently by Mr. Hughes (vide Report No. 41 and No. 54).- .- A. 2  A
Trades Unions and Anti-War Element. The first Conference of the recently formed Labour Federation in. New South&apos; Wales, embracing the more moderate trades unions which broke [away as the result of the domination of anti-war extremists (vide Report - No. 70) has been called for June 15th, in the manifesto to trade unionists the Federation states that the recent attitude of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council is contrary to the real sentiment of unionism. The Trades Hall position iu New South Wales regarding the attitude of the Unions towards recruiting is becoming more complicated.   There are now three distinct factions.Visit of Editors to Great Britain. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) replying to a. question in the House regarding the proposed visit of editors to Great Britain/said he wanted to see a fair representation of the Labour Press. He added, amid laughter, that he believed the Labour representatives needed more education than the other side.Queensland Parliament. The Queensland State Parliament was opened on May 28th, when 14 sat on the Government side of the House of Assembly and 22 on the Opposition side. In the GovefnoFs speech the following were amongst, the measures indicated for the coming Session, viz. :   Health Amendment Bill, Popular Initiative and Referendum Bill, and Election Amendment Bill.SOUTH AFRICA.Arrival of Mr. Burton in London. The Hon. U. Burton, M.L.A.,&apos;Union Minister of Railways and Harbours, arrived in London on the afternoon of June 5th for the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet and Conference.   .Recruiting for Royal Air Force. The Union Government&apos; have informed the British Government that the recruiting tour for the Royal Air Force has been most successful. They point out, however, that besides those already enlisted there arc many others available, and that, unless the opportunity of enrolling the latter is seized, the enthusiasm now in existence may slacken. As the delay in getting recruits transported to England is adversely affecting the recruiting, the Union Ministers suggest that a preliminary training should be given in South Africa while the men are awaiting transport.INDIA.(Excluding external affairs, ultuli arc dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Local Self-Government. The outlines of the policy of the Government of India regarding a system of more complete local self-government have appeared in a Renter&apos;s message to the Press. The policy includes an increased elective element, a lower and wider franchise, and more elected unofficial chairmen, responsible for the control of taxes, budgets, and the employees of municipalities and local boards. It is pointed out in the message that the recommendations represent the first instalment of a tripartite scheme, the other parts being the &quot; Iudianisation &quot; of the services and constitutional reforms.Temporary Commissions for Indians. The Secretary of State for India has communicated his views to the War Cabinet regarding the grant, of temporary commissions to Indians. After pointing out that during his recent visit to India it was agreed by those responsible that 500,000 serviceable fighting men could be raised, he mentions that it was considered that recruits should be assured that if they entered the ranks as privates and fought their way by valour in the Field, and hy gaining the confidence of their fellow-soldiers, access to the commissioned ranks should be.open to them, ddiis proposal would be for the term of the war only and would be inapplicable to peace conditions. The Government of India unanimously fixed the number of commissioned officers at 200, spread over a period of two years, some of the commissions being allotted to Indian gentlemen who could not be expected, on account of their traditions and civilisation, to enlist in the ranks and who3 --r--/...,.i.,,-,-,v..;;----.    ::v :   &quot; ,      :-7T-:       - :-       -     - ----- -&apos; --3?,-,-- ---..r&quot;
would therefore be trained in Gadet Corps. The Secretary of State expresses the view that a refusal to grant temporary King&apos;s Commissions would have a deplorable result on the war spirit of India.Results of Delhi Conference. Some of the results of the Delhi Conference have been communicated to the Press as follows : &quot; The Rajah of Kollangod, presiding over a loan and recruiting meeting at. Oalieut, appealed to the Malayalis for men and money. Five thousand pounds was-: subscribed. The Zemindar of Etaiyapuram at Koilpatti promised to recruits from his zemindari the remission of rent up to five rupees for 10 years, and assignments to landless men. One thousand pounds was subscribed. The Madras Government is considering the surrender of further officers for military service. At the request of the talukdars (revenue officers)sof Oudh, recruiting for three companies of Rajputs, Brahmans, and Musulmans is to be ripened immediately, with depots at Lucknow, Eyzabad, and Sitapur. As recruiting expands these companies will be raised to battalions. The United Provinces&apos; Man-Power Sub-Committee has proposed the formation of a local Militia. As the proposal met with opposition by the Defence Force, the sub-committee recommended the Government to enrol men over 30 to assist the police in preventing lawlessness, as a feeling of unrest and insecurity is abroad.&quot;Indian Scditionists and Russia. The &quot;European Central Committee of t,he Hindu Nationalists&quot; have telegraphed to the United Mussulman Congresses at Kazan regarding national self-determination and British rule. The following passages occur in this communication : &quot;We, Hindus, welcome the courageous effort of Russian Mussulmans In favour of the oppressed nations of Asia and Africa. By demanding from the Provisional Government of free Russia a decided and logical policy with the object of recognising that the peoples of Asia and Africa, as well as those of Europe, have a uniform right to full national self-determination, the Russian Mussulmans have done great good to the cause of &quot;humanity. . . . The population of India, numbering 315 millions, and ruthlessly enslaved and exploited by England under the eyes of the Old and. the New Worlds, indefatigably directs its forces to the attainment of full national independence, knowing at the same time that with its liberation will collapse the strongest pillar of Imperialism. Generally speaking, the solidarity of all Eastern peoples, as well as support from Russia, who triumphantly renounced the Imperialism of the old regime, will help to hasten the process of the political revival of the East.&quot;The Executive Committee of the All-Russian Mussulman Council replied expressing hearty thanks to the &quot;representatives of Great India,&quot; and expressed their confidence &quot; that the clearing storm of the world-war will open a new page in the historical life of the peoples of the East, and will lead to their cultural and political revival.&quot;FOREIGN COLONIES.GERMANY IN AFRICA AND THE PACIFIC.Economic Value of German Colonies. -The following estimates of the value of the colonies possessed by Germany at the outbreak of the war are taken hy the Norddeulsche Allgemeine Zeitung (April 22nd, 1918) from figures supplied to Dcr Xropenpflansev by E. Kienitz, who based them on detailed calculations as to the value of the land, buildings, stocks of cattle, yield of mines, trade, industry, &amp;c. :  New Guinea, estimated value, Mk. 1,293 mill. Samoa, estimated value, Mk. 99 mill.German South-West Africa, estimated value, Mk. 1,609 mill. Togoland, estimated value, Mk. 110 mill. Cameroon, estimated value, Mk. 565 mill. German East Africa, estimated value, Mk. S42 mill.Of this total value of. more than Mk.. 4  milliards, mining claims the largest share, viz., Mk. 2,356 mill., followed by forests Mk. 293 mill., wild animals and fish
Mk..55 mill., land owned by natives Mk. 229 mill., live stocks Mk.&apos;259 milk, European concerns Mk. 424 mill., commerce Mk. 284 milk, railways Mk. 419 milk, Govern -ment buildings Mk. 200 mill. In reality, however, it is pointed out the money value of the colonies is considerably greater, for no estimate has been made of the development of raw materials. How great this may be in tropical Africa is shown, it is stated, by the example of the English Gold Coast, in which the production of cocoa, valued in 1891 at 80/., in 1917 reached the huge sum of 200/.. mill.New Markets in Africa.-Professor Dove, writing in the Frankfurter Zeituna (May 19th, 1918) on &quot;Africa and the European Trade,&quot; refers to the anxiety to find new markets after the war, and points out that not America, but Africa, will supply the need. He surveys briefly the main factors railroads, raw materials, cattle. &amp;c--and the possibilities of further development. In ^particular, he observes that the eastern plateau could feed over 100,000,000 head of cattle, which, of course, would not be under the control of American companies.   The significance of this, he says,.&apos; is obvious when one considers the calculations of English companies that meat could be sent from Rhodesia to London by the Cape to Cairo railway more quickly, by at least a week, than from the Argentine. He continues, &quot; a comparison of the imports-shows that, if we take the least civilised lands, the semi-civilised, and those which are essentially European, the imports amount per head to Mk. 4.44, 18.44, and 89.29 respiectively. The significance of culture for the economic life of Africa could not be more clearly shown, and the figures prove the enormous value of the presence of the civilised areas in the African tropics. If we assume the whole of Africa to import goods at the same rate as the essentially European districts where alone there are the beginnings of a European trade in our sense of the word the total would amount. to twelve milliard marks, of which Germany may hope to have a consilerable sliare in the near future.&quot;German need of Colonial Empire. In the course of the Debate in the German Reichstag on the Colonial Budget last month, Herr Stohinann (National-Liberal),, emphasised Germany&apos;s need of African colonies, and maintained that she needed her possessions in the South Seas. &quot;We must have &quot; he said, &quot; a great Colonial Empire-at all costs.&quot;German Native Policy in East Africa. German Wireless calls attention to an article on German policy towards the natives appearing in the Berlin Eokalanzeicjer by the wife of the Governor of German East Africa. It is stated that the writer is an English woman fry birth and has had a wide experience of conditions in British and German Colonies. The article, it is stated, confirms the fact that the British &quot; principle of leaving colonies to develop themselves is only good and feasible when-the spirit of enterprise has already been brought into the colony by Europeans. Where it is a question of the native population, the German policy towards the-natives was -very successful and beneficial. The natives, who combine with the mentality of children the keen instincts of animals, appreciate the &quot;attitude which is taken towards them. For this reason the confidence of the natives has been the i,- the foundation stone of the whole of our policy. In East Africa the natives have been treated justly by the Germans. They were all paid for their services, and were-pirotected from exploitation. This they felt and understood. Under Belgian and * British rule the natives were pressed into service as carriers and Askaris. Therefore, it is not surprising to hear that they look back with longing to the days of German rule.&quot; . . . &quot; The natives in Portuguese East Africa and in Rhodesia applied to Governor Schnoe at the outbreak of war asking to be taken under German rule, and to be allowed to take part in the war on Germany s side. It was, of course, impossible to-cornply with their desire. But even now when our troops have been obliged to. evacuate German East Africa, the natives in Portuguese East Africa stand by them, in spite of the enemy&apos;s superiority.&quot;
