SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERAL-REPORT No. 59.PART I.   BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.The arrangements regarding shipments from the United States to the Dominions afford an examine of the extent to which the trading interests of the great Dominions bring them into close relationship with Foreign Powers.This is further emphasised in the matter of control of Foreign Shipping. The Commonwealth of Australia welcomes the course suggested by the British authorities ; the South African Ministers desire fuller information about the effect likely to be produced upon the trade of the Union with Japan.The increasing trade of Australia with Japan and the United States and the French Mission to Australia are of interest in this connection.Canada.The firm attitude adopted by the Government in their policy of prohibiting the manufacture of intoxicating liquor in the Dominions is shown in this Report,The Union Ministers agree with the British proposals about enemy trading after the war.Having regard to the interest taken in the Dominion in the care of soldiers on leave, the Report on Canadian soldiers in London is important.A ustealtan  COMM on wealth.The enquiry of the Commonwealth Government about the position of the Leaders of the Opposition at the forthcoming gathering of Dominion Ministers in London is important.Elections for the State Parliaments in Queensland and South Australia will shortly be taking place. The former is the only State in the Commonwealth where a purely Labour Government remains in power. This Report shows the manner in which the Queensland Labour Government have come into conflict with the Federal authorities. Other matters connected with State politics deserve attention.The attitude of official Labour in the Commonwealth towards the War and the
Empire is indicated in the Appendix to this Report. This may help to clear up some misconceptions which have arisen.New Zealand.Another statement from Mr. Massey serves to keep the views of the Dominion on Pacific questions weU to the fore.South Africa.It seems doubtful whether General Botha will be able to attend the forthcoming meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet,The references to proposals for the incorporation of Rhodesia in the Union should be noted.G.

PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND  AFRICA.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.United States Shipments. The Governments of the Australian Commonwealth, the Dominion of New Zealand and the Union of South Africa have doeen informed that, owing to transport difficulties, the United States Government will not issue export licences for shipments to Allied countries, whether purchased by Governments or private individuals, unless permission to purchase has been first obtained from the United States Purchasing Commission. It is intended to refuse such permission to private firms unless the order is certified as essential by the Allied Government concerned, and unless tonnage is likely to be available. In order to meet the wishes of the United States, the British Government have decided to prohibit all imports from that country except under permit and to notify private purchasers that they must obtain a permit from the British Government before placing any order in the United States. The approved importers will then communicate with the United States exporters who will have to obtain the necessary authority from the Purchasing Commission.In connection with Dominion purchases, the above-mentioned Dominion Govern-ments have been informed that it is not intended to interfere with existing procedure in regard to Government purchases, but with reference to private purchases it is necessary to arrange either that orders must be passed through a Certifying Authority in the Dominion, the American Board and the Interallied Council, or that arrangements should be made similar to those outlined above for the United Kingdom. The views of Ministers are invited upon the subject, and it is indicated that the British Government favour the first alternative in view of the exchange situation.Allied Protection of Fishing Vessels. The Governments of Canada and New-foundland have been informed of the results of a Conference, representative of the interests of Canada, Newfoundland and France, which has recently been held to consider the best method of Allied co-operation for the protection of fishing vessels on Newfoundland Banks, in view of hostile submarines. The Conference recom-mended that the assistance of the British Government, the United States and Canada should be asked in order to protect the fisheries by patrol vessels. For this purpose it was suggested that the vessels engaged in fishing duties should keep in groups, with four protecting vessels off the United States of America Banks, and a similar number off the Newfoundland Bank and Nova Scotia respectively. The aim would be that patrol vessels of each nationality should be available in each area. Owing to the increased size of the radius of action of submarines, it w7as considered that the danger existed mainly Avhere the shipping grounds were crossed by steamer routes. The Governments of Canada and Newfoundland have been asked to give the Admiralty their views upon the matter, and the Admiralty have suggested that as they will not be able to supply the vessels required, an arrangement should be made that they may be furnished by the United States, Canada and Newfoundland.CANADA.Enemy Trading after the Wan.-In reply to a telegram from the British Govern-ment on the subject of the Most-Favoured-Nation clauses in British commercial treaties (vide Report No. 58, under &quot; Imperial Affairs &quot;), the Dominion Government have telegraphed that they have no objection to the course proposed.Dominion Debt and War Expenditure. At the end of February 1918 the total gross debt of the Dominion was $1,906,393,350, while the total assets were $985,612,889. The total War expenditure for the 11 months of the present financial year amounted to over 207 million dollars, but the revenue showed an increase of nearly 4 millions over the corresponding period of last year.
French Canadians and the Cabinet.-With regard to the statement made in the last Report as to the resignation of Mr. Sevigny (Minister of Inland Revenue) owing to this defeat at the polls, it is stated that the resignation has not yet been accepted by the Prime Minister. It appears that both Mr. Sevigny and Colonel Blondin (Postmaster-General), wdio was also defeated at the recent election, are still Cabinet Ministers, but it is anticipated that a definite announcement on the subject of their position will be made shortly. Meantime it is to be noted that one of the principal French newspapers in Montreal, La Patrie, makes the following comment: &quot;The &quot; English Provinces are probably astonished that French-Canadians accept,, with &quot; complete resignation, the loss of their representatives in the Ministry. They may &quot; be equally astonished to see our complete submission to the military law, which our &quot; people fought with so much energy.&quot;Government Prohibition Policy. The Dominion Government have prohibited the manufacture of intoxicating liquor in Canada except for mechanical and medicinal purposes after April 1st. The only exceptions relate to the manufacture of Ontario native wine, and to Quebec beer of over 2\ per cent, proof until December 31st next. The Order-in-Council also prohibits the transportation of liquor to any Province wdhch forbids the sale of liquor. In the latter connection, all the Provinces now have prohibition except Quebec, where it will come into operation later on. The Federal Order will operate during the war and one year after. With regard to the prohibition policy of the Government a deputation representing the, brewers of the country waited upon the War Cabinet, and presented a demand for com-pensation in respect of losses which they stated would result from the Government policy. They also urged that a standard drink consisting of 2-g- per cent, alcohol should be defined as beer.In connection with this subject the President of the Privy Council (Mr. X. W. TOnvell) stated in a recent speech that representations had been made from influential quarters urging the Government to modify its prohibition policy, but he said that, after giving due consideration to these, the Prime Minister saw no adequate reason for altering the policy announced. Mr. Powell stated that the Government did not give particular attention to the alcoholic contents of liquor which would be deemed intoxicating, but that it had been found that in practically all the Provinces of the Dominion legislation had been passed adopting 21 per cent, proof as a standard. He said that he believed the proposed legislation of the Government came well within the War Measures Act, and that the practical benefits would be so great that public opinion would demand that the Government should continue to enforce the measure even after the war period. Mr. Powell further pointed out that the Government, action came at one of the most critical hours of the war, and, moreover, at a time when the Government were calling upon the people of Canada to give &quot; their best  &quot; their sons, food products, munitions, ships, so that when democracy meets autocracy &quot; in the final conflict autocracy will be overthrown and a free democracy triumph.&apos;&apos;Dominion Soldiers in London. An official Report upon the matter of the care of Canadiau soldiers in London, to which the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) made reference when in consultation with British Ministers last year, has been published in the Dominion. This Report states : &quot; The existing organisations provide every &quot; conceivable counter-attraction to the lure of the streets, and the only man who &quot; gets into trouble in London to-day is the man who will find his way into trouble &quot; anywhere.&quot;In view of the attitude adopted by the Women&apos;s Delegation regarding the sale of intoxicating liquors in the United Kingdom (vide Report No. 58) the following-passage in the Report is of interest: &quot;Though the sale of alcoholic drink is &quot;enormously restricted by law, though treating is forbidden and drunkenness has &quot; decreased almost to vanishing point, and though the efforts of what is probably &quot; the most efficient police system of the world have worked wonders in the repression &quot; of temptations to vice, it would be folly to suggest that a man who goes looking-for trouble cannot find it in London.&quot;Nova Scotia and Woman Franchise. It has been proposed to amend the Nova Scotia Franchise. Bill by introducing a clause granting the suffrage to women. The result would be that both male and female adults would be able to exercise the franchise ; and it is anticipated that very little opposition will be offered to the proposed amendment.
Flax for AeropIanes.-0\\&apos;mg to the demands of the Admiralty and War Office for the supply of flax to he used in the production of aeroplane linen fabric, and the necessity of reducing dependence on the Russian and Dutch supplies of seed the British Government have proposed to the Dominion that contracts should he made with the Western farmers to sow flax seed, and deliver the product of acreage sown at a guaranteed price.Supply of Molybdenum. The Colonisation Agent of the Grand Trunk Pacific has issued an official statement, to ihe effect that there is more Molybdenum in Western Canada than in all other countries together. Manitoba has, he states, large deposits east of Winnipeg still untouched.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Imperial War Conference. The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) has telegraphed that as it is reported in the local Press that the Leader of the Opposition&quot;(Sir W. Laurie]-) is accompanying the Prime Minister of Canada in order to attend the forth-coming meetings of the Imperial War Conference, efforts are being made to induce the Commonwealth Government to invite the Leader of the Opposition in the Federal Parliament (Mr. Tudor) to accompany Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cook to England. The Prime Minister therefore asks for information regarding the report about the Canadian representatives. In reply, Mr. Hughes has been informed that no suggestion has been made to the British Government that Sir W. Laurier should accompany Sir R. Borden. It is added that two or more of the Canadian Prime Ministers colleagues will accompany him.Control of Foreign SIiipping.-As to the suggested co-operation with the United States regarding arrangements for the more effective control of foreign shipping engaged in trade outside the war zone (vide Report No. 57), the Commonwealth Government have telegraphed that arrangements had already been made for the control of cargo of ships loading on the berth, but the absence of a settled policy interfered with the desired results. The Government therefore gladly welcome the suggested co-operation and believe that regulations can be issued under the Common-wealth War Precautions Act.French Mission to the CommonwealtJi. -At the invitation of the Commonwealth Government, a French Mission will shortly be proceeding to Australia to consider various outstanding matters, mainly of a commercial and scientific character, that affect the two countries. The Mission will be representative of the French Govern-ment, the Army, Agricultural Science, and the Press. The commercial negotiations with France are considered of great importance to the Commonwealth on account of the loss of. the German market and for other reasons.Financial Arrangements for War Purposes. The Acting Treasurer of the commonwealth (Mr. W. A. Watt) has announced that he hopes to raise 40,000,000L by the present War Loan. The Banks have agreed to finance clients to the extent of 90 per cent, of bonds applied for at 4 per cent, interest, the advance to be repaid in 18 months.   The Banks do not require any security other than War Bonds or Stock.Mr. Watt has further announced that Australia has raised within her own borders in the last three-and-a-half years the sum of 101,000,000&apos;-., the loan expenditure for wrar purposes being now over 80,000,000L annually.Trade with Japan and United States. -The Commonwealth trade statistics for 1917 show a large increase of imports from Japan and the United States and a diminution of imports from the United Kingdom.&quot;Relumed Soldiers. The New South Wales Minister for Lands has recently purchased 3,493 acres in the Northern districts at prices ranging from 51. 5s. to about 131. an acre for the settlement of returned soldiers, and the authority of Parliament is being asked for further purchases.The Victorian Government since 1910 have bought 15,251 acres at a cost of over 2,000L for the settlement of discharged soldiers. The Minister for Lands of Victoria has just announced that under his Laud Repatriation Scheme, applicants must pass a capabilities test as the benefits are largely limited to those with previous farming-experience.  He stated that &quot; it is impracticable to train large numbers of soldiers on
oshort notice for fanning,&quot; and added that only 7 per.cent, of soldier applicants have had previous experience in wheat farming. The Victorian Closer Settlement Board will have 700 irrigation blocks ready in two months&apos; time.In Queensland the &quot;Discharged Soldiers&apos; Settlement Act&quot; gives the Minister power to set apart any Crown land for the purpose of soldiers&apos; settlement, and already three large areas have been so appropriated. Under this Act the term &quot; discharged soldier &quot; applies to Australians, but may be extended so as to include members&quot; of His Majest.y&apos;s forces, during the present war, from any part of the British Umpire, or members of Allied forces, who have been discharged before arriving in Queensland.The Returned Sailors&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Imperial League has decided to ask the Commonwealth Government to pass a Bill to recognise the League as an official organisation for returned men. The League has recommended the Defence Depart-ment. to comb out all fit men from the Australian bases abroad.--At a meeting held in Melbourne it was agreed that 200 soldiers belonging to the National Party should assist the Government in dealing with soldiers&apos; problems.Commonwealth Police, and Queensland. The action of the Queensland Police in refusing to arrest an Irishman who had assaulted Mr. Hughes on his  political visit to Warwick (vide Report No. 56) was the direct cause of the creation of the Common-wealth Police Force. As pointed out in the above-mentioned Report, Mr. Hughes called on the Premier of Queensland (Mr. Ryan) to remove the police officer who had failed to obey his direction. Mr. Ryan, however, refused to do this, and a special body of Commonwealth, police was thereupon immediately created and a number of them sent to Queensland, in announcing the decision of the Commonwealth Ministry. Mr. Hughes said that the warrant of the Commonwealth would run throughout the country in both loyal States and disloyal States, but the Commonwealth would only place their police in the State which, he alleged, was disloyal.Queensland Flections. At the Queensland State Elections on March 16th, all the seats in- the Legislative Assembly will be contested. Twenty returned soldiers are standing for election in the Nationalist interest, and the Labour Premier (Mr. Ryan) is himself being opposed by a returned soldier. The elections are being fought with vigour on both sides, and the war is occupying a large share of attention in the campaign. Mr. Ryan, and his followers have pledged themselves to assist in a light to a finish.Queensland Upper House. While the policy of the Nationalist Party in Queens-land is, as announced in the last Report, to make the Upper House elective, the Labour Governments policy is to abolish the Legislative Council altogether. Indeed, a Bill to abolish the Upper House was introduced by the Government in 1915, and having been rejected in that year and again in the following year by the Legislative Council, the Government, in accordance with the Parliamentary Bills Referendum Act of 1908, referred the matter to the people. Meantime members of the Legislative Council determined to contest the power of the Lower House and the people to abolish their bothy, and they brought an action against the Government to restrain them From proceeding with the Referendum. Though the Full Court of Queensland decided in favour of the members of the Upper House mainly on the ground that any alteration in the Constitution of the nature contemplated should be made by the Imperial Parliament, an appeal to the High Court of Australia reversed this decision. In the Referendum, however, a majority voted against the Bill ; but the whole question of the powers of the Legislative Assembly and the people to abolish the Upper House is shortly to come before the Privy Council in London. The decision there given will be of importance as affecting the powers of other Parliaments in the Empire.Labour Policy in Victoria. It should be noted in connection with the above that one of the principal items in the programme of the Official Labour Party of the State of Victoria is the institution of one legislative body as the State Parliament in place of the two Houses that at present exist. Another item in the Victorian Labour programme is the abolition of the office of State Governor as at present constituted, and the substitution of a &quot; local appointee.&quot;South Australian Dissolution. The Governor has dissolved the South Australian State Parliament, and the elections will take place  on April 6th.    The present
Ministry is  a  coalition  of Liberals  and National Labour,  and   this combinati will &quot;contest  the forthcoming  election  as the  National  Party in  opposition the Official Labour Party.NEW ZEALAND.Samoa as the Key to South Pacific. The Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) again voiced the opinion of the Dominion regarding the importance of Samoa from a strategic standpoint, when he made the following statement in a speech delivered on March 7th, viz. : &quot; Our interest does not lie in the fertility or productiveness of the island, &quot; but in the fact that we are anxious because Samoa is the key to the South Pacific, &quot; and if restored to Germany would become the headquarters of a German Fleet and &quot; the centre of German operations in the Pacific. The British flag was carried away &quot;from Samoa in 1889, and the New Zealand boys carried it back again in. 1914. My &quot; opinion and hope are that it went back to stay.&quot;SOUTH AFRICA.General Botha and Imperial War Cabinet. The Prime Minister of the Union (General Botha) has telegraphed that he has considerable doubt as to whether he ought to visit : England in June. He observes that if it were a question of a Peace Conference, everything would give way, but local reasons make it inadvisable that both he and General Smuts should be away after the Session. If General Botha cannot attend, it is stated that General Smuts would represent South Africa, but further information will be telegraphed later.Control of Foreign Shipping. As to the telegram from the British Government regarding co-operation in the control of Foreign Shipping (vide under &quot;Australian Commonwealth&quot; in. this Report and under &quot;Imperial. Affairs&quot; in Report No. 57) the Union Government point out that the general plan suggested would, if applied to Japanese ships now trading at Union ports, apparently stop all exports from South Africa to Japan. The Union Ministers, therefore, ask for fuller information before they can say whether they will be in a position to co-operate.Nationalists and the Budget. The Nationalists moved an amendment to the Budget in the House of Assembly which would have the effect of referring the estimates to a Select Committee:   The amendment, however, was defeated by 71 votes to 20.I ih odes la and the Union. The Treasurer &quot;of Southern Rhodesia (Mr. P. J. Newton) in addressing the Agricultural Congress at Bulawayo spoke of the danger of a possible &quot;premature&quot; inclusion of Rhodesia in the Union of South Africa. &quot;I have just been to the Cape,&quot; he added, &quot;and I there heard things which &quot; indicate that this is not such a remote contingency as we had hoped.&quot; The-Treasurer expressed the belief that Rhodesians would prefer Rhodesia to remain as it was until it had achieved its destiny. Mr. Duthie, an ex-Director of Education, on the other hand, affirmed that Rhodesians would not object to the absorption - of Rhodesia in the Union, provided they could continue to control their own domestic affairs, such, for instance, as those relating to education, bi-lingualism, and kindred matters.THE PACIFIC.- Australia, Japan and German Pacific Colonies. In a recent lecture at Sydney, the Japanese Cohsul-General stated that Japan as well as Australia and New Zealand strongly desired that the German Colonies should not be given back to Germany as, if they were, the peace of the Pacific could not be regarded as secure.
APPENDIXTOWestern and General Report No. 59.   Part I.THE   AUSTRALIAN   LABOUR   PARTY   AND   THE   EMPIRE.The position of the Official Labour Party and its supporters in Australia in relation to the war and the Empire is not always capable of correct appreciation, and the references which will be given below may assist in elucidating the Labour attitude and illustrating the extent to which this fundamentally differs from that adopted by the Nationalist Party.POSITION OF PARTIES.rarli.cs in the Commonwealth. It is necessary to recall-that as a result of the double dissolution which took place shortly after the present war had commenced, Mr. Hughes &quot;had a majority ol Labour followers in both Houses of the Federal Parliament over his Liberal opponents, and it was not until after his return to Australia in August 1916 that his proposals for oversea compulsory service caused a split in the Labour ranks, which restdted in his being able to continue in office with the minority of his Labour supporters purely by means of the support he derived from the Liberal party under Mr. Cook. The large Labour Opposition, however, in the Upper House soon rendered the continuance of this state of affairs impossible, with the result that Mr. Hughes and his followers formed a coalition with the liberals, and the present Nationalist Party was the result. The General Election of 1917 confirmed Mr. Hughes in office and provided him aud his Nationalist followers with a majority of practically 2 to 1 in the Federal House of Representatives, and a large majority in the Senate.Parties in the Slates. The issue of conscription and its immediate effect upon Federal politics exercised its influence upon the position of politics in the various States of the Commonwealth. For example, in New South - Wales, the Nationalist Party, under Mr. Holm an, are in power with a majority of about 20 in the Lower House of 90 members, and also a majority in the Upper House.Similarly, in South zVustralia, after-various vicissitudes, a coalition Ministry of half Liberals and half National-Labour was formed, and these sections are now contesting the present Election in that State as the National Party in opposition to Official Labour. The last-named Party is at present only represented in both Houses by about six Members ; but these Members can scarcely be said to represent the strength of the Party in the country where the bulk of normal Labour votes organised by the Trade Unions probably support Official Labour. This estimate will be tested at the forthcoming General Election on April 6th.Again, in Western Australia, the Government are supported by the National Party, and in a House of 50 Members the Official Labour Party has about 15 representatives, the rest being either Liberal or Labour-Nationalists of somewhat varying types.In Tasmania there is a Liberal Government in power, while the Independent Liberals (or &quot; Economy &quot; Party) are in the position of authority in Victoria.Queensland, therefore, is the only State which possesses at the moment an Official Labour conrplexion, and this of course may receive some alteration at the elections on March 16th ; but it is in respect of this State that a good many controversies of a somewhat acrimonious character have taken place between Federal and State Authorities. For example, on the question of Conscription, the Queensland Labour party  finding that the new regulations of the Commonwealth had the effect of suppressing the circulation of certain anti-conscription pamphlets, arranged a day in the Legislative Assembly (where the reports of the proceedings were privileged) for52o7-2n
the reading of all the censored matter. These being printed in &quot; Hansard &quot; could be issued throughout the country ; but letters sent by the Queensland Anti-Co n-scription Committee to men with German names and others, spoke of &quot; arrangements &quot; being made to read the statements and so get them circulated throughout the &quot; country &quot; and, on the scheme being exposed, the Commonwealth Authorities seized the thousands of copies of &quot; Hansard&quot; before they could be issued. In these publications the arguments against conscription many of which had been censored outside were black-leaded. This incident was naturally used con-siderably throughout the recent Conscription Referendum campaign, the Federal Government being accused of &quot; Prussianism &quot; and. the Queensland Government of disloyalty.Indeed, the open accusation of disloyalty made by the Federal authorities was used as an argument for the creation of a Commonwealth Police Force (vide this Report under &quot;Australian Commonwealth&quot;). Owing to the refusal of the Queensland State authorities to arrest one of the rioters at Warwick during the visit of Mr. Hughes, in the course of the Conscription Referendum campaign, Commonwealth police were sent up to Queensland in order, in Mr. Hughes&apos; words, to see that the Federal laws, which&quot;over-ride those of the State, were carried into effect.ATTITUDE   TOWARDS   THE   WAR.Federal Labour Policy. The two great questions which have agitated Australia and which, it may be said, the Official Labour Party have utilised to the full in order to oust the Nationalists from power, have been Conscription and Industrialism. The Official Labour Party, however, led by Mr. Tudor in the Federal House of Repre-sentatives, strongly repudiate any suggestions of disloyalty with regard to either matter.As to conscription and the &quot; win-the-war &quot; policy, Mr. TudoFs official pronounce-ment of April 1917 contained this assertion: &quot;The present Government has &quot; absolutely no right to call itself the &apos; Win-the-war &apos; Government, as the Labour Party &quot;is just as anxious to win the war as any member of the present Government or &quot; those who support it,&quot; and it was in relation to the specific proposal of compulsory service for oversea that Official Labour fell foul of the Nationalist programme.Though in so considerable a minority in the Federal Parliament at the present time, it cannot be denied that the Official Labour Party secured a large measure of the support for their anti-conscription programme in the recent Referendum which &quot;would normally have been given to the Nationalists. To take only one example, in New South Wales, 11 purely Liberal seats which returned a majority for the Nationalist Party at the General Election of 80,106, at the Referendum, returned a majority for anti-conscription of 26,412, or, in other words, an increase to Labour of 106,508 votes, in constituencies which were Liberal until a few months before.It may therefore be said that, though the Labour Party may receive some of their support from disloyalists, there is a strong probability that a large number of voters, who could not in any way be described as disloyal, voted against the Nationalists on the conscription issue, with the full knowledge before them that their action might bring Official Labour into power, for Mr. Hughes had pledged his Government to resign if defeated at the Referendum. It is not necessary to discuss here the various influences such as Sinn Feinism, Industrialism (in which term may be included the attitude of those labour interests who were desirous of conserving Australians labour supply before all else), and the personal animosities which led to the defeat of conscription at the Referendum in December last, but this matter was referred to in Report No. 48.In connection with the industrial question, however, it is important to observe that the great industrial upheaval, which sprang from the New South Wales strike in August last, was seized upon by the Labour Party as a means of attacking the National Government.It would no doubt be unfair to attempt to identify the extremists of the Independent Workers of the World persuasion with the Australian Official Labour Party, and Mr. Tudor indeed observed in his official statement of last year, in referring to the Referendum and election campaigns, that &quot; the bogey that was most serviceable to our opponents was the I. WAV. bogey.&quot;   Yet it cannot be gainsaid that one of the main
causes of the strikes was au attempt by the extremists and disloyalists in the Trade Unions to attack constitutional government and render it practically impossible.Ostensibly, the strikes arose through the introduction of the &quot; card system &quot; in order to speed up work in the New South Wales railway workshops ; but even this was a matter of controversy between the parties. The attitude of the Nationalists and the Official Labour Party may be shown most clearly by the following extracts from a discussion winch took place in the Tlouse of Representatives upon the industrial crisis on September 6th last. In moving the adjournment of the House to consider the subject, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) said : &quot;It has been stated by *&apos; honourable members in this House and elsewhere that the present trouble is political, &quot; and not industrial. That statement is absolutely wrong. Idle men in New South-&quot; Wales have gone on strike as a protest against the proposed card system. 1 worked in America at piece work and I know a little of the speeding-up methods employed &quot; in that country/&apos; This attitude was supported by Mr. Tudor&apos;s principal lieutenant, Mr. Higgs (ex-Treasurer of the Commonwealth).On the other hand, the Prime Minister endeavoured to show in the debate that the whole difficulty arose from a disloyal attitude towards the war. He said : &quot;There is no conspiracy to crush unionism, but &quot;there is a conspiracj- to injure i&apos; Great Britain, to disintegrate the Empire, and to hamper the Commonwealth in &quot;&apos;&apos; its war policy, to make constitutional government impossible.&quot; In referring to Mr. Tudor&apos;s accusation about the card system and the conditions of labour in America, Mr. Hughes said : &quot;He has referred to the consequences of speeding-up, &quot; which, he says, occur there, deducing that all these things arose from the card &quot; system or something similar to it, and that if this system were introduced in &quot; Australia, conditions analogous to those he has alleged would obtain in Australia. &quot; I do not believe it for a moment. Such talk is transparent nonsense. When &quot; the Unionists of this country waited on me in a deputation the other day, 1 told &quot; them that I regarded such an assertion as a palpable attempt to bluff the &quot;community.&quot; The Prime Minister added that &quot;the trouble in this country &quot; is that there has been for some time an insidious propaganda in our midst &quot; urging the /workers not to speed up, but to slow down,&quot; and he asserted further &quot; the real cause of this upheaval is political rather than industrial.&quot;The attitude of the parties towards the industrial side of war policy is sufficiently indicated by the above extracts ; and it is only necessary to say that the measures taken by the Federal and State Governments to meet the recent grave industrial situation by the establishment of National Service Bureaux for volunteers, and other methods, proved effective, and the men on returning to work freely admitted defeat.ATTITUDE TOWARDS EMPIRE ORGANISATION.Autonomous Eights: Australia as a Nation. -The position adopted by the Official Labour Party with regard to closer union between the various nations of the British Empire is largely influenced by the fear of any interference with autonomous rights. This was clearly shown in the reference made in the official pronouncement of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) when discussing the attendance of Mr. Hughes at the Meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet last year. He then said : &quot; The Labour &quot; Party is not and never has been opposed to the representation of Australia at &quot; the Imperial Conference, but considers that decisions affecting the Commonwealth &quot; should be submitted to the Federal Parliament for ratification, and the delegates &quot; going should be instructed to oppose any curtailment of the powers of self-govern-&quot; juent that are now enjoyed by the people of Australia.&quot;Though it can scarcely be said that The Australian Worker represents all members of the Official Labour Party, yet it is an organ, which is widely read by Labour throughout the whole of the Australian Commonwealth. The strong national attitude, and the fear of domination by a supreme authority far away from Australian shores, is indicated by a passage which occurred in an article arjpearing in The Australian Worker of April 26th last year, just before the elections. This referred to the idea of closer union by means of Imperial Federation, and attacked the Coalition of Air. Hughes and Mr. Cook in these words : &quot; Return the Fusion to &quot; power on Ma)&apos; 5th and you seal the doom of Australia as a nation standing upon its &quot; own feet and shaping its own future.&quot;    Asking the question,  &quot; What would
Imperial Federation do? &quot; The Australian Worker answered, &quot; Destroy your economic &quot; and political independence, deepen and accentuate class distinctions, and by &quot; making.your country a mere echo of old-world institutions, render impossible the &quot; development of a national genius, fired by Australian feeling and directed by &quot; Australian needs.&quot;An Imperial Executive and Parliament. As to the actual Imperial War Cabinet itself, another article in The Australian, Worker, of April ltth, 1917, states : &quot;We &quot; in Australia have nothing to say as to the War Executh-e for the United Kingdom. &quot; It may be that the conduct of the war demanded some such constitutional &quot; revolution ; that is for the people and Parliament of the United Kingdom to &quot; decide for themselves. But we do say most emphatically that there is no &quot; reason whatever why any Imperial Executive, or other body in London, merely &quot;&apos; because it is attended by a representative from Australia, should take it &quot; upon itself to interfere in any way with our self-governing rights.&quot; Fore-seeing that the Executive above referred to Avould have to be amenable to some sort of control, The Australian Worker pronounces, &quot; The only way open will be to create &quot; a Parliament to which such Executive must be responsible ; thus will come the&quot; Imperial Parliament and. Imperial Federation.....   Thus our own power to&quot;control the great questions of Defence, White Australia, Tariffs, Commerce and &quot; Industry would have passed from here to a Parliament on the other side of the &quot; world.&quot;&quot;B. d&apos;E.
