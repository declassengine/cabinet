PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Imperial War Cabinet and Conference. The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden), the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Arthur Meighen), the Minister for Immigration and Colonisation (Mr. J. A. Calder), and the President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Rowell), arrived in London on June 8th. The above Ministers, and also the Dominion Minister of Overseas Military Forces (Sir Edward Kemp), who was already in London, attended the first meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet on June 11th and of the Imperial War Conference on June 12th.Recruiting under Military Service Act. Since the Military Service Act came into operation, the total number of men enrolled in the Dominion was 73,900 inclusive of those men enlisted in the United States.During the last month (May) 37,886 recruits have been enlisted in the Overseas Forces. This figure includes the men recruited between the ages of 20 and 22, whose exemptions were recently cancelled.   The total enlisted during April was 12,614.With regard to the amendment to the Military Service Act extending the liability for service to men of 19, official returns show that 43,136 men of this age registered under the Act during the month of May.Farmers&apos; opposition to Withdrawal of Exemptions. With reference to the recent deputation to the Prime Minister from farmers&apos; representatives, regarding the withdrawal of exemptions of young men between the ages of 20 and 22, about 2,000 representatives of agriculture assembled last week at Toronto, under the leadership of the President of the United Farmers of Ontario, to consider the situation. Strong criticism of the Government in taking the young men from the farms was one of the features of the proceedings, and amongst the resolutions adopted was one calling upon the Government to amend the Military Service Act, asking that all owners or practical managers of farms be exempted and that skilled agricultural labourers should be exempted to the extent of allowing one skilled man for each 100 acres in general farming districts.French Candian Recruiting. The Minister of Militia (Major-General Mewburn) has recently returned from Quebec, and has described the situation- as highly satisfactory.   He states : &quot; The spirit is continuing, and is there to stay. High class men are coming forward in large numbers, and they are making excellent soldiers. The Laval Unit is one of the best I have ever seen.   It is up to strength and may be extended.&quot;French Canadian Brigade. The Minister of Militia announced last week that Sir Robert Borden was taking to England a scheme for the preparation and formation of a French Canadian Brigade, to enable French Canadian soldiers to be grouped into a Brigade, not only in England, but adso at the Front. He pointed out, however, that the formation of a French Canadian Brigade in the Dominion out of recruits now joining, who could go to the firing line as a separate unit, was impracticable, but he promised that the men would be kept on a territorial basis, and that they would be sent to Quebec battalions in England and France.Canadians in R.A..F. As a result of communications between the Dominion Minister of Overseas Militaiy Forces and the Air Ministry, the latter have uucler-taken to keep records of the number of Canadians in the R.A.F., whose names will be grouped in a special Canadian section. AU Canadians in the R.A.F. will have a special distinguishing mark or badge on their uniform. The Air Ministry have agreed to give the Dominion Ministry full information regarding exploits of Canadian airmen.
Quebec&apos;s Message to the King. The Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Quebec conveyed to His Majesty the King on his birthday on behalf of the Govern-ment and the entire population of the Province of Quebec, the expression of sincere and hearty wishes. The message continued : &quot; Proud of the heroism of your Majesty&apos;s forces, as well from the Province of Quebec as elsewhere, and of that of our gallant Allies, in the face of almost overwhelming odds, we jyvay Divine Providence to hasten that victory of the Allies&apos; Forces which shall bring a lasting peace, for the attainment of which we pledge every possible assistance within our power.&quot;Militia Officers for Oversea, Service. An Order-in-Council has been issued hy the Militia Department stating that any officer on the active or reserve Militia who comes within Class 1 of the Military Service Act and has not been employed in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, or whose employment therein has not been satisfactory, may be required to serve in the Canadian Expeditionary Force in the ranks.Export of Gold. The Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White) has issued a statement, which appears in the Press, that an embargo has been placed on the export of gold bullion from Canada except under licence.The Minister is reported to have stated : &quot; The result of the direct importation of goods which are not actually needed is that the exchange with the United States is against us and our gold has been flowing out to pay the adverse balance. The prohibition of gold exports has been determined upon, coupled with the prohibition of a long list of imports which people can readily do without,&quot;Net Debt of the Dominion. The monthly statement issued by the Finance Department shows that the net debt of Canada on May 31st amounted to S 1,144,225,(-527.&quot;   On the same date in 1917 the net debt stood at $828,793,709.NEWFOUNDLAND.Imperial War Cabinet and Conference. The Prime Minister (Dr. W. F. Lloyd) arrived in London on June 8th accompanied by the Minister of Militia, Mr. J. R, Bennett, Dr. Lloyd attended the first meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet on June 11th and of the Imperial War Conference on June 12th,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Imperial War Conference. At the first meeting of the Imperial War Conference on June 12th, the Commonwealth Solicitor-General (Sir Robert Garran) and Lieut-Commander J. G. Latham of the Royal Australian Navy Board were present.Policy Regarding Pacific Islands. The acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), in reply to a question in the House of Representatives, said the Government thoroughly endorsed Mr. Hughes&apos;s statement of policy respecting the Pacific Islands. Mr. Watt added that Australia was not seeking any territorial reward or extension, but strongly desired that the former German possessions in the South Seas should not revert to Germany, but should be controlled by Great Britain or a friendly power.High. Commissioner ship for the United Stales.- -The Sydney correspondent of the Times (London) has telegraphed that Mr. lfughes&apos;s declaration that Australia should have a High Commissioner in New York has been received with approval in Australia. - -Trades Unions and the War. With reference to the Resolution of the Sydney Labour Council demanding peace by negotiation, several of the Trade Union leaders of New South Wales state that this anti-War Resolution will, mean the break up of the old Council. They declare that the only way to save the industrial movement from complete disaster is for the Unions to join a new Federation (vide Report No. 71).The New South Wales branch of the Federal Electrical Trades Union has passed a resolution, by a substantial majority, that as the Trades and Labour Council is no longer a true reflex of the opinions of the trades union move-ment, and as the extreme elements which have obtained control of it are pursuing a5873-2a A 2
policy inimical to the best interests, of labour, no good purpose can be served by remaining affiliated with the Council.Returned Soldiers. An agreement between the Repatriation Department and the Victorian Education Department for the training of soldiers at Technical Schools was signed on June 3rd.The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) has announced the Cabinet Scheme to prevent invalided soldiers from being supplied with intoxicants. Invalids are to wear blue arm bands, and are forbidden to indulge in liquor, and any person supplying thorn is guilty of an offence. At a Public Meeting held in Melbourne Town Hall, the speakers strongly criticised the restrictions aimed only at soldiers, and a motion was carried unanimously favouring the principle of war-time liquor prohibition throughout the whole of the Commonwealth.Shipping Arrangements. The Commonwealth Government have informed the British Government that the Shipping Board, after careful consideration of the present system of endeavouring to force vessels arriving from overseas to load a full cargo of wheat, have concluded that this is discouraging ships from coming to Australia. The Board believe that more wheat could be despatched as parcels in ships taking composite cargoes than if full cargoes of wheat are made imperative. As the Commonwealth Government agree with the above view, they will not in future make restrictions on the berth loading of vessels, other than those imposed by Allies, if the vessels submit their proposals as to allocation of space to the Controller of Shipping, The British Government are therefore asked to notify neutral and Allied Governments.- Federal Parliament and Active Service-Ten members of the Commonwealth Parliament are either on active service or have returned. There are 37 sons of Members now serving in the war.Nationalist Victory. A by-election at Upper Hunter has resulted in a victory for the Nationalist, according to Press reports. It is to be noted that the last Referendum gave the anti-oonscriptiomists a considerable majority in this constituency.NEW ZEALAND.Imperial War Cabinet and Conference. The Prime- Minister (Mr. W. F. Massey) and the Minister of Finance (Sir Joseph Ward) arrived in London on June 8th and attended the first meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet on June 11th and of the Imperial War Conference on June 12th.Venereal Diseases. The Acting Prime Minister has telegraphed to the British Government stating that he had hoped that Defence of the Realm Regulations, 40 D., dealing with solicitation, would have gone further by segregating infected women, or would at least have prevented them from visiting the precincts of camps. He asks why women suffering from venereal disease cannot be segregated; as is done in the case of infected soldiers, until they are no longer a menace to the community.SOUTH AFRICA.Imperial War Cabinet and Conference. -The Union Minister of Defence (Lieutenant-General J. C. Smuts) and the Union Minister of Railways and Harbours (Mr. 11. Burton) attended the first meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet-on June 11th and of the Imperial War Conference on June 12th.General Botha, on the Allied Cause. Speaking at Estcourt, Natal, on June 6th, the Prime Minister (General Botha) stated, according to a Renter message, that South Africa would not be worthy of her free Constitution if she did not recognise the call on behalf of the Allied cause. &quot;To-day,&quot; he declared, &quot;the Allies are fighting aoainst odds, but I believe in God, and He will never allow a righteous cause to fail. Even if Paris fell we would not cease, because we do not surrender our faith or freedom.&quot;
INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)   -Imperial War Cabinet and Conference. The Secretary of State for India (Mr. E. S. Montagu) attended the first meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet on June 11th, and of the Imperial War Conference on June 12th. The other two repre-sentatives from India had not then arrived.Internal Conditions. During the past fortnight, little of political importance has occurred, but the tone of the Indian Press is continuing to improve.In the Memorandum on events in India during the past year, which has been circulated by the Secretary of State, it is observed that the most important constitu-tional event of the year was the announcement of policy made in the House of. Commons on August 20th last.In referring to the Conference at Delhi on April 27th, the Memorandum states that the Government of India have expressed the opinion that the object of the Conference, which was to enlighten India generally on the situation and to enlist the co-operation of prominent men of all classes in the measures necessary to increase her war efforts, was achieved.Contributions to War Effort. The above quoted Memorandum calls attention, to the fact that since June 1st, 1917, the Native States have continued to make generous contributions, usually in the form of money, for war purposes. Apart from this, the units of Imperial Service Troops on active service are maintained by the Native States at full strength.As to the supply of foodstuffs and material, the Memorandum refers to the paper laid before the Imperial War Conference last year describing the extent to which the Allies were dependent on India for commodities essential to the war, when it was explained that had the resources of India not been available, the difficulties of the war would have been enormously increased, if indeed its prosecution on the present scale would have been at all possible. During the past year the help has been continued, and large quantities of essential commodities have been supplied mainly under State control or by State purchase.With reference to military expenditure, India, it is pointed out, has continued to contribute towards the cost of the Indian Expeditionary Forces a sum equivalent to what the ordinary expenditure on the troops sent out of the country would have been had they remained in India. The net amount so contributed in 1917-18 was about 4p million pounds, but this amount is only a small part of India&apos;s military expenditure, which last year totalled over 28-h million.During the year 1917-18 effect has been given to the Resolution of both Houses of Parliament, passed on March 14th, .1917, giving authority to the Government of India to make a direct contribution of 100 millions towards the cost of the w-ar. The intention being to raise as much as possible of this sum by loan in India, a War Loan was decided upon, and the response to this far exceeded expectations. Before the war a loan of 4 million pounds would have been considered exceptional, but 36 million was received and transferred to the Imperial Government, and at a later date in the same year (1917-18) about 30 million was raised in the form of Treasury Bills for the purpose of financing war expenditure in India, In estimating the meaning to India of this contribution, the Memorandum points out that it should be borne in mind that India is a poor and backward country, lacking many elementary conditions of civilisation which England and the self-governing Dominions have long possessed. It is not, therefore, a case of denying herself luxuries, but of severely restricting expenditure on education, sanitation and industries.National Congress and Scheme of Reform. In the course of an interesting article in the London Times of June 7th, Sir Valentine Chirol calls attention to the Indian National Congress and its claim to speak for the whole.of India, He says that even if this claim were conceded, notwithstanding that its members are drawn from the small section of the Indian people wdio have received some Western education, it lacks altogether the knowledge and experience of public affairs required for devising new machinery of Government in such a country as India, where the very foundations have still to be laid for the democratic institutions that in the West have been the growth of centuries. It is in this connection that Sir Valentine Chirol criticises the scheme of reform proposed by the Congress, which, in his view, is subject to the vital defect that whilst it makes no provision for the practical training of the people of India in responsible Government, it would make all Government impossible under any system compatible with the maintenance of responsibility to the Parliament and people of the United Kingdom, which cannot be discarded until India is herself equal &quot;to the full burden of responsibility.
APPENDIX Western and General Report No. 72.  Part I;NAVAL DEFENCE OF THE EMPIRE.(Sec also Appendix to Western and General Report No. 52, Part I.)Attention has recently been drawn (May 17th, 191S, G.T. 4571) to the delay that -will result if the scheme of naval defence of the Empire, which the Admiralty was asked last year to frame after the war, is not based upon principles likely to meet with the approval of the Dominion Prime Ministers. To draw up a detailed scheme will doubtless take a considerable time and involve much labour, which will all be thrown away if the principles, on which the details are based, should not be accepted. Interminable delays would then result. Political difficulties might arise which are beyond the scope of the Admiralty, and it is clear that to work out details before principles are determined would be to put the cart before the horse.2. At the Imperial War Conference of 1917 an agreement was come to that the readjustment of the. constitutional relations of the component parts of the Empire should form the subject of a special Imperial Conference to be summoned &quot; as soon as possible after the cessation of hostilities.&quot; It was also agreed that such readjust-ment should recognise the right of the-Dominions and of India to an adequate voice in foreign policy and in foreign relations, and that it should provide for continuous consultation and for concerted action, founded on such consultation.3. The composition of the future Conference to deal with these matters has not yet been determined. It is clear that their settlement must take time, the Conference itself more time, and that any agreement might have to be made operative by Acts in many different legislatures, occupying still more time. Realising this, several of the representatives of the Dominions in 1917 referred to the necessity for making-some temporary&apos; arrangement to bridge over the gap, in order to deal adequately with certain urgent matters. Naval defence clearly comes in this category. Without adequate naval defence the Empire, and all that it stands for, freedom for the; nations grouped under the British Crown to develop on their own lines, would cease to exist.4. Certain steps have already been taken to bridge over the gap that must intervene before any readjustment of constitutional relations, as affecting continuous consultation, and foreign policy.   Both depend upon security at sea.5. The importance of central control of fighting forces is one of the most striking of all the lessons impressed by the present war. The outstanding points brought out by practical experience are that, for success in war, all sea forces must be. handled immediately by a single central authority as soon as a critical situation develops, and that, owing to the rapidity of sea movements, it is essential that the peace distribution of war vessels shall be in accordance with war plans.6. The 1917 resolution dealing with constitutional relations also referred to full recognition of - the Dominions as autonomous nations, and the healthy growth of nationality has undoubtedly been strengthened by the splendid part taken by the forces of * the Dominions and of India in the great world struggle for freedom. A solution is required for the difficult problem of reconciling this national sentiment with the central control and peace distribution necessary for the effective employment of sea forces in time of war.7. Sea-power, upon which free and unfettered national development will depend in the future, as it has in the past, requires the successful solution of this problem, above all others now before the &quot; British Commonwealth of nations/&apos;G. G. A..    June 11th, 1918.2\70fe.-Li connection with the above much evidence is now forthcoming of the German war aim to wrest from &quot; England &quot; (sic) her sea-power.
