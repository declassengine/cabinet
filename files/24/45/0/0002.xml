HBHORAffDIM BY THS SISCI^TARY OP STATE FOR WAR.With reference to War Cabinet 363 (6) I circulate the subjoined note by the Adjutant General,1.     In January 1918 the Minister for national Servioe in a semi-official letter to C.I.G.S. foreshadowed an allotment to the Army ofA.iv.   (under 19)    ......A*ii. (over 19 Other Categories........January9,6oo 6,960 8,880February9,6oo 14,320 11,502   ,The numbers actually provided by the Minister National Service during those months are *-A.iv.    funder 19)*******A*ii.    (over   19) *.....*Other Categories........January11,866 7,04o 16,244February12,562 7,8*p 13, 320Of the above, only the A.ii&apos;s, 14,880 (7,040 * 7,840) can definitely become available for the trenches six months hence (allowing for training and wastage).2.     In consequence of the formation of new Artillery units it has bean necessary to allot these A*ii&apos;s for posting as follows:- 0Infantry Artillery3,5ou 7,500The reminder are accounted for by postings to otherarms.The Army Council in the course of the investigation of the Han-power situation in December, 1917 informed the War Cabinet that the number of A* men over 18,8/12 years (recruits) required to maintain the forces in the Field for the months of January and February would be 38,700 for each months   To this contention the Army Council adhere.In addition to the shortage indicated above, 20,000 men of A. and lower categories are in course of transfer to ship-building firms from the ranks of the Army, which will still further reduce the fighting strength.3.     During   January and February the wastage in all theatres has been exceptionally light.-January 16,125 killed, wounded^ and missing.26,660 evacuated sick from France,42,785February
February     7*41o killed, wounded, and missing.ljjT/68o evacuated sick from France. 2 3, 090The number of men who would return to the Field after &quot;being evacuated to England as wounded or sick was estimated by the Minister of National Service for the year 1918 as 300,000.    The Army Council consistently repudiated this estimate as too high, and adhered to their estimate of 198,000 for the yearThe actual numbers of men who have, after being wounded or sick, become fit to return to a theatre of war from England during the last two months are:-January and February up to March 4th,    31,733, or 2,467 below the average estimated by the Army Council.It must be remembered that during 1917 the total fell short of the Army Council!s estimate by 9.000, and in view of the recent low casualties, it cannot be expected that the average will be reached.4.     In consequence of the reduction of divisions in France from 12 battalions to 9 battalions there is at present a surplus of 40,000 infantry in France, from which source 12^000 men are being draw to meet the increase in the Establishment of the Machine Gun Corps.In Egypt there is a present deficiency of 3,000 infantryThe Transportation Service, A*S*C, Labour, etc., all in France, show a deficiency of about 40,0005-.     The Army Council desire again to direct attention to para. 10 of the Military Members Memorandum on the draft report of the War Cabinet Committee on Man-power dated 7th January, 1918, and to re-affirm that in their opinion if heavy fighting on the Western Front commences during the month of Meproh, 1918, the &apos; -Infantry in France will, at the end of April, be 43,000 under strength, which will increase to 88,000 during the&apos;month of May. To meet that deficit there would be no available trained infantry, short of drafting men oversea before they attain the age of 19 years.DERBY.13th March, 1918
