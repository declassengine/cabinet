J-fV[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.!34:SECRET.Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1918.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 42.Week ended 9th March, 1918.I.;.&apos;,&apos;.. NAVAL OPERATIONS.Minelaying operations in tlie North Sea and in the Heligoland Bight have been North Sea. continued.On March 3rd eight R.N.A.S. machines from Dunkirk carried out successful raids on Flanders seaplane sheds at Ostend.   25 bombs (weight, 434 lbs.), were dropped from altitudes of area. 150 to 300 feet and eight direct hits on seaplane sheds, and three on an anti-aircraft battery, were observed.On March 8th, Dunkirk machines carried out reconnaissances over De Haan and Zeebragge seaplane base, and during an engagement with eight enemy aircraft one enemy machine was driven down out of control. SeA^eral fleet patrols were also carried out during the day, in the course of which one enemy machine was destroyed.On March 9th daylight bombing raids were carried out on military billets and railway sidings at St. Pierre Capelle. About 1,200 lbs. of bombs were dropped, and direct hits on three sheds caused a fire. Our machines were attacked by enemy aircraft, with the result that one enemy machine was shot down in flames.On March 2nd, Submarine &quot; H. 5 &quot; was accidentally rammed and sunk by a merchant Casualties, vessel off Holyhead.   Four Officers and 19 men were lost.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.During the week about 22 large enemy submarines have been located, five being of Submarines the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot; type. Of the latter, one was homeward bound, one working operating, west of Gibraltar, one off the African Coast south of the Canaries, and the other two probably south of the Azores, but no definite reports of their movements have been received. The southern portion of the Irish Sea and the western portion of the English Channel were the areas of greatest activity and it is probable that not less than nine boats were operating in these waters.(C 1025)   Wt.      55   3/18   H k S

Submarines possibly sunk are not included.The action reported in the Appreciation for the w7eek ended the 23rd ultimo, in which an Italian destroyer dropped depth charges on a submarine in the Adriatic, is nowr considered to have almost certainly resulted in the destruction of the submarine.On March 4th, H.M.S. &quot;P. 61,&quot; when north-east of the Skerries dropped a depth charge on a large area of oil, and an object, apparently the conning-towrer of a submarine, appeared on the surface, after which two more depth charges were dropped.MERCANTILE LOSSES BY ENEMY ACTION.Number The following is a Comparative Statement of the Number and Tonnage of all Merchantand ton-     Vessels sunk in recent weeks by enemy action :  nage of all ....

The table in Appendix I shows in detail the numbers and tonnage of sailings and Loss.68 of of losses by enemy action, and the percentage of losses to sailings of British merchant Bntlsh steamships of over 500 tons gross register ; and the table in Appendix II shows by trades fntrato as regards such ships the percentage of tonnage sunk by enemy action to tonnage sailing to and from United Kingdom ports during the last four weeks.The British tonnage employed in Overseas trades in each of.the last two weeks is almost identical, but during the week under review no British ship engaged in those trades has been lost by enemy action. The tonnage lost in the Mediterranean, however, is this week considerably greater than usual. As regards British tonnage employed in Coastal and Cross-channel traffic, the percentage of losses to sailings is this week 1-15 as against 1 - 29 last week, Avhile the total percentage of losses to sailings, as regards all United Kingdom traffic, is -71 as against 1-47 the previous week.The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign as well as British, sunk, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by enemy craft and by mine, classified according to areas.It will be seen that the total number of attacks by enemy submarine in the last two weeks are practically the same, there being some increase to record in the North Sea, English Channel and Mediterranean Areas, but considerably less activity in the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel.The following statement shows the number and tonnage of British and Foreign Compara-Merchant Vessels Sunk by Enemy Action in each month since the commencement tivestate-of Unrestricted Submarine Warfare :  meut ofmonthly__   _ losses.

Considering British ships alone, however, the tonnage, lost in September last was also lower than in February, 1918. It will be noticed that while the total tonnage lost last month was only about 15,000 tons greater than in January, tlie British losses for the month are more than 50,000 tons in excess of the January figure, the losses of other Allies being correspondingly lower.There is also exhibited a tendency for the percentage which neutral losses bear to the whole to decrease, which is doubtless accounted for by the arrangements which have been made for u: lazing Neutral tonnage on the safer routes.(C 1025) A -

Harwich and Dover areas and in the approaches to the Firth of Forth and the River Mersey.The sustained minelaying in the Harwich area is most marked and causes considerable difficulty, especially in bad weather when it is not possible to sweep the War Channel. Owing to the adverse effect on the food supplies of the country, especially of London, which is caused by holding up a large amount of tonnage engaged in the Dutch trade, it is sometimes necessary to accept the risk of mines in this area, and as a consequence three - -   merchant ships (two British and one Norwegian) have this week been lost.The enemy have also this week been very active in the entrance to the Mersey. Small groups of mines were first laid off Barrow and Fleetwood, which showed on the surface at low water, no doubt in the hope that Liverpool Sweepers would be diverted to those areas leaving the Mersey uncovered, but special arrangements were made for sweeping in the vicinity of the Bar Light Vessel where 12 mines were accounted for without accident. ,. A. &quot;fast minesweeping unit has now been provided for the purpose of sweeping ahead of important vessels and convoys entering the Mersey.

FOEEIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.The Battleships at Helsingfors have been ordered to Kronstadt, but their crews are unwilling to sail in the ships.The British Naval Attache is arranging for the destruction of ships as far as possible. He states that the plans of the fort and dockyard at Sveaborg (Helsingfors) are to be bought.It is reported from Archangel that the Governor has taken the necessary steps to guard against any secret attempt to destroy the stores.Sweden.The Swedish Government is proposing to withdraw their troops from the Aaland Islands,- and having done so to insist upon the destruction of the existing forts by the Germans.Germany.Information has been obtained from Prisoners of War recently captured in the German s.s. &quot; Dusseldorf &quot; that crews have been sent from Hamburg by rail to Constantinople to man German cargo vessels at that port which are to transport wheat from Odessa. 140 men having left Hamburg on one day for that purpose.These prisoners state that crews have also recently been recruited in North Sea and Baltic ports for a large number of harbour tugs which proceed from Emden to the Black Sea by way of the Ems, the Ems-Rhine Canal, and the Rivers Rhine and Main, and thence down the Danube, in order to tow into Germany barges of wheat obtained from Odessa. It is stated that 20 to 30 such tugs left Germany for that destination &quot;in December and January last.Naval Staff,Uth March, 1918.[ Appendices.
