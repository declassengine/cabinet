HCKOIASS 01? KBITT AITD MORTGAGE INTEREST (AMEH1II5HT) BILL,Memorandum &quot;by the Htr Hon. G.H.Barnes, M,PtTha question of the eviction of tenants of small houses is causing very great trouble.

Another case is at Port Glasgow,, where an employer &quot;bought up a lot of houses and evicted the tenants, to put in his own workmen - tha houses, by the bye, having been erected under Governmont suporvision for munition workers in another yard*   Another case is at the other end of tha kingdom, Brighton, whore rich people are buying houses over tha he^ds of poor tenants, and reserving these houses for exc-apa from London during air raids.   This, I am told., is talcing placa at othar South Coast watering places, and tha matter is axeiting a great deal of indignation ,on the part of poor tenants.     A Bill is now in print, &quot;brought in by the Lord Chancellor, and. I would axpress the hope that the v/ar Cabinet would tales steps to have that Bill put throu/jh, as early as possible.    It is a one clause Bill, and simply altars tho defin&amp;tios of the expression &quot;landlord5^ with a view to preventing this practice of tha last year or twot(SGD) GJT.B,2, \7hltshall Gardens,s wMarch 14th, 1918,it
