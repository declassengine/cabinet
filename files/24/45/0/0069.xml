S E C R E TiCOPY 110.   Fff0.. 1/149/427.lf-3-18.1.     The wFir Cabinet has asked me to consider the poss-ibility of obtaining a favourable military decision to the war either in 1919 or at a later date.ations other than military, and before I can attempt a reply I require information from the Admiralty, the Ministry of Shipping, and the Foreign Office, as to the probable Naval, Shipping, and Diplomatic situation next year.     I have asked these various Departments to let me have their fore-casts, but as I anticipate that it may be some time before I obtain them, I desire in the interim to put before the War Cabinet my views on the possible development of median-ical means as an aid to victory, because if we are to develop those means to the fullest extent of our power in 1919 it is necessary that a decision should be arrived at and a programme agreed upon as early as possible.,2.   The particular mechanical means which I have in view are machine-guns, air-craft, and tanks.At present we are less well-equipped with machine-guns than either the French or the German Annies, though measures are in hand which will shortly increase consider-ably the number of these weapons which m shall have in the field.     I attach the greatest importance to this develop-ment because of the present state of our resources In man-power.     Apart altogether from their great value as an offensive -weapon, as a defensive weapon machine-guns enable us to hold our front with fewer men, and thus materiallyI reduce wastage.     I have no proposals to put forward at present in this respect which require War CabinetapprovalThe answer to this question involves many consider
approval, but as the proposals which I am about to submit with regard to tanks will absorb a large number of machine guns, and will probably necessitate some diversion of manufacturing resources,  I wish to make it clear that, in my opinion, nothing should be allowed to interfere with the continued development of our infantry machine-gun pro-gramme.     This programme will absorb as many men as we can make available from the fighting troops, and there will therefore be no men to be had from that source for manning tanks.3,   The question of aeroplane production is a matter for the Air Ministry, and I only mention it here in order to point out that the enlarged programme of production for ourselves, taken in conjunction with the fact that we may expeot America in 1919 will be in a position to make herself seriously felt in the air, holds out a promise that in 1919 we should have such air superiority as should be a very important factor in enabling us to obtain a favourable military decision.4.   We can only obtain a favourable military decision by a decisive defeat of the German Armies, and this can only be obtained on the Western Front.     It is agreed that we cannot hope for such a decision this year, and. therefore, we have to consider now what preparations we can make to obtain such a decision in 1919.     We cannot decisively defeat the German Armies without breaking through their defensive system on a broad front, therefore our chances of obtaining this decision will turn mainly upon the question of whether a &quot;break-through&quot; is militarily possible.5.   We have during the last two years attempted to reach a decision by infantry attacks, prepared and supported by ever-increasing numbers of guns and expend-iture of ammunition. Making all allowance for thehindrance
hindrance to operations caused by weather conditions, the following points stand out as a result of our experience in this form of attack(a) In order to make it possible for infantry to penetratethe elaborate defences in front of them, very exten-sive preparations cn the front of attack have to be made, taking much time, material and labour, and as a result all hope of strategical surprise has to ^ given up.(b) A large number of guns and gunners are employed, anda vast expenditure tf ammunition is necessary, much labour is employed in making and transporting these.(c) As a result^a) and (b) considerable enemy forcesand heavy guns are brought to oppose our frontal attack.(d) As a result of our bombardment nearly all physicalobstacles are reinsved and complete destruction is entailed sf villages which might later be useful to us, whilst reads and railways in the bombarded area largely cease to exist, and the ground surface is so destroyed that, especially in wet weather, movement of the attacking infantry is much hampered. The forward movement of our guns and the restoration of communicative is greatly delayed and difficulties of supply to advancing troops become very great - a large proportion of the infantry being absorbed in carrying up food, water and ammunition to those act-ually fighting.     The available fighting strength of the infantry is therefore from 25 to 50 per cent less than it should bet(e) We are forced in consequence to shcrt, strictly limitedadvances^- which give the enemy time to withdraw a portion of his artillery, bring up reinforcements and reorganise his defences, with the result that our attack is brought to a standstill.(f) This method of attaok can hardly lead to decisiveresults unless we have so great a preponderance of strength that we can wear out all the enemy!s reserves and still have such superior numbers that we can con-tinue tc press on0     At the best it has so far en-tailed a local advance followed by an ordered with-drawal of the enemy, during which he has ample time to devastate the country in front of us; placing us at the disadvantage of having to reconstruct commun-ications and arrange accommodation for our oroops, all of which absorbs much time and labour, whilst he retires on to a country where everything is already organised,(g) Apart from purely military considerations we shouldtake Into account that the enemy occupies the most important industrial districts of Northern Prance and Belgium, that he has no scruples, and that if he retreats slowly through these countries, our success will be gained at an immense economic sacrifice on the part of our Allies which will be felt for many years after the war has ceased.
\tWhen we consider that a reduction In the fighting strength of the French Army is certain, that we have already reduced our Divisions from 12 to 9 Battalions, that if we suffer this year casualties comparable to thoie of 1917 we alsc- shall have to reduce the number of our Infantry divisions * and that the growth of the American Army in France is slow, while its maximum strength is limited to what oan be main-tained with the shipping likely to be available, I can see no prospect of the Entente having sufficient force to gain a favourable military decision by such methods of attack as have been described above.6. At the end of the campaigning season of 1917 we trisd the experiment at Cambrai of using tanks in large numbers to take the plact of artillery bombardment.Taking the battle of Messines as the most successful example of the methods of Intensive artillery bombardment followed by infantry assault, it is interesting to compare its results with those of the tank attack at Cambrai.   At Messines we attacked with 12 divisions on a front of 16,500 yards.     The casualties in the first 48 hours were 1$,000 and the maximum depth of advance was 4,500 yards. At Cam-brai we attaek&amp;d on a front *f 13,500 yards with 7 divis-ions.     The Casualties in the first 48 hours were 9,500 and the maximum depth of advance was 9,000 yards.   At Messines the country was utterly destroyed, practically for the whole depth of our advance,   At Cambrai we secured several lines of elaborate enemy defences, and a number of villages, comparatively speaking, intact.     The outstanding features in this comparison are      The saving in thu infantry required for the assault, the saving in infantry casualties, the marked increase if ground gained, the fact that the roads, defences, and villages captured were in condition which enabled us to turn them rapidly to our own use, and thesaving
saving of munitions and. of wear and tear to /runs bv substituting a tank attack for intensive bombardment. This comparison is more favourable ts the tank than appears from the actual figures, for the battle of hessines was the result of long experience of the bombardment and assault method of attack, and the conditions of ground and of weather were very favourable.     The results achieved may therefore fairly be taken as representing the high water mark of this form of attack,     The Cambrai tank attack was an experiment and we may reasonably hope that both the tank Itself and the methods of using it will in the future be improved.   Further, the comparison of casualties is favourable to Messines as against Cambrai for no account is taken in the figures given above of the considerable losses suffered during the period of bombardment and counter-bombardment Which precedes the infantry assault in the former type of battle, losses which do not occur in the latter type.   Apart from the specific comparison which I have made above, other detailed calculations, with which I need not trouble the Far Cabinet, have been made independ-ently, which confirm the results cf the comparison and show that the saving in infantry required for a tank attack, as compared with the infantry required to follow up an artillery bombardment, may be taken at 30 per cento, and the saving In casualties should be considerably higher. This study is so favourable to the tank attack that it appears to me to warrant a trial on a much larger scale,7.     It is estimated that, in order to break through the enemy1s lines completely and successfully, we must attack on a front of not less than 50,000 yards, and that for such an attack we shall require approximately 8,000 tanks cf various types.
This front cf attack can ho materially extended by combining the old methods with the new and by using artillery bombardment; gas attack and trench mortar bem-bardment in combination with tne tanks,     The wider the front on which the attack can be made the greater will be the chances of success, but if we are to realise our aim of inflicting a decisive defeat upon the enemy, it is necessary to penetrate his defences in depth and to do so quickly*     A tank attack on a wide front seems to offer the best chance of obtaining this result.I understand that conditions of manufacture are likely to Ximitt our output of tanks for the 1919 programme to about 4 .500*     To this may be added some 500 tanks cf the 1913 programme which should be available for work in -1919, and also some 1,500 tanks of the heavy type which America proposes x,o pu/o m o-ie i leicio     iiiis stiiii leaves us some 1,500 tanks short of what, in my opinion, we should aim at for 1010; and I recommend that America should be urged at once to double her present programme of heavy tanks.     The French are confining their tank produc tion.-to a light type, which while it is a weapon of con-siderable value, is unsuited to such an assault of modern trenches as I have in mind.I suggest that if the War Cabinet agree in principle to the ideas which I have put forward in this paper, it should be sent to the Military Representatives at Versailles and that they should be asked to co-ordinate a programme for a great tank attack in 1919.8.As far as we are concerned, man-power is the nock of the bottle.     To place 4,500 tanks in the field for 1919 we shall require an addition of 46,300 men spread over a period from April, 1918 to March, 1919.        I attach (Appendix A) a statement showing roughly when these men would be required,
I cannot hold out any hope that they can be obtained from man-power which has already been allocated to the Army.   We must hold our front until such tine as we are ready to attack.   Already we are in the position that we cannot see our way to manning the guns which the Ministry of Munitions will turn out in 1918. while our power of keeping up our Infantry Divisions, even with the American assistance which has been promised, depends entirely upon whether vre- avoid heavy casualties this year.   As I have already said above, the expansion of our machine-gun programme will alone exhaust the men we can obtain either by &quot;combing out&apos;5 or by converting the existing military services.   It is, therefore, necessary to ask the War Cabinet for 46,300 additional men for the 1919 tank programme *9.     At present there appear to be 3 Anti-Tank weapons(a) Low flying aeroplanes.(b) Guns.(c) Mine s-I think we can successfully counter the aeroplane and the gun, but I have not yet found the answer to the mine, which has not yet been tried in battle, but is a measure of defence which we must expect.   I mention this in order to show the War Cabinet that in locking up so large a number of men in tanks, and allocating to their construction the very large amount of material and labour required, we are staking heavily on the success of the tank as an offensive weapon. Personally, I think we are justified in doing so, because as I have stated a hove, I can see no way of getting a really favourable military decision except by breaking/through
General Staff.War Office, S.W.I.34th March,  1918.through the enemy1 s linec on a large front.     I can see no way of doing this except by the employment of tanks on a large scale, and such experience as we have had up to the present seems to me to warrant the belief that tanks will go a long way tovrards enabling us to obtain a military decision.     With the long start which we have gained in tank construction it is, I think, reasonable to suppose that we shall always be able to keep ahead of the enemy in this particular device.      Whether he, in his turn, will be able to devise an effective counter to a tank attack on a large scale is necessarily a matter of speculation.The question for War Cabinet decision is whether 46,300 additional &quot;A&quot; men spread over a period of eleven months as shewn in Appendix &quot;A&quot; can be provided for the expansion of the Tank Corps.     An early decision is required in order that training may start in April next.(Sgd.)   Henry Wilson, C * 11 G . St
