16tnthis sqcumsnt is ths propbrty of his britahkic??AB CABIHST.THE SASTERK COI&amp;IITTZB. Memorandum by Lord Curson. (Prepared In accordance with &quot;&apos;ar Cabinet 363,Minute 20).*.***, **********The Tar Cabinet on March 11th accepted the suggestion of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (G.T,3834) that the work of the three Committees now dealing with the questions of the Middle East and contiguous regions, should be co-ordinated , and that a single Committee to be called THS HASTEN COMMITTEE, should be formed under the Chairmanship of a War Cabinet Minister, to discuss and take action upo&amp; all these matters, subject to the final authority of the lex Cabinet.The Prime Minister asked me to draft the outline of such a scheme.As to the composition of the Committee, it appears to me that the full Members, following the lines of other V/ar Cabinet Committees, should be the following,*The Chairman,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, or his Deputy,The Secretary of State for India,The Chief of the Imperial General Staff,A War Cabinet Secretary.Bach of the Members, other than the Chairman and Secretary, would be at liberty to bring with his, or to send is his absence, a departmental representative,    Without these the Committee would not possess the requisite information.   Other Ministers or Departments (s.g* Admiralty,Shipping) sight require, from time to time, to be represented.Inasmuch m the greater part of the vrofk of the Committee is performed in the Foreign Office, the ;?sr Cabinet Secretary will not be able to work effectively unless he is brought into intimate relations with that Office, and. as the different branches of the Committee&apos;s wor&amp; are dealt with in different departments&quot; of the Foreign Office, it seems desirable that the Secretary should be in close touch with the Foreign Office Officials who have hitherto been performing the work, i.e.who $lould act with him as liaison officials, ana should attend the Meetings when their subject is under discussion.i have not suggested any Foreign Office Official connected with the present Russia Committee (which is to be absorbed in the new    ^ Eastern Committee) because I understand that there is not likely to&quot;&quot; be any present need for suchc    I am informed that the Russia Committee has hitherto dealt, for the most part, with technical matters, connected with Murmansk, Archangel, and Vladivostok, andFor Persia, Mr, Oliphant,For Middle Bast, Sir IU Syfcee,
only with one big question of policy riar;  the Trans Caucasus problem.   The latter h. s unfortunately now dropped into the bac^.round; out in so it as it may still be thought to exist, or be likely to revive it will be dealt with&quot;&quot;by the        Oommttea, but wiil hardly require a special foreign Office Official for the purpose.    Should one be wanted later on doubtless the IPorei^u Office will depute.one of thoir staff.&quot;La regards the ran^e of action of the Committee It is difficult to fix precise 6oov;raphieal limits either on the western or on trie Eastern side.   But it would seem broedly Speaking thct whet is called the Eastern f out should constitute the feetor of differentiation,   i.e. enemy movement   or action in the 31- ck Sea, the Caucasus, end Trans Caucasus, Armenia, lersia, the C:sriaa, Transcespia, Tuncestan, Afghanistant in feet the entire western glacis of,the Indian fortress Bhouid fail within its purview. South of this the sphere of the present Kiddle S?st Committee, i.e. cinei, Palestine, Syria, the   Je^as, Arabia, Mesopotamia, the Persian Gulf, would of course be included.The question whether the Committee should attempt to deal with the Russian situation, as it has developed in the direction of Siberia with the Siberian Railway to Viadivostook and with the intervention of Japen is more difficult.   i!&apos;or the present the snewer will probsbly be in the negative, the Siberia cum Japan situation, being in the hands of the YJer Cabinet as a matter of Imperial policy of the first moment.   It v/ill always be possible should the foreign &quot;secretary or the War Cabinet desire to refer to,or to bring in the Eastern Committee.There is another situation in which 2 certain and novel sspeot of the Russian question may fell within the scope of the Committee.    Should the Japanese not enter Siberia and should German influence or German forces establish themselves there, there might arise 0 new Central Asian problem, as the danger thus created began to permeate southwards ond to threaten Turkestan and the rations bordering the Indian Empire on the North.    In that case the whole Central Asian question would have to be treated as one, end the Eastern Committee would be responsible.As regards times of meeting it would seem desirable that the Committee should meet twice a week, say on Monday and Friday afternoon.    If at any time a third meeting were required, it could be arranged for in the course of the week.An agenda should bo prepared in advance i-nd circulated by the Secretary.   The business st the meeting, should be taken^ in a fired order and Minutes should be kept end circulated to the kembars of the Committee snd to the Wer Cabinet.I would propose that the Committee, if approved on the, above lines, should be*,in to act next week.(Int. )   0. of K.March 13th, 1^18.
