His Britannic (Waj3sty&apos;s Governments(This Document is the Property ofIntelligence BureauDepartment of Inform&amp;tion. G.K.W./009SECRETWEEKLY   REPORT   ON   HOLLANDXX.(March 14th 1918)Although the placid nature of the Dutch labourer renders him comparatively unsusceptible to revolutionary propaganda it must not he imagined that the great upheaval in Russia has not had its effect in Holland.   At the general elections In 1915 the Socialist Democratic party scored only 1339 votes out of 780,332 polled. During the war the part;- has made great progress, for at the 1917 elections it polled over seventeen thousand votes out of 231,085 recorded.     This result is the more noteworthy seeing that the last elections were a mere formality made necessary by the alteration of the Constitution and were conducted on the strict inter-party agreement that &quot;who sits will be left sitting&quot;.     The remarkable progress noted is probably d.ue almost entirely to 7/ar conditions:    in the first place to the growing spirit of anti-militarism, and secondly to the not always adequate measures which the Government has taken to secure a fair distribution of the necessaries of life.     ^nti- militarism which was stimulated by the mobilisation of 1914, has been strengthened by the attitude o the military authorities themselves, who, in their desire to give the army an appearance of smartness, tried to enforce regulations, on German lines, which were incompatible with the independent character of the Dutch lower classes.     Deep dissatisfaction has also been created by the striking contrast between the gigantic fortunes accumlated by individuals during the war and the poverty existing among the labouring class owing to the scarcity and
high prices of most of the essential commodities of life.     The ^Social Democratic party, it is needless to say, has made the most of these causes of discontent, which is the more acute in Holland where the patriotic incentive, present in belligerent countries, is missing-.     The agitation, which was in the earlier days of the war especially hitter against the Minister of War, has gradually shifted until, at present, the Minister of Commerce and Agriculture (jjgr Posthuma) has become the scapegoat,on the pretext that his Export policy is responsible for the food-shortage.     This has incidentally created a strong anti-German feeling among the followers of the Social-Democrats in contradistinction to the rather- pro-German sentiments of that larger section of the Socialist party which adheres to Mr Troelstra.It should he under-stood that the majority of workmen in Holland are still unorganized, hut the urganized labourers have increased from 183,050 in 1913 to 303,760 in 1917.     This rapid increaseshows the effect cf the war on Dutch labour,    It has awakened the employers to the danger which threatens from below and has suggeu-ted to the political exploiters of Socialism that they can make a more efficient use of a growing power.     The first effect of this in practical politics was the passing of a mearsure for extending and revising the franchise which has given the vote to all male Netherlands subjects of 25 3Tears of age.The extreme section of the- Socialist party under Mr. Wijnkoop are in touch with the Russian Bolsheviks;   but their leader would seem to have no Intention of compromising his chances at the 1918 elections- by permitting his followers to degenerate into-anarchism. At present the moderate Socialists under Troelstra have an over-whelming majority.     Under normal conditions -the-advano-ed party would have little chance of a future in Holland,    But the food&apos; conditions, as everywhere els a. ^-^ire-^re various f.....and.,r evolutionary
infection is in the air.    The recent attempt of the advanced party to provoke a general strike was a fiasco, &quot;but there is no doubt -that anarchic doctrines are attracting attention in Holland and may, if the war continues far long, lead to further developments.Various scandals regarding food distribution are engaging public attention in Holland, and ane at least has been discussed in the Second Chamber.     The case is very-briefly as follows.     Mr, de Jong a member of the C&amp;kmhot, had for some time been under an accusation of having used his position at the Ministry of Agriculture to favour certain private interests^     He at first managed to clear his charac ter- to -the satisfaction of his fellow members of the Liberal Union, &quot;who&quot;investigated ths charges and declared them to be unfounded. But the matter did not rest there.     Publication of the Report of ohe Liberal Union was demanded and was finally conceded.     It was then discovered that although his Part^ only found him guilty of imprudence the accusations involved more serious conclusions.     Mr. de Jong has announced        that he would not a^ain stand for Parlia--ment and&apos; the incident has led to attacks in the Press on more in-fiusntial persons, such as Mr.  roller, the oro-German &quot;uncrowned King of Holland&quot;, who is vigourously denounced in the &quot;Tele&amp;raaf&quot; for spreading the spirit wf corruption throughout the country.
