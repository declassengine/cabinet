Progress is being made with the cottages on this Colony and it is anticipated that three pairs will be up by Lady Day.Efelham Estate.     The farming of the Estate is being proceeded with.     Cf the area which will be taken in hand when notices expire iA April as much as possible is being dealt with no**, by arrangement with the outgoing tenants.     Ploughing of pasture land has been commenced and a considerable portion will shortly be cleaned and sown, German prisoners and Army horses have been obtained for ploughing. Sales of timber not required on the Estate are being effected, in particular ash of the first grade required for aeroplane purposes, l4 consequence of the shortage of cottages and the impossibility to obtain estimates for brick cottages, two urgently required for workmen oil one of the farms being left in occupation of the present tenant, are tcj be built of concrete from gravel from the Trent,    The object of this is to obtain the cottages within a few weeks, and at the same tifre explore the possibilities of the gravel in this river running through the Estate as a means of income.Flax Production Branch.The total area of land asked for by the Air Board, namely 10,000 acres, has now been contracted for, and it may be found possible even to exceed this area.     The first consignment of Dutch seed has arrived in this country,     further surveys of premises to be acquired for dealing with the crop have been submitted by the Office of Works, and negotiations for taking over those found to be suitable are proceeding.     These include Crowle (Lines), Glemsford (Suffolk), Miiborne Port, Dorchester and Bridport (Dorset),    Fifty pairs of deseeding rollers of the type now in use at 8elby have been ordered, and in the meantime working models of suggested improvements over the present antiquated methods have been erected and are being tested with a view to economy in labour.Tithe, Copyhold. Commons and Survey Branch.The fresh applications received during the past week include 4 for altered apportionment, 4 for redemption and 5 for merger of tithe rentcharge and 3 for enfranchisement of copyhold land.     The increase in the value of tithe rentcharge continues to give rise to many enquiries by titheowners as to whether it is to their advantage
to encourage redemption.     Owing to the fact that circumstances in different parishes vary considerably, the net income derived from each  100 of tithe rentcharge is not uniform throughout the country, but it may be safely alleged that in all cases redemption involves a marked increase in the income of the incumbent concerned.Ordnance Survey.During the week 170,532 maps were Bent to France and 9,747 to the Admiralty.     20 relief models were sent to Frances 1 draft of Royal Engineers for the Field Survey Companies was sent to FranceoCommeroial Control Branch.The work of the Branch during the week in addition to enquiries and correspondence as to extended commercial oontrol after the war, cases of alleged poisoning of stock by the use of rape oake and an enquiry into the ability of manufacturers to satisfy the actual and expected demands for cheese making apparatus, has consisted principally of correspondence as to railway facilities for eg 8 and agricultural machinery and the cartage of hay, the approval of names for margarine and correspondence on matters arising in connection with the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act.Publications Branch.The number of applications for ordinary issues of the Leaflets dealt with was 2^.79, in response to which 5,600 copies of : Leaflets were despatched.

The Division are in communication with the Admiralty and Board of Education with regard to a scheme for the technical education of fishermen after the Far.

The primary object being the extension of the fishing season for freshwater fish in the interests of food supplies.     The War Office have called attention to the stocks of herring barrels returned from France and now at Deptford, and endeavour is being made for the distribution of the barrels to the Trade.     In the interest of the development of the Fish Canning Industry the Board have applied to the Treasury on behalf of two large fish canning firms for permission to charge to revenue, replacements of capital or new capital expenditure, as the case may be, whether the expenditure be in the nature of fixed capital, or of working capital.     The principles which it is sought to apply to the two cases in question should, in the Board1s view, be regarded as applicable to any siinilar extension of fish canning plants, or the establishment of new works for the purpose.Fishermen^ Registration and Recruiting Section.   Figures have &apos; been received from the Registrar General of Shipping aB to the personnel of the fisheries, and are under consideration with a view to their being utilised in the attempt to obtain for Navy or fishing fishermen now in Military Service.

Probably about  50 will be the maximum in each case, Satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Public Trustee regarding tho Epney Elver Depot, so as to enable possession to be taken at an early date.Fish Food Committee.     In view of the approaching boating season the regulations for amateurs have been reconsidered in consultation with the district Inspectors,     It is reported that considerable irritation, was caused last year owing to professional fishermen being forbidden to use their boats for pleasure purposes, even at times when no fishing could be done.     The Committee have now decided to recommend to the Admiralty that last year&apos;s Regulations be re-issued, but that wide discretion should be given to modify such regulations where thought advisable in any particular place. The Treasury having sanctioned the expenditure of the Committee&apos;8 funds for propagating mussels,    -. an officer has now been appointed for the purpose of making the necessary preliminary investigations. The Treasury have agreed to the Committee utilising their funds in the promotion generally of the propagation and distribution of eels, acting for this purpose through the Freshwater Fish Committee as their agents.    Matters of finance will be submitted to the Secretary of the Fish Food Committee.Motor Loan Committee.     Further installations 1iave been completed during the past week and several others are progressing rapidly.
