% Board of Agriculture and Fisheries,I j T/^jRepovt for the week ended 19th March.1918*Pig Production.The Section is not yet fully formed but a meeting of the Advisory Committeewas held to consider the question of the regulated prices of pigs, weight at which those prioes should operate, control of slaughter of pigs, minimum weight at wbieh slaughter should be allowed, whether slaughter of female pigs should be restricted.     The difficulties of obtaining concentrated feeding stuffs was also considered.The Director had an interview with the Pood Controller and an agreement was come to as to prices and weights.    The terms of an Order as to prices was discussed with the Ministry of Pood. A very large amount of correspondence with the general public is heing dealt with.Land Division.Holheach.    The drilling of the spring corn has been finished, and already about 60 acres of the land has been rolled.    50 acTes of potatoes have already been planted, and a Pord Tractor on the Colony has been doing most excellent work getting ready for flax.Patrington.     Oats, peas and barley are being drilled and lambing is in full progress.Heath Hill.    Application is being made to the Salop Agricultural Executive Committee for the services of 25 soldiers in order that a considerable area of land may be planted with potatoes in the Colony in response to the Prime Minister&apos;s Appeal.Kelham Estate.    The concrete cottages referred to in the previous report have now been put in hand.    The leases of the Trent gravel are being reconsidered in the interest of the Estate Committee.    The Mineral Rights leased by the vendors to a Company in arrear with its rent is being determined.    Difficulties are being experienced in housing the workmen for the farming operations, as no notices were given in the case of the few cottages which were held under separate tenancies.     This difficulty is being overcome so far as possible by methods of persuasion and special arrangement.    The stocking of the Estate is proceeding rapidly and at fair prices.Flax Production Branch.The total area of the land contracted for now amounts to 12,388 acres.     The amount&apos;promised was over 15,000 acres.   Careful selection of the land promised has been made so as to eliminate unsuitable land, and ne further contracts are being entered into. The first consignment of Dutch seed has arrived at the various centres for early sowing.    The possibility that the seed would not be in time to deal with the whole acreage has now been avoided:   a reserve of Canadian Flax seed has been secured to cover any possibility of failure of prompt arrival in the later shipments of Dutch seed.     Representatives of the Board and of the Office of works are visiting Bonnetable near Paris to inspect the Ross system of retting and treating flax.     It is hoped that valuable information wi]l be obtained to assist in the most economic equipment of the improvised factories being established by the Branch.
Tithe, Commons, Copyhold and Survey Branca. ;During the past **eek five applications for the enfranchisement of copyhold, seven for the redemption and three for the altered apportionment of tithe rentcharge have &quot;been received. Progress has also been made with many other transactions under the various Acts administered through this Branch.    Hany miscellaneous -enquiries received from farmers and professional men on points of law and practice relating to tithe rentcharge, copyholds and commons have also been dealt with and answers have been sent to representations made by various bodies and individuals in favour of amending the provisions of the Tithe Acts as regards redemption and the annual variation according to the septennial averages.    Among the Private Bills sent by the Treasury to the Board for consideration is the Sheffield (Corporation) Consolidation Bill.     The Chairman of the Gloucestershire Agricultural Executive Committee has personally made urgent representations to the effect that the proceedings for the inclosure under the Inclosure Acts uf Elmstone Har&amp;wick (Glos.) Comrnnn should be completed as soon as possible, in order that steps may be taken not later than June next to bring the land affected into a proper state of cultivation.    Every      effort is being made to bring to completion at an early date the elaborate and complicated procedure laid down by the Inclosure,Acts under which this inclosure is being effected.Ordnance Survey.During the week ended 20th March 168,215 maps were sent to Prance and 40,296 to the Admiralty.     20 relief models were sent to Prance.Commercial Control Branch.The ^ork of the Branch during the week, in addition to enquiries and correspondence as to the improvement of rural transport and extended commercial control after the war and as to cases of      ! alleged poisoning of stock by the use of rape cake, has consisted principally of correspondence as to railway facilities for agricultural machinery and egss, the cartage   of hay, the approval of names for   * margarine and correspondence on matters arising in connection with the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act.

A Deputation from the Herefordshire Labour iTepresentaiion Committee was received.     The Committee pres-sed for labour representatrlo*vs on Boards of Conservators, and the Freshwater Fish Committee, and fcr further fishing facilities in the River ^a. The Board under the pcrvers conferred upon them by the Pood Controller have issued an Order extending for one month the open season for freshwater fish,     A further Order giving effect to other
1 recommendations of the Freshwater Fish Committee is in draft and will be issued in a few days.    Advice has &quot;been given to applicants in several Fishery Districts who are desirous of obtaining relaxations of fishing restrictions in the interests of increasing the fcod supplies, particularly as regards the taking of salmon kelts. Negotiations are in progress regarding the grant of fishing facilities off the West Coast to certain Icelandic and Norwegian trawlers.Permit Section.     35 permits have been issued to fishing boats and 27 cancelled.Fish Food Committee.     The Herring fishing season in England begins at North Shields in the latter part of April, and the Trade Branch will be fully occupied during the next fortnight in making all arrangements for the supply of the boats, with all necessaries including coal, oil, salt, smoking materials etc    A large number of empty boxes and barrels have been reported at the Army Depots at Deptford, and the Committee have been invited to inspect them with a view to sale and distribution among the trade.     Complaints have been received of the bad train services between Dungeness and London resulting in the fish reaching Billingsgate in a damaged condition.    The Committee are taking the matter up with the S.E. and Chatham Railway with a view to an improvement in the train services, so that if possible the facilities granted last year may be renewed during the coming fishing season.Fishermen&apos;s Registration and Recruiting Section.     With a view properly to inform the Board as to the position in regard to labour and direction of labour of the shore workers of the fish producing and distributing trades, census forms are being distributed, inviting employers to communicate particulars of their present and pre-war staffs, and similar relevant matters.     These enquiries whioh have already been carried out in somewhat less detail at Grimsby assisted in the formation of a judgment as to according the Boards support for requests for exemption or release from Military Service.     They also facilitate the determination of the requirements of a Season at a port, which is a necessary preliminary to the attempt to see that these requirements are met.Motor Loan Committee.     Motor installation at Poole is being delayed just now for want of ship-yard facilities.     The available space and labour is just now completely taken up by Admiralty requirements. At Southwick and at Folkestone the Committee&apos;s mechanics have work for some weeks to come.    At the former port two installations, and one at the latteT, have just been completed.    Among the minor troubles of the time is the difficulty of satisfying the owners of petrol-driven engines.    Even with petrel at its present price they want to have quantities that in the present scarcity are not available.    Engines of this kind seem to be under the special patronage of Food Committees, and the Motor Loan Committee have a difficult course to steer between the demands of the Food Committees that nothing shall impede the supply of fish and the necessity for ; economising the available supply of petrol.The work of the Department in connection with Agricultural education, veterinary contrpJl and livestock improvement continues as usual.
