Such differences as have arisen between Lo2*d 3swten!g Department and others Kith regard to civilians were &quot;based cn^grounds of -oolioy which were, when necessary^ submitted co the War Cabinet and the views of the [Departments which differed from those held by Lord Uewton were endorsed *The power a a-skod for by Lord Howton are, probably of neces-sity, vaguely defined, but had thoy been previously conceded to him he sight have considered hiaseXf justified .1a over-ruling the opinions ox the Admiralty, War Office and Roma Office on the proposals recently made by him for a general exchange of interned civilians with Germany, whioh wore not accepted by the Yvar Cabinet on 6th March (Tear Cabinet 360 (16) h    If Lord Newton still advooates that the private claims of the small number of British civilians interned and detained is enemy countries are such that they should be met at the expense of the ifevai and Military -interests of oursalves and our Allies, he mu$$ espect to meet with opposition.In the proceedings of the Ifar Committee of Itih October, 1916, when the organisation of a specisi Department to deal with questions regarding&apos; prisoners of war sraa first under consideration, it was decided that the predominance of the views ef tho Admiralty and the War Office in all questions of exchange, repatriation and ( internment of prisoners of war, both coabists^t and civilian, j?howl4 be recognised^   k% the Meeting of 26th Oot-obar when this decision was revised and a special Department under Lord Newton was set up, this point was net emphasised   X consider that thojfroaMaiaating importuneo cf $aval and Military opinion in all questions *8ai oh &amp;m in aay way affect the fighting strength of the Allied or Enemy Powers or in any $ueetione of po-lioy whioh concern the Admiralty and the 19ar Office should be defini^ly Tecogaisnd.
- s -In my opinion it is highly inadvisable to grant the powers suggested, for I do not think that it is in accord with the responsibilities of the ?irst Lord of the Admiralty and myself that an over-ruling authority should rest with the Controller of the Prisoners-ox-War Department.(Signed)     DERBY.18th March, 1918.I concur.19th March, 1918.(Signed)   ERIC GSDD2S.
