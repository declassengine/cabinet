WEEKLY REPORT ON NORWAY. IX.

(March 14th, 1918)



Business.

The condition in Norway at the opening of the New Year, the enormous difficulty of shipping, the prevailing scarcity of raw material, the threatening scarcity of food, and the slender success of ? emissions have had a marked effect on the business life of the country. It has been found that in the past two years too many banks have sprung up, and the older banks have increased their subscriptions. The Government has consequently put forward a proposal to stop such developments, unless sanction is first obtained, fearing a general crash should bad times come later on.



Foreign Relations.

There is considerable unrest in the country arising from fear of Bolshevik agitation which has begun in Trondhjem and elsewhere, from the revolution in Finland, from the action of the German Government in regard to the Aaland Islands, and from their treatment of some of the Danish islands off Kiel as if they were the actual owners. Moreover in the "Kolnische Zeit?" a Professor Hiltebrand recently wrote "Norway is so rich in ports, that it can easily spare Narvik, and on the side of Germany no particular consideration need be shown to Norway, who all through the war has placed herself at the disposal of England". Narvik, near the Murman Coast is an ice-free port, is within moderate steaming distance (460 miles) of the Spitzerbergen coalfields, which are undergoing considerable development, and is a port of call for ships carrying ore from the Syd Varanger and Dunderland fields further North it might therefore in the future have from the Commercial and tactical standpoint a very considerable
importance .    In a paper called &quot;Klasse Kampen&quot; (class-war) the editor, Eugene Olaussen, welcomes the new Bolshevik movement among the workmen.     The most advanced socialism has generally been fcun3 in the Nirth among the fishing population.     To a considerable ex-tent this is due to hostile propaganda, because unknown donors have recently sent some  3,000 to Trondhjem for the use cf the &quot;extreme Socialists&quot;.     It is likewise reported that attempts are being made tcj create trouble in the Munitions factory at RaufosiAs is well-knowri, the Nxfrwegians have shewn themselves as a whole during the. recent drying times good friends of this country, and so a British propaganda under such conditions would seem easy.    However, it is stated that a person sent cut to preach war-aims to the Nor-weglans and to make it clear that we are fighting for the rights of small nations, has returned, stating that he could make nc headway, because everywhere he was confronted with stories issued by the German Prooaganda, of our Government&apos;s action under martial law in Ceylon in 1915, and much was made of the refusal to accept conscri1?-ti--n in Australia, it being stated that owing to the shootings in Dublin in the 1916 rising, the Irish in the Commonwealth were strong ly otipOsed to the proposal.     The &quot;Morgenblad&quot; recently stat-ed that articles in the British Press had been a proof of their &quot;complete ignorance of Norwegian affairs&quot;. Shi oping Losses.At the beginning of the war in 1914 Norwegian tonnage amounted to 2,649,000 tons, but at the end of 1917 it had shrunk to about  1,930,000 tons, being a decrease of 450.000 tons in steamships and 220,000 tons in sailing ships, due chiefly to the activity of enemy submarines.     Nevertheless the ship-owners have become very rich because the value of freights has sprung up from 210 million kronov in 1914 td 1063 million kronov in 1916.     Norwegian ship-owners,
through purchase of foreign vessels and contracts for new boats in the United States, have done their best to. maintain their fleet during the war, but new, owing to the impossibility of purchasing new ships they have become powerless on lookers at the rapid des-truction of their Property, with no opportunity of renewing the same in the near future.     If the losses sustained by the Norwegian fleet during the war, say afcut 1,5QjO,000 tons dead weight, are calculated 9$ the recent current prices they amount to the huge sum of  90,060.OOO. in addition to which about 1000 Norwegian seamen have lest their lives.     In consequence of these heavy losses numerous officers and sailers are unemployed.     The losses fer Februareyare reported as being 16,800 gross tonnage, and 39 seamen killed or missing. Foreigngrs.Last week a delegation of 10 members of the Finnish Landtag arrived in Christiania, the members of which travelled in dig-guise through the districts controlled by the Rec5 troops and narrowly escaped being captured and shot.     The object of the delegation is to report on the Finnish situation to the Norgwgian Government. -Some 40 Russian Bolsheviks have been expelled from uerway as undesirable.     Aiaong them is Angelica Balabanaff,who was travelinf as special messenger of M. Vorovsky, the representative in Stock-holm of the Russian Bolsheviks.     Having been refused passage at the Finnish frontier the party returned and went to Stockholm.A telegram from Washington stated that the Norwegian Government has agreed to the proposals of the War Trade Board, which they con-sider harsh, in view of the sacrifices which   Norway has made, be-cause they felt somewhat nervous at the-i^exmanuJrcrrarn^ sal to give wheat to Norway, as it &quot;wished to be NorwayTs best friend&quot;, but in reality because it wished to prevent any imnorts 11
or economic agreement with America,The,, &quot;Silsa&quot;.&quot; . ..... . ,Th^re are few events since the war began which have reused so. &quot;ttomuch ill-feeling against England as the torpedoing of the Asutralianliner &quot;Elsa&quot; by the Germans on Jan, 21st last.     The British ambhcr-ities ate looked uoon as directly responsible for the loss of a newvessel with a cargo valued at about  550,000, because in order toavoid being brought into the danger zone an examination in accordancwith the wishes of the British authorities was made at Freetown,Sierra Leone.     The ship was later told to go to Bristol to dis-charge some 1600 tons of sugar.     There were two days starm,,whichdid certain, damage to the- ship and drove her tinto Fa1mouthy/whenceabcfut I . .&apos;.she was sent to Bristol.   On leaving Bristol when/abfeast ifNewport (Mon. ) she was torpedoed.     The valuable cargvo consistedcf sugar, tea, copra, oil,shellac and jute.     The Norwegian content ion is that having been examined at Freetown the master shoulds khave been free to have chosen his own course, even had it-Been required.&apos; that the sugar be returned by some other means to England.      Three other vessels of the same line ate shcrtl^ex-pected, and the owner, as well as their countrymen, are anxious as to whether they wi11 be treated in the same, manner. Espionage.It will be remembered that a certain &quot;Baron&quot; Rautenfels, a&quot;Xing!s Messenger&quot;, whose real name was W. ven Gerich, and also knownunder the names of Harold Broms,  Johanson and Von Rosen, was dis-trunkscovered carrying bombs in the/addressed to the German Legation inChristiania.     Rr:utenfels was also said by one of his Confederates, to be/a Lieutenant in the Finnish Brigade in Germany.     Some of his as-sociates who were recently arrwsted and tried were convicted and condemned t&amp; imprisonment for terms of from 6 years downwards.
One of them, fesonen-, stated that he joined the Finnish 3rigade in Germany in 1915.     On the acid glasses of some of the 109 bombs discovered, English letters were found, although the experts stated that they were undoubtedly made in Germany.     About 100 bombs had clockwork percussions, which could be timed at from 1 to 14 days, and there were also bombs made to look like pieces of coal of the same pattern ws were used for Atlantic liners sailing from New York,     One of the remarkable things of the German spy system in Norway and Sweden is that it was controlled by a. Dr. Filchener, whs had led a South-pole expedition of his own, and was actually en-gaged to go with Captain Amundset on his North-pale expedition, which should have started in 1915.     Of course under these condi-tions Dr. Filcipher*s presence attracted no attention in Norway. This person was also well-known to members of the Royal Geographic?-:! Society here through his South-pole research, and in the same way his prolonged stay in this country would have attracted no attention Spitsbergen.Since writing the sbove it is reported in the Xondon press that among the supplementary claims against Russian put forward by German is that *f &quot;permission to exploit Spitsbergen&quot;, which has very valuable and easily worked coal-fields.     This group of islands was discovered by Hugh Willougby in 1553.     In recant times it has been a &quot;no mans land&quot;.     Russia has a shadowy claim which was never exercised, and Norway also had a claim, on the ground that the workmen on the island were exclusively Norwegian and required some protection.     A Conference took place on the matter in -Copenhagen in 1908.     There were recently two English mining companies there which came to grief, and their interests were ab* sorbed by an American company, which was developed on a considerab. scale, and is reported to have done well finaneiallyand is putting
cut a considerable amount of coal.     With the port of Narvik on the mainland (mentioned above) in German hands, the iron ore fields cf Syd Varanger and ^underland (an English Company) would be entirely controlled , and also to a considerable extent the whole of the Murman coast.The British authorities have hitherto apparently failed to exploit the possibility of the value of Spitsbergen, although their attention has been frequently called to its value, under certain conditions.
