Dr. Trumbric called at the Foreign Office recently and informed Lord Robert Cecil that he was about to go to Rome to hold a demonstration with his Italian friends in favour of this Treaty, and that he was anxious that you and your French colleague should attend this ceremony.

AGREE IN PARTICULAR UPON THE FOLLOWING(4)    In regard to the relations between the Italian nation and the nation of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (also known by the joint name of the Yugoslav nation), the representatives of the two peoples recognise that the unity and the independence of the Yugoslav nation is a vital interest of Italy, just as the completion of the national unity of Italy is a vital interest of the Yugoslav nation.
----And therefore the represent-atives of the two peoples bind themselves so to employ their whole activity that, during the War and at the moment of peace, these aims of the two nations may be entirely fulfilled.(5)   They affirm that the liberation of Ifhe Adri&amp;tia Sea and its defence against every present or eventual enemy&quot;i* a vital interest of the two peoples.(6)   They engage themselves to settle amicably the various territorial controversies in the interest of the futur good and sincere relations between the two peoples, on the basis of the principles of nationality and of the right of peoples to decide their own destiny, and in such manner as not to damage vital interests of the two nations which will be defined at the moment of peace.?)   Tho right to respect for their language, their Culture, and their moral and economic interests will be recognised and guaranteed to the nuclei of either people that may have to be tnclnfisd within the boundaries of the other.March 7th, 1918,Xrr.
