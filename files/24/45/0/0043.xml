(13th March 1918.)I circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions on the labour position in munitions industries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I.-STRIKES.During the week ending the 13th March, 16,071 working days or TVth of 1 per cent, of the possible working time were lost through strikes on munition work, as compared with 13,934 days or ,JTth of 1 per cent, of the possible working time in the preceding week. At the end of the week, 3,417 workers were on strike, as compared with 917 on the 6th March. Seven out of 13 strikes reported during the week have been settled, including two out of four wrhich were carried forward from the previous week. Important strikes still in progress affect 700 aircraft workers at Leeds and 1,000 engineers at Southport.&quot;:;:&quot;At Leeds the aircraft workers have struck in connexion with a demand for the application to their industry of engineering advances. The Southport strike Avas caused by the dismissal forbad time-keeping of the shop steward leader, J. T. Murphy. His fellows allege victimization.Temper of Munition Workers.While watchfulness is always necessary on the part of the Ministry of Munitions to prevent disputes and to adjust them when they arise, the situation for the moment among munition workers is peaceful. The prevailing temper shows a marked improvement over that of a few weeks ago. The course of events in the East of Europe seems to have had a powerful effect in steadying working-class opinion in this country. Sir Thomas Munro, of the Ministry of Munitions, who recently paid a visit both to the North-East coast and to Glasgow, was strongly impressed with this, and reports an excellent temper on the part of the workers, accompanied by a reasonable and conciliatory attitude on the part of the employers. Representatives of the Ministry during a recent visit to Glasgow had an opportunity of ascertaining the viewrs of representative persons as to the drift of popular opinion on the Clyde. The Lord Provost, Sheriff Eyfe, and Sir Robert Bruce (editor of the Glasgow Herald) all agreed that the situation was quieter than for many months past. Sir Robert Bruce, in particular, was of opinion that not more than 10 per cent, of the workmen in that area were in sympathy with the extremists. Prom other parts of the country come reports confirming the satisfactory state of working-class opinion at present, and, in particular, trade union officials in Manchester are quoted on the stimulus to national feeling given by recent developments in Russia.II. THE DISCHARGE OP WOMEN MUNITION WORKERS.The discharges from munition factories resulting from the cut in programme, after allowing for cases of practically certain and speedy re-absorption, will amount, it is estimated, to 40,000 women and 20,000 men. The further cut in small-arms ammunition may affect 8,000 or 10,000 workers, and that in brass strip and cupro-nickel will involve a few hundreds more.fThe men are all absorbed as rapidly as they are discharged, and in their case no difficulty has been experienced.* Four additional strikes were reported on the 14th March. Aircraft workers at Cowes, to the number of 400, struck on Wednesday in protest against the dismissal of a man who refused to sharpen tools for women workers.f In the six weeks euding the 25th January 1918 the  number of workers employed in the National Shell Factories decreased from 20,118 to 19,827 a diminution of 1-4 per cent.   In the National Filling Factories the number fell from 65,723 to 63.114 a decrease of 4 per cent. ,/   f33)5372   Pk 20   125   3/18   E&amp;s
As regards the women, the . Ministry of National /Service and the, Ministry of Labour are notified as soon as information is available of the discharges that &quot;are contemplated. Lists of firms likely to be affected for several, months ahead are prepared, and measures are taken, through the Ministry of Munitions dilution officers and the Employment Exchanges, to spread the discharges over as long a period as possible, and to attract the available labour into the proper channels. In each Division a local committee has been set up, on which the Admiralty and the Ministries of Munitions, of Labour, and of National Service are represented. In their efforts to mitigate hardships the representatives of the Employment Exchanges, when many women are involved, make a point of getting into communication with the local representatives of w.omen&apos;s organisations. ; &apos;It appears from the information in the possession of the Ministry and from information obtained from the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of National Service that the openings for women on munitions and war work which are likely to present themselves during the present year are as follows: Eilling Factories.- -15,000.Aircraft Factories.-72,000 (? perhaps over-estimated). Royal Flying Corps. 18,000 by August. Land Army.-2,000 now; 10,000 later.W.A.A.C. and W.U.N.S.-Possibly 1,000 per week in a short time. To replace Army recruits. 70,000 to 100,000 men are to be &quot; combed out,&quot; and many of these must be replaced by women.There is a very large demand for women for domestic service, but most of those discharged prefer to stand by for a time in the hope of obtaining remunerative munition work. The discipline of the W.A.A.C. and W.R.N.S. acts as a deterrent, to many who otherwise are well qualified for these services. Many women, however, who were not industrially employed before the war will be prepared to return to their home duties. Out of 1,600 women discharged at Leeds only 650 registered at the Employment Exchange-the procedure necessary to qualify them for receiving unemployment benefit. At Kynochtown, similarly, out of 350 women discharged only 136 registered. This evidence that there is no general distress is borne out&quot; by special reports received by the Ministry of Munitions from chief investigation officers and chief dilution officers.Among the few places where difficulties are anticipated, the most notable is South Wales, where reductions will have to be made simultaneously at Pembrey, Swansea and Newport. In general, however, there is plenty of work for the women, if they are prepared to take what offers.One difficulty about the suggestion that a special allowance of 25s. per week for four weeks should be paid to women munition workers out of employment is that such a procedure would establish a precedent, and lead to claims not only by male munition workers, but by workers on the munitions fringes and ultimately by everybody engaged on any sort of war work.A further difficulty is that a special unemployment grant to munition workers at a time when there is abundance of war work to be done would place a premium on their remaining unemployed and rejecting less well-paid but essential services  e.g., on the land or in hospitals. The dilemma would be created of either establishing munition workers as a specially-favoured class, or of conceding to all the right to be paid while remaining idle at a time of supreme national need.III.-THE NEW POOD SECTION.With regard to the establishment of the Food Section of the Ministry, referred to in these notes for the 12th February, it should be stated that the introduction of the rationing system and the general food shortage have created a position with regard to munition workers which, unless it is carefully handled, may easily have a serious effect on output. It is, of course, the business of the Ministry of Food to see that the supplies of rationed foods are available, but that Ministry are anxious that the Ministry of Munitions should co-operate in seeing that the many local difficulties that arise are smoothed away. Moreover, the Ministry of Food are in constant touch with the Ministry of Munitions on questions of differential rations for munition workers, and as to other labour problems involved by the food situation. It is therefore no longer possible for the Minister to delegate responsibilities in these respects to the Liquor Control Eoard, and arrangements have been made for
the transfer to him for the time being of the functions of the Canteen Committee of that Board.The Pood Section will encourage the increase of central feeding at factories and will advise firms as to cooking facilities and questions of accommodation. A start is to be made with the National Factories, and with the experience derived there, the work will be extended to controlled establishments.The Section will advise firms as to the means of securing supplies not only of rationed, but also of non-rationed foods. In each of the principal munition areas a local officer will act as inspector inquiring into all food problems arising in the factories, and will endeavour to settle them, in the first instance, in consultation with the local food commissioner. If local settlement proves impossible, questions will be referred to the Food Section, which will confer with the Ministry of Food.To sum up, the Pood Section is to co-cperate with the Ministry of Pood in seeing that supplies are available for munition workers, and for this purpose its representa-tives will act as liaison officers between the various factories and the Ministry of Pood.
