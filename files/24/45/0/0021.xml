The Committee are taking advantage of the presence of a prisoner of war camp at Tempsford to take possession of 82 acres of neglected land forming part of a neighbouring farm.     The lend will be mole drained and summer-fallowed, and the adjoining water-courses cleaned out.Leicestershire.   The Committee have been authorised to take possession of 600 acres on the Buckminster Estate which has been inspected by an officer of the Technical Division.     It is hoped that the onner will agree to pay for the improvements to be effected, and to terminate the existing tenancies as suggested by the Department^ Inspector.Middlesex.   The Committee have in the last fev; weeks made a careful inspection of the numerous golf courses throughout the county with the result that 215 acres only have been found suitable for cultivation.

or graze the rest of the land.Suffolk, \7est.   In April 1917 the Committee took possession of 220 Peres of land owned and occupied by Lady Malcolm of Poltalloch In February 1918, having brought the land into a good state of cultivation they withdrew from possession.     The otfner has repaid whole of the expenditure incurred on behalf of the Department, and has let the land on lease to the Y.M.C.A.A farm at Walsham-le-billows was In the possession of the Committee for approximately the same period as the above and has nov? been handed back tc the owner rho has le^t it to a farming tenant.

The Executive Committet are anxious to bring into cultivation 600 acres of Ver Office lands at the Durrington rifle ranges, and the Directorate of Lands have given all the help In their power;   but the military authorities have found it impossible to give up the use of this land at present.     They are, however, cultivating sowe 600 acres themselves.    It is state that officers of the Royal Flying Corps stationed at Upavon have purchased a tractor out of their mess funds in order to cultivate adjacent land for the production of vegetables, Cardiganshire.    The Committee report that 75  of the grass land scheduled for ploughing has now been ploughed. Drainage of Lands,   The Nottinghamshire Executive Committee have issued notices for the cleansing of the Langor, Orston and Thrampton Dykes, and the Warwickshire Committee for the cleansing of the drains and ditches on the Karwlckshire Moor.

Horticultural Organisation.     Satisfactory reports have been recei&quot; of work accomplished in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Cheshire,
Cornwall, Oxfordshire, Shropshire and Herefordshire.The Representative at Aylesbury reports that 12 additional acres of allotments are being cultivated in the district this year.At Birkenhead there are 52 groups of allotments, each supervised by an expert, and at Chester 10 groups, each supervised by two skilled gardeners.     In nearly all cases reports show a marked increase in the number of allotments provided for the coming year.Tomato Seed. A gift of 10 lbs. of tomato seed received by the Department from Canada has been distributed to amateur growers. Applications have been received from 22 counties and 167 one ounce packets have been dispatched.Sunflowers.   Steps have been taken to encourage the planting of sunflowers in land not used for food crops.   The Ministry of Food is re-considering the price fixed for sunflower seed, (i.e. 28/-per cwt).Fruit Section.   Arrangements have been made with wholesale firms for nicotine and other chemicals used for the spraying of fruit trees to be supplied in small quantities suitable for small growers.The Ministry of Food has agreed-to take one million -baskets from the Employers1 Federation of Basket Makers provided that Treasury sanction can be obtained.    At Evesham 20 prisoners of war, skilled in the art of basket making are working for the Evesham Market Gardeners1 Association.     The Installation of the basket factory at Dartford is being delayed owing to the fact that the War Office contemplate using the buildings concerned for other purposes.Fruit and Vegetable Preserving.   104 demonstrations have been given during the week and exhibits have been provided for two Food Economy exhibitions.Glass Jars for Fruit Preserving.   The number of glass jars ordered
from manufacturers by retailers throughout the country is 3i I million. The number distributed by the manufactuers up to the ] 2nd March is 545,000.Provision oft hand for Allotments.   The Allotment Inspectors visits! 36 local authorities during the past week.   Steps are being taken by these authorities to acquire an additional 618 acres of ground which will provide for 9,000 allotments.The Y.M.CA. is taking active steps to encourage the     , production of food in connection with the 500 huts belonging to the Association In this country. iReports received from 1,125 districts show that 264,975 applications have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2), and that 237,916 plots containing 17,340 acres have been provided.The Department have entered on part of the $rounds fattached to an unoccupied dwelling house in Cheltenham, and have authorised the Town Council to arrange for the cultivation of this land as allotments.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Inspection of Land.   Part of the Bpwland area of Best Yorkshire was inspected In connection with an application received from the Agricultural Executive Committee for advice as to the desirability of carrying out an extensive scheme of drainage. Host the land^ was formerly under the plough, and sod drained, but as t! prices of crops fell the land ceased to be cultivated and draining .&apos;was discontinued. Practically the whole of.this land Is now in grr.i of very poor quality, and requires draining as a preliminary measure.   There are hundreds of acres at present worth not more than 5/- or 7/6 an acre which could be made into pasture worth  1 an acre by drainage and subsequent treatment.    The Department are, considering whether b sufficient supply of prisoner labour can be
made available to undertake a drainage scheme&apos; on a large scale. It is doubtful if the district will ever be able to contribute largely to the corn supplies, but in the interests of the winter supply of dairy produce a considerable increase in the area of ploughed land is called for.Lectures *    (1) The Northamptonshire Chamber of Agriculture was addressed on methods of breaking and cropping grassland, with special reference to causes of failure and means of obviating them(2) A lecture on methods of feeding pigs on house refuse was given at Kampstead.Seed Testing Station.   The total number of samples received up to date is 5,778, and reports have been Issued in respect of 4,945. The number of tests running is about 900, which engages the full capacity of the incubators.   Reports on 1,200 tests have been issued during the past fortnight.   The total cash receipts to date amount to nearly  625.   Nearly 1,000 seedsmen and farmers have sent samples to the station.LABOUR DIVISION.Soldier Labour.   Under the recent 7ar Office decision to release further skilled men in exchange for the unskilled soldiers still due to the Department under the Cabinet decision of the 27th June last, 750 additional skilled men have arrived at the Distribution Centres during the. week.   These men are arriving at a rate quite inadequate to meet the universal demand for ploughmen and other skilled agricultural workers.   It is important that the additional skilled men to be supplied should be provided without delay.An additional 200 of the ploughmen on three months1 agricultural furlough from overseas 7/ent back duringJthe week, leaving 1,050 on the land, but ail these men are returning to France almost immediately.   Exclusive of these men, the number of soldiers attached to Depots to date Is 37,777 (26,395 so-called &quot;skilled51 and 10,882 unskilled).    Of these men 34,026 (25,587 skilled and 8,439 unskilled) arem out on farms.

The Farm Institutes at Lleweni Hall, Carnarvon, and Newton Rigg, Cumberland, have again offered to train recruits during this season, and the two centres at Bawtrey, Yorkshire, and at Gately, Norfolk, are re-opening immediately.Efficiency tests have been held in the various training centres in the three Ridings of Yorkshire.    These tests are now a recognised portion of the training curriculum, and take place at every centre at least once in six weeks.     Reports show that the results of these tests are exceedingly good.At the Ploughing Demonstration at Wetherby, Yorkshire, held last week, there was a very good attendance, especially of farmers, who watched all the proceedings with great interest. Very complimentary comments were made, and the farmers openly expressed their approval of the ploughing and stated they were surprised that such work had been accomplished by the women when using strange herses and ploughs.   The conditions were 6* deep ploughing 8&quot; wide, and attention was paid by the judges to the general management of the horses, the state of the plough, turning, straightness, evenness, time and style.7,008 women are accounted for as members of the Land Army as follows:-In Instruction CentresOn farm work...............Employed on Forage .........Timber ...................Waiting for references to be313 .5,777451 155placed in Training Centres Waiting in Depots ...........Waiting in their homes ......98 37 1777,008

One Unit of four tractors in the same county ploughed 126J acres in one week, with an average consumption of 3.6 gallons per acre.      Overtime 4906 ploughed 25^ acres on the low averagj consumption of 2.82 gallons.Surrey - Tractor 578 ploughed 41 acres in 65 hours,Lincolnshire (Kesteven?- - On very difficult frosty land, 3-       - 19tractors ploughed 22 acres each in the week, two of them completing the work in 50 hours.
Hereford - Tractor 1550 ploughed 3$ acres in the week ending March 1st, and 61 acres in the following week. Yorks - West Riding - One tractor ploughed 29 acres, working 55 hours, also doing a 25 mile journey.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Superphosphate.   A number of large works in Lancashire have&apos; recently been inspected.   These works, up to the present time, have had very large stocks on hand which oould not be dispatched to consumers owing to railway and labour difficulties.   The release of men from munition factories has solved tho labour difficulty to a groat extent, and an effort to get rid of these surplus supplies has been made by giving priority to fertiliser traffic temporarily over all other goods, with the result that the position has bean greatly improved.   The demand for superphosphate has. recently fallen off, but enquiries have been received from many allotment holders.Stable Manure * tThe distribution of manure from remount depots proceeds satisfactorily.   Several complaints as to the non-utilisation of manure have, been investigated and found to be without foundation.   A difficulty has been experienced at a number of dumps owing to the lack of Army transport, but a large number of wagons are now being devoted to this purpose,Lime.   The demand for lime is very great and difficulties have arisen in securing railway transport.   The Railway Companies are not obliged to oarry lime in their own trucks, but the attention of the Railway Executive Committee hag been drawn to the importance of this traffic, and tho Committee has been requested to circularise the Railway Companies, asking them to give sympathetic consideration to applications for trucks to be used for this purpose. TlnplatC3 for Insecticide Tins.   The restrictions Imposed by the Ministry of Munitions on.the supply of tinplates are very severe, but an application has been made for the allocation to the
Department of 28 tons for the manuf%fture of tins far Insecticide As these materials contain acid, they cannot be packed in cartons and similar substitutes far tin, but makers are being urged to us glass bottles and earthenware jars as far as possible.     The manufacturers of Insecticides anticipate a large demand this year Mre Netting.   Applications for the supply of wire netting have increased, and the allocation of steel has been temporarily exhausted.    The importance of supplies has been strongly impress on the Ministry of Munitions and it is hoped that a further suppl of steel will shortly be obtained.    The suggestion has been made that the guage of the wire generally used for this purpose should be reduoed and the Department has agreed that a thinner type of wire could easily be used.Corn Sacks.   A conference was held at the V-ar Trade Department in regard to the supply of bags for various trades, especially co sacks for the use of farmers after threshing.    The Director of Raw Materials, who controls the supply of bags, states that there is no reason to suppose the supply will be short, but the matter is being investigated with a view to ensuring a sufficient supply for next harvest.Binder Twine.    The Inorease in the price of binder teine from 115/- to 120/- per cwt. which has been under discussion for some time with the Ministry of Munitions, has now been settled in agreement with the manufacturers and dealers.    This increase In price has become necessary in order to cover increased costs of manufacture and distribution, but it will not apply to any trine which has already been bought by farmers, whether delivered or no Farmers were urged In October last to place their orders early an it Is stated by the trade that the iralority of the twine has aire been purchased.Seed Yftieat.     The arrangements for the distribution of Ho. 1 Northern Manitoba wheat are now completed.     The price rill not exceed 110/- per quarter of 480 lbs. ex store Liverpool.
Seed Mal2e.     The Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies have set aside 1,000 tons of Plat White African maize for seed purposes and arrangements are being made for its distribution through Approved Agents and selected Storage Agents,Seed Oats,   The total number of licences issued during the week was 520, of Which 342 were for seed (14,231 quarters);   41 for milling (2,410 quarters) and 137 general licences for the Import of seed oats into the southern and western counties of Englan d. Since the Export Restriction Order became operative, 3,810 licences have been issued for 189,189&apos;auarters of seed, in addition to the general licences, Supply of Seed Oats.(1)   White Oats Of the Abundance Type from the Isle of Man.8,230 quarters bought. 5,812 quarters sold.(2)   Irish Black Tartarian Oats.15,328 quarters bought 14,050 quarters sold.The Department anticipate that during the next fortnight at lease 600 tons will be received, but they have been disappointed in the arrival of certain cargoes, which has interfered seriously with deliveries during the pa3t week. (3)   Scottish White Oats.4,363 quarters bought. 2,273 quarters sold.The demand for white oats for sowing appears to be distinctly on the decline.Potatoes.   Seed Supply.   The total quantity of seed potatoes ordered forward up to the 9th March was approximately 24,000 tons, and the total quantity delivered or shipped was 9,000 tons. Wart Disease.    Applications for licences to plant potatoes In land scheduled for wart disease are decreasing, but a large proportion contain Irregularities which necessitate further enquiries and therefore delay the issue.,of licences.     Most of this work will be avoided next season as, under the forthcoming Wart Disease Order, it is proposed to make regulations by which licences to plant potatoes will be unnecessary in the majority of cases.
Instances have come to the notice of the Department in which seed potatoes have apparently been imported into tho restricted district of South Wales and Monmouthshire in contravention of the tfart Disease of Potatoes (Restricted Distric Order of 1917 No.l.   A serious vie:; is taken of such breaches of-the Order, as it is essential in the interests of food productior that the provisions of the Order should be observed. Potato Spraying.   The Local Government Board have issued a notice through the Press empowering the Councils of Borough, Urban and Rural Districts and Parishes to purchase spraying machines and chemicals, out of local funds, but suggesting that a suitable one should be made for the use of same.   Ninety-eight lectures were given by Spraying Organisers all over the country during thG past week.Seed Control - 180 Seed Firms have been visited up to date in connection with the Testing of Seeds Order by Inspectors of this Department.   Of these firms, 100 are complying with the requlremc in every respect.   The necessity of complying with the order ha3 been urged on the remaining 80 firms, and further visits will be paid to them at a later date.Arrangements are being made through the County Educate Authorities for the Agricultural Organiser, or other suitable-official, in each county, to draw the attention of agriculturist! to the facilities offered by the Official Seed Testing Station, and the protection afforded them by the Testing of Seeds Order. It has been suggested that these offioers should (i) arrange meetings of farmers for the purpose of explaining the terms of the Order;   (ii) ascertain whether farmers are receiving a declaration as to germination, purity, etc required under the Order;     (iii) report cases where they have reason to believe tftj) the terms of the order are not being complied -fith;     and (iv) u:
farmers to send samples te the Official Seed Testing Station. Buckwheat - Steps are being taken to obtain control of such supplies of Buckwheat as are available, with a view to distribution for seed purposes only.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland  * Prothero, M.l*.President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
