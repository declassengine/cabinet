March 1918SECRET.G.T.-3977. 1QTHE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending the 20th March, 1918.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.The discharge of women munition workers, and the miners&apos; ballot on the comb-out are discussed.Part II: Press Comments.The opinion of the Labour press on foreign affairs, specially on Japanese irter-vention in Russia; on shipbuilding; on Labour&apos;s war aims; on man-power: on food; and criticisms of the Government are summarised.,Part III: District Reports.The general situation is still satisfactory, and the trouble connected with the dismissal of J. T. Murphy has now subsided.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a stoppage of work. The strike at Messrs. Denny Brothers, Dumbarton, has now been settled, and also that at the Vulcan Motor Works, South-port, but the strike of aircraft woodworkers in Leeds continues. Somewhat serious cases of strike have occurred in the gas department of the Don caster Corporation on the question of the 12^ per cent, bonus, and among coke-oven workers in the West Riding on a wages question. The employees of the Bradford Corporation tramways are on strike on the question of war bonus.(&amp;.) Not involving a stoppage of work: The employees of the Whitehead Air-craft Company and of the Davidson Aviation Company have both threatened to strike on questions of discipline, and the ironmoulders of Scotland on a demand for increased wages.The employees of the Birmingham Corporation in the tramways, gas, and waterworks departments have threatened to strike on a claim arising out of the 12^ per cent, bonus.L-General Remarks. Discharge of Women Munition Workers.The latest returns show that from the 8th February to the 15th March 17,800 women had been discharged from munition works in various parts of the country in batches of 50 or more. Considerable discontent has been aroused in many quarters on the ground that sufficient notice of dismissal was not given to these women; that notice of their impending discharge was not afforded to the Employment Exchanges in time to ensure arrangements being made for their re-employment m other work; that the unemployment benefit of 7s. a week is inadequate to support life at the present time; and that in many cases women were discharged whose homes are at a considerable distance from their places of employment, and no allowance had been made to them for railway fares to enable them to proceed home. A campaign has [1100-21] B
been conducted in the Labour press on the subject, the points indicated being-employed to establish the inadequacy of the arrangements for the demobilisation of munition workers in general..On the 12th March the Ministry of Labour received representatives of the Wqmen&apos;s War Workers (Emergency) Committee. The members of that Committee claimed, inter alia, that the people who had been discharged should be reinstated. Short of this it was claimed that a month&apos;s pay and a free railway ticket to her home should be given to every discharged worker.Such steps as are feasible have been taken by the Ministry in co-operation with the other Departments concerned in connection with these dismissals, and the whole question of the discharge of civil workers both during and after the war has been referred to the Labour Resettlement Committee, who have appointed a sub-com-mittee to deal with it. The Ministry of Munitions has sent a letter to all firms discharging labour, emphasising the necessity to inform the Employment Exchanges, at least a fortnight in advance, of the names and addresses of workpeople whom they propose to discharge, and also bringing to the notice of those firms the necessity of acting in close consultation with the local officers of the Employment Department in the matter, so as to ensure that the discharges are spread over a. sufficient period to enable efforts to be made to find the workpeople other suitable employment. An order of discharge has also been agreed between the two Ministries. It is as follows: (1.) Bad time-keepers.(2.) Women willing to withdraw voluntarily,:(3.) Women who can be found other employment immediately.(4.) Women drawn from other districts.In this connection the following figures applying to the period up to the 5th March were reported by Woolwich as the result of adhering to this order of dis-charge: 847 women had been discharged from the Arsenal; of these 399 did not desire to take up other work, 380 were bad time-keepers, and the balance (88) were discharged on the ground of reduction of output,Of the women discharged about 50 were passed on to the Training Department of the Ministry of Munitions for training in skilled processes,, and ultimate alloca-tion to vacancies offered in aircraft factories and elsewhere ; 12 returned to domestic service, and 50 or 80 applied for work in the W.A.A..O. or the Women&apos;s Land Army.Of the 17,800 women discharged all over the kingdom up to the 15th March, 7,205 women had registered at the Employment Exchanges up to that date, Of these 1,788 have since cancelled their registrations, presumably on the ground that they either have obtained employment elsewhere or do not desire to be found employment; 1,671 have been provided with fresh situations, leaving 3,746 still unemployed and on the Employment Exchange registers.It is anticipated that the ultimate total of discharges of munition workers will be about 40,000. The rate of discharges per day shows a tendency to decrease, it having been 828 per day in the three days ending the 15th March compared with 1,363 per day in the three days ending the 1st March.The immediate problem does not appear to be a very serious one, and unless discharges increase in daily numbers the arrangements now made should suffice to prevent serious unemployment, At the same time this instance of discharged munition workers has revealed the intense interest with which the whole question of demobilisation of munition workers is viewed by the industrial classes. It is there-fore essential that arrangements should be made beforehand to prevent avoidable widespread distress due to unemployment on demobilisation a condition which could scarcely fail to result in grave industrial trouble throughout the country.The Miners&apos; Ballot.In Part I of this report for the 13th February in discussing the man-power question a note of warning was sounded as to the attitude of the miners to the proposals of the Government,   The result of the ballot on the question of the comb-out which has now been received indicates that the warning was justified.    The complete figures are :: In favour of the Governments proposals ... ...      219,311Against the Governments proposals        ... ...      248,065
At the same time, the vote on whether the Federation machinery should be used to facilitate the comb-out or not has had a contrary result, the figures being :-For the use of the Federation machinery  ... ...      189,997Against the use of the Federation machinery        ...      176481Less than two-thirds of the members of the Federation took part in the ballot on the comb-out, and the majority vote was 34.2 per cent, of the total number of members.It would be unsafe to conclude from the result of the ballot that the miners as a body are hostile to a continuance of the war. The majority doubtless included not only all who are animated by pacifist sentiment, but also all those who, for other reasons, are desirous to embarrass the. Government, The position is at present somewhat obscure, and the special Conference of the Federation has remitted the matter to a Committee for consideration. That Committee will report to an adjourned Conference to be held on the 22nd March.The question of this ballot will be discussed more fully in this report next week, when the final decision of the Conference will be available.II.-Press Comments.For elan A if airs.*j jJ- Japanese intervention in Russia again furnishes the Labour and Socialist press with material for extensive discussion.The tone of the comment is even more hostile than previously, though the &quot; British Citizen &quot; has grown more satisfied during the week on the ground that the German menace in Siberia &quot;may conceivably alter the whole trend of civilisation.&quot; Of the other &quot; patriotic &quot; papers &quot; Justice &quot; and the &quot; New Statesman &quot; are significantly silent, while the &quot; New Age&quot; and the &quot; Clarion&quot; are both prepared very reluctantly to accept the situation. The former insists that such territory as Japan may occupy must eventually be returned, while the latter suggests that the real question is whether we had rather have Japan our ally or our enemy, and even goes so far as to mention India as the price which may have to be paid.While the hostile criticism of &quot; Common Sense &quot; is moderate in tone, that of the &quot;Nation &quot; is more unrestrained. It makes use of the incident to point its favourite comparison of President Wilson with the French and British Governments, to the detriment, of course, of the latter. This vehemence is followed by the others, the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; for instance, claims that the incident will &quot;open the eyes of the blindest to the real character of the war,&quot; and that it is the negation of democracy to claim that this is a Avar for democracy, and &quot; secretly to encourage the most militarist and imperialist country in the world to attack the newly established democracy of Russia.&quot; The &quot;Call&quot; talks about the &quot;desperate devices of Imperialism,&quot; and the &quot;Herald&quot; claims that &quot;we are celebrating the anniversary of the Revolution by inciting Japan to make war upon the Russian masses.&quot; Similar hostility is displayed by &quot; Forward &quot; and the South Wales &quot; Pioneer.&quot;More purely Russian affairs receive less attention, though the &quot;Herald &quot; gives a warm welcome to President Wilson&apos;s message to the Congress of Soviets which it regards as &quot;a definite and deliberate repudiation of the British Governments policy.&quot; Exactly the reverse is the attitude of the South Wales &quot; Pioneer &quot; to Sir G. Buchanan&apos;s recent speech.Shipbuilding:.At home the situation revealed by Sir Eric Geddes as existing in the shipyards attracts particular attention. The gravity of the situation is generally realised, but there is Can undoubted tendency to fling back the accusations which were made against Labour, except, perhaps, in the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; which thinks that there has been a lack of &quot; wise and sympathetic co-ordination.&quot; &quot; Forward &quot; says that Sir Eric Geddes took &quot; a purely &quot;employers&apos; view of labour troubles,&quot; and the &apos;-&apos; Call &quot; is indignant that Labour should be &quot; again the scapegoat.&quot; For the most part the attitude of the employers in blaming State control is supported, the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; for example, saving that it &quot; is a mean device (of the Government) to put the responsibility for incompetence on others.&quot; The &quot; New Age,&quot; &quot; New States-man.&quot; and the &quot;&quot;Clarion,&quot; however, are not prepared to exonerate the shipbuilders, and the last named in particular is not inclined to be pessimistic about the situa-tion, claiming that January was an exceptionally unfortunate month.
Labours War Aims.This subject continues to attract attention. The -&quot; New Statesman &quot; is at great pains to point out that the leading article on this subject which appeared in Vorwarts was inaccurately transmitted to this country, as was the war aims memorandum to Germany. The South Wales &quot; Pioneer &quot; &quot;also ooints out t*at the memorandum is &quot; not an ultimatum,&quot; but a basis for discussion.&apos;The &quot;New Witness/5 on the other hand, is convinced that under pressure of recent events &quot; the International has collapsed with something like a universal crash.&quot;Man-Power.Interest in &quot;&quot;man-power&quot; is somewhat diminished. &quot; Justice &quot; thinks that the position as regards the A.S.E. is easier. The &quot; Herald &quot; is of the same opinion, but, as regards the miners, finds the situation obscure, and thinks that &quot; not even the present Government would be prepared to take so drastic a step as to put itself into direct opposition with the miners&apos; organisation &quot; by calling up 50,000 miners without further negotiation. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; is more moderately of a similar opinion.The &quot; New Witness &quot; claims that in the case of the A.S.E. a &quot; compromise has been effected, and Sir Auckland&apos;s face has been saved by the interposition of Mr. George,&quot;&apos;Food.Attention is becoming more and more concentrated on food production as it becomes evident that distribution is being successfully dealt with.&quot;Justice &quot; attacks the farmers, and is convinced that the productive capacity, even of well-kept farms, could be largely increased. The &quot;Nation&quot; is more encouraging, and recommends in particular the cultivation of beans and peas which can be used as substitutes for meat. The &quot; Leeds Citizen &apos;&apos; has been supporting this view for some time, and continues a series of very useful articles on the subject.Mr. Hyndman, in &quot; Justice,&quot; continues to describe the meetings of the Con-sumers&apos; Council, and attacks in particular &quot;the filthy milk anarchy,&quot; suggesting that State management could not possibly fail to be an improvement. The &quot; Herald &quot; has started a rival account, but it is comparatively colourless.The &quot;New Witness &quot; ,keeps up its agitation against bad meat at Smithfield, and attacks Mr. Clynes for refusing to look into the matter. The &quot; Workers Dread-nought &quot; turns its attention to a somewhat similar point, suggesting that the very bad meat which is being sent by the Food Ministry to Poplar is in reality the leav-ings of Surbiton.Criticism of the Government.Criticism of the Government again centres largely round its relations with the press. The feeling about the House of Commons&apos; debate is one of disappointment. The &quot; Herald &quot; accuses everybody of bluffing, and states that &quot; the Prime Minister&apos;s overdraft upon the credulity and servility of his mob of sycophants and placemen was received with uncontrollable derision.&quot; &quot;No one wants Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s job, but some one ought to want it.&quot; &quot; Forward &quot; is also pessimistic as to a successor, and thinks Mr. Asquith is &quot;out of the question.&quot; Even &quot;Justice&quot; has been &quot; forced to the conclusion that the country could not have a more unstable, more unreliable, and more unbalanced politician as Premier than Mr. Lloyd George.&quot; The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; &quot;Common Sense,&quot; and the &quot; Co-operative News&quot; are all dissatisfied with the debate, and the last named claims that the Prime Minister&apos;s efforts to shield himself show that he realises that his &quot; press campaign is not cricket.&quot; The &quot;Call &quot; warns Labour that the situation is critical, and that the &quot; Lansdowne stunt &quot; must at all costs be avoided.Trifs to the Front.The &quot;Herald &quot; contains a remarkable description by Mr. R Palmer of his experiences with the trade union delegation in France. The article is somewhat pessimistic in tone, and is not likely to have a good effect.
III. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.The situation in this district remains somewhat unsettled, a number of small and rather unimportant strikes being reported throughout the area.As regards the question of man-power, it is stated that the A.S.E. executive are now organising another ballot on the Bill; it is thought, however, that whatever the result of this ballot the opposition to the Bill will in realitv prove to be slight.The improvement in the food situation, which has &quot;been evident since the inauguration of the rationing scheme, has been maintained.South- Western.Apart from a strike of joiners at Cowes, the situation in this area is quiet.Discontent is, however, evident in the dockyards at Portsmouth over the decision of the Government to open up new dockyards on the Severn for the con-struction of standard ships. The general view appears to be that the necessary plant and labour are available in the Portsmouth yards, and the men are said to consider it somewhat of an insult that this new type of constructive work is to be undertaken elsewhere. This opinion was voiced in the resolutions of the local Labour Party Conference, at which the delegates represented about 14,000 workmen. It was suggested with regard to the debate on shipping output that the slacking, to which reference was made, was clue rather to the confused methods of the Govern-ment in the allocation of contracts, than to the fault of the employers or workmen.The same conference resolved that the time was now opportune for setting- up a Joint industrial Council in the shipbuilding industry.In all parts of this area there has recently been considerable activity on the part of the Dockers&apos; Union, which is trying to force non-unionists to join it by boycotting and other meansWest Midlands.The situation in this area seems on the whole to be fairly quiet, and few reports have been received.In Birmingham, however, considerable unrest (referred to in Section IV of this report) has been displayed by the tramway and Corporation employees as regards the 12^ Per cent bonus.The food situation in the Black Country is stated to be still somewhat unsatis-factory, though in Birmingham there appears to be less discontent.Yorkshire and East Midlands.There is no diminution of the unrest existing in this district, and a number of strikes and disputes have been reported.A conference was held in London on the 9th March to discuss the effects of the proposed reduction in the top-making programme. It was decided that this reduc-tion should become operative from the 18th March, and that the question of any necessary subsidy was one for the industry, not for the Government. The employers and employees undertook to settle this question themselves.Serious discontent as regards the man-power question still exists at Derby, where it is intimated that the engineers will stand by the May agreement; but on the whole it is thought that even here they will receive little support if they decide upon a strike policy.A meeting of Derbyshire miners was held at Cresswell on the 10th in regard to the same subject, and the general feeling was that the men were not prepared to strike, even if the ballot showed a majority adverse to the Government.Considerable excitement has been manifest in Sheffield over the Murphy case, and the Sheffield Workers&apos; Committee had decided to down tools on the 20th failing his reinstatement. In view of the satisfactory developments at Southport, however, it is unlikely that this threat will be carried out.There has been considerable political activity in the district during the past week in this area. The V/omeirs peaCe Crusade held an important demonstration at Bradford on Sunday, and Messrs. Anderson. M.P.. and Tom Mann have been addressing meetings.[1100-21] C
North-Western.Much angry feeling has.undoubtedly been aroused in this district during the past week over the case of J, T. Murphy, and it was feared at one time that a general strike might take place. The men at Barrow were particularly angry, but the shop stewards do not seem to have felt themselves strong enough to carry out their threat of calling a strike for the 16th, and on Sunday they decided to take action only in conjunction with other centres. The men have, however, now returned to work, and Murphy has been reinstated. The situation might have had ugly developments,&apos; and the solution without further show of force is to be welcomed.The Liverpool Labour Party is at present active, both as regards the food question, upon which an agitation meeting was held on the 12th, and as regards demobilisation and peace problems, upon which propaganda leaflets are being cir-culated with the object of increasing the local membership of the party. At the meeting on the 12th it was&apos; stated that there was no shortage of food among the better classes, and even among the workers the shortage was unnecessary, as food was wasting in cold storage.The I.W.W. of Chicago have forwarded a circular on the usual lines to trade unionists in Manchester, asking them to continue its circulation and to gain recruits to their ranks., The debate upon the question of shipping output has aroused some indignation among the men, and it is pointed out that bad weather and the necessity of standing in the food queues decreased output considerably during January.Northern.There is no serious unrest among the workers in this area.The ironmoulders are again discontented, and are demanding higher rates ofpay.A general feeling of relief is evident among the A.S.E. that a settlement of the man-power controversy is approaching, and at a meeting on the 16th, where the discussion centred chiefly around the age of the dilutees still at work, there seemed to be general agreement that those over thirty-five had a better claim to exemption than the younger members of the A.S.E. A postal ballot is to be taken on these points and upon the Governments revised terms, the result of which is expected to be favourable .Severe weather and the agitation among the moulders upon the 12- - per cent, are mentioned as causes of the decreased shipping output in this area, and at Sunderland it is suggested that too much overtime was also a cause.The Ministry of Munitions reports that a shortage of meat is again evident in the Newcastle area.Wales.Apart from one considerable strike of miners, the situation in this area is fairly quiet.The action of the licensing justices in refusing the renewal of licences to certain public-houses resulted, however, in an agitation meeting to protest against the pro-hibition of the liquor traffic and the present shortage of beer, which was alleged to be causing serious industrial unrest. In return for an increased supply loyal support to the Government in its war policy was pledged by the meeting. There has also been something in the nature of a recurrence of the meat shortage formerly reported as existing in this area.The question of income-tax still seems to cause some discontent among the miners, and a special conference on the subject is desired.The result of the miners&apos; ballot on the &quot; comb-out &quot; and on the question oi using the federations machinery for the purpose shows a majority against the Govern-inenfs proposals.Scotland,This district is somewhat less quiet than during the last few weeks, and a number of small local strikes have taken place.
Sir Eric Geddes&apos; speech upon shipbuilding has been received with considerable indignation by both employers and workmen, as it is considered that the Christmas holidays and the bad weather in January were the main causes of the decrease in output. Lack of building material is also said to have caused occasionally a slackening m the work, and the men are inclined to blame official control, which they think leads to a great deal of unnecessary work in fitting up ships which frequently are never used, or are altered time after time before putting to sea.IV.-DlSFUTES.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The improvement which has been reported during the last few weeks has hardly been maintained.The Shipyard Labour Department reports nine new cases of stoppage of work, involving in all 1,128 men. There are also fifteen old cases standing over from previous weeks.    Settlements have been effected in twenty-one cases altogether.The new cases reported are not of a very, serious nature. Of those to which reference has previously been made, that of the joiners at Messrs. Denny Bros., Dumbarton, has now advanced towards settlement, since, as the result of a conference at the Ministry of Labour, it was arranged that the men should return to work on plain time rates, pending consideration by the Government on the legal action to be taken. The dispute at Messrs. Armstrong, &quot;Whitworth, and Co., Newcastle, mentioned last week, has been referred to arbitration, as the conference proved abortive. As was reported last week, the joiners at Messrs. Harland and Wolffs and Messrs. Workman, Clark, &amp; Co., Belfast, resumed&apos; work pending the consideration of their case. It now appears that the woodcutting machinists, who were also affected, are again becoming restive at the delay in hearing their case.The Ministry of Munitions reports that 4,2/0 men have been involved in stop-pages of work in the week ending the 13th March. Of these the largest number occurred in the North-Western area, where 1,250 men were involved.By far the most important strike has been that at the Vulcan Motor Works, Southport, over, the alleged victimisation of J. T. Murphy, to which reference was made last week. This showed signs of having serious results, as other districts threatened to come out in sympathy. Meetings of the strikers were held on the 15th, and again on the 18th, but proved abortive, the workers adopting a very uncompromising attitude. On the 19th, however, at a further meeting, they decided to return to work to-day (20th) on the under-standing that the management were prepared to meet a deputation of the men on the subject of Murphy&apos;s reinstatement.   Murphy has now been reinstated.The strike of aircraft woodworkers at Leeds, which involves 700 men, still continues. The men are apparently determined to gain their object, which is the application of the national award, and there is no prospect of a resumption of work. It is also feared that aircraft workers in Bradford may cease work. The award has now been issued, and an officer of the Ministry of Munitions is going to Leeds to discuss points arising out of it. About 400 aircraft woodworkers also struck work at Messrs. W. White and Sons, Cowes, as a protest against the suspension of a joiner, and the workers of another firm came out on the 14th in sympathy. Work has, however, been resumed pending the decision of the joiner&apos;s case.    ,The carpenters and builders at Messrs. Thorburn and Co., near Bristol, struck work on the loth owing to the firm&apos;s refusal to remove a foreman to whom objection was made. Enquiries into the matter are now being made by the Trench Warfare Department. About 800 men are involved.A claim for the 12-i- per cent, bonus has caused a strike in the Gas Department of the Doncaster Corporation. The men are willing to accept a Government arbitrator, but to this the Corporation refuse to agree. Steps are, however, being taken to bring pressure to bear upon the Corporation in order to induce them to accept arbitration. Meanwhile at least four firms have had to close down, and a considerable number of men are affected.About 1,500 coke-oven workers in the West Biding struck work on the 13th for an increase in their rates. Twenty firms are involved here. At Messrs. Vickers, Barrow, 400 shell press-workers ceased work through a dispute over a new invention.Strikes involving G00 men at Luton and 300 railway-vehicle repairers in South Wales are also?reported.The War Office Contracts Department has two new stoppages of work to report.One of these, at Messrs. G. Groom, Ltd., Gracechurch Street, involves about 100 women of the Workers&apos; Union employed upon tent-making; they struck work on account of the discharge of a male cutter.In the building trade, workmen of the Lincoln district have demanded an increase of M. per hour, in spite of the recent award of the 12* per cent, bonus. The Employers&apos; Associations are expressing much dissatisfaction at the delay in setting up Wages Boards to deal with wages questions in Government building contracts.
oIn the Manchester district 750 builders engaged on the construction of an aircraft factory are also on strike over the 12J per cent, bonus, which has not been previously paid in that district.The Coal Controller reports a short stoppage which involved 5.000 men at the Ebbw Vale Co.&apos;s collieries. The dispute is now, however, being dealt with by the local machinery, and the men have returned to work.Several short stoppages have occurred in Lanarkshire, and in three collieries the men are still idle.The total figure for the men affected by the nine stoppages which have occurred during the week &quot;is as high as 11,000. In seven cases, however, a resumption of work has been secured.The employees on the Bradford Corporation Tramways struck on the 16th with regard to the war bonus payable to female employees. The whole of the tram service in the city is stopped in consequence. The strikers have been informed that the case will be referred to arbitration after work has been resumed.This strike is said to have been solely due to the action of the women, and should it succeed it is thought locally that it will have a bad effect on the women working in the textile trades in the West Riding, who are agitating for an all-round increase in wages.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Shipyard Labour Department reports thirty-three new controversial cases and 180 old; thirty-three cases out of the total number have already been settled.At Creole the employees of Webster and Bickerton, the Goole S. and E. Co., and the Ouse S. and E. Co. are refusing to work after 5 p.m. unless arrangements are made to give them proper air-raid warnings.There is an increase in the number of controversial cases reported this week by the Ministry of Munitions.About 8,000 employees of the Whitehead Aircraft Co. threatened to strike in order to secure the dismissal of the chief engineer, who was alleged to have interfered in the manage-ment of the works. The stoppage was, however, averted by an agreement that he should in future act merely as consulting engineer.The dismissal of a shop steward at the Davidson Aviation Co., Hammersmith, caused the threat of a strike, which the firm stated might involve 27,000 workers in the West London area. The notice of dismissal was withdrawn pending an enquiry into the circum-stances.The ironmoulders of Scotland have demanded an advance of 100 per cent, on pre-war rates, and more recently 30 per cent, on piece prices. Upon this question they demand two separate arbitrations, while the Employers&apos; Federation desires one for both questions. Notices have been handed in involving about 1,500 men.The London electricians have decided not to strike hi connection with their demand for the 12-J- per cent, bonus, and the dispute has been referred to arbitration.The War Office Contracts Department reports only one new controversial case.This has arisen out of an application to Messrs. E. and J. Richardson. Elswick Leather Works, for an increase in wages varying from Is. for skilled and semi-skilled hands to Qid. for labourers.The clothing trade are making an organised attempt to secure big increases in wages, amounting to 18s. per week for men and 12s. for women. An award has been granted by the Committee on Production as recently as last October.A serious situation has arisen at Birmingham owing to claims arising out of the 121 per cent, bonus which have been put forward by Corporation employees on the tramways and in the Gas and Waterworks Departments. The tramwaymen had handed in then- notices, but these have been suspended, and the Ministry of Labour is enquiring into the matter.The number of new differences reported to the Chief Industrial Commissioner is about 192. of which seventy-four are claims for the 12^ per cent, bonus. Of the total seventy fall within the engineering and metal trades group.The Scottish building trade and the drug and chemical trades have made agreements on the lines of the engineering trades agreement to provide for a four-monthly consideration of a general change of wages by the Committee on Production.The Committee on Production have heard forty-eight arbitration cases during the past week, twenty-seven in London and twenty-one in Scotland. In addition, sitting as a special Arbitration Tribunal, it heard &quot;two cases arising out of the 12^ per cent, award.D. J. SHACKLETON.
