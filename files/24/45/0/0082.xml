SEGHgTyIntelligence Bureau,Department cf Information.CFX/040.WEEKLY REPORT ON RUSSIA. XL.(20 March, 1918).The ratification of the Peace Treaty by the Moscow Conference of Sovyets is an enormous personal victory for Lenin;    it is a further proof that his personal influence is far greater than that cf any of the other leaders.   During the Brest negotiations Lenin was in a minority, and was willing, though under protest, net to press his views to the point of resignation, but during the last fortnight he has staked everything on the triumph of his point of view.    It is true that there have been secessions from the party, and that the Left Social Revolutionaries have refused to accept the responsibility for the ratification, yet the fact remains that the results of the voting - 704 to 261 - are a decisive vote of confidence in Lenin&apos;s policy.Lenin&apos;s actions during the last fortnight prove him to be more of a realist than any of his followers who have lately played a prominent part.   On March 7 he wrote as follows in Pravda-    &quot;Any attempt to fight now would make matters still worse, and it is those who foster illusions that are responsible for Russia getting a far worse peace than that originally offered at Brest&quot;.At first Trotski seemed inclined to lead a war party in opposition to Lenin, but it soon became obvious that no such party could gain any support in face of Lenin&apos;s crushing arguments in favour of peace.   After the German advance Trotski had himself to admit that the Russian armies, as at present constituted, could not fight, and a new army could not be formed without some breathing-space.   On the other hand, Trotski seems to have been very con-scious of the lamentable impression that would be made on public
opinion both in Germany and bestern Europe by such a complete sur-render as the signing of the Peace Treaty of March 3.     Lenin seems to have remained indifferent \o any sentimental eonsiderations.     In his eyes public opinion abroad, in so far as it finds open expression in the press, is already so hostile to the Bolsheviks that no beau geste such as a refusal to ratify the peace could make any appreciable difference.    On the other hand, public opinion in Russia is of vital importance to the success of the Bolshevik policy. The peasants as a whole are simply war-weary, and it would not be easy to force them into a war for revolutionary ideals, so.long as they thought it was merely the fanaticism of the Bolsheviks that stood in the way of peace.   There are signs that the workmen in the cities, who are much more developed politically than the peasants, are willing to fight for revolutionary ideals, and it is they Fho are the backbone of the Bolshevik party, but this is not the case with the peasants unless they are convinced   that the Bolsheviks have done everything possible to secure peace and that the war is only resunBd because of German aggression.Though peace has been formally ratified it is almost incon-ceivable that it can be kept for long. . Peeling against the Germans is likely to harden on closer acquaintance, especially as they come into Russia entirely on a counter-revolutionary basis, viz. in the interests of the big landowners and industrialists.    It has sometimes been suggested that the longing for order is now so strong in the heart   of the ordinary Russian that the Germans will be welcomed with relief.   This could only be true as regards the bourgeoisie and the small shopkeeper clasa, certainly not in the case of the working men.   T*ith regard to the peasants it is true that their main desire must be to settle down on the land they have now appropriated by force, and if the Germans would guarantee the land to the peasants they might conceivably win some of themt
to their side.   The difficulty, however, will be that the Germans will have to choose between revolution and counter-revolution in Russia.   They cannot hold out one hand to the bourgeoisie and the other to the peasants;   further, if in Russia they gave the land to the peasants, there would immediately be an outcry for the land in territories with a large peasant population further west. German policy, therefore, is likely to try to win the bourgeoisie and to attempt to penetrate the country by slow stages.   The chief obstacle in their way in such a case will be the fanaticism of the Bolsheviks.    So long as this party keeps its end up there will be a nucleus in the country round which anti-German elements can group themselves.     The Bolsheviks themselves admit that it will be a slow process, but they are confident that in the long run the fighting strength of the people will revive.   Lenin compares the pfesent peace to the Peace of Tilsit9   Russia, he says, accepted far more humiliating terms during the Napoleonic wars, but recovered her strength in a few years.   He admits, however, that at the pre^n day the march of events is much more rapid.    These men who have worked for years in exile are not likely to lose their faith in the ultimate triumph of their ideas, and no matter how humiliating the peace may be and how desperate the economic conditions, they are likely to proceed with the execution of their Socialist ideas. They feel that once the proletariat has tasted power and has realise its own strength.it will never be willing to return to former ccn-ditions.    The Russian workman is by temperament more extreme than in other countries;   further, factories in Russia are organised on a large scale, and the workmen are therefore more open to political propaganda.    In a book written after the 1905 Revolution, Trotski mentions this as a fact of great political importance, giving it as an explanation of the revolutionary force and
organisation of the working class.It is impossible to say What resistance the Bolsheviks can put up against the Germans at the present stage *   Ho matter how great their revolutionary fervour, their position now is a desperately difficult one.     Their only hope of rallying the masse is on a purely revolutionary basis, and they will do everything in their power to represent German aggression in this light.   In so far as they are threatened by Germany they are willing at the eleventh hour to co-operate with Britain and America, but the question of Japanese intervention in Siberia will cut right acroei any such proposals.    It will obscure the issues, putting the Allies on the same level in the eyes of the ordinary Russian as the Germans, and this will go a long way towards cooling^lhe indignation against the Germans which otherwise the Bolsheviks would do their best to promote.    If the Japanese enter Siberia the Bolsheviks will, it is maintained, treat them as enemies just as much as the Germans, and it is not unlikely that the result will be the fall of the Bolsheviks, leaving no party in a position to succeed them,   This would give the Germans the opportunity they desire of setting up a &quot;tame&quot; Government in Russia, without any organised force to withstand it, with the result that the present peace, signed and ratified under protest, might be converted into a peace by understanding.20.3,18.
