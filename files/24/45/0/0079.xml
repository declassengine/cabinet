TRANSFER OF THE CONTROL OF REFRIGERATED MEAT TO THE MINISTRY OF FOOD.

Note by Mr. Austen Chamberlain on Memorandum by the Food Controller (G.T. 3849).

I think Lord Rhondda&apos;s proposal is right and desire to support it.

The allocation of cargoes to the Allies by the Board of Trade without consultation with the Meats and Fats Executive is clearly wrong and destroys the effectiveness of the whole Inter-Ally machinery.

(Intld). A.C.
