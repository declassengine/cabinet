TO THE MINISTRY OF FOOD. &apos; ^, i^/     Memorandum by the Food Controller.I regret that the Army Council appear to have misunderstood my Memorandum of March 8th (G.T.3849).   I am afraid I cannot accept the arguments in their Memorandum of March 16th nor their suggestion that my statements are Inaccurate.There are only two points of importance:-(1)   The fact that agreements made by the Board of Trade with France and Italy gravely Imperil the food situation in this country, and(2)   The fact that the allocation of supplies to France and -. Italy under those agreements is made by the Board of Trade without reference to the needs of the vcivil population at the moment for which this Department is responsible.The agreement with France appears to have been made for the period of the War and 3 months after; that with Italy is renewable every six months and expires on 31st March, 1918.My view is that the Italian agreement should not be renewed, and that the French Government should at once be approached with a view to the termination of the French agreement.   Supplies of meat to France and Italy should be allotted through the Meat and Fats Executive in accordance with the recognised practise which prevails in regard to all other foodstuffs. -The need for this procedure is rendered clear by the action of the Board of Trade in sending in the month of January, (at a time when the supply of meat in this country was dangerously low,)2,300 tons of meat to Italy in excess of their obligations.   ThestatementArmy Council affirm that this/is a mistake,   I therefore quote the following extract from a report on meat supplies In the month of January forwarded to me by the Board of Trade:-Italian Army/
