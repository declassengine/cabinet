9 B   %&amp; SfSJWm^. (This Document is the Property -His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government-112March 8 * 14. 19X8.1. ^glig^jfej IgggMM;        ^he United States liar Oracle Board are inclined to break off the negotiations with Benjg^rk, in view of the unreasonable attitude of the Danish Government. We are, however, anxious that the general embargo against f;en-jsark should not be indefinitely continued,   *he Allies would run the risk of alienating their well wishers in the Scandina-vi&amp;n countries, and Denmark would become economically depend-ent upon Germany.   The chief difficulty in the negotiations is that the Banish Government refuse to authorise   the araploy-ment in tho danger sons of   80,000 tons of Danish Shipping which the United States require for that purpose.   The objoc-tlon taken is that Germany would resent this concession.   But the two chief shipping conpairi.es in Denmark are prepared to supply these 80,000 tons   by a private arrangement with tho united States which will not compromise their Government.    It is possible that this offer may save the situation.   ffhe Danish Government have already withe raven the proposal that the Agree-raent should be concluded for six months only.Tho demand that Sweden should put restrictions on the ex-port of iron ore to Germany is still very unwelcome to the Swedish Government, who declare that they must consult Berlin on the subject.    ?he German expedition to the Aaland Islands has irritated Sweden;   but it has also increased her fear o   a Gorman campaign against Swedish merchant shipping,   rweden can afford to delay her decision tor a few weeks, since the bread rations Of the population are assured up to tho end e   June. Sooner or later the Swedish Government must choose whether they will rely upon the United States or upon the Ukraine for the 70,000 tons of cereals which are required between the end of June and this new harvest.     It is not unlikely that they are
waiting for the reports of the export eoxaaias loners whom Germany is sending to investigate tho Ukrainian grain stocks.   If these reports are unfavourable Sweden eon hardly afford to trifle any longer with the iiaerloan proposals.Iforway is probably in no such danger from the side of Gors^ny as tho Norwegian negotiators pro tenet *    Germany has not made any specific threats, but has merely stated that, she would be dis-aatisfled if a llorwegian American agreement were ooncluded* ferway has replied by pleading M force taajetire&quot;, and it is probable that 11* Xhlen will accept the Agreement after some further shov? of resistance.The Betherlands Government object to the demand that all Dutch ships which are chartered to the Allies, under the proposed shipping agreement shall be liable to be employed in the danger zone.   We and the United States propose, If this objection is not withdrawnt to requisition all the Dutch vessels which are within our respective jurisdictions.     This intention was cor-muniected to the Netherlands Government on Mareh 7th, and is eemi-of Xie ially announced in the Lone on newspapers of larch 12. The final reply of the Netherlands Government need not be given before larch 10*     It is possible that Germany may allow thorn to concede our point.    A large number of Duton-ovmed Bhlne barges are urgently required for th, inland waterways of Germany;   and the Netherlands Government, who have already agreed to release these barges in exchange for Additional supplies of coal, might reasonably threaten to go hack upon the bargain, unless Germany becomes mor   reasonable on the question o   the Chipping Agreement.The British negotiations for a losn frees gwltserlt-nt&quot; have entered on another phase.   Oe now off or to authorise the cmploy-ment of 60,000 tons   of shipping in the Swiss import truce.   We do not undertake to fine the shipping, and we shall not allow the Swiss to charter enemy vessels which ere interned in neutral ports.      But ii other vessels are procured, we will give thorn
bunkers and other facilities, and will abstain from requisitioning them. Furthermore we will refrain from closing our ports against Swiss silks and embroideries, if the loan is granted.

This is our final offer: if it is refused we shall make no further efforts to obtain the loan.

The financial agreement between Spain and France gives the latter a credit of 350,000,000 pesetas for the current year. The rate of interest, which will be settled between the French and Spanish banks concerned, is not to exceed 7\\1//2. French Treasury Bonds are to be given as collateral security.  The agreement between Spain and the United States was ratified at Madrid on March 7, and will be operative till the end of 1918. The thirteenth Article provides that a further agreement may be negotiated regarding tonnage, and we are urging the United States to take advantage of this opportunity.

As for the Argentine, President Irigoyen is said to have decided against a formal breach with Germany. But he is prepared to facilitate the exportation of Argentine produce to the Allied countries under "a tacit commercial agreement".  R.M. Government are prepared to supply the Argentine with British coal for the next four months, if the ships which take out coal are allowed to bring back ?;  but the coal will not be available on any other terms. This arrangement gives us a reasonable security that our share of Argentine produce will be forthcoming.



RUSSIA. The new commercial treaty between Germany and Finland makes it imperative that no goods of military importance should be allowed to reach Finland by any routes which we control.  A Finnish Liquidation Committee are disposing by auction of all the merchant ships and all the stores of oils, metals and machinery which are lying at Helsignfors, and a syndicate of Jews financed by German capital is prepared to buy largely. They will be opposed by another syndicate in which Allied interests are preponderant.
H.M. Government are preparing to offer the Provisional Government at Archangel between 5,000 and 6,000 tons of foodstuffs and textiles in return for some of the more important stores (ferro-alloys, tin, cooper, flaxseed) aeroplane engines) which are still lying at that port. Probably no exchange can be effected before the ice melts. But the Bolshevik commissioners at Archangel are at present only removing foodstuffs, and we may yet succeed in recovering the stores which would be of special military value to the Germans.

An Austro-German group of bankers is opening a National Bank in the Ukraine, with a capital of twenty million marks. There is a brisk demand in Berlin for the prior obligations of the Ukraine railways.

?. NETHERLANDS. The German Government have now established an effective control over Dutch trade with Scandinavia. Dutch shipowners and traders are signing declarations in a form prescribed by the Germans, to the effect that the goods which they bring from Scandinavia to Holland will not be allowed to reach the Allies, or be used for their benefit.  Those who purchase from the importers are required to sign similar declarations.   The importers must submit their books to the German Government when required to do so.  Any Dutch vessel which carried Scandinavian goods not covered by a declaration is liable to seizure by the Germans. For the moment the Netherlands Government have prohibited sailings to Scandinavia.

We are asking the N.O.T. to make an agreement with us fur the regulation of this Dutch-Scandinavian trade, in order that none of the Dutch imports in question may reach enemy countries.



?. SWITZERLAND. The Allies have demanded that the export of cotton tissues from Switzerland to Germany shall cease; they are willing, however, to permit an increased export of Swiss embroideries.
