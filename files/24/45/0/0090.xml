NAVY MB ARMY CANT3EH BOARS.Memorandum &quot;by Mr.Austen Chamberlain. (Prepared in accordance with 7?ar Cabinet 366,Minute 15).In accordance with the directions of the Cabinet I submit a memorandum on the points raised in our discusaion last Monday. The memorandum expresses the views of Lord Buckmaster and myself,     I have not thought it right to ask the American Board, as a Board for any expression of opinion on the subject.It will be observed that the memorandum is confined to the Home Army.     The Prime Minister in Cabinet expressed the opinion that enquiry should extend to the Armies in the field.     On this -subject Lord Bucknaster and I have no observations to offer.As regards the Home Army the relevant facts are as followsThe wholo of the Home Army receive the following daily rations from the Army Service Corps.Meat 1Q ozs. Bacon 2 ozs.Sugar 11/7 oz.Tea 3/8tha oz.Bread 14 ozs. Salt i oz.In addition each man received 5-j-d. worth of supplies in kind through the Uavy and Army Canteen Board amongst which is 1 l/?th ozs. of offal r find a liberal allowance of fats over and above the fat which goes with the neat and bacon.     Further, in smokes, drinks, chocolate,buns,etc.. there is at tho coffee bars an average expenditure of 5d. a day a head.The Army Service Corps and Navy and Army Canteen Board rations together give each man 3,800 calories.     The ordinary oivilian gets 2,700 calories; a miner is supposed to require-3,500.It will be observed that the ordinary army rations alone are greatly in excosB of those supplied to the civilian. The case for the Navy and Army Canteen Board rations is that thoy provide variety of diet, and that variety of diet makes for contentment;   it is to be noted that they provide a variety which is not enjoyed by the civilian.     The Food Controller has not asked, and we could not provide, money for many of the oom-moditios which figure on the Canteen list.     The question there-fore arises whether it is right to provide for tho Home Army, to wheat moBt of the 40,000 tons from Korth America goes, not0      i.e. tongues, sausages, ana so forth.
AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN %Karen 21st , 1918,only much more than the ei%rilian, but also more variety?     Arc we to find dollars and freight to bring from the United States cf America and Canada articles which the civilian oannot get, when the home army receives more to eat without these extra supplies?     The amount in question over six months is roughly  2,$00,000 and 40,000 tons.It is represented to us that the 600,000 men in the home army can on the merits of their Army Service Corps rations alone spare 2 czs. of meat a day, and that if they are to con-tinue to receive Navy and Army Canteen Board supplies on their present scale, including 1 l/yth ozs. of offal, they ought to spare a further 2 pzs. of meat a day.     &apos;^e recommend that the War Office be offered the alternative of keeping variety and a reasonably large ration by parting with 4 ozs. of meat a day from 600,000 men, or of suffering a drastic restriction of their Navy and Amy Canteen Board supplies.     If we could save 2,400,000 ?zs. of meat a day, this is roughly equivalent to a gift of 2,000 tons a month, and it sets free a valuable ad-dition of rations for the hard manual labourer.In this connection a second point arises to which we think it right to direct tho attention of the Cabinet.     It is well known that as a matter of internal administration a nominal military position is granted by the War Office to men who have in fact in the strict sense of the word no military duties to perform.     It would obviously be outside our province to criticise this arrangement and we do not seek to do so.     But this scheme draws with it a consequence which has a direct bear-ing upon the present distribution of food and our duties in pro-sent ing   the demands of the United Kingdom to the American Re-presentativos.It appears that if once a man is incorporated into the Army, whatever may bo his duties, he becomes entitled to a ration of meat about five times greater than the civilian per-forming tho. same or even more arduous vrork.To feel strongly that in the present state of our food supplies such a position ou^ht not to be continued.    A man&apos;s demand on the limited national resources must be measured by his noeds and not by his uniform.     3y this means only can equality be maintained and injustice avoided.    It is our view that no man who is not &apos;?ith the fighting Army in ?rance or who has not been in the fighting line or is not in training for it ought to occupy   any different position *&quot;ith regard to food from a nan per-forming corresponding work in a civilian capacity.   We have boon informed that before this question came under the notice of the American Board, it was proposed to raise it in the House of Lordst but r*c cannot help thinking that it ib far better that a reform should be made if possible without public discussion, &quot;&apos;hicb will only produce dissension and discontent.   &apos;7ith this view we feel sure that the Cabinet &quot;fill agree, rrA we have, therefore, in-cluded it in the memorandum.The matter is urgent from the point of vio^r of the Canteen Board, for ^hilo wo have allowed the Board1s existing contracts to run on, they are no- falling in and pending thoinvestigation and settlement of their case for expenditure they cannot place ne- orders.
