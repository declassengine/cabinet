14th March, 1918.
Commission   Internationale de Ravitaillement1 have received a copy of Dr. Addisonfs memorandum of tho  6th February on the subject of the proposal circulated by the War Cabinet under No. G/i\3430, that the British ^xe-cutive staff of the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement should bo responsible to the foreign Office.Although i do not think I need express any opinion on the direct question at issue, I may perhaps bo permitted to make the following comments on the arguments advanced by Dr. Addison against the present proposal, namely, that the C.I.H. should not be looked upon either as the adviser of H. M. Gov- : eminent or as tho advocate of tho AlliesDuring the past three years it has been the business of the hritish staff of the C I. R., under my control, to form-ulate tho Allies   demands and lay them before the British Depart-merits concerned, to ensure that all interested parties are consulted, and to see that such demands receive the considera-tion to which they may bs entitled.   In performing this func-tion the C. I. R. Staff has gained a genoral knowledge of Allied requirements and the methods of meeting them, as well as personal experience of the points of view of the various Allies, of which hritish Government Departments have in fact availed themselves.   The foreign Office, in particular, are constantly in the habit of referring for the observations of the C. 1. R. anv representations on the subject of supplies which the-&apos; may receive from tho diplomatic representatives of the allies, tfhile the Treasury have definitely entrusted the C. I. R. with the preliminary investigation of proposed purchases by or for the Allies out of British credits.At the same time the Allies have looked to tho hritish -..;tai&apos;f of the C. I. R. to press claims which have appeared to themnot/
not to be receiving tho fullest consideration, to draw the attention of E.M. Government to circumstances which might have been overlooked in tho natural pre-occupation of individual British Departments with their own pressing requirements, and where necessary to appeal to tho nar Cabinet with whom the Allied Delegates are unable to enter into direct relations. The fact that such appeals have frequently boon successful is in my opinion a proof that tho &quot;advocacy&quot; of some impartial body jjuoh as the British Staff of tho G.I.3., which is not devotod solely to tho interests of cither the claimant or the *. supplier, has been helpful to the equitable distribution of available supplies.In any case the alternative method of &quot;advocaoy&quot;, namely, that exercised by the Foreign Office at the instigation of tho Allied diplomatic representatives concerned, is always available, whether the function is performed by the G.I.R. or not.   If, as is proposed, the British staff of the C I. R, wore attached to the Foreign Office, nothing would be gained by the Allies from attempting to bring special pressure to bear through thoir Ambassadors as the Foreign Uffico would already bo automatically in possession of tho facts of the situation or, if diplomatic assistance were calleu in, would be able in most cases to deal with the representations summprily, by means of informal con-sultation with the Departments principally concerned through tho CI..R. without any cumbrous official formal i ioe:.     I may add that efforts of a similar nature to obtain better co-ordination between the activities of thoir diplomatic and purchasing represent ativos have recently been made by the French and Italian (rovera-ments who have placed their rurchasing Missions in this country under the direct supervision of their embassies.(ira) o.s.
