Printed for the War Cabinet. March 1918.SECRET.G.T.-3910.THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending the 13th March, 1918.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.The position in regard to shipbuilding is discussed.Part II: Press Comments.The opinion of the Labour press on Japan and Russia, on the new Labour Party, on war aims, on food, on man-power, on the dismissal of munition workers, and on the second Lansdowne letter is summarised.Part III: District Reports.The general situation continues satisfactory, and the only prospect of immediate trouble is connected with the dismissal of J. T. Murphy, the well-known Sheffield shop steward, from the Vulcan Works at Southport.The food situation has further improved.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work. The only serious strikes are those of the joiners at Messrs. Denny -Brothers, Dumbarton, which continues; at the Vulcan Motor Works, Southport; and at the Aircraft Works in Leeds. ,   .(b.) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work. iNo very serious disputes are in pro-gress, though there appears to be some danger of the electricians in the Clyde area coming out again in connection with their dispute.-2 r\I. General Remarks.The Shipbuilding Position.Investigation of the history of industrial unrest during the past 12 months, in so far as it concerns shipbuilding yards, discloses the fact that trouble has been frequent on the Clyde and the Tyne, and occasionally serious on the Mersey and in Belfast, while rare at Barrow, Southampton, Hull, and Dundee. The number of strikes on the Clyde has run into hundreds, and though the very large majority are small as to the numbers affected and of short duration, they indicate a constant state of friction and unrest which is detrimental to output. There have, moreover, been several serious and important strikes of which those of the riveters in the month of June, the ironmoulders in the month of September, and the boilermakers in December and January, were the most serious. On the Tyne strikes have also been numerous, but have never attained large proportions, the most important being that of the riveters on standard ships in September last, and of the platers at Armstrong&apos;s during this month. In Liverpool there has been a serious boilermakers&apos; strike, which lasted throughout, the whole of June and July, while at Belfast the plumbers were on strike from September to November, and there was a large stoppage during November and the beginning of December affecting about 5,000 men, and due to the 12^ per cent, advance. In January and February the joiners at Messrs. Harland and Wolff to the number of over 2,000 were on strike. It is noticeable that tendencies to strike are much more frequent on mercantile work than on navy work.[1100-20] B[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government-.]
It is clear that the effect of small strikes cannot be calculated by the number of men affected or the actual number of days or hours during which they are definitely on strike. Before the men leave work there is inevitably an unsettled time during which work is slack, and the prospective strike is debated. Similarly, after their return some time is requisite before work is in full swing again. Apart from these considerations, it also usually happens that any cessation of work affects the output of men in connected trades, who may not be actually on strike themselves.The facts described above provide some explanation of the failure to reach the anticipated programme of production. In addition the circumstances of the year have not been propitious, nor have they favoured the maximum of effort. Large wages have been earned with comparative ease by men whose exertions during the past three years cannot but have tended to weariness. There has, therefore, not been the spur of necessity to overcome the temptation to slackness in work. Reports of slackness have been received in the Ministry from various sources. The following remarks are quoted from a private letter: &quot; The men are simply playing.  You will hear men say they have a fat job,and the foremen connive at it.....Things were bad enough before thewar, but the big money has debauched the men, and I see little hope of better-ment unless every man is put on piece work.&quot;Nor can it be said that the head offices of the unions have always done their best to stimulate production, as they maintain. In this connection the thinly veiled pacifism of recent articles by the Secretary published in the &quot; Boilermakers&apos; Journal &quot; go far to impugn that patriotism by which Mr. Hill believes himself to be animated. The fact has not escaped the notice of the employers, and attention has been drawn to the articles by certain of their Federations.The vigorous attempts made by the Shipyard Labour Department and the Ministry of Labour during the early months of 1917 to introduce general systems of payment by results in the shipyards were met by strenuous opposition of certain unions, although it was known that many of their members were actually working on systems of payment by results. On the other hand, the troubles arising out of piece prices have been numerous. The riveters&apos; price list on the Clyde, which appeared to work with comparative satisfaction to both sides during peace, proved to be a very thorny document when considered by the critical acumen of a legal tribunal. This price list has been responsible for a large amount of the unrest and for a considerable number of the strikes in that important area. In addition, the granting of the 12% per cent, advance has recently led to very serious trouble, and its aftermath is now apparent in a widespread effort on the part of trades which have hitherto regularly worked on piece-work to change the system to a time-work basis, on which, with the aid of the 12% per cent, advance, it is believed larger wages can be earned with the less exertion.But the fault does not by any means lie entirely on the side of the workman. Cases have arisen in which the employer has been seriously to blame notably that at Beardmore&apos;s yard, to which attention was drawn in this report for the week ending the 9th January, 1918. Other cases have come to notice, of which, perhaps, the most important was that of the riveters when the Committee on Productions award on the question of the riveters&apos; price list was so interpreted in certain quarters as to cause an actual reduction of earnings in many cases. Even in the better managed yards there have sometimes been cases in dealing with employees which would not bear close examination.There can also be little doubt that the system of Government control, which has been inevitable under the circumstances of the war, has not been congenial either to $ the employers or the employed. It has in the case of the employers interfered with their freedom of management of the yards, and has limited the profits which they * otherwise might have amassed. Labour control in all essential trades has doubtless been irksome,- and has, perhaps, not conduced to that good feeling in the workshops which is essential to maximum output.In November last the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and representatives of the shipyard trade unions came together to consider the question of output. They have published in the papers of the 13th March a manifesto giving the history of their action in the matter. Though any attempt on the part of employers and employed at joint action and co-operation to imorove the outturn of shipbuilding must be regarded as most laudable, it is pertinent in the present case to remark that their co-operation  since their joint committee was formed has not been successful in
preventing serious strikes, such as that of the boilermakers on the Clyde during last December and January, or of the joiners at Dumbarton during the last month, it would appear, therefore, that the joint body is not sufficiently powerful to maintain peace between its own constituent members.It has been suggested that the question of the output of shipping, and the recent failure to reach the&quot; anticipated standard, should form the subject of an enquiry. There is little doubt that an impartial and searching enquiry on the Clyde would pro-duce rather striking results, and would expose many of the root causes of the poor output and incessant stoppage. What seems, however, to be equally important is that steps should be taken to improve matters. The success of the tank campaign in popularising: the sale of National War Bonds, and the emulation between various towns, which produced results frequently largely in excess of anticipation, suggests the possibility of introducing a similar spirit of emulation between various ship-building centres in Great Britain and Ireland. Publication&apos;of the results attained, which gave the actual outturn per man per month, would be calculated to stimulate the interest of the workers themselves, and would appeal to that sense of competition which has always been highly developed in the working class.The success of the war aims propaganda on the Clyde also tends to encourage a hope that if the facts of the shipping situation were forcibly brought home to the workers themselves and to the employers by means of effective public speakers a ready response would be gained. The probability is that the seriousness of the position though recognised by the leaders is not at all realised, or is very insufficiently realised, by the rank and file.II. Press Comments.Japan and Russia.Foreign affairs, more particularly Japanese intervention in Siberia, attracted more than usual attention in the Labour and Socialist press.As regards more purely Russian affairs, the &quot; Herald &quot; is indignant at Sir George Buchanan&apos;s speech of the 1st March, which it regards as &quot; &quot;whitewashing the Tsar,&quot; and as having been purposely &quot; timed to coincide with the agitation for the Japanese adventure,&quot; which in another place is described as &quot; the peril from the East,&quot; and as being on a par with the Governments other efforts to destroy &quot; the great asset of the Allies in this war the moral asset.&quot; The &quot;Labour Leader &quot; admits that &quot; the submission of Russia &quot; to Germany &quot; is pathetic,&quot; but says that the Germans are simply acting on the hint given to them by Mr. Lloyd George in his speech on the 6th January, &quot; when, in the name of the Allies, he abandoned Russia to the mercy of her German conquerors.&quot; &apos; We are now allowing Japan &quot; to invade Russia to crush the Revolution.&quot;The &quot; CalTs &quot; view is rather that Japan&apos;s object is &quot; the annexation of Russian and Siberian colonial territory,&quot; and that Germany and Japan in their present policy are merely putting into practice lessons learned from Imperialist Britain. The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; combines these views, holding that while Great Britain&apos;s object is to destroy the Revolution, Japan merely intends &quot; to plunder Eastern Russia,&quot;  Similarly fearful are the &quot; Leicester Pioneer &quot; and &quot; Nation.&quot;The &quot; New Statesman &apos;&apos; is rather dubious, and while prepared to admit the possible advantages of Japan&apos;s military intervention, thinks that it is &quot; not a thing to be lightly undertaken.&quot; Even the &quot; British Citizen &quot; is not enthusiastic, though it emphasises the danger of a German invasion of Siberia.The Neiv Labour Party.There is evidence of activity in the Labour Party following the ratification oP the new constitution.The &quot; Co-operative News &quot; thinks that the executive scored a great triumph at. the London Conference. The &quot; Leicester Pioneer &quot; contains an exhortation for enthusiasm and energy, while the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; gives details of a con-ference which is-to be held for the reorganisation of trades&apos; Councils and local Labour parties.War Aims.There is a considerable amount of somewhat belated criticism of the recent War Aims Declaration by the Inter-Allied Socialists, which is, perhaps, chiefly notable for an increase in the hostility previously displayed by the more extreme papers.
The &quot;British Citizen,&quot; for example, in an article entitled &quot; The Red Inter-national turns Pink,&quot;&quot; criticises the manifesto in detail, and affirms that &quot;they are a series of pious pacifist aspirations utterly uncorrelated to the grim facts.&quot; &quot; John BuiTs &quot; opinion is that these manifestos are &quot; irritating,&quot; and advises the workers to beware of being exploited. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; is much more hostile than it was last week. &quot; No Socialist or Democrat can attempt to justify &quot; the memorandum, which is &quot; welcomed by the reactionary and Imperialist newspapers.&quot; The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; is more moderate, and, while not regarding the &quot; document &quot;as altogether admirable,&quot; thinks that the fact that it is an &quot; agreed statement is a big achievement. The &quot; Herald &quot; notes a good deal of hostile criticism, but while inclined to agree, does not apparently retire from its earlier position of support.The &quot; New Witness&quot; has a somewhat original article, in which it advises Labour that it cannot trust the leaders who are proving faint-hearted in the war against Germany not - to develop similar feelings in the coming fight against capitalism.Food.Tliis subject still continues to attract attention, although it is no longer focussed on any particular point.Increasing attention is being paid to the &quot; Consumers&apos; Council,&quot; which is referred to by the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; &quot; Justice,&quot; and &quot; Cotton Factory Times.&quot; The last named advises its members to be careful or &quot; they will be blamed for results of a policy against which they have repeatedly protested for three years.&apos;&apos;The &quot;Herald.&quot; &quot; Leicester Pioneer,&quot; and &quot; Woolwich Pioneer &quot; pay attention chiefly to Local Food Committees: the two first named are still dissatisfied with the position of Labour in regard to the matter.Other subjects which receive attention are the necessity of increased production (&quot; British Citizen &quot; and &quot; Leeds Citizen &quot;) and the danger of food going bad in cold storage (&quot; Co-operative News &quot;).Man-Poiver.The &quot;Labour Leader &quot; is of opinion that the Government has failed over its man-power negotiations, while the &quot; Herald &quot; thinks that the Prime Minister, in meeting &quot; the A.S.E. delegates in a separate conference, has departed completely from the attitude assumed by Sir Auckland Geddes.&quot; It is also fairly confident that the miners&apos; ballot will go heavily against the Government.The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; and the &quot; Woolwich Pioneer &quot; accuse the reptile press &quot; of embarking on a &quot; campaign of calumny,&quot; but the former admits that the trouble is due to the policy of splendid isolation which has been adopted by the A.S.E.  It. regards the result of the ballot as a vote against the war.Dismissal of Munition Workers.The dismissal of women munition workers which has recently taken place calls forth a good deal of hostile criticism. The &quot; Co-operative News &apos;&apos; is inclined to regard it as an example of the Government&apos;s incapacity, while the &quot; Clarion,&quot; which is disposed to be much more angry, describes it as &quot; one of those inconsiderate and callous acts which the Government periodically commits,&quot; and one which is calculated &quot; to furnish the Bolsheviks with an army of new recruits.&quot;Several papers, such as the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; &quot; Co-operative News,&quot; and &quot; Call,&quot; suggest that this event casts a reflection on the Governments power to deal with the great question of demobilisation at the end of the war.The Second Lansdowne Letter.Lord Lansdowne&apos;s second letter to the &quot;Daily Telegraph,&quot; though welcomed exuberantly by the radical &quot; Nation &quot; and &quot; Common Sense,&quot; has so far attracted but little attention in the Labour and Socialist papers. The &quot;Herald,&quot; however, which supports the proposal for a Lansdowne, Asquith, Henderson Government^ describes it as &quot;a ray of light at the darkest moment in the whole history of the war.&quot;
III. District Reports.London and South-E astern.The situation in this district remains somewhat unsettled. This seems to be mainly due to wages questions, regarding which several applications have been put forward. From Woolwch it is again reported that the 1\ per cent, for piece-workers is causing dissatisfaction among the day workers, who say that this increase is on an average higher than the 12\ per cent, to day workers; the skilled day worker complains accordingly that he is now worse off in comparison.Regarding man-power the situation appears on the whole to be satisfactory, though the A.S.E. are still discussing the letter addressed to them by the Prime Minister, which seems to have met with a somewhat doubtful reception. At Messrs. Cubitfs, however, several members of the society who have been called up have gone without making any difficulty.A strike of coal porters at Tilbury Docks was threatened on the 5th owing to the shortage of meat; this, however, was subsequently averted, and taken on the whole the food situation no longer gives cause for anxiety.South-Western.The situation in this district is quiet outwardly, though the Chief Investigation Officer of the Ministry of Munitions thinks that the men, and the younger particularly, are still very restless. The discontent, owing to the shortage of food, which was pre-viously reoorted is stated to have been allayed by the prospect of an early extension of the national rationing scheme.West Midlands.Few reports have been received from this area, and the situation is stated to be fairly normal. The agitation as regards the food question seems, so far as Birming-ham is concerned, to have subsided, though at Coventry and Wolverhampton there is still cause for concern.The Workers&apos; Union at Coventry, an active and somewhat extreme body, are interesting themselves in a case before the Munitions Tribunal with regard to a man named Turner, who is claiming compensation for alleged wrongful dismissal. The men&apos;s representative, who is a member of the Workers&apos; Union, has recently com-plained of the partiality shown by the Tribunal to the employers, and the matter is to be brought before the union.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Increased unrest is reported in this district, though the situation is not serious.It is stated that in the Derby area the man-power question is strongly opposed by the engineers, particularly at the Rolls-Royce Works, where trouble is likely to occur in the future. This branch of the A.S.E. have also decided, pending instruc-tions from the Executive Council, that members shall refuse to submit themselves for medical examination, a course of action which has apparently been adopted by the Norwich engineers. At Sheffield, however, the position appears to be more satisfac-tory, and the A.S.E., realising that public feeling is against them, are said to be displaying a much more tractable disposition. The shop stewards of other societies in Sheffield hold that the attitude of the A.S.E. is against the solidarity of the trade union movement. This improvement is thought locally to be due to the turn of events in Russia.A notable point as regards the Shop Stewards&apos; Conference at Sheffield, which opened, on the 9th, was the absence of delegates from London and Glasgow, and the general view expressed was that they were ashamed to appear, after making so much noise with so little result. Strong protests were entered against the dismissal of J T. Murphy from the Vulcan Motor Works at Southport, where he has recently been employed (see Section IV), and it is possible that feeling on this score may run so high as to lead to strikes in various parts. The Conference subsequently demanded a referendum of all workers, including soldiers and sailors in Great Britain and abroad, on the question of an armistice and a Workers&apos; International [1100-20] . C
Conference. The existing Government was denounced as undemocratic, and a demand put forward for an immediate General Election. A programme for Labour members on peace questions was also agreed to; in this a policy of no annexations and the right of every nation to political independence was outlined.The opinion is, however, expressed that the delegates have not sufficient influence to carry through these resolutions, since the official trade union attitude has not grown more sympathetic. This Conference, in fact, has attracted much less atten-tion than most of those held during the past year, and may perhaps be taken as marking the loss of prestige which the shop steward movement has suffered during the past two months.Dissatisfaction with the present Government is also expressed from Leeds, where the local Labour Party have passed a resolution demanding the withdrawal of all Labour members from the Government.The General Union of Textile Workers are making a demand for an increase in wages to all their members, and to support this claim they are producing a list of firms who subscribed to the Bradford Tank.North-Western.The general position in this area is regarded as having improved, though there is still unrest in some parts, more particularly as regards the dismissal of .T. T. Murphy from the Vulcan Works at Southport.The shop stewards&apos; meeting at Barrow on the 10th passed a resolution demand-ing his immediate reinstatement, failing which they determined to lay the whole matter before their members.Discontent is also evident among the cotton workers in Manchester, who claim that at some firms an agreement whereby a 5 per cent, allowance was granted to male cardroom operatives, in return for their assistance in establishing a svstem of aDDren-ticeship, is not being observed. The intervention of the Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation is thought likely to settle the trouble.The Manchester Corporation employees are demanding a decrease in hours of work, and in this have obtained the support of the Engineering Shop Stewards&apos; Com-inittee.Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., addressed an important meeting of the N.U.R. at Liverpool on Sunday last. In spite of the extremist nature of the gathering, Mr Thomas was well received, and his extremely able speech is stated to have had avery considerable effect on his hearers.Northern.No reports of serious unrest have been received from this district, and the situation appears to be quiet.An important local cause of discontent has arisen in the closing of public-houses, which are said to be very seldom open on Saturdays and Sundays. In consequence of this many men wander about the streets, and should they find a public-house open there is much jostling and confusion, with consequent irritation and bad blood.As regards man-power no active discontent is evident, but a number of young engineers at the Elswick Works who received papers calling them up for medical examination were instructed by the shop stewards to mark them &quot; Exemption.&quot; It lias also been decided to down tools if any of these men are taken before a decision is arrived at between the A.S.E. and the Government.Miners from the Durham fields who have recently been put to work in the ship-yards are reported to be carrying out their tasks very successfully.Although some improvement was last week reported in the food situation in this area, the shortage of foodstuffs on the Tyne appears still to be somewhat serious.South Wales.The situation in this district continues to be fairly normal. There is, however, a movement among the colliery hauliers to secure a minimum wage throughout the coalfields. At Blaerhondda a meeting was held at which the hauliers were urged to press this grievance and to circulate a manifesto in order to force the Executive to attend to this demand. In the event of failure a speaker urged the men to take action to paralyse the coalfield before demobilisation took place.
Scotland.No serious unrest is reported in this area, and the Ministry of Munitions reports that the general industrial&apos;situation presents no immediate signs of disquiet.Some discontent at delays in the issue of arbitration awards has, however, been reported, and much attention is still given to the closing of public-houses.The Clyde Workers&apos; Committee and Industrial Workers of Great Britain, which have suffered in prestige over the- recent man-power affair, are being re-: organised and strenuous efforts are being made to increase their membership. An attempt is again being made to unite the two bodies, but feeling between them is not very friendly.IV. Disputes. (a.) Involving a stoppage of work.The number of disputes reported this week is greater than last week, but the situation is still quiet, and in most cases where stoppages of work have been reported the number of men affected has not been serious.The Shipyard Labour Department reports six new cases of stoppage of work, involving about 500 men only, and nineteen old cases as having been in progress during the week. In ail but one of these cases work has already been resumed, and none of the new stoppages were of great importance.The strike of joiners at Messrs. Denny Bros., Dumbarton, the only outstanding ease, still continues. After a conference at the Ministry of Labour, the union officials refused to instruct their men to return to work, and the men are now apparently applying for situations elsewhere. The strike of joiners at Messrs. Harland and Wolffs, and. Messrs. Workman, Clark&apos;s, Belfast, which involved some &quot;2,000 men, came to an end on Monday last. At a mass meeting on the 8th the men determined1 to return to work pending the consideration of their case, upon which a decision has been promised within twenty-one days. This case was dealt with by the Ministry of Labour and shipyard labour officials.Work has also been resumed at Messrs. Armstrong, Whitworth&apos;s, where 1,200 platers were involved, pending a conference between the firm and the Boilermakers&apos; Society.The Ministry of Munitions reports that 5,684 workpeople were involved in strikes during the week ending the 6th March, the most important of which occurred in the London district.At the Vulcan Motor Works, Southport, there is a serious strike involving more than 1,000 men, owing to the dismissal of J. T. Murphy, the well-known Sheffield shop steward, who had recently started work there. The reason given for his dismissal was bad time-keeping, but the men allege that others have kept equally bad time, and that Murphy was really victimised owing to his activities in organising Workshop Committees. This dispute is very unfortunate, owing to Murphy&apos;s prominence. It is thought that workers from other parts of the country may come out in sympathy if he is not reinstated, a course which has been recommended by the Ministry of Munitions.Slight unrest is again evident at Messrs. White and Poppe&apos;s, Coventry, where 118 tool-setters struck for half a day as to the interpretation of an award. The award was explained to the men on Saturday, and the dispute may be regarded as at an end.The strike of glassworkers at G-ateshead still continues, but the firm are maintaining essential output.    About 500 are involved.About 400 skilled and unskilled workers are involved in a strike which began on the 9th at the Glasgow National Projectile Factory owing to the dismissal of a man for using obscene language.A strike involving more than 700 men and women has occurred at the Doncaster Wire Works owing to the introduction of piece work. As a result of various conferences held jointly by the Ministry of Munitions and Shipyard Labour Department, the strikers have been persuaded to resume work pending arbitration.A strike of 700 aircraft woodworkers is reported from Leeds. The demand is for the application of the national aircraft award, which involves retrospective payment of a 5s. advance and the 12-1 Per cent, bonus. The hearing of the case by the Committee cn Pro-duct-ion has, unfortunately, been delayed, and the men accordingly came out on the 8th. Considerable unrest has apparently prevailed among the woodworkers for some time, as they feel that labour has a right to a larger share in the present trade prosperity.The War Office- Contracts Department has no new c.&quot;ses of stoppage of work to report this week.   Two cases, previously reported, have, however, been settled.The Coal Controller reports four new cases of stoppage of work, but in each of these cases work has already been resumed. Two stoppages, which were previously reported, are still, however, unsettled; one of these is at the Monkland Colliery, Lanarkshire, and in this case the Coal Controller has advised reference to the &quot; Lanarkshire Strikes Committee.&quot; In the second stoppage, that at the Bedlay Colliery, also in Lanarkshire, the arbitration proceedings have not yet been resumed.
^b.) Not involving a stoppage of work.The Shipyard Labour Department have thirty new and 135 old controversial cases to report; during the week a settlement has been reached in thirty-three cases. The number of cases reported in the Glasgow area is again larger than in any other.At Messrs. Scott&apos;s, Glasgow, a dispute has arisen owing to the employment of non-union labour, and as the firm refuse to dismiss the man about whom the dispute has arisen, the - workers have handed in notices to leave work on the 11th.     Should a strike take place urgent Government work will be delayed.Much unrest has recently been displayed at Avonmouth by men imported from other districts to work in the ship-repairing yards, and a number have threatened to return to South Wales unless they are provided with emergency food cards. Arrangements have now been made whereby the men are enabled to receive their emergency cards without coming to Bristol.There appears to be some danger of the electricians who were recently on strike in the Clyde area coming out again, as they have refused to submit their dispute a point arising out of 12^ per cent. to arbitration.The Ministry of Munitions reports only two controversial cases.In the one case the wheelwrights in Liverpool have claimed an advance of 10s. a week and a reduction of hours from 49^ to 46^ per week. A considerable increase hi wages and reduction in hours has previously been granted, and the Employers&apos; Association have declined to accede to this fresh demand, but have offered to meet a deputation of the men. A stoppage is threatened unless the demand is conceded.The second dispute has occurred at the Belsize Motor Co. &apos;s Works, Manchester, where a reduction in contracts necessitated a rearrangement in the working hours. The suggestion of the firm was at first agreed to by the employees; but subsequently, upon finding that it was a contravention of the women&apos;s wages orders, the men gave notice to cease work.Certain electricians in the employment of the London North Metropolitan Power Com-pany are threatening trouble over a point arising out of the 12f per cent, award, and moulders at Messrs. Lincoln, Harrison&quot;s have handed in notices owing to the refusal of certain men to join the union.The Coal Controller has two new cases of dispute to report and nine to which reference has previously been made. Only one dispute has been settled during the week.A demand for increased rates for all surface workers in the county has been put forward by the Nottinghamshire Miners&apos; Association, and the National Union of Surface Workers is asking for a general advance of 25 per cent, and an eight-hour day for all colliery workers.The War Office Contracts Department has two new controversial cases to report.The tanners in Bristol have made an application for an advance of 5s. per week and for the conversion of the 15s. bonus, which they already have, into wages. A general demand for an increase has also been made by the women chainmakers in the Midlands, who are awaiting the result of an application from the men before making a more detailed demand.The Chief Industrial Commissioner has had reports of about 212 differences during the week, eighty-two of which are claims for the 12^ per cent, bonus. Seventy-one of these cases belong to the engineering group.The most important of these cases arose out of the demand of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation for an advance of 20s. per week on pre-war rates, failing which a stoppage of work was threatened. This case was, after protracted conferences held at the Ministry of Labour, referred to arbitration before the Committee on Production, and an award issued which conceded the men&apos;s claim.A deputation from the Tyne Building Trade Conciliation Board interviewed the C.I.C. on the 8th. It was pointed out that work was being delayed and unrest aroused by the competition for labour by Government Departments. &quot; To settle this difficulty, it was finally agreed that district conditions and building trade rules should be strictly adhered to.The Committee on Production have refused a demand for a general advance of wages in the engineering and foundry trades.D.
