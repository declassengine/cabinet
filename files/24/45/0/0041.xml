(This Document Is the Property ofnt.)col!FOREIGN OFFICE.March 15th,. 1918cI circulate to the War Cabinet a memorandum which has been prepared in the Foreign Office on the subject of accommodation?Robert Cocil,
When war broke out the clerical staff of the Foreign Office numbered about 130*     In the course of the last three and a half years it has grown to over 500, apart from the subsidiary departments which have been created from time to tirr-e and have found acccmmo-dation elsewhere.    Means have hith:rto been found to house nearly the whole of this large body within the Foreign Office building, because the sacrifice of ef-ficisncy entailed by the overcrowding and understaff-ing which the process involved was less than that which would have been entailed by a dispersal of the staff.     The worst feature of the overcrowding is that officials in very responsible positions have to work in large rooms full of people where noise and inter-ruptions are inevitable;   in one room, there are over 3C occupants including heads of important sections who are called upon to initiate policy on large ques-tions, as ,i,ell as shorthand-typists (&quot;1th their machines) and persons engaged on more routine ^0rk: the worst feature of the understateing is that the rrere routine -ork of the registries suffers from the impossibility of proper sub-division*     Even these arrangements have been rendered possible only by using every part of the building, ho-ever incenven-ient, by building temporary additional rooms wherever it could be done, and by removing the Passport Office,, at the cost of great inconvenience, to a building in Victoria Street,     Practically every waiting room, has had to he given up and utilised for accommodating staff.     Foreign diplomats and other distinguishedvisitors
visitors are perforce - compcll ed to stand about tine passages, and the Flail and corridors are encumbered with presses and packing cases^For more than a year the absolute necessity of throwjing the Foreign Office and Colonial Office into one has been constantly urged, and at on: moment the Office of eforks had prepared a scheme by which this could have been effected.    Objections were, however, raised at the last moment and even the temporary expedient of further building was vetoed,A point has now been reached when progressive efficiency in the registration machinery which is out of date has had to he arrested, and when the further reorganisation and development of the Office which ha become necessary can only he continued after either the acquisition of further space or the removal of some departments of the Office to quarters elsewhere, regardless cf convenience and efficiency.    Arrange-ments are even now being made for the removal to other premises of the Prisoners of v/ar Department which, though technically not a Department of th4 Foreign Office, is staffed with Foreign Office offi-cials and is in constant coinrunicaticn with Dopart-ments of the Foreign Office.    When these arrange-ments are complete it will he possible, with the ut-most inconvenience, to re-allocate the rooms so as to give a moment&apos;s breathing space.    One further call for a single room, and the whole arrangement will collapsejfairing the last year a new department has been called into existence, the work of which requiresconstant
constant corrmuni-eation and co-operation with the Foreign Of icc*    This is the department of Overseas Trade, which, although it is also a dopartm-.nt of tho Board of Trad-., Is, as regards much of its work, an integral part of ths Foreign Office- organisation; the Under Secretary who presides over it being also in charge of two departments in the Foreign Officer At present, the department of Overseas Trade is house in various rooms scattered over a large building in Basinghall Street and the intolerable character of this arrangement will be realised from the more fact that the ordinary daily work of two important depart-ments of the Foreign Office is under the superintend-ence of an Under Secretary whose room is two rriles off, and that small questions which could be settled by a few minutes conversation between two or three members of the same Office must either be doalt with by correspondence or by a double journey between Weotminster end the Oity*     Close proximity between th&apos; now Department and the Be-erd of Trade is also a vital necessity.    The present arrangement renders im possible any real co-operation between the political and commercial sides of the Foreign Office,It must be remembered that what has to be pro-vided for is not en ephemeral department which will disappear after the war, but a permamont Department which will necessarily play a very import.oat end ever increasing part in the direction of foreign policy both before end after the end of the war8The establishment of the Overseas Trade Depart-ment under the same roof as thi Foreign Office istherefore
therefore very much more than a mere matter of of-ficial convenience;   it is a matter of imperial im-portance *It is clear that the only solution of the ques-tion which has any practical value is the expansion of the Foreign Office into the premises now occupied either by the Colonial Office or the India Office, This alone would bring the Department of Overseas Trade into close co-operation with the rest of the Foreign Office and this alone would make possible the development of the Foreign Office generally,.It is not unfortunately a question of tiding over until the end of the war.-    The work of the Foreign Office, which has more than quintupled since the outbreak of hostilities, is not likely to dimin-ish for many years after the conclusion of peace; it may even increase*    The number of papers received in the Foreign Office in 1913 amounted to 58,790, while in 1917 it reached the total of 246,158,    Dur-ing the years immediately following the war, and still more during the critical period c.f peace negoti tions - when there will be a continuous demand for prompt and co-ordinated information on a large varioty of subjects - it would be disastrous if the work of the Foreign Office were to be seriously im-paired by the inadequate accommodation from which it has suffered for some time past, and which is now rendering further reorganisation and preparation irm-possible?Foreign Office,,March 14th, 1918,
