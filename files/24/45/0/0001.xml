His Britannic fVJajesty&apos;s Government.)(This Document is the Property of/66Department of InformationSECRETIntelligence BureauG.S.W./OlSrWEEKLY   REP.ORT   ON   SWEDEN.XII(March 13 1918)German troops have occupied most of Eekero and the Eastern and Western parishes of the main Aland Islands.     Sweden is meanwhile occupying the Northern and Southern parishes.     About 500 men of the Russian garrison appear to be willing to leave the Islands for Abo on the Finnish Mainland;   but 500 Letts, Esthonians and Poles formerly serving in the Russian army have asked to be transferred to Sweden and to this the Swedish Government ha-ve consented.     As soon as this is done the Swedish Government propose to evacuate the Islands, at the same time addressing a Note to the German Government to the effect that they have taken note of tho German assurances that the Islands will not be permanently occupied.     As the German Government have declared against the fortification of the Islands, the Swedish Government as!: that the existing defences may be at once destroyed,   under the super-vision of the Swedish and Finnish authorities,the Germans and Russians assisting if they think fit to do so.   The Swedish Government are taking steps to ascertain whether the Entente Powers offer any objection to the course they propose to take. Meanwhile the Germans have captured 800 of the Russian garrison of the Islands.The comments in the Swedish Press on the announcement that Germany intended to land troops in the Aland Islands were almost wholly confined in the Conservative newspapers to attacks on the Swedish Government for not having intervened in Finland,     This they maintained would have obviated German intervention and the consequent occupation of the Islands by that Power.     The pro-
German :!Af tonblacet &apos; dismisses the  ears .vor Sweden expressed in the Entente Press as intentionally alarmist.     The only Conservative newspaper in the capital which deals seriously with the situation is the Hya Dagligt Allehanda &apos;. It points out the significance of the paragraph   regarding the Aland Islands in the Treaty between the Centraifowers and Russia.     This clause provides that at Germany1s desire other Baltic Powers besides herself, Russia, Finland and Sweden, may be invited to participate in the settlement of the Aland Islands Question.   This, the Conservative organ maintains, shows that Germany intends to have the last word in the decision of tho fate of the Islands. It is further noted that the nationality and wishes of the Islanders are not referred to in the clause.    The &quot;Stockholm&apos;s   [ Dagblad&quot; attacks the Government for having protested against the German occupation, on the ground that that protest has no basis in International Law since the Islands do not belong to Sweden.     The Liberal and Socialist newspapers bitterly attack the Finnish Government and take up the defence of the Eden Cabinet.     They point out that the Finnish Government seem at the same time to have asked for intervention from both Sweden and Germany, indeed they perhaps asked for German assistance first.The important  &apos;Goteborg Kandels Tidning&quot; upholds the national point o;C view and deplores that this has been lost sight of in the midst of party recriminations.     It declares that the complete subservience of the Conservatives to Germany is likely to become a serious danger to Swedish nationality.     It would, it adds, be regrettable if German action in the Baltic should force patriotic Swedes to regard the failure of Germany to achieve victory as the sole salvation for their country.There is no doubt whatever that the Swedish Government and indeed all thoughtful Skyedes, who are not blinded by party warfare,
are alarmed by the very serious situation created by the German occupation of the Aland Islands, and by the presence of a powerful German squadron almost within Swedish territorial waters.     Even the slow-minded Swede realises that Germany probably intends to make a Germanised Finland the Northern wing of &quot;Middle Europe&quot; so as to cut off Western Europe from Russia.The classes which are prc-Gerrnan in Sweden are the nobility, bureaucracy and the officer-corps-.     It must be remembered that there is an extreme element,hitherto small,in Sweden which differs little, if at all, from the Anarchists in Russia, Finland and elsewhere. It is not altogether unnatural that the Conservative classes, with, recent object lessons at their very doors, regard the possible advent of Bolshevism in Sweden with growing apprehension.     They look upon Germany as representing order and a stable condition of Soci-aty. It is not only in Sweden that this has been the case from the outbreak of war.     It is a common thing to hear moderate, sensible, and by no means unfriendly Swiss, Spaniards, Scandinavians say that the Entente is deliberately encouraging the unruly elements in all countries to break out and destroy religion, order and indeed all that makes life worth living.     The normal Swede intensely dislikes disorder and confusion.     Anyone who remains a few days in Stockholm or any Swedish town must be struck with the admirable order and efficiency of everything and with the almost exaggerated politeness of even the children.     It Is clear that such a population,if uninfected, will normally regard an introduction of anarchism with unmitigated dislike.     But these are not normal times.     Sweden is badly off for food and prices are very high, Revolutionary ideas, however insane, are notoriously catching, especially among&quot;bodies Qf men like an army.     TJp to the present the Swedish army has preserved its loyalty;   but how long this .;I11 continue is an
uncertain factor.    The Bernadotte dynasty in no way appeals to the imagination and it is doubtful whether it has deep roots in the affections of the nation.     The present King is not a romantic figure nor is he a man of ability.     The crushing of Bolshevism in Finland, which after German invention has actually taken place is a mere matter of time, may imitate the advanced parties in Sweden and in the universal ferment caused by the war and the increasingly precarious food-situation may lead to a serious condition of affairs, the ultimate effects of which it is impossible to fore-see.
