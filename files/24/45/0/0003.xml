i 9 1 &amp;TXQ      YUl COMMISSION IITTERNATIOHALZ! DE RAVITillLlTIvKiIT.(Memorandum by the Minister nf Munitions.)With reference to the document G.T.-3430,in which it is proposed that the British staff of the C.I.R. should &quot;be made responsible to the Foreign Office, I do not consider that a case has been made out for the transfer, and I agree with the opinion expressed by Dr. Addison in G.2.-3749 that it is undesirable to disturb the present arrangement under which the C.I.R. is loosely attached to the Board of Trade for parliamentary and administrative purposes.which the British staff work, and if the Director can show that the situation is so unsatisfactory that a change is essential I suggest that the alternative should take the form of breaking up the staff and associating it more closely with the various Inter-ally organisations which have been set up, such as the V/heat, Sugar and Nitrate Executives, and with the American Board, the Chairman of which might take over the responsibility which Is now &quot;borne by the President of the 3o?rd of Trade.I fully appreciate the difficulties under12th March. 1918.Winston S, Churchill.
