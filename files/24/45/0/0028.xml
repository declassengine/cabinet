The infantry of the British Army has been reduced by 25$, or approximately 170 battalions.   Tno addition of 7 2 American battalions will still leave that Army substantially smaller than it was last year, and therefore well within tho compass of our cross channel transportation and railway system on the British Front.Tho immense political and military advantages of drawing American manhood into the war, and of thuspartially filling the gap caused by the diminution of our own forces, o^ght to outweigh all other considerations and make us ready to submit to the further reduction in food, civil imports and munitions rather than lose the benefit which should now bo reaohod.   It is emphatically a case where the difficulties ought to be surmounted and mastered, and not recoiled from as soon as they present themselves.   A true sense of relative values at the present time would ascign supreme priority to tho rapid augmentation by every conceivable means cf the numbers of American soldieis in France. Q,ui to/
Quite apart from the imperious military need, the intermingling of British and American units on the field of battle and their endurance of losses and suffering together may exert an immeasurable effect upon the future destiny of tho English-speaking peoples, and will afford us perhaps tho only guarantee cf safety if Germany emerges stronger frcm tho War than she entered it.(Sgd.)     WIUSOT S. CHURCHILL.14th. March, 1918.
