O-^ M - y(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic fV?ajesty&apos;s Government.)THE   FOOD SITUATION IN FRANCE.MEMORANDUM BY TEE FOOD CONTROLLER.Applications made by the French Government for additional help In tonnage and in food supplies have been based on an alleged serious shortage .. of food in the provinces, which were said to be kept short in order that Paris and the large industrial centres, where labour discontent was more to be feared, might be kept well supplied.The general impression of British visitors to France appears to be, on the contrary, that not only are there good supplies of bread hut also extraordinarily plentiful supplies of meat, butter and milk.   ELM, Ambassador in Paris was therefore requested to telegraph to H.Iv&apos;,  rs Consular Officers asking for each to telegraph his general views as to the situation in his district and to forward later a detailed report.   The telegrams were issued to the Consular Officers at Bordeaux, Brest, Havre,..Lyons, Marseilles. Nantes and Nice on January 21st and the renoorts-refer accordingly to conditions at the end of January.The reports vary greatly in the amount of detail given. Nearly all comment on the great rise in prices since the beginning of the war, but prices have also risen In this country and would have risen further but for stringent Government control,     As regards quantity of supplies available the reports confirm generally the   Impressions referred to above,A brief tabular summary of the reports Is attached (App.A). From this it will be seen that meat   is only mentioned as being in very short supply or sometines unprocurable in certain villages of the Marseilles district (Department of the Gard),   Elsewhere there Is no shortage or the supply Is positively abundant.   As regards dairy produce, no shortage of butter is anywhere reported: milk is said to
be in short supply In the town-of Bordeaux,-at Cherbourg, and in moderate supply- generally In the Havre District A but no shortage Is reported elsewhere.     Sugar is often reported as In short supply but not in every case, and H.M.Consul at Havre reports on the profusion of sweets that can be purchased - a feature which must have struck most recent visitors to Paris.     Vegetables have not been specially noted in this abstract but the supply seems to be plentiful, though dear.i&quot;The conditions as regards bread and .farinaceous foods (e.g. macaroni etc. J clearly Vary greatlyv&apos; Nantes reports nO scarcity and &quot;Pain a discretion^in the hotels and &quot;restaurants, as was also the case, till reoently at all events, in Paris.     Brest reports a good supply, though of inferior-quality:   Lyons only temporary shortages due to breakdown of transport and Marseilles (town) little shortage. On the other hand there is some scarcity in the Bordeaux district, though less in the rural districts than the towns: a short supply at Havre: a very short supply In the rural districts of Marseilles and a grave shortage at Nice, where -even the ration of 300 grammes per day (4 lb.r10 oz, per head per week) has often been unprocurable.     Conditions at Marseilles are attributed largely to the breakdown of transport which is also referred to in the reports from Lyons, Biarritz, Toulouse and elsewhere:   H.M.Consul at Nice speaks of the organisation for distribution as bad and wasteful, but it is now being taken in hand.   Rationing Of bread is at present sporadic, not universal.     No mention &quot;is made of any restriction at Brest, Lyons, Marseilles or Nantes,    &quot;The Havre district and Nice are rationed.     The town of Bordeaux was to be rationed from February 1st and La Rochelle is also mentioned in the Vice-Consulf s report r. as rationed, but &quot;the pejple living in the Department of the Glronde have only been told to try and curtail their
consumption of broad&quot;   The usual ration appears to be300 grammes per head per day as mentioned above   for Nice,The relative conditions in the towns and outlying villages appear to vary considerably. In the Bordeaux district the villages appear to be distinctly better off than the towns, and H.M. Consul at Lyons specifically states that the country districts have not suffered at the expense of the large industrial centres^ but on the contrary aro- more abundantly supplied.   In some . villages of the   Var and of the Gard on the other hand (cf. the Marseilles report) there appears to be a grave shortage of supplies, both of bread and of meat.The most remarkable feature of the reports is the almost universal abundance of meat and of dairy produce, with the sole exception of some shortage of milk in certain urban areas.   A possible explanation of this abundance - indeed It seems difficult to suggest ar^ other, having regard to the shortage of    fee ding stuffs is that grain in the hands of farmers Is being fed to stock.&apos; ffihe hypothesis Is consistent with the shortage I5f breadstuffs even In some rural districts, and reference may also be made in this connection to the remarks of HvM. Consul at Marseilles on the failure of the authorities sufficiently to use the power of requisition.   The feeding of wheat suitable for milling, or wheat flour, to stock has been prohibited since April 1916, but no prohibition seems to exist as regards any other grain,   All cereals and grain were nominally requisitioned by the Government on January 1st 1918 but deduction was permitted of quantities necessary (1) for seed; (2)   for consumption by the grower1 s household; (3) of the cereals o.t)aor than wheat required by the grower for fodderr   Before further
help Is given by H.M.Government in tonnage or In the allocation of grain supplies, the situation as regards the feeding of stock requires to be elucidated.Reference may perhaps be made in conclusion to an interview with M.Boret reported in the Matin (11.2.18) and to the comments of H.M.Ambassador thereon.   M.Boret admitted that the food situation in .Prance would appear to the casual observer in towns to be better than in other Allied countries, but alleged (ifithout, however, giving any evidence) that this appearance was fictitious and that he was as badly off as other Food Controllers, or even wortie off.     He passed severe strictures on the warmer in which the public had evaaed previous restrictions, strictures which, says H.!vV. Ambassador - &quot;bear cut the ,statements &quot;contained in my previous despatched to,the effect that &quot;all restrictive measures adopted in France are rendered &quot;to a great extent inoperative by the lax manner in which :&quot;they are administered,  and by the universal collaboration &quot;on the part of those affected to evade their stipulations.&quot; He goes on to say that the results of the enquiries made on behalf of the Ministry of Food is to confirm his previous opinion - &quot;that there is no sign in this country of any &quot;very serious want of essential foodstuffs, such as that &quot;which appears to exist in the United ICiiigdom, and that the &quot;repeated statements made by French Idinisters of Food that &quot;the situation is bad are due more to the fear that they &quot;may be required to supply foodstuffs to their Allies than &quot;to the actual necessities of the moment.     It is not &quot;improbable that the interview published in the Matin was &quot;granted by V,. Boret with the.-,  object of guarding against &quot;any requests foi* French Asisistanue in these&quot; matters by u. &quot;public statement that the food situation is bad and that &quot;the restrictions which will shortly be imposed are such
&quot;as will make it clear that Prance is entitled rather &quot;to receive than to render assistance.&quot;Summaries of the original reports are attached.(Appendix B).RHONDDA.MINISTRY OP FOOD,15th March, 19.13,

BORDEAUX DISTRICT Appendix B. -----0O0---The Consul confirms his telegraphic report to the effect that the rural population and small villages are not short of supplies other than flour and oats, and of those only to a certain extent and not so much as large cities.The facts and documents brought to his notice shew, inhis opinion, that the rural districts   are not short of foodin the strict sense of the term.   Things may not be soabundant as people would like, but country people only bringto market what they do not require and so will always bebetter off than the towns:    in spite of the local authoritieshaving requisitioned all cereals, all have placed asidesufficient for their own wants.   There is some scarcity of isflour but this/much more marked in the towns;   thus Bordeaux is to have bread cards from February 1st, but in the Department of the Gironde people have only been told to try and curtail their consumption.     Sugar is in short supply, milk only in short supply in the towns.The Consul considers that, for the moment at least, the diverting of tonnage and food to this part of France is not justified, the state of affairs in the United Kingdom being far more acute.ABSTRACT OF REPORTS FROM VICE-CONSULS,Departments of Charente and Charente Inferieure.TOHNAY-CHARENTE.   There is no real scarcity of-any articles of food, the only items, in short supply being bread and &quot;pates alimentaires&quot;.LA ROCHE LIE. There is no shortage of meat of any kind nor of milk; butter is fairly abundant&quot; and the production of cheese (goats milk) is maintained.   Green vegetables and potatoes are plentiful and dried beans, peas, and lentils-1-
La Rochelie (continued)obtainable though dear.     There Is no shortage of breadstuffs, but bread Is rationed at 300 grammes per head per day (41b. 10 oz. per week).     Groceries are short, except coffee and sugar.    There is a shortage of hay, straw, oats and barley for feeding purposes.Departments of Basses Pyrenees^ and Jkutas^ Fyroae.es.Food supplies in the rural districts are sufficient for the needs of the population,    Temporary shortages, e.g. in flour and potatoes, have been mainly due to faulty organisation.BATONS.   The markets in the small towns and rural districts are well stocked and there is no shortage of food.     Meat and fresh vegetables are abundant.     The peasants are well supplied as they only bring to market what they do not themselves require.At Bayonne itself there is a shortage of fresh milk and in one or two villages there have been shortages of bread due to neglectful organisation.PAU.     Some of the villages are undoubtedly short of wheat, maize, oats, haricets and potatoes owing to the local authorities having allowed too much to leave the Department.fteyarjmenb^cf Haute GaronneTOUI-OTJSB.    There is no dearth of food supplies, though they have doubled and trebled in price, but the working classes earn much more than in normal times and nothing in the shape of misery appears to exist.     There have, however, been difficulties in transport Of food supplies owing to shortages of eoal and petrol and the scarcity of horses and vehicles.
K.B.M, Consul at Brest reported by telegram (January 24th) that there was no real shortage in any of&quot; the necessaries of life in his district, though prices were high, in part owing to the large influx; of Americans,   There was a goocO. supply of fresh meat, cf bread of a somewhat inferior quality, of the staple vegetables and of dairy produce,Eis later report by letter confirms this general statement, as regards both the town of Brest and the outlying parts of Finistere,but practically adds nothing thereto beyond giving lists of the predominant prices.
. The Consul reports as his general impression after tours through tho district that food was pleMtfui, though dear, sugar was always purchasable by card., but bread and pastry were scarce.   People looked cheerful and there was no discontent.   The working classes have never had &quot;so much money to spend.In a motor drive to Caen through St. Romain. Lillebcnne. Quilleboeuf, Pont-Audemer, Pcnt-1 ^veque, Dozule and Troarn he everywhere saw the shops well stocked with groceries, butchers 1 shops with sides of beef and mutton hanging in quantities and greengrocers well supplied with vegetables.    In Caen there Y^as even greater profusion, and food was cheaper than at Havre, There was no difficulty in obtaining any quantity with the exception of bread and pastry, and sugar - though sweets were freely sold in the shops.   At Trouville and Honfleur, visited on the return journey, conditions were precisely similar.On a journey taken a few days later to Dieppe and  report, passing through Montivilliers, Goderville, Fecamp, Cany, St.Val-erry-en-Caux, the same well stocked shops were observed, though not so mush meat as in the Department of Calvados,   The Vice-Consul at Treport reported in the same general terms4Cherbourg was not visited, but the Vice-Consul reported that there was no real shortage except as regards bread and milk.   The shortage of the latter is said to be due to tho number of cows killed three years ago and the consequent reduction of the dairy he/butter
butter Is; however, speoifioally said to be plentiful. Meat and &quot;vegetables are also easy to obtain, though the latter are expensive, owing to the shortage of labour and difficulties of transport,   Imported groceries, such as dried peas and beans,, cost far mere than before the war but are still to be had, as are also such luxury-articles as raisins,Tho Consul comments on the fact that the dinner obtained for 5 fros. at the   hotel at Caen would be considered extravagant in England,   At Dieppe he lunched at   his pension with a friend, who assured him that it was the every-day fare,   &quot;If the amount were cut down by half it would still be envied by London clubmen at the present moment&quot;
Though the price of food is at least double that of normal times there is no serious shortage in any part of the Consular district.   Everywhere food is&apos; apparently much more plentiful than in England.The country districts have not suffered atthe expense of the large industrial centres, but on thecontrary are        more abundantly supplied.     During snowstorms in January some villages were cut off fromsupplies for a few days, but were less   unfortunate inthis &apos;respect than the industrial towns of the Departmenta-of the Loire where the snowstorms caused^sericus, though temporary, shortage of flour.     Lyons suffered for a few days from the same cause, and has from time to time experienced a relative food shortage owing solely to difficulties of transport and lack of proper organisation.Generally speaking food, though dear,  is very plentiful in Lyons, more so than in Paris, and certainly more so than in England.   There continues to be much wanton waste and extravagance.   The population as a whole have no conception of the shortage existing in certain other countries, the district being almost self-supporting with the exeeption of the thinly populated Department of the Creuse.
MARSEILLES DISTRICT ---)------0O0--------There appears to be no absolute lack of food products at the present time in the Marseilles district, but the villages and outlying districts are suffering from a shortage of bread and sugar with occasional and temporary shortages of. other foods.      At Marseilles Itself there is very little absolute shortage although difficulties in the procuring of food are considerable.In certain villages Of. the Var there appears to be little or no bread on three days in the week and in some villages of the Gard meat is not procurable at all one or two days a.week and gangs of workmen occasionally . refuse to work owing to the lack of food.     The workmen get good wages and would be able to purchase if food supplies were in existence on the spot.The Consul states that the Information at his disposal leads him to believe that these conditions are mainly due: to the more or less general breakdown of transport facilities, to which Government priority in regard to railway transport has contributed;   the inability of peasants and farmers to grow wheat- at g profit, at the fixed price, owing to the high price of the oilcake    , . (castor and rape cake) generally used for manure,   to speculation in food, and to lack tof tonnage for Imports.The transport question is dealt with at considerable length in his report.     Railway trucks are Insufficient and construction and repair work has not   been sufficiently accelerated to replace those required for transport of war material.     There is also a lack of locomotives. The trucks required since the opening of the Italian campaign, those placed &amp;i the disposal of the American.
troops, and the trucks loaded with munitions and food and held in reserve by the military authorities are said to have added to the embarrassment of the railroads.    There are large stocks on the Marseilles quays and in the warehouses for which transport cannot be procured.As regards speculation, it is said that   this has- bee: facilitated by the lack of transport and apparently by the authorities failing sufficiently to use the power ofrequlsitiwiii     This power is now, however, to be appliedtheby/Prefectures of the various Departments, in whom the distribution of supplies is to be centralised.     In the Bcuches du Rhone, the Regisseur du Service de Ravitaillement Civil is the officer responsible for the administration of this measure and he has stated that the right to requisition will be used freely by him in order to keep the outlying towns and villages properly supplied,. This administration possesses prior rights with regard to railway transportation,These new arrangementb, it is hoped by the Consul, will lead to oonciderable amelioration of existing conditions as his enquiries lead him to believe there, is no momentary shortage.The future; however, gives cause for anxiety having regard to the insufficiency of tonnage for importation and the poor crop prospects owing to the high prices of manures .
iThe Consul reports that there is no real shortage of foodstuffs.     Although $antes Is threatened with the breadrcard system there seems to be no scarcity of bread and at the restaurants there is still &quot;pain t discretion&quot;.All the shops seem well stocked with provisions and there are no queues.     Prices are rising, but this is true for all kinds of goods. The Consul has heard no complaints of people being unable to procure the necessaries of life.
NICE.Many things are becoming difficult to obtain except at high prices but there is not at present any serious shortage except in the case of bread, flour and farinaceous foods, such as macaroni,The organisation for the distribution of bread has been bad and wasteful but is now being taken in hand.     The nominal allowance is 300 grammes per head per day (4 lb, 10 cz, per week) but less is often cbtainable, and the quality is bad.
