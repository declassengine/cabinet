1 c3JL d^^mm^ POSITION OF T03A0C0 STOOJSAWc-*H JKXS COOBSK.^\ Witli reference to the attached ^^Memcrandim by the iQhainaan of the Tobacco and Matches Control Board, I should be glad if. the questions raised could be taken into early consideration by the War Cabinet in order that a decision may be given as soon as possible.    The matter is one of some urgency.Board of Trade.- both March, 1913,
Present Position of TobaccoStocks in this Country,Itwill be remembered that on November 16th, 1917,the Board, in view of the depleted condition of Tobacco stocks in this country and the entirely inadequate amount of imports, put forward a proposal that unless sufficient imports could be guaranteed it was absolutely necessary to restrict the civilian consumption of Tobacco to a moderate degree, otherwise they felt.it was inevitable that in the near future a point would be reached when a drastic cut would be rendered imperative by the shortage of stocks in this country.&quot;in their opinion, and in the opinion of the trade, the reduction of the stocks in the country to a point v&amp;ere there would be less than six months&apos; supply would bring about a critical position in the trade.    This is owing to the fact that the manufactured Tobacco is composed of so many different grades, and further that it takes from four to six months for Tobacco to peas from the farmer to the *   consumer *The &quot;?ar Cabinet however decided that the consumption of Tobacco, was to remain on the same level as during the year 191?, and the Shipping Controller was authorised to provide the necessary tonnage.tons arrived, in this country, and the utmost concession that the i-hipping;Controller has been able to make is that he will allocate shipping space per month for 3,000 tons, and even that could not be absolutely counted upon.She position to-day owing to the smallness of ira-ports is naturally considerably more critical than it was atThe Board would call attention to the fact thatDuring the first... two months of this year only 3,500(i)the
the end of 1917, and the board feel that unless adequate imports of tobacco can be guaranteed it must be at once decided to make a cut in the civilian consumption.the stocks of tobacco at the end of february were 53,500 tons, which is slightly over % months1 supply.   the consumption to-day is 6,650 tons per month, or 80,000 tons per annum, and while there is no sign of any diminution in the civilian consumption^ experience shows that the requirements by sis majesty^ forces are continually on the increase.it will appear that there has been an enormous increase in the consumption of tobacoo since the beginning of the war. in 1913, which was the last full peace year, duty was paid on 43,000 tons, and in sddition there was an export trade of 14,700, making 57,700 tons in all.the additional constunption since is primarily due to the constantly increasing demands of his majesty&apos;s forces abroad, as the following table will show:-1914 1915 1916 1917home consumption.tens. 45,000export trade including h.m. foroes abroad. tons.total. tons.-   15,500 60,50046,500 30,000 76,500.49,000 32,000 81,00045,000 34,000 79,000as regards home consumption, in view of the fact that so many civilians have been transferred to various branches of h. m. forces, a corresponding reduction in the amount consumed would appea to have resulted, bat as a matter of fact there has been a slight increase under this head.   to account for this it must be recsabered that there is no doubt army life tends to increase consumption, and that not only are the demands of our troops at home included in the amount of tobacco on which duty is paid, but also those of our troops from the dominions overseas and the belgians in this country.    there is also no doubt that working men, and in fsct all civilians, are smoking considerably more than(in
in pre-war times and that smoking by women is becoming more general every day.In the original proposal of the Board it was hoped that the Garland Line would bring in 15,000 tons on their two ships, the &quot;Horlina&quot; and the &quot;Alamanco&quot;, but the &quot;Alamance&quot; has been torpedoed, and the &quot;Norlina&quot; has been requisitioned by the American Government.    Urgent repre-sentations are being mado by His Majesty&apos;s Government to tho American Government to release two ships of the Garland Line to replace these, but if this is not successful it is obvious ihat these estimated imports will not be available.The Board are of opinion that unless tonnage can be arranged so that about 6,000 tons per month will arrive in this country, the following course should be adopted:-(1) That the civilian consumption should be reduced by 25/  from the 1917 consumption, commencing on April 1st, rising to a reduction of 33-l/3rd$ on 1917*consumption on July 1st unless the position should have improved.(2) That His Majesty&apos;s Forces at home should be subject to the same restrictions of smppjj as the civilian population.(3) That the amount of Tobaooo supplied to the Royal Havy and His Majestyfs Military Forces overseas should be restricted through the various sources of supply to an amount nQt exceeding the actual  mount supplied through any particular souree in 1917.    This would prevent any in-crease under this heading.If this course should be adopted:-(l) The absolute minimum amount of shipping to ensure six months1 supply at the reduced rate of consumption would from 1st March be reduced from 5,610 tons a month, to approximately 3,300 tons a month, and the whole con-sumption during the ten months, March to December 1918, would be reduced from 68,500 tons to 54,965 tons.
(2) 31,544 tons would bo in stock on December 31st, 1918, or six months1 supply at the reduced rate of con-sumption (at the present rate of consumption six months&apos; Stock would amount to 41,100 tons).In arriving at a decision in this mattor it should be borne in mind that in the opinion of the Board a card or rationing system for Tobacco is a practical impossi-bility, mainly owing to the impossibility of dividing the population into smokers and non-smokers.    Consequent-ly the only practical method of reducing the consumption is to reduce the supplies from the Manufacturers to the Whole-sale rst and from the Wholesalers to the Retailers, pro rata to their 1917 supplies, and this would undoubtedly for a time bring about a oertain inequality of distribu-tion.With these facts in mind, and in view of other gen-sral considerations, the Board would strongly urge that if it be at all possible the necessary amount of shipping to prevent a restriction to the civilian population should be forthcoming.    Alternatively, they are of opinion that the restrictions, on the lines they have laid down, are the smallest possible consistent with any substantial economy in tonnage, and that they should be authorised in the immediate future, arch 19th, 1918. &apos;      LANCELOT HUGH SMITH.TOOTH:-  Since the above was written the Shipping Con-troller has notified the President of the Board of Trade that he has provisionally allotted 6,000 tons for April. The Tobacco Control Board feel most strongly that unless this amount can bo imported month by month their proposed ::^striction should be authorised forthwith.
