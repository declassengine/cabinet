T.3932,WAR   CABINET.THE ARMY AND &amp;AI30SS&apos; TOL&amp;RgSS IN FRANCE.Memorandum^ the. Secretary of[ State for V/ar.12l/prance/l488,A difficult situation has arisen.   On several pceaeioho recently in the House of Commons, the question of Mai sons Tolerees in Prance has arisen.   The Under Secretary of State maintained what has been the accepted view of the Military Authorities and of the Governments since the beginning of this war,   This view was also definitely asserted by the present Prime Ministeifwhen he was Secretary of State for war, in a letter of the 8th August, 1916. It wa3 addressed to the Right Honourable T,R* Ferens, M.P., one of the most respected leaders of iQassnoonformist thought in this country.   In this letter he said &quot;It must be remembered that the system of licensed houses is officially recognised by the French Government and whatever may be our views on the matter, it is not possible or indeed   prudent, to overlook this fact.   Were all licensed houses to be put out of bounds, it is clear that the chances of contamination would be greatly increased.   There is, however, no question of official sanction or control by the military or of a system of queues.   The licensed houses are mainly at Base Ports where the temptations are most obvious and the risks greatest. Much can be done by example and precept, but human nature being what it is , it is incumbent on us to protect from themselves those who would not respond to such an appeal.   The problem is with us here, and on the whole I think it would be unwise to take so drastic a step as you suggest&quot;.These licensed houses are established by the French Government and are in no way under our control.   They are part and parcel of the life of the country,  and we can do nothing to disestablish them or close them,, \4The Military Authorities hava always regarded it as wise and prudent not to interfere with these institutions and so offend the susceptibilities of our Allies.   Th^-could only properly interfere if our soldiers in a town occupied by us created disorder in the institution in that town, and then any interference on the part of pur A.P.M. would have to be delicately done.1 :(Quite&quot;&apos; recently there has been a great outburst of public indignation on this matter, and daily and hourly both myself and the Under Secretary of State receive indignant resolutions from individuals and from Associations all over the country.   These resolutions show that a very large number of the people of the country resent with passionate indignation what they regard as our approval of, or connivance at, institutions which are alien to the tradit ions of this country.   *:y opinion is that unless we take some steps, the outburst of indignation will oontinue t^o increaso and might have a far reaching affect upon the good-will of a most respectable part of the community towards the Government and the National cause.
The tfiider Secretary of State has to reply to definite questions as to our attitude in the,&quot;House of Commons on Tuesday, aM it ia, therefore, necessary to oonsi der- what our attitude should &quot;be on the matter...There are three views which might be considered:&quot;(1)       Should Wjh placfc   the&quot;se institutions out of bounds for our Troops?With regard to this, it was hitherto thought that an action of this sort might offend the susceptibilities of our Allies, but I am assured that both the French .prime Minister and 1-1, Piohon have s$4&amp; to*day that any such action on our part would have no such effect, and that they were quite willing to eonseht to our exercising our Judgment in any way we ploosed.   On the other hand, the Military Authorities say that it we adopted this action, it would mean, yirstj the detailing of many men in a police capacity to carry out any such order, and Secondly, they feel that placing thes^institutions out of bounds would increase to a great extent the venereal diseases in the Army.   As against this latter view, men like lord Sydenhaa^ who was Chairman of the Royal Commission on Venereal Diseases, ho3.d the view very strongly that the regulated house is no security, and particularly so at the present time when medical authorities have not the time to inspect them $ally and hourly &amp;b they should do to prevent contamination.(2)      The second view is that we should place out of bounds those institutions in any locality where the Prench civil population should protest.   As to this view,  although it has been said that at one particular place, the French civil population did protest, it is doubtful whether when an institution is planted there by the civil authorities, the civil population would take it upon themselves to enter any such protest.(3)      The third Yim is that we should continue as at present and maintain that view without flinching.A.8 I said , ther g/would be a storm of indignation, and we should have to giv^^^ facts for ani against.   The question could not then remain a purely military one.   It would become a National ona and ths unsavoury and Maiodorous discussion of the subject on the merits would have to be carried on by myself or by the Under Secretary of State, v?ith the full concurrence and support of the War Cabinet.(3d.) DERBY.15th March, 1918,
