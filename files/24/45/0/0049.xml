I5bh March,1916,^ LABOUR  FOP.  K3RCH4KT   SHIPBUILDING, ^^j^r^^^amiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet.On the 82nd January 1918 (War Cabinet 328 MinuteNo. 19 of that date on Man-Power:   Supply of Labour inShipyardg) it was decided that,&quot;The 20,000 men for Shipbuilding now asked for should be released from the Forces at Hone and Over &quot;seas, from all categories, but excluding Officers and warrant Officers&quot;.2.-- On the 12th March, the position with regard tothe discharge of these men was as followsArrivals at     Despatched to       Remaining in Ripon. Shipyards. Camp awaitingdischarge.1,888 1,098 7903.-    At the present moment the men are being selected from the Cards at Kew from the Home Forces at the rate of 250 per day.   The Army Council have laid it down that men must be taken in the following order (a) low categories fir (b)   all the shipyard worker? must be taken from the Home Forces before a start is made with discharging men from the t   les overseas,4.-    The supply of a sufficient number of skilled men ia the first essential for the output and repair of ships, and in order to get an immediate improvement it ia essential that every skilled shipyard worker should be got into the yards and workshops at the earliest possible moment, 5.-    The Army Council intend to satisfy the demands out of the Home Forces before the Expeditionary force is touched This arrangement will not be satisfactory for three reasons
1.   The number of skilled workers in the Home Army is not sufficient to increase shipbuilding as required.8.   After the skilled workers in home Array are securedthere will be delay in beginning the supply from Overseas. The whole process will be too protracted.3.   Obtaining the men out of the Home Army only will not satisfy either employers or the trades unions and until all the shipyard workers in the army are released for shipbuilding,, ailutions upgrading, introduction of un-skilled labour or the extension of labour saving appliances will meet with continued opposition.It :&apos;- therefore recommended that the War Cabinet should givefollowing order:-That the number of shipyard workers to be released from the army is not limited to 80.000 and all  shipyard workers in the army should be released as quickly as possible from the. forces both at home and overseas, of all categories but excluding Officers and Warrant Officers.That Shipyard Managers and &apos; Assistant Managers,and Engineers who are Officers in the Army should be released on individual application of the Admiralty as quickly as possible.That the release of men from the Home Forces and from the Expeditionary Forces should go on concurrently and every means should be used to expedite such releases.That when the Admiralty is able to supply the names of Shipyard Workers on leave from the Expeditionary Forces the return of such men to the Expeditionary Force should &apos; be immediately stopped and the men ordered to report at a discharging centre.(Sgd)    ERIC GEDBES.
