(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Malesty&apos;s Government.)g^CVABlA?J^v       CIVILIAN AND ABM RATIONS.Mm*^p.IORANDTJM BY POOD CONTROLLER.KitSir Alfred Mond, in his note of March 1st, makes some criticisms on the flat rate of meat rat-ions-adopted in the London and Home Counties Rationing Scheme and some-migge-sl&amp;ons...&quot; as to Army Rations and reserve c*f meat.   With the latter I cordially agree.   Tho former, I think, are founded cn a mis apprehens i on.Tha uniform meat ration for all adults irrespective cf occupation was adopted after the fullest possible consideration of expert advice.   The introduction of a flate rate was specifi-cally recommended in a report of the Food Control Committee of the Royal Society.   There is no reason why a heavy worker should have more &quot;butcher1 s meat than anyone else.   YJhat he Y/ants is fat and bread t* give him energy for his work.   It is of little importance to him to have a greater amount of protein than the sedentary worker.2 need not dwell upon this point however,   I am already arranging to provide for the needs of heavy workers by an additional   ration of bacon, which though classed as meat is really ftr dietetic purposes much more akin to   fat. &quot;Unfortunately Y?hen the rationing scheme had to be started there v/as little or no baccn in the country,a As to the rations of the home Army, the amounts now beingreceived are understood to be as follows(1)   10 cz, butcherls meat per head per day (as rations)(2)     2 oz0 bacon per head per day (as rations)(3)   I1 oz meat offal per head per day, represent-7 ing the average purchase from the RegimentalCanteens through the medium of the cosh allowances issued in excess of the ration in kind.This is equivalent to at least 14 os, of butcherrs meat perday.Approximate iy/
Approximately 000,000 of the men consuming this emount of meat are engaged in work involving no undue physical strain while a certain proportion are doing no bodily labour at all.     No reason can be given for maintaining this large supply of meat except the administrative difficulty of differentiation.     I cannot think that any mere administrative difficulty ought to be allowed to justify perpetuation of so glaring a contrast as that between 14 oz. per day for the soldier not on active service or training for such service, and the 3 oz. per day for the ordinary civilian or 4-j oz. for the civilian on the hardest hodily labour.There are a number of cases in which differentiation would obviously be simple, e.g. Home Defence and Labour Units, or officers and men on clerical duties in the War Office and elsewhere who are still allowed individually to draw their full Army rations.     Though these are relatively small classes, the fact that they receive so much larger rations than the ordinary public has given rise to widespread and growing dissatisfaction.I may add that the scientific dietetic experts of the Royal Society, who have been consulted on this matter, are of opinion that the present Army ration which as stated is the equivalent of 14 oz. of butcher&apos;s meat per day is considerably in excess of the reasonable physiological requirements for sedentary work, even under the climatic conditions imposed on home service troops on the North East Coast.With regard to the Army in the Field, it is understood that recent experiments have ^een made with the full concurrence of the Field Marshal Commanding-,in-Chief in the direction of a reduction of the meat ration, at any rate of troops not directly engaged in fighting in the field.     If, as a result of these experiments it is found that physical efficiency has not been impaired, a general reduction might be introduced at any rate for the summer months.
With regard to the question of meat reserves, I should point out that the bulk of them are held by the Army - the quantity of frozen meat held in reserve by the Ministry of Food for civilian consumption being about two weeks supply.I agree, however, with Sir Alfred Mond that the proper course is to utilise such reserves as we have during the next two or three months, looking to the influx of grass-fed cattle on the lsi July onwards as well as the importation of American meat to provide supplies and a reserve for the later months of the year.     It would be very uneconomical to slaughter grass-fsd cattle in the next three months, when by   feeding them on the grass they would produce a much larger volume of meat in the later months of the year,I suggest therefore: -(1) That an immediate and substantial reduction should be made in the meat ration issued to the 600,000 men in the Home Army engaged in work involving no undue physical strain and that enquiry should be made into the question of a more general reduction affecting all men not actually in or close behind the front line, or about to go into the line.(2) That during the period when grass-fed cattle are available the reserve of frozen meat may safely be reduced to the average reserve held at that time   of the year in each of the last two years.(5) That the supplies thus released should be utilised to prevent the slaughter of Immature cattle and if possible to Increase the civilian ration.Ministry of Food, HHONDDA.20th March, 1918.
