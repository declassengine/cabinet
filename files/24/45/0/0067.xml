SESSSL JIBS DROPPED IF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE AREA 7/S h marVjh. 1918,    1   1On this raid an estimated total weight of 2860 lbs of &quot;Sf&amp;s dropped in the Metropolitan Police Area.     The exact &quot;weigfet cannot yet bs dc^bermiiied as in one Xjast&amp;nce a bomb &amp;xpld4&amp;&amp; some dXjrta&amp;&amp;e^bj^n1?^?^^ i^npei and no crater was found;    the^sNtsr-cfaee of the ground being merely lifted .up about Z feet pver a diameter of 25 feet.The effect of the various types of bombs are dealt with aeri^ttr&quot;&apos;V3lcw.00 kg, bombs.Only one bomb of this weight was used during this raid and it fell approximately on the dividing wall of Nos. 65 and 63 Harrington Crescent; St. John&apos;s Wood.&quot;   It exploded on impact and demolished Nos, 67, 65, 63 and 6l.     The houses were well built brick buildings of four storeys, and in all four cases the two upper storeys were demolished;    in the case of Nos. 65 and 63 the fyzlk of the masonry from these houses was blown sideways on to Nos. 67 and 6l and the lower storeys of these houses collapsed under the additional weight of masonry, which then fell down into the basement.     The basements of Nos. 63 and 65 were not so badly damaged as the inertia.of the bomb was destroyed on explosion.     One noteworthy feature was the great concussion produced by this bomb;    all the doors and windows of houses up to a distance of 50 yards from the explosion were blown out and in many cases partition walls in these houses were blown down.The fragmentation of this bomb was also particularly good, the houses on the opposite side of the street were badly pitted by the fragments over a length of 150 yards, and in one Or two instances fragments had penetrated a 14 inch brick wall.     Portions of the walls of bombs of this type have been found more than 2 inches thick and weighing as much as 12 lbs which explains tho great penetrating power of the fragments. 12 persons were killed and 29 injured by this bomb.100 kg. bombs.During this raid five bombs of this weight were dropped. Three of them fell on open ground near Addison Way, Go,lders Green, and did no damage other than wreck a few windows.A fourth fell at the rear of a small two storey house -No. 16 Totteridge Lane, XThetstone, blowing dewn the back additions of 2 houses and the side wall of a third.     One man was killed and one woman and one child were injured at No. l6.A fifth bomb of this weight fell in the roadway opposite Nos. 14 and l6 Burnland Road, Battersea, making a crater 20 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep.     The edge of the crater extended under the front wall of the houses;    the front rooms up a.nd downstairs in both houses were completely demolished, the force of the explosion also lifted Qff the roof.
The occupants of the houses were in the hack portions of the premises at the time and of them only one man was slightly injured.All these 100 kg, bombs wsre fused with delay action fuzes,Ten bombs of this weight were dropped, one of which failed to explode.These bombs were of the 50 kg. type usually employed by enemy aeroplanes when raiding this country, with the exception mentioned above      the rear of Totteridge Crescent where a bomb burst underground.   This caas is being investigated.Eight of the regaining 10 boj&amp;bs of this weight foil either into gardens or into open ground and the damage in these cages was confined to glass and brickwork,In the remaining two instances via. 11, Nsw Street, St. John *s Wood, and 32, B*l*ifle Square, H&amp;mpsteftd, the bombs fell on houses. In the first eags tho house was a small one of two storeys s,nd it was completely demolished by a bomb fitted with &amp; delay action fuze, Half of the houses on each side of No,11 were cut in half and brought down from the roof to the floor. Six persons were killed hy this bomb.In tho reasoning instance at Beltiae   Square a 50 kg. bomb burst on impact with the upper portion of the dividing wall between Hos. 31 and 32.   The houses were strongly built and only the roofs were blown off end tho top storeys wrecked .   The ceilings, plaster , etc, were brought down, however, right tc tho ground floor,There i% only one vary doubtful instance of the employment of an incendiary bomb during this raid;     this was at Kb, 56 Warrington Crescent which is almost exactly opposite the spot at which the 300 kg . bomb fell.It seq&amp;s extremely probably that as the houses on the opposite side of the street were so severely damaged by concuss! and as gas pipes were known to have been le&amp;o&amp;ett and that therewars fires Jft4fci*rMlf* *% %fa$ %im&amp; , tfe&amp;* the wreckage oaught fi from one of the afetre aous**ee.The bombs eaplayed on thia raid present no new features &amp;$d examples sf nil the types have been dropped on previous raids on London.- - r.&apos;; M ^ s;: *v.. -:i fi1       .&apos;:A (.) .^ v,1        i
NOTES ON THE EFFECT Q^r BUILDINGS - OF THE PHINCJPAL^TYPES OF BOMBS DROPPED BY ENEMY AIRCRAFT IN THE METROPOLITAN POLICE DISTRICT IN RECENT RAIDS. &quot;      &quot;The explosive &quot;bombs of which most use has been made in aeroplane raids on London are the 50 kg. (110 lb.) and the 12 kg. (25 lb.) bombs.     Recently, with the introduction of the &quot;giant&quot; bombing aeroplane, heavier bombs have been brought into use, including uombs of 300 kg.   The total weight of bombs carried by one of these machines in a raid to London is about 2000 &quot;lbs,300 kg, (650 lb.) bombs.(l)       One 300 kg. bomb was used in the aeroplane raid of 7th/8th March,   This bomb fell approximately on the dividing wall between No a. 63 and 65 in a row of well built four-storey houses in Warrington Crescent, St. John1a Wood. The bomb exploded on impact and demolished the two upper storeys in Nos. 63 and 65 ,   and threw the bulk of the masonry on to the adjoining houses Nos. 61 and 67, the floors of which collapsed under the additional weight and fell into the basement, the interiors of these buildings being completely wrecked.     The basements of Nos. 63 and 65 on which the bomb fell were not so badly damaged as in the houses at the sides.    (See photographs Nos, 1 and 2).No. 63 was unoccupied at the time: one person was on the sesond floor of Ho. 65 and was injured.    In No. 67 the seven occupants, who were on the ground floor, were all killed or injured, and in No. 67, of the-ten occupants only one, who was in the basement, escaped injury, and six of the ten were killed.The effects of the concussion of this bomb were very remarkable,    Doors and windows of houses within a distance of 50 yards of the explosion were blown out , and in some of these houses partition walls were thrown down.The fragmentation of the bomb was also particularly effective.   Houses on the opposite side of the street were badly pitted by the fragments over a length of 150 yards, and a few of the fragments had penetrated 14 inch brick walls,(2)       One 300 kg. bomb, fitted with a delay-action fuse, was used in the aeroplane raid of 16th/l7th February, 1918.   This bomb fell on a wing of the Royrl Hospital, Chelsea, passed through the rcof and two floors, penetrated the basement floor (thick ooncrete with brick below) and exploded in the earth beneath the basement,    (The nose piece of the bomb was found buried in the ground nearly 5 feet below tho level of the basement floor).The ^plosion blew to pieces the two houses forming the end of the wing and scattered the debris over a wide area, leaving a large crater where the building had stood.    (See photographs 3 and 4), IThere were eight persons in one of the houses, three in the basement , and five on the first floor.   All those in the basement and two of the five on the first floor were killed, the others being injured.   The other house was empty at the time, the occupants having token shelter elsewhere.On account of the depth at which this bomb exploded,  the air disturbance was slight, compared to that caused by the bomb which fell at Harrington Crescent on 7th/8th March.
(3) Two 300 kg. &quot;bombs were dropped in the Metropolitan areain the Zeppelin Raid of l?th/20th October, 1917.    One of these bombs fell at the rear of a row of email houses at Hither Green and completely demolished three of them.     The other bomb fell on one of a row of four-storey houses near the junction of Albany Road with Calmington Ror-c, i&apos;amberwell. It completely demolished two of the houses and one smallepone. The two four-storey houses were completely blown down with the exception of the dividing wall between them.    A dozen other houses and shops in the vicinity were seriously damaged. (See photographs $ and 6.).Sixteen persons were in the demolished houses, and had taken refuge in the basement.     Of these two were killed, four were injured, and ten escaped injury.In each of the above cases ftos. 1, 2, and 3* the building struck were of ordinary brick and wood construction.     There has as yet been no case where a ^00 kg. bomb has struck a reinforced concrete building, or a wall-built brick building with concrete  $$ar floors.(4) Tho i&amp;ombs which feil on 93  ong Acre (Messrs Odham&apos;sPrinting Works) in the aeroplane raid qf 23th/29th January, 1918, was probably of 100 kg. weight.   This bomb penetrated the rr*of (slates on wooden beams), a floor of beards on steel joists and another floor of 3/Bin. steel plates over 6 inch breeze The building was about 80 years old, and was one of the first-iron framework buildings erected in London.     At the time of the raid it was heavily loaded with rolls of printing paper and machinery.     The explosion wrecked a portion of the upper floors and the heavy debris, rolls of paper and machinery, foil on to and wrecked the portions of ground floor and basement beneath.   (See photograph Ho. 7)*     in addition to wrecking this portion of the building, the bomb started a fire which rapidly spread until the whole building was involved.     The tcp steroy was completely destroyed, and serious damage caused throughout.The building was being made use of as an air raid shelter and about 200 persons wore in it when it was struck.    Of these 36f including 19 women and 9 children, were killed, and including 28 women and 14 children; were injured.     A few bodies may still be buried beneath the debris,, which have not ye&quot; boon entirely cleared away.Considerable use has been made of this bomb and the 12 kg (25&quot; V&amp;*) bomb in tho aeroplane raids on Lendon.     The effect of the 12 kg. bomb on buildings is comparatively slight, but the fragmentation of the bomb is particularly good, and many casualties were caused by it in the daylight air raids aming persons who had not taken proper cover. The following notes (Hoa 2,6 and 7)) describe three typical instances of the effect of ifce  0 kg. bomb.    No. B is m exceptional ens.(?) A $0 kg. bomb fell on Nn. $1  joiaman Street, S,C., in the air raid of 7th July, 1917* -no &quot;comb penetrated the slate roof and exploded en impact with tho floor of the top s$$rcy. The&quot;top floor and a portion of the floor below -K?ore wrecked; the lower storey was practically nn-damaged. Tho floors were ef 14 inch concrete carried on steel joists. (*3ee photograph No, 6).The abc-e ssay be considered typical of the effect of this bomb in case of a direct hit on a building of strong construction. The bomb will probably explode on the first concrete floor it encounters&quot;; this floor may be brokpn ar. more or less damage caused on the floor below, but floors lower still are not likely to suffer serious injur
(6) A 50kg. bomb fell on No, 144a King1a Cross Road In tho air raid of 24th September, 1917, It penetrated the roof and two floors and then exploded, completely wrecking the top two storeys and seriously damaging the storey below. (See photograph No. 9.) The effect of this bomb is typical of the action of the 50 kg. bomb on a brick building of good size *(7)     A 50 kg. bomb fell on a row of small ill-constructed houa-ea. In Snap Street, Hoxton.,   Cno house, and the greater portions of the two adjoining houses were completely demolished. (See photograph No. 10).(8)     In the raid of 29th September, 1917, a 50 kg. bomb 3truck the pavement immediately at the foot of a wall of the Eaglet Public House, Seven Sisters Road, N.   It penetrated obliquely into the basement and exploded there, completely wrecking the ground floor and basement, leaving the upper storeys comparatively undamaged.   (See photograph No. 11).Forty or fifty persons from the upper floors and from the street had taken refuge in the rear portion of the basement? and of these four were killed and thirty-two injured.   If the bomb had struck the building or had fallen a few feet away from it, these persons, who were In the safest part of the building, would probably have escaped Injury.
