(THIS SOCIfiiEtlT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BgS^gMIC MAJESTY1 S GOVgHMEgTj,SEC H B T. G.T,.-3998.WAS     GAB I I E I,IIJTER-ALLI2D GENERAL RESERVE.Wromi   The Military Representative of the United States.To:      The Executive Committee.1.    The American Permanent Military Representative, member of the Executive Committee, submits to his colleagues on-the Executive Committee, the following views which he proposes for their consideration.2.     It is hie view that the Supreme War Council in its Resolution of February  n&amp; decreed the creation of an Inter-Allied General Reserve and charged the Executive Committee with cortain duties as to ito composition end use.     This decreo and those instructions of the Supreme War Council are mandatory, and the Executive Committee cannot abdicate the duties and responsibilities with which it is char- od, merely because a Comman&amp;er-in-Chief hee stated that he cannot agree with it as to one point, which point is a question of method and procedure rather than of goneral principle.3.     The letter of February 6th was not final and conclusive, although it conveyed what was at that time the best judgment of the Executive Committee as to the formation of the Inter-Allied General Reserve.   It was a basis of discussion with the Commando is-in-Chief, in whioh the Executive Committee formulated its ideas and submitted them in compliance with that part of the Resolution of the Supreme Tfer Council which required that its &quot;powers should be exercised after consultation with the Commanders-in-Chief of the Armies concerned^&quot;     This means that the Executive Committee must give careful consideration to t-be views of the C* mmcnders-in-Chief; but those latter have no power, by a mere difference of opinion, to abrogate the will of the Supreme War Council nor to discharge the Executive Committee from the execution of the functions Imposed upon it by that V/ar Councile In case of en irreconcilable difference of opinion between the Executive Committee and the Commander-in-Chief, it is tho duty of the former to exercise its best judgment, to organise the Inter-Allied General Heserve according to that best judgment, to report to tha Supremo War Council -that it has ?3erforme  in full the duty which that War Council imposed u-sonl,it, and, therefore, to submit the organisation which iii thinks best for the Inter-Allied General Reserve, le^ing the Supreme war Council to modify this organisation at its pleasure.The Committee created bs the.,Supreme War Council is an executive ondi and not an advisor^ one;   and it is the duty of an executive committee to carry something into execution.   This particular Executive Committee is charged with the d$uv of carrying into execution the
mandatory will of the Supreme War Council whan it decreed the creation of an Inter-Allied General Reserve.     The Supreme War Council is composed solely of the heads of the four great Governments which constitute the Alliance for the prosecution of the war,       that is to say, it is composed of these four Governments.     The Executive Committee is, therefore, the agent \ for carrying into affect the expressed will of the Entente AlliaJ This Alliance has not placed it in the power of any Commander-in J Chief to veto its will;   nor has it given to the Executive Commit] any authority to listen to or to he gi&amp;ed by any such attempted ve to,It has been suggested that, perhaps, if one Commander-in-Chil says that he is unable to contribute any troops to the Inter-Allied Genoral Reserve, the other Commanders-in-Chief will do thJ same.    Who is to decide this?    Manifestly, it is neither the Commandore-in-Chief nor the Executive Committee, but solely the Entente Alliance itself.     How can the Alliance determine whs then a particular Commander-in-Chief can or cannot contribute troops j to the Inter-Allied General Reserve?    Primarily, it can do this only after consideration of tha best judgement of its Executive j Committee as expressed in the final organization prepared by the Executive Committee.     The Executive Committee cannot, because it bag no powdr to do so, bo guided by the views of any Commander- I in-Chief who, in effect, opposes himself to the expressed will of the Entente Alliance,     The Executive Committee must be guided   j by those views of Commanders-in-Chief which are helpful to it in its execution of the mandate of tho Alliance as represented by   j the Supremo &apos;7ar Council.     If those views arc not helpful to it, the Executive Committoe must use its best judgement in the for- I nation of an Intor-Allied Genoral Reserve and allow the Commander in-Chief to maho his protest to the Supremo TTar Council, j4.     The lottor of February 6th, which was the basis of discussic with tho Commanderg*in-Chiof, having been submitted to thorn, certain written and vurbsl consultations with tho French and Italian O&amp;m&amp;nlarifc&apos; -in-Chief whioh followed resulted in an agree-mnt with them which was a modification of the original scheme^ Tho consultation with the British Command or-in-Chief has resulted in a statement by him to tha effect that he has made plans to assist, if necessary, any other part of tha Franco-British Front with a force which is substantially tha same as that which was asked of him by the Executive Committee in the lottor of February 6th.    But he declines to set this force apart in any particular area, for the reosona given by hit! in his latter to tho Executive Committee.    His views are not at all inconsistent with the per-formance of his share in tho creation of the Inter-Allied General Reserve,    His letter concedes in principle all that has been asked of him.     It is not absolutely necessary that his Inter-Allied Reserve divisions should be stationed in any particular area or areas,     It is sufficient for our purpose that they exist somewhere in his zone of operations,     In case of difference of opinion on such a point it is better that the Executive Committee should subordinate its judgement to that of tho local Commander-in-chief.It is true that the British Commander-in-chief contemplates the use of his Reserves solely for the assistance of the British Pronis This is not a point in regard to which the Executive Committoo need, at this time urge any objection, Tha chances are very great that the British part&apos; of the Intor-Allied Reserve will eventually bo used either on its own front or on the French front;   and thera are the samo chances that the French part of thi
3 *.350General Reserve will eventually be used only on its front or on the British front.     If tho development of the campaign should ever make it necessary to consider the question of sending any of these forces to the Italian front, the situation at the time would undoubtedly be such that this step would be takon only by the common consent of all.     It is quite certain that if there were any reasonable doubt at the time, the Executive Committeej which must act unanimously, would not take such action,    it eny rate, this is a bridge which wo need not attempt to cross until we come to it.5.     The isecutive Committee has, therefore, succeeded in the execution of tho task assigned to it by the Supreme &quot;Jar Council, to the extent of forming an Inter-Allied General Reserve consisting of a certain number of Italian,   French, and British divisions, subject to certain oonditions desired to be imposed by the respective Consnanders-in-Chief and which conditions are not in-consistent v/ith the These divisions aregeneral principle of the Inter-Allied Reserve, as follows:-fa)fb)ITALIAN FRONT:     Six Italian Divisions, plus four Frenoh Divisions (or as many as may not be withdrawn from Italy) now serving on the Italian Front;FRENCH FRONT:      Eight French Divisions, being themaximum number which the Frenoh Commander-in-Chief has agreed, --hen necessary and possible, to send to the assistance of the English Front;(c)   BRITISH FRONT:     Eight British Divisions, being themaximum number which the British Commander-in-Chief has agreed, vrhen necessary and possible, to send to tho French Front.It seems reasonable to assume that if any British Divisions aro returned to that Front from the Italian Front, they rill be available to increase that pirt of the General Reserve on that Front.Thus, the Inter-Allied General Reserve, subject to certain conditions which are not incompatible with tho principle of a General Reserve, would consist of twenty-six Divisions, having an approximately total strength of 316,000 men exclusive of Army artillery and Aviation.6. Tho American permanent Military Representative, in his capacity as Member of the Executive Committee, proposos that the ExecutiveCommittee report to the Supreme the latterTs instructions -ar Council that, in compliance with(a)(b)It has constituted an Inter-Allied General Reserve consisting of twenty-six Divisions, of which for the present ten are to remain in the Italian theatre of wareight in the French British theatre;theatre of war, and eight in theThat all of tho correspondence, or a resume of it, between tho Executive Committee and the respective Commanders-in-Chief, on the subject of the Inter-Allied General Reserve, be submitted to the Supreme Council in order that it, acting for the Entente Alliance, may pass upon the validity of any protest made against the proposed composition of tho General Reserve.reme TTar Council.
