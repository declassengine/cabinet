There is, however, only a limited demand for men in the early days of March since the principal lambings in Scotland do not become due until the 10th - 15th April.     Although the numbers who have reported to date are more than sufficient for immediate requirements they are far from meeting the total number of applications.     It is hoped, therefore, that a further supply of men may be made available 3 or 4 weeks hence and that the more capable of the men who have already been released may have their furlough extended so that they may be employed throughout April andOrders under Defence of the Realm Retaliation 2M.Farm or LandsPalmallet Rsiffer Park Dalreagle Corwar, Outon AitehisonTs Bank Raoburnhead Bardristane Holehcuse, Oulshamand Millhall ClochtowUpper and Lower Bdge CleishCounty	SectionWigtown	(1)   fe)do.
