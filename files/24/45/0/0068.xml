&apos;.. ;.:;eetyJs &quot;Government.)Property of\ RESPONSIBILITY FOR DECISIONS WITHt&amp;S^r ----oooOooo----I am unable to agree with the suggestion of Lord Newton (G.T.3900) that he should be responsible for the decision of all questions relating to prisoners of war and empcwered to issue directions to the War Office, Admiralty and HomeThe Home Office is not concerned in the two questions particularly mentioned as examples in Lord Newton&apos;s memorandum:   but it appears to me that the War Office and Admiralty ought to have the final decision of all questions relating to the repatriation, not only of combatant prisoners of war, but also of all able-bodied men including merchant seamen who, if returned to enemy countries, could be utilized in the prosecution of the war.The Home Office is concerned in this connection with (l) the internment and release or repatriation of civilians, and (2) the management of certain internment oamps.As to (l), it appears to me that the Home Secretary, as responsible for internal safety, should have the deciding voioe in the questions of interning persons who are potentially dangerous in this country and of releasing such persons or licensing them for employment outside the camps.     These questions involve moreover constant communication in each individual case with the Police, who in this matter report to me and accept my instructions in a way which would be impracticable if any other Department were charged with the responsibility for internment and release.As to (2) the great majority of civilian prisoners are interned in camps in the Isle of Man;   and these camps are managed on the civilian side by the Government of the Isle of I.Ian? over which the Home Office exercises a general control.     The questions which arise are complex and difficult:   and the Home Office alone has the experience of local conditions and the authority over the Government of the Island which are required for dealing with these natters.Office.G. CAVE.19th March, 1918.
