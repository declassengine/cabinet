(This Document ?s the Pre.::-&apos; /v..*:-rj &quot;i-s^rvinio (V?a!esty&apos;s Govern-&quot;Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. C 23.MEMORANDUM Off THE CAUCASUS.General SituationtThe arrival of German forces at Odessa brings the question of the Caucasus again into immediate prominence.     As relations between the Georgians and the Ukraine in particular have recently been -very clnse, it is important to consider the complications that may ensue from the fact that the Black Sea fleet will now be in German hands, and from the probability that they may now transfer some troops to Batum.The Georgian point of view in relation to these eventualities may be set down as follows:    they base their demands for recognition as an independent State on their treaty rights of 1783, although at the same time they want to work as far as possible in harmony with the Armenians and Tatars, supporting them in.the present confedera-tion of States in Trans-Caucasia.    If, however, Russia as a whole shows no likelihood of eventually evolving into a Federation of States, the Georgians would prefer to join a Black Sea Confederation (if such were formed) consisting of the South-Eastern Federation (Cossack), the Ukraine and Trans-Caucasia, with the object of opposing the schemes of&quot; Mittel-Europa.   The only difficulty in this connection is that all the other parties are perfectly aware of the reactionary tendencies of the Cossacks, who as a military caste enjoyed peculiar privileges under the autocracy and are on the whole disposed to look for the restoration of monarchy,   The Ukraine on the other hand, may be taken as being determinedly democratic andrepublican.It is perhaps worthy of recollection that of. the totall(*(Q T 3ft Cl )lo o 3.13
population of Odessa (600,000) at least one half are Jews, 100,000 of whom have immigrated from Rumania during the last twenty years, and &quot;been subject to very serious persecution in Russia,   They are naturally afraid that if Odessa remains part of&quot; the Ukraine, their fate in the future will be problematical, as the peasants in the Ukraine are very much opposed to the Jews.    The writer has been J^^rnaeds^ha-t since the creation of the Central Rada xln Kiev, a number - ^prominent Jews in Odessa sent a delegation to Berlin with the-proposal that Odessa port and district should be constituted as an &quot;independent republic - Odessa to be a free port - in which case it could be utilised for German expansion to the East,    it is possible that the Germans may make use of the principle of self-determination in support of this proposal, and arrange that the Odessa district should not be directly subject to the sovereignty cf the Ukraine.   Having secured Odessa and B a turn, they will then be in a position to make use of the Trans-Caucasian railway for their foreign trade to Baku and Trans-Caspia and, via Tiflis, to Tabriz, and as the eastern part of Asia Minor does not as yet possess railways and will not have them for a considerable time.- it-is obvious that.the Caucasus will become the main route to Western Asia, so that the centre of gravity will shift from Mesopotamia uf to the Caucasus.     But even in this case Mesopotamia would not be left alone, as the long tracts of Persia do not possess railways, and the Baghdad railway with its terminus will not be abandoned by Germany without a hard struggle.     Accordingly this diversion to the Caucasus would not really or ultimately relieve the pressure on Mesopotamia.   We are face to face with the possibility that the Caucasus may shortly be under German domination, and while the numbers of Georgian and Armenian troops are not inconsiderable, the:&apos; supplies of munitions are probably scanty, and they may be compellea to come to terms.
eThrough by Baku and by the Caspian Sea the Germans v. ill, of course, get in direct touch with countries farther East;   but into this matter we need not penetrate now.   The fact would remain thst Georgians and Armenians are to-day faced with the urgent necessity of doing the best that they can to preserve their independence.It is also possible to attempt a forecast as to the line of Turkish activity under German influence.   This will very likely take the direction of attempting to create division between the Georgians and the Armenians in the following manner :s  after detaching Batum and the Ardahan districts of Georgia, where the. majority&apos;v.pf the&apos; Georgian population are Mohamrh&amp;d&amp;n, Turkey will pi-ooaoly offer to recognise the independence of the remaining part of Georgia&apos;: - .. Even if the Georgians and the Armenians were to make resistance, there is one further difficulty to be reckoned with, namely, the masses ftf purely Russian troops remaining in the Caucasus and identifying themselves with the Bolshevik cause.   The Georgians ard Armenians have even now much work to do in merely preventing th-ee vagrant soldiers from looting and plundering..   The head of the Bolshevik movement in the Caucasus is one Shaumian, an Armenian, who is endeavouring to provoke ill-feeling between the Bolsheviks and the Armenians and Georgians by stating that the latter are endeavouring to break away from Russia.   From all the above it would appear essential for the British Government to continue to keep as far as possible in touch with the Georgians and Armenians, inasmuch as they repres-ent the only pro-Entente races left in Western Asia, while their mentality is of such a kind as can be counted upon to be useful in the preservation of British interests in these loc^ities^^even if for the time being they have -to -yield-to-force majeure.
The Trans-Caucasian Provisional Government..Scr far as our information goes, the Provisional Government of the Trans-Caucasian Republic, or so-called Commissariat, which came into existence on November 26th, 1917, is still at the head of affairs.     It will be recollected that it was- a Coalition of all the Socialist Democratic elements (Menshevik only) in Trans-Caucasia and was to act until the All-Russian Constituent Assembly should meet.   One result, however, of the National Georgian Assembly(see below) has been to bring out its artificial aAd temporary character into the strongest possible relief.   References to it both in speech and writing on the part of the Georgian community indicate that they regard it, and what it represents, merely as a passing phase.    The new Caucasian Republic, they argue, lacks historical tradition.    It is a geographical rather than a political and national unity and is as artificial as, say, a Balkan Federated Republic would have been.   They consider that it will be &quot;very difficult to maintain in one frame two rival Christian races&apos; like the Georgians, who are the legitimate owners of Western Trans-Caucasia, and the Armenians, who are largely guests in Trans-Caucasia, or to combine these two Christian races with the Tatars, who are still on a very low level of social development&quot; (Sakhartvelo, December 1, 1917)t   The adoption of such an attitude will naturally make it very difficult for the Provisional Government to work smoothly.     It seems as if precious time and energy may be wasted in adjusting rival claims, and that In the end the Trans Caucasian Republic will again split up into three independent republics - Georgian, Azerbaijan (Tatar) and Armenian.   This process may, however, be temporarily hindered by the following consideration (1) The mere recognition that affairs will eventually develop naturally in this direction may incline, the.-constituent-elements
to prolong the regime of the Provisional Government in order -to employ the interval for the conservation of the national energy. (2) Under the Provisional Government, the country may he better-able to meet the conditions produced by the retirement of the star-vi: Russian troops from the Turkish front, on the one hand, and the impending Turko-German invasion on the other.     (-3) Under the Provisional Government the Georgians in particular will be better able to safeguard their territory from any claims that may be made on the part cf the South-Eastern Federated Republic     The latest Georgian papers (end of December 1917) show a very marked desire for the closest of arrangements and understanding with the Armenians in view of the coming common danger.The Provisional Government has taken measures for issuingits own money - about 50 million roubles.   The Notes are to beallsecured on the combined property of/the Trans-Caucasian MunicipatitiThe Georgian National Assembly.This Congress of 320 delegates met on December 3 in Tiflis under the Presidency of Mr Jordania, the veteran leader of the Georgian Social Democratic party.   Its principal business was the election of a Supreme Council of 67 members to act as the leading authority for the Georgian nation and its representative in dealings with other nationalities.   Members were elected- in the following numbers, proportionate to the strength of the different parties: Social Democrats (Mensheviks) 20;    Independent non-party, 18; National Socialist   Federalists, 10;   National Democrats, 9; Social Democrat Nationalists, 4;   Socialist Revolutionaries, 3-Georgian Mohairmadans, 3.     Not a single Bolshevik finds a place upon the Council.   The principal decisions reached by the Assembly were as follows:    (S) With regard to the present political situation:    (1) The **fe Georgian nation, as a hundred &quot;years agov.
recognises the necessity of remaining with Russia.    (2) That the Georgian democracy, in conjunction with all other nationalities inhabiting Russia, considers the necessity of Russia being trans-formed into a Federated Republic.    (3) That the present Supreme Council will act until the National Assembly of the Georgian nation elects new delegates.    (4) That the National Assembly desires as the ideal form, the autonomous government of all the Georgianl ^territory, and that the boundaries of the future autonomous State4 ef Georgia shall be settled with the Tatars and with the Armenians.(b) Concerning the Internal administration of the Georgian terrlx-cry:    (1) That the Supreme National Council elected by this Congress shall be the authority elected by the representativesof the nation tc administer the country.    (2) Each locality and village shall be governed by elected councils.    (3) The local militia to be subject tc the control of the municipalities and communalities.    (4) The official language in all the government offices throughout Georgia to be Georgian.(c) concerning military affairs:   (1) The Georgian army to be subject to the Georgian General Staff,    (2) The entire male population from the age of twenty to forty to be mobilised.    (3) All the Georgian units at present sutside Georgian territory to return as speedily as possible.(d) Concerning finance:   That a special tax be introduced throug cut Georgia for the upkeep of national affairs.(8) Concerning food:    (1) That a Special Food Committee be appointed to organise the delivery of supplies of flour from the   &apos; Ukraine and Northern Caucasus.     (2) The National Council to organise a supply of seeds to the Georgian farmers and to take measures for increased production.    (3) Ad the Co-operation Movement is very strong in Georgia, the organising of food supplies and production should be arranged in conjunction with the Co-operative Societies.It may be noted that telegraphic communication with the Caucasian I Is temporarily interrupted.
