ETW/004.WEEKLY   REPORT   OK   TURKEY   &apos;\JD   OTHER   KQSMg   COUNTRIES.(March 20th,. 1918)! 1) The Turkish Advance on the Armenian Front.On March 1.3th the reoccupation of Erzerum, &quot;after somewhat serious resistance&quot; from the Armenian forces, was reported offic-ially by Constantinople.     Considerable military booty was claimed, but no prisoners.ifOn March l&quot;3th there was a rumour in the Petrograd. Press that the Turks had also occupied the Batum district.      If this is true, the Turkish front must be facing almost due east, and the advance in; the coast district must have been much more rapid than in the inter-ior.     The geography of the country makes this likely enough.    In the Turkish offensive of 1914, too, the Turkish left had already reached Ardahan when the main body was held up at Sarykamysh.On March &amp;8th the German wireless announced the entrance of German troops into Nikolayev, the Russian port and. naval dock-yard on the estuary of the Bug, east of Odessa, while on March 19th it was further reported that an armec force of 3000 ex-German prisoners had seised Rostov-an-Don.     This last event, if true, will give the German &quot;army of liberation&quot; in the Ukraine an excuse far continuing its eastward advance.     In fact the Germans are en-gaged in opening up.a route to Central Asia north of the Caucasus Range at the same time as the Turks are advancing south of it.Taken together,theyGerman and Turkish operations have already . brought practically all first-class Black Sea ports under enemy control.
Turkey and Armenia.On March 13th the German Wireless circulated extracts from an interview given &quot;by Hakki Pasha, the Turkish   Ambassador at Berlin, on uhe subject of        Kars, Batum and Ardahan.     Hakki expressed admiration for the great qualities of the Armenians;    recalled h w well Turkey had done by them in the past,&apos;;    regretted that, since 1878, Russia had led them astray;    and declared that &quot;as soon .as. the Armenians cease to contend with our Fatherland, they will again he regarded by us as brothers.&quot;Meanwhile atrocities against the Armenians are reported from Trebizond which rival those, of 1915,     Wholesale drowning in the Black Sea is said to have been resorted to on this occasion, as it was ,three years ago.     Male children,  especially,, have been thus-disposed of, while women and girls have been handed over, even more extensively than before, to Moslem families.Ww that Trans-Caucasia lies open to invasion, the Turks have -the chance of completing the work of 1915 by exterminating fh&amp;&apos; Russian half of the Armenian race, and doubtless this has been :H^-determined upon.     The resistance of the Armenian troops, and their unhappy atrocities at Erzingan, will give the pretext.Trans-Caucasia and the Peace of Brest-Litovsk.On March 13th the Swedish Press published a message stated to have been communicated by the Commissariat of Trans-Caucasia to. General Odec^esindez, the Commander-in-Chief of the Trans-Caucasian   armies, for transmission to Vesik Pasha, the Turkish--. Commander on the Armenian front,In this message, the Trans-Caucasian Commissariat put it on record that on March 2nd they had sent a wireless message &quot;to all&quot;, repudiating the authority of the Petrograd&quot; Government or any other body but themselves to make terms binding on Trans-Caucasia .
Several days later, apparently, the Turkish Government pro-posed to the Trans-Caucasian Government, through Vesik Pasha, that both parties should send commissioners to negotiate at Trebizond.     The three Turkish Commissioners (including Raouf Bey, Chief of the Admiralty Staff, and Nusret Bey, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs) left Constantinople by steamer on March 8th or 9th, and the Trans-Caucasian Commissioners have also presented themselves at the place agreed upon-     On March 10th, however, according to the Tiflis Commissariat&apos;s communique, Turkey pro-posed to General Odechevindez through Vesik Pasha that he should at once evacuate the Kars-Ardahan-Batum districts.     To this the Commissariat replied that &quot;they desired to be informed whether they were to consider the demand for the evacuation of the above-mentioned districts as being equivalent to the opinion that the Turkish Government considers it undesirable to conduct peace negotiations with the Government of the Caucasus&quot;.The reported occupation of these districts by the Turkish forces looks like a retort to this reply.     As was pointed out in last week1s report, the fate of these districts concerns the Georgians at least as much as the Armenians; but we have no information of any action or protest on the part of the Georgian National Council, nor is there any evidence that Georgian national troops (though such have certainly been organised) have joined in the resistance to the Turkish advance.It is possible, therefore, that the Georgians intend to take up the same attitude about the &quot;dis-annexed&quot; districts as the Ukrainians have taken about Eastern Galicia.     A statement by the Turkish Minister at Berne, reported by an agent on Feb. 28th, that &quot;the Turkish policy is to conclude an agreement with the Trans-Caucasian Republic, by which a Turkish Protectorate would would be established over the three districts in question&quot;, suggests that Turkey may hope to meet the Georgians half-way by
foregoing direct re-annexation.The composition of the Trans-Caucasian Commission at Trebizond is not yet known, but, like the Commissariat at. Tiflis, it probably contains representatives of the different nationalities-     The obvious policy for the Turks is to break up Trans-Caucasian unity by setting the nationalities against one another.     The Tatars are already on their side, and they have only to drive a wedge between the Georgians and Armenians. Meanwhile&apos;, if the negotiations lead to nothing,  he  ufipdh troops will no doubt continue their advance even -$:e^ft&amp;:?&amp;fe frontier of 1877. )     Russian Central Asia. \On March 13th there was a rumour in the Petrograd:Press that civil war had broken out in Central Asia on racial lines. Twenty thousand casualties were reported, apparently during barricade-fighting in the towns.The breick-down of railway communications and consequent isolation of Central Asia, for some weeks, or even months, past makes it likely that this outbreak, if true, has arisen purely out of the local situation.     The land question and latent-Moslem fanaticism offered sufficient inflammatory material. At the same time, the course of events in Central Asi^ will no doubt be affected by the present Turco-German advance.,, the Turks and Germans,  in turn, will be encouraged to advance further by the Central Asiatic, situation. 5)     Persia.On March 9th Sir C. Marling telegraphed that there had been no outbreak at Kazvin, but that the British Consuls, both there and at Tabriz, reported the situation to be&apos; very threatening.Meanwhile the ^augelis had seized Ardebil; the Shah appeared to be making arrangements for feeing from Teheran; a nonentity - ITasr-ed-din Mir a a. - had &quot;been appointed titular
chief of the Persian Cossack Brigade, and the Russian officers had &quot;been asked at the same time to enter into a formal contract with the Persian Government.     The Russian officers had refused.On March 10th a letter, dated March 7th, from Obeidullah to Iluchik Khan, the Jangali leader, was interpreted,rObeidullah declared that the Turkish troops on the Armenian front were being transferred to the fronts of Palestine and Mesopotamia, together with considerable forces supplied by Turkey&apos;s allies, and that in consequence the Turks would shortly be in a position to advance in the direction of Hamadan.This letter is probably bluff.     The best troops on the Armenian front were transferred long ago, and the Turkish army there is believed to be small and of poor moral.     It is only able to advance there because the disintegration on the Russian side has beer-still greater, and this very advance is likely to keep it fully occupied.On the other hand, a notice in the Neue Freie Presse   of March 11th to the effect that the Parcel Post to Turkey has been temporarily suspended suggests movements of enemy troops to the Turkish fronts from Europe.On March 11th Mustasc.fi-ul-Mamalek once more resumed office as Prime Minister of Persia, and on the same date our hinister presented the British Government^ rlor^e, informing the Persian Government of the forthcoming despatch of British troops to N.Vr. Persia.     &quot;The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who seemed to expect the note, made no comment.On inarch 12th Sir C. Marling telegraphed that the British Consul at Tabriz had informed him that he had received no news from Trans-Caucasia for a fortnight.     Rorth-hest of Tabriz, both railway and telegraph appear to be out of working-order.Our Minister further stated that he was sending messengers
fan    Q    mto Trans-Caucasia by both. Tabriz and Balm. (6)     Jewish Affairs.On March 9th the Jewish Press Bureau at Stockholm issued a communique protesting against the omission of any stipulations &quot;concerning the granting of equal civil and political rights to Rumanian Jews&quot; in the preliminary Treaty of Peace between Rumania and the Central Powers.     The guarantees desired are laid down in the latter part of the communique.It is reported from Copenhagen that the Germans are buying land Haifa and espropriiating local (Jewish?) proprietors.     The German Consul is said to be acting as purchasing agent, and the title-deeds are stated to he ante-dated, in order to deceive the British authorities in the event of a British occupation.
