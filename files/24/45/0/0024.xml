( i his Document 13 the PreIntelligence Bureau,Department of Information.14.3.18.c. 22.MEMORANDUM ON SIBERIA.Some Physical Character!sties.Under the name Siberia (Russian Sibir) are included all the Russian possessions in Asia,   These are bounded on the West by the Ural Mountains; 011 the North by the Arctic Ocean, on the East by the North Pacific, and on the South by a line which runs from the sources of the river Ural to the Tarbagr- tai range, thence along the Northern Chinese frontier as far as the South-East corner of Trans-Baikalia, thereafter along the rivers Argun, Amur and Ussuri to the Korean frontier.   The area covered by this dominion extends to about dJ million square miles, and is divided very -naturally in three more or less parallel East and West zones.   Of these the tundra is the most Northerly, a swampy region practically treeless extending inland to a depth varying from 150 to 400 miles, with perpetually^en subsoil, where brown lichen and grey moss have a hard struggle for life.   This passes imperceptibly into the taiga or forest zone, mountainous in part, and almost impenetrably covered with Siberian poplar, spruce, larch, cedar, pitch pine, Siberian spruce, birch and alder.   To the South is a more open, or agricultural, zone; with an area suitable for cultivation and settlement about 2\ times that of Prance.   Through it runs the Siberian post track, passing through the principal towns en route, to be succeeded by the Great Siberian Railway which was begun in 1092 and finally completed ten veers later.   The most direct route from Tchelyabinsk to Vladivostok via Kaidalovo and Harbin represents a disoance cf roughly 4,000 miles.   The total railway mileage in Siberia is not yet twice that figure, while the U*ScA. with a
superficial area half that of Siberia has a mileage of 250,000. The original aim behind the construction cf the Trans-Siberian railway, in which the ex-Emperor took a very great personal interest, was primarily political, and secondarily economic.The principal rivers, Ob. Yenisei, Lena, and Amur, the main stream of each of which is formed by the confluence of two branches coming from widely separated points, afford means of access from the North and East far Into the interior.   Between them they have 11,000 miles of navigable water.   There is, however, one drawback. Rising far to the South the waters of the first three reach their ice-bound mouths in the spring, producing flooding on an enormous scale, while the ice-free period is comparatively short.   Canals connecting some of the main tributaries of the principal Siberian river systems, and thus increasing facilities for East and West travel, are an assured feature of the future development of the country.History and Population.Siberian history is ordinarily associated with the names of Yermak, and Stroganov his superior, the Perm merchant prince, at whose suggestion he undertook his first expedition towards the East in 1580.     Fuller and more accurate research tends to show that the conquest of Western Siberia was really more directly due to a process of peaceful penetration by a population moving from the Volga to the Ob from the eleventh century onwards.   The history of Russia in Siberia, especially in its Vies tern part, thus dates from the time of the Novgorod Rus Republic.   The later fighting of the adventurers, half brigand and half merchant, under Yermak and others, cannot really be said to have so much resulted in the conquest of territory which was already Russian to much the same extent as the territory on the other side of the Urals, as in the
substitution of the rule of the Tsar for that of the Tatar Khan. Kith the exception of a temporary check from the Chinese in the later part of the 17th century the Russian movement towards the Pacific was unstayed in its gradual assimilative character.     In particular, General Muraviev-Amur3ki played a leading part In the work of annexation in Eastern Siberia during the progress of the Crimean War.There are four distinct units in Russia in Asia, the first three of which constitute the geographical area of Siberia, each of thf,;a acquired in a different way and each presenting a different economic and political problem.   They are:(l) Siberia proper, composed of two Tie stern Governments CTobolsk and Tomsk) and four Eastern (Yeniseisk, Irkutsk, Yakutsk and Trans Baikal).(2) The Far East Country which Is a continuation of Siberia ard consists of the Amursk and Maritime (Primorsk) territories, the Kamchatka peninsula and the Western part of Sakhalin,(3) The Steppe Country which divides Siberia from Russian Central Asia and embraces four territories, Uralsk, Turgaisk, Akmolinsk and Semipalatinsk.(4) Russian Turkestan, comprising the Transcaspian, Syr Daryan, Samarkand, Fergansk and Semiretchensk Territories with the protectorates of Bokhara and Khiva.(1)   Of the total population of Siberia proper, as above defined, which is nine millions, Russians form 86.5/9;   natives account...fox 10.9$, while the remaining 2.6;-S is made up of those Asiatic natives who migrated back from Russia writhout having fused with -the Russians in the progress.   - The principal-towns are Omsk (128,000), Irkutsk (127,000 in 1911), Tomsk (111,000), and-4Cra^c7^sk--Cl3^000).
&quot;The majority of native tribes are very primitive (Samoyedes, Tchuktchi, etc.), and the principal question in their case is that of protecting them from extinction.   There are, however, one or two notable exceptions, in particular the Buriats who inhabit territory on both sides of Lake Baikal, although in greater numbers on the Eastern side.    They are a sober, strong, intelligent people of Mongolian stock, originally nomadic cattle-breeders, but for many years they have been engaged in agricultural and industrial pursuits in which they meet with marked success.   They have also very largely adopted Russian modes of life and law.   This developing national self-consciousness came into expression in the Revolution of 1905, and very shortly after the Revolution of 1917 they held a National Congress (April 14th) at which they put forward the demand for territorial autonomy and a Buriat Parliament.   The Executive Committee of this National Council has since taken other steps in the direction of feeling their&apos;way into association with other elements eueh as the Yakutes and Kalmucks, and in the establishment of their language as the medium of instruction in all Buriat schools.   From the commencement of their contact with the invading Cossacks from the West, the Buriats have held their own in a very remarkable way, resisting all attempts at assimilation, and numbering 350,000 they nay play an important role in connection with the possible advent of the Japanese with whom they have very marked mental as well as physical affinities.   They may be tempted to give special assistance to the Japanese if they think they can thereby secure in return some further recognition and strengthening of their autonomy.The Subiriak, by whom should be understood the colonial descended from settlers who have been coming into the country from the Middle Ages down, let us say, to 1896, Is quite a distinctive type, differing In..certain..-slight physical characteristic
in the older families even from the Great or little Russian. They are descended fror the Cossacks who first conquered the country and other adventurous elements, serfs who were sent out by the Government as settlers from time to time, exiles political and criminal, and deserters from the Greek Church who were either banished to Siberia or vent there of their own accord.   That is to say, the original Russian population of Siberia consists for the most part of men and women who were In some way, Intellectually and physically, more active or more earnest than their fellow-countrymen who remained in European Russia.    The result is that to-dav the average Sibiriak is a more vigorous, intelligent, enterprising and up-to-date individual than the average European Russian.   This is as true of his interest in agricultural implements as in political and Social ideas.    &quot;All the Sibiriaks are peasants and none of ther. is a peasant&quot;.   All these characteristics have entered into his relationship to his country.    The writer had occasion to work out a developmental comparison between Canada and Siberia from many points of view, the result of which went to show that in many respects the advantage lay with Siberia.   Of all the various Slav elements inhabiting the Russian State the Sibiriak is probably the one who will best look after the interests of his own country when faced with the predatory designs of an invader.    The bravery oi the Siberian regiments in the early stages of the war became a proverb in Russia.   The history of the Siberian Cossacks differs in some respects from that of the European Cossacks.   Thus, they have played a greater part in the internal affairs of the country than did the European Cossacks in those of any other region of European Russia.    They formed a social class through which the Russificstion of those natives whose national feeling was not strong enough to resist it, was attempted with considerable success. Further, they have always been very strong supporters of the
Imperial regime, which would not, however, prevent them from feeing revolutionary if any Government attempted to limit their privileges. They will prove to he a more stable element in Siberia at the present time than their European Russian compeers, but under normal circumstances are not disposed to favour a settled and progressive mode of life,(2) The Far East Country. - After Manchuria, where there is a Chinese population of ab^ut 20 million nominally subject to the Chinese Government,(although, as the result of Bolshevik attempts to gain control, this authority has been latterly somewhat tightened up) this is the region which w^ill feel the first effects of a Japanese intervention.   Although these rgions lie off the direct route, yet they may become the arena of serious contention. The text cf the Treaty of July 3rd, 1916, betv/een Russia and Japan was published in the Izvestiya of December 19th, 1917.     It was already understood by the Russkoye Slovo of June 22/July 5, 1916, that under this Treaty, (1) The subjects of the Powers making the agreement enjoy full liberty to live and carry on their business in Siberia, and in the Japanese and Russian spheres of influence in Mongolia and Manchuria;    (2) Navigation on the River Sungari which is a privilege of the Russians, Is to be equally free to the Japanese too;    (3) Part of the Eastern Chinese Railway between Sungari and   Kuanchen-tsi is to be handed o/ver to Japan.   Soon after the conclusion of that Treaty Mr Sazonoff fell.   Many reasons for this were current at the time - the Minister&apos;s attitude on Polish affairs, his participation in the movement that ended in the request to the Emperor to desist from active leadership in the field, etc.     Mr KouIUrtizine, the President of the Council of the Empire, told the writer that the real..reason was something very different and directly connected with the Russo-Japanese- Treaty.
Mr Sazonoff felt very strongly that something had to he done to ingratiate the Russians with the Japanese in return for their assistance with munitions, as also to attempt tc lighten the pressure from that quarter of which he was conscious.   According! he drew up a treaty to which he got the Emperor&apos;s consent under pressure.    Mr Koulomzine stated that the Emperor, on further reflection, considered that too much had been given away in the secret clauses cf the Treaty (which was apparently the Japanese point cf vie?/, judged by the reception accorded to their Envoy -&apos;n his return to Japan), and that in consequence Mr Sazonoff was dismissed-There were about 1^ million Russians in these provinces in 1912 and three Russian cities cf mere than 50,000 inhabitants (Vladivostok, 85,000:   Blagcvyestchensk, 64,000;    and Tchita 74,000).&apos;   The Amur and Ussuri Cossacks number together about 40,0 There are, however, also very considerable Asiatic colonial elements, in particular Chinese (possibly 20% of the total population) whose presence accentuates the racial rivalries.(3) The Steppe Country.  - The conquest of this particular area dates from the 10th century, but it is only since the final subjugation of Turkestan, vhich may be said to have taken place when the Russians reached Pamir in 1895, that its possession was firmly secured.   The present statistics of population show that the natives who belong chiefly to the nomadic Turkic races of comparatively strong fe &amp;fea-l organisation still predominate numerically over the Russians, forming        to- the Russian 45$. Economically the Steppe cojmtry is a continuation of South East Russia and Southern Siberia, while its native question connects it with Russian Turkestan.
14.3.18.Question of Japanese Intervention,,It is probable that in case of intervention by the Japanese, they will meet with little hostility open or overt in Manchuria, while any activities in the Far East districts could not be very successfully resisted, even if there were a definite desire to do so on the part of the Russian population.    In Trans Baikalia they would have sympathisers in the Buriat people, but v;est of Irkutsk the pressure of the denser Sibiriak population is bound to make itself felt.    It is, therefore, very difficult to suppose that the Japanese would exert any active influence West of that town, owing to the distance involved and other complications.   At that point, however, they could offer a most effective rallying ground for the patriotic and order-loving elements in the Sibiriak population, as a result of which their resistance to the Germans could be stiffened. . It would seem only a matter of ordinary precaution, however, that any Japanese action should be accompanied by Allied representatives, for there is no doubt that there is more active fear and dislike cf the Japanese amongst the Russian population than of any other nationality except the Germans.    This fear Involves an active distrust.    It is, perhaps, useful to recollect that the large mission accompanying the Japanese Envoy to Petrograd in the summer of 1916 broke up after its work was done, and distributed itself over different parts of Russia to study the economic situation etc., and paid particular attention to conditions in Siberia on the homeward journey.(A second Memorandum will f^llew immediately dealing with political developments in Siberia before and after the Revolution).
