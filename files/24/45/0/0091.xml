OH   GERMANY     XLIII.V/e have two fresh German official pronouncements on the &quot;peace1, with Russia and. the new frontier States and on the situation which the presumed Eastern settlement leaves to be dealt with, particularly .on the Fest. .  The first Is HertlingJ s speech of March 18th to the Reichstag on the first reading of the Russian Peace Treaty which had just passed the Federal Council,     Count Hertling did not beat about the bush in dealing with Germany1s proceedings.     He represented the break-up of Western Russia as having taken place on lines &quot;corresponding to thesituation and the tendencies of the Kultur&quot; of these regions. He thus intended to convey that -duly authorised representatives of Ukrainia, Lithuania, Courland, Livonia and Esthonia had express^ the determination of these countries to separate themselves from Russia and to &quot;lean upon the German Empire&quot;.     Courland had gone farthest and the Landesrath of Courland,?;a body which is recognized as competent,t: expressed the desire for &quot;military; economic and political connection with. Germany&quot;.     The Chancellor-; following the lines of the Emperor William&apos;s reply to the offer of the Ducal Grown, by the same body, had &quot;thankfully and joyfully&quot; taken cognizance of the desire cf the Landesrath, but had reserved his decision as to the &quot;political form&quot; to be adopted until all the competent factors on both sides have dec&amp;ed en their future attitude In this connection.
As regards Lithuania, (the very frontiers of which have not as yet been even suggested) he was expecting a deputation from the Lithuanian National Council in the course of the next few days to announce anew their decision of last year in favour of &quot;close union with the German Empire in economic and military respects&quot;.Livonia and &quot;sthonia were on a somewhat different footing as being beyond the line drawn :&apos;.or the future western frontier of Russia.   Meanwhile Germany is to police them(Art.6 of the Peace Treaty with Russia) and the Chancellor hopes that they, too, will ultimately&quot;place themselves in close and friendly-relationship with the Empire, but in such a way as will not exclude peaceable and friendly relations with Russia&quot;The new State of Poland again is reminded bv the Chancellor that it owes its originrto the proclamation by tie German and    &apos; Austrian Emperors of November 5; 1916. -   &quot;It follows that the further shaping of this new State can only take place on the basis of joint negotiations between Germany and Austria-Hiin^ary on the one side and Poland on the other1&apos;.     Hertling does not yet venture to speak in the case of Poland of &quot;a close union with Germany in economic and military respects&quot;.     The recollection of the German failure to raise a Polish Army under German auspices doubtless acted as a deterrent.     But it is evident that any impending Austro-German &quot;negotiations&quot; with Poland would be as one-sided as were those of Brest-Litovsk. One thing Kertlinp; carefully reserves under an innocent-looking phrase.     Germany in her dealings with Poland is to &quot;safeguard her own interests1&apos;.     This undoubtledly refers to the annexations which the German military authorities demand -with a view to a &quot;scientific frontier&quot;.Kertling said nothing about Finland, but the omission was rectified by the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Baron von clem Bussche, who stated that Finland, as a portion of the former
Russian Empire, had been involved in the w r with Geri.i-.ui&quot; a-ainst her will.     The peace negotiations with Finland had been conducted in Berlin and &quot;here too our interests had been preserved in a thoroughly advantageous manner by our negotiations and a series of improvements had been introduced ae compared with the former state of affairs.&quot;     Among these improvements is doubtless to be reckoned the control which Article I of the Treaty r-ives to Germany over Finnish forei-n policy, inasmuch as Finland may not grant to any third Power a 1 servitude1 over its territory without a previous understanding with Germany.     This is prolably intended to apply to commercial concessions and also to the case of the Aaland Islands.2. The German Under Secretary does not appear to have made any specific reference to the Aaland Islands.     Tbe North German Gazette of March 8th (nol23) supplies the omission and discusses the question of the Aaland Islands with reference to the Treaty of Paris of 1856, the Agreement of 1908 which guaranteed to the riparian States of the Baltic the   territorial status nip of their possessions, and finally Russia&apos;s occupation of the Islands with the consent of the  Western Powers. -   The Treaty of Peace with Russia (Article VI) deals with this subject and provides that &quot;with regard to the permanent non-fortification of these islands as well as with regard to their treatment in other respects, military and maritime, a special Convention is to be concluded between Germany, Russia, Finland and Sweden&quot;.     The North German Gazette adds that the Aaland Islands are to be no lonrer any concern of the &quot;estern Powers.5.     The second official pronouncement was that of Kindenburg and Ludendorff to the Press.     Kindenburg seems to have found it necessary to defend Germany against the charge of having conducted a policy of force in her peace negotiations with Russia. Under the influence of the Revolution Russia fell to pieces. V/as Germany to wait until enemy propaganda had succeeded in
welding the particles together again ?       ith Ukrainia and Finland Germany came to an understanding when Russia failed to do so.     what happens to the others is their own concern and a matter of indifference to Germany (sic)     One thing was clear; they could not lean on Ruscia, and consequently they must lean on Germany.     But frontier guarantees must be exacted.     Germany would extend her frontiers eastwards, not from -Teed of conquest, but to make any repetition of thet invasion oi East Prussia at the beginning of this war impossible.4,     when we come to ask what reception is -riven to these views of Ilertling, Hindenburg and Ludendorff by the mass of the German people it is difficult to find a trustworthy answer.     The balance of evidence tends to show that what the gre..t majority ar-lently-desire is the earliest possible end of the war. .  But there is naturally great divergence of opinion as to the best method of securing it.     As is only natural, the words of the Emperor and the Generals about the Eas&apos;tern peace having been secured by the &quot;German sword&quot; find a wide echo ;    and it may safely be asserted that, even amonr the masses, there are many who are willing to give &quot;the German sword&quot; another trial on the   estern front.     If only an early peace can be secured, it will not be rejected by German public opinion because it was obtained by fight -ing.     What popular opinion protests against is the screwing up of peace terms by the Pan-Germans and the  reat industrialists, since it is now quite clear that the   estern Powers will fight to the last gasp against such terms *     It is also argued that the nature of the Eastern Peace and the methods by which it has been secured are bound &quot;to act as an incitement to the &apos;.. estern Powers to re-double their efforts in order to escape a fate like that of Russia.5,     It is mainly in the li;,ht of these considerations that the movement of impatience and dissatisfaction among the Majority (&quot;tame1&quot;&apos;) Socialists in the Reichstag ought to be regarded.
David is one of the ablest intellects among the followers of Soheidemann, and if parliamentary criticism counted for much at the moment his speech in the Reichstag last Monday would be very significant.     Hertling had just been boasting that the treaty with Russia contained &quot;no conditions whatever that were dishonour-ing to Russia, no mention of oppressive war indemnities and no forcible appropriation of Russian territory.&quot;David replied that the Brest-Litovsk peace was not a peace by understanding but &quot;an unvarnished peace by force&quot;.     Germanyrs diplomatists had capitulated to the representatives of the purely militarist idea of might.     This peace had evoked dissatisfaction among the widest circles of the German nation and had shaken confidence in the honesty of Germany&apos;s policy.   It could hot be reconciled with the repeated declarations of the Chancellor on the right of peoples to self-determination.     The German demand was that &quot;the righ/i^f the frontier peoples to self-determination should be regarded in the sense of severance from Russia&quot;   The Militarist party wanted to bottle up the Poles in the East and to carry out big annexations and dismemberment in the T/est under the watchword of military security.     Poland justly desired &quot;a window towards Russia&quot;.     What the Chancellor had said about the desires of Lithuania did not correspond with the facts, since mistrust of Germany had recently manifested itself in Lithuania.     The military party, which wanted to make Lithuania not independent but a Junker military colony lording it over a submissive population of Lithuanian peasants, would not permit the Lithuanian Delegation to come to Berlin.     The National Council of Courland had no right to speak on behalf of the Lettish population and the whole &quot;new orientation&quot; in Courland was the result of an arrangement bet?/een the Prussian Junkers and. the Baltic Barons.     In Finland the mass of the population would be enraged at German interference. In a word they were risking the sharpest antagonism to public feeling all along the line and &quot;the whole Eastern region will be converted into a smouldering furnace&quot;.
6.     David!s is not the only i:tame&quot; Socialist protest.     In the Frankfurter Volksstimme Hermann Uendel. also a prominent Majority Socialist Deputy, regards the situation as so grave that he thinks the Socialists ought to refuse to vote any more war credits. Nothing could, conceal the fact that the Socialist peace policy had        met with complete disaster.     They had desired a lasting peace by understanding.     What they had got in the East was a peace based on force which only meant a truce ushering in a period of renewed armaments.     The Reichstag Peace Resolution of July 19t had become a mere &quot;scrap of paper&quot;.     German troops v^ere being used in Finland to beat down the Revolution -&quot;a glorious task.&apos;&quot; 7.     If Majority Socialist protests of this kind had been uttered last summer the Government would have trembled, at them.     But the whole situation has undergone a fundamental change.     There has been first of all the exhibition of Bolshevist incapacity and anarchy and its terrible results for Russia.     The backbone of the German Social Democracy, the Trade Unions, is composed of fairly sensible working-men, not unlike the elite of the English working-classes. Their socialist theories do not blind them to the claims of their own material interests, and they do not desire to transplant Bolshevism to Germany or to bolster it up   in Russia.     Peace may have been won by the sword in the East, but it has not recently cost many German lives there.     The advance into Esthonia, the Ukraine, even to Odessa has been a kind of military promenade, and at the end of it there is some prospect of obtaining food-stuffs and other supplies.. - Any peace is better than no peace.     It remains to be seen whether the Western Powers will stand against the German offensive.   If the event shows that the Eastern Peace has really stiffened their resistance it will then be time enough to protest against the policy of Hertling and the FieIdmarshals.Another thing that has taken the pith out of Socialist opposition is the failure of the Strike and the absence of sympathy with it in the Trade Unions.     The Government does not now fear Reichstag
or newspaper opposition so long as it is confined to the Left, because they believe that there is no longer any real menace of industrial revolt behind it.     Erzberger himself may try to rally Catholic malcontents, but the discipline of the vast majority of the Centre Party is secured by the mere fact of IIertling&apos;s Chancellorship.     The Government has the reform of the Prussian Franchise Bill, the Labour Chamber&apos;s Bill and the abolition of the Coalition paragraph (153) as baits to dangle before the leaders of the working-clanses.     They can safely adhere to their promises about the Franchise, because (a) there will be no general election in Prussia (or in the Empire) before the end of the v.ar* , Nothing consequently need be feared from w,.r-weariness showing itself at the poll, (b) It has been calculated out that the extent of the democratization of the Prussian Chamber under the proposed new franchise would not really be alarming, while the guarantees contained in the Upper House Bill and the Bill affecting Finance would in any case prevent revolutionary &quot;parliamentarism&quot; 8.     Hertling was thus able to reply with complete- equanimity on February 26th to the Conservatives who had taken umbrage at the Radical &quot;party speech&quot; (as they called it) with which the Vice-Chancellor Payer had made his debut as a member of the Governs ment.     The speech was, no doubt, the first utterance of such an advanced character that has been delivered from the Government bench in the Reichstag, and to readers unacquainted with   the present situation in Germany it might appear to mark an epoch . The German Government really knows how far it can safely let reform and the advocates of reform go.A certin counterweight to the propaganda of the Pan-Germans, the Fatherland Party and the militarists is required in ordir to enable Germany to angle for an advantageous western Peace such as would secure for her a well-rounded colonial Empire and freedom to trade with the world.     The semblance of a progressive policy at home is required for this end, and in Germany it is comparatively Cosy to feign political progress&quot;.
^ *m     QIt is to be noted that the recent election at - Mederbarnim, a densely-populated working-class suburb in the North of Berlin, resulted in a large majority on the first ballot for the &quot;tame&quot; Socialist candidate, although the late member, Stadthagen, Was an Independent.     A second ballot is required as the &quot;tame&quot; Socialist did not obtain a majority of all the votes polled, but the votes cast for other parties will certainly go to the &quot;tame&quot; Socialist at the second ballot and secure his election.
