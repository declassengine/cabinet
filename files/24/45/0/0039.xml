Jo DOCUMENT IS THE PROPSRJPY^OF HIS BglgAIKIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)0 E   IP,- 3939,W AH     CAB I II E T.IKTELLIGEHOE BUREAU OP TEC DEPARTMENT 01* IHgQRHATIQg. Mjg^orandum by General Smuts. (Prepared In&apos;accordance with War Cabinet 359, Minute 7),The $ar Cabinet referred to me the question whether the Intelligence Bureau hitherto existing under Colonel Buchan!b Information Department should in future come under the newly constituted Ministry of Information or should, in accordance with a previous V/ar Cabinet decision, come under the Foreign Office.   After hearing the evidence of the two Departments I came to the conclusica that it would be wrong to deprive the new Ministry of the Intelli-gence functions which seemed to me necessary for the proper execution of its duties, and I ruled that the existing Intelligence Bureau should continue with tho new Ministry which has taken the place of the Information Department under which the Bureau had hitherto worked^     This ruling was accepted by the parties.The Foreign Offieo represented, however, that       Intelligence Department of its own, which could direct, sift, and co-ordinate all the important political information, much of it of a very secret character, coming to it not only from its own representatives but also the war Office and Admiralty, was   essential to a proper discharge of its duties, and I accordingly decided that the Foreign Office should constitute such a department which would be responsible for this and for supplying the Cabinet with intelligence reports based on all the information coining to its,It was admitted that the Ministry of Information was entitled to receive very full information, not only from the Foreign Office but also from the Admiralty and the War Office, in order that It might have the fullest material for its propaganda work.     In view sf the secret character of much of their intelligence, the Admiralty and the War Office expressed their strong preference for supplying all their political information to the Foreign Office instead ef direct to the Ministry of Information, the ^oroign Office under-taking to supply the Ministry of Information with all such information as was useful for propaganda and was not of toe confidential or secret a nature.     The Ministry of Information px*e erre&amp; to obtain its information direct from the Admiralty and War Office instead of through the intermediation of the Foreign Officef but agreed to accept that intermediation as a provisional arrangement with the idea of again raising the question later on.After these decisions had been taken the principal officials of the Intelligence Bureau resigned, presumably because they wished to remain responsible under the Foreign Office for writing the Intelligence reports for the Cabinet.     Lord Beavsrbrook aske* for &amp; ruling from me that those gentlemen should not be engaged by the Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office after their resignation from his Department,     I declined to lay down this ruling as they were not civil servants but independent experts voluntarily serving the country in war time, and as the -foreign Office represented (no doubt with perfect truth) that their expert * services
services could not be spared, and if they did noli work tuatey tho Ministry of Information, they should he allowed to work under the Foreign Office.Various expedients tried &quot;by me to overcome the difficulty have failed, and I can only report the situation to the Cabinet for a definite decision on tho pointsLord Beaverbrook will probably also raise the other question whether he is not entitled to be supplied with Admiralty and War Office Lntolligence direct instead of through the channel of the Foreign Office *A way out of the difficulty iu for the Cabinet to decide that the intelligence Bureau should remain with the Ministry of Information, and that its functions should remain exactly asi they have been hithertos     In that case the Cabinet will get two gets of Intelligence reports - one from the Foreign Office and the other from tho i&amp;nistry of Information.     In spite of this multiplication of the papers coming before the Cabinet, I advise that this solution be adopted.(Initialled).
