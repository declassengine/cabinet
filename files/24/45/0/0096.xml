OF FOODWith reference to Mr. Austen Chamberlain&apos; s note(Paper G.T. 3979), I should like to point out that the suggestion that the Board of Trade allocate cargoes without consultation with the Meat &amp; Fats jtocutive is based on a misapprehension of their usual practice. That Uxeoutive is fully acquaintad with the terms of the existing Conventions between tho British Government and the French and Italian Governments for the supply of frozen meat to the Allied Armies and the total allo-cations each month.are reported to them by the Board. The day to day *allocation of ships from South America is done by the Board of Trade and all questions relating to the allocation of ships to Australia, New Zealand and Morth Atlantic are dealt&apos;with by a Committee on which the ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Food and Board of Trade have representatives.So far from the Meat and Fats iSxecutivs not being consulted in the division of North American meat the present dispute ha3 arisen out of an application to them through the ministry of Food by the Board of Trade for the allocation of three such cargoes for the use of the French and Italian Armies.Representatives of tho Board of Trade have attended meetings of the Meat &amp; Fats Executive when tiie general allocation of ftorth American meat was under discussion and the officials of ths Board and of that I&amp;ecutive keep in close touch.&apos;Board of Tradej22nd March, -1918.A.
