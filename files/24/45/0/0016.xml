T. 3916 &quot; &quot;M^OiUTOM BY LORD BBAVJIRBROOZOwing to the genor-dl oh;sngo in the political situation in the Far East, I am impressed with ths urgent necessity of sending to Japan a political and commercial mission to strengthen British pres-* tigo there5 to keep the Japanese in close touch with British sentiment and to counteract a feeling which certainly exists in the minds of certain Ministers and other highly-placed persons in th* Japanese commonsealtht that things are going ill with the Allies in general and with Great Britain in particular?Ths importance of the setter in apparent from isany communications received fros the British Ambassador si 1&apos;okyo, and more Immediately from telegrcms, such ea those of January 26th and February 19th, copies of which are attached (Annex I &amp; Annex II).   Hatters may hav$ changed since that tim as the situation has developed, hut they will not have changed for the better.I understand that it is proposed that a small mission should shortly leave this country under General Sir Arthur Pagot to take to the Bmperor of Japan the baton of Pield-Marshal, to which distinction he has lately been appointed by ths E.ing*    I would suggest that this mission should be made of greater siss and import&amp;nos; its Head should he a person of distinction, possibly a member of the Royal Family, or at any rate a leader of political eminence, and that it should contain at least one diplomat and either one or two business men of the first rank:; also one or more mm versed in the difficult work of propaganda.    $he. business and propagandist members might be instructed to re&amp;aia for a month or more at the Embassy at To&amp;yo, thus giving the mission a more permanent ch&amp;r-aoter than if it merely took out the baton and imodiately returned. As it would probably be very difficult to find in this country a diplomat who oou2$ be spared, it would perhaps be possible to detach somebody from the Legation at Peking^Our existing propaganda organisation in Japa&amp; has lately been investigated, and a representative of. my Ministry is expected baofe from Japan within the. next fev* weeks:   but I am oonvinoed that the ordinary machinery of propaganda would be inadequate to deal with the serious loss of prestige from which this country is suffer-lag in the Far East, and that a mission; of ths kind which I have described is really necessary to counteract a growing tendency la our disfavour*I recommend that the foreign Office should bo requested to consult immediately by cubls the Ambassador at &apos;Jokyo as to the mission and its personnel.(Signed) BeaverbrookMinistry of Information, March 15th, 1918.

England or her history if&apos; he thought that she would ever yield to any wave of national depression: all her greatest historical achievements had been wo n in apparently desperate situations and she was not too exhausted to assert herself non than In past &amp;   As regards America 3 aron must understand that it was whole American people and not merely President of the   Republic who had embarked upon present war with determination to achieve Its avowed objects no matter how long it might talco to secure this.To this. Baron replied by throwing up Ms hands (group undecipherable) ing that in that case war might last thirty years.United States Ambassador assumes that with this conversations will come to an end..s passage of armsMTMX II,Decypher of telegram from Sir   Cft Greene (Tckio) to Foreign Office, February 19th 1918*No, 154.u c f. t * e * s o a t c e * 6 * *Private and SecreteMy telegrams (? January 11th) and January 18th.As a.resuit of further conversations which United States Ambassador hi had with same person as well as with Minister for Foreign  Affairs his impression has been confirmedthat there Is in Government circles here a growing distrust of England1s staying qualities.   It is widely believed:-1. -That England is seriously embarrassed (a) by labour difficultiesat home (b) by increasing bitterness in Ireland (c) by growingdiscontent In India,2, It is- believed Lord Lansdowne*s recent utterances are significant and represent a prevalent opinion throughout the country. 3. It is believed fa) that England Is facing &quot;exhaustion&quot; (b) that submarine C?campaign,omitted) Is seriously curtailing her food supp^l (e) that she has no further man power to draw upon and (d) that (*?herj spirit of determination Is wavering. Having regard to above opinions which, would appear to be not so much ir of German propaganda as of misleading (?lnformation) I suggest seme acti*
D 0AMiBX II (Cont.)s desirable to counteract these misapprehensions if you should think it to instruct me (?to take up) various points raised aboTC with apaneae Government.     I am of course (?more than) ready to do so (?to he)  best of) my ability but having regard to my long absence from n/fjancl it is difficult for me to judge how much if any foundation there a^Pbe for any of opinions referred and I am hardly in a position to hock or correct them from up-to-date information. (?In the circumstances) t has occurred to me that you might perhaps approve of my discussing hole matter with   Colonel Wedgewood (on his)    (?arrival) here February th and trusting him confidentially (closely) explaini?ing) the real ituation in informal private conversation with Minister for Foreign :fairs to whom I have already arranged to present him.     It seems to me lat coming, as Colonel   ftedgewood will, direct from England he can jscribe conditions there from first hand knowledge and that in his d&amp;lity of member of Parliament who has also seen service at the front and nfi&amp;ential emissary of His Majesty1 s Government his words should carry eight.   As a further suggestion I should have liked to propose to you hat  Colonel fte&amp;gewcod should be authorised to use his discretion as issuing a statement to the Press inform of an interview covering aneral conditions in England which could be circulated to all English ad vernacular newspapers simultaneously but I hesitate to do so having egard to (?cypher) telegram Ho, 15 Secret paragraph 4.In the event of any proposals above submitted meeting with your pproval it would be very useful if you could supply me with whatever nf email on you may consider&amp;esirable to enable me to discuss various ints tabulated in paragraph 1 of this telegram cither personally with inister for   Foreign A ffairs or through Colonel Vr&quot;edgewood*A1MEX III.Hote by Lord Hardlnge.BALFOUR.II quite agree with Lord Beaverbrook that as much eclat as possible should, e given to the Mission that is to proceed to Tokio to present a   Field-arshal&apos;s baton to the Emperor of Japan.   If it wero possible to depute a loyal Prince to go as the Head of the Mission it would be by far the best lolution,     But if this is not possiblef then it seems to me that the ission must necessarily have at its head an officer of the highest military wit that can be found.   The ostensible object of the Mission being purely iilitary, it could hardly ho appropriately carried out by anybody else of iowever great political eminence.   But there wsuld be no objection to the strengthening of the   Staff of the Mission by any elements that might be jfonsidered desirable,   and such a course might even prove to be of &quot;distinct 1 vantage,As far as the Foreign Office i3 concerned there would be no difficulty Jn detaching Mr. A lston,   Councillor of H.M.Legation in Pekin, as ^moorary member of the Mission.(Intld) H.13 March, 1918.1 agree.A.J.B,
