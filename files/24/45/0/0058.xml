N./9954.WAR   CABINETTransfer of the Control of Refrigerated Meat to theMinistry of I?ood.Memorandum shy the Secretary of State for War.I must offer the strongest protest against Lord Rhondda&apos;s memorandum, of March 8th (G.T. 3149)  in respect of his recommendation that the supply of imported, meat for the Army -should be under his control.Lord Rhondda brought this matter before the War Cabinet last October and December,  (War Cabinet 256 (13)  and 297 (2) when it was referred to   Lord Milner and Mr. Barnes to investigate. They gave a decision (G.T.2997)  in favour of the War Office&apos;s contention that this Department must be allowed to control, in conjunction with the Board of Trade, meat which is supplied from the Argentine, Australia and elsewhere under contracts made at the commencement of the war.1 recognise that it may - and probably will - be necessary to reduce the amount of rations given to the Army both at home and abroad, but that is a matter which can bd dealt with by the Army Council at the direction of the War Cabinet,  and does not entail the change of control which Lord Rhondda suggests. Nobody can deny that the supply of food to the Army has been carried out extremely well by the Q.M.G.I attach a note which deals with the matter more indetail.DERBY.16th March,  1918...
Transfer ef the Control of Refrigerated Meat to the Ministry of Food.Memorandum by the Army Counoil.1. The only meat not at present under the control of thePood Ministry is that supplied exclusively for Army purpcses. Any meat acquired under the existing contracts (whioh run for the period of the war) found unsuitable for Army requirements is already oontrelled and allocated by the Pood Controller. No meat held by the Beard of Trade far the War Department $an, under any oiroumstanoGs, be available for supplementing civilian meat rations except at the risk ef enoroaohing upon Army Supplies.2. As reoently as 13th December last the War Cabinetdeputed Lord Milner and Mr. Barnes to adjudicate on this very question, and as a result of their investigation, and after hearing both sides, they found that the Army was not in competition with the Pood Controller and advised that n* ahango in procedure was neoessary.In their adjudication G.T.2997, dated 13.12.17. L*rd Milner and Mr. Barnes delivered themselves as follows:    &quot;The governing factor in this oonneotiwa is that contracts have already been arranged on behalf of the War Office f^r the purchase of meat in Australasia and South America for the period of the war, and for three months after.   All danger of competition is, therefore, already prealuded in this area.   The only market in whioh competition could conaeivably arise is that of North Amerioa.   The Secretary of State for War., however, has stated that he is willing t  undertake that no purohases should be made in this market except through the Pood Controller&quot;.It will, therefore, be seeh that unless it is the Intention of the Food Controller to utilize Army Supplies fer the Civil population, he has nething ti gain by the changes he now proposes. -ge ln addition te the expressed opinions of Lord Milnerand Mr,- Barnes, the Prime Minister himself has stated that he will not oountenanoe any interference with the Army Supplies,4 With these preliminary remarks we fan now proceed toexamine the reasons put forward by the Pood Controller for the changes he recommends:-(a) The statement in the first paragraph has already been dealt with.(b) The statement contained in the second paragraph is entirely misleading:-     The facts are as follow:Representatives of the Beard of Trade were recently invited te attend a meeting of the Inter-Allied Meat and Pats Sxeoutive Committee at whioh the allocation of meat purchased by the Food Controller in North Amerioa ^as discussed.It
^ iL 4) 4(It was decided that Captain Brook, the Chairman, should ascertain full details of the needs of each country ana recommend an allocation, the American representative having expressed the opinion that all the Allies should share in the meat available from this source.     The recommendations of the He at-and-Fat s Executive Committee has not yet &quot;been communicated to the Board of Trade, but in the meantime the Ministry of Shipping being desirous of settling ports of discharge before the ships which were en route to America were actually loaded. The Board of Trade suggested to the Food Controller the names of 3 ships which they considered were suitable - 2 for France and 1 for Italy, and enquired whether the Food Controller agreed. The reply was thai; the Food Controller did not agree that France needed meat, and that if these boats were diverted to France and Italy, it would jeopardize his rationing scheme.     No action to divert these ships to the Allies has therefore been taken by the Board and the boats are coming to the United KingdomFrom the above it will be seen that so far from the Food Controller not having been consulted in this matter, he lias actually decided the question in his own favour even to the extent of over-riding the decision of the Inter-Allied Meat and Fats Executive Commiittee, who had definitely recommended that this meat should be shared by the Allies, and on whose allocation the Board of Trade was merely waiting to take the necessary action.       Before leaving this paragraph it may be as well to allude to the Food Controllers statement that the Board of Trade&apos;s action was the result of &quot;Agreements made under totally different circumstances 2 years ago&quot;.     With reference to this it should be observed that this so-called agreement is a Convention existing between the various Allied Governments, which obviously cannot be varied without their consent-.     If either the French or the Italian Governments would agree to their stipulated quotas being reduced, it would undoubtedly relieve the situation.     But everything points to the reverse. The Italian Government keep pressing for more, and the French Government are urging that their&apos; arrears which stand today some 70,000&quot;tons should be made up.(c)   The statement in the third paragraph &quot;is also entirely inaccurate.     The Convention with the Italian Government provides for an average monthly supply of 10,000 tons.Allotments to Italy under the Convention since the beginning of this year are as followsJanuary 12,343 tons.February 7,224 tons.March 5,09 2 t on s(estimate)24,659 tonswhich gives an average of 8,219 tons per month only.Therefore the existing agreement with that country has not actually been fulfilled.U)
a J) 9(d) The statement in paragraph 4 is again entirely inaccurate as shown in (h) above,     in accordance with the termsof Lord Hilner1s adjudication under which North American purchases were handed over to the Food Controller, the Board of Trade have now for the first time had occasion to consult the Food Ministry   with regard to allocation of meat from this source, and are met with a refusal to allow any portion of the ITortheAmerican meat to be used for Allied Army purposes.(e) As regards para. 5 it has already been stated that distribution of army supplies is controlled by existing Conventions between the respective Governments,     As shown in (b) above it is the Food Controller himself who has over-ridden the arrangements upon which &quot;the Americans have so strongly insisted&quot; and claims that he alone is entitled to determine who shall benefit by meat imports from North America.      .hen it was decided by Lord Milner that the Ministry of Food should undertake the purchaseof all available North American meat,  it was clearly understood and agreed their operations were to cover both Army and Civilian supplies, but that in all cases army requirements v/ere to have precedence,     It therefore follows that,  if the Ministry of Food persists in their refusal to permit any North American shipments to be used for Army purposes, this very essential source of supply is lost to the Allied Armies.(f) v/ith reference to the 5th paragre,ph the Food Controller is asking for what has already been conceded, to him,  so far as purchases in North America are concerned.     While with regard to all other meat he is claiming to upsetthe recent decision of the bar Cabinet,(g) With regard to para. 7, the above remarks it is submitted in themselves provide full justification for the proper anxiety of the Army Council alluded to in para.7.by the Food Controller.      It has been shown thet just as in the former attempt to gain control of Army Supplies in December last,  the reasons put for-vard for the change now advocated are based wholly on mis-staternent of f&apos;-cts, and while the Army Council do not suggest that these mis-statements arise from any other causes than inadvertence,  they are of opinion that they disclose a want of knowledge which entirely precludes the Council from reposing any confidence in the operat.1 ons of the Ministry of Food so far as supply to the Army is concerned. Nor for the reasons given by the Food Controller in para.1 of his memorandum can they accept the assurance that adequate reserves for the Army would ever be forthcoming if the changes took place.     As for the statement that the system   under which beacon,  cereals.,  sugar ana other foodstuffs are shipped is working well,   it will be apparent to anyone conversant with the subject, that the problem of the supply cf refrigerated, meat has very little, if anything,  in common with that of the supply of other commodities,But apart from this it should be observed that in the case of cereals and sugar these commodities have been ably handled by Special Royal Commissions, which are in no sense the creation of the Ministry of Food v;ho exercise only a nominal control,     Moreover it should be remembered that the Army quota of these commodities is so comparatively snail as to be very easily satisfied.      As regards bacon and cheese which are solely under the control cf the Food Ministry,  the continued supply ofthese
9 9 4kt ki &quot;ithese commodities is not without serious anxiety to the Army Council.To summarize:-Para.  1.       The Pood Controller has already got control of all meat not required for Army purposes,Para. 2.       It has already &quot;been decided by the War Cabinet as recently as December last that   no change was necessary.      The -^ood Controller has nothing to gain by his proposals.Para. 3.       See Paragraph 2.Para. 4.(b)  The Pood Controller&apos;s statement is entirely misleading.  -(o)  The Pood Controller&apos;s statement is entirely inaccurate .(d) The Pood Controllers statement does not represent the facts.(e) The Food Controller has himself overridden the conditions on the observance of which he so strongly insists:    and in direct violation of the agreed principle of Army   Priority now claims the exclusive  right to utilize all his purchases as he wishes regardless of Army requirements.(f) See (e)  above and also paragraph 1.(g) In spite of the Food Controllers appreciation of the Army Council&apos;s anxiety that the Meat supply should not be endangered,  that anxiety is not lessened in view of the many inaccuracies apparent in his Memorandum..in all the circumstances therefore the Army Council must record their definite opinion that it is impossible for them to acquiesce in the Food Controller&apos;s proposals.
