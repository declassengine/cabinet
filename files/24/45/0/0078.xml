Government by Ocni:i:ttcr.y is a vary indifferent system, and must be kept witiiin the narrowest limits. Something of the. kind, however, seems necessary: (a)   When the work to be done involves the constant co-operation of two or more Departments; ana (b) When the establisliment of a Comjaittee of inferior status saves the time of the War Cabinet,From both these points of view there is much to be said for   the establishment of a Conrnittee dealing with the middle East and contiguous regions, in which the War Office, the India Office, the Admiralty, and the Foreign Office may make their voices heard,I think, on the whole, there is a balance of argument in favour of the Chairman being drawn from none of these Departments; and though I understand that, in succession to Lord idrey, I count for purposes of this kind as a. Cabinet Minister, I do not propose to put in any claim to the doubtful joys of presiding over the new Eastern Committee,Cf course it is understood, that, where my own Department alone is concerned, it rests with me to determine whether the subject should be dealt with by this Office, or whether the case is one whichrequiresHis Britannic M?!**^k^ rv^Z7Zr&quot;&quot;T&quot;[THE EASTERN COI&amp;vilTTEE.

requires the outside help which the Eastern Gor/iiiittee may he able to supply.These general principles being premised, and. I presume accepted, I have no objection to the Constitution proposed by Lord CurzoncThe Russian Committee, however, may be dropped from the scheme;   it is a Departmental affair, and for the moment at least may be regarded as almost in abeyance.I would suggest, too, that we should not lay down the hard and fast rule that there should he two meetings a week.   I would propose one meeting, with power either for the Chairman or the Head of one of the Departments concerned to call another if necessity should arise.There is no harm, and perhaps much advantage,, in preparing the Agenda in advance; but to lay it down that the business must necessarily and always be taken in the order thus fixed seems to make our rules needlessly rigid0(Initialled)    AbJaBoForeign Office,15th Larch, 1918,
