A, who are under 30 years of agej and I note with satisfaction that the Minister of National Service is prepared to back the proposal.(2)   Whatever system may be adopted to determine the claims of the different departments to the men thus recalled. I must urge that the pressing needs of the Ministry of Food may.receive the fullest recognition.   The Headquarters&apos; staff of the Ministry, now numbers no less than 3;500.   The responsible posts are approximately 560, of which 466 or Bo% are filled by business men and only 6.6 or 11$ by Civil Servants of the Home &amp; Indian Services. On December 13th the War Cabinet decided that the claims of the Ministry of Food for staff should be treated as being of great urgency, and instructed the Secretary to communicate the decision to all the departments concerned (WfC, 297, Minute 5). In spite of this, as a result of some 15 applications for the loan of Civil Servants em-ployed in other departments, I have succeeded in securing only one.(3)    I submit that no Ministry has more vital interests in its charge at the present moment than the Ministry of Food and I be-lieve that none is in greater need of the assistance of trained and experienced Civil Servants. With the introduction of compulsory rationing the work of the Ministry has been nearly doubled and its efficiency is very seriously endangered by the lack of trained men with administrative experience. I therefore ask that the Minis+ry of Food may be given the first choice of the Civil Servants released from the Colours.RH0NDD.A,MINISTRY OF FOOD,13th March, 1918.
