:^miLMJm^mmMsm hw arbitration ao Aim.ISMZ^MmJ^XJ^ a. Borneo.My attention has been drawn to the effect upon the^o^itlon of the Conciliation and Arbitration Board for Government Jimploy-oes exercised by V/,C. 31?(hin. l), on Page 3, which is as ibOl/jwr&quot;All applications for %n increase in war advances, and wage disputes arising therefrom shall be referred for decision to the Hinistry of Labour,who may refer them to the Committee on Production,The Hinistry of Labour will have discretion to ask tho department concerned to carry on any necessary no-gcliations, hut the final decision will in all cases rest with the Kinistry of Labour&quot;.It was, of course, naves? intended that this Minute should have the effect of diminishing the power of the Conciliation and Arbitration Board for Government Employees;   the powers of that Board   er. claarly defined in the terms of reference which are as follows:-To daal by way of conciliation or arbitration with questions arising with regard to claims for increased remuneration (whether permanent or temporary owing tc war conditions) made by classes of employees of Government Departments, other than classes of employees who are en-gaged wholly or mainly by way of manual labour of a kind common to Government and other employment, and in res-pect of whom the Board arssatisfiod, on the certificate of the Government Department coneerned, that adequate means for the settlement of such questions have already been provided, or that changes of remuneration always follow the decision of the recognised machinery applica-ble to the district generally4PROVIDED THAT for the present and until experience has been gained of the working of the soheme, the Board shall not entertain applications for permanent increases of salary from the more highly paid classes of employees of any Government Department, namely, classes of officers with salaries of  500 or over or placed on scales of salary rising to  500 or over&quot;.Method of Procedure. - Any claim which may fall within the torms of reference shall be heard before the Board acting as a triplicate chairman, together with not more than three official representatives and not more than three representatives of the class of employees concerned or their associations, where such association exists. Pro-vidod that in all cases the employees concerned shall be at liberty to nominate as one of their representatives a person who is not a member of the class in question,
Such a person shall not, however, &quot;be a signatory to any agreement arrived at by conciliation.   The official reprs^ sentatives shall he appointed in cases where employees of only one Government-Department are concernedtwo by that Department and one by the Treasury.   In ether Oases thoy shall all be appointed by the Treasury.   In the first instance, the official representatives and the employees&apos; representatives shall endeavour to arrange the difference by mutual agreement, but should they fail to settle the matter by conciliation the case will be at $&quot;nee referred to the Board acting *e Arbitrators, who may Iall for further evidence if they desire and give such other directions as they may think necessary for the proper decision of the matters in dispute (W.C, 252.IIin.6&apos;).t should perhaps explain that the position of the Con-olliation and Arbitration Board for Government Employees is quite different to that of the Committee on Production.   The latter body draws its cases from ths Ministry of Labour, to whoa also its awards are intimated.   But the former receives claims from employees of any Government Department, and effeet is given to its awards by.instructions of the Treasury.At the present time, claims for the 12   bonus are &quot;being referred to the Conciliation and Arbitration Board and a direction is required as to how thsso claims should be dealt with.   In view of ths fact that when the lZj$ was initiated, men on an upstanding wage, (i.e.t receiving wages when away from work owing to illness, etc.) were excluded from its operation, I have m doubt that claims for the 12 $ bonus, made by Government employees who are in receipt of an upstanding wage or salary, should aot be accepted by the Conciliation and Arbitration Board, and a direction to this effect should, I think, Xw given by the \7ar Cabinet to the Chairman of the Board.(SGD) 0,JJ.B.2, \7hitehall Gardens. 19th. March, 1918.
