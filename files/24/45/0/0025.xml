Intelligence-- BureauDepartment of In or?sa-tionSECRETA.G.W./042WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   GERMANYXLII(March 14th 1918)The-reception-accorded in Germany to the terms of peace enforcecUupon Russia and Rumania and to the Treaties of Peace with the Ukraine and Finland socm$ finally to dispose of any possibility that the Reichstag Majority of July 19, 1917 might protest against the complete reversal of its Resolutions as accepted at the time by the Government,     The Majority Socialists profess&quot;to viow the^faits azc;cmp1is with soiwsrful-jres&amp;goatlcn j the Gatholic Centre, to jtuige--f^m^Eertllti^s^--speochss and the tone of its press,is frankly cynical.   The organs of the Majority Socialists call attention to the obvious fact that &quot;it is immensely difficult for tho^Sooialist Party in-a-victorious State to realise their ideal demands&quot; and they add: &quot;the peace with Russia did not turn out as we expected it:&apos;.The attention of the Socialist and Labour parties in the- countrir-of the Western Allies might well be devoted to the complete failure of the German Socialist opposition to a policy of conquest, territorial and economic annexation and boundless Imperial ambition in the East.     The&apos;suggestion made at the Inter-Allied &quot;Socialist Congress in Paris and London that international representatives of Labour should take part in the eventual Peace Conference has instructive light thrown upon it by the way in which^th&amp;jSerman Social Democrats are already lecturing their^oonnTades^ of the Allied countries.     Two subjects are from the outset ruled out. N o G erms n --G^^efx^icrr^ J^sj^TtoAlsace-Lorraine could live for twenty-four hours;   and the Central
Powers would&quot; simply laugh&apos;1 at   any suggestion that the Ausi.ro-Hungarian Empire should ho dissolved and that Cseohs,.. Slovaks and Jugo-Slavs should form, a&quot;free Union of DaraXblsh Siates!! The Socialists of   3hhe Allied countries are invited to consider whether it would not he better to abandon &quot;ideal demands n and to resign themselves to the conviction that &quot;a great part of the Socialistic work which is to contribute to a lasting peace will be achieved after the conclusion of that peace;:.   In the meantime they are warned that the programme of the Inter-allied Socialists r-y become a danger to peace, as the statesmen of the Allies may be inclined to consider it as n a kind of popular minimum programmei;. It would therefore from the German Socialist point of view be an advantage if the Inter-allied Socialists would declare that &quot;their conditions have only a relative value&quot;iFrom all thi3 it is apparent that if an International delegation of Socialists were to participate in the eventual Peace Congress, the proceedings would resolve themselves into long debates on general principles such as Trotsky tried to conduct at Brest-Litovsk, and that a shrewd and hard-grained negotiator,like Kuhlmann, would the more easily attain his objects.Not that there Is the slightest intention on the part of the German Government to let its Socialists, tame or wild, have any say in such high matters.     Their role Is to be solely that of preparing the ground, and they are to continue to- play a more of? less unconscious part in the German &quot;political offensive&quot;.     As one of the reports we have received puts it &quot;German-Austrian politics are now stage-managed&quot;.2.     Hertling has been put forward by the&quot; Germans as a moralist whose word is to be taken as his bond.     With KertHhg- as Chancellor, tho Allies^must^howlonger presume to question German honosty and sincerity.     In-^hetre^iJ^um^tanoes -theI ir  1
utterances of the leading organ of the Party which is politically closest to the Chancellor and tho Catholic Centre merit special attention.     The German!a, dealing with the case of Rumania and the Eastern Peace in general, says that there is in Germany &quot;no lack of sentimentalists who are inclined to think it wrong on the part of the Quadruple Alliance to take advantage of the embarrassing situation in which Rumania finds herself&quot;.     But if none of the Eastern Peace Treaties corresponds with the &quot;poetic viewsi: (sic) adopted hy the exponents of fine theories, the fault does not lie with the Quadruple Alliance.     General Hoffmann was quite right when at Brest-Litovsk he emphasized the fact that it had become necessary to apply compulsion to Russia.     If the Russians had shown goodwill it would have been possible for Germany to conclude &quot;the most beautiful and perfect peace&quot; with them.     The blunders of the Bolshevists based upon their fine theories made it necessary to treat them in the spirit of Goethe5s words in the Erlkbnig : &quot;And art thou unwilling, I then must use force1&quot;&apos;.(und bist du nicht willig So brauch&apos; ich Gewalt) There follows a defence of &quot;rectifications of frontier&quot;, which Scheidemann himself declared not to be inconsistent with &quot;peace by understanding&quot;.     As for the Bulgarian &quot;recovery&quot; of the Dobrudja from Rumania, it is really a case of &quot;disanncsation&quot; and a meet retribution for Rumaniafs policy of violence in 1912 and also in 1916 and 1917.     And so forth.Equally interesting is an attempt to deal with the argument of those Germans - and they are not confined to the Social Democrats -who object to annexations and territorial mutilations In the East because they are likely to create new enemies for Germany oh her Eastern frontiers.     Here the Socialist Right, which is represented
in the press by the Internatio&amp;aX-e^ Gorrospon-demz , an organ founded after the outbreak of war by those who might be describee- as the Socialist Imperialists, takes up the defence of the Government. It says that the opponents of the peace with Russia cannot have it both ways.     It cannot be asserted that the creation of independent States Is only a half-concealed form of annexation and at the same time that these new States will inevitably become enemies of Germany. These two views are described as mutually exclusive.     But surely the truth taught by history is that the establishment of new States whose frontiers are unsatisfactory and their political status uncertain is one of the surest methods of creating centres of chronic unrest with a constant search for alliances against the Power which ?.ntends to exercise a thinly-veiled political and economic control. Great Britain has had painful and instructive experiences in this regard.Another section of the German working-classes - those who belong to the so-called Christian Trade Unions, Catholic and Protestant,-is adjuring international Labour to keep off questions of inter-national politics altogether and, if it holds Conferences, to concern itself solely with Labour questions.     Here the German Government is to take the lead.     It&quot;has already taken in hand the international adjustment of social policy&quot;says Giesbert, the President of the Christian Trade Union of Metal-workers and Centre Deputy in the Reichstag for Essen,&quot; and a similar line can be followed in Peace Treaties&quot;.     He adds:&quot;If the International Congress (of Labour) gives its attention to social policy, that would certainly be more fruitful, and its prospects would be better than if it were to work for the weakening of Germany.&quot; 4.     The chief objections to the peace with Russia are to be found among the representatives of the great German. Industrialists-who still seem to fear that Gex*man^,9tateamen - may eventual ly content
themselves with having secured 921 outwardly splendid triumph in the East which would enable them to renounce the hopo of acquisitions in the   est. The eyes of these people are still fixed upon Briey and Longwy and they want at least an economic control in Belgium where German enterprise --ould inevitably ens\&apos;r the political domination of the country by Germany.     As the commercial and industrial rivals of England they also fear that she may be&quot;allowed&quot; to retain Mesopotamia, Palestine and the German Colonies.     As for the Russia of the future she has been fatally estranged and the dream of redressing the balance of power in favour of Germany by an alliance of the Central Powers with Russia is for ever shattered.     On this it may be remarked that a sudden volte-face by Germany in favour of a reasonable peace with the western Powers iv just conceivable, especially if and when German statesmen realise the invincible determination of England and America.     But at present there is absolutely no symptom of any such change.The Radical (Progressive) Party has given out a very uncertain sound on the subject of the Eastern arrangements.     It has so far-voted for their ratification, and some of its organs support the Government and consider that it took the only possible line. The great financial interests are nevertheless reported to be alarmed, and their misgivings find expression In leading Radical organs like the Frankfurter Zeitung and the Berliner Tageblatt. The Radicals had an intense hatred of autocratic Russia and disli: the dynastic and reactionary political friendships which united Germany with it before the w:r.     They regarded the old Russia as a menace both to external peace and to domestic progress. Now that the old Russia has been overthrown they hope to find in the new Russian democracy, when it returns to sanity, an ally and an example embarrassing to their own reactionaries.     These hopes have been blighted by the severity of the terms imposed
upon Russia against which she is bound ultimately to react. &quot;Six weeks ago&quot; says the Frankfurter ^eltunff^the right poiieyfor Germany was thought to be a peace of understanding and reconciliation with Russia.     Now, because the opportunity offered, that idea has totally disappeared, and Russia is made to feel the full extent of her defeat.&quot;The Frankfurter even thinks that it was a mistake to deprive Russia of her Baltic ports, especially Riga, for Germany will need a prosperous Russia with access to the sea for the convenience of her world trade.     As to the new frontier States, there is a great danger that when Bolshevism disappears, they may sigh for a reunion with a democratic Russia and become so many thorns in Germany side* Germany, moreover, has played the game of the Entente Powers by breaking up Russia and giving them an excuse for encouraging Japan&apos;s penetration from the East on the pretext of restoring order in Siberia.&quot;As far as Germany is concerned she has no more hope new &quot;  : than before of being able to conduct a Far Eastern policy except in connection with England and Russia.&quot;&apos;The North German Gazette on behalf of the Government tries to allay these fears by enumerating immense advantages which, it thinks, Germany has gained:     1. The military advantage of the end of the war on two fronts (the Russian and the Rumanian);   2. The political ad-^ntage of having burst the ring of enemies that actually surrounded her;   and the removal of the permanent fear of encircle-&apos; ment.   3. The economic advantage of the establishment of complete self-sufficiency, the ability to obtain from countries under Germany&apos; influence or at peace with her the necessary supplies of every kind. 4. Finally the moral advantage of the immense strengthening of Germany&apos;s confidence In her -cause. ^andJLn -her-final success.
Haumann of Mjttel-Europa fame is entirely sceptical as to the thirdof these alleged advantages and confesses&quot;Middle Europe can never he self-sufficient;   she can never be Independent of foreign imports.      .e can do what we like to acquire colonies.or limit our requirements, but none of these -things will render us Independent of foreign imports, for we need cotton, wool, copper, fat, fodder, oil...coffee, rubber, maize:   we require fine woods, skins5 furs, etc.     In war we can endure for years cut off from foreign markets, but that makes us only more dependent upon them in the long-run.&quot; Meanwhile it is satisfactory to note a declaration in the offici]\Torth-German Gazette that, owing to difficulties of transport,the German people must not expect Russian supplies till after theharvest.
