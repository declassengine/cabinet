SECRET,&apos;       &apos; W A R     CABIH E T3lS SE^l SI?UA?IQN W HUSSIA, Note by Colonel A.W,i?*Khoz.It is sometimes stated that the enemy has scored in the Eastern Theatre owing to his wonderful knowledge of the Russian character and because the accuracy of his information enabled him to appreciate the changing situation correctly and to foresee the future course of events,This   idea does not bear examination,     i&apos;o take one instance. If tha German General Staff h*i&amp; been in possession on the 15th July last of as accurate an estimate of the value of the Russian fightin strength as you wore, they would have v/ithdravm to the Italian Iheatre in August and September 20 to 30 divisions instead of the trifling number they actually transferred.     The effect so many extra divisions might have had in Italy may be imagined.The situation in the Eastern Theatre has reached its present dangerous stage, not owing to tho scantiness or the inaccuracy of your information but bees use of the delay in coming to a rapid decision in London and the other Capitals of the Entente on the information received.About a month after tho first Russian devolution Russian Officers from the front implored me to do ell that was possible to hasten Japanese intervention as they wore convinced that only foreign troops could restore disciplino in the Russian Army.     I reported theso conversations at the time but did not press the matter as the Provisional Government still had ample loyal forces in tho cavalry and artillery which might have beon used to restore discipline if the central authorities had only had sufficient moral courage to use them ruthlessly.Last/
Last September in London I asked for Japanese-intervention, &quot;but wa3 told that the War Cabinet would^have nothing to do with it.Things were moving fast in Russia , and towards the endof October when thousands of Russian troops had surrendered on theislands of the Gulf of Riga to a handful of Germans, even Kerenskiabandoned his silly optimism and asked for a British division to besent to Finland,On the 7th ITovember the Bolshevik Revolution took place.On the 16th December I telegraphed and ws?o&amp;e from Petrograd pointing out that nothing but the application of foreign 5crce inRussia would save the situation.On the 24th January 1918 the War Cabinet authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to approach the Allied Governments with a view to Japanese intervention.At that date there may have been people in England stillso blinded by class hatred or so ignorant of the Russian characteras to believe in Bolshevism;    these people must have been converted by now.   The terms of the German treaties with &quot;Russia&quot;, theUkraine and Rumania have enormously strengthened the case forJapanese action.    It must?be evident to everyone that a solidnucleus of foreign force is necessary for loyal and sane elements-to form on to oppose German penetration.Failing foreign intervention what exactly have we tolook forward to in Russia?1       The end of the blockade of Germany within 5 to   monthsGermany will re-organise the Russian railways andarrange for the transport of grain from the Ukraine,from the Volga Governments and from Western Siberia , cf butter from Siberia, of oil from Caucasia and of cottonfrom Turkistan through the Black Sea ports up the Danube. She will iiBke the copper, manganese and tungsten we have left at Archangel and the tea and jute and other storesfrom
from Vladivostock.     She will soon discover the stores of hides that the Russian Jews have hidden and will carry them to Germany to be tanned and made into the boots she so sorely needs.2. The definite passing of all European Russia,Caucasia, Northern Persia, Trtisrn Siberia and Turkistan into Germany^ political and economic sphere of influence.The Government of India has worried for 80 years over the spectre of a Russian invasion;    it will in future have something more real to fear, for German brains and energy are more effective than Russian.The Chinese will have cause to fear propaganda among their Muhamedan subjects.The Japanese have not yet moved.     It is understood that the chief obstacle is the attitude of America,     I do not know how the case for intervention was put up *o the American Government but suggest that the documentary evidence of Germany1s designs in the middle east afforded by the recent treaties has increased Great Britain1s interest in Japanese intervention apart from American interests or American sentimentality.It is possible that Government opinion in favour of Japanese action has weakened owing to the protests of Mr. Lockhart.     Mr. Lockhart acts as Trotski&apos;3 official spokesman so his views are interesting as showing the ideas of the international groups of Jews which now pretend   to govern Russia.     He telegraphs that intervention will alienate every class of the population from the Emperor to the peasant. This is ludicrously untrue.     Every thinking Russian is ashamed of the part his country has played in the Alliance. Officers have said to me:       &quot;I know I must pay someone and I would rather pay Japan than Germany&quot;.     The peasants andsoldiers
soldiers of the Sovyets are not going to rule Russia for ever; the very madness of their legislation ensures that.   Ho one has paid any taxes for a year in Russia; not one man in ten thousand has done a day1a work; loans    domestic and foreign, war and pre-war havo been repudiated; the State.and the individual have existed on robbery.   This cannot continue long.   The educated classes of the Ukraine have already called in the enemy to ssve them from Bolshevism.   There is grave danger that those of Northern Russia may do the same.   Our flirtations with Bolshevism have done far more to weaken cur position in Russia than any possible action by Japan.   The educated classes who have ruled Russia in the past and will rule Russia again thin  that we have abandoned them.   01* course such a ch&amp;rge is ridiculous but not so very ridiculous as another idea which is actually believed by many Russians in England - that the first Revolution was &quot;mede&quot; by the British Government who paid  40 millions to bring it off. I would not suggest Japanese intervention if I were not convinced that it would be welcomed by the few Statesmen that Russia possesses - such men ee Rodzianko, Miliukov, Guchkov.    I know that the Social Revolutionary Savinkov favours it and I can guarantee that Alexyeav and Kornilov willeIn another telegram Mr. Lockhart says he is convinced that the Bolsheviks will now declare a Holy War.    This is the purest moonshine.    If they declared such a war who would fight? Not the educated claeses who have reason to hate the Bolsheviks more than the Germans,   certainly not the degenerate soldiery who only support the Bolsheviks because they wanted peace.Japanese intervention must be neraided by a sympathetic proclamation from tho Allies to the Russian People (not     to the Bolsheviks, who should be ignored&apos; explaining that we hav   no wish to interfere in any internal 2 fsirs, and that we come in only to save Russia from the encroachments oC the Imperialistic Central Powers.
If the Japanese had moved last December they might have trained through from Vladivostok to the Urals firing scarcely a shot. I ao not anticipate much opposition now,     Siberia has&apos; a population of only 10 millions scattered over an immense area.     A few of the Bolsheviks in the towns may at first resist but as tke^e gentry are arrant coward3 a single example will probably be sufficient. The peasantsin the districts bordering the railway will be provided by the Japanese invasion with a market for their supplies.It is honestly believed that Japanese intervention if properly heralded will come as a relief to everyone in Russia with any sense of patriotism.     It will provide a rallying point for every-one in Russia who wishes to oppose German domination.     The first step will of course be the occupation of Vladivostock, which will be in our interests as preventing the stores there from failing into German hands.   A purely selfish Japanese policy would limit the in-vasion to the occupation of Eastern Siberia8     It must be our busi-ness to see that it cornss as far west as possibly, but if we haggle too much over terms there is a grave danger that Japan may make her own arrangements with Germany.Allied missions accompanying the Japanese relieving forces would enli3t Russian co-operation and gain the sympathies of the population by extensive propaganda.     Every Russian who offered his services to fight Germany and restore Russia would be made use of whether he was monarchist or republican, as long as he was willing to act and not to sit still and talk.     Every effort would be madeto enlist the co-operation of the Church, which has been insulted and despoiled by the Bolsheviks but has still a hold upon the peas-ant ry, and which should be made the main instrument in working the regeneration of Russia.If the Japanese regular forces can be carried as far west as Chelyabinsk, Russians and Oossaeks might co-operate through Samara in opening up communications with the Caucasus,     Agents would be sent to Turkistan to counteract Turkish propaganda,Our
ionOur main objects would be to provide a barrier to Gorman penetration to the East, to afford Russirn nationality a ehance or once more asserting itself, to prevent Germany from drawing unlimited supplies from Russia and to force her to detach, strength to guard her position in the East.A Russian officer who arrived last night from Italy tells me that the hope of Japanese intervention has put new heart into Italian, and  French officers,   ft is easy to imagine the depressing affect, which the news of.&quot; a rapid Japanese advance in Siheria would have on public opinion In   Berlin, the disappointment of the masses to learn that all was not finished in the East.Japanese intervention does not reqi ire the withdrawal of a single man or gun from other theatres cf war.   It requires no allocation of tonnage.   If it was worth our vhile to detach several divisions from our main theatre in order to help Italy, aurely the project of Japanese action in tho East uhich demands no such sacrifice deserves moro wholehearted appreciation than it has yet received.The work cf the   Oauoasian Mission is of primary importance in conjunction with a Japanese advance.   Ono-e it can reach the Caucasus it has an enormous role to play in combating German and   Turkish influence and in preventing the export of oil and act ton.Captain Proctor, vho knows Russia and especially Archangel well, is cf opinion that we should at once send an international force of about 5,000 rifles accompanied by two cm11 cruisers and some 15.-,001) tons of supplies to Archangel. The object of this detachment would be twofold: first to prevent the million tons of stores at Archangel from falling into German hands, and secondly to act as a symbol of allied force on HissIan soil to counteract the obvious   German propaganda which will cf course try to prove that Russia has been handed over by her allies to Japanese exploitation. The more presence of such a force at Archangel will have- / -   -

In this the Russian soldiers long believed, but they finally unfortunately sent a deputation which ascertained the truth.(Sgde)   Alfred Khex,Colonel.6 Draycctt Place,London, S.W.1. 13th March, 1918.

Memorandum by Captain ?. Proctor.

I. Trifling force at Archangel would give Germans considerable anxiety and probably require three to four times a bigger force of Germans (Austrians no use) to force its withdrawal which can be assured.



II. 15,000 mixed British, French and American troops thrown into Archangel, might be an incentive to the Japanese for real military co-operation in European Russia, with Allies, besides rallying patriotic Russians to our aid.



III. Primarily I believe 5,000 men accompanied by three warships could guarantee evacuation of most valuable of the ? stores, say 60,000 tons for which Ministry of Shipping say suitable transports could be provided if War Cabinet so desire. Later if policy dictated holding Archangel permanently, allied forces could be reinforced to do it.



IV. A ? d&apos;appui would at last be available for Russians unwilling to submit to German conquest, many of whom would ultimately join Allies.



Without a useful Base in European Russia, we are powerless to carry on any sort of projects whatever in Russia, including propaganda, which will be very necessary to prevent Germany making full use of her victory, and also delay and hamper her progress in the regeneration and organisation of the country for her ?.



V. An Allied force at Archangel would at least assure Russia&apos;s millions that the Bolshevik peace was not final and that there was still hope. It would keep the embers of hatred smouldering and prevent the speedy subjection of the whole of Russia, as well as give the Allies the alternative of later starting operations in the Eastern Theatre, if things do not go as Germany hopes.



VI. A period of about five to six weeks would elapse after orders from War Cabinet before Allied forces could reach Archangel, as some delay may be caused in passage through the ice.

Control Powers will probably expect no attempt at occupation by Allies till May at earliest.



VII. Telegram No.50 to Foreign Office from Consul, Forces, indicates that greatest peasant organisation in Russia, comprising millions of members ("The Co-operative") will not acknowledge the Bolshevik ? Peace. Reaction against Bolsheviks and German conquest and domination is certain but must be fostered and actively supported by Allies. ? of Archangel precludes this.



VIII. Most important of all is the political significance to Russia of Allied ? of Archangel, which will be welcomed by Russians as indicated in above Foreign Office telegram No. 50. A mixed force there previous to the Japanese entry from the East, would do much to reassure Russians and thus secure much popular support, which otherwise would be lacking, even if Russians were not actively hostile.
