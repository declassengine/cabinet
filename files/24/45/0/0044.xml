Colonel li^cirrnent is the Prc-^ ?lc (Wajestyls Covern:&apos; if ALL--^^^^j^rjBMARIMg COASTAL PATROLS BY AEROPLANES* Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet.She Admiralty have considered the Report by Captain L* Pierron on the Organisation in Prance of Anti-Submarine Coastal Patrols by Aeroplanes (War Cabinet Paper, G.E.3371).     The Report&quot; is of considerable interest, but it does not appear to disclose any new method of anti-submarine warfare.-The value of aeroplanes for anti-subir.arine work within 15 or 20 miles of the eoast has long been realised and aeroplanes have for some time been used by us for that purpose on several sections ofjeur coast, and in the Aegean for the last two years.   Tho results obtained have been distinctly satisfactory and it is to be noted that when certain Handley-^Page machines which had been used for patrol work off the North-East Coast woro recently withdrawn, the losses by submarine in the area in question immediately increased.The Admiralty do not feel able to accept the view that the comparative jmnunitv of the French Coast from submarine activity is entirely or mainly due to the Coastal Patrols, as they believe this iinaanity to be largely attributable to the paucity of the traffic along t !.iat coast.     Moreover, the Coast is a dangerous one and in many places submarines could operate only with serious risk to themselves especially in the winter &quot; months.   The enemy&apos;s policy has clearly been to &quot;nurse11 their submarines as much as possible and avoid navigational risis.The French Coast Organisation appears to be in principle the same as our own, except that our group areas are those for which the Senior Naval Officer concerned is responsible and the work of the aircraft in the group is co-ordinated by him with the surface craft.   This co-ordination is of the utmost importance and it is doubtful whether the value of it has been sufficiently appreciated by the French.    They also appear to have failed to realise the necessity of using long-distance seaplane patrols outside thoir 15 miles patrol belt round the coasto    It Is hoped that develop ments in the seaworthiness of seaplanes will shortly permit of largely extended use by then of hydrophones,The Admiralty have always been in favour of- using aeroplanes for coastal patrol and have now under consideration an extension cf the existing Patrol Stations-V ?v will gladly take and make immediate use of as many suitable machines with trained pilots as the Air Board can supply and thus enable seaplanes to be released for their more legitimate work further out to sea and with convoys &amp;o.
The suggestion made by Captain Pierron that pilots who are -war worn from the Arioy fronts could bo usefully employed in anti-subroarine operations over the sea would appear to bo of doubtful value, unless, at any rate , they first receive considerable training in anti-submarine work.Arrangements have already been made with the Air Board for the provision of some aeroplanes this summer for patrol work, and if, owing to the increased income of modern aeroplanes, an increasing number.cf older types can now be spared and the necessary pilots -upplied, they can be immediately employed on useful service and will be a welcome addition to the Aeroplane Patrol Force.-(signed)   ERIC GEDDBS.15th March 1918,P*So     I have diseussed this question fully this evening with Lord Rothermere and Mro ChurchfJ and we are preparing a further Memorandum on the subject for the Far Cabinet.(Initialled)   3. ..G.
