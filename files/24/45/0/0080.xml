randum circulated to the War Cabinet by Lord Islington0 280Foreign Office proposal to take over either the %H:q^eoJordal Office or India Office^1 ,3Q%&amp;) *1 (This Document is the Property oT--id$J His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)I have received, with some surprise, without any-previous intimation, the Foreign Office memorandum to the War Cabinet (GeTo3941) suggesting that the Foreign Office should take over either the India Office or the Colonial Office buildings0I think that the Foreign Office, occupied with its own pressing needs, can hardly have stopped to think what the effect of their proposal really would be, or have realised the disastrous dislocation in the business of the Smpire which it would causeo    Mro Long has already circulated a Minute dealing with the proposal so far as the Colonial Office is concerned,, and 1 wish to pretest equally emphatically as regards the India Off!ceo20 The India Office equally with the Foreign Office is a *warM department^ dealing for example with such questions as the administration of the Indian Army and the supply from India of materials of all kinds vital to the prosecution of the ware Its work has been greatly increased by the war and its establishment has been enlarged and is working at high pressureo The staff now numbers 5090 having increased from 364 in 1914o To turn the department out into the street in search of new accommodation would hopelessly disorganise and upset the important and urgent work that it is doing. ;3o The India Office building in a peculiar degree is the property of the Secretary of State for India in Q&amp;uacil. It was built at the cost of Indian revenues and the ownership is by
Act of Parliament vested in the Secretary of State for India in Councilo    The size and arrangement of the principal rooms are designed to meet the special requirements of the Council of India, and the basements contain a great mass of valuable historical recordse   The Foreign Office proposal would require an Act of Parliament   It would not be possible to justify such a pioposalj, cr to present it in a tolerable light to the Indian peoplec    The Secretary of State would be accused of sacrificing the interests of India to the convenience of one of the public departments of the Government of this country, or of contemplating, some great constitutional change in the relations between the Government of India and the Home Governments in anticipation, cr as part9 of the scheme of political reform which the Secretary of State is engaged in investigating in India a4o There is no possibility of finding another building which would provide suitable and adequate accommodationo   Even apart, from other considerations it would be a most uneconomical proceeding to empty a building used for 500 persons to provide accentdation for perhaps half that numbers   I understand that the present strength of the Overseas Trade Department is about 150 and that it is contemplated that it might eventually increase to 300o   It would not be possible to place iHUiu of the India Office building at the disposal of the Foreign Office as the accommodation bc^y suffices for the India Office staff and a small new top storey is at the moment being constructed^5.   Having regard to the importance of the administrative work in which this Office is constantly engaged, the vital necessity in the Imperial interest to avoid any course being taken which would cause its interruption at this critical period of the mr91 feel myself compelled to offer on behalf of the Secretary of State the strongest protest against this proposal being adopted-
