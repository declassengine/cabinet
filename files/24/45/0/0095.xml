REPORT relatlng&quot;&quot;to tEe*l?ar&quot;*Wo&apos;ifk*&apos;OT^thlTBOard of Agriculture for1&apos;Scotland for the week ending 20th March 1918.UEOOD PRODUCTIONThe weather conditions have continued to &quot;be satisfactory during the week. The work on the land is still well advanced and a considerable area of the country has already been seeded.1.   Taking of Grass Parks    The grazing accommodation to be secured&quot; for&quot; stock displaced by the extra cultivation undertaken by farmers has recently occupied the attention of the Board to a; . considerable extent.     Agricultural Committees have been instructed as to the procedure to be followed by them in obtaining the necese^r grazing facilities and emphasis has been placed on the desirability of effecting amicable settlements between owners and farmers.     Up to the present many proprietors have arranged with prospective tenants on mutually satisfactory terms but in several instances the Board have exercised oompulsory powers to secure that the nominee *-of the Committees should have grazing facilities.   The Board, hcw-:ever, have made it clear that intervention on their part under the Defence of the Realm Regulation 2M can only be justified in cases where outside accommodation for stock has been rendered necessary by the additional ploughing carried out by the owner of the stock and that they must not- be held committed to secure grazings on any exceptional terms for farmers who have made it a practice to take grass parks and whose circumstances this season are not materially altered.2.   Growing of Beans as a Farm Crop     In view of the scarcity of feeding stuffs the Board have suggested the. advisability of farmers planting small areas of suitable land with beans for the coming season to provide for the feeding of milk cows and thus maintain the supply of milk.3-   Defence of the Realm Regulation 2M    The Board have impressed on CommitTeos the necessity of reporting outstanding cases in which farmers have failed to carry out the work which they have undertaken to accomplish, in order that the Board may consider the question of issuing Compulsory Orders where necessary.     During the week the Board issued Orders in the following oases:-Section		Farm or Lands	County(1)	(a)	Climpy Estate	Lanark(1)	fe)	Newton Farm	Aberdeen(1)	fe)	Hatton	Perthfl)	(a)	Eastshield, Newmains	(1)		and Throughburn	Lanark	(e)	High Blair and Croft		fe)	for Waulkmili Farm)	Wigtownfl)		Drury Lane	Wigtown(1)	(e)	Castle Manzies Estate	Perth(1)	(e)	Barcosh	Ayr(1)	fe)	Monktonhill	Ayr.The Board have also issued a direction to the sporting tenant of Balmaoaan/
Balmacaan Deer Forest under paragraph 2 of Defence of the Realm Regulation 2M that the lands shall he cultivated (i,e. grazed) in accordance with a scheme for affording grazing facilities to neighbouring agricultural--tenants.C;;&apos; &apos;&apos; &quot;,..4.   Defence of ths Realm Regulation 2L.     The sanction of the Board has been given&apos;under paragraph 1 of the Cultivation of Lands (Scotland) Order 1918 to the To\m Counoil of Kilmarneok toy-enter on a small ares.of occupied land within the burgh for oultlfation in allotments.&apos;    5*   Hay and Straw for the Western Highlands and Islands:-Reference was male&quot; in a previous report to the serious shortage in the supply of fodder in the West Highlands.   The Board, through the agency of District Agricultural Committees have been able to get into touch with farmers in other areas who have surplus quantities of hay and straw to sell; and it has now been arranged that these supplies shall be purchased and forwarded to the necessitous districts by the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society and the Scottish Central Markets Limited. These two bodies are supported to a certain extent by grants from public funds for the purpose of promoting Co-operative buying and selling amongst Scottish farmers, particularly of the email holding class:   they have affiliated Societies throughout the districts in which a shortage of fodder exists and ars therefore in a position to conduct s fair and effective sehe!?6 of distribution.    The hay and straw will be supplied to th^ order of both members and non-membere of the local Societies at a rate which will cover the price of the hay or straw, costs&apos;of freight and other incidental charges.The Board propose to make loans to the two Central Organisations to enable them to make the necessary purchases on a cash basis. Tho loans will be granted free of interest for a period of 6 months.Iu view of the existing congestion of traffic on the west ooast and the need for sending these supplies of fodder at ths earliest possible date the Board have asked the Ministry of Shipping to provide a vessel specially for ths purpose.     If this vessel is made available, it is proposed to include in the cargo quantities of seed oats, seed potatoes and other articles urgently required at this season of the year by the crofters in the affected districts.6.   Seed Testing Station.     Ths number of samples received at the Station to date is 4,475.   About 7000 preliminary reports on purity and germination have been issued, and final reports to ths number of 3000, giving the particulars required by the Testing of Seeds Order, have been.forwarded to the senders of the samples. The work at the Station is now fairly well in hand and it is hoped that ths testing of seeds for the 1918-crop will be com-ryleted within a few weeks from this date.7.   Wart Disease of Potatoes.      With a view to assisting the occupiers of gardens and farms infected with wart disease in the selection of seed for this yearrs crop the Board have caused a series of &quot;sprouting&quot;- tests of the commoner varieties of potatoes to be made.     Under the Wart Disease Order it is provided that Immune varieties only may be planted In injected    v ground, and*i  tubers of these varieties are used it is praf tloaS.Iy certain/-
certain that the disease will not re-appear in subsequent seasons.   It sometimes happens however that immune seed becomes mixed with tubers of susceptible varieties and the main purpose of the sprouting tests made by the Board is to enable growers to satisfy themselves, before planting operations are begun, that the seed they have purchased is true to type and free from &quot;roaizes&quot;.   A fair idea of the purity or otherwise of a quantity of seed potatoes may be obtained if a number of the tubers are selected at random and sprouted in &quot;h-ilf-lightIf in a warm room. IC the tubers are all of the same variety the sprouts at the base will bear a uniform and distinctive colour and one of the objects of the tests made by the Board was to determine what this colour should be in the case of about 40 of the commoner varieties of potatoes.   The results of the tests have been embodied in a table which with general advice as to the method of sprouting has been prepared for circulation to all occupiers of infected premises. Reference to this table should enable all growers who sprout their seed before planting to be reasonably certain that the seed they are using is true to type.     Further particulars are also given in the table of the shape of the tubers of the different varieties, the characteristic appearance of the skin and the colour of the blooms they bear,G.   Sale of Seed Potatoes by Allotment Holders1 Assooiationg.   In view o&apos;f tha faot that all dealers in Seed Potatoes have now ib be registered, special arrangements were made by the Ministry of Food by which approved Associations of Allotment Holders who bought seed potatoes in bulk for re-sale to their members, should receive a licence for this purpose from the Food Controller on application being made through the Board.     The Board intimated this arrangement to all Allotment Holders&apos;Associations in the country and up to the present have recommended to the Ministry of Food that licences should be issued to thirty-one Associations.II.    COLLSCTION OF STATISTICS ABB RETURNS RELATING TO AGRICULTURE.MQfflLY ESTIMATE 0F^TjVl&quot;ST0CTA table is appended showing the estimated number of each class of live stock in Scotland at 4th March, with the usual comparisons; there is also appended a note regarding the estimated number of sheep..   FORESTRY1.,   Employment of Schoolboys.     The Board propose to continue during TKTcoming summer the&apos;ir scheme for the employment of schoolboys in urgent forestry and timber-cutting work in conse-:quence of the scarcity of ordinary supplies of labour for such purposes.     Forestry camps will be set up in various parts of the country in accordance with arrangements between the Board, landowners, timber merchants and selected camp oommandants, and the boys will be allocated during the summer holidays for a months work at clearing and burning brushwood, thinning young plantations, light felling and other similar operations.     The provision of accommodation, tools, wages, etc. will rest with the employers and the only expenditure which will fall to be met from public funds will be in respect of railway fares of the boys from their homes to the timber camps.
2*   Establishment of a School of Praotieal Forestry in Soojbland.Reference is made to the paragraph regarding this subjeot in the BoardTs Report of 27th December 1917.&quot; The Development Commission-:ers subsequently stated, in reply to the Board&apos;s application for financial assistance, that they were, unable to make recommendation upon a matter of so considerable importance to the future of forestry in Scotland until recent proposals for alterations in forestry administration had been decided by the Government.   The Board regret the postponement of the scheme since they regard it as essential that no time should be lost iii mailing provision for training men in the higher branches of forestry,   They have accordingly framed a scheme with the approval of the Secretary for Scotland for the establishment of a temporary school to be financed from their own funds and a suitable site hau been obtained at Dunkeld in Perthshire, where the Difre of Atholl and Colonel Potheringham of Murthly have agreed to give the necessary facilities for practical training on their private woodlands and nurseries.IV.

HOTE:-      The decrease in the number of sheep between 4th February i9and 4th March appears to be considerably understated.   The normal monthly decrease is fully 200,000, while, the estimated decrease is only 55,000.There is indeed evidence of diminished consumption.   The average number of fat sheep entered weekly at the 11 markets included in the Board&apos;a v&apos;eekly Return of Prices during 1917 was 15,500.Average during the 4 weeks ended .;/l/l8.......17 ,500&quot; &quot;       H M   4     &quot; &quot;   30/3/18.....13,000&quot; &quot; &quot;4      &quot; &quot;    27/2/18.....* . 10,000.This v/ould indicete that the total consumption during Februarywas say 140,000 - which is stiil above the estimate by 85,000.The number of lambs born in Scotland during February is very small, and goes only a little way towards supplying the deficit.   Hence the estimate given in the table, based on the usual sample returns, cannot be taken as representing the actual state cf things.
