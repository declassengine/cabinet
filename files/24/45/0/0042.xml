COLONEL BUCHAN explained that practically the ? of the staff of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Information had resigned in consequence of the decision come to at the last meeting of the Conference (G.T. 3823, page 2 at the top) that the Weekly Reports to the Cabinet on Foreign Countries should henceforth be prepared by the Intelligence Division to be set up in the Foreign Office and not by the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Information. The staff were composed of emin? experts occupying independent positions, and he was of opinion that each of them had resigned on his own initiative, believing that if they were no longer to write the reports to the Cabinet, there would not be sufficient work for them to do commensurate with their attainments and experience.



LORD BEAVERBROOK said he had no doubt that members who had resigned did so in the belief that they would be taken or by the Foreign Office for whom they would continue to write the Cabinet reports. He believed that they were attracted by the prestige of occupying positions in an old-established Department like the Foreign Office and he desired to protest most emphatically against being deprived of his staff. He had been informed that there was a Treasury ruling to the effect that one Government Department had no right to engage the employees of another Government Department without the consent of that Department. He would ask for a decision that if these gentlemen persisted in their resignations, the Foreign Office should not be allowed to engage them. He suggested that the ? course would be to revert to the position which obtained before the War Cabinet decision (War Cabinet 349, Minute 11) by which the Cabinet had approved the transfer of the Intelligence Branch of the Ministry of Information to the Foreign Office.

 
It was explained that the effect of this would be that the Intelligence Branch of the Ministry of Information would cos tinuc to write the weekly reports to tho Cabinet and that the foreign Offieo would be at liberty to constitute their own Intel ligence Branch if they so desired.TEE CHAIRMAH pointed out that this would, in effect, result in tho Intelligence Branches of tho Foreign Office and Ministry of Information respectively, each writing weekly reports to the Cabinet on the various countriess and deprecated the duplication of work which would be involved, particularly in view of the large number of papers which Cabinet Ministers have to read already*It was suggested that tho Intelligence Branch of the Ministry of Information should continue to write reports to the Cabinet for a month or two with a view to seeing whether the further duties which would devolve upon them by the expansion ot that Branch, would justify them in continuing to work in the Min-istry of Information, although the Cabinet Reports wore then transferred to the Foreign Office,LORD HARDXNSE asked whether, supposing at the end of that time, soa of these gentlemen&apos; resigned and wanted to join th&amp; Foreign Office, Lord Boavorbrook would still object to their being ta&amp;en by the foreign Office,,LORD BKAVERBROOK protested that ho could not agree to that.     Rs could not sublet to having his Ministry stripped of its staffs It would be impossible for his to administer his Department in such circiimstazioes,LORD HiSDIH&amp;E said that it would be- impossible for him to postpone for a couple of months the starting of an Intelligence Branch at the Foreign Office.LORD BSAVBRBKOOK eai&amp; that he would agree- to give up the Oabinet reports, and that all ho wanted WE3 to bo allowed to retain his own staff.     He said that he felt very strongly that with all the difficulties he was having with the organisation of his Department, it was net right that his staff should be taken away froa him,SHE GHARIMAB said that he would come to no decision at this meeting and asked Colonel Buehan&apos; to interview the mombors of the staff and see whether they would agree to continue with the Ministry of Information for a month or two on the understanding that the:; would continue, during that time, to write tho Cabinet reports and in the hope that the new duties which would devolve upon thorn would sufficiently attract them to allow them to continue with the Ministry of Information, although the weekly Cabinet reports were transferred to the Foreign Office at the end;of that time.Tho Meeting adjourned to await the result of Colonel Buchan^ eBouiriss..
