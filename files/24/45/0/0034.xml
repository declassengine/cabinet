(Thfs Document is the Prcperty ofIntelligence Bureau,Department of Information,PFW/C25.WEEKLY   B3P0ETOil   FRANCE. XXV.(March 14th,  1918)The last fortnight in France has not &quot;been very eventfuft.     The *nly--noticeable things that have occurred are two soaeches;    that ofand Verdun as guarantees cf French- neutrality;   and that ef H. Clemenoeau in the Chamber on Il&amp;rch 8th.The &quot;occasion of M. ?ichon&apos;s speech was the celebration at the Sorbonne .0f the anniversary of the nrotest m:: de by the Alsatian-attended by the President of the Republic;    the Presidents of the Senate- and Chamber;    the ?rime Minister;    the Archbishop of Paris and other grfa.t personages.     M. Deschanel, the President of the Chamber, took the opportunity of giving an interesting historical survey of the relations of Alsace and Lorraine with Prance frem the beginning down %q to-day.     He dealt largely with a series of treaties and other legal justifications of their gradual incorporation in France.     But from the modern point of view, and for the purpose of the issue as it presents itself now before-that Court of the whole world&apos;s ppinicn, wht-se jurisdiction Caunt Kertling has most prudently repudiated, the mere interesting part of what he said, lies in the proof he was able to give of the rapidity with which the Alsatians became French in symua-thy and of the tenacity with which they have remained so.     /ilsace became. French in the 17th century and at the very begin.iing of the 18th century a Prussian Minister -said at the Hague that it was &quot;notorious that all the inhabitants of Alsace were more French thanM. Pichlicn in which he revealed the amazing German demand farTouldeputies .$h the 1st of March 1871.Meetings in celebration of thisanniversary were held in all parts of France.That at Paris was
the Parisians&quot;:   and that the country was &quot;a brazier burning with the love ef France&quot;.     He added that whenever it was rumoured that Germanrtroops were likely to cppss the Rhine the Alsatians hurried t* arms to resist them.     ^That was true of the beginning has remained true to the end.   There is plenty of testimony.     The most emphatic is that of Jagow himself at the time of the Sabern affair.     &quot;In Alsace we are in an enemy country&quot;.     The whole celebration both at Ports and in the provinces, and the articles in the press wh&amp;eh it orovoked, will no doublj tend to steel the resolution of France not to accent any peace which does not undo the crime of 1871.     And it ought to check the growth of the indifference, born of war-weariness and ignoraace,. which is seen in-isuch incidents as that which occurred at the recent Sooialist Congress, when a delegate interrupted Albert Thomas with a vulgar expression which may be politely translated &quot;The people don&apos;t care a straw about Alsace-Lorraine&quot;.     It is significant that the interrupter was not thrown out.There is no doubt that there are a certain number of these French-men who. care neither for the history of the past nor for the general principles of to-day, both of which seem to call so loudly for the restoration of the two provinces.     But they can hardly fail to care for the safety of France and therefore if K. Deschanel&apos;s speech does not appeal to- them, M. Pichonrs ought to do so.     The documents which he revealed show twp things.     First that at the time of the annexa-tion the provinces were demanded not on grounds of nationality, language or sympathy, but on military grounds.-   Second that these military demands are unsatisfied and insatiable.     For whether the iranudent request f*-r the &quot;temporary&quot; cession of Toul and Verdun was meant to lead to war or peace, it in any case was intended .to. place France oublicly in a position of vassalage.     A state whie&quot;h without war surrenders two of its great fortresses has already surrendered its independence and is not likely   to get either that or the fortresses back.     But no doubt the real obriect was to force France into wax so
that, as Germany thought, she would be utterly defeated and dis-.membered at Germanyfs will.     This ought to open even the blindesteyes:   and still more the defence of this demand with which theGerman newspapers have net K. Pichon&apos;s revelations.     Like theGerman proceedings in Russia these arguments show that any pretenceof rcceptance of such general principles as those laid down byPresident Wilstn is always, and with scarcely any disguise, subjectft the reservation that they are always to be set aside   whenever thesupposed interests of Germany require it.     In this connection it mayGermanbe nfcted that the French Head Quarters have secured a/document of un-certain origin, butjiating from the end of 1917.     It is entitled &quot;Why we ought not to declare our war-aims&quot;-and explains with great candour that these, including the fiate of Belgium and even of the occupied parts of France, must entirely depend on the way the war turns out.M. Clemenceau was at this meeting and received a tremendous ova-tion.     There seems tfl be very little doubt that in spite of. the opposition of the Socialists he ig not only the most popular man in France but is generally felt to be the strongest.   The Socialists challenged him again in the Chamber on March 8th, and at last th*J7 dre\v him into&apos; the&apos; Tribune.     They have always complained of his sil-ence:   they are now more likely to complain of his speech.    It was one of those speeches, alternating between chaff of his opponents, personal reminiscences and stirring call to action,, which delight any audience:   and it evidently had an immense suceess.     Even the Pays (which though it is now owned by tt, Loucheur has not changed its general p*Mtical attitude) allows it to be seen that the Chamber was delighted with K. Clemenceau and bored with M. Henaudel whe at-tempted to renly.     The complaint of the Socialists was that the f. Government did not orevent the loyalist and reactionary press from using&quot; the treason trials as a kind of campaign against Republican -LmaC-M h j *     Tne ?rr-e Minister1 s reply was to chaff Radicals for -i
desiring to be protected by the censor, to declare his intention to de impartial justice and allow free discussion, and, aboi?e all, both in hfme politicss and in foreign to devote his whole attention to getting on with the war.     There were two divisions.     In the first all the Socialists voted against the Government:   in the ;v-eo second, on the question of confidence - perhaps in response to I-r. Clemenceau&apos;s pointed insistence that he did not desire the confi-dance of those who would hesitate to vote the War-Credits - many of the Socialists, including Thomas and Renaudel, abstained from votin and the minority fell tt 41.   The Chamber then refused to give facilities fsr another Socialist interpellation on general foreign pel icy.     The-whole debate can hardly fall to strengthen M. Clemenceau&apos; s-&apos; hands.Yet it must be admitted that the French nation Is now more di-tided into Sections than it ever was in the first three years of the war.   - The. unfortunate decision of the Socialists to refuse offioe when Mr Painleve and again when M. Clemenceau became Prime Minister:   their foolish and unsuccessful attempt to veto Clemenceau&apos;s appointment:   their disgust at finding that a Ministry could be farmed and could survive without them:   the folly of the Royalists and Reactionaries in not being able to resist the temp-tation to use M. Caillaux1 and other treason affairs to-discredit Republican institutions:   the unfeartunate fact that Clemenceau is a man of the last p*$itical generation and, like his contemporaries, is hut little interested in the n^w Social and economic questions which alone interest the Socialists, and that he is remembered rather bitterly by some of.the working -classes for the ruthless-ness with which he suppressed strikes during his former&quot;Ministry-r-. all thes.e things.have tended to create in and out *f Parliament a much more definite and hostile apposition than existed a year ago. One sign of this is the formation of a Republican League intended, as its promoters assert, to defend the Republic against the
-       1 2 iconcerted offensive of the Reaction.    Its Committee is &quot;formed of mem-bers of the Extreme Left, a few well-known Deputies like Violette,Renaudel &amp; Dalbiez; Merrheim-, the very Pacifist, and in other res-pects extreme, Labour Leader, and others more or less extreme of thesame party.   The chairman is Debierre, a Senator and the chairman of .the Radical Socialist party.   He has issued a long manifesto demand-ing the revival of the &apos;blocf of the Left, denouncing the union sacreeas a &apos;sacree duperie&apos;, attacking the alleged ill-treatment of Sarrail &amp;other Republican Generals, ,and the alleged intrusions of the clericalspirit into the Army and especially into the Hospitals, throwing doubton the possibility of-victory and distinguishing pacifism from $efait-isme.Of course it is all more or less cautiously &amp; plausibly stated, but itis obviously a document more calculated to give pleasure at German HeadQuarters than at French;&quot; and the whole movement, if it comes to ony-thing, which it may not, will be a thoroughly bad sign.   Against itmust be.set the satisfactory fact that, on the .whole the war-aimstheunanimously, agreed uoon in London by both/French &amp; English Socialist k Labout Parties, and by minority as well as by majority, are very near those stated by Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. WiJ.son. This has mode a great change, and patriotic Socialists, who a few weeks ago took a very gloomy view of .the prospect as to keeping the Socialists in line about the right sort of peace, have come back from London-much more hooeful.   They think that this comparative unanimity in war-aims between Governments and Inter-allied Labour will have a very steadying effect both upon the Army, if it needs it, and upon the whole oeoole at home.   And it is undoubtedly assisted by the proceedings of the Germans in Russia.   This is all to the good whatever view may be taken of the danger of the demand for an International Congress.There is little else to say except that French opinion seems hearly jmanimou3 in demanding the Japanese intervention in the East.    The Socialist orgrn however has now begun to doubt the wisdom of encoura-alng it.    At first it thought of Janan as a possibly useful Ally to a
Russian Revolution which, as this candid Socialist critic says, has called for more holy wars than any other and followed them all with&apos; an order for demobilisation.
