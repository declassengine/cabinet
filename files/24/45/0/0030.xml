PAY AND SEPARATION ALLOWANCES OF ITALIAN SOLDIERS. 

Note by Mr. Balfour.

I took an opportunity of talking to Signer Orlando this morning with regard to the question of the payment of the Italian Soldiers&apos; Separation Allowance out of British funds, as suggested in War Cabinet No. 361, Minute 7.

I gather that Signor Orlando was more or less satisfied with the position, and did not think it necessary for anything further to be done.
