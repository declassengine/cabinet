ALLIED , IjAVAC?   OOUKOIL. HOLLAND - POSITION AS^ggGAggS THE WAR.   PORT OP QOI^IME.The Committee are strongly of opinion that,   from a $aval point   of view, the requisitioning of 400,000 tons Of Dutch Shipping would not he worth the certain disadvantages which would arise from the entry into the War of Holland on either side.400,000 tons of shipping represents approximately one month&apos;s average submarine losses of Allied and neutral shippingsOn the other hand, with Holland in the War on the side of the Allies, thero can be little question but thf t her Eastern Provinces would very speedily fall into the hands of the enemy, with the result thst he would thereby aequire considerable   -assistance towards his food su/ply, while we should have to supply bar Western Provinces.We should also suffer from the necessity of supplying coal, heavy guns, munitions, end men to a fresh Ally, sad the tonnage required for the above would go far to nullify th$ advantage derivsahle from the requisitioning of the Dutch Shipping.With Holland our enemy, the Germans would be   considerably assisted in the eolation of the difficulties of their food supply, and would hsvo the great advantage of a number of  aval Bases so located as to afford %hm s considerable strategical advantage.The (rormsns would secure the full une of Antwerp as a Port. We should moreover lose our best   b&amp;ge for information from the enemy&apos;e country.Considering- the results of the entry of Holland into the War from the i-iaval point of view:-Apart from the assistance of the Dutch Army, which would have the effect of diverting a considerable German Military fores, the principal Military advantage to us of alliance with the Dutch would be   in the acquisition of ^aval and Air Bases, nearer to the enemy objectives of military importance, such as the Bms, Wilhelmshaven, Essen, &amp;ofef and on the flank of his $aval line of communication, between the Heligoland Bight and the Harrow Seas,The Dutch system of defense is besad on Amsterdam as the heart of the defence, then upon a defended ares, of which the front is formed by an almost continuous chain of broad inundations.?rom such information as is available, tho prospects of the Dutch being able to hold their principal line of defense depends almost entirely upon whether the spirit of the country is in favour of the war.Should it be so, there is e fair prospect of their being able to hold their water-way, snd it would be to our interest to afford them suoh assistance as they require in order to aecura the rear of the naval ba*es.
rThe defended area comprises provinces of North and South Holland, part of Iceland and Utreoht, and a smaXL,sco^tlon. of ftorth. Brabant,Any Naval bases which we desire to use must be inside this defended area.It is necessary for us not only to acquire such bases as we desire, but also to prevent the enemy from acquiring any bases at all if possible, but in any case to prevent him from acquiring those which would be most useful to him3The base which would be most useful to us is tho present Dutch Naval Base at the Helder.     This would form the best base for operations on the Naval eorganisations to the German Bight, and for giving Naval support in the Snider Zee to the defended area.     Tho HqoS of HoHard would bo of value in assisting operations on the Gorman (Belgian) coasts     But these ports are within the defended area.     Flushing (Island of Walogcren; would be still more valuable for assisting operations on the Belgian Coast, and for denying the use of Antwerp to the Germans, via the ,-bst Scheldt,Fat Walcheren is outside the defended area, although it is believed that the Dutch have every intention of&apos;defending it and the remainder of Zeeland, without which Walcheron could not bo held.Ymuidan would bo useful as a transport base.The acquirement of all these bases would bo in accordance with tho Dutch general defensive scheme.In the event of Holland entering the T,rar on our sids, our policy should be ;-(l) To offer Military assistance in furtherance of the gene^l defensive scheme, to tho best of our ability.(2) To offer Naval assistance in Monitors and River Gunboats to protect the flanks of the Dutch waterlino in tho Maas and the Zuidsr 2ee, and in tho Vest Scheldt to ascist in the defence of Waloheren.(3) To instal as protected harbours and naval bases      The Holder, Ymuiden, Hook of Holland, and Flushing.HOLLAND against thb ALLIES,There would be no strategical advantage in an offonsire combined operation against No11and.Any offensive operations must; therefore be purely Naval,- The greatest advantage accruing to the onomy from Holland as an ally would be in the use of her Ports as bases for vessels, operating in the Narrow Seas, or even as bases for invasion.Our Naval efforts therefore, in the event of Holland joining in the war against us, should be directed to blocking with mines the West Scheldt, the 2/iaas (both mouths), and the entrances to the Texel, Yrauidon, and the Hook of Holland,   Block ships should..also be usod as far as possible.
-M. Holland Joins us, it i^ necessary we should have advance information as soon as possiblo, as it would he absolutely necessary to eoncort with the Dutch the dstails of the- measures we should take to assist them.If Holland ^oins tho Central powers, no surprise operation is to be expected as a result, and the advance information is not so essentialsThe Corqmittea advocate, in the event of a raid across the frontier being made by German forces during a critical period when no definite declaration of purpose had been made by Holland, that we should send a Naval foroo to Ymiden whence the Inundation system can ba operated.     This would bo of considerable moral Value, and it is hopod would ensure the inundations being proe-coded \;ith at a time when tho Dutch Government might b$ hesitating to take such a drastic maa*8Uxo,
