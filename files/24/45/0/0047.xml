To meet this the defensive front system should, where possible, be reduced to a form of outpost line, the real defence being at a distance to the rear.(3) That an intensive preparation of a defensive system of great depth should be carried out,(4) That a large increase in machine guns should be taken up.(5) That the most strenuous efforts should be made to obtain absolute air superiority, and that un-remitting bombing attacks on &quot;root&quot; industries and communications should be scientifically thought rtut and made.(6) That plans for the use of tanks on the defensive for counter-attack purposes should be pushed on.(7) That a large -increase In the use of gas should be organized.(8) That an improved system of light signals should be worked up.(9)   ThatT    1    *
ll(9) That the confusion of enemy counter battery intelli-gence by use of dummy batteries, etc. should be aimed at.(10) That the question of economising tonnage by regular-ising sea transport services and changing the sources of supply of certain products should be re-considored.(11) That a gradual but large reduction in the number of animals employed with the Armies in the field ,should be initiated, and that a -revision of the transport establishments generally and more par-ticularly in the Salonika force should be under-taken,(12) That enhanced local production of foodstuffs in various theatres of war should be ordered,(13) That a reduction in canteen stores is necessary.(14) That the further exploitation of India and the East generally not only for foodstuffs but for railway material, munitions, etc. must be undertaken.(15) That there should be a general reduction in rations, such reductions being effected on graduated scale(16) Stringent regulations and reduction In the use of petrol.     Bulk supply to be worked up0(17) That the use of petrol substitutes should be pushed on as rapidly as possible.(18) That a further development of light railways must be made.- 2 -
J- iiiL jlSTRATEGICAL AHD TACTICAL. *JT;gstern front)1*     As time has gone on and the question of man-power has become more end more the deciding factor, so have strategical and tactical methods been altered.2..     The original conception of a bresJi-through. Tilth unlimited objective failed at the first and second battles of Tpres, at&quot;Loos, and in Champagne in 1915. The heavylosses suffered in passing the. enemy1 s defended zone thinned and disorganized the attacking troops;     and once out of support of their artillery they were easily held, by placed machine guns, or counter-attacked and driven Lack,O jl.3.     In the next period artillery preparations vere longer, more sustained and heavier., and the attacking infantr were given a limited objectivej     though this was still in so oases outside the effective range of the supporting artillery as at the Somme on July 1st, 19IS.        The conception still was that of breaking completely through the enemy1s defences, and pushing through the &quot;breach made a largo body of fresh troops.Yftien the first effort to make an immediate broach failed, as on the Somme and&apos; in tho German attack at Verdun, it was attempted to wear down the enemy * s resistance and use up his reserves by a series of repeated, attacks with limited objectives.        This strategy culminated.in the Passcnendaelc Ridge battle.4.     The history of all the &quot;set-piece&quot; battles on the Western Front in 1916 and 1917, visVerdun, S omme,Arras-Vimy, -Chemin des Domes, 3rd Battle of Ypresis very much the same, i.e., an initial success for the attacker and then a long battle with, but little ground gained and very lie aw losses on both, sidles.5.     Besides these large &quot;set^pieee&quot; battles, wo have several &quot;side-show&quot; battles, which were undertaken with a real limited objective, i.c, with no intention of either oFe*afcing tlirough or undertaking a long battle to we or down the enemy.       &quot;These are :-French attacks at Verdun, Wytschaote-Hessines, French attack on Aishe,
r &apos; - 1% f..These attacks were successful with comparatively slight loss to the attacker, during the early stages at all events.. 6..&apos;&apos;   Finally wc have the Cambrai attack, conceived on a different plan, which commenced with a complete success achieved at a trifling cost.7.    &quot;The inherent difficulties of a &quot;brook-through&quot; battle, i.e,, a battle in which it is sought to make a breach In the enemy*s defences at one blow, end then pour a mass of fresh troops through tho breach made,- are as follows(a) The breach must bo made on a wide front, otherwise, the communications of the force pushed into the gap are&apos;congested&apos;and its flanks threatened by Counter-attack, eg. at Cambrai.(b) There must be large numbers of frosh troops behindthe original attacking troops, as tho endurance of the latter will be exhausted in breaking through the enemy1s defended zone.. Those fresh troops must be -pushed through at once, before the enemy can bring up reserves to close the gap.     - All preparations must be mado for the supply of tho troops pushed through.(c) The original attack must bo made in sufficientstrength end must be sufficiently well prepared by artillery to enable the whole of the enemyfs defensive zone to be broken through at one&apos; effort.(d) Large quantities of labour and of road and railwaymaterial must bo pushed up to enable the&apos; trackless, shell cratcred vicinity of &quot;no mans land&quot; to be trcvcrsable by vehicles.To attempt to fulfil these conditions has meant :-A very large concentration of troops. Very extensive preparations; building ofrailways and&apos; roads etc. A prolonged artillery bombardment.All these&apos;&apos;give warning to the defender,- who is thereby enabled to concentrate his reserves, prepare defensive lines in rear, bring up artillery, etc.It d bes not appear that this form of attack should ever be successful on the Western Front,        The defended zone Is too extensive and highly organized to be broken through at one blow, and the communications in rear&apos; arc so highly developed that the defender con bring up his reserves to the threatened point quicker then the attacking force can make headway.--&apos; This form of attack must be expensive In men to the attacker, as to achieve the desired result quickly, ho must be prepared to employ a largo mass of.men end push on regardless of losses.If the Germans decide to adopt this form of attack In 1918, they can employ a larger mass than has yet.boon used on the Western Front.        But they should not succeed against a re-solute-defence wc 11 equipped- with mechanical devices.
8.     The second form of attack, which aims at wearing down the defender&apos;s resistance by repeated blows at the -same point, until finally a break-through with unlimited objective if possible, can only be successful in the k   conditions that :-(a)   The rate of wastage of the defender is very much greater than that of the attacker;or(b) The attacker has such numerical superiority thathe can afford to lose men at a higher rate and still exhaast his adversary, remaining himself unexhausted;and(c) The attacker can repair and make ooimiami cat ionsthrough the conquered zone so rapidly that his advance will not be interrupted.These conditions have never yet been fulfilled.The chief advantages of the attacker are choice of time and place and the moral which the possession of the Initiative gives.        3y repeated blo?7s at the sane point he sacrifices the greater part of the first advantage, and by repeated attacks with little apparent gain (from the point of view of the troops) he sacrifices a good deal of the second.It stands to reason that the effort in physical endurance demanded of the attacker Is greater than that of the defender.      He has to advance over ground broken up by shell fire, carrying a heavy weight, and to consolidate after the attack.     As regards moral endurance, once the defender has had time to concentrate troops and artillery on the front of attack, there should not be much difference.   And as regards wastage there seems no reason why the attack should have any advantage over a skilfully conducted defence,     The defender naturally loses more in prisoners; on the other hand the attacker&apos;s lines must be denser, as he must have suffic-ient men left after the advance to provide for consolidation and resistance to counter-attack.The attacker&apos;s difficulties in regard to communications as he advances are obvious; and he has to expose In the battle zone a large number of men to make and repair them.The Germans will not have sufficient numerical superiority to admit of their suffering much heavier losses than the Allies and still being able to outlast them.Therefore this form of attack should net succeed, unless the defence commits great errors. The Germans will have the advantage of a united command in the battle.9.     The experience of these battles appears to have shewn that(a)   By careful preparation the attacker can usually win an initial success comparatively cheaply;but (b)
(b) He cannot rcpoe/t his attacks sufficiently rapidlyto brock through tho energyfs lino before tho enemy can bring up reserves to moot him;(c) That onco tho battle front is determined end thedefender has had time to make preparations to meet tho attack, tho attacker cannot wear down tho dofondor rapidly;     the idea that the attacker is at an adventage once the dofondor is driven from his original prepared defences has proved illusory.10.   The above would seem to indicate that, if the strategy of wearing down tho enemy is adopted, it is bettor and more economical to strike at a scries of points in succession, with a limited objective in depth, and having won the initial success to break off the battlo, than to&apos; continue striking at the same point.This was., more or loss, the British conception for 1917. Tho Arras battle was prolonged at tho&quot; requestof tho French,The point is further exemplified by tho success of tho &quot;side-show&quot; battles, (para. 5 above).11*   But even in these battles with a limited objective, where no attempt has beon made to make ,a further extensive advance after the first attack, heavy losses have boon suffered during the process of consolidating tho now line, before proper defences have been made end guns moved up in support.        The now.linos have to bo strongly held during this period to meet a possible countor-attack;     and a groat many men have to be employed in the shell zone improving communications, bringing up artillery, material etc.        Losses from shell fire ore consequently apt to be heavy.12,   Tho logical conclusion therefore is, that the most economical method of wearing down the enemy is to.make en-attack in sufficient strength to enable the enemy1s first zone of defences and gun positions to be penetrated;     but instead of attempting to&quot;hold the ground gained end suffering the consequent losses during the process of consolidation, to withdraw to the original positions held, before the enemy has time to develop a counter-attack on a large scale, or to concentrate artillery fire on the ground he has been driven from.Tho advantages-, in addition to tho avoidance of losses in the period following the ettack-, ere :-(a)   No large concentration of troops is necessary.-(b)   No extensive preparations for making communi cat ions up to the captured line, or teking forward material are necessary.-Therefore the front of attack can bo more easily concealed from the enemy,.- 6 -(c)
15.   The form of attack suggested, therefore, as the best means of inflicting heavy losses on the enemy at small cost to oneself Is a raid on a very large scale, supported by tanks and a large number of low-flying armoured aeroplanes.     The raid should be designed to penetrate If possible as far as the enemy4s gun positions, and should be made on as wide a front as the available number of troops, tanks and aeroplanes will permit.14.   The objections which may be urged against this form of attack are : -(a) It can lead to no decisive results.   But it Is claimedthat man power will be the deciding factor, and any form of action which enables that of the enemy to be destroyed at small cost to oners own.will   * eventually produce a situation when a decisive result can be obtained.(b) The process of withdrawal will be difficult and willbe attended with heavy loss. If the attack comes as a surprise and is successful,there will be a period before the enemy has collect-ed sufficient reserves to make any serious counter-attack, or hamper a withdrawal.     There would have been no difficulty, it is believed, in withdrawing after the first attack at Cambrai.(c) The fear of lowering moral by withdrawal and thetemptation to exploit success will be irresistible. These must be guarded against.   The latter appears to have been the reason for the ultimate reverse at Cambrai.15.   The tactics of such an attack need careful study and practice.   It is suggested that tanks, escorted by low-flying armoured aeroplanes, should be the chief weapon to clear the way for the Infantry, part of which must be detailed to take up an outpost lino to cover the withdrawal.     Parties for tie destruet-ion of the enemy1 s defences and the removal or destruction of guns and other booty must be detailed.16.   The most obvious defence against such a form of attack is to make the front zone of defence a mere outpost line and have the main line of defence and the majority of the artillery fur-ther in rear.      This has the disadvantage of probably allowing a portion of the ground captured to be retained and must be con-tingent upon the area it is possible to give up without gravedisadvantage.-&apos;TheU)   fflae ntt.ae.klne infantry east ge the fcaitielightly equipped.      Their endurance will thus he increased,(d) Fewer troops need be used, if it is not intended toconsolidate and hold the ground gained.The above advantages will be greatly accentuated, if the attack is made with tanks when nature and state of terrain is suitable, as at Cambrai, and no long artillery preparation is &quot; necessary.(e) If the enemy1s defences have been well destroyed, hecan be subjected to considerable losses while repairing them.
Another answer to tho raid attack is a counter-attack of tho same type, with tanks etc. at tho same tine end place or as near in. respect of either as can be managed.Tho question of defence against tanks musU be &quot; carefully studied.        Low-flying aeroplanes ( even though ormcurcd) in Icrge numbers would probably best bo dealt with by a machine gun barrage;     possibly field guns could form a barrage to deal with them..17.    It would appear probable, on the whole, that the German object will be to try end force a decision in a big battle on the western front before the Americans can make their weight felt, end that they will only adopt the raid form of attack&quot;during 1916 to assist in wearing dorm tho morale and man-power of our Armies.The &quot;raid&quot; attack, on the other hend, is L particularly well adapted to our present need.s, which ere to gain time, prevent the enemy1 s efforts to force a decision and reduce his mm-powor as much as possible during 1918 while conserving our own.18.   The general conclusions from a strategical and tactical point of view suggested for consideration arc thereforefor(a) That/the Allies, who are not striving for adecision in 1918 but to gain time for the American effort to develop, the &quot;raid&quot; form of attack is best suited as a moons to reduce the enemy1s man-power and hamper his preparations for an offensive on any lergo scale.(b) That the form of attack which offers thoGermans tho best prospects of success, assuming that they wish to try and force a decision in 191 , is not an attack by large masses on a comparatively narrow front, but a series of preliminary operations at various points, designed to use up and disperse the Allied reserves end conceal the real front of attack, followed by a decisive effort on as wide a front as&apos;possible, at least 100 kilometres.(c) That the best form of defence, in view of thofact that the attacker can usually succeed by caroful preparation in securing a considerable initial success, is to reduce the front zone, wherever possible, to a more outpost lino, and make the real defence at some distance in reer.
..   .  19.     The German defensive in 1917 was certainly successful on the whole, and a detailed and systematic study of German methods of defence should, if not already made, toe worked out.   It is an interesting factj however&quot;, that if the estimates of our intelligence are correct, the German defensive was more costly in man^power than our offensive. In view of the present relative&quot; man-power sTtuation, our&quot; defensive in 1918 must not only be successful in preventing the enemy from gaining any substantial advantage, but must&quot; do it at a less ;expenditure of man-power,German success in defence seems to have been mainlydue to :-(a) The skill attended by self-sacrifice with, whichtheir machine-gun cores has been used:(b) The skill and industry with which they constructeddefensive works&apos;;(c) Good tactical systems of defence worked out andaltered to suit var^ring circumstances.That, their losses were heavier was eresumably due to(a) Our superiority in guns and aircraft;(b) The losses in prisoners the defensive must alwayssuffer when it gives ground.The Germans arc believed to have tried two or three different systems of defence) e*g.Holding front lino thickly and trusting tostrength of defences (on Somme in ^uly 1016, for example),The &quot;pill-box&quot; system of defence.Holding front line thinly and trusting to courier-attack to regain ground (Paschendacle Battle) *It would be interesting to see an estimate as to which method was most expensive. 0,     The problem of economy of maii-power by the fullest use of machine guns, tanks; etci, may be considered under three heads, given in the following notes as &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&apos;\&quot;A&quot;   Increase in the proportion of mechanical weapons, &apos;      and more scientific use of them.Tables &quot;A&quot; and &quot;3D&quot; attached to this paper show roughly tho proportion of other arms to the infantry in the British Armies in Prance, and the proportion of guns, etc, per 1,000 rifles,   A comparison with the corresponding German figures would seem to show that we can still increase the proportion of &quot;mochanical&quot; arms to theInfantryORGANIZATION Mb TECHNICAL,
Infantry; $ especially is this the case when on the defensive.The most obvious direction for increase is in machine guns.   These will always be the main stumbling block to the attack and by allowing defensive sectors to be thinned increase offensive power, and it is here that our inferiority to the Germans seems most marked, both in numbers and skill.   The German machine gunners are undoubtedly a corps dJelite both in skill and the determination with which they fight their guns.A reorganization of the British Machine Gun Corps is now being carried out to improve its organization and position This should be very carefully watched and fostered,     As regards an^1 great further increase in numbers, our man-power position is such that increase can only be made by a still further reduction of the Infantry,     The French have accepted this and reduced their battalion to three companies and one machine &quot;gun company..The above objection does not apply to an increase in the proportion of Lewis Guns in a battalion, and the proportion might with advantage be doubled, from 16 to 32.     Here again the French have more than double the number of automatic rifles with a Division than we have,Tho. importance of superiority in aeroplanes is of course ;obvious.      No effort must be relaxed to obtain undeniable air superiority.     Complete mastery of the air on tho battle-front, continuous day and night bombing of strategic nerve ganglions Of material and manufacture, will&apos;diminish or make impossible the success of any hostile attack.   Superiority in artillery of all kinds, and trench mortars is almost equally important.But as already pointed out, large increases in flying and artillery units must mean eventually a reduction of Inf on try units.Tanks are an economy of man-power in two directions: they can in favourable circumstances achieve results that a large concentration of artillery and troops would otherwise be needed to produce, and they also, by thoir armour, save their crows from casualties except against a direct hit from artilleryHo have at present, a great advantage over the enemy I:-1 having developed the tank earlier, and it should be able to play a groat role in the defence, if the proper organization and tactics are discovered and adopted.     We should make all possible use of it before the enemy finds an effective countorrAnother direction in which wo have a distinct advantage -and which should be much more energetically exploited, is in tho use of gas.The conclusions as regards this part of tho problemveryThe figures given can only bo a/rough guide, as we.cannot estimate the enemy&apos;s strength with accuracy and must give thorn credit for a full establishment of. guns etc, which they may not always reach in practice.The British &quot;figures arc on the old 12 Bn. Establishment (returns not being available with the new Establishment), but on the basis of the aotuaIk&apos; infantry strength, which was so much below Establishment that a calculation based on the new Establishment up to strength will make comparatively little difference in tho figures.
(a) The question of -tho proportion of infantry to otherarms requires study*   We have reached a point now when&apos;increases in other arms&apos;necessarily mean reduction in the infantry0A comparison with French and German organize -tions suggests that we can still -reduce our pro-.:.. tion of infantry; force of circumstances will indeed compel us to do so in 1918, and the best theoretical proportion should be at once decided upon.(b) An immediate increase of Lewis Guns in a battalionfrom 16 to 32, is advocated.(c) Construction of tanks and the study and practice oftheir tactics in the defence should be co. llr,-?od to the fullest extent and on the west cce; basis as regards organisation and personnel.    -.io. study should be undertaken by the General Biafi&quot;, and organization and construction made to conform strictly to their conclusions.Economy of casualties by mechanical or other means of protection, or by decreasing the numbers&quot;in tlie&quot;&quot;exposed&quot;areaVarious forms of protective armour, etc, for troops have been experimented with since the commencement of the war, but only the steel helmet has proved practical.The tank provides protection for its detachmentvand, in addition to fighting tanks, any development of the tank as a machine for carrying up material, eto. in exposed areas will economise casualties.As regards protective defence works, we have usually been behind the Germans, both in ideas and perhaps even more so in industry.   The deep dug-out and concrete pill-box were both developed by the Germans.    It is a defect of the national temperament that we are apt to despise protective methods,till experience of heavy losses has taught us the value of them. Greater use per man       hour of labour, white and coloured,and prisoner of war companies should be enforced.Strong defences, besides reducing casualties amongst the troops occupying them, enable less troops to be employed to hold them, and thus reduce the nwmbers exposed to loeScA very important point Is that in the defence of sectors, especially exposed to attack, previous preparations should extend to a considerable distance in rear.   Before the attack, these preparations - making of defences, the scientific grouping of wire to form pockets, careful distribution of machine guns and construction of emplacements, burying of cable, etc, etc.-, can be carried out without loss, and by labour corps, native labour, etc. while if we wait till bho attack is actually made the same work will have to be done by fighting troops under the enemyrs fire.   A better system of coloured light signals^to&quot;&apos;assist in the more supple, accurate and efficient use of artillery and machine gun   fire.The value of systematic deception requires further study.   Take, for example, the question of batteries.   Batteries are discovered on both sides, principally by the following  -means :-(a) A.eroplane photographs.(b) Plash spotters,(c) Sound ranging apparatus.The similation of battery positions on photogrr-nhp is an easy matter, if done intelligently,particular attention being paid to tracks.As regards (b) &amp; (c) the deception is not so easy. It has been said by experts hv over if et *&apos;&quot;0 following o^aid be-i &quot;*roduos a
produced4 light dummy guns to give the sounds end flash of real guna: (adjustable for different calibres) light enough to be carried in 1 lorry with a crew of, say, 8 men and a few telephonists.   What is required is a complete unit to fire from various dummy positions and upset the whole enemy counter-battery system, by synchronising Its flashes and reports with those of the real batteries.The matter has of course already been, played with, but never seriously organized.Similarly a camouflage unit can choose a waste pie*e of ground, and with so an tiing,, canvas, etc., can erect dummy dftmpa, dummy railways, etc.WCM    Substitution of Mechanical Power (other than weapons), for man-power).  &quot;    &quot;Tha third direction in which it would appear we can look for economy is by substituting, wherever possible, mechanical devices to do tho work now performed by men or horses.,&apos; One of tho economics which might be effected In this direction appears to be in the gradual reduction of horse transport, especially with heavy batteries, and the reduction of all transport by &quot;pooling&quot; on a broad basisi-   $his being possible ffith a stationary army or one that will only move short distances.Our 5-ton lorry for ammunition is too heavy.   A larger number of lighter lorries ia preferable.   Supply is faster and damage to roads loss.  .Every possible labour saving device at the front, in the rear, at the clocks, etc., is of value.   At the front it is of double valuo,- as it saves lives as well as ecomomiscs man-power.   In the roar it makes more labour available for defence work s, etc, which at present cannot be fully carried out for lack of labour.In all business firms labour saving is carried to a fine art, as overy hand which can bo saved from the pay roll moans an increase of prof ltd.   Wo have reached a stage now where ovory man who can. bo saved is of similar value..lit,  -TONMQE, HATERIA I AKD SUPF LIES.21,      In the foregoing sections ^kat may bo termed the more military and technical methods to save man-power have been do It with-   Prom a broader point of view, however, the saving of man-power Is obviously based primarily upon the provision of raw material and tonnagej   organization to distribute rav materials whore they car. bo most fruitfully and quickly handled.by manufacturing facilities to make th6se articles most urgently required and put them into activB use.-     &apos; 12.- The
The tonnage problem in this as in other connections it the meat important.As far as the military situation is concerned, the ecomony of tonnage rcsolvos itself into :-(a)    A pooling and redistribution of the oxisting avail-able tonnago and improvements In its methods of working, with a view to its more effective application to the needs of the Armies in the various theatres of operations and to ensure that ships never sail in ballast.(b)     Wiiether the needs of the Armies cannot be so varied or modified that tonnage would be relieved by the elimination of the carriage of non-essentials.These conditions must be considered in relation to ene another.22.   To take the first - Apart from food the outstanding trans port ail on questions are the carrying of the American Armies and of rolling stock to Prance,   Leaving out of consideration augmentation by a further squeezing of American shipping Mnes, e.g. those between North and South America, by building, requisitioning, etc., of the tonnage allotted to this service, it is of primary importance to see that the most economical use Is made of what is actually employed.23.    It would appear that time is being wasted In turning the American transports.   At present the round trip for ships discharging in France occupies about six woeks, and for those discharging in England, where the disembarkation facilities are better, about four weeks, though in the latter case troops have to be sent by train to Southampton where they re-embark for Prance.   The delay in tho round trip as far as those ships^ going afreet to France are concerned, is occasioned mainly by the fact that they do not carry sufficient coal to take them back to America, and consequently have to call at English Ports on the return journey to coal.   The remedy for this is.either that tho American ships should carry sufficient coal for the return journey, but this can presumably only be done at the expense of cargo, or that sufficient coal should be provided to enable them fo fill up at their disembarkation ports in France.   The feasibility of this lattor course and whether in view of the very insistent importance of hastening the arrival of man-power from America, it would ultimately actually economise tonnage, : is for consideration,24.   An Important propor tion of the American shipping is employed on the carriage of animals which are very extravagant of space, and require large imports of supplies to maintain them.   In view of the existing situation on the Western front where the British and French Armiesare equipped for a war of movement it seems debateable whether large reductions in the numbers of animals in their possession-could not be made - the animals reduced being handed over to the Americans and to the Food Production Department who it is understood are in urgent need of 15 to 25,000 horses to assist agriculture.   As far as the British Army is concerned, the following possibilities might be considered(i)     The animals set free by the suppression of a British Cavalry Division and Cavalry Reserve Park. (The further redaction of French Cavalry would also aoera possibio).
(ii)   The reduction of the Reserve Parks, which have no role in Trench Ucarfare.(iii)Thc substitution of Mechanic al Transport for some or all of the existing Auxiliary Companies on the lines of Commxinication..(lv)   The substitution as far as possible of Mechanical for horse transport in heavy batteries.25.   The effect of a reduction and re*organization of the animal power of the Allied Armies in the V/est would diminish immediate American Shipping requirements., and ease the tonnage now employed   In the carriage of corn and forage.26.   The utilisation of the existing trans-Atlantic passenger service between America end England for the carriage of such personnel of the American Armies as could be accommo-dated thereon, which could be equipped in England on arrival:27.   Next to the American transportation problem, is the question as to whether the tonnage now employed in the maintenance of the forcos in the field is distributed to the most economical advantage.28.   An examination of the sources of food and fuel sup^i for the various theatres in which British Armies are operating discloses(i)   As regards France.Everything has to be imported with the exception of fuelwood and b% of fresh vegetables. It seems that if such a system of cultivation as the Germans have adopted behind their lines could be developed, the necessity for importing any fresh vegetables at all could be abol-ished. The German advantage lies in the fact that they can practically force Belgian and French labour. It might also be possible to reduce importations by sea of rice and dried fruit by obtaining from Italy,- which is a large producer of both.(il) Egypt,Coal is sent from the United Kingdom. If sent from South Africa or India the risk to shipping, from enemy action, would no longer exist. For a similar reason, biscuit, instead of coming from the United Kingdom might come from Australia as it does for Mesopotamia. A system of return or round-trip cargoes might be arranged - e,g. cotton from Egypt to the United Kingdom, and other goods from the United Kingdom to South Africa, etc.(iii) Mesopotamia.Quantities of cheese and bacon are imported from the United Kingdom and pass through the Mediterranean. It is for consideration whether these could not be imported from elsewhere by a safer route, or whether some substitute could not be issued in lieu.29,   In view of the liberality of the ration, it is questionable whether the large quantity of canteen stores now exported from the United Kingdom to distant theatres could not be reduced, or in any case a proportion of the stores found from nearer sources or by safer routes in the cases of Egypt and Mesopotamia.
30,     The further exploitation of India and the East generally for Munitions, railway material, etc. for the Eastern theatres of war, in order to avoid using as far as possible the dangerous Mediterranean Sea Route.   This is all the more important in view of the present- situation in Transcaucasia, Persia etc. and the possibilities of operations in that part of the world assuming increasing dimensions.51.    As regards the second of the two considerations, the direct effect of reduction of imports to the Forces by the elimination of non-essentials and economies in essentials.(a) Reduction in the Field Ration(i)   For troops serving on the L^nes of Communication where the conditions are analagous in many ways to those of troops serving In garrisons at home, where the rations ha\re already been reduced.(ii)   A reduction throughout of the tea and cheeseration which it is thought may be wasted to some extent at presentsThe French Army has two rations for troops in the fieldLa Ration normale. La Ration forte.The latter is given to troops in the trenches or battle or to others performing especially arduous work.   The former sometimes with a supplement., is given to other troops even to Divisions resting.(b) Petrol reductions(i)   3y bulk supply.      At present a percentage of the petrol used, is for the transport of other petrol.   It is thought that by moans of large tanks (old boilers etc j. ) fitted on to railway trucks and transported from one or more base ports where petrol is landed, to Distributing Centres in the forward areas * considerable economy might be effected.(il)    Petrol substitutes.        Whether these have been sufficiently experimented with, and if so, with what success, not only from the point of view of their efficiency as substitutes, but also in so far as their constitutents would not make any such call on shipping tonnage as would nullify, or at least modify the advantages to b gained by their use.(c) Any possible development of light railways to save mechanical and^horse transport, especially on the Western Front, where a vast mass of transport is maintained against the time when a war of movement might take place.The
The French Army have, commencing from the time trench warfare set in developed such a system of light railways that it enables them to keep their mechanical transport on a lower scale than that of the British Army.(d)     Revision of tho transport establishments for the Salonika Force, which as far as shipping goes, is very difficult to maintain.     The for03 was originally equipped on a mobile scale for mountain warfare, when the prospects of an advance into Macedonia were contemplated, and though certain reductions have since been made, in view- of the present and as far as can be seen, future role of tho force, it is for con-sideration whether further economies might not be effected.A comparison of the apparently costly maintenance of this force where the Lines of Communication are very short with that of Egypt, where the Lines of Coimmmication are very long, shews that Salonika had on January 21st, 1913 27,384 Army Service Corps, to a ration strength of 170,278, or about 16$ whereas Egypt has 16,485 to a ration strength of 227,697, or about TfoEven admitting certain transport provision is made for the Serbians, the proportion in Salonika is ^e^s&amp;eBd&amp;afias&amp;j^.-h&amp;gfe, much higher than the French scale in the. same theatre.HvrTtidBrigadier-General, 13.3.18.
