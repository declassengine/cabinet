WAR CABINET.

THE ROYAL AIR FORCE AND THE RELEASE OF SHIPBUILDING PERSONNEL FROM THE ARMY.

Note by the Secretary.

The War Office have recently issued an Order to all Commands at home directing the release of all men from the Army suitable for shipbuilding.

This very seriously and prejudicially affects the development of the Royal Air Force. The Secretary of State for the Air accordingly requests, as a matter of great urgency, that the War Cabinet will direct that the War Office Order shall not apply to the Royal Air Force. He points out that the number of men in the Royal Air Force who were actually taken from Shipyards is ?, and he has no objection to their release, but the War Office Order would result in the release of large numbers of men who have been trained in various technical trades required for the specific service of the Air Forces.

A copy of the Order issued by the War Office is attached.
