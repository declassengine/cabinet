Memorandum by the Minister of National Service.The Shipbuilding Employers Federation and the Shipyard Trade Unions in their joint statement issued on the 15th March have reite-rated their request that the Ministry of National Service alone should be responsible for the supply^ distribution and utilisation of labour in shipyards.This demand that a single Department should be responsible for man-power in connection with shipyards is eminently reasonable and is equally applicable to other spheres of industry,   Employers and employed alike desire that thoy should deal with as few Government Departments as possible, that the machinery so far as it affects them should be simple and decentralised, that it should work rapidly, and that Government interference should be confined within the narroB-est possible limits and should be exercised with a due regard for local conditions and in co-operation with representatives of omoloy-ers and employed.   From the point of view of the Government it is equally necessary to simplify the administrative machine if rapid and efficient results are to bo obtained.   I have endeavoured to give effect to these,principles in decentralising the administrative work of my own Department.The Minister of Munitions in his Memorandum on Labour, Man-Power and Material has already submitted cogent reasons for vesting tho responsibility for labour supply under a single Ministry.   In this, I understand, he is supported in principle by the Admiralty] and ex-perionce has convinced me that it is essential.   As Mr. Churchill h&amp;3 pointed out, it is impracticable to vest this responsibility in a Ministry without at the same time making that Ministry responsible for the placing of labour, i.e. giving it control of the machinery of the Employment Exchanges.   My experience entirely confirms this. So long as there are three Departments, the Admiralty, Ministry of Munitions and Ministry of National Service dealing with labour supply, there is perhaps some excuse for isolating the Employment Exchanges under a fourth control, although even under existing con-ditione such an arrangement complicates matters and causes delay and friction.   But if the Labour Supply Departments of the Admiralty and tho Ministry of Munitions are amalgamated in the Miniatry of National Service, the arguments in favour of completing the amal-gamation by combining the control of policy and executive action are irresistible.   In spite of tho difficulties which Mr. Chamberlain had encountered owing to a dual control, I undertook to attempt to work under a similar system.   Lines of demarcation, easy to eatab-liah on paper, have been found impracticable in action.   There has bcog delay; there has been friction; there has been inefficiency.To take a single example.   Assisted by the Labour Priority Committee I am responsible for determining all questions of priority in labour supply.   These decisions have to be carried out by the Employment Exchanges.   But as a matter or fact only a very small proportion of the vacancies that are filled, apart from 7?ar Muni-tions Volunteers^ who are under contract to go where required, aro filled in accordance with priority instructions.   And yet, although I am responsible for issuing the orders, I have- no power to seo that they are carried out..
Again the decision of the Cabinet on the ^9th March on the Supply of Labour for Shipyards vests in the Ministry of National Service the responsibility for placing in the shipyards the greatest possible amount of labour of the&apos; appropriate kind.   But the complex-ity of control of which the Shipyard Employers and Trade Unions corn-plain is in no way removed unless the responsible Depar-t^nent controls the Government machinery for placing tho men.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer ai the Cabinet meeting expressed the view that the issuing of orders by the Cabinet would not meet the case, but that a single Minister should be made responsible for carrying out the general policy laid down.   He cannot be held responsible unless he is in fact in control.The position is illogical.   Whoever is responsible for labour supply, roust be in a position to control the machinery vrb^lch distri-butcs the labour.   Daily, employers and trade unionists press upon mo the neod of improving the working of the Employment Exchang03t*   when I explain to them that it is not my business they simply do not undor-stand it.   They say:   &quot;Are you or are you not responsible for Kan-Power?&quot;.   Involved distinctions as to responsibility for policy divorced from executive action merely mako them regard the whole Government machine as absurd.   Unlos3 this is changed and the respon-sibility for policy and action Is vested in one Ministry, as I have already informed the Prime Minister and &quot;the Chancellor of the Exechequer, I am convinced that failure is inevitable.If there be any question of personality, I am JftOPe than ready to make way for another man; but there must begone man in charge and a single control.As Mr. Churchill points out, the Ministry of Labour would eot^ tinue to deal with arbitration and conciliation with regard to wages and labour disputes, and with all gonorai labour questions outside the scope of the Ministry of National Service.   Tho Ministry of Labour would in a logical scheme deal also with the inspection of factories and mines.At first sight one is inclined to include Labour Regulation in the function of the Ministry of Labour, but after full consideration 1 do not believe this to be practicable.   Questions of roguj&amp;tion and labour are inextricably bound up with the administration of the Labour Supply Department; and to divide or duplicate the work of re-gulation would Involve delay, complication and friction. .. Moreover, we have now reached a period of the War in which, if wo are to bo ready to meet demobilisation, we m^st transfer the greater part of Labour Regulation to associations of employers ^md employed in the trades themselves; and such associations must be developed by thO30 industries in which they do not already exist.I am aware that the transfer of the Employment Exchanges to the Ministry of National Service for the period of the V/ar and for a limited period afterwards implies the vesting in that Ministry of con-siderable responsibilities in connection with demobilisation.   But as mobilisation of the man-power resources of the Country for War is tho function of tho Man-Power Ministry, so it not unnaturally follows that that Department should be responsible for demobilisation.This would also have one great advantage in the popular mind. ITho country would see that demobilisation had been entrusted to a
temporary Ministry/ which would cease as soon aa possible and ti soon as it was able to hand the control of industry back to Ind: vidual initiative and&apos; direction.. At present the. country is much afraid that Government control will continue longer -ban necesst and that a permanent bureaucracy having once secured control, w: be unwilling to.forego its activities. This ia a very real foa: I am sure that it is a very real danger, and is one which the v; majority of those who&apos; now support the Government are determined to avoid.20.3.1B.A. C. GEDDES.
