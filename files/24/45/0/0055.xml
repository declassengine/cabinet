CLEAR THE LINE.Prom      C.-in-C,, A.H.Q., India. Despatched 8.50 p,m. 15.3,18.To C.I.G.S., War Office. Received    8,10 p,m, 15.3.18.20991.   March 15th.1. Although my knowledge of the   general situation, theconditions and resources of the enemy, is incomplete,$yet in view of India&apos;s close connection with Eastern theatres, I am lead to offer the following remarks by a survey of recent indications in Asia. *^jr(A).       The Turks are falling back before us apparently refusing our attack in both Palestine and Mesopotamia.   This may, of course, be due principally to supply and transport difficulties.(B).      Aleppo is the concentration front of the enemy forces released from Europe and the Caucasus by the Russian and Roumanian peace.(C) It seems possible that the above factors point to thefact that the enemy&apos;s strategical plan is to draw us on in Palestine and Mesopotamia while at the same time tempting us to a detachment in Persia, his object being to bring about a dangerous extension of our Palestine and Hesopotamian forces, concentrating his own, in the meantime, at Aleppo in readiness to strike when our extended, and his shortened and improved, lines of communication enable him to attack one of our wings with superior forces.2t        I have nothing to say as to Allenby&apos;s position, but in respect to Marshall, we should realise, I think, that his front tends to expand in proportion as he finds it expedient to keep in contact with the Turks who invariably withdraw in front of him, and to control the Arab population who live in the vicinity of his advanced troops.    In addition, he is now ordered to detach troops into Persia and at the present time the commitments involv-ed thereby cannot be predicted.3. This last is a new factor since General Smuts started onhis Mission, but I have no doubt that when the War Cabinet decided to transfer one division from Mesopotamia the above points were under their consideration.     At the same time, I question whether it would be strategically correct to move any troops away from his command until the situation is more apparent.     It may be that all that is required In Persia will be accomplished by a small force.     But it must be remembered that the Persians on the one hand will be much influenced by their knowledge of Marshallfs strength and on the other will be perhaps emboldened by the news that at the present juncture troops are being withdrawn from Mesopotamia,SECRET.
