SECRET. * i+o^i^^X^rv^SMINISTEY  OF   FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, March 13, 1918.PART I. ACTION  TAKEN. Control of Supplies and Prices.s^PHAjj^SMf^ Requirements.-!!! connection with the 450,000 tons of pork products ^ ^\vfctCMr. Hoover reported as available for shipment to the Allies in March and April, Mr. Owen Smith cables, after consultation with the United States Food Administration&apos; that the purchase of 200,000 tons for delivery in these months would probably be sufficient to meet the emergency caused by the glut of pork products in America, The additional 200,000 tons, with the regular monthly requirements, would give a total of 416,000 tons beyond what had left on steamers for England up to February 28th. Mi\ Sheldon has informed Mr. Hoover that the Ministry of Food are desirous of purchasing the full amount of pork products available, but that they do not wish to consider this in replacement of wheat.Lengthy cables have been sent to Lord Reading giving him exact particulars of the wheat situation and pointing out the obstacles in the way of substituting pork products for bread. The gravity of our wheat situation may be gathered from the following cablegram received from Mr. Hoover by Mr. Sheldon on March 13th: We very much desire tabulation cereal arrivals for February from all quarters to England, France, and Italy, also table of stocks in England and France of wheat and dilutants. Cable as rapidly as figures are available without waiting to have them complete. Our breadstuff situation is in most serious condition and general stock-taking on 1st March indicates supply in the country of less than 50 per cent, our normal consumption of wheat and inade-quate capacity for milling dilutants to make up more than 30 per cent. ; under these circumstances it is utterly impossible for the Allies to continue their policy of endeavouring to maintain their stocks ; it will be necessary for us even on above percentage to totally exhaust the stocks of the country on the 1st August and I see no reason why Allied countries cannot walk parallel with us. For a better understanding it is therefore necessary for us to know what the actual mobile stocks are in each of these countries. By mobile stocks, we mean stocks in ports, warehouses, and mill; does not include bakers, retailers, or wholesalers who do not act on behalf of the Government. It is also necessary to consider separately the agricultural population from the town population; the latter can be supplied only from mobile stocks while the former can be supplied from their own produce. As to the latter it is only necessary to determine if the agricultural population has not sufficient supplies to carry it to harvest and base all calculations on town populations. The French, in fact, pursue above method of analysis. Robson claims English monthly consump-tion 750,000 tons wheat and dilutants ; this consumption is 30 per cent, higher than American of the last two months, and I am totally unable to confirm any of his estimates. Consider only way of arriving at positions is to start fresh, March 1st, consideration of stock in all quarters arrival at all quarters between now and harvest and base all operations on total exhaustion mobile stocks August 15th.Speaking at the Connaught Rooms on Wednesday, 13th March. Lord Rhondda expressed his warmest thanks on behalf of the British nation to the United States and to Mr. Hoover for the splendid help they had rendered to this country during the last few months. Our supplies of bacon were going to be considerably increased, and although the outlook for bread and wheat was not so happy as for bacon, there Avas cause for anxiety alone and not for alarm.Bacon, Hams and Lard. The very large offers of these commodities recently made by Mr. Hoover have rendered it necessary to make special arrangements for cold storage, and the necessary organisation is being created to deal with this matter.a   (33)5259-2  Pk 1   120  3/18   e&amp;s a
On account of the large anticipated supplies of bacon and other causes it has been decided again to revise the scheme of distribution and to base it on a registration basis similar to that used in sugar distribution. The scheme is being revised accordingly.The Conference with English and Irish curers to consider the prices and control of home-produced bacon has been postponed pending a final decision on the policy proposed by the Food Control Committee for Ireland.Brewing and Malting. On 12th March Mr. Clynes stated in the House of Commons that the impending reduction in the gravity of beer would effect an annual saving of 200,000 tons of freight. The recent surrender of 500,000 quarters of barley for use in the loaf represented 100,000 tons of freight, which would have been required if the barley had been retained for brewing purposes. The quantity of freight represented by malt requirements for the year 1918-19 would be approxi-mately one-third, of that required before the war.Butter-Further purchases of butter, in the United States of America amount to 543 tons at 41 -to 47 cents per lb., and 32 tons have been bought in.Canada at 38 to 39;! cents per lb. ; 1,100 tons have arrived from the Argentine, 87 tons from Canada, 93 tons from the United States of America, and 532 tons from New Zealand. The total quantity of butter now on the water is 22,241 tons.Cheese. Advice has been received of the shipment of 765 tons of Australian cheese, being the amount advised to be available for February ; 107 tons out of the 1,000 tons advised for March have now been shipped, and both consignments are due to arrive at the beginning of April; 114 tons of last year&apos;s Canadian cheese have also been shipped.Contracts have been closed for 2,055 tons of cheese in the United States of America, 53 tons of which have already been shipped; it is assured that there will be no delay and that shipments will be made according to the full estimated quantity.Cocoa. The Consumers&apos; Council have approved the three Cocoa Orders and the Instructions to Brokers.Mr. Owen Smith.has purchased 434 tons of loose cocoa powder now tying at New York, at an average price of 9d, per lb.Fish, Game, and Poultry. Unexpectedly heavy landings of fresh herrings on the &quot;West Coast of Scotland have caused some delays in despatch ; all possible relief is being afforded to the congestion. The total from Stornoway is 2,080 tons. Further progress has been made with Control and District Distribution of Fish Scheme.A scale of equitable values for coupons has been fixed to encourage public consumption of game, rabbits, and poultry.The Rabbits and Game Advisory Committee desire that steps should be taken to secure the killing of rats and other vermin by voluntary efforts, or that compulsory powers should be given to Local Authorities to see that this is done.Food Survey Board. The Board have made the recommendations following : (1) That an Order be forthwith issued further to restrict the amount of sugaravailable for cakes and biscuits ; (2) That the sale of cereal foods at philanthropic huts to soldiers and sailorsalready supplied by regimental canteens should be prohibited ; (3) That detailed accounts be required of charges for food at restaurants andhotels ;(4) That free buffets at railway termini should be at once prohibited.* Foreign Holdings. The Foreign Holdings (Feturns) Order, 1918, dated the 8th March, 1918, requires returns to be made by all persons who have in their possession, custody or control within the United Kingdom any article or any ware-house warrant, or other document of title in respect of various articles of food or raw material, which are held on foreign account, i.e., which are to be delivered outside the United Kingdom,, or have been sold to, or are held on account of, any person or firm resident or carrying on business outside the United Kingdom.Fruit Supplies and Preservation.-A meeting of growers is to be called at an early date by the Food Production Department,, to consider the question of controllingthe prices of fruit. .     % &apos; -. . .Properties at Newbury, Ely, and Wisbech have been found suitable for pulping stations, and negotiations are in progress. Four harges of pulp, per week, are leaving Maidstone, and 18 trucks from Pershore, approximately 410 tons in all.
. Meat.-The situation with regard to meat supplies has become rather more strained. The supply of livestock is below the estimate ou which the meat ration was based, both in number and weight, and demands on frozen meat therefore exceed anticipations; it was necessary last week to furnish 72 per cent, of the London requirements from frozen meat supplies, and probably an even larger percentage will be required next week.No complaint was received last week from any London Food Control Committee in respect of meat supplies, but some large industrial centres in the provinces are still experiencing some difficulty, although supplies of frozen meat are being distributed as widely as possible.The extension of the standard meat ration to all parts of the country will result in a very considerable increase on the present aggregate of consumption, aud for the next two or three months the present scale will represent the extreme limit of consumption of butcher&apos;s meat which can be permitted.Fresh steps have, been taken to delimit self-supporting areas in order that farmers &apos; may have increased opportunities of disposing of their stock near home ; accurate figures are also being ascertained of the surplus livestock available for other districts.A committee of farmer&apos;s representatives appointed by the National Farmers&apos; Union, the Central Chamber of Agriculture, and the Royal Agricultural Society has met at the Ministry of Food in consultation with the Food Controller^ staff on the question of selling livestock by live or dead weight. It is satisfactory to report that as regards the sale of cattle an agreement has been reached which will enable farmers to have the option of selling by live weight; the method of the sale of sheep and pigs is still under consideration. Lord Rhondda, who presided over the first meeting, has asked the Committee to form itself into a permanent advisory committee on agricultural matters.Milk. The Milk (Summer Prices) Order has been issued, fixing the maximum prices at which milk may be sold from April to September 1918 inclusive by producers, wholesale dealers and retailers in Great Britain. The Order also gives Food Control Committees power to vary by resolution, subject to the sanction of the Food Controller, the wholesale and retail prices, except in case of wholesale sales by producers. Committees are also given power to buy and sell milk at a price estimated to cover at least the cost of purchase and distribution, to make arrangements as to the distribution of the milk in their area, and to give directions to any wholesale or retail dealer as to the delivery of milk and its purity, cleanliness, and wholesomeness.Miscellaneous Foodstuffs. The question of the high prices of; pepper and salt are being investigated.Oilseeds. It has only been possible as yet to buy 1,000 tons of linseed in the Argentine owing to the requirements of the United States, but it is hoped to be able to arrange with the United States Government that the greater part of the United States requirements of oilseeds should be purchased in the East in order that Argentine linseed crop may be largely available for purchase by Great Britain.Sporting Ammunition.- The returns received from shot and cartridge manu-facturers with reference to two-thirds of the quantity of lead released by the Ministry of Munitions at the end of December show that the stock of cartridges in the hands of traders throughout the country was practically exhausted prior to distribution by the Ministry of Food. This distribution appears to have been effected equitably, as a quantity of the cartridges were sold in lots of 25 and even less.To assist the County Agricultural Committees in their organised pigeon shoots, arrangements have been made to place lots of 1,000 cartridges at their disposal. The same facilities will be available for Scottish Committees, when a list of the executive officers for each county has been received.The Ministry of Munitions have expressed their satisfaction with the arrange-ments made, and have agreed to release 150 tons a month for the next three months. They are further prepared to make special arrangements for the commencement of the game season, in view of the fact that a considerable proportion of the cartridges now being distributed have been used for the extermination of pests.Tea-The draft contract with the Indian tea-growers has been agreed with the Indian Tea Association.A deputation has been received from the Grocers&apos; Federation in regard to the retail profits allowed under the National Control Tea Scheme. - The necessity of a larger margin was urged and the federation proposes to bring evidence iu support of its contention. -  .
Vegetable Preservation. Four plants for the manufacture of Farina will be set up at Boston, King&apos;s Lynn. Hull and Monikie (Scotland). A Government mill is beincr established at Brayford, near Lincoln, and this mill will serve as a guide to the other plants in their operations. These will be run by a small syndicate &quot;who have agreed to take over the machinery from the Ministry, to run the mills and sell the Farina to Government. The question of setting up Farina mills in Ireland is receiving careful consideration.The experimental machinery which is being manufactured for sliced and dried potatoes, at Nottingdam, is nearing completion and the manufacturers hope to have it finished shortly.The use of potatoes in bread has been considered by the Consumers&apos; Council, who favour compulsion being applied to public bakeries, but think that the effort to promote the use of potatoes in private houses should merely be made the subject of a strong appeal.Vegetable Supplies. Since 4th February, 15,000 tons of Irish potatoes have been imported into England. The allocation of supplies with a view to relieving the congestion in South Wales has been considered at a conference of exporters and importers. The inclusion of the South-Western Counties of England in the scheduled area into which English potatoes may not be sent from outside, will result in an additional outlet for the absorption of Irish potatoes.Organised Distribution.Diminution of Food Queues. The estimated number of persons attending food queues in the Metropolitan Police area shows a progressive and satisfactory decline. The largest queues naturally occurred at the end of each week. Taking Saturdays alone, the numbers on the last four Saturdays preceding the introduction of the rationing scheme were : -January 26th     -----   567,000February 2nd     -----   546,000February 16th     -----   465,000February 23rd   --     -     -     -     ^   543,000 (last day before rationing).The number on March 2nd (the first Saturday of rationing) was 111,000. That on March 9th was under 24,000.Of the few queues remaining in the second week of rationing more than half were composed of queues for unrationed articles (e.g., cheese), for articles temporarily exempted from rationing (e.g., offal in danger of perishing), and rationed articles not sxibject to registration of customers (bacon and rabbits).The actual figures are as follows : Dates.	Monday.	Tuesday.	Wednesday.	Thursday.	Friday.

Complaints of shortage of margarine from various parts of the country, have been more noticeable in the past week, and requests have been made for special allotments pending the introduction of the Rationing Scheme. A shortage of meat supplies is still reported in some areas, particularly in Portsmouth, and other parts of the Reading Division, and steps have been taken to meet it.Claims.for increased rations continue to be received from various classes of workers. It is represented that the proposed preferential treatment is urgently required for manual workers, such as stevedores, coal-porters, &amp;c, and in the rural areas for certain of the agricultural labourers whose physical condition is stated in some places to be unfavourably affected by shortage of food. In the Midlands they are reported to be migrating to the towns, under the impression that preference is being given to the large industrial centres.Some apprehension is felt in Cheshire and Lancashire at the diversion of the local milk supply to the London market. Other exporting areas complain of the depletion of their stock by export to other localities. The working men of Inver-gordon, for instance, strongly support the irregular action taken by the Local Food
Control Committee to prevent export of cattle, and similar discontent has been remarked in North Wales.Local Administration.-Applications for increased representation of labour on Committees continue to be received, and in the past week the enlargement of 29 Committees has been approved, to allow of additional labour representation. A serious difficulty with labour organisations at Plymouth has, it is believed, been removed by the resignation of two members of the Committee in favour of two labour representatives.The Food Control Committee (Local Distribution) Amendment Order, 1918, dated the 15th February, 1918, gives Food Committees larger powers for controlling the distribution and consumption of articles of food, in respect of which no specific authority has already been given.Rationing Schemes. It is anticipated that practically the whole of Great Britain will be rationed for butter and margarine by 25th March. Some complaints have arisen of faulty supplies of both meat and margarine and of lateness of arrival, causing serious inconvenience to retailers and consumers, notably at Canterbury! Dartford, Wandsworth and Westminster.Supplementary Rations. Lord Rhondda has informed Mr. Herbert Samuel that he regards the provision of an extra ration of meat to heavy workers as the first charge on additional supplies. The Consumers&apos; Council have expressed&apos; their approval of the scheme under consideration and Mr. Clynes is in consultation with the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress as to the details of the scheme. &apos;Enforcement. The number of prosecutions in England, Scotland and Wales, for the week ending 2nd March, is 730, of which 661 were successful. There were 507 prosecutions in Ireland, 460 of which were successful. 126 prosecutions related to meat, 258 to potatoes, 118 to butter, and 82 to jam. The average fine for England, Scotland and Wales was 41. 9s. 4ti.. and for Ireland was 13s. 5d. The followinp- cases may be noted :- Under the Public Meals Order, on ten separate summonses, Mr. A. E. Morrish, Manager, and Mr. K. G. Lundie, Secretary, of the Cardiff Exchange Club, were convicted of using an excessive quantity of meat amounting to 6 cwt.   The fines amounted to 600Z. in all.At Chester Petty Sessions, F. Cottier, restaurant proprietor, was fined 601., including costs, on 10 summonses, for using an unlawful quantity of meat on his premises at various dates.Under the Milk (Maximum Prices) Order, 1917, at Sheriff Court, Edinburgh, S. J. Robertson, dairyman, was convicted in three cases, and was fined 100L in all.At Nottingham, F. A. Lewin was fined 60Z. under the Meat (Maximum Prices) Order, for selling pork at a price exceeding the maximum on three different dates.At Cardiff, two grocers were convicted of selling potatoes in excess of the maximum price, and were fined 501. and 10Z. respectively.At the South-Western Police Court, Georgina Stratton was charged with obtaining food rations by fraud. It was stated that the accused used coupons to which she was not entitled, and obtained a considerable amount of food. She was sentenced to two months&apos; imprisonment with hard labour.At Kesteven, Charles and- Sarah Ann Marfleet, owners of coursing greyhounds, Boothby Grange, Lincoln, were fined 10Z. each for feeding six hounds on wheaten bread soaked in milk.PART II. SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.In the following paragraphs attention is called to the rate of importation necessary if the cereal reserve is to be maintained. As matters stand now two difficulties present themselves. In the first place there is the risk that the reserve may fall somewhat rapidly before May ; in the second place, there is the need of replenishing the stock by the beginning of the new cereal year on September 1st. At present the stocks in question compare favourably with those held at the same date in previous war years,&apos; A3
Imports.The aggregate weight of imports of principal foods was 136,300 tons in the week ending March 9th, showing an improvement of 6,800 tons on the previous week. In the corresponding week last year the aggregate was 217,100 tons (Table A).60,100 tons of wheat and flour and 37,300 tons of other cereals (including rice) arrived, as compared with 36,500 tons and 32,600 tons the previous week. This week&apos;s rate is only about two-thirds of the average weekly imports of cereals needed for the coining six months, if the 13 week&apos;s reserve of wheat is to be maintained.After two good weeks the imports of meat and bacon fell to 19,700 tons ; the arrivals of mutton were very low, but bacon showed improvement. Sugar.was far below the average of the first nine weeks of the year, but the aggregate imports of the year so far are still&quot; 2^- per cent, above those of the corresponding weeks of 1917. Only 193 tons of tea arrived.The imports of oil-seeds and nuts and kernels in February reached 78,000 tons ; in January they were 106,300 tons. Only 388 tons of oilseed cake arrived in FebruarysConsumption.Meat. The supplies of meat at the Central Markets, London, and at Manchester, Glasgow and Liverpool (home and foreign meat taken together) in the week ended March 2nd were 1 per cent, below the previous week and 36 per cent, below the corresponding week last year (Table B) ; the weekly average for February 1918 was 4 per cent, below that for January and 37 per cent, below that for February 1917. In the case of home-fed meat alone the February average was only 52 per cent, of the average in 1917. In the week ending March 9th the supply of foreign meat at the Central Market increased 487 tons, while that of home-fed meat fell 373 tons.In the 59 markets tabulated in Table C the supply of fat stock fell 6 per cent, in the week ended March 6th from the previous week, while the supply of fat sheep was nearly unchanged. .Bread and Flour. The returns of consumption and sale of flour by bakers and retailers show that the weekly consumption in February was very slightly less or i-per cent.) than that in January, and 2 per cent, less than in February 1917 (Table E). Last year-there was an increase of 3 per cent, from January to February. It would naturally have been anticipated that the shortage of supplies of meat, bacon, margarine, and butter would have caused an increased demand for bread, but it appears that the consumption of flour in February 1918 was no higher than in November 1917, while in the previous winter it rose 4 per cent, in the four months.There was no great change in February in any part of the country, but the fall was marked in Ireland, Scotland, the North of England, and Yorkshire, while there was a rise in the Midlands (Table K). As the use of flour by bakers in bread, &amp;c, rose one-half of 1 per cent., the net fall is due to diminished purchases of flour in the counties where home-baking is common ; the flour may have been of an unattractive quality, and unsuitable for home-baking, and home-stocks may have been depleted.Bakers&apos; and retailers&apos; stocks have increased a little.

Fortunately there is no reason to anticipate a recurrence of the potato famine of last spring. Indeed the potato stocks must be regarded as a powerful factor in the maintenance of the food supply during the coming months.
Stocks.-(See Table FV, Cereals.-The.stocks of cereals are dependent on estimates from the stock-taking on farms of January 15th. . &amp;The following table shows the stocks of the principal cereals and the supplv and consumption darmg the first halves of the cereal years 1916-7 and 1917-8 :-   &quot;Thousand Tons.

In spite of their use as diluents the consumption of barley has been 66,000 tons less, and of maize 622,000 tons less. The consumption of oats has been 11 per cent, greater. The consumption of the four grains together, has been 1,165,000 tons less, hut since imports have fallen 1,765,000 tons an additional 600,000 tons has been drawn from stock. The stocks on Septem-ber 1st, 1917, were 1,245,000 tons higher than a year before and are still 615,000 tons higher than on March 1st, 1917. The stock of wheat has been depleted at the same percentage rate in the two, years ; the percentage depletion of oats and of barley has been lower in the latter year. Though the stocks are still above those of last year they cannot continue to bear the rate of depletion of 800,000 tons monthly which has been the average of the past six months, and a very considerable increase in imports is necessary in the near future.Meat. - In spite .of the demand at the markets for imported meat, the stocks of beef, mutton and bacon have been increased during March. The aggregate stock of all kinds of meat was 91,000 tons on March 1st, 1917, 90,500 tons on February 1st; 1918, and 91,400 tons on March 1st, 1918.Other Foods.-The stocks of butter, margarine and lard in cold stores and importers&apos;warehouses were 15,800 tons on March 1st, 1917, 5,800 tons on February 1st, 1918, and 5,100 tons on March 1st, .1918. The fall since last year reflects the increasing dependence on home supplies. The stocks of sugar, cheese, and of condensed milk are much higher than a year ago. Of tea the stock has only in-creased 3,100 tons during February and is still 10,400 tons below that of a year ago.Prices.Wholesale-The maximum wholesale prices of imported beef and mutton have been raised 16s. 4d. and 14s. a cwt. respectively and brought to the same level as those of home-killed meat from March 4th. Part of this increase is shown in the market reports of prices for the ended March 6th.

Though wholesale prices of English beef and mutton are the same as a year ago retail prices of the more expensive joints have risen during 12 months (Table G). Also the retail price of imported beef has risen about 7 per cent, while the wholesale price has fallen 2\ per cent.Retail prices have changed very little during February. The price of meat has risen slightly, the prices of bacon, tea, and sugar have fallen a little. Rice and oatmeal are a farthing a lb. dearer.The general movement of retail food prices, calculated on the basis of consumption in the months October 1917 to January 1918 (as in the Report for the week ending February 13th*) is estimated as follows : -1917 January 1st	-   100July 1st     -      -	-     -     -   114*,,    August 1st -	-  111*,,1   September 1st    -	-  112&quot;,,    October 1st -	-  106i,,   November 1st     -	-  1081-,,    December 1st	-  108&apos;1918 January 1st	-  108*,,    February 1st	-  109March 1st   -	-  109* For the index-numbers January 1st, 1917, to February 1st, 1918, inclusive, the prices were weighted by the average consumption in October, November, December ; for March 1st, 1918, the average consumption in November, December, and January was taken.
