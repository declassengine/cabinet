vTHE DELAY IN THE EAST.In circulating the attached paper by General Knox to the war Cabinet, I wish to add that Mr. Lockhart1s military advice is so bad that I hope he will be told not to give a military opinion in future or be recalled.(Signed)   H.$.GeneraI Staff,$ar Office,18th Larch,  1913.
The War Cabinet decided on the 23rd January to approach the Allies with a view to Japanese intervention in Russia, but no move has yet been made.It is believed that the Japanese will &quot;come eventu-ally, but nothing is yet settled.&quot;I wish to point out that in a military and political sense this delay is rendering eventual action more diffi-cult.As the enemy penetrates into Russia he restores order. He appears as the deliverer of the oppressed educated classes.     He gains adherents with every ki!ometre&apos;s advance among the &quot;bourgeoisie1&apos; who are going to rule Russia again very soon unless the country is to degenerate to the barbarism of the stone ages, and the bourgeoisie in Russia does not consist only of the &quot;idle landowner&quot; and the &quot;bloodsucking capitalist&quot; but includes practically every Russian with a culture above that of the beasts of the field.     These people have looked in vain for Allied help during the nightmare of the past months.     Is it any wonder that they now turn in their desperation to the enemy ?They reason as Baron Fannerheim,: who is now commanding the vhite Guards in Northern Finland, reasons.     Mannerheim before the war commanded the Brigade of Guard Cavalry at Warsaw,.     During the war he rose to the command of the 12th Cavalry Division.      Though no great leader he proved himself repeatedly to be on honourable ally and a man absolutely without fear.      In Finland he has had to call in German aid, not because of any class orejudJces but to save his country from the madness and tyranny of the extreme socialists,      who can blame him ?     Germany!s
interference and penetration may be uncomfortable, but at all events she keeps order with a strong hand, allowing every class to live, and her Government keeps the prisons mainly for criminals instead of allowing every class of criminal to roam at large as do the Bolsheviks and filling the cells with statesmen of the opposing political parties.The danger of the prolonged delay in the declaration of a strong policy in Russia is that the elements now loyal to the Entente, being driven to despair, will welcome German help and that once settled quietly under German protection they will require after their late experiences many months&apos; complete rest to restore their shattered nerves before embarking on a new adventure.?e have no means now of communicating with loyal elements in Russia.     Men like Alexyeev, Guchkov, Rodzianko, Milyukov and Kornilov are unable to give any sign while they sit watching at a distance how the Government of their late Ally negotiates with their deadly enemies.Practically the only official telegrams we receive from Russia are those sent by iir. Lockhart, and L-r. ^ockhart apparently sees no one except Bolsheviks.     His messages reflect only Bolshevik views.     ?;hen he says that all Russia from the Emperor to the peasant will oppose Japanese intervention, he means that Trotski or Chicherin say so. It is true that he says that Dr. Williams.agrees with him. If this is true no evidence of the agreement is to be seen in the Daily Chronicle.It is believed that two Individuals are largely responsible for the suicidal delay in Japanese intervention - the Amerioan &quot;Colonel&quot; Robbins and Mr. Lockhart.Mr. Lockhart.
Mr. Lockhart reported on the 6th February that he had &quot;established friendly relations with Colonel Robbins who has been working for recognition of the bolsheviks for the past two months.11    (Mr. Lindley&apos;s Telegram No. 3.RP,)On the 13th February he speaks of his new friend as &quot;a man of striking personality, whose energetic action had made Smolni favourable to the IMS. Government.&quot;I know a little of Robbins though I have only met him once.     He arrived in Russia, it is believed for the first time, in July or August last.     He came as second in command of the American Red Cross which was under &quot;Colonel&quot; Thompson, a large hearted American millionaire.   Thompson is a fat man and big employer of labour; Robbins a social-ist with private means.     They turned their attention at once to Propaganda and Thompson very soon spent a million dollars in subsidising a so-called &quot;League of Civic Education&quot;, which he had founded under the presidency of Breshkovskaya, the &quot;Vother of the Revolution.&quot;     I went to see him early in October and got the impression that his money was being used to boom Kerenski by a Jew secretary of the Prime Minister&apos;s who was an ail powerful member of the &quot;League&quot;.     Thompson himself was enthusiastic. He said he had subsidised more than one hundred papers and had purchased several Individuals who might give trouble to the Allies, among others Chernov.At the beginning of November General Judscn of the American Military Mission invited General Niessel cf the French Military Mission and me. to attend a conference at Thompson&apos;?, hotel.    It was explained to us that Thompson had tired of spending his own money, that his G-./ernment refused to help and he wanted- to know if Great Britain and France would.     Hiss sal and I refused.
On this occasion Robbins made an impassioned harangue in praise of Kerenski &quot;the only man who could possibly save Russia.11     Robbins knew nothing of Russia.     Within a week Kerenski was a fugitive and within three weeks Robbins had transferred his allegiance to Trotski.     If Trotski fell to-morrow and was succeeded by anarchy, Robbins would be sitting before the end of the month at the feet of the chief murderer and robber whispering offers of American help.       He is a fanatic with the temp-erament of a hero-7/orshipping schoolgirl, and while without the mental equipment or the experience to enable him to advise on policy, he&apos; is a dangerous companian for anyone as Impressionable as Lockhart.I have known Lockhart since he joined at Moscow 5 years ago.     His work there was chiefly commercial.   He arrived in Petrograd as unofficial negotiator with the Bolsheviks at the end of January.     I think a few extracts from his telegrams v/ill show how Inaccurate have been his predictions, and how absolutely criminal in some cases has been his advice.He had his first interview with Chicherin, Trotski1s assistant on the 31st January a day or two after his arrival and not much longer after ChicherirJs release from intern-ment in England.       Lockhart read the whole situation at a glance ana telegraphed on the 2nd February advocating recognition of the Bolsheviks.    (Mr. Lindley&apos;s Tels. Mos. 303 and 304.)      Pour days  later he telegraphed again this time &quot;fervently hoping that we would agree.&quot; In snite of his complete ignorance of everything military and of the politic, situation in Germany, he did not hesitate to state that &quot;Rus; is even now a more powerful ally to us than she has yet been owing to influence Bolsheviks exercise in Germany.    She is probably enemy Germany fears most (Mr.Lindley1s lei. 3^8 of 6.2.18.)On
5.On the same day he reported that Trotski had said &quot;quite definitely&apos;5 that he would not make pssace unless Germany withdrew her troops from Kurland (Mr. Lindley&apos;s Tel. 351 of 6.2.18.)       Could any statement be more-childish ?Trotski was absent at Brest&apos;but Lockhart hoped for great tilings from his first interview.       Hope also apparently ran high at the Foreign Office for it tele-graphed to Lockhart on the lPth February:     &quot;we shall await with great interest the result of your conversation with Trotski.&quot;       Lockhart like a very courageous bluebottle &quot;proposed to play with the Bolsheviks,&quot;     He was already deeply entangled in. their webs but the worst of it is that he continued persistently to buzz and people here to listen to his bussing.On the 23rd February he made the astounding discovery that the Bolsheviks were &quot;more patriotic than any other party&quot;    (Mr.  Lindl-y!s Tel..F63 of 23.2.18.)Everyone knows that the Bolsheviks are Internation-alists who do not acknowledge patriotism in  uiy form.   They talk of defending the revolution but not of the defence of Bus s i a.On the 2nd March Lockhart telegraphed &apos;u-ery urgent&quot; regarding Japanese intervention:     &quot;I implore you to delay action till it is proved that the Bolsheviks&apos;are unable to organise any opposition to the Germans.&quot;     &quot;war between Bolsheviks and Germans in inevitable.&quot;    ( Mr. Lockhartfs Tel. Wo. 3.).Next day he telegraphed again &quot;very urgent&quot;&apos;: &quot;Socialist Press is very warlike in tone and I have little doubt that Moscow Congress of Sovyets will d-cide cn Holy Mar.&quot;  (Mr. LockhartAs Te1. No. 4 J
On the 8th March he wined once more &quot;very urgent&quot;: &quot;Please remember that you are dealing with a people who being caught as in a trap ere prepared to sell their lives dearly,&quot;    (Mr,  LockhartTs Tel. No.  13 of 8-3:2.8. ).These three extracts speak for themselves.     It is difficult to imagine- throe sentences more utterly mislead-ing.     Sure ly Lockhartr s short acauaintanc e with t-he Bolsheviks should have convinced him that the only thing they will not sell is their lives;     they have sold their guns, their horses and their rifles, but not their lives.Two days later Mr, kockhart Cams down to ^arth, but with no apparent bump.     He telegraphed     &quot;It is now practically certain that the Congress at Moscow will ratify the German peace.11  (Mr. Lockharfs Tel.. No, 14 of 10,3.18.)Still on the same day he asks us to &quot;take joint action to persuade the Japanese to hold their hand till the need for intervention^is more-apparent.&quot;  (Mr, Lcokhart&apos;s Tel,No.He evidently thinks that Japanese intervention is advocated merely to save the grain of Western Liberia from falling into the hands of the Germans -    lie thinks that it will be time enough to let the Japanese go when- the Germans near the Urals.      This is not my idea of Japanese action. We want to bring the Japanese as far west as possible to form a rallying point for such Russian elements, social revolutionary and other, as have still a sense of nation-ality and some respect for the national Church.     We want to reduce to a minimum the supplies the enemy may obtain from European Russia, to combat German penetration, to save all. classes in Russia from &quot;settling- down under German protection, to hold some part of the enemy forces still in the Eastern Theatre.      It is strange to read of doubts for the need of intervention when the enemy is transferring force as hard as he can from east to west.
On the 14th March Trotski had the impertinence to threaten retaliation by making trouble in India and Persia (Mr^LoCkhart J&apos;s Tel, No.20 of 14.-3.IS)   They have already done their best to make trouble for us in Persia and would do the same in India if they could and will do in tha1 future even if we accredited 10 ambassadors to them instead of one L^ckhart,I have tried in these extracts to show that Lockhart&apos;s advice has been in a political sense unsound and-la.a.military sense criminally misleading.   Why is he retained in Russia? There is no evidence from his telegrams that-he puts the moderately worded reasoning of our telegrams adequately before his friends.    I am convinced that our cause in Russia is being more damaged by keeping a British official in communication with the Bolsheviks than it could possibly be by Japanese intervention, no matter how stupidly arranged.   The policy of flirtation with the Bolsheviks is both wrong an a policy and immoral.   If we wish to win the war and to safeguard our position in the east, we must support openly the non-Bolshevik, elements who form the majority in Russia.    If we merely desire the happiness *f Russians of all classes, we ha I better with-draw and allow Germany.to absorb the&quot;whole country and stamp out Bolshevism once and for all.How would Germany arit If ther-e were a communistio revolution in Sofia followed by th? desertion of the whole Bulgarian army?      Shft would send troops to quell the revolution economising them from other fronts and carrying them along her war worn railways. Oar problemIs easier.     We do not. propose to suppress the Revolution. We send an ally to Russia to support the majority of the Russian people, to help the Armenians T/ho have been handed over to. the Turks, the L^tts who have been handed over by the Baltic Barons to Germany - in a word everyone whowishes
wishes to be free.    We can do this without withdrawing strength from any front and without taxing our transport.(Signed)   A. Knox-Gel onel.,18 o 3 c 1 Gl*
