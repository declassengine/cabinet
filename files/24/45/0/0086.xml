Intelligence bureau,SECRET.Department of Information.24.MEMORANDUM OK SIBERIA.  II.(Commercial and Political Development).Commercial Development of Siberia previous to the War.The Sibiriak, or descendant of the old settlers, having never been subject to the degradation of serfdom, though he was officially described in his passport as a peasant, has really been something more in the nature of a communal agriculturist or small-holding farmer.    In addition, the abler business minds amongst them set themselves&apos;to the problem of facilitating routes of export, and stimulating the development of Co-operative Societie which have in Siberia the practical.significance of trades unions. Whilst ever on the outlook for new capital and new markets, and even striving to create a manufacturing centre in the Altai, they have been guided by recognition of the fact that the export of raw products and the import of manufactured goods is the safest principle to folio?/ in the interest of the economic growth of Siberia.The extent of this growth in recent years has been very much-better appreciated in Germany than in this country, and is probably an operative factor in the elaboration of German designs upon Russia.   Previous to the war with Japan, the Russian interest in Siberia was most casual.   To produce this state of affairs several factors co-operated, - the instinctive aversion, owing to the circumstance that the country was a penal colony, the lack of desire on the part of the Russian Government to organise really sound progressive colonising work, fearing that its results would weaken the position of the Central Government, the enormous distances, the severity of the climate etc.     After that war everv -thing was changed.     Not merely did the E-ibiriaksy-owing to the
qualities already referred to (in Pant I), feel acutely the repercussion of the revolutionary activities of 1905, hut the Central Government, through its more intimate association with the country during the period of the war, realised the value of its vast   resources for the recuperation of Russia as it had never done before.   A decision was taken to send no more convicts to Siberia, and a new scheme, of colonisation, particularly for Eastern Siberia, was vigorously pushed.Previous to 1896 the total annual Government outlay in connectio with Siberian colonisation was never more than one million rubles, and sometimes it was less.    In 1906 the expenditure was about 5 millions;    in 1909 it had risen to 22h millions,   For 19.14 the budget estimate was 30 millions.   Again, in the three centuries previous to 1896 about 3 million people emigrated to Siberia, -settlers, convicts etc.:   whereas during the decade 1896-1905 the total number of emigrants was 1,370,000:   from 1905 to 1913 there have been 3 million settlers.   At the same time this rate of increase has not been progressive.   The writer had the opportunity of accompanying the Secretary of State who was sent out to enquire into the disasters that attended the totally unlooked-for stream of emigration in 1896.   Subsequently the strewn subsided, only to reach a maximum again in 1908 (759,000) from which figure it has&apos; again receded for various reasons (occupation of most accessible lands, institution of restrictions etc.) to 327,000 in 1913.The recognition of the Governments failure to meet the whole situation is particularly clear in a Report of the Ministry of Agriculture covering the period 1909-1913, in which it is admitted that although much had   been done, yet it was not nearly enough, and that much more must be attempted in the way of previous preparation of tracts assigned for settlement in the matter of
the construction of new roads, sinking of wells when necessary, erection of hospitals, organisation of postal facilities, as also a more definite and energetic encouragement of cultural relations in the regions already settled, by an increase in the number of schools and churchese     The opinion was further expressed that better instruction in agriculture must be provided for the settlers, that railway development must be hastened, particularly in connection with the South Siberian trunk-line through the Kirghiz Steppe, and that, generally, a more scientific and less haphazard attitude must be adopted towards the whole   question of the colonisation of SiberiaIn every way the position of the Sibiriak is more advantageous than that of the European Russian.     His land-holding is larger, averaging 8t15 dessiatines   as a member of a community, and 30-50 as a separate private owner, as against the Russian average of 4,5 dessiatines.   A law of 1881 enacted that in the case of all holdings of more than 15 dessiatines per individual head of a family in a community, the surplus must be returned to the community for distribution amongst new settlers.     Loans are granted to the settler of from 250 to 400 rubles depending on the locality, repayment of which   does not begin till after 5 years, and then only by a process of instalments over a period of ten years. Further, the new settler is relieved from taxation during the first five years of his new life, and In the second quinquennium he pays half the rate:   only after ten years5 residence is he put on the same plane as the old settlers in the matter df State taxation.   For the local community dues he is, however, liable from the beginning.Siberia is rich in mineral wealth of gold, silver, copper, lead and iron,   Coal beds have also been located, and petroleum
4ehas been found in Sakhalin.   The wealth in forests and river fisheries is incalculable, hut the real gold of Siberia is its &quot;black-eaEth&quot;.   Dairy produce will probably be the dominant industry in Western Siberia;   the export of butter rose from 2,440,000 kilograms in 1898, to 140,870,000 kilograms in 1909. Central Siberia will be the grain area par excellence, where the average yield per dessiatine of the principal cereals is higher than in European Russia.    Intensive cultivation would permit of the country supporting an immensely greater population, in addition tc whatever quantity might be exported.Political Development previous to the Revolution.For many years the Siberian towns have had their own municipalities and consequent local self-government1, but the same has net been the case with the country districts, which have been directly under the State.   Ever since the revolutionary activity of 1905 in particular there has been a strong movement in Sibiriak circles, having for its aim the introduction of the Zemstvo, so that all local affairs such as education, raising of funds for the construction of roads etc. might become the subject or direct administration on the spot by those acquainted at firsthand with the conditions.   The opposing view, that of the minority, followed the line that inasmuch es there was no class of nobility or large-landed proprietors in Siberia, since on the contrary-it*was a peasant realm, the great majority of whose inhabitants were unfitted for self-administration, centralised government was much more suited for the country.    It has not apparently occurred to the minority that conditions such as they describe are also found in the Governments of Viatka and even Perm in European Russia, where the Zemstvo was introduced with gsod results,,   Although not very
favourably received by the Duma in 1912, the proposal for the introduction of the Zemstvo on a limited scale was passed later. A logical development of the majority views led to a further demand for a Siberian Duma with local authorities responsible to it, whose task would be the formulation and administration of strictly Siberian affairs in which European Russia had no direct interest, whilst members from it would be sent to the Imperial Duma in Petrograd for the joint consideration of matters that affected the Empire as a whole.    It is not surprising that this movement received no encouragement from the Central Government who feared that it might lead to separation.    In fact by a series of petty restrictions the Central Government deliberately set itself to the task of trying to eradicate whatever was distinctive in Siberian thought and custom, and endeavoured to bring the whole country under a thoroughly European Russian ascendency of political and social practice.    It is     possible that the marked privileges accorded to new settlers in Siberia were part of this policy.   Quite apart from the motives of jealousy on the part of the Central Government, such action, however, was unnecessary.   For the Sibiriak are not a subjugated race:   they are a part of Russia who will never wish to be absolutely independent of Russia, and who will always feel themselves in a certain measure opposed to the Asiatic peoples in the South and East of their territory.From the Revolution onwards.Accounts of the celebration of the Revolution of March 1917 in different towns in Siberia, as e.g. Blagovestchensk, Khatarovsk and Vladivostok, shove it to have followed a more or less stereotyped orderly programme, into which the usual elements of processions, divine service, speech-making and general holiday-making all entered.   Comment is in particular made upon the enthusiasm and
solidarity of the population in. these celebrations, - &quot;there were no spectators&quot; - as also on their complete freedom from any disorderliness.   All materials in red were sold out;   Eastern Siberia became familiar with the Marseillaise;   the watch-words of . Petrograd processions were re-echoed in the streets of Irkutsk,One of the first results of the Revolution was to give a tremendous impetus to the old question of Siberian autonomy, which was to have been made the subject of a demand at the Constituent Assembly.   The general idea entertained of the Russian Republic was that of a Federated Republic of $blasts or Provinces,w ith bre-ad measures of self-determination.   There would, therefore, be a Siberian Duma which would take over all matters of local legislation and administration, - the distribution of lands, waters, etc., in short all questions relating to the independent economic and cultural development of Siberia:    on the other hand, all questions dealing with the united Russian army, foreign policy, post and telegraph, customs and State finance as a whole would be left for the Imperial Duma.   The Siberian papers about this period were full of letters from Siberian officers and men urging such a policy, saying that it had   been won by the sacrifices of the Siberian troops, and pointing out in particular that something of this character must be done to save the country from the exploitation that had for long been going on.Resolutions along these lines were carried at a political conference for the Government of Tomsk held in the month of May, although opposition declared itself on the part of the Social Revolutionary party and also the Cadets.     Similar conferences in other towns showed a like feeling.   The argumentation against it alwavs proceeded on the familiar line that a Siberian Duma would
Oliolead to the weakening of the Central Authority, that it really meant setting up a State within the State, which logically involves the disruption of the State.   Opposition was also based on the denial of the existence of special Siberian interests:   the friends of Siberia are in the West, not in the East;   whence does she get her trade and commerce? and so on.   But the general trend of sympathy was with the view that too much centralisation was not good or e&amp;peditious, that it was impossible for the 16 Siberian deputies in the State Duma to have a full understanding of Siberian conditions, and that every proposal of legislation for Siberia should be elaborated on the spot before it was finally submitted to the State Duma.With the progress of anarchy in European Russia and the threat of its spreading to Siberia there went an intensive deepening of Siberian feeling that it was necessary to undertake the salvation of their own country for themselves.   This expressed itself finally in December in the proclamation of Siberia as an autonomous republic within the Russian Federation under the presidency of Professor Potanin of Tomsk, a well-known botanist and traveller, who had taken a considerable part in the revolutionary proceedings of 1905 in Siberia.   The seat of this Provisional Government was fixed at Omsk.As it happened, the existence of that Government, which was Social Revolutionary in character, was comparatively shortlived. The results of the Bolshevik coup d&apos;etat of November 9 gradually began to permeate Siberia, and a telegram of February 14 from the British Consul at Krasnoyarsk describes the arrest of the Government members and their conveyance to that town for imprisonment.   He also adds that the only banks allowed to operate are the State Bank for official business, and the Siberian Bank, the capital of which is German, for the conduct of ordinary commercial business,     Even
iiat this date German prisoners (of whom according to a statement of the Japanese Minister of War (Times, March 19) there are 94,000 in Siberia East of Lake Baikal and 60,000 West of the Lake) located at Omsk were being armed, and raw materials collected, presumably for transmission to Germany.     A later despatch from Sir William Greene (February 16) speaks of 26,COO German and Austrian prisoners as being armed and organised in the Tomsk district, while similar steps have been taken at Kharbin, Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk,The seizure of power in Siberia by the Bolsheviks has not, however, been accomplished without great loss in life and property throughout the country.   The assertion of their position indeed began previous to the formation of the Siberian Provisional Government * Circumstances like the results of the Vladivostok elections for the Constituent Assembly in November, in which they polled- almost half cf the total number of votes cast (15,000 out of 32,000) gave them a consciousness of power, and they initiated attempts to secure control in places so far removed as Omsk and Tashkent-,     These attempts always issued in fighting, in which Cossacks and Junkers (Cadet officers) ranged themselves with the representatives of the Russian Provisional Government -and later of the Siberian Provisional Government) against the Bolshevists.   The success of the latter was very varied in the beginning.   Thus at Kharbin the Chinese garrison arrested and disarmed the local Bolshevists at the instance of an Eastern Russian Committee formed for the preservation of order, but this failure carried with it an extension of their activities with extreme violence to other centres, until Irkutsk, Omsk, Krasnoyarsk, Tomsk, and other places passed under their con-trol.   By January the Bolsheviks were about equal in strength with the Moderates in Trans-Baikalia, although gaining ground on the whole elsewhere.   According to the latest news the situation is
j.almost completely in their hands, largely owing to their reported close association with the German and   Austrian prisoners of war, which is seriously significant, if true.     Another report (Sir John Jordan&apos;s telegram of March 18) refers to a statement by a French officer that the economic conquest of Silaeria bv the Germans is &quot;already virtually secured&quot;.   The policy pursued there by the Bolsheviks seems to have been identical with that followed in European Russia, viz. the reduction of all economic and social relations to a state of anarchy, which may give the Germans the opportunity to reconstruct affairs in their own interests, having acquired merit in the eyes of the local inhabitants as the restorers of order. &apos;The most recent events indicate the insufficiency ^f Semenofffs force (1500 Cossacks) to deal with the local situation.     So far from being able to advance on Chita he had evidently to withdraw from Karinskaya (junction of Amur and Siberian Railway) and even further to the East (to the proximity of the frontier station, Manchuria), owing to lack of artillery.19,5,18.
