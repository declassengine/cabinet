(1)20th March, 1918.SirjI beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production pepartment for the week ended 19th March:-The Weather.In consequence of the fine weather experienced almost universally large areas were both ploughed and sown during the past week.   The effect of moisture on newly sown crops more than compensated for the slight delay in ploughing caused by heavy rain falling in some counties on Tuesday.Area under Wheat.A compulsory return obtained on 1st February from individual occupiers of land in England and Wales shows that the area under wheat was 2,504,000 acres, as compared with 1,725,000 acres at the corresponding period last year, an increase of 45 per cent.   This is a very notable result of the Food Production  . Campaign, and gives ground for hope that, should the weather conditions continue to be favourable, the actual production of wheat at the 1918 Harvest will prove to be nearly half as much again as last year.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Work of Agricultural Executive Committees. Cambridgeshire.   The Committee have been authorised to take,   mm       r . m i i i n    f* , - - -.possession of and cultivate 65 acres of common land in the neighbourhood of Little Wilbraham upon which the rights of
pasture and of taking hay -are now exercised by a very small number of people,Essex-.   A farm of 133 acres at Boreham is let on lease at an excessive&quot;rent and is all in very poor grass.    It is stated that 100 acres on the farm ought to be cultivated.    The Committee having taken possession of 50 acres are mole-drainin it, and have been authorised to take possession of the rest. The Committee have also taken possession of 54 acres of clover marsh pasture at Tillingham.    The owner and occupier is serving In Australia, and his agent, not being in a position to carry out the cultivation on his behalf, has requested the Executive Committee to take possession.    The land has been let to a tenant at a low rent for breaking up. Kent.   The Committee have taken possession, with a view to letting a neglected farm of 80 acres near Rochester, the prope of a local charity.    Lullingstone Park, 600 acres in extent h been inspected by the District Committee in order to ascertain if any area eeruld be cultivated.    It was found to be impossib to cultivate the only part where the soil was good enough, owing to the number of trees upon it.Lincolnshire %   Holland.   A bad report on a farm of 150 acres at Donington was received in May 1917.    The Committee at that time refrained from taking possession, on the landlord&apos;s agsnt undertaking to see that the drainage was put.in order and the cultivation carried out.-    This undertaking has, however, not fulfilled, and the Committee now propose to take possession immediately and to cultivate the farm themselves. Suffolk %   West.   A farm of 90 acres at Beyton, &quot;part;. of whicn
Is owned by the occupier, has been under supervision on behalf of the Committee for about a year, but is still in a very backward state, and tho Committee have now decided to take possession and to cultivate the farm.     They have also taken possession of a 45 acre farm of wet heavy land at Elmswell with which the inexperienced tenant, who came into occupation at Michaelmas last, is quite unable to cope, and of a farm of 80 acres at Thelnetham, the cultivation of which has been going from bad to worse in spite of repeated warnings.In Kent the owner occupier of a farm of 103 acres near Tenterden was fined  75 and 10 guineas costs for failure to comply with an Order to plough up 21 acres of land which were once under tillage.     The only defence was that the Order was unreasonable and the Committee offered in Court to withdraw the summons if the defendant would give an undertaking to comply with the Order, but the undertaking was not given, A farmer at Market Brayton, Shropshire, was also fined  25 and 5 guineas costs for failure to comply with an Order to plough 62 acres before 10th January* 1918. Drainage - The East Riding Committee are carrying out the cleansing of the banks of the Derwent and the removal.of willows and other trees obstructing the stream where the occupiers had failed to do this work in compliance with notices issued under Paragraph (h) of Regulation 2M.     The work of cleaning out the Greenoak Goit has been completed and the ?/hole of the expense recovered from those interested.Damage by Game - Action under the Rabbits Order is reported from Hampshire, Somerset, East Suffolk and Warwickshire, and under the Rookeries Order from Cheshire.Determination of Tenancies - During the week 4 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 335 acres, and 3 Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 173
HORTICULTURAL DIVISION, Sunflower Growing,    There is every indication that a largo are of otherwise unused land will be planted with sunflowers, but a final decision with respect to the price to be paid for the crc has not yet been received from the Ministry of Pood, Fruit Section,   A gold medal was awarded for an exhibit of bottled and dried fruit and vegetables shown by the Department at the meeting of the Royal Horticultural Society during the past week.Sixty-seven demonstrations and lectures in fruit preserving have been given during the week. Provision of Land for Allotments,   Reports received from 1,127 districts show that 269,293 applications have been made for pic under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2), and that 242,066 plots containing 17,$84 acres have been provided.The Department have entered on part of the grounds attached to unoccupied dwelling houses in Godalmlng and Deptfo avid authorised the Town Councils to arrange for its cultivation allotments.The Allotment Inspectors visited 35 Local Authorities during the past week, and as the result of these visits the Authorities are taking steps to acquire an additional 438 acres of land (6,000 allotments).     At Camberwell 40 acres have been taken over (600 allotments), Hendon 36 acres (540 allotments), Edmonton 27 acres (405 allotments), Willesden 24 acres (360 allotments), Enfield 23 acres (345 allotments), at both Relgate and Wandsworth 21 acros (315 allotments).Allotments at Munition ftorks, Arrangements are being made for the employees of Munition Vjorks to extend the area under small cultivation.     It has been arranged for 200 of the women muniti
workers to start plots for the purpose of supplying the Works&apos; Canteen at Hayes, Middlesex,     The women work in squads of 20 or 30, and each squad will be under the charge of a forewoman.At Avonmouth, Bristol, 70 acres are being cultivated and a considerable area will be planted with early and second early potatoes.At the Ammon Works, Swindon, 11 acres have been divided Into plots, the men taking 10 rod plots and the womon 5 rod plots.The Army Agricultural Committee has made arrangements to encourage the cultivation of land attached to Aerodromes. Marketing.     A scheme is being prepared for the establishment of a Federation for marketing purposes of the six counties of North fales.     It is proposed that the Federation shall establish its principal Depot at Llandudno.The Marketing scheme for Warwickshire is making satisfactory progress, and arrangements have been made to facilitate transport,     A share capital of  2,000 has been raised.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Inspection of Land.     The Mid Kent Golf Course comprising 114 acres has been inspected and found to have been in grass only since 1908. The Course consists throughout of useful corn growing land which a country dependent on its agriculture would never allow to remain in grass, far less as a tract for recreational purposes.     The locality Is too dry for grass, but an average yield of 4j quarters of wheat per acre might reasonably be expected.     About 6 acres of the Course have already been cultivated for allotments, and the Club are quite willing to allocate more land for this purpose, but there is no further demand.     The cultivation of the entire Course would present no practical difficulties, and it is evident that there is here an appreciable potential contribution to the national food supply.

Plant Diseases. In connection with the investigations which are &quot;being carried out with regard to insect pests attacking cereal crc the larva of a fly, whioh has proved a serious pest on the Contin but has not hitherto been recognised as such in this country, ha3 been identified as the probable cause of injury to a field of whs in Hampshire!   In the course of the same inspection, it was ascertained that the Wheat Bulb Fly was the unsuspected cause of serious Injury to wheat.A visit has been paid to a large London firm of soap ma with reference to the. use for 3praying purposes of a soap made without oil or fat, and samples of the soap will be tested this sThe experiments conducted last season with tarred-felt discs as a protection against Cabbage Root Fly have proved on the whole successful.   It has been arranged for further trials to take place during the present season to confirm this result.LABOUR DIVISION. Soldier Labour.   An additional 400 of the ploughmen home from overseas on three months&apos; agricultural furlough were sent back to France during the week, leaving 647 men of this class still on the land.   Exclusive of these men, the number of-soldiers attached to depots to date Is 39,129 (27,303 skilled and 11,826 unskilled), o whom 35,363 (26,022 skilled and 9,341 unskilled) are out on farmsThe number of skilled soldiers still to be supplied to the Department under the Cabinet decision of the 27th June last, modified by the. recent agreement with the Military Authorities, i 2,205, and all these men can be made U3e of immediately they are supplied by the War Office.   In addition, large demands are being received for both skilled and unskilled men required for woi&apos;k connected with spring.cultivation.   Very large areas of ploughed land require to be sown and for this work additional labour is essential.An additional 131 soldiers were sent out during the weeK for training as tractor drivers and ploughmen, making a total of 3,577 men sent out for such training to date.
Horses*   Orders, for the-Issue, of 213 horses were given during &apos;the week, making a total of 6,561horses -supplied to date.   The Department have also received 931 horses on loan from the Military Authorities.prisoners of War.   An additional 12 prisoner camps (9 prisonerploughmen camps and three ordinary agricultural camps) have beenopened during the week, making the total number of prisoners nowemployed on the land as follows:-From 44 ordinary agricultural camps .....     4,470 &quot;   74 prisoner ploughmen camps      .....     2,652Employed from other camps .....     1,0088,1*30Released aliens employed on agriculture       1,647Total   ...   &quot;37777The number of schemes now under consideration by the WarOffice for the formation of agricultural camps is as follows50 prisoner ploughmen schemes .....     1,56330 ordinary agricultural schemes       .....     1,508Total   ...     3,071Apart from the above schemes, proposals are in hand forthe establishment of additional prisoner camps in districts whereagricultural labour is urgently required.   These schemes ares-45 prisoner ploughmen schemes .....     1,66026 ordinary agricultural schemes      .....    2,076Total    ...   &quot;3,656A large number of additional prisoners are required forurgent farm work, but the Department have no men available to meetthis demand.The War Office have been asked to supply 2,000 additional prisoners for agricultural work, but they have informed the Department that owing to the shortage of labour in France and the difficulty of transporting labour, caused by the lack of shipping facilities, it is impossible to supply any more prisoners for agricultural work in this country at the present time.   This creates a serious position, as unless additional skilled labour can be supplied from other sources, the progress of the Cabinetfs Food Production Programme will be gravely hampered.
A very successful demonstration was held in London yesterday the 19th inst.     140 members of the Women1 s Land Arnr; assembled with their banners outside these offices and marched procession to Trafalgar Square.     An effective part of the procession was a large wagon filled with straw and drawn by two powerful shire horses.     In Trafalgar Square a series of recrul meetings was held throughout the day.     Among the speakers were Lord Chaplin, General Morgan, Mr.Wiles, M.P., and two of the women Miss Painter, and Miss Gwynne Jones.     The procession for up again at 1,30 and went up the Mall to Buckingham Palace wher they wero received in the Great Court and inspected by Her Maje the Queen.     The women formed up In six rows, down which Her Majesty walked.     The Queen spoke to several of those present e expressed her appreciation of the fine work which women are doi at the present time as labourers on the land.     One of the rest of the demonstration was that 520 new recruits were enrolled during the day and further recruits are,, coming in in consider at numbers.The demand for labour now is greater than the availa supply, and volunteers are being booked several weeks ahead. Recruiting efforts are being made in various counties and earl reports are confirmed as to the better type of women volunteer now than was the case a year ago.In several counties recruiting has been undertaken in connection with the visit of the tanks to the larger towns; processions of Land Army women have marched through the street to the tanks and appeals have been made for more recruits.     T) demand for seasonal workers will be larger than in previous ye according to reports received from different parts of the countTraining centres in Northamptonshire and G-loucestersll are being enlarged to accommodate more pupils.     Seale &quot;Hayno
College in Devon, where a large number of Land Army women have hitherto been trained, has been commandeered by the Military Authorities for a hospital.The Buckinghamshire Tractor Representative has applied for 20 more women for work in that county and they are being placed this week. ,  In Wiltshire two women have had the entire charge of a Titan Tractor for several weeks, and during the four weeks ending March 10th ploughed 79 acres of land, thereby winning the champion flag for their unit.Efficiency tests have been held in Devon; for which there were 220 candidates, of whom only 12 failed to pass in the various subjects.     Tests have also been held in the North and V/est Ridings of Yorkshire.     In the West Riding there were three failures out of 55 entries, and in tho North Riding six out of 32 entries.The survey of the counties made by the Group Leaders is proving of great assistance in estimating the probable amount of labour required.     In Cambridge the returns show a demand for 300 women from outside the county.7,136 women are accounted for as members of the Land Army as followsj-In Instruction Centres............... 356On Farm Work......................... 5,867Employed by Forage Committee.,....... 453&quot;        &quot;   Timber Department........ 98Waiting for references to be placedin Training Centres.............. 115Waiting in Depots.................... 40Waiting in their own homes........... 2Q7

&apos; Essex.   A Titan of the Southend Unit cultivated 00 aores in a six day week, working in seven different fields on three different farms.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Fertilisers.   Conferences are being held with the Ministry of Munitions in regard to the prico to be fixed f^r tho ensuing year for sulphate of ammonia and superphosphate.    Owing to the increase in the prico of sulphuric acid, very serious increases in the price of these two fertilisers will be necessary in order to cover the cost of manufacture, and it is feared that food production may be seriously interfered with owing to farmers trying&apos; to economise in the use of these fertilisers.     It seems also that heavy increase   would give rise to claim? for higher maximum prices generally for agricultural produce. Sulphate of Ammonia.   The deliveries of sulphate of ammonia for agricultural use in February amounted to 23,500 tons as compared with about 20,000 tons in the same month last ye*r*    Stock at the worke is now only 14,000 tone, and ai there are about 650 works this means that the stocks are practically exhausted all round.    Orders for 45,000 tons are in hand for delivery during the remaining three months, and if these are supplied it will bring the total deliveries for the year 1917-18 up to 209,000 tons.Superphosphate. Deliveries of superphosphate amount to 56,000 tons&apos; as&apos; against only 32,000 tons in the same month last year. Deliveries of compound manures were also good at 62,000 tons as against 65,000 tons last year.Some difficulty is being experienced by allotment holders in obtaining supplies of small quantities of these fertilisers, end it has been suggested t* the Ministry of Munitions that a short Order should be issued allowing dealers to make an additional charge for quantities from 14 lbs. tolcwt.
In order to encourage them to offer superphosphate. Basic Slag.   The proposed prices for next season have been submitted to a Sab-Committee of the makers, and accepted by the practically without protest.     The proposed arrangements for distributing itere also discussed.The deliveries for the four weeks of February amount! to 40*000 tons, which is practically equivalent to the producti Stocks at most of tho works are quite insignificant, except at Middlesborough where difficulties in delivery still occur. ffilat South African Maize. Arrangements have been made for the: distribution of this maize and several orders have already hem received and executed.Soed 0at3. 1. 4anx OatSt The Departments stocks are at preseri exhausted.2. Irish Oats.   Amount bought 17,285 quarters. Amount sold 14,731 Quarters.     About 500 tons of Irish black Tartarian Oats are likely to arrive before the end of ^arch.3. Scottish Qats. Amount bought 4,405 quarters.amount sold 2,771 quartersAbout 3,500 quarters of ianx Abundance seed oats havbeen shipped from Liverpool for the use of the Armies in FrancA further consignment of 2,500 quarters is ready for shipmentand a further offer has been submitted to the Director ofAgricultural Production in France to supply from 1,500 to 2,0quarters of Scottish seed.Potatoes. Seed Supply. The position with regard to the pot at seed supply may be summarised as followsi-Orders received end accepted from Agricultural Execu Committees; public bodies, allotment societies, approved agent and individual farmers amount approximately to 19,000 tons of which approximately 8,000 tons have been delivered. The. fir cargo of 1,000 tons of Irish &apos;seed&apos; for distribution in Er^lan and Wales is at present on passage in one of the new standard ships which is making her maiden voyage.
The total requirements of the Armies in Prance amount to 15,300 tons, of which 5,241 have already &quot;been shipped.During the past week deliveries to consignees in England and Wales have amounted to over 250 tons a day, and, in addition, regular consignments have been going forward for shipment to Leith, Belfast and Grimsby.     While this rate of delivery shows an improvement on that of previous weeks, it is necessary that it should be further increased, In order that the potatoes may be got forward for planting as soon aa possible, as weather conditions are so exceptionally favourable.     The Department are enlisting further assistance from the Railway Executive Committee in this matter.Latest advices from Ireland indicate that there is considerable difficulty in getting forward further supplies of &apos;&apos;seed owing to the fact that consignments of ware for South Wales are not being removed as quickly as was anticipated and the ports and railways are consequently congested.Wart Disease.   Reports Indicate that occupiers of land scheduled for wart disease have made arrangements for obtaining their supplies of &quot;seed&quot; of resistant varieties without serious trouble. There is some difficulty in the case of resistant first early varieties, owing to the limited quantity available, and this difficulty may also be experienced in the next year or two until sufficient supplies cf first early &quot;immunes&quot; can be raised.     Tho Department^ scheme for growing under contract should assist in solving the question of providing first earlies, but meanwhile it is proposed, under the new Wart Diseaso Order, to permit the planting of first early susceptible varieties in certain cases under the authority of a licence issued by an Inspector of the Department.
Arrangements are being made for conducting the usual variety tests for immunity from wart disease in connection with potatoes submitted for trial in 1918.   Demonstration plots are a; being laid out in centres throughout the country wherever wart disease is prevalent.Materials for Potato Spraying.   In view of the increased area u potatoes and the spraying campaign, the question of the quantity copper sulphate required has been reconsidered and provision is fl being made for 18,000 tone to be reserved as against a total salj of about 11,000 tons last year.   The sales for agricultural use season have now amounted to 7,000 tons, which shows that merehan and dealers are placing their orders unusually early.In the case of soda crystals, it has been arranged witl the manufacturers for the sale at a fixed delivered price in quantities of 1 ton and over.     The makers have also undertaken give priority to any orders for supplies for agricultural purpossI am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General,The Rt. Hon. Rowland E.
