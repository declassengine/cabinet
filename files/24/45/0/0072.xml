Colonel -Jones(This Document Is the Property ofHis Britannic; Majesty^ Government.)18th March1918.This :Report is divided into three parts, (1) a &quot;brief account cf imports, entrances and clearances, shipping losses, employment of ships and now construc-tion in the last month for which figures are available (2) a comment on some recent development and (3) a discussion in relation to imports and a note cn exports.1.       In February total imports into the United Kingdom amounted to 2,559,000 tons, an increase of 4  on February 1917 and a decrease of % on February 1916, and of 3bJo on February 1913.   In connection with the increase as against February 1917, it should be remembered that a great fall occurred in that month owing to tho start of the unrestricted submarine compaign.   In January, imports showed a decrease of 19^ compared with those of January 1917. 2.       while imports were down 33  in 1913, the entrances of British and Foreign vessels (with cargo) were down oC ; and while imports were up 4  on 1917 tonnage entrances were down Thus, as against 1913 the loading factor hadimproved by 34^ and as against 1917 by 13^.H. STANLEY.m mm oy soam isia
3.       In February, British entrances with cargo (other than requisitioned vessels) amounted to 1,358,000 net tons - IQp less than in January 1917,    The percentage of fall was % in the previous month, British clearances (other than requisitioned vessels) were 974,000 tons - \% less than in February 1917, compared with a decrease of Zcfi in January.   Foreign entrances amounted to 315,000 tons, 3  less than in February 1917 - as against a decline of 59$ in the previous month - and foreign clearances to 619,000 tons, 44^ less than in February 1917.    The remarkably small figure of 3^ for the contraction fh foreign entrances is, of course, due to the fact that in February 1917 foreign entrances were enormously reduced in consequence of the new submarine compaign.4.      In February total losses of snipping, of over 500 G.T. amounted to 271,000 gross tons of which 225,000 tons were due to war risk.      This happens to be exactly the figure estimated by the Admiralty last November as the average monthly loss by war risk for the seven succeeding months.    The figures for December and January were 236,000 and 188,000 respectively, so that for the three months war losses are just on the light side of the estimate.As regards gains, the position is different.    The Watson-Elder ton estimate of October 30th 1917 allowed for. gains through building at home and purchase of new vessels abroad of 155,000 tons in January and 139,000 in February.   The actual figures reached are 71,000 tons in January and 104,000 in February, or about 60r of the es-timate for the two months.Total gains in February, including&apos; 6,000 tons requisitioned under the Norwegian agreement, amounted to
115,000 tons:   so that the net loss was 156,000 tons, which is practically the same figure as in December and January.War losses of the Allies (other than British) in February were 51,000 tons as against 87,000 in January and of neutrals 32,000 tens as against 35,000 in January.Comparing the three months September-November with December-February we find that total world losses have fallen 100,000 tons from 1,100,000 to l,O0QOCO roughly, and that this decrease is almost exactly accounted for by decrease in Allied sinkings, British and Neutral remaining stationary.      The percentage of British to total loss has risen from 61% in February-April 1917 to 65% in December-February 1918.5.       On January 31st. - the figure for February  28this not yet available - as compared with December 31st.the employment of the British Mercantile steam fleet over500 tons had changed as followsCHANGE IN fllff TONNAGE. fflSVessels repairing in dry dock I   94,000Launched but not completed /   61,000Total of the above :- / 155,000Army and Navy - 105,000Colonies - 116,000Allies 7 71,000Permanently abroad f,   48*9^Oilers /  16,000 Remainder available for British tradeother than oilers f   36,000 w.Total ready for uso &apos;   - 190,000Grand Total : -  35^000It thus appears that during January in spite of a ial\ of 190,000 tons in the total of tonnage fit for service, the part available for U.K. trade has actually
risen by 38,000 tons, thanks to a reduction in the amount employed by the Services, the Allies and the Colonies.The table below gives the absolute and the percentage increases and decreases of vessels over 1,600 tons that have taken place between January 31st 1917 and January 31st 1918 in the several employments of :-	Tons	PercentageRepairing in dry dock Launched but not completed	/625,00G f252,000	/ 477 f 203Total;	/S?7,000	f 344Army and Navy Colonies Allies Permanently abroad Oilers Remainder available for U.k. trade other than oilers	-392,000 -544,000 -599,000 -283,090 / 63,000 -1,226,000	- 10 - 46 - 35 - 21 /    6 - 17Total ready for use:	-2,921,000	-  18Grand Total:	-2,044,000	-   12The most striking feature of this Table is that owing to the enormous increase that has taken place in the tonnage of vessels that are out of use undergoing repair in dry dock, a reduction of 12p in the total on the register lias meant a reduction of tonnage fit fox service of as much as 18^. Owing to the withdrawal of vessels iu the seivice of Allies Colonies and permanent tra;.e aoroad, it has been found pos-ible to koep do--n tha reduction in the tonnage available for British trade (other than oilers) to roughly 1* millions tons out of a total effective reduction of nearly 3 million tons,   rlainly, however, a reduction of 17-. in the total of vessels employed in tho U.K. trade, a total already enormously diminished below the figure for normal times is an exceedingly serious matter.6.      The following Table sho-s the position of British
shipUuIcing as reported during the week ending 7th March 1918:(BQoS TQNMg. .Under Con-       Launched       Total under struction        hut not        construe-on stocks.       completed tion.Standard shins 489,000 38,000        527,000Other Merchant vessels 527,000 332,000      &apos; 859,000Oilers 287,000 49,000        336 0001,303,000 419,000     1,722,000The tonnage under construction on stocks included 78 over* seas barges totalling 25,000 tons.,    On tho tonnage of &quot;other merchant vessels1&apos;, 103,000 tons are ships for carrying meat and fruit.     The total tonnage under construction is some 8,0Q0 tons less than a month before: but the tonnage of standard ships has increased by nearly 60,000 tons.During the last week of March, 143, merchant vessels of 512,000 tons were being repaired in dry dock, and 218 of 768,000 tons in all were being repaired afloat. Thus the total tonnage undergoing repair was just over 1% million gross tons, or nearly 200,000 tons less than a month ago.omm oa some msmi mmmmLThe Committee on.Import Restrictions have made  -recommendations (February 11) as to the way in which the contraction of imports made necessary by the Shipping shortage to the extent of a further 2 million tons over and above the reductions of 5  million tons already
recommended shall be met.    Their recommendation is that reductions shall be made as follows:-New reduction Total reductionTons.    .. on 1917.

reductions may ba expected to have serious effects on industry, upon which it will be necessary to keep careful watch.    Already, in view of tho fact feat paper suuulies have been so far reduced as to make regulation in detail imperative, a Controller of Paper has been appointed. In the American section of the Cotton industry tho percentage! of machinery working in mills still active has been cut down from 60 to 50 par cent, with the usual concessions for Government work.    This may be regarded as tho bottom limit as few mills could run with less than 50 per cent, of their machinery in operation.    It is eroected that unemployment will be increased by 75,000 in consequence.In the munition industries also unemployment has appeared.    It has been necessary to dismiss a number of women munition workers and it has boon estimated that the proposed cut may ultimately involve the dismissal of 1C0.0C0 or 120,000 workers.     sere arc other forms of war work, such as aeroplane making that may be expected to absorb a number of these workers, but it is not likely that very many c&amp;n be employed by other metal industries, particularly in view of the shortage of materials.    It must be remembered, however, that many of the women discharged were only engaged temporarily and had been earning little or nothing before they took on munition work.    Still there can be no doubt that any extensive policy of dismissals must raise very sorious difficulties.
The following	notes on stocks	have been	compiled with special reference to		the fact that	importsof all goods except food and muniti		ens will he a	t aminimum in March and April.			Timber.	Imports in Janua	ry and February	have been heavy so	that the stock o	osition is be	ttor thanmight have been anticipated at the		end of 1917.

Imports have been a good deal above the estimate for the whole of 1918 (40,000 tons a month).   It was anticipated that this might be necessary in the early months of the year.   Stocks are good except in South Wales.  Apart from the South Welsh pits (largely Admiralty) very little imported wood is being used anywhere.(b) Softwood, sawn, etc.   Stock figures for tho end of Fobruary are not yet available; but the imports plus the estimated home production almost equal the present estimated consumption for the two months. Stocks should therefore not have been much depleted-, which at . this time of year is unusual.   The figures available for January confirm this view.   That is to say the stockin hand at the beginning of March (including a certainamount(a)STOCKS IN RJLATIOK TO IMPOSTS.
9 Q 6 0 damount of home grown timber held by the railwaysand not distinguished) should be nearly 5 months1 supply.(c)   Karflwood. ^ The heavy import reflects the naval and military demand.   Stocks are nominal, and havo been so for a long time.. ,Cotton.     Stocks of Egyptian Cotton are satisfactory, a-iDuntihg to rather more than 20 weeks consumption.   But stocks of American arc by no means satisfactory in view of the reduced import decided upon.   They amount to about 12 weeks&apos; consumption at the reduced rate.   It is estimated that by the end of the year stocks will bo down to a littlemore than a fortnights supoly (an impossibly smallCox&quot;)working margin) if stocks of other  sorts of cotton are not substituted for American to a material extent despite the obstacles in the way. vfool. Th8 imports in January-Fobruaryamounted to something like 6 weeks1 consumption at present rates.   As the stock was 5-6 months&apos; supply on January 1. it is therefore now about 5 months1. Flax. There has been a small import inJanuary-February (1,000 tons).   No immediate problem arises as there are still some months&apos; flax in hand, but the prospects for the second half of the year remain perfectly obscure.Hemp. Imports have been satisfactory andtho stock position is for the present safo. Jute, The position.is rather delicate.Stocks had been run down to 2-3 months on January 1. To keep the industry well, but not quite fully, employed for the year, about 16,000 tons a month are required. The import for January-February was 26,000 tons.   If a serious gat* in imports comes tn March-April theindustry
industry will be running very near the edge for the rest of the year  aid any accident may put it out of work for a time.Farinaceous Products for Textile Industries.     These cannot all be separated from the farinaceous products imported by the Ministry of Food and released for making starch, siae, etc     Those that oan be so separated   are starch, dextrine and farina.     Stocks are known to be very low and complaints about the reduced import have recently been numerous; but, fortunately,-the Jan.-Feb. import was rather greater this year than in 1917 (18 ,000 as against 170,000 cwts./) Rosin. The rosin shortage has only recentlymade itself felt.     The minimum import required for 1918 will be about 5,000 tons a month as against an average of 7,000 tons imported in 1917.     In January and February together only 3,500 tons arrived.     Unless the 5,000 tone can be secured in March and April the situation especially in the soap and paper trades, will become very difficult; though French supplies, which are certain to arrive, are sufficient for the munitions and certain other essential demands.Rubber. Stocks were large on January 1. and theJanuary-February import has fallen only about 9f0 below that of January-February 1917,    Moreover the re-export liabilities have fallen off - Russia no longer being N supplied and the U.S.A. drawing more of her supplies direct.Cork. The question of the supply of corkfor the linoleum industry remains critical.     All the cork that it ha^ been found possible to ship in recent months has been for naval uses, and the Ministry of \ Shipping do not see any likelihood of cork for civilian purposes being imported in the near future in any considerable quantity although the
linoleum industry is seriously threatened. Hides and Skins, present no serious problem.   There are considerable stocks and a good home supply. A gap in imports might be inconvenient but should not be dangerous. Iron and ,gteel. The naval and munitions demandscombined with the tonnage position have greatly increased the pressure on civilian metal using industries.   Steel Sheet and Tinplate are exceedingly scarce and industry is suffering from acute shortage of containers, of all kinds.   Minor tin-plate using trades (e.g.the mechanical toy trade) are in danger of complete suspension.   The hollowware, bedstead, gas meter, electric-light fittings, plumbing, sewing machine, perambulator and many other trades have been rationed with steel.  Steel wire, is, for the moment, tighter than steel sheet, so that even important industries have to go short.   The supply of good new wire for pianos, spring mattresses, hair-ins, etc., has been stopped and in some cases ?rejectr wire is hardly procurable.   A fair supply for needles and pins is with difficulty maintained.   There is however some prospect of improvement in the wiro position in a few months. )RTS.The total value of exports was  39 million as against  42 million in January (3 days longer). Cotton manufactures accounted for slightly over a third of the total value.   As compared with February 1917 they had increased in weight from about 85,000 to 93,000 tons.   In woollen yarns and goods, ho /ever, the February figures showed a considerable falling off in quantity compared with a year ago.   Owing to shortage of shipping space for certain markets ij has been found necessary to ration the freight available forexoort(id
export to these markets of Cotton and Woollen textile manufactures,/ and an advisory committee has recently been established for this purpose by the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Shipping in conjunction.    This Committee, called the textile Exports Shipping Committee is composed of representatives nominated by the Chambers of Commerce of the chief cotton and woollen manufacturing centres.1!ABLE I.
