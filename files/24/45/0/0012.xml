a, 34Intelligence Bureaudepartment of Information,ETW/005.WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   TURKEY andOTHER HCSLEM COUNTRIES.(March 12th,  1918)(I)Armenian Atrocities against Moslems.The advance of the Turkish Army on the Armenian ?ront &quot;continues slowly.     It is apparently being carried out by small parties of regulars and hands of Kurds.     The re-oceujbation of Erzerum and Van is not yet announced, but is evidently imminent.     The Armenians have failed to organise a regular armym and the men armed with the equipment of the disbanded Russian forces have simoly gathered into guerrilla bands, incapable of holding up the Turks., but ready enough, unfortunately, to commit atrocities against the Moslem population of the successive districts from which they have to retreat.These atrocities, which were resorted by the Turkish Government as early as the beginning of February, are no,-.* confirmed by the British military representatives in the Caucasus.     More than  00 Moslems are stated (in a War Office telegram dated Tiflis SIoSa .18) to have been massacred by the Armenians at Erzingan.There is no evidence that the Armenian national authorities,either at Tiflis or in the Occuoied Territories, are in any way responsible, and in this respect, as in that of scale and provocation, these Armenian atrocities cannot be compared with the Turkish atrocities of 1915,     At the same time, the Turks have now an exoellent oretext for continuing their advance, for exterminating the surviving Armenian &quot;copulation, and for demanding &quot;permanent political guarantees&quot; for all Moslem elements in Armenia.and Trans-Caucasia.
Turkish Designs in Russia.The clause in the final treaty &quot;between the Central Powers and Russia, providing for the cession by Russia of the Trans-Caucasian districts annexed by her from Turkey in 1878, was mentioned in the last Report.This is obviously a &quot;disannexation&quot; from the Turkish point of view, hut Germany objects to that formula on account of Alsace-Lorraine, and the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; therefore explains the clause on the principle of &quot;self-determination&quot;.As in Courland etc., Russia renounces interference, and then the local population is to settle its destiny &quot;in agreement with&quot; the Central Powers - in this case, that is, with&apos; the Turkish Government.In the ICars-Ardahan district (inland) there is a Moslem majority of Turks and Kurds (perhaps 120,000 together) and a Christian minority of (perhaps 30,000) Armenians.There is also a Moslem majority in the coastal district of Batum, hut the port itself has a mixed population and the Moslem peasantry are Georgians by language and race.Since the beginning of the Revolution, the Christian Georgians have made great efforts to secure the Moslem members of their race for the Georgian national movement.     On Dec. 24th, 1917, the Georgian National Council published an appeal to Georgian Moslems, offering them political autonomy (with a iocal capital at Batum) within the Georgian national state;    the control of their own schools, justice, militia and local administration; provision of I     technical schools, bursaries, co-operative societies, medical 1     officers;    and even medress&amp;s for Moslem theological students.This generosity was prompted by the propaganda which the Tatarsh&apos; f    of Trans-Caucasia had been conducting among the Georgian Moslems. How the inclinations of the latter have been affected by these
different advances it is impossible to say, but obviously the Turkish Government intends to decide their allegiance for them.On March 6th the signature of the treaty with Russia, and apparently an outline of its terms, was announced in the Ottoman Parliament.     A deputy is stated to have contrasted Turkey&apos;s omission &quot;to obtain guarantees for the Turkish population in Bussia in the light for self-government&quot; with Germany&apos;s stipula-tions with regard to Esthc-nia, UJivonia and Finland,Snver ?asha is stated to have replied that &quot;the Bolsheviks has&quot; already proclaimed the right of self-determination for all neonles, end that the Ottoman Government won!d net fail to recognise the autonomous governments already establishes in the Caucasus, as also those set up in the neighbourhood of Turkey, all of Which the Turkish Government was prepared to support if necessary&quot;.Clearly Turkey does not consider herself precluded by the peace with Russia from extensive interventions in .the South and South-east of the former Russian Empire, and will justify them as Germany is justifying her further intervention in the West,Probably the Turks expect to annihilate the Armenians, and reokon that Georgia, in her isolation, will reconcile herself to the sac-rifice of her lloslem districts and of the port of Batum,An agent reports on Feb.  28th that Persia hes usked Turkey and Germany for the Province (formerly KhavCate) of ^rivan, ^hich Russia annexed fro- her in 1826.     Oemany is declared to have agreed to this on condition that the Persian Government eliminates British influence from Southern Persia, disbands the South Dersian Rifles, and grants Germany economic concessions.On the other hand,  the Armenian ^ress quotes a Teheran journal as announcing the discovery of a secret society working at Tiflis for the autonomy of the Persian Province of Azerbaijan under Ottoman
suzerainty.     The inhabitants of Azerbaijan speak the same Turkish dialect as the Tatars of T&amp;ans-Caucasia, and the secret society is presumably a &quot;Pan-Turanian&quot; organisation.     If there is any truth in this rumour, it would make excellent pro-Entente propaganda in Persia. Persia.Sir C.Marling repeated on March 4th that, whereas three months ago the Persian Democratic Party was both united &amp;ng definitely anti-British it &quot;was now divided, and that one section was inclin-ing towards good relations with Great Britain.On the other hand, three P^Bsian notables recently arrivec in Berlin, declared, according to the German Press of March 8th, that the Democratic Party was &quot;greatly strengthened&quot;,   possibly this statement was bluff;   at any rate it appears to have been out of date.The fighting between the Assyrian Volunteers and PersianCossacks at Ui;mia has ended in a temporary victory for the former.The Assyrians have &quot;committed excesses&quot;, and the Moslems arebeing disarmed.     But fighting is expected to break out again,and since the Assyrians are in r tiny minority and lie in thepath of the Turkish advance, tfcey are probably doomed.Vice-Consul and the It is now known that the Jangalis have carried off the British/Bank Manager at Resht.     So far neither Bolsheviks nor Jangalis have advanced on Kasvin, but on March 8th Sir. C, Marling trans-mi t-ted a report that such an advance was considered imminent. Enemy officers (liberated Austrian prisoners or Turks?) are said to have arrived at Kasvin already.The situation is complicated by fighting, reported from Astara, between different bodies of Russian troops, and by the disquietude of Russians with established interests in northern Persia at the
\      prospect of British intervention.     The Russian officers of the Persian Cossacks are stated by Sir C. Marling to he affected by this feeling.    It is ominous that they should still he thinking in terms of Russo-British rivalry at a moment when the&quot;vested interests&quot; of both nations in Persia are being threatened with extinction by the Turkish advance, the attitude of the Persian Government and the conduct of the Bolsheviks on the Caspian coast. (4)   Syrian Sympathies.Telegrams from Sir R. Wingate at Cairo (March 1st) and General Clayton at Jerusalem (March 5th) alike indicate that Syrian opinion is hardening both against France and against Zionism.     The result-seems to have been to draw Christian and Moslem Syrians together (at any rate in the Syrian colony in Egypt).     Many Christians as well as Moslems would be willing to accept King Hussein&apos;s son Faisal as an independent constitutional ruler, hut Moslems avow their preference for Turkey if the alternative is France.It would be important to know the effect upon Syrian opinion of M. Pichon&apos;s statement to M. Sokolow that, on the Palestinian question, the British and French Governments are in completenaccord. (5)   Movements In German Jewry.The Jewish organisations in Germany have amalgamated into a &quot;Union of Jewish Organisations in Germany for safeguarding the rights of Jews in the East&quot;.Steps are being taken to affiliate other Jewish organisations in Germany, and to found similar unions in Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria.     It is announced In a statement to the press that &quot;the -Association has been formed to represent the opinion of German Jewry with regard to all the Jewish problems which may arise in the East both now, during the war, and at the peace Conference.&quot;The following principles for the treatment of Jewish Problems
in the East and in the Ottoman Empire have been laid down as aresult of the activities of the Association :-(1) Legal and actual equality for Jews, with,all the rights -and duties of citizens.(2) Religious freedom.(3) The right to an independent Jewish culture.(4) The right to free immigration and to economic activities in.all parts of the Ottoman Empire.(5) The right to free immigration and to cultural autonomy in Palestine&quot;.The derman Z-ionist^Organisation is one of the few bodies.af-filiated to the Union, but its organ, the &quot;Jtldische Runaschan&quot;, states, (what is obvious, from the programme just quoted) that the initiative came from the anti-Zionist organisations, and that the Zionists were only admitted under pressure of the situation.The programme is obviously a minimum from the Zionist point of vie?;, and the last two clauses are perfunctory additions to the fi:.st three, which concern the status of Jews, not in Palestine but in the former &quot;Jewish Pale&quot; of the Russian Empire and in Rumania.While the British advance in Palestine has deprived Germany ofdirect control over the destinies of Zionism, the German advance iin Russia, beyond the line reached in 1915, is bringing the whole of East European Jewry within the German sphere.As the essential reservoir for Palestinian colonisation, East European Jewry is of vital importance for Zionist aspirations. The Germans made effective propaganda out of the deportation of Jews from the evacuated territories by the Tsar&apos;s -Government in 1915, but took little pains then to conciliate Jewish opinion. In the new municipal institutions which they created in Poland, they sacrificed Jewish securlty-to Polish^jiati^malisiii^^ut -wirthjtbe exton?ion of thoir conquests in Eastern.- Europe and the increase of their power, their policy shows signs of undergoing a change.
a logical consequence of their recent alienation of the Poles for the sake of the Ukrainians would he the support of Jewish claims in the Polish area, for the Poles are a formidable enough power to make it advisable for Germany, when once she has alienate them, to secure all the allies against them that she can find.In Rumania, too, there are rumours that the Central Powers in-tend to insert stipulations in favour of Jewish rights in the f&amp;aoe^treaty.The conciliation of the Yiddish-speaking Jews of Eastern Europe as a German &quot;culture asset&quot; has been preached by the conservative-Zionist German-Jewish publicist Dr. Davis-Trietsoh since the be-ginning of the War*     It appaars that the German Government is at last adopting his policy.     On March 8th the German Wireless circulated a rumour (quoted from the &quot;Temps&quot;) that the Bolshevik Government at Petrograd has suspended all Jewish newspapers and arrested their editors, as well as the Chairman of the Organisation Committee of the forthcoming Russian Jewish Congress.      If this is true, it plays int*s Germany&apos;s hands, and it is in the new German dependencies in Eastern Europe, rather than in the Ottoman Empire, that the most serious counter-offensive to British Zionist policy is to be expected. Io)    Turkish Internal Affairs,Javid Bey, the Minister of Finance, spoke in Parliament on Feb. 213t about the Budget for the coming year.. He is reported to have stated that the deficit, including the extraordinary military expenses, would amount to IT 14.000.COO; but a forecast in the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; of Feb. 9th estimated this deficit as ordinary expenditure, and  he arrangements for loans discussed by Javid in the latter part of his speech make \      this reading the more likely&apos;one.
Jatrid Bey announced incidentally that the total war expenditure of Turkey up to- date was LT 230 millions, of which LT 128 millions had been spent during the last year ( a significant increase in the rate of expenditure).     The whole of this expenditure had&apos; been covered by loans from Germany and Austria-Hungary, and as TurkeyTs pre-war debt amounted only to LT 155 millions, it follows that at the end of the war Germany will hold an overwhelming share of the total national debt of Turkey..Javid expres;si;d&quot;an expectation tjrat up to LT 40.000.000 of the loan&quot;-for, &apos;tjie. coming yeas- cbuld&apos; be subs crib oi by Turkish capital&apos; Native Turkish..Kkapital-kraft&quot; has been much advertised lately, and there is a bcoin In. Turkish company-promo ting.     Whether&apos;-this has any solid foundation ot is mere economic chauvinism remains uncertain.On jfari 8th a bill was introduced into the Turkish Parliament for -the administrative reorganisation of Northern Mesopotamia. The intention was to secure greater governmental control of the country, and to protect agriculture against nomadism.     The Government frankly admitted the unsatisfactoriness of present conditions,     Possibly the British occupation of Southern Mesopotamia has seriously shaken Ottoman prestige in the Horth, and this is an attempt to restore it.
