Colonel Jones.                                                                                   (This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)                            G.T. 3908                                                                                     The Air Council desire a decision of the War Cabinet on the question of continued assistance to the Norwegian Government in the matter of aviation. The Air Council have before them at the moment various questions arising in this regard, as for example the propriety of selling to the Norwegians disused aeroplanes, the supply of drawings of certain types of aeroplanes to the Norwegians, and the question of receiving more Norwegian pilots for training. Facilities have been given to the Norwegian Government in the past in the way of training a small number of pilots, supplying drawings of aeroplanes and in a few cases complete aeroplanes. The Air Council understand that this policy is based on a decision of the War Cabinet and arose mainly out of the consideration that Norway would probably be driven into the war on the side of the Allies. The ground for the decision appears to have been profoundly modified by recent events in the Baltic. The Air Council so far as they are concerned are adverse to continuing assistance to the Norwegian Government in any of the directions already indicated. It appears to them, for example, that if Norwegian pilots have the benefit of training in the United Kingdom there is a risk amounting almost to a certainty that Germany will obtain particulars of this training.     There is the same risk in respect of provision of aeroplane drawings or aeroplanes and in the case of out-of-date aeroplanes there is the consideration that these contain metals and other constituents which would certainly be of value to the enemy and which are better kept at home or at all events if disposed of, sent to neutral countries outside Europe.The Air Council would invite a decision by the War Cabinet on this question. 12 MAR 1918 (Signed) ROTHERMERE.
