Mural Decorationsat theForeign OfficeDESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT BYTHE ARTIST

MY offer to decorate one of H.M. Government    buildings was prompted by a speech delivered by His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury at the Royal Academy Banquet on May 4th, 1912. He contrasted the drab, uninspiring surroundings in which the officials of H.M. Government had to carry on their work with the artistic achievements adorning the walls of public buildings abroad, and appealed to the public spirit of his hearers to help to remove this reproach.H.M. Government having expressed appreciation of my offer, the site was selected, and I was invited to outline my scheme. In November, 1912,1 submitted my ideas for a suitable decorative scheme to Earl Beauchamp, H.M. First Commissioner of Works, who, having expressed his approval, requested me to prepare preliminary sketches on a larger scale. In Spring, 1914, the colour sketches were sufficiently advanced to be placed in an architectural model (scale: 1 inch = 1 foot), fitted with electric light, and complete in all details for showing the scheme in its proper setting. It was understood that I &quot; agreed to bear all expenses in connection with this work and that no cost was to fall on public funds.&quot;At Lord Beauchamp&apos;s request the model was on exhibition at the Foreign Office for six weeks, &quot; to give an opportunity for the officials and for any member of Parlia-ment who may like to look at the designs to see them.&quot;The scheme met with the approval of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Edward Grey (now Viscount Grey of Fallodon), who inspected the model with Lord Beauchamp. At the request of the Prime Minister, Mr. Asquith, it was transferred to 10, Downing Street, to be submitted to the Cabinet Council on May 13 th,
1914- My offer was accepted by H.M. Government; and on the same day Lord Beauchamp, in the name of the Prime Minister and of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, commissioned me to carry out the proposed scheme.From start to finish, the completion of the decorations took seven years, to the entire exclusion of all other work. It had been settled with Lord Beauchamp that each picture on completion should be placed in situ. But, owing to the War, the Foreign Office required every wall space available, and I was accordingly asked, when the first panel was finished in November, 1914, to postpone the fixing of the panels in situ till the War was over. All were ready by Armistice Day, &quot;Britannia Pacificatrix&quot; excepted.London,Oct., 1921.
Descriptive Account of the Mural Decorations.THE paintings depict the origin, education, development, expansion and triumph of the British Empire, leading up to the Covenant of the League of Nations, the names of the thirty-two original signatories of the League adorning the arches of the corridors on which the mural decorated-tions are placed.i.BRITANNIA SPONSA.This picture represents the seafarers or successive waves of oversea tribes landing to obtain possession of Britannia, conceived as a wild, fair-haired shepherd girl, and the withdrawal of an earlier and ruder race. The vision of the Angel between the two groups holding the chalice (an echo of the Glastonbury Legend) represents the spirit of Christianity. In the foreground the Roman occu-pation is hinted at in the broken fragments of classical architecture amongst the irises, and the white cliffs of Albion fill up the middle distance.2.BRITANNIA NUTRIX.The Bride becomes the Mother, and, in the Spring-time of the race, the Arts of Peace are represented by Ploughing, Music, Pottery, Spinning, Reading, etc. But, above all, the rearing of a sturdy race of children and the mother&apos;s devotion are emphasized  Britain the Motherland.
BRITANNIA BELLATRIX.Britannia is teaching her sons those bodily exer-cises and manly sports which will fit them to take their part in v/ar should it come. It is not &quot;Warfare&quot; but the &quot;Art of War&quot; which is being inculcated. In contrast with the gay, light treatment of the &quot; Nutrix &quot; panel, the tall pines and subdued tones of the figures are in sympathy with the sterner trials of life.4-BRITANNIA MATER COLONORUM.The subject of this picture is the spirit of the expansion of the race overseas. The mother of the colonists holds the trident aloft ; she has won it fairly, and she sends forth her sons to seek their fortunes. The ruling passion holds even the little ones, who in the foreground launch their tiny boat upon the waves.5-BRITANNIA  PACIFICATRIX.The original conception of this picture was inspired by Great Britain being the first Great Power to propose and carry through a general Arbitration Treaty. The grasping of the &quot; hands across the sea&quot; of the two great English-speaking races, Great Britain and the United States of America, seemed, in the artist&apos;s imagination, to be the-fittest conclusion of his whole theme, and the other panels were severally designed to lead up to this.The War has, indeed, caused great changes in the details of the final composition, but the main idea subsists, that having won her position in the world,
Britannia&apos;s influence is for Peace, and that her sons, whom she has sent in distant lands, are ready to return to the Motherland, and with counsel and aid be at her side.Happily  the  diplomatic   re-grouping  of the nations did not cause serious artistic difficulties.In the centre of the panel Britannia, grasping the hand of America, encloses within the folds of her royal mantle the three figures of Belgium, Serbia and Montenegro, forming one big group.Emerging from the horrors of war which the allied nations are trampling underfoot, Belgium, a Psyche-like figure of pure girlhood, personification of the small nation with a great soul, appeals to Britannia. She has lost everything, but her honour is safe !She holds aloft her broken sword (she has fought heroically) ; she grasps her flag unsullied, without a rent (her honour is untouched) ; she wears the crown of thorns (her sufferings have been her Calvary).Serbia is clasping Montenegro in her arms.On the left-hand side, banded together by a cast shadow to give contrast to the sunlit group of Britannia and her sons on the right, are the allied nations.Each nation, as far as possible, is represented with an emblem of what she has given to the world.America, wearing the cap of Liberty, as the greatest of Republics, holds the scales of Justice.Italy, clad in white, carries the &quot;fasces,&quot; emblem of the Roman Law which she has given to the world.
France, with her Tricolour garlanded with laurels, points her sword to the &quot; Scrap of Paper &quot; and the broken Crucifix, and to the debris of Despotism and Militarism which she has been fighting to destroy.Japan carries the wild cherry-blossom, emblem of Japan&apos;s soul: the pure flower that carries no fruit.Greece steps forward with a statue of Fame in her hands : she has given us Sculptured highest art.- -Roumania&apos;s natural resources are hinted at by a Figure carrying an oil jar on her head ; Portugal is represented with a basket of grapes; and Russia, in mourning, hiding her face in sorrow, gropes her way forward on the extreme left.On the right are the Colonies.Behind Britannia, in shadow, Newfoundland, our earliest colonial possession, is represented as a boy carrying the Trident.Next comes the group of the four great Dominions: South Africa with the lion skin; Canada, crowned with wheat and girdled with maple leaves; Australia, advancing at the side of New Zealand, from whose shoulders hangs a sheepskin. They hold aloft their ensigns.India, who took such a conspicuous part in the War, is represented as a martial figure in old armour. Behind India stands Prince Feisul, representing the Epic of Arabia ; and in front a little Swaheli boy, bearing tropical fruits, reminds us of our obligations and possibilities in the dark Continent.The nations are assembled under a circular colonnade bearing the Angel&apos;s Christmas greeting, through which is seen a glimpse of the sea.
The three sopra-portas, (a) &quot; Silence,&quot; (b) &quot; Strength,&quot; (c) &quot; Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori,&quot; require no explanation.The decorations are painted in &quot; spirit-fresco&quot; with a &quot; restricted palette,&quot; namely, three pigments only yellow ochre, Venetian red, and cobalt flake-white being chiefly used as a ground, and as sparingly as possible. The artist aimed at the utmost effect obtainable within these limits, and felt that by eschewing brighter and stronger colours he would be enabled to make the panels keep their place on the wall, and not encroach on the rather narrow corridors. On the other hand, it was essential to keep the feeling of light and air.The artist had throughout in mind the effect of his composition as seen between the great marble columns, the architectural lines of which, instead of interfering with the grouping of his figures, are used to assist in emphasizing the main features of the designs. The borders of oak-leaves bearing the titles, lions&apos; heads, H.M. Royal Cypher, and the inscriptions surrounded with dolphins, seaweed, and shells, are common to all the panels and arches.
