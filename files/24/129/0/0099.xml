Pratt.Scottish Office, 21st November, 1921..----Bji \The present pracilco of Parish Councils acting under instructions from the Board/ is to deduct all sources of income in Calculating the amount of relief required.   The Board have received no representationa from accredited ex-service Organisations against this practice as affecting War Pensions, though the Board&apos;a opinion has been asked by one or two Parish Councils.   The only outside representa-tion received came from a Member of Parliament, who forwarded to the Board for observations a letter he had; received from a constituent on the subject.     The view the Board took at that time was that, having regard to the exceptional cir-cumetances in which relief was being given in Scotland to the able-bodied unemployed, all sources of Income, including war pensions, should be taken into account and it v/as pointed out by the Board that where an ex-service man, because of his disability, required medical treatment or special medicinal foods, etc., It was open to him to apply for medical relief.     A Parish Council is bound to. afford medical relief to any person in receipt of poor relief or to any of his dependents.     The Board had no reason to doubt that Parish Councils Wat 1-1 deal sympathetically with cases of this nature.While the Board&apos;s attitude has hitherto been, rs above, they admit that, on the analogy Of. the treatment of sick pay and disablement benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts, it may be difficult to refuse, to recognise the disabled.ex-service man&apos;s claim to retain at least part of his pension in order to meet the necessities of his disabled condition.
The Board are, however, distinctly opposed to clrcu-1arising Parish Councils authorising them to ignore any part of a pension and promising legislation on the subject at the first opportunity.     Before giving any general in-strvictions to Parish Councils the-- prefer to wait until the necessary legislation has been.-passed.      In order to enable relief to be given- to any able-bodied person, -the Board, had to authorise Parish Councils to act illegally under promise, of indemnifying legislation-later,,- .....Serious ad-minstratiVe difficulties have, resulted and -some Parish Councils desirous of going beyond the terms. .of the. law as now amended (e.g. in subsidising the *-.rages of persons em-ployed full-time but at a very low rate), have used the argument that as the Board were-able..to authorise the exceeding of the law on the general question, they could do likewise - on. subsidiary .questions - where-/the exceptional circumstancesof the&apos;&quot;times;.,justified It&apos;,... , The proposed circular on the; subject &apos;of&apos;disability pensions if issued . in Scotland would&apos; afford.&apos; such Parish Councils with a further precedent &apos;in&apos; favour, of their, breaching, the law.;    If, therefore, : it is considered to be desirable to- ignore, say, 7/6d of a disabilit;/ pension, the Board-are strongly- of opinion that the alteration in practice&apos; should be carried out only afte,r; the.-.,necessary legislation   has been obtai ned.While, subject. :to the above remarks, the Board are not prepared to &quot;disapprove &apos;of the&apos; principle, they desire to point out that there may be protests from a considerable number of Parish Councils.    -Parish-Councils in Scotland have been refused Grants by the Government to meet the grave burden.laid on them of relieving the-.unemployed.. This refusal has evoked loud complaints on the part of-Parish Councils, and.&apos;th&amp; placing of any. further burden-on- -them would-beireceiyed with hostility.. .::-.-It must be re *-&apos;.&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;-&apos; membered&apos;that in&apos;Bc!o.l&apos;l.and unemploymftiat relief is being&apos;-afforded in many.&apos; frilping part she s &apos;whqv&apos;&amp;- on;. account: &apos;of the-&apos; -drastic wage reductionsj the earnings&apos;&apos; d.f .workers &quot;have been-seriously depressed with the result...--;that- their^rate-p&amp;ying &apos; Capacity&apos;has been correspondingly reduced,-^ * -   :&apos; &apos; \;SCOTTISH BOARD C)i HEALTH,  &apos;EDINBURGH. ....   .19th November, 19.2.1..
