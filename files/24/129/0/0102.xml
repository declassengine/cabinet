EASTERN (Turkey)[November 5.]CONFIDENTIAL.Section 1.[E 12164/1/44]No. 1.The Marquess Curzon of Kedleston to the Count de Saint-Aulaire.Your Excellency, Foreign Office, November 5, 1921.ON the occasion of our interview on the 3rd November, I undertook to send you a memorandum containing the principal points arising out of the draft agree-ment concluded between M. Franklin-Bouillon and the Angora Government, and also the accompanying letter to M. Franklin-Bouillon from Yussouf Kernel Bey  to some of which I had called your attention, although it was not possible in the course of a single conversation to refer to all.I commenced by reminding you that in the earlier part of the present year I had asked M. Briand personally whether M. Franklin-Bouillon had any official mission, and had been definitely assured by him that he was a private person and rather a busybody, in fact who was going to Angora in connection with the press or for purposes of his own. Further, in July of the present year, when M. Briand was conducting negotiations with Bekir Sami Bey on behalf of the Angora Govern-ment, M. Briand had in an official note assured us that no general engagement had been or would be entered into by France on the general question of peace between the. Allies and Turkey without a close agreement with the Allies, and especially with the British Government. Finally, when M&apos;. Franklin-Bouillon went a second time to Angora in September, and we had again enquired as to the capacity in which he was acting, the French Government had admitted that he had some sort of official mission, but M. Briand had added that he had been forbidden to discuss with the Angora Government the larger questions of peace, and had been - only empowered to negotiate, on behalf of the French Government, with regard to French prisoners, the protection of minorities in Cilicia, and other points involved in the evacuation of Cilicia by French troops.Relying upon these categorical assurances, I had taken no further steps.in the matter, but, on the contrary, had pursued here the policy of close and unwavering co-operation with the French in every aspect of our Middle Eastern policy. Only during the last week I had been conducting negotiations with the Greek Ministers, and in spite of their pressure, I had insisted upon the duty incumbent upon me of acting only with our Allies, and had only yesterday successfully persuaded the Greeks to place themselves unreservedly in the hands of the latter. Fresh from this successful effort in the interests of the alliance, which I though boded so well for the future, it was with feelings of astonishment and almost of dismay that I had read the provisions of M. Fra.nklin-Bouillon&apos;s agreement, as to which I could not avoid asking a number of serious questions, and which I could hardly believe that the French Government would be prepared to accept in- its present form.The points of the agreement as communicated to His MajestyV Government which seemed to me to call for special explanation were the following: Article 1 provides that with the signature of the agreement &quot; the state of war will cease between the high contracting parties.&quot; Clearly, this phrase implies something more than a local armistice, because a state of armistice is still technically a state of war. Nothing is said as to whether the agreement is provisional pending a general peace between the Allies and Turkey or whether it is intended to have purely local scope. The latter could hardly be the case, as some of the articles appear to be of general application to Turkey. It is presumed, therefore, that the agreement establishes a state of peace between France and the Grand National Assembly.It would also appear that the agreement involves formal recognition by France of the Grand National Assembly of Angora as the sovereign authority in Turkey, in which case a peace concluded with Angora would be contrary, to the Franco-British Treaty of the 4th September, 1914, and to the London Pact of November 1915. -[7234 e-i]xe
/Article 3. This provision for the withdrawal of French troops from the territory handed over to Turkey ignores French obligations under article 8 of the Tripartite Agreement of the 10th August, 1920, to maintain troops in the zone of special French interests until the French, British and Italian Governments are&apos; agreed in considering that the Treaty of Peace with Turkey is being executed, and that the measures accepted by Turkey for the protection of Christian minorities have been put into force and their execution effectively guaranteed. While the evacuation of Cilicia, which, as M. Briand stated, was the object of the negotiations, necessarily involved the withdrawal of French troops, it was clearly incumbent on &quot;the French Government to take all possible guarantees, for the protection of minorities in accordance with their obligations.But while the full amnesty provided in article 5 may offer some protection for the minorities in Cilicia, the agreement appears to contain no safeguards for its effective operation by the Kemalists.Further, while article 6 provides that,&quot; the Government of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey declares that the rights of minorities solemnly recognised in the National Pact will be confirmed by them on the same basis as that established by the conversations concluded on this subject between the Powers of the Entente, their enemies and certain of their Allies,&quot; it is noted that the clause is not drafted to apply to Cilicia and is therefore presumably of general application to Turkey.It is thus open to the objection that it runs counter to the provisions of the Treaty of Sevres for the protection of minorities, and ignores the responsibilities assumed by the French Government for the protection of minorities in the zone of their special interests under the Tripartite Agreement. Article 1 of that agreement states that the &quot;assistance&quot; to be afforded to the Turkish Government by France &quot; shall be specially directed towards enhancing the protection afforded to racial, religious or linguistic minorities.&quot; It appears, therefore, that by this article France has not only renounced her responsibilities with regard to the protection of minorities under the Tripartite Agreement, but has pledged herself to substitute for the minority provisions in the Treaty of Sevres other provisions on the lines of the treaties made between the principal Allies and such European countries as Poland. It need hardly be pointed out that these treaties are inadequate and their provisions generally quite inapplicable to Turkey. In fact, the contention of the Angora Government on one important point of- general application to Turkey has been accepted by one Ally in advance of general negotiations for a treaty of peace between all the Allies and Turkey.Article 7. It is assumed that this article, which provides for special rights of Turks in the Alexandretta area and for the use of Turkish as the official language, will necessitate some modification of, or addition to, the draft mandate for Syria now before the League of Nations.Article 8. The revision, provided for in this article, of the northern frontier of Syria as laid down in the Treaty of Sevres cannot be regarded as the concern of France alone. It hands back to Turkey a large and fertile extent of territory which had been conquered from her by British forces and which constituted a common gage of Allied victory, although by an arrangement between the Allies the mandate had been awarded to France. The mandate is how under consideration by the League of Nations and this important and far-reaching modification of the territory to which it applies altogether ignores the League of Nations, while the return to Turkey of territory handed over to the Allies in common without previous notification to Great Britain and Italy is inconsistent with both the spirit and the letter of the treaty which all three have signed.&apos; Further, the revision provides for handing back to Turkey the localities of Nisibiii and Jeziret-ibn-Omar, both of which are of great strategic importance in relation to Mosul and Mesopotamia; the same consideration applies to the handing back to Turkey of the track of the Bagdad Railway between Tchoban-Bey and Nisibin.   In neither case have His Majesty&apos;s Government been consulted.&apos; It is noted that the frontier is to be &quot;fixed&quot; by the two parties within one month of the signature of the agreement in advance of all the other frontiers of Turkey under the Treaty of Sevres.Article 11. Inasmuch as this concession may be followed by demands from Turkey for similar privileges in regard to other sites, the Allies were entitled to expect that they should have been consulted before any such arrangement was made.Article 10. The transfer of the Bozanti-Nisibin section of the Bagdad line to a French group seems to be tantamount to the execution by France of paragraph 2
-of article 4 of the Tripartite Agreement of the 10th August, 1920, in advance of, and independently of the duties and responsibilities undertaken by France towards her Allies under the Tripartite Agreement and under the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, which are interdependent. It is presumed that the transfer of this part of the Bagdad line by Turkey to the French group is not intended to&apos;override article 294 of the Treaty of Sevres, whereby Turkey was herself to liquidate the whole Bagdad Railway on the demand of the principal Allies. Nor is it supposed that the article can be intended to give France a large portion of the railway without regard to the claims of her other Allies upon a concern which both under the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Sevres is the Allies&apos; common asset, and in respect of which special arrangements are contemplated under article 4 of the Tripartite Agreement. Paragraph 3 of article 10 provides that each party shall have the right to use for military transport that part of the Bagdad line which lies in the other&apos;s territory. This in effect appears to mean that France must permit Turkish troops to be; carried from Konia to Nisibin and possibly thus threaten the Mesopotarnian frontier. Great Britain can hardly believe that the French Government would propose to conclude an arrangement which may well have such serious strategic consequences to her position in Mesopotamia without any prior reference to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Moreover, it is not understood how the acceptance of this servitude on territory placed under a mandate of the League of Nations can be accepted without prior consultation with the other members of the League concerned.The appended letter from Yussouf Kemal expresses the hope that the French Government will endeavour to solve all questions relative to Turkish independence and sovereignty; it goes on to add that the Government of the Grand Assembly (it also speaks of the &quot; Turkish Government &quot;) is ready to grant a number of conces-sions and other advantages in favour of France and French nationals, apparently both within and without the French zone. The form of the letter inevitably lends itself to the interpretation that there is some connection of a conditional nature between the Turkish hope and promise, and the expression &quot;questions relative to Turkish independence and sovereignty&apos;&apos; would appear to be quite outside the scope of an arrangement regarding Cilicia and Syria,His Majesty&apos;s Government will be glad to learn whether the letter in question, which has been officially communicated to them, is regarded by the French Govern-ment as an integral part of the agreement. The implication is suggested that it was written in connection with some written or verbal understanding with M. Franklin-Bouillon. His Majesty&apos;s Government would be pleased to receive&apos; information on these points and to know whether the French Government have replied, or propose to reply, to the letter of Yussouf Kemal Bey.The agreement and the letter have also formed the subject of various statements in the press regarding secret clauses or annexes. It has been alleged that, under arrangements concluded but not published, France is to have a monopoly of the gendarmerie organisation in Turkey (which would be entirely contrary to the arrangements for international control contemplated by the Treaty and already to some extent carried out in anticipation) ; that a large portion of the war loan is to be handed over to Turkey; that a French loan has been arranged; that France has promised to.supply the Nationalists with- a formidable armament; that she has undertaken to support Turkish claims to Smyrna and Thrace; even that she has obtained a promise of anti-British agitation by the Nationalists in Mesopotamia. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot believe that there is any foundation for any of these statements, but, in view of their wide dissemination in the press, His Majesty&apos;s Government would like to be in a position to issue a formal denial of these and similar assertions and to announce that the published agreement was accompanied by no other written or verbal understandings.In conclusion, with regard to the agreement as a whole, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment find the utmost difficulty in recognising in its present no doubt provisional form any resemblance to the tractation locale described by M. Briand. On the contrary, it has the appearance of being a separate agreement concluded by one of the Allies with an enemy Government without consultation with the remainder, and this impression, unless it is dissipated, cannot fail to react unfavourably upon the policy of full and complete Allied co-operation in which His Majesty&apos;s Government have always believed and which they have consistently practised in their desire to bring .about a general peace in the Near East.His Majesty&apos;s Government look forward to receiving a full and friendly explana-tion on the whole of these points from the French Government, and they express the
confident expectation that the agreement in the form in which it is finally approved by the French Government will be freed from many of the ambiguous or questionable features which, in their desire to avoid all possible cause of dissension or misunder-standing, they have been compelled to point out.I have, &amp;c.CURZON OF KEDLESTON.o
