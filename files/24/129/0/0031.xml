A;  7/210s*DOODM3NT 13 the property of his britannic majesty government.I placed before the meeting of the local authorities of London which I held on the 17th Instant the proposals for assisting the poorer boroughs contained in the opening clauses of the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Bill, which were approved by the Home Affairs Committee on that date (subject to the figure for the increased equalisation rate being l/-)* Atjfi  9s(i)-It proved entirely impossible to arrive at any agreement at the meeting oft these proposals, the representatives of the poorer boroughs maintaining that an increase in the equalisation rate to    ( 1/- produced so little financial benefit to them that it would be of little practical use to them in meeting the burden thrown on the rates as a result of unemployment, and the richer boroughs maintaining strong objection to an Increase in the rate of more than 9d.     After a long discussion a proposal was made by the Town Clerk of Westminster that, as the real difficulty in the poorer boroughs arises from the cost of outdoor relief necessitated through unemployment (which charge is at present borne by the separate boroughs and not equalised over London) the proper way of meeting the emergency Is temporarily to equalise the charge for outdoor relief all over London and, with that object, to include it with other equalised charges now borne on the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund.     This proposal met with considerable favour on all sides, and the meeting eventually appointed a Committee to go further into the matter.     This Committee met on the morning of the 18th inatant, with the result shown in the note of proceedings of which a copy Is appended to this memorandum.     In view of the difficulty of the situation and of the probable short session of Parliament, it was desirable in the extreme to arrive at a settlement which would be as far as possible a settlement bycret. p.3430.L o Go 53.Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Bill.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.consenit/
consent, and I therefore felt bound to accept these proposals and to amend the Bill accordingly.     A copy of the amended Bill is appended.     The representatives of the richer boroughs present on tie 18th instant declared that they would do everything possible to&apos;obtain the concurrence of their Councils in the proposals as to outdoor relisf.It will be seen that the Bill, in so far as it deals with the question of assistance to the poorer London Boroughs, provides for socialising outdoor relief only and leaves out the equalisation rate properly so call 3d,     Ths obvious criticism on the proposals is that the effect of equalising outdoor relief over London may be to encourage extravagance in the poorer areas.     It will be seen that in Clause 1 (2) of the Bill 1 provide that no repayment from the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund is to be made In respect of outdoor relief granted in excess of such scale or in contravention of such conditions as may be prescribed by regulations framed by raes     In these regulations I shall take every possible step to obviate extravagant administration of outdoor relisf by individual Boards of Guardians.ALFRHD MOND. 21st October, 1921.Ministry of Health.
OBLendon Equal!organisation Proposals..9kji of iw^oadiiifts at Conference at Ministry of Health on ?Bth October,The representatives of contributing and receiving boroughs who were nominated as a Committee at the Conference held by the Minister of Health on the 17th October with the L.C.C.* the City Corporation and the London Boroughs met at the Ministry of Health on the 18th of October with Sir Arthur Robinson, K.C.B. as Chairman,     After discussion agreement was arrived at on the following measures as a means of. relief to the poorer areas in the present difficulties arising out of unemployment:-(1) that as from the 1st of October,1921,the expenditure on outdoor relief throughout the London County area should be equalised through the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund.(2) that as from the 1st of Ootober 1921 the charge of 5d. per head per day In respect of the maintenance of indoor paupers should be Increased to 1/3 per head per day.(3) that the Guardians should be authorised by the Minister of Health as may be necessary to borrow on overdraft or to raise loans to an amount and at a rate of interest to be sanctioned by him, the interest payable being allowed as a charge upon the Common Poor Fund.(4) that the Minister of Health should make regulations prescribing scales of relief and other conditions governing the charge on the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund under the above arrangement.Squallsation of Rates. The above proposals were agreed to by the representatives of the contributing boroughs on the basis that no change is made in the present rate of 6d. under the Equalisation Act of 1894, pending the findings of the Royal Commission on the government of London.    A majority of the representatives of the receiving
boroughs maintained a olaim to an increase In the equalisation rate, irrespective of the settlement arrived at as to poor law expenditure, while expressing their readiness to negotiate with the contributing boroughs as to the precise amount of the Increase. The Chairman noted the views expressed on this subject and under-took to report them to the Minister*Ministry of Health, Whitehall, S0w&quot;.l.13th October, 1921*
Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Bill.MEMORANDUM.Clan.se 1 (1) of the Bill increases from 5d. to Is. 3d. the sum chargeable against the Metropolitan Common Poor Puncl in respect of the dally maintenance of indoor paupers by hoards of guardians. The sum of 5d. was fixed for this purpose in 1870 and has remained unaltered since that time.Clause 1 (2) provides that the cost of outdoor relief in London shall (subject to a scale and to conditions to be prescribed by the Minister of Health), be a charge against the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, thereby making the cost a common metropolitan charge instead of a charge upon the individual unions.It is provided that this clause shall have effect for one year only, unless Parliament otherwise determines. -Clause 2 provides machinery for levying a rate in cases where a metropolitan borough council have refused or neglected to levy a rate for the purpose of meeting any precept issued to them by another authority.Clause 3 enables borough councils and local autho-rities whose accounts are subject to audit by district v auditors to borrow money. temporarily, subject to the sanction of the Minister, for the purpose of current expenses, provided that the money so borrowed is repaid out of re venae within the same financial year; but power is given to the Minister to extend this period in the case of money so borrowed Avithin twelve months from the passing of the Bill, if he is satisfied that the circumstances justify such a course.In certain cases the interest on the money so borrowed is made a charge on the Metropolitan Common Poor Pund.Clause 4 provides that money borrowed by local authorities within twelve months from the passing of the Bill for the purpose of the relief of unemployment, and money borrowed under Clause 3 shall not be reckoned as part of the debt of the local authority for the purposes of any enactment limiting their borrowing powers.
