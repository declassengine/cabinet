REPORT^Bl^TH^GBaEPAX^yFiCTS COMMANDING-IN-CHIEFOK&quot; THE TlTCATION IB IRELAND FOR ^M^ggPIgg l/Il/gl*(Circulated by the Secretary; of State for War).1.    GENERAL MILITARY SITUATION.Reports received from Divisions indicate&apos; that there has recently been a change in tho attitude of tho civilian population and that optimism wit.  regard to&apos; a settlement has given plaoo to depression and fear that tho negotiations will break-down and&apos; that hostilities will be renewed.     Such an eventuality is viewed with dismay by moderate people and by suoh members of the I.R.A. as have been prossod into its service&apos;against their will, during the last four or five months.  -  During the poriod octr..23 - 25th. a breakdown of the negotiations was apparently, in tho 6th Division Area, thought by the I.R.A. to bo imminent, and there were some indications of the; action which the rebels would take in such an event.   In the majority of cases the members of tho I.R.A. took to the hills, but in two instances in County Cork there is reason to believe that mines were prepared with a view to at tacking Or own. Forces, &apos; In another casa^ also in County Cork , members of a Brigade of the I..R.A. wore concentrated on two successive nights for attack on Crown Forces.    It may be assumed from these instances that the rebels do not intend to abide by the terms, of the agreement rogording the 72 hours, notice of termination of tho &quot;truce.&quot;Throo very serious breaches of the terrris of the agreement have occurred during the past week.    In one case et Kosh, Co. Fermanagh on Wovr. 4th.,- rebels gained admittance to a police barracks, when the majority of the garrison were absent, and, tying up a few constables, stole all the arms and ammunition. In the second case a Company store&apos; of a battalion In a. Hutment Camp at Tipperary wus broken into on the evening of November 4th., and 33 rifles, .26 bayonets, 2 Lewis Guns snd a box of bombs wore stolen.   This case is being-further enquired into.   At the-moment the Sinn Fain Liaison officials deny that it was the work of the I.P..A.., but if that is the case, it is difficult to understand who olso could have done it.    Tho Storeman was absent without leave and is under arrest. The third serious breach occurred on the Dublin-Kingstown road on the evening Novr.5th.   A number of Sinn Fein &quot;police&quot; armed with revolvers took up a position near Blackrook and held up all traffic on tho pretext that they were looking for a thief.     Amongst other vehicles they attempted to stop a oar carrying on officer and his chaffour.     &apos;:.&apos;hen the officer ro-fusef to stop, two rebels jumped onto the sideboards and covered them with revolvers.   On the officer and his chaffeur also producing revolvers, the two rebels jumped off and opened fire, to which the officer and chaff sur replied, other men of the Sinn Foin plcquat then opened fire on the oar, but the occupants wor*3 uninjured.    It is known that one rebel was hit tut the Press as usual have garbled the incident.
I regard these three incidents as most serious. The troops since July 11th. havo had to put up with numerous insults, and have had to view the stultification of their previous efforts,&apos;and the open parading of the rebels. Through all this the troops have behaved with most admirable patience and restraint, and there has been no action on their part which could cause embarrassment to the G-ovorn-mentts polioy.     I wish, however, to make it clear that incidents such as those I have described must, if persisted in, inevitably load to a collision betweon Crown &quot;Forces and the rebels.The Sinn Fein liaison officials dony that the Oftourrehces at Kesh and Tipperary k,re the work of the I.R.A. It is possibly true that no positive orders were given to carry out these outrages, but the rebel loaders must none the loss be held responsible for the results of the armed chaos they have created throughout.Ireland.Sinn Pein Cocjcts are reported in large numbers in all areas.   The occupation of buildings by the rebels in plaoe   of training camps continues,   .Appendix I. gives some instances of breaches of the truae which are of a distinctly provocative nature, and show the extent to whioh the rebels attempt to dominate the country.(SICKED)    C..
