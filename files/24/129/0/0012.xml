[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty ^Government. ]Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1921,SECRET.CABINET. TURKEY.I circulate to my colleagues the following telegram which I have received from the Viceroy with reference to the Turkish position.E. S. M.14th October 1921.Telegram from Viceroy, dated l\th October 1921.Private and personal. I wish it were possible to impress upon His Majesty&apos;s Government the importance of taking some action without delay in the direction of re-establishing the British position in the Moslem world. It is regretable to observe the effect, which increases in intensity as time passes, of no action being taken not only amongst extremist Mohamedans, but amongst the moderates who are our friends and amongst the Hindus, who are in a sense disinterested, but have made common cause on what they regard as our wrong treatment of Moslems. It is no doubt difficult in England to picture this Moslem agitation as the dominant factor in Indian politics to-day, but it is so, and more particularly because reports have been sedulously disseminated for months past that France and Italy are in favour of the restoration of Thrace and Smyrna and generally the Turkish position, but that Great Britain raises the objection for her own purposes, being determined to make Christian, influence predominant in these parts and to weaken or destroy Moslem influence.As this is momentary, anil particularly having reference to reports regarding France&apos;s efforts in Turkey, is it not feasible for the Prime Minister or Lord Curzon or a leading member of the Cabinet to make some statement in favour of the restoration of Thrace and Smyrna to Turkey ? I am hot unmindful of the still prevailing difficulties caused by the war, but our interests must be to consolidate our position in the Moslem world, and here is a golden opportunity particularly in view of the Prince of Wales&apos; visit to India. I do most earnestly urge that His Majesty&apos;s Government should now without delay make some announcement of policy with regard to the restoration of. Thrace and Smyrna and generally to the Turkish position. Nothing is so important in India at this moment, nothing would so counteract the machinations of our enemies, nothing would so quickly help in the restoration of the position of the British Government in India. If we fail at this moment to make such an announcement or to take some step in this direction and allow it later to be announced, as it assuredly will, that France or it may be Italy was the means of bringing about the better conditions for Turkey, if these are subsequently-effected, we shall not only have lost the opportunity presented to us, but we shall have caused a permanent hostility amongst -Moslems to us in India, and the Moslem has a power here at present which is greater than the comparative size of his population would warrant.I beg of you to bring this matter to the notice of the Prime Minister, Lord Curzon and members of the Cabinet, and with all earnestness that I can command, I would impress upon them the vast importance to India, and consequently to the Empire, of the restoration of our influence with Moslems in India.4745     100   10.21
