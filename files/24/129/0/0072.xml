frC&apos;/ A 498(THIS DOCEMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVSFWMSNTl^ S EGRET.Q.P. No. 5471,POLICY OF GALLING- UP THE ROYAL FLEET RESERVE IN TIMES OF CIVIL UNREST.ADMIRALTY MEf T6RANPp?I FOR THE CABINET.1. The Royal Fleet Reserve (created under the naval reserve Act, 1900)  consists of01a3S A.     Men who have completed.tine for pension (22 years) in the Active Service.plass.,,B.     Men who have left the Active Service &quot;before complstring time for pension.2. At the present time the number of men in Glass B. &apos;isabout 24,000, of whom approximately 10,000 are &quot;special service&quot; Seamen and Stokers, i.e., men who enter for five years active service and seven years in the R.F.R.     The special service Seamen enter direct without passing through the regular training establishments.3. The remainder, constituting a considerable majorityof Glass B, as well as its mos t. val-uable and highly-trained element, are &quot;Long Service&quot; Men, i.e,, Seamen, Stoker ratings and Marines, who have passed through, the ordinary curriculum of training and who have served for 12 years from the age of 18 in the active service.     These men are recruited for &quot;the, R.F.R. on a purely voluntary basis,.4S For this reason, in the opinion of the Admiralty, thepolicy of calling out the R.F.R. in the event of civil unrest merits very serious consideration, in view of the absolute dependence of the Navy on the R3F.R. in the event of mobilisation for war.     There is a very real danger that volunteers from the 12-years Men will cease to be forthcoming if the R.F.R. is habitually called upon in times of civil unrest.5. The recent mobilisation of the R.F.R.Glass B, haswithout doubt very much disturbed the men because, although they have always been liable to be called out by Royal Proclamation, they never contemplated the possibility of this happening in any emergency other than actual war.    It has now been demonstrated practically, to them that they can be mobilised on other occasions of national emergency.   This liability has caused great anxiety as to the future, and it will, without doubt, seriously affect the R.F.R.   The emoluments with which the? were generally satisfied when they only considered the war liability do not serve to ensure general contentment since their eyes have been opened to the possibility of being called up in times of civil unrest.6.    It is /
q, It is felt that in the present state of industrial unrest the liability to be called up in civil emergencies is Likely to cause employers to hesitate to place R.PcR, men in important positions, or possibly even to employ them at all.7* The fear also exists widely that in the event of theR.P.R. being again called up on account of strikes R.F.R. men stand to lose their employment, either through the action of unpatriotic employers in filling their places, or through expulsion from their Union.     In order to obtain civil employment after leaving the Active Service the majority of R.P.R. men have of necessity to Join Trade Unions, unless they start small businesses of their own.8. Many R.F.Ro men have laboriously built up small one-manbusinesses, in which they have, sunk the whole of their savings. Some of these were hard hit during the recent mobilisation, having no one to whom they could entrust the management of the. businesses during their absence.   The Admiralty endeavoured to mitigate the hardships in such cases by authorising Commanding Officers to grant leave to men to enable them to make arrange-ments, if possible, for the conduct of their businesses during their absence;   but in many instances their trade connections&quot; were seriously upset and the men were severely handicapped, on demobilisation in re-establishing them.9. At the present time some 30/ or more of the R.F.RcClass B. are out of employment, and it can scarcely be wondered at if the men feel that in one way or another they&apos;have been prejudiced seriously by the recent mobilisation.10. Prom the noint of view of the Navy it would undoubtedly be better that, so far as practicable, the Naval Reserves should not be called up in future cases of civil unrest, except to the extent to which they may be required for purely Naval duties, and that, if the R.F.R. are required to assist the Military to maintain order, the possibility of calling&apos;up volunteers instead of the whole force should be explored.11. The Admiralty desire to place this view upon record,and Mso to point out that in the event of a serious falling off in the numb or of 12-years Men volunteering to join the RoP^R,, Class B, it may be necessary to consider an increase of the R.P.R. retaining fee to an extent that would be regarded by the Men as compensating them for what is, to all intents and purposes, a new liability.    vVith present numbers, the cost of increasing the fee from 6d. to Is. a da7/ would be about  219,000 a year.(intd.)
