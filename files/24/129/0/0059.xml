LORD OITRZOj&quot; stated that ho had circulated to the Committeeletters by Er.Solby, First Soorotary to the BritishResidency, Eferpt, : ir. Scott, Acting British High OocmloadLoJler-for Egypt, and Sir Gilbert Clayton, Advisor to theEgyptianministry of tho Interior.     Two important questions wore rained, one political and the other military.   &apos;.?h9 let tors referred to political rather than military questions.     The military questions under theTerms of Reference of the 0 omit tee wore:-&apos;&quot; To consider the Military foroes and measures required to doal with the situation likely to arise in the event of a breakdown-of the negotiations with the Egyptian Delegation, and. all relevant matters such as control of water supply Ac,&quot;As, regards the military questions, the first was on theassumption that Adly Pasha accepts the proposals of theBritish Government and the troops are moved from Cairo andother stations to the Canal zone, would it be possible forus to move troops to Cairo and. Alexandria in time toensure the safety of foreigners, in the event of theEgyptian uovornnont failing to maintain order?     Thesocond question was, assuming that the negotiations withAdly Pasha broke down, wha-t would be the situation inEgypt, and what military force would bo required tomaintain order in tho country?He stated that ho had suggested to tho Cabinettheir present stations that wo should retain our existing   garrison in /        for,say, *ne yoar and after that if the country was tranquilthat we might connidor tho possibility of withdrawing the cairo garrison to Abbassia, four miles from Cairo, theAlexandria garrison to Eustapha Barracks, about sis milesfrom Alexandria, and disposing.tho remainder of .tho forcesZagassigin tho triangle formed by Port Said, &apos;* and Suez,Ho was not hopeful of tho successful conoluaion of the negotiations with Adly Pasha, and he was now manoeuvring with tho aim of putting us in a-, favourable position as poss-&apos; Ible in relation to the Egyptian people and public opinion
at home in the event. of the refusal of the British &amp;overrimentrs proposals &quot;by the Egyptian Delegation,   with that object in view it was desirable that the British Government1a offer shoulv. be as&apos; generous as possible subject to the necessity ox mailing sure of its,refusal,   On the other hand we should not offer anything that we might find it undesirable ultimately to grant.LOSH AijLSMBY Said that the possibility of removing the troops from Cairo and Alexandria depended upon the state of EgypW  So withdraw the troops now would be regarded &quot;byEgyptians as a surrender to Zaghlul, and the consequence would &quot;be that Zaghlul would gain prestige in Egypt.     he therefore considered it essential to r6tain the troops in the Giiadel and in Kasr*-el-Hil Barracks at present; hut if after a year or so the situation improved, it might he possible to move the Cairo and Alexandria garrisons to Abbassia and Mustapha Barracks respectively, as suggested by Lord Curzon. He had no doubt that if the British troops were -\withdrawn from Alexandria now, Italian and&apos; American troops would move in. to take their place; Or that, at any rate, foreign ships of war would be sent..   If it. is decided to give Egypt a measure of autonomy, it should be a gradual process.     It was essential that the Egyptian should realise that the British Government intended to adhere to whatever policy they might decide to adopt.MR. CHUECHIIdi stated that he was strongly opposed to the withdrawal o  the troops from Q&amp;iro and -JLerandria.   He was of opinion that troops quartered at Abbassia *nd Mustapha Barracks would he no less an infrirgement of the autonomy of Egypt than troops nuartered in Cairo and ^JLesardria,.  He enquired if Lord allenby was satisfied that troops in Abbassia and Mustapha Barracks would aeouro the protection of Europeans in Giro and Alexandria.   He considered that an ^ffer at the present time to withdraw our garrisons from cairo
Oairs and Alexandria would be  an aot of ovwuatiotr*art&amp;. .an abrogation of our authority in Egypt -whioh would havo disastrous results.LORD OURZOE   said that from his conversation with the Egyptian Dologatos he inferred that they would appreciate : tho distinction between a force quartered at Abbassia and a force in the Citadel overlooking Cairo; but at the present time no such withdrawal was contemplated.&apos; Tho troops would only be withdrawn from Cairo&quot;-if the Egyptians contentedly acquiesced. In stir control of the country and tranquility was re-established.   The question&apos; was what troops would be roquirod to maintain order when tho negotiations with the Egyptian Delegation broke down as he was confident they would.     He pointed e^t that it was predicted in the letters which ho had. circulated that the consequences of a breakdown of the negotiations would be that we should have to retain a considerable military force in Egypt for an indefinite time, : Strikes, outrages, &apos; be.ycst.ts and sporadic risings would *vecur.        The question was what garrison would, bo required to deal with such a situation, and what would bo tho cost.LORD allenby stated that he had informed the Cabinet that ho believed he could keep order undor those conditions with the force now in Egypt.     He submitted a statement showing tho tramps In Egypt in September, 1920, and. at thepresent time, and their distribution., (Printed as Appendix I to these Einutes),     He explained that afts-fEtho Cairo Conference Orders were given for&apos; the Egyptian garrison to be reduced by 50thof Juno to :-,1 Regiment British Cavalry.9 Battalions British Infantry (l in Khartoum) 1 Battery R.H.A. 1 Brigade R.E.A, 1 Pack Battery.There wore then only 7&apos; British battalions In Egypt, but 2 wero under orders for Egypt from Mesopotamia.   2/&apos; Battalions.--.
4.437Battalions wore brought hone fron Egypt, however, sothat tho arrival of 2 from Mesopotamia still left only 7in Egypt.   To oountorbalance this, approval was given on the 3rd of May    to the retention, of 2 Indian Battalionsdue-for return to India,    In the sane telegram thero tent ion cf 2 further Indian. Battalions and 2 Indian .Cavalry Regiments was approved, in consequence of hiatelegram of 1st &quot;ay regarding tho dangerous internal situation.Tito British battalions are now under orders to proceed to Sgypt. to complete the British Infantry there to 9 Battalions.   This trill, under present arrangementst be effected by tho end of next February, and, when effected, two of the Indian Battalions specially rota,inod should be returned to India.-    If necessary, these could be further retained, in which case the resulting garrison ^ would bo:-1 Regiment British Cavalry 2 Regiments Indian Cavalry9 Battalions British Infantry (l at Khartoum) 4 Battalions Indian Infantry. Artillery as above.Lord Alleriby suggested that the troops- now in Egyptmight, if trouble arose, be distributed as follows:-4 Battalions at Cairo.2 Battalions at Alexandria.1 Battalion at Tanta.1 Battalion at Behha,2 Battalions in the Canal Zone.1 Cavalry Regiment at Cairo *1 Cavalry Regiment in the Canal&apos;zone.On the.......
On the outbreak of trouble he proposed thpt one black battalion should be moved from the   Soadan to Assouan to protect the Dam and the Europeans in that locality. Defence Schemes were in existence for the Delta and, so far as possible for Upper Egypt which provided for tho protection of Europeans;   but it would not be possible to protect Europeans in isolated districts; especially in Upper Egypt. Mobile columns would at once be organised to operate in the Delta; and all motor cars and bicycles t-ould be requisitioned. Upper Egypt, in the first instance, might have to be left to Itself.   If the whole population of Egy:t were hostile, and if the Egyptian Army sided with them, a contingency which he did not consider probable, he considered that two Divisions (24 battalions) might be required to restore order.   &apos;&quot;&apos;*&apos; On the other hand he laid before the Committee a telegram, dated 22/lO/Sl, from General Congreve to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (printed as Appendix II to these minutes), in which General Congreve stRted thrt in the event of a rising similar to that of 1919, he would require 2 Brigades in edditioi to the present garrison in order to hold Egypt as well as the assistance of the Royal Navy.LORD alien by, continuing, said that if the negotiations broke down, the followers of Zaghlul ^vould become excited., and Zaghlul ^ould probably make some movement which would justify his arrest and banishment;.   If the British Government showed firmness, Zaghlul&apos;s arrest v^ould have a very good effect.     \&apos;ith assured support from His Majesty1 s. Government a moderate Government oould be formed which would maintain itself, with the support of the British Army.    That hud been the position after the rising of 1919 had been suppressed by British troops,    he oountry was tranquil until lord Milner resuscitated Zaghlul, who at that time was moribund. Zaghlul had seized on the opportunity to ma^e extreme demands and had succeeded in a large measure in re-establishing his influence in the country.
IiOHD CURZOIT&apos; inquired if, as3UiaiJi^ the negotiations broke down and Zagfctlui was banished and ordered re-established ac foreshadowed by Lord Allehoy, we could count uponmaintaining order and- crushing out permanently the desire for independence?   Could&apos; We count upon the Egyptians contentedly acquiescing in the  $-establishment of our Protectorate?LORD. ALLEIBY 03cpr.ess.etl the. opinion that some form Of      -independence should- be, granted,, and. that - word -&quot;Prbt.ec-torate&quot; must be... abandoned.. - Iven if the Goverrinent did not .come to terms with Adly Pasha the principle, of independence for-Egypt should be acknowledged.., British troops must be kept in the country.,   A period of firm rule was,now. necessary otherwise Zaghlul would obtain-. Control of., the. country..   At pre sent --Za$fcvlul has. a strong following: in Egypt. . If, however,, we support-the. Sultan and the Egyptian Government, Zaghlul will 16se his influence;. &amp;,fA we shall have,Egypt behind In. a recentconversation- witH Er. .Amos, Adiy:. pasha/had admitted that he could, not. sign any document which involved his $ receding in any way from the demands, that he had made, or make any.concession.to Great Brit.in.   He mi^ht,.however carry on the.. Government with, British., support.   Adly is weak and timid, and he would,probably. come to the High .... Commissioner for a decision on every question that arose.LORD CURZOE reminded&apos;Lord alien by that authority had been .givenfor the arrest and deportation of Zaghlul&apos; on October 3rd&apos;,, if Er. Scott thought it desirable, to take such action.   That authority had not been sithdrawn.
MR;*CHURCHILL   suggested that it might be wise to deport Zaghlul before the. nego^at4x)n^hroke down.&apos;., That prooedure .would probably-, mitigate the aoutene-s-s Of the seoond crisis which was inevitable when the breakdown      tho negotiations was announcedo   He folt sure that tho announoorient of Zaghiul*s arrest would give pleasure to Adly0 &apos;- Vfo shouldnot annumer that ovTaots swtuIi1 tako&quot;&quot; the worst possible-course *   He suggested, that- -crf^ter *ho Delegation had rejected tho proposals of the- british Goverament Adly Pasha 3hould be. asked -to consent to. carry on the Government of.-Egypt on the condition that we gave effect to tho proposals already approved by HoH0.; Governments, LORD allenby suggested that if the negotiations broke down the British Government should sot forth the terms offered to the Delegation in a letter addressed to the Sultan,   This lottor should prooeed to inform the Sultan of the measures proposed by the British Government for carrying on the government of Egypt,     The-letter should be handed to the Sultan by Lord Allenby on his return to Egypt, and should be in a form suitable for publication-.
Turning to the question; of- the -control, jc-f tfce- wa-U^r^ supply: &apos;. v.    - or more-LORD ALLENBY stated that it would take 48 hours/to divert&apos;the sweet water canal at Cairo with the object of cutting off the water supply of the Canal Zone.   Water could besinking      -obtained. In the&apos; neighbourhood&apos; of Tel-el-Kebir by/ wells. -Tho general up.&quot;hot. of the. military advice tendered to. the ..............     Committc - we,.:-, that:--,(i)    In the-event Of the breakdown of negotiations the present garrison would.. suffice to maintain- order- in Cairo, Alexandria and Port Said,, and to provide -----two mobile..,,columns for use in- the Delta..(il) In the event of an insurrection supported by Government and its officials,        ... a reinforcement cf two Brigades would be&apos;    : necessary.. ..    -;  ,. . &apos; .&apos; -  &apos;(ill) Should the Egyptian -,rmy. be ha;-;ti&apos;*&apos;; a -.&quot; reinforcement of two Divisions (2.4 battalions) would be required..-2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 24th October, 1921.luR, FISHER suggested the character of the document to be given to the Sultan was a matter of great importance It must bo realised that Egyptian nationalism    was a force which had come to stay.   If we can enlist it on-our side, as he believed might be done, it W^uld be a&quot; great help to us in our control of Egypt, and- in - our position in the world.--      -.-   -;     -LORD CURZON explained that as regards&apos; the political aspect of the question, he was preparing a paper for the Cabinet setting forth in parallel columns the proposals of the Imperial Conference, his own proposals, and the terms asked&apos; for by Adly Pasha.

APP2BDIX II.Tolegram from General Oongrove, Egypt,, to Sir Henry -Tilscn,, dated  2/10/21.&quot;In the ovdnt of a rising supported.-by Government and its officials&apos;, I can do no more than protect sly self.    Supposing that conditions of I-&quot;arch 1919 recur j .1- want 2 Brigades to hoop tho country, even given support of Royal ITavy in Alexandria and&apos;tho Canal.   I have enough forcos In Cairoj Alexandria and Port Said to. maintain order and 2 mobile columns for use in Delta after security of Cairo is ensured;   These troops should suffice to deal with towns in Delta; but certainly some, killing of Europeans probable before they could arrive.&apos;   Egyptian Army has lately been Increased to 7 Battalions In Egypt all officered entirely by natives, of whom juniorai aro all Zaghloulists.    I can deal with tho 4 in Cairo and Alexandria and can probably have the one at Tanta removed to safe place.   Upper Egypt is unoccupied by British Troops and has 2 Battalions of Egyptian Army.   It would have to be rerconquered after Delta is settled.,   To sum up,, if outbreak takes form of a real patriotic war against us I shall, want 2* Brigades plus Royal Kavyv&apos;  I cannot.got more than 1 Regiment lunderderff Indian Cavalry from Palestine ad interim.&quot;.... - &apos;   .- .*   The Committee concluded that General Congreve meant. -two additional Brigades towards whioh only one Regt. of Indian Cavalry can be obtained from Palestine.;.
