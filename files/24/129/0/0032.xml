Draft of Covering Letter.Sir,I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the text of the decision taken on October 20th by the Conference of Ambassadors acting in the name of, and under, special mandate for the British Empire, France, Italy and Japan, signatories, with the United States of America, as the allied and associated Powers, of the Treaty of Versailles.The said Powers have, in execution of the Treaty, sought a solution in conformity with the wishes of the populations as expressed by communes in the plebiscite, and taking account of the local geographical and economic situation.    They have, thus, decided, after having consulted the League of Nations, to divide the industrial region of Upper Silesia.    Owing to the geographical distribution of the populations and the mixture of racial elements, any division of this region must result in leaving on both sides of the frontier minorities of considerable size and in dividing important interests.Under these conditions, the decision adopted comprises measures intended to guarantee, in the common interest, the continuity of the economic life of Upper Silesia as well as the protection of the minorities,The GejTp&amp;S, Government must in addition clearly Polishunderstand that the allied Powers hold that their decision
decision forms a whole, the different parts of which they are fully determined to see observed.Should one or &quot;both of the interested Governments refuse, for whatever reason, to accept the decision in whole or in part, or give proof hy their attitude that they intend to put difficulties in the way of its loyal execution, the allied Governments, talcing into account the necessity in the interests of the general peace of seeing the regime proposed estab-lished as rapidly as possible, reserve to themselves the right to take such measures as they consider desirable to assure the full execution of their decision.of the gepan Delegation.
