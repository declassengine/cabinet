(THIS DO0UI13BT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITiNKIC MAJESTY1 S GOVSR15M3BT)Copy No.CAB I N g TREPORT BY THE GENERAL OFFICER COMMABDINGr-lB-CHIEF OE THEJX.1FJATIOH IN IRELAND FOR WEEK MLIttO&quot;&quot;00 T QEEQSng^TglT.(Circulated by the Secretary ,of State for jfet). 1. MI LI T. -.HY; SI TtJATI PIT,There appears to be no diminution in rehel activities through-out the country with regard to drilling, arming,, holding of Sinn Fein Courts and boyoottof English and Belfast ,;;ooc&apos;La. These, activities-, coupled with the enforced inaction of Crown Forces arc having a marked-effect Bpon that portion of the community which has hitherto heen af loyalist or non-&apos;iinn Fein tendencies,,   These people feel that the rehels are the men who are destined to be their rulers., and thVdisplays &apos;of ihe I.R.A. . lead them to believe that the rebel Army is in fact capable of &apos; justifying its leaders boast that it could heat the British Army if hostilities were renewed.  &quot;Examples of drilling with arms, are. shown in Appendix I but no attempt has been made in this, report to. catalogue the innunera-hle instances of ordinary drilling, establishment of I.R.A.  . training centres,&apos; or holding of Sinn Fein Courts., which are reported^from every area, and recorded in the-Police reports rendered to the Irish Office.The Cajapain ^rhich rebels have been training for the past three months are being gradually broken up and private houses and other buildings are being commandeered in lieu of these,. In t-&quot;o such instances the buildings thus commandeered - Rathkeale Workhouse and Clydagh House - the accommodation was required for .troops under the &quot;&quot;&quot;inter concentration soheme.   In the former cane the Sinn Fein Liaison representative stated that the guardians had given their permission;and that, therefore, it. was not proposed to withdraw the I.R.A.   In the latter case the troops who were to occupy the house, had to march back to barracks, 1$ order to avoid a collision with the I.R.A.In a third case the Workhouse at Swinforn was occupied by rebels who posted a sentry, armed with rifle1 and fixed bayonet, at the gate within a short distance of the Quarters of the Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders.   The Liaison representative in Dublin has undertaken to remove this sentry.   I quote these instances as examples of the intense provocation to which coix-an^ers and , troops are exposed, and the effect upon the civilisation-u mind -which must result from the inability, in present circumstances, of asserting legitimate authority.I. have had several interviews with 3*r. &apos; Pint on; Murphy who is aetin:; as chief liaison representative with my Headquarters, in the ahsence of Mr. Duggan.   Briefly the results of my inter-views have been as follows.A Commission has &quot;been appointed to visit and report upon conditions in Internment Camps&apos; and Military Prisons. The members of the Commission are Colonel Andrus on &quot;behalf of -the Military Authorities &apos;and Kr.Stalnes on behalf of Sinn Fein.C R 3 T. 3452.
It wag agreed that a copy of Colonel Andrus&apos;a report should be given to Mr. Murphy in exchange for a copy of Mr. Staines&apos;s report.   Mr. Murphy also agreed that the proceedings of the comini ssion - should not be used&apos;.for propaganda&apos;purposes.The question of the commandeering.hy-IiRVA. of bui&apos;l^in.?;s required for the normal //inter accommodation of troops . was discussed, and Mr. Murphy undertook that difficulties would not be put in our way, if he was warned first of the move cf troops.I was also informed that Sinn Fein Liaison representatives will be appointed in each county who vail deal with County Inspectors &quot;R.I,C, or with, Brigade Commanders according as the subject to be enquired into has reference to breaches of ordinary law, or to the troops.I also interviewed Mr. Staines in the presence of Colonel Andrus It was explained to. Mr, Staine&apos;8 that the treatment in I at fitment Camps was. based on the rules for Prisoners- of War Ca-ps, and that if the Internees behaved themselves they were no worse off than soldiers in Carcps.-  Mr. Stiaineb admitted that the ITewspaper Campaign for the release of Internees had no official Sinn Fein backing and that he only wished to make the men comfortable, and&apos;not to start propaganda.I also explained to Mr. Staines the right of troops to re-arrest Internees who had escaped, although I admitted that this right had not been enforced in cases .where the atmosphere mi-jht haVe been,disturbed by so doing.In view of a possible renewal of hostilities, I have issued - orders for the closer concentration of troops and the conse-quent abolition of small detachments.   This is being done in conjunction with the Police Authorities-who have given similar orders regarding Police,concentration.The events of the last few days have produced an inevitable tension on both sides, and,-, there is no doubt that Sinn Fein, or,, at any rate, the I.R.A., adveftine their confidence that they are in a position to cope with the Crown Forces, should the London Conference break,down.   &quot;While I &quot;am still of opinion that the majority of people.in Ireland desire peace, even at the expense, of withdrawing the demand for a Republic, I cannot shut my eyes to the greatly increased&apos;power and influence of the I.R.A. and to the enthusiasm for the other eventuality, which increased efficiency has roused in its rank and file. .I attach as - Appendix. II a copy- of the Terras of the &quot;Truce&quot; as agreed upon.at the London&apos;Conference together witv any remarks as to the interpretation of these&apos; terms so far as the-&quot;- effeot the action of troops.   This is&apos;being circulated to all battalions and, similar formations in Ireland.&apos;(8gd.) .C-..P.H.. iACRSSALY,---. - *; -----    -      - - General,&apos; --     Commanding-in-Chief;&apos; Ireland.-HtOj,, Ireland&apos;    &apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;- ..25th October, 1921.
