L DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT ANN IQ- MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT..Loans for Works to relieve Unemployment, Memorandum, bv^he Minister of Health,1,     I have received strong representations that it will be impossible for Local Authorities, except the largest, themselves to raise the capital monies which will be required to finance works undertaken by them to relieve unemployment..     This view was also expressed strongly at a deputation from Glamorgan and Monmouthshire recently received by the Minister ox Labour,to the present is not large;    there has not been much time, and some Authorities are hesitating to put forward proposals because of this financial difficulty.ments had to be made for financing a number of the large Local Authorities for housing, and the task of raising loans for general works undertaken to relieve unemployment will certainly not be less.2.     The classes of cases in which difficulty arises may be stated as follows;-(1) Lora] ,\v horities with r. rateable value of over  200,000 , The public Works Loan Commissioners do not usually lend to them.     Their case was recently put strongly before the Minister of Labour by the Clerk to the Rhondda Urban District Council (which has a rateable value of over  500,000), who Is one of the most experienced Clerks in the country.   He states that most of these Authorities could not borrow at all, or only on ruinous terms.(^) Roads and similar works.      The Public Works Loan Commissioners usually lend only for works of primary sanitary importance.     They do not lend for roads,     A good deal of the work undertaken to relieve unemployment will be3407.L * G152,The number of definite cases of difficulty submitted upThat the difficulty exists is obvious.Special arrange-in/
in connection with roads.     (The Cabinet unemployment Committee have noted that in cases where state assistance is given by the Ministry of Transport by way of contribution-butlon to the cost of roads, no further help should be given on the ground of unemployment). (3) Local Authorities without credit.   There are some Local Authorities with rates so high that under ordinary conditions, no prudent lender looking solely to his own interests would advance money to them.     Unemployment is acute in their districts.     They have works which can be executed - If the money is forthcoming,3.   I am afraid that, in these classes of cases,    either (a) the Government must in some way provide the necessary capital monies or (b) the works which could be undertaken to relieve unemployment cannot be put in hand;    and, while fully appreciating the reasons against the provision of loans by the Government, I am decidedly of opinion that the former is the less of the two evils.What I propose is that, in the classes of cases which I have mentioned, -the Public Works Loan Commissioner a be requested to lend the necessary capital monies to the Local Authorities, and that steps be taken to provide the Commissioners, with the necessary funds.     As a safeguard,    and      following the precedent set in dealing with housing loans, Sir Harry Goschen might be authorised to recommend the cases in which, in the special circumstances, loans should be made by the Commissioners. Part of the money would in some cases come from the proceeds of the sale of &quot;War Saving Certificates, half of which are now to be at the disposal of Local Authorities who wish to borrow   for local works.A MOID.14th October, 1921,Ministry of Health,
