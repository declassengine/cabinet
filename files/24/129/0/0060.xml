With reference to C.U. 41, Conclusion (3), the Committee had under consideration a Memorandum submitted to the Chairman by Lord Aohfield on behalf of the Under-ground Railway Companies (jurisdiction. 2$6) together with the Observations ft the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport thereon (c.U,300), and also a copy of a letter frttm the London County Council to the Prime Minister (C.U. 2$4),It appeared that Lord Ashfiwld proposed that London Tubeextensions involving an expenditure of some 54&quot; millions shc-udbe put in hand forthwith, subject to the following conditions(l)   The Contracts should be plaoed at prices not exceeding 75% over the pre-war estimates;(2)   Loans off Debentures should be issued at not more than 6% to provide the necessary capital.   The Government should guarantee the interest $nsuchifeans or debentures.e(3)   The interest on the new stock should rank before all other claims upon the Burplus from the common fund, (which the undertakings comprised in the London Traffic Combine have formed) after providing for the interest on existing debenture guarantee and prefer-enoe stacks of the associated companies.(4)   Per a period of ten years licences for motor cmnibus-ee plying for hire within the Metropolitan Police Area, shall be issued only to existing undertakings, and only in the proportion in which such licences are held at present, provided that the existing hold-ers provide reasonable traffic facilities and charge such fares only as are necessary for a reasonable re-turn upon the capital of the Companies forming the . combine.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport stated that he was informed that at a meeting between Lord Ashfield and the London Members of Parliament, it had been made clear that the local authorities would not oppose thescheme .
..vc .. ;v;0 providecl that the scheme should not bo held to affect prejudicially any local authority coning to:i\. liament for oowers to run an omnibus service, orany other transport undertaking.   I1&quot;-&apos; tI&apos;1    A... fieldhad not dissented.&apos; While it was true that tho averagereturn on the1 ordinary capital -     of thoUndoi ?r and Rdlway undertakings was only 2% f0, -.ni theother hand the average dividend of the ordinary stock of the i*o-idon Gone. :1 0 nibus O-yr-mj had been at thorate of from 11 to 12 f0 (including income tax) in thelast nine years, and there were also various subsidiaryundertakings such as the B- ui . ent C     any forconstructing and maintaining omnibuses and rolling stock wheich, it was believed, made a very substantialprofit..   If t o proposed monopoly were granted, it mustbe u;;on the conditions underlying&apos;the Railway Act,i.e.        froo competition would&quot; bo ^p^eo^-by- guarantees for an effective service and for a reasonable chargeonly being made to the public.   Om the other handwere the   revenue from omnibus services brought under control, it would bo very difficult to fix faros whichwould have the effect of reducing tho amount of dividendwhich the 0 - dbus Companies had in fact been earning,t henTho gave nment would/probably be faced With con-siderable criticism if they allowed a controlled service of hu3es to earn as much as an 11 f0 uividend on their ordinary stock -The xl   is try ..f Tr.an sport wore in. favour ofi the .fe..&apos; .:r &apos;1 scheme.   T.&apos;.&apos;.c u ^tension, of L-o:--&apos;d n Tr - CP io f^ilities was an urgent matter.   T&apos;-.e lokal authorities, whose- opposition must be got rid of, would apparentlybe/
manner indicated.   0 &apos; the other hand, the Ministryof Tr v, ..ort wore not satisfied that it would bepossible for the work to .be undertaken at a lesscoot than 100$ :.oove pre-war cost.The 0 :airman pointed out that the C-&apos;   ittee must first make u ^ their minds on the main principlewhether they oould redommend   the Cabinet to adoptsuch a scheme, and, if so, whether it was feasible to ask Parliament to sit for another week to dealwith it.     In Lord Ashfield&apos;s view unless the scheme were adopted at once it would be of no use.      TheCharabanc Companies were aiaently converting theirsummer coaches into omnibuses, and unless steps were taken forthwith it would be impossible to prevent ,a number ofsporadic piracy of/small outside interests on the bus routes which *GSSb. Lord Ashfiold&apos;s particular fear.The Home Seorotary said that he was strongly of opinion that the Committee should, recommend theproposals to the Cabinet on the ground of the . largejamount of employment   the work would give,, and the improvement to London traffic facilities: which would result and 7,u;.ich was badlX .   It could hardly be urged that the necessity for prolonging the Parliamentary Session by one week was a sufficient objection to the proposal,, having regard to the very serious- a-ount of unemployment prevailing.In tie course of the discussion which followed it was eisplained that. Lord Ash field was proposing only that the Government should guarantee the interest on .tho/
the loans raised for   the new works.   It was notalsoproposed that tho Government should/guarantee thecapital.. ,Considerable doubt was erepressed, as t o LordAshfield&apos;s ability to place the proposed works on contracts not e;:ceo.;ing 75$ of the pro-war cost,having regard to the   fact that the cost of livingwhileinder now stood at 110$,-/the increase in engineers1wages (after allowing for tho disappearance of the ..12$ bonus) was &apos; only 84$ above pre-war lovol.,&apos; and the.&apos;.thor of ore- &apos;men would/be.vory.disinclined to accept any further reductions.       On the other hand it was suggestedthat Lord Ashfield was abasing the proposal on his experience in placing a recent contract.-.Doubts were also expressed whether themoney for the work could be raised in the City, even with a Government guarantee of interest jEtrless -&quot;Kwaas,-6$. tq ejir pt   t-The   chancellor of tho iiacchequer, who entered at this stage\ stated that ho was strongly opposed to the scheme.   On the one hand tho proposal to create a quasi-monopoly would meet with very strong opposition in Parliament i   It could - ae argued that the traffic combine. intended &apos;to keep all the good routes for -&quot;themselves j and leave the bad routes which would not pay to outside &apos; interests.   Even if the   public were prepared, to accept the monopoly-in the first instance, -it would undoubtedly&apos;become-in course of time a matter of grave irritation.     The general line   of   &apos; criticism in tho. iijuse -of &quot;Commons in connection with trusts and trade combines must-be taken into account. On the other hand, the proposed Government guarantee gave rise to the following dilemma.     Either the scheme came within the proposals under the Trade Pacillties 3111 and, if so, -the-new Committee who were to administer v ....... -the/
the Government guarantee of 25 millions on new -capital iicrsEK works must consider it and pass jiuigcmont on it, or, if the scheme did not come within the Trade Facilities .^111, it would involve a.further charge,, upon the &amp;exchequer in addition to tho .25 millions. In tho present state, of the,. national, finances ho.was not    jreparod to find any more money unless ,it praa , clear that there was a very good reason-for, ine -roasing the amount.,-already sanctioned, , ; .The Chairman stated that in spite of tho objection urged by the Chancellor of th.e iixhequor, he.was-still in favour of the: scheme on. the ground that it would provide, a large amount of employment, and that something Diust be done to oxtend London traffic facilities..   It was cioar that the finances of.   omnibus and tube services \iere inseparable-,   There would be no more tubes constructed in London unless an omnibus &apos;. monopoly were agreed to.   The profits on omnibus- ,;services were- essential to the financing of the tube-    &apos; .     had &quot;&apos;.        .undertakings&apos;*   Tubes by themselves        not   paid inany country and, never vrould pay&apos;. -. The Chancellor of the l^rchoquer observed thatin order&apos;to. make the tubes, v/orkable- the Traffic Combinehad to obtain-control of tho omnibuses,, and it was,.     -therefore, a fair, as sumption that they-were . runningomnibuses at./higher charges.. than would . be imposoe if...vo\hpi&apos;^)Z v/cra free.   -    &apos;.&apos; ,    .. &quot;. . - .The /Chairman paintel/out that, having .regard. t othe wide oupoort .the scheme had receibed in tho . ress &apos;m&amp; the.publicity gi.von tc it, the -Government would be liable to very seyore criticism, if they refused to
support the scheme, in. view of the large amount ofemployment it would give.The Committee agreed, the Chancellor of  the exchequer dissenting, to report to the Cabineti):   That having carefully examined the scheme from the point of view of the large number- of people for whom it would. provide employment and   from,the point of view of extending London traffic facilities,: they are of opinion -chat the proposals made by x-ord Ashfiold should . be accepted that the powers for which Lord Ashfield asks,, with due , safeguards, appeared to be absolutely necessary in the circumstances,    &apos; andThat the Cabinet should authorise the ninistry of Transport to prepare a Bill for the purpose,. - c with a view &quot;to its passage through Paxiicmentbefore the close of the Session.2 Whitehall Gardens, &amp;.\r.l.; 2nd November.; 1921.  &quot; &quot;&apos;-.
