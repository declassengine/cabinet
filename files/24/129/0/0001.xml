THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MA JESTYjSGOVERNffi NT.With reference to the last paragraph of ray memorandum as to the release- of the Poplar Borough Councillors (G..P. 3379) I attach a draft of a 3ill the main object of which Is to embody certain temporary arrangements rdiich I think should be made for the relief of the poorer London Boroughs and for meeting the case of possible default in respect of rates precepted by the central authorities.The Cabinet wl3JL understand that these arrangements, and particularly the amount of the proposed increase in the equalisation rate, are forming the subject of negotiations with the interested parties and cannot be finally settled until the opinions of these parties have been ascertained and considered. Such stops as are possible to obtain a settlement have been and are being taken*     In tho meantime and in view of the early raeeting of parliament, I shall be glad to have the provisional authority of the Cabinet for the introduction of a. Bill generally on the lines of the attached draft.Clause &quot;i and Clause 2 of this draft provide for certain further relief to tho poorer London Boroughs which, when account is takan of the recent readjustments of the Common Poor Fund in the Metropolis, and of the recommendation of the Cabinet Unemployment Committee for the provision of loans out of voted monies to help necessitous boards of guardians, should I think be sufficient to mejot the situation.     I should add that there is considerable opposition on the part of the contributing London Boroughs to an increase in the equalisation rate to a higher figure than 9d.CABINET,L.G.51.SECRET C TP .34*01.LOCAL AUTHORITIES (FINANCIAL PROVISIONS)  BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OE HEALTH.Clause/
Clause 3 Is devised to prevent a recurrence of default in respect of precepted rates.    In the case of London there are fair principal central authorities In respect of whom default might conoeivably be made.    It is very desirable that the power of levying rates, precepted by all these authorities should be in the event of default vested in one person.    One method of arriving at this end would he to enable the London County Council, as the authority most concerned, to step in in default and levy rates.    tChe Council, however, strongly object to acting in this way, more especially in respect of rates precepted by authorities other than themselves.    The Councils view is that the Minister of Health himself should appoint a person to act In a case cf default by a borough.    I desire to avoid recourse to this expedient except In the last resort since there are obvloxxs objections in principle to such a direct intervention by a department of government in the machinery of local government.    Accordingly the Bill as drawn gives each authority:, in respect of whose rates default is made, power to appoint a person approved by the Minister of Health to levy the rates.    In the event of default being made In respect of more than one precepted rate, the Minister could probably secure that one person was appointed to act on behalf of all the authorities and in this way the least possible difficulty would be cauced in the machinery of local administration.    There would remain a risk that one or? more of the central authorities themselves might decline to appoint and though it would be a fair answer to them that if they will not adept the remedy given them they roust stand the lose, yet it may be ar?ued that it is the duty of the Government absolutely to preclude the possibility of a breakdown in the machinery of levying precepted rates and that there shouldbe/
be a power in reserve, for-&quot; the-FdnjLg-ter himself-to -appoint &amp; person to levy the.rates if other mean a fail.     On the whole I think that an addition will have to be made to the draft bill giving this power to the Minister BClause 4 contains a general power enabling a localai\thority to borrow temporarily, subject to the consent of theMinister ef Health and to repayment within the seme financialyear, fw the purpose ^efa-of meeting - current expenses incurred bythem in the execution or performanoe of any of their powersand dutieso     This claxise follows the form of a clause whichhas been In recent years often allowed to be inserted in localbills by the Local Legislation Committee, but is more stringent in that the consent &amp;f the Minister is required fwany such borrowing.     It is so drawn as to clear away any doubt as to our legal pc-wer to give effect to the resentrecommendation of the Cabinet Unemployment-Committee underwhich loans can be made on special terras as to repayment(proviso to Sub-Clause 5) to necessitous Boards of Guardiansout of monies; voted by Parliament, Boards of Guardians being an authority whose accounts are subjeot to audit by anydistrict auditor (Clause 4(4).     The Clause would also enablePoplar3 which has defaulted in the payment of precepted rates,to spread the burden of the arrears over a period of time, -inwithout the necessity of having to levy an inordinate x^o/respect of one quarter to meet the accrued deficiency.     I understand that If a rate is to be levied at once for the Tshole deficiency such rate would bring up the rates in Poplar for one quarter only to a man of approximately II/- in the  * -o. sum which I am satisfied is out of the question at the pr e b en t m oik on t.
I think it right to inform the Cabinet that the London County Council, while agreeing to these facilities to meet the special ease of Poplar, are very strongly opposed to the giving of them for London Boroughs generally, on the ground that they would be extremely liable to abuse and that the safeguard of the minister  approval will not be adequate. It may well be that the view of the London County Council may find strong support in Parliament.     Alternatives to the present fouri of tae Clause would be&quot;, (1) to make the County Council and not the Minister the sanctioning authority In the case of London Boroughs, and (2) to make the Clause special to the case of Poplar, and provide, If necessary, in a separate Clause for the proposed loans to Boards of GuardianswClause 5 is introduced Into the Bill to meet a recommendation of the Cabinet Unemployment Committee that in the case of loans raised for the relief of unemployment we should remove the present statutory bar to the raising of loans in excess of two years assaasabla value In the area of an authority.It will be seen that Clauses 1 and 2 of fee draft bill which provide additional relief to the poorer London Boroughs are temporary classes so as to admit of recommendation on the report of the Royal Commission on the Government of Greater London whicLi has just bean appointed.     Hie proviso to Clause 4 (3) and Clause 5 are also temporary.
