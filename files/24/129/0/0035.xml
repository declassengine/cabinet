W.-E.The War Office,21st October, 1.921.1. Occasion for this paper.The withdrawal of the Greek Army, at the end of September, 1921, to their old lines east of Eskishehr, marks the completion of a definite phase in the Turcp-Greek operations. The occasion thus&apos; arises for a fresh appreciation of the situation in Anatolia.2. Course of recent operations.The map attached to this paper indicates (a.) The Greek positions at the commencement of the operations in July; (5.) The furthest point reached in the Greek advance on Angora; (c.) The position&apos;on 1st October.3. Greek objectives in recent operations.In these operations, which began on 9th July, 1921, the Greek objectives were as follows :-1st Objective.-^ compel the Turkish Nationalist Army to fight, and to destroy it.2nd Objective. To occupy the Nationalist Capital, Angora.(a.) With the political object of bringing the Turks to terms. .(6.) With the military object of gaining possession of the Nationalist workshops and dep6ts at Angora, and of denying to the Turks the use of the Angora Eskishehr railway, the main line of approach . to Smyrna, from the heart of Anatolia.3rd Objective. To obtain the power of rapidly concentrating their army, either on the Brusa or Ushak front, by gaining possession of the Anatolian railway, through Eskishehr and Afium Kara Hissar.4. Results of the operations.The extent to which tiie Greeks obtained their objectives is as follows :  1st Objective.In the early stages, the Greeks failed to bring about a decisive battle,- although they succeeded in surprising the Turks and turning the Kutaya position. At Eskishehr, on 21st July, the Turks seized the initiative and carried out a very strong counter-attack to hold up the Greek advance. It is to be noted that this counter-attack synchronized with the refusal of the Angora Government to accept the offered assistance of the Bolshevik Army of the Caucasus. This counter-attack was defeated by the Greeks who, however, were unable to reap the fruits of victory owing to the fatigue of the troops and the necessity for reorganizing the Greek supply and transport arrangements after their long and rapid advance over difficult country. Following this battle the Turks withdrew a further 70 miles east, refusing battle west of the Sakaria river. They thus compelled the Greeks to follow them through an inhospitable country, and to extend their lines of communication to such a degree that supply became a matter of the greatest difficulty. This difficulty was intensified by&apos; the successful raiding activities of small Turkish forces which hovered on the flanks of the Greek advance. The Turks accepted battle at the Sakaria and won a signal victory; and the Greeks have therefore failed in their primary objective.(B21/830)   100  10/81   H&amp;S, Ltd  9506wo2193
2wc? Objective. , .The Greeks have failed to gain their second objective, but they report that they have done much damage to the Angora Eskishehr railway.3rd Objective.The Greeks have attained this objective at a cost greatly exceeding their estimates. It, however, remains to be seen whether they will be able to hold what they have gained. Their front from Afium Kara Hissar through Alpi Heui to Bilejik measures 140 miles, without making any allowances for covering the open flank at each end of this line. It is supplied by two lines of communication situated in the rear of the extreme flanks, and neither of them adequately protected by the position of the field army. Furthermore, the northern line of communication through Brusa, which was 20 miles in length prior to these operations, now measures 125 miles to Eskishehr; whilst the southern line, which formerly measured 185 miles to Tonlu Punar, now measures 225 miles to Afium Kara Hissar. These extended lines of communication are very vulnerable and invite attack.The Greeks have thus.gained only the least important of their three objectives; but it is probable that even this partial success is more than counter-balanced by the moral effect produced, both in the opposing armies, and also among the inhabitants of Anatolia, by the Turkish victory at the Sakaria.5. Causes of Greek failure.The causes which appear to have led to the failure of the Greek Army may be summarized as follows : (a.) The over-weening confidence of the Higher Command in the power of their army.(6..) An indifferent intelligence service, which appears to have given very incompleteinformation concerning the enemy, (c.) The plan of operations for the battle of the Sakaria was exceedingly compli-- cated, thus leading to many unforeseen situations with which the Greek organization was not sufficiently good to deal. (d.) Faulty means of inter-communication.(e.) Inadequate means of transport and faulty supply arrangements.(f.) Faulty ammunition supply. ,(g.) Bad subordinate Staff work generally.(h.) Their failure to cripple the Turkish Army in the early stages of the operations. This compelled them to employ at the Sakaria forces lar,ger than they were able to maintain there.6. Distribution of opposing armies, 23rd September, 1921.From the latest information at our disposal, the distribution of the opposing armies appears to have been as follows : Greek Army  Rifle and sabreBilejik area  strength.1 Division        ..........     &apos; ...       -,. 3,7001 Regiment         ...       ...       ...       ...       ... * 1,500Eskishehr area, General Headquarters 10 Divisions        ......       ......... 37,000Cavalry Brigade   ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 500Afium Kara Hissar area 1 Division................... 3,7002 Regiments        ....       ...       ...       ... 3,000Reserve 6 Regiments          ...       ...       ...       ... 7,500Total.............56,900Nationalist Army Bilejik area 2 Divisions       ...       ... ... 3,500Eskishehr area 12-g Divisions        ... ...       ... 30,500&quot;Afium Kara Hissar area 10 Divisions ...       ... 15,750Reserve 6 Divisions  ...       ...       ... ...       ... 14,000Total............     63,750
7. Present condition of the Turkish Nationalist Army.(a.) The Higher Command. Doubt no longer exists as to the efficiency of Nationalist General Headquarters, and of the Commanders of formations. Their conduct of the retirement, over 100 miles in length, in the face of a resolute enemy, and without any serious mishap, confirms the skill of commanders and higher staffs, while their handling of the difficult tactical situation in the battle of the Sakaria appears to have been efficient.(b.) The troops. All the information at our disposal indicates that the Turkish soldier is good. The cavalry have shown enterprise and dash. The infantry have fought stubbornly and well, and their marching has been in no way inferior to that of the Greeks. The artillery, though numerically weaker than that of the Greeks, has been skilfully handled.(a) Casualties. It is reported that the Turkish casualties from the com-mencement of operations have amounted to about 30,000, and that in addition there have been some 10,000 deserters. It is also reported that 31,000 reinforcements had been sent to the Army before the end of the operations. It may, therefore, be assumed that the Army will soon be up to its original strength.(d.) War materiel. -There is no evidence to show that the Turks are dangerously deficient in guns, rifles, ammunition, or other war materiel; but it is known that their reserves are small. As, however, from secret information at our disposal, it is believed that they are now arranging for large supplies of this nature from France and other European countries, it seems probable that by next spring they will be better armed and equipped than they have hitherto been. We have no definite information as yet that contracts are complete, although arrangements are far advanced. When these arrangements are complete, the Turks will no longer be dependent upon Bolshevik Russia alone for the supply of such materiel.. (e.) Moral. The moral of the Turkish Nationalist Army must be considered high. The effect of the victory at the Sakaria, and the subsequent 60 miles advance, will have spread, not only to the Army, but throughout the length and breadth of Anatolia. It will assuredly have kindled Nationalist enthusiasm among those who were wavering in their allegiance to Mustapha Kemal, and is likely to redouble the difficulties of the Greeks in the occupied area.(f.) Position of Mustapha Kemal. There is no doubt that the prestige of Mustapha Kemal himself has been greatly enhanced as a result of these operations. Formerly in the position of a Prime Minister answerable to a Government, he now appears to be almost in the position of a Dictator. We may, therefore, assume that the Moderate Party in the Angora Government is, for the time being, firmly in power, and this assumption, if correct, would seem to remove any immediate danger of the return of Enyer Pasha, or of a military alliance between the Nationalists and Bolshevik Russia, especially as the Nationalists will shortly be no longer wholly dependent upon Russia for the supply of war materiel. At the same time, Mustapha Kemal is in such a strong military position, that there appears to be no reason why he should moderate his political demands, in the event of peace negotiations being re-opened.8. Present condition of the Greek Army.(a.) The Higher Command. Full credit must be given to the Greek Higher Command for their excellent conduct of the eai&apos;lier phases of these operations. With the exception of one miscarriage of orders, while the Greeks were advancing through Eskishehr, by which an opportunity was lost of intercepting a considerable Turkish force, the operations were carried through according to plan. Even in the battle of the Sakaria the Greeks appeared at one time to be within reach of victory, but at the crisis of the battle they allowed themselves to be outgeneralled by the Turks, and thus they failed.&apos;(&amp;,) The troops. All evidence in 6ur possession goes to prove that the Greek troops marched and fought admirably, in spite of great privations. Their defeat at the Sakaria, and subsequent retirement to Eskishehr, must inevitably have adversely affected their moral, which, previous to those events, was very high. They must also, to some extent, have lost confidence in their leaders, and this will no doubt lead to the usual political bickering, so prevalent in the Greek Army even in better times, which reacts so unfortunately upon its efficiency.(c.) Casualties. It is reported that the Greek casualties have amounted to about 31,000. Most of these casualties have no doubt been replaced already, and the balance can be replaced in the near future.(9506)
(d.) War materiel. It was evident that at the Sakaria there was a shortage of ammunition, but this is accounted for by the failure of transportation arrangements, and did not represent an actual shortage in the country. As the Greeks are now at liberty to purchase their requirements from civilian firms of any nationality, there appears to be no reason why they should not in future obtain all their needs, up to the limit of their financial resources.9. Courses open to the Turkish Nationalists.It is evident from recent information that the Greeks do not intend to resume the offensive before next spring. The initiative in the campaign may therefore be considered as having definitely passed to the Turks. The courses open to Mustapha Kemal are as follows : (a.) To continue operations on a large scale and engage the Greek Army with a view to defeating it, and driving it out of Anatolia.Such operations would be difficult at any time, owing to the lack of railway facilities and accommodation for troops, but the difficulties in winter will be multiplied many times. This course is therefore very improbable, if similar results can be obtained by other means.(6.) To avoid a general engagement, but to harass the Greeks by guerilla operations, directed against their lines of communications, with a view to compelling them to withdraw from their present line.Such operations present comparatively little difficulty. Mustapha Kemal would be able to count on receiving assistance from the Turkish elements of the population in the occupied area. Climatic conditions, and the difficult nature of the country, would render such operations even more difficult to cope with than the similar tactics adopted by the Boers in the later stages of the South African War. If the Turks successfully develop guerilla tactics they would stand a good chance of compelling the Greeks to abandon Eskishehr.(c.) To avoid all active operations against the Greeks and devote the winter to training and re-organization, hoping that political and financial troubles will force the Greek Government to demobilize the bulk of their army during the winter.Time is undoubtedly in favour of the Turks in this connection, as the Greeks cannot afford to maintain a large army in the field for an indefinite period. From a military point of view, however, the complete cessation of offensive operations is unsound.(d.) Concurrently with (a), (b) or (c) the Angora Government may develop operations against either Constantinople or Mesopotamia, with a view to bringing pressure on the Allies to induce them to modify the terms of the Treaty of Sevres.An early advance on Constantinople, with the Greek Army situated on the flank as it is at present,&apos;would be a very dangerous military operation. It would also bring the Nationalists into direct conflict with France and Italy, as well as with Great Britain, thus creating a situation which would appear to be at present out of harmony with the political programme of the Angora Government.An operation of any magnitude against Mesopotamia appears to be equally improbable unless the French Government conclude a separate peace in Cilicia. It is considered that Mustapha. Kemal will be disinclined to reduce his forces on the western front by sending any considerable detachments to the Tigris front so long as the Greek Army remains in Asia Minor. Even if political considerations demanded such a course the difficulties of transportation would probably prevent its adoption. The central section of the Baghdad Railway is in French hands, so that the Turks would have the assistance of the railway for only a portion of the distance.An operation undertaken by a small detachment against the Mosul villaye   is however, always possible, until such time as peace is restored in Anatolia.   It is m doubt realized at Angora that even a small operation in this area would suffice to cause much disappointment and anxiety in Great Britain, and we must therefore be prepared for the possibility.   The enemy forces, to be expected, would consist of local tribesmen,
-supported by such Turkish regulars as still remain in the Diarbekr area. The numberB of Turkish regulars in this area are believed to be small, but there are enough to cause us trouble. On the other hand, if the French conclude a separate peace in Cilicia, -ample Turkish forces would become available to cause us serious anxiety.10. courses open to the greek army.The arrival of winter precludes the possibility of offensive operations on a large scale. Any minor offensive operations, which might be undertaken, would merely tend to increase the supply and transport difficulties, which are already considerable. The &apos; courses open to the Greek Army would therefore appear to&apos; be as follows : (a.) To maintain their present positions, with a view to resuming the offensive in the Spring. &apos;It seems probable that, by the Spring, they may find the Turkish Army a more formidable and efficient machine than it has been hitherto. There would therefore seem to be no better prospect of gaining a definite decision next year than in 1921.(b.) To select a suitable frontier line and make preparations for the permanent occupation of the territory they propose to annex.With an unbeaten Turkish Army still in the field, the Greeks will be compelled, if they adopt this course, to maintain an army in Anatolia of sufficient size to deal with the Nationalist Army. Financial and political considerations would appear to forbid this course.(c.) To retire to the boundary of the Smyrna and Brusa enclaves, or possibly to that of Smyrna only, with a view to reducing the size of their army.By this means they would be able to make great reductions in the size of the army, but such a retirement would be regarded as an admission of defeat, an admission to which the Greek Government would probably be unwilling to subscribe. Even if such a course were adopted, there is no guarantee that it would bring peace to Anatolia. Mustapha Kemal has repeatedly declared that he will continue the war so long as the Greeks remain in Smyrna, and there is little doubt that he intends to carry out his word.11. conclusions.In view of the factors enumerated above, it is the opinion of the General Staff that the Greek Army is not capable of enforcing a decision upon the Turkish Nationalists.In a former paper they gave as their considered opinion that although it appeared CP. possible that the Greek Army, fighting alone and unsupported, might obtain some initial success in the operations which were then about to commence, they saw no paja&apos; prospect of any decisive victory being gained which would bring peace to Anatolia.The course of recent events has confirmed this opinion. Furthermore, recent decisions of the Supreme Council with regard to neutrality have tended to make the future still darker for the Greeks. The Turks will no longer be restricted to Russian Bolshevik sources and the contraband traffic for the supply of their needs in war &apos; materiel, as they are known to be in negotiation for large supplies of war materiel from European countries. The General Staff are of opinion that, as time goes on, the relative efficiency of the Turks as compared with that of the Greeks is likely to increase.The General Staff are, therefore, of opinion that the Greeks have nothing to gain by continuing military operations, and that the best course open to them is to commence peace negotiations with Mustapha Kemal immediately, using such territory as they hold to bargain with, before its loss is risked.
