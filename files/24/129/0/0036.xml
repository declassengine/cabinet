HIS DOOUivlEN&apos;&apos;.T IS THIS PKOP h&apos;ivx OP HISBhlTWNIO hnJESTYC A B 1 N   cabinet.5.435.FOOD CONTROL ORDERS.M em or andum by the president., of tho Board of Trade.The only restrictive Orders under the Ministry of Food (Continuance ) act now remaining in force (apart from the control of hops) are (1) The Sale of Pood Order, and (2) Orders requiring returns (a) of Stocks of Pood, (b) of cattle slaughtered, and (c) of the capacity, location, and use of commercial transport vehicles.    The Road Transport returns are referred to In my memo ran dura on the future of the Supply and Transport Organisation (CP. 3433).    I now desire the direction of the Cabinet as tc - the retention of the other Orders which have been continued only on the ground that some or all. of their provisions might be embodied   in the form of permanent legislation,SaLJ^OP. ffiODffifetfh.    a promise was made to the Consumers&apos; Council by Mr. Clynes, when Pood Controller, that the statutory restrictions affecting the sale of bread and tea by net weight, tho labelling of imported produce, and the description on sale of jam and edible fats, would not be wholly revoked, until the Government had considered the advisability of their embodiment In permanent legislative form.    This promise was adhered to by his successors, and the Home Affairs. Committee sanctioned the drafting of a Sale of Pood Bill without, however, guaranteeing any facilities for its introduction. The Sale of Food Bill was necessarily drafted on lines whic would not readily find Parliamentary acceptance to-day, as it gave the Food Controller and his successors in title general powers to regulate by administrative order  .
the description, quality and weight of foodstuffs generally. In the month of August last, In view of the approaching dis-bandnient of the Ministry of Pood Enforcement staff, which had then become part of the Board of Trade, arrangements were made for the Local Authorities throughout Great Britain to enforce the Orders which the Department felt itself pledged to maintain, and these were, for convenience of reference, consolidated In the Sale of Pood Order.This Order, then, consists of five operative parts, the first two dealing with the sale of bread and tea by net weight, the third with the labelling of Imported produce, the fourth and fifth with tho description on sale of jam and edible fats. The fourth and. fifth parts are not thought to be of real importance.     Tho sale of tea by net weight and the labelling of Imported produce are excellent provisions   in themselves, but I doubt whether the present trend of Parliamentary opinion would favour their enforced continuance.     The retention of. the first part governing the sale of bread, by net weight ia rendered very complicated by the fact that at the end of last year Mr, McCurdy appointed a Ccomittee, presided, over by Lord Rathcreedan and comprising throe Members of Parliament, as well as representatives of the Board of Trade, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Pood,  to consider the provisions of the Order in relation to the Bread Acts and in the light of the experience gained by its comparatively prolonged administration. TheCommittee   were   of   opinion   that   the   operation   of   the provisions   of   the   Order   had   proved   satisfactory   and   of benefit    to    the   public,    and recommended   that the principle of   a fixed   minimum   weight   for   the   loaf   should be embodied in an Act   of   Parliament.       They recommended the repeal of
the Broad Acts of 1022 and 1836 and the passing of a new Aot giving effect to certain detailed recommendations.Assuming that no legislation la possible or advisable In respect of other matters comprised in the Sale of Food Order, I do not think the present time at all suitable for the introduction of a Sill framod in pursuance of the recommendations of Lord Rathe re edan1 s Committee,, not-withstanding that its provisions might and probably would bo beneficial4   Bakers generally, though not entirelys would resent the continuance of a war-time control, and this attitude would find   considerable support with a large section of the community *   At the present moment the Order is probably of clear benefit to the public as It prevents weight   being out at -the same time as prlcess but when the- priee of flour becomes stabilised there is, X think, good ground for assuming that competition will afford tho purchaser sufficient protections   It will no doubt be necessary some time to revise aad- antiquated provisions of the Bread Aets5 and I anticipate that Local Authorities will press for this whenever the Order is removed,   I deprecate,   however, the introduction of legislation of this sort at this particular time.   Tho Order will become inoperative on the 31st August, 1922, so that If the Cabinet share my viow there would seem, to be ns good reason, for its retention. As, however, fresh arrangements have only just been made for its enforcement, I should propose to defer its revocation until the end of the year,STATISTICAL RETURNS OF STOCKS OF FOODSTUFFS.    The Cabinet decision of 28th Deoember, 1920, favoured tho retention of these returns on the ground that acute difficulty had been felt at the outbreak of war by the absonce of accurate
information as to stocks of foodstuffs generally and particularly as to the stocks of wheat and whoa ten flour * Tho present returns embrace all the more important foodstuffs, but I am in favour of retaining only the returns as to wheat and wheaten flour and of keeping these going until trie latest possible date (August 31st, 1922) in the hope that some opportunity may occur for the introduction of a short Bill authorising their continuance,RETURNS, OF, CATTlg SLAUGHTERED.    The Cabinet decision on this point (Cabinet 78 (20) (ii)).was that the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Food Controller should settle the question of the retention of the staff on the basis that these returns should be maintained.    The arrange-ment hac been that keepers of licensed slaughter houses C2j*4m*-^ forward to the Board of Trade returns of cattle slaughtered and tho Board of Trade should tabulate these and forward them to tho Ministry of Agriculture and the Scottish Board of Agriculture,   I understand that the Scottish Board do not attach much value to the so returns, but tho Ministry of Agriculture find thorn useful,    Thoy will necessarily become less accurate now that the Licensing of Slaughter Houses Order has been revoked, and I am not myself clear that they arc worth retaining ovon though an annual return should bo substituted for the present monthly returns.   In any case if tho Cabinet desire their retention in England and Wales after the close of the calendar year, I should prefer that any returns be made direct to the Ministry of Agriculture, who could themselves do the necessary tabulating work.(Initialled) S.B.21st October, 1921.
