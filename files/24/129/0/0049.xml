SUMMARY.GENERAL.As a world influence the Third International continues to recede. It has probably lost from half to two-thirds of its last year&apos;s strength in Germany, Italy and Spain. In Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden, all strongly socialist by inclination, the movement is without heart, while the French have also grown cold.Communist endeavours remain dominated by the Russian famine, which they are doing their utmost to exploit. The obduracy of the Soviet has checked any measures of relief which Western governments might have applied, and has thrown the burden of help upon private charity. The propaganda Of the Third International is now largely directed to exploiting the question of famine relief for the purpose of inciting to revolution abroad.Evidence is accumulating that throughout Western Europe and America the Communists are seeking to use the prevalent economic distress as a means to revolution.The sub-division of Communism continues. The creation of new parties is reported in Holland&apos; and in Switzerland, arid a Fourth International has been formed in Berlin. ?PRANCE.The deadlock continues in the textile strike in the North, but there are indications that the strike will gradually collapse. The general strike in the North has been settled, and attempts to provoke a national strike have failed.The long threatened split in the Trade Union movement is about to become an established fact. The revolutionary minority is now awaiting formal expulsion.BELGIUM.Some Communist activity is being shown, but the party is loaded with debts, which it is asking Moscow to relieve. There is still acute friction between rival leaders.ITALY.Socialist activity has been centred upon preparations for the Milan Congress.Another hitch is reported in negotiations for a commercial agreement with Russia.SPAIN.The threat of a general strike has so far not materialised. The extremists appear to be divided among themselves, but there- are signs that their influence is increasing.PORTUGAL.Great unrest is prevalent, aided by the acute economic crisis. The suppression of various revolutionary movements is reported.
NORWAY.A commercial treaty&apos; between Norway and the Russian Soviet has been ratified.  &apos;The Norwegian organisation of Trade Unions has decided, from motives of policy, to remain for the present in the Amsterdam International. , &apos;SWEDEN.There is evidence of a determined effort on the part of the Communists to exploit the serious unemployment crisis. The general movers behind the unemployed agitation are said to be, not Scandinavian, but German Syndicalists.DENMARK.A great increase of Communist propaganda is reported.HOLLAND.The Dutch Communist Party has split, the secessionists having formed an independent Communist Workmen&apos;s party, which is not for the present of very great importance.GERMANY.The Fourth; or Communist Workers&apos; International was founded in Berlin during September. It claims the support of the K.A.P.D. and of groups of Left extremists in other countries. It rejects the directive of Moscow, and aims rather at local and national autonomy.Krestinsky, the Soviet Commissary for Finance, has now succeeded Victor Kopp as Soviet representative in Berlin.SWITZERLAND.Various members of the Communist Party in Basle have seceded from the party and formed an independent. Swiss Communist Party, which has, however, slight prospects of longevity.AUSTRIA.The Communists are reported to be taking steps to organise the Austrian unemployed.CZECHOSLOVAKIA.It has been decided that the fusion of the Czech and German Communist Parties shall shortly take place, but national feeling will render such a fusion fictitious.RUSSIA.The situation is dominated by the famine. The Soviet still refuses to allow a Commission of Enquiry to enter Russia, and the Western governments find themselves unable to alter their previous decisions that a Commission of Enquiry must investigate transport and means of distribution. The propaganda of the Third Inter-national, which has hitherto been political, is now enforcing the need for immediate material aid for famine victims.The Berlin Committee is so dominated by agents of the Third Interpationai as to have become an instrument of its policy.   The
famine is, in fact, Vrfng extensively exploited by the Communists. The doings of even the Russian Famine Relief Fund in this country, presided over by the Lord Mayor of London, are being closely watched and influenced by the Russian Delegation here, through the inter -intermediary of H. N. Brailsford, and possibly of others. As the work of this fund develops it will come under the supreme direction of a British Commissioner, whose name it is hoped will carry conviction. General Sir William Robertson has been approached to act in this capacity, but has refused. It is understood that Sir Ian Hamilton has since been approached and is willing to go to Russia, returning thence to take up the appointment of British Commissioner, and, further, that he is willing to co-operate with Dr. Nansen.The Soviet continues to make various false accusations against France, Poland and Roumania. Its answer to Lord Curzon&apos;s note was the inevitable tissue of denials and declarations that the evidence adduced was based upon forgeries.ESTHONIA.A considerable diminution of Bolshevik espionage and propaganda work is reported.LITHUANIA.It is now established that the Bolshevik organisation had depart-ments in all the towns and larger villages of Lithuania. Moscow is depressed at the position in the Baltic States.TURKEY.The friction between Bolsheviks and Nationalists continues. There are indications of a revival of Communist, activity in Constantinople.EGYPT.Zaghloul is now said to favour new tactics, leading towards peace, with Adly Pasha. His reception of the British Labour Delegation seems not to have been unduly enthusiastic.GEORGIA.Budu Mdivini, recently the representative of the Russian Soviet in Angora, has now been appointed president of the Tirlis Revolu-tionary Committee. An intensification of Bolshevik tyranny is reported.SIBERIA.The situation, from the Communist point of view, has been pessimistically reported upon by a special committee sent from Moscow.CANADA.It is established that Soviet money has been sent into Canada through the Pan-American Bureau to foster sedition. Communist activity is largely devoted to the exploitation of the unemployed.
SOUTH AFRICA.Commutdst activity among the natives continues, and appears to j be stirring up much discontent. iAUSTRALIA.There is reported to be little chance of Bolshevism establishing! itself in Australia. The amalgamation of all labour bodies to fightl capital is being spoken of.NEW ZEALAND.The New Zealand Workers&apos; Union has decided in favour of the formation of One Big Union, and is seeking to amalgamate with the New Zealand Alliance of Labour.
Confidential.A Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.part i.1. latin countries. france.the industrial troubles.The textile strike, which for a time developed in the North into a general strike, continues, and deadlock is for the moment absolute, though the impression is that the strike will gradually fizzle out. The earlier attempts made to bring about a settlement were unavailing, both sides stubbornly asserting their claims, the men that the cost of living justified no reduction of salaries, the employers that not the fall in the cost of living, but unavoidable economic forces, compelled them to reduce wages and that even with the reductions that had brought on the strike they paid wages higher than those demanded by the present index figure. M. Jouhaux himself has admitted that the employers are in a difficult position, but he blames them for their uncompromising attitude.The labouring class of the North responded fairly unanimously to the Confederation Geherale du TravaiTs appeals for a general strike, and showed discipline and enthusiasm. Metal, transport and brewers&apos; workers went on strike, the total number of men affected being close on a million. The Employers&apos; Union not only refused to make concessions but would not even meet the workmen&apos;s delegates. As a last resort M. Briand threatened that the workmen &quot;vvould be allowed to occupy the works, as it was not possible to allow a whole population to suffer through sheer obstinacy in not wanting to listen to the workers&apos; claims. The result was that the employers, though refusing to accept the arbitration of the Minister of Labour, consented to alter their decision to reduce salaries from 20 centimes per hour to 10 centimes per hour, with a reduction of a further 10 centimes in two months&apos; time. This show of conciliation ended the general strike in the North. In the Troyes area an appeal to the other unions to strike in support of the textile workers won no response. It would seem that the movement in the North and East provides another example of the old system of strikes by successive groups which always results in the failure of the general result anticipated.Troops have been sent to the North to keep order, and once again it has been found necessary to resort more especially to the cavalry who are generally, in France, the most loyal troops. An important force of gendarmes has also been concentrated in the North. Some incidents have resulted. The troops on the whole are keeping a good attitude, but act with great hesitation against the strikers.
Tho situation has naturally been exploited by the revolutionary section of the Confederation Generate du Travail, who have been working hard to bring about a general strike throughout France to assist the northern strikers, and to gain the nationalisation of industry. The Communist Federation has launched a manifesto stating that the hour of liberation is approaching and inviting the workers to manifest in favour of the strikers and the Russian people. The Federation has also tried to persuade the railway workers to refuse to assist in transporting troops to the North of France-.The Split in the Trade Union Movement.The National Confederal Committee of the Confederation Generale du Travail has elected all the moderate candidates and decided definitely by 63 Votes to 55 to exclude the unions adhering to the C.S.R. (Revolutionary Syndicalist Committee). Jouhaux, Dumoulin, Lapierre and Laurent were re-elected secretaries for a further two years. The majoritaires argue that if the extremists will not conform it is better to force them outside the fold than to allow them to remain within it for the sake of a fictitious &quot; unity.&quot;The long-threatened split in the French Trade Union movement is thus about to become an accomplished fact. f The revolutionary minority, comprising about three-sevenths of the unions and federations, is awaiting formal expulsion by individuals in the case of unions, and by unions in the case of federations. The Central Executive of the revolutionary trade union committees has issued a manifesto, protesting against the split decided upon by the majority and calling for discipline and a policy of non-provocation. No rival confederation will be established until after a General Congress of the expelled minority.Extremist Movements.A recent development of extremist activity has been a violent campaign in the Socialist and Communist newspapers against the occupation of Syria by French troops.Collections on the Russian &quot; Famine Day &quot; on September 4th, raised 35,000 francs in Paris and neighbourhood. The patriotic &quot; Journee du Poilu &quot; brought in close on a million francs. The collection was officially forbidden by the Prefect of Police, but the collectors showed great tenacity.The Directing Committee of the Communist Party has adopted the thesis of the Amsterdam International Bureau, which consists in creating a general revolutionary movement in Germany, Italy, Great Britain and Spain. The proletariat of the United States is considered not to show sufficient guarantees of Communist solidarity.A children&apos;s Communist group, known by the engaging title of &quot; Les Enfants de Lenine &quot; has been formed in Paris. This group is controlled by the third section of the Communist Party; it admits members between the ages of seven and sixteen, and has for object to train children &quot; according to the principles of the great man who is at the head of the Russian Soviet Republic and whose life is consecrated to the working classes.&quot;Laporte is said to be in charge of the Young Communist movement in France. This organisation devotes itself largely to revolutionary propaganda amongst soldiers. It has two sections, one dealing with anti-militarist propaganda and the clandestine creation of a Red
Army in each country, the other dealing with propaganda in intellectual centres and acting in common with the &quot; Clarte &quot; groups.The Communists managed at the beginning of October to secure the election of their representative, Marty, to the Paris Municipal Council as member for the Charonne district. Marty was a leader of the mutiny which took place during Armistice year on a French ship in the Black Sea, and is now serving 15 years&apos; penal servitude. A legal anomaly allowed his election, though he cannot take his seat, and it is likely that the Prefectoral Council will annul the election. Should an appeal against such a decision be finally rejected, the Communists may again put up Marty and the whole process will recommence.The French Anarchist Federation has its headquarters in Paris, and one Lecoin for its President. Its propaganda is rather weak. The Federation does not obey the injunctions of the Anarchist Inter-national of Vienna, as it is opposed to bloodshed. This gives reason to discredit the report that the Chief Executive centre of the Anarchist International has been transferred to Paris. Tlie main activity of the anarchists has been the plotting by, almost exclusively, Spanish refugee members to assassinate Spanish political personages.Miscellaneous.Commercial circles increasingly favour the resumption of economic relations with Russia.The Irish question, from being a matter of much discussion, is now having little or no effect in political circles or on public opinion.The International Textile Workers&apos; Congress, which was held in Paris during September, decided that the headquarters should remain in England and should not be transferred to a more central country. The appointment of a permanent international secretariat was discussed, among the duties for this new body being the detailed study of world markets, raw materials, and inter-trade relations between the textile producing countries. The Congress voted a sum of 200,000 francs (4,O0OZ.) to the striking textile workers of France and Belgium, and authorised the international secretary to increase the sum if the strike continued and further aid was necessary.BELGIUM.The Communists and their Debts.The Communists are showing some activity. Jacquemotte con-tinues to spread false reports of conditions in Russia; van Overstraeten, who has been appointed secretary of the Party, steadily advocates the cause of the Red Army, &quot; the backbone of the proletarian move-ment.&quot; The Party is harassed by financial difficulties. Jacquemotte owes .40,000 francs in connection with the printing and publishing of &quot; L&apos;Exploite,&quot; and van Overstraeten has press liabilities of approxi-mately 10,000 francs. These debts are making it difficult to arrange for the publication of &quot; Le Drapeau Rouge,&quot; the organ which is to replace &quot; L&apos;Exploite,&quot; and &quot; L&apos;Ouvrier Communiste,&quot; and represent the interests of the unified groups. So hard pressed are the Com-munists that they have decided to. ask Moscow for 100,000 francs to meet their debts and the initial expenses incurred in the publication of the &quot; Drapeau Rouge.&quot;   Moscow is said to have favoured this
request, and the amount asked for will be. advanced by the Western European Secretariat of the Third International.The Party has personal, as well as financial difficulties. There is no lessening of the friction between Jacquemotte and van Overstraeten, and little possibility of an understanding being reached. When the fusion of the two Communist groups has taken place the Procureur General will consider the question of proceeding against the leaders for carrying on propaganda prejudicial to the interests of the State. The delegate nominated by Moscow to attend the Communist fusion meeting is believed to be one Antoine Schlosser or Serrurier. The Belgian authorities have not yet ascertained how this man travelled to Brussels.Extremist Activities.The opening meeting of the Socialist electoral campaign was marked by Communist interruptions. Jacquemotte was eventually allowed to speak, and was replied to by M. Wanters, the Minister of Labour. W. van Overstraeten was not allowed to speak. Many persons were ejected; there were several free fights, and it is probable that the Communists will be excluded from future meetings organised by the Labour Party.An attempt is likely to be made in the near future to start a new revolutionary movement known as the &quot; Normaliste &quot; group. Klara Zetkin appears to be the originator of this movement. It is said that arrangements are being made in Germany for the dissemination of propagandist literature outlining the Internationalist and anti- j Militarist principles of the &quot; Normaliste &quot; movement. The Belgian representative is reported to be one Jobsee, a native of Liege.The International Federation of Unemployed has the various I unions of Transport Workers and the Belgian Socialist Party as distinct groups of supporters in Antwerp. The transport workers, j whose leaders are in close touch with the Industrial Workers of the I World, can be reckoned at about 30,000 men. But there are no 1 Communists or Anarchists in the group Communists, in fact, are 1 barred. The International Federation of Unemployed in Antwerp I nevertheless had for one of its leaders Abraham Soep, a Butch Jew 1 and Communist. Soep is to be expelled from Belgium on account 1 of his propaganda amongst dock labourers and merchant seamen.     1The prcyposed annual congress of the &quot; Vlaamsche Oud Strijders- I bond &quot; (Flemish ex-combatants organisation) which was to have- been 4 held in Brussels at the end of August, was abandoned, owing to the I refusal of the Burgomaster, M. Max, to permit a public demonstration. j The authorities were aware that the Congress was to be used as cover J for an attack on the policy of the Government. The Executive has I now postponed action until after the general elections, when a fresh i direction will be taken under the disguise of a &quot; parti politique.&quot;The third national congress of the Union of Railwaymen, Postal i and Marine Workers passed a resolution forbidding members to take I part in propaganda of any party which is not class war; to seek 1 secretly a political mandate and to use the title of &quot; member of the 1 Union &quot; when seeking to forward the principles of class war.Miscellaneous.Labour circles are enthusiastic over the final voting of the Eight [I Hours Day Bill by the Senate.   The Bill became law on October 1st 1
The strike at the Ougree-Marihaye Works, which is suspected to be largely due to the propaganda of Jacquemotte and his followers, drags on, notwithstanding the weariness of the workers at what they consider a trade union imposed struggle.The National Mixed Commission of Metallurgists, which met in Brussels during September, resolved that wages should be reduced by 5 per cent, from November ist next, but that wages of men under 21 should not be touched.The &quot; Trade Union Week &quot; of Morlanwelz was marked by anti-- socialist demonstrations against the presence of the German delegate, Sassenbach.B. P. Wadia, the Indian trade unionist, has been visiting Belgium. He was invited by the Belgian Labour Party to speak in various towns, but his speeches have dealt with religious topics. A campaign is now being carried on in Belgium to spread the views of the &quot; Theo-sophical Society.&quot;The second triennial PanAfrican Congress has taken place in Brussels under the presidency of M. Blaise Diagne, a coloured French Deputy from Senegal. The object of the Congress was to promote education, hygiene and industry among the negro people, with the collaboration and experience of the great colonising nations.ITALY.Relations with the Soviet Another Hitch.There is yet another hitch in the negotiations for a commercial agreement with Russia. Vorowsky, the Soviet emissary, now claims the diplomatic right to say that the commercial couriers may carry to Italy sealed parcels up to 15 kilos in weight, whereas six kilos was the limit previously agreed to. The point seems not unduly important, the immunity of the couriers being admitted, and it is surmised that the delay in the signature is due to some &quot;other cause. The Italian delegate, Bobbiano Pico, is in Moscow dealing with other matters.&apos; These include the establishment of a regular boat service between Trieste and Odessa, the delivery to Russia of Italian-built locomotives and freight cars of the tank pattern, with a view to permitting the export of Russian naptha, and a scheme for the emigration to Russia of Italian peasants. Emigration is necessary, since Italy has now no outlet for her population to the United States, and it is said that the Soviet will make a free grant of land for agricultural purposes. But it is difficult to understand why emigration to Russia should be spoken of at the present moment.Socialist and Communist Movements.The Social Reformists are busily preparing for the Milan Congress, though there is now little doubt of a Maximalist victory. Every effort will be made to maintain party unity. According to Signor Turati, the Congress will be useless, and the Reformists have also convened a congress. The Maximalist section of the Socialist Party has decided that it cannot collaborate with the Government, while the present regime and economic conditions exist. Moscow had chosen Luna-charsky as its representative at the Congress, but the Government refused to allow him admission to the country.Lazzarfs refusal to confer with the United Communists implies his opposition to them, and his decision to propose, at the Milan
ioCongress, unconditional adhesion to Moscow and detachment from the Reformists, will compel the United Communists to define their position- They must stand against or with the Reformists, against or with the Third International.The Executive Committee of the Third International has meanwhile informed the Socialist Party leaders that if the forthcoming Congress adopts the 21 points and proves its sincerity by expelling the Reform-ists from the Party, the Moscow Executive will consider as removed the principal obstacle to the admission of the Italian Socialist Part3&apos; to the International.The Press has published particulars of the Communist propaganda which aims at subverting the Army and the Constitution. Communist propaganda in the Army is to be furthered by the familiar method of forming Communist groups in each regiment, each platoon having its propagandist, and secret regimental Committees being formed to ensure the transmission and execution of orders.Labour Unrest.The general strike threatened in Rome as a protest against the excesses of the Fascisti was put off. The Labour Federation announced that the mere threat of a strike had produced an effect, and the Execu-tive Committee was empowered to call the strike immediately if necessary. The opposition of the Socialists may account in great measure for the averting of the strike.The lock out in the yards of the Triestine Navigation Company was followed by a general strike as protest. The Company is alleged to have locked out its men in order to obtain from the Government a higher subvention for shipbuilding than is decreed by law. The strike ended with the reaching of an agreement between the Govern-ment and the company, though not before there had been street battles between Fascisti, Communists and Republicans.Miscellaneous.It is thought that one of the decisions reached by the Anarchists at their secret International Conference at Trieste during August was to bring about a general strike in Italy as soon as possible and to undertake various acts of terrorism.D&apos;Aragona, the Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour, has declared that a national loan of 200,000,0001., guaranteed by the State, must be raised in order to meet the problem of unemployment. The Parliamentary Socialist Party is agitating for the immediate convocation of Parliament.The machinations of Hugo Stinnes in Italy include active financial support of the Nitti papers, with the object of forming a nwespaper trust. Stinnes means to turn public opinion in favour of Nitti, and so bring about a change in Italy&apos;s foreign policy. He is working through Senator Dante Ferraria, late Minister of Commerce under Nitti. Commendantore Magno, Nittfs late head of Cabinet, is direct-ing this journalistic combine under Senator Ferraria. The &quot; Paese &quot; has been captured; the &quot; Epoca &quot; will follow shortly, and a new evening paper called the &quot; Mondo &quot; is to be launched. The Palermo paper &quot; L&apos;0ra &quot; already forms part of the combine.
SPAIN.The General Situation.The talk of a general strike has so far remained talk only. The attempt made at Bilbao to initiate such a strike, as a protest against the methods of the Civil Governor, failed. Labour is disorganised; the country is rent with the local jealousies peculiar to Spain, which prevent any concerted movement; and no real leader of men has so far appeared. Letters to the French textile workers, signed by Pedro Alvarez and one Garcia, secretary of the Textile and Agricultural Communist Trades Unions of Madrid, state that Spain is on the eve of a big Communist revolutionary movement, which may break out at any moment.   These two men are in close touch with Victor Kopp.To the activities of the Sindicato Unico have succeeded in large measure the parallel methods of the Sindicato Libre, which is gathering to itself the members of the Sindicato Unico. The rank and file lose nothing by the change, but the leaders suffer severely. Meanwhile, the Syndicalist leaders are in hiding, and Barcelona has temporarily resigned the leadership of Labour in Spain. Funds are low, and what little money is collected is being spent in paying for assassinations, leaving none with which to put up a real fight. Some money is said to be arriving from Germany, being remitted to a certain business house in Valencia.Meanwhile the Confederation of Labour is actively undermining the restraining influence hitherto exercised by the Socialists of the Union General de Trabaj adores, and the moderates are being steadily ousted by the wild men. The revolutionaries have had the wit to set their energies to an anti-militarist campaign, which offers them their most promising field. The considerable discontent in the Army has not been lessened by recent events.Pursuing their measures of repression, the police have raided the offices of &quot;El Communista,&quot; arrested Torrent, the editor, and stopped the publication of the paper. Another journal, &quot; El Nuevo Orden,&quot; has, however, replaced &quot; El Communista.&quot;PORTUGAL.Revolutionary Movements.The creation of a secret Labour police of Bolshevik inclinations, under one Joaquim Cardoso, is a recent undertaking of the C.G.T. These police are to watch the official police and bribe them when necessary. The desperate labour situation in the provinces, where famine, incredible as it may seem in a country of the agricultural possibilities of Portugal, has appeared, provides the best of oppor-tunities for revolutionary propaganda, which has not so far been attempted. The Government could hardly settle a revolution of misery without the aid of the Army, given the local sympathies of the provincial Republican guards. A revolution in Lisbon could only be brought about by political causes, but its advent might be the signal for the revolt of the afflicted provinces.Symptoms of unrest are multiplying. Early in September the Prime Minister asked the chiefs of the Opposition Parties, the Democrats and Reconstituents for their co-operation against two revolutionary movements which were, he alleged, being organised,
12tho first by the Populars with the help of certain disgruntled democrats and socialists, the second by the Monarchists, with the object of setting up a military dictatorship paving the way for the restoration. The newspapers have since announced the suppression of yet another revolutionary movement, which aimed at uniting the various discontented civil and military elements. There was no fighting, but some arrests were made. The Government denies that the Navy is implicated.Some members of a Society called the &quot; National Nucleus of Communistic Youth &quot; have been arrested for distributing literature inciting to an immediate Communist revolution. The authorities do not over-estimate the importance of their doings, but many Portuguese are alarmed at the Communist propaganda among the soldiers of the Republican Guard, the chief bulwark of order.Labour Troubles.A recent trial of Lisbon was a two days&apos; strike of waiters and servants. The strike was originated by Jose Sanchez, a troublesome Spaniard, whose next move may be amongst the bricklayers, butchers, or any other class, unless he is once more expelled from Portugal.Under threats of a strike, postal and telegraph officials are demanding more money.2. SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES.NORWAY.The Russo-Norwegian Treaty Ratified.The Storthing has ratified the commercial treaty between Norway and Russia, not without criticism by the Conservative leaders, who described the treaty as unsatisfactory from a business standpoint and dangerous politically. A Norwegian commercial delegation of twenty members will be sent to Russia, and a Russian commercial delegation, headed by Michailoff, will arrive in Christiania shortly.The Treaty binds the contracting parties to abstain from any political action against each other and stipulates that commerce between Russia and Norway can only go on through the Commissariat of External Trade, or with its consent. The territorial frontier is fixed at ten miles.Trade with Russia will probably be seriously hindered by the declaration of the Russian agent, Captain Bokowsky,&quot; that Russia will henceforth claim an import duty of 15 per cent, of the goods, this duty affecting both fish and goods sent by the Red Cross.An Aftermath of the Strike.A general meeting of the Central and District Committees of the Norwegian Organisation of Trade Unions appears to have pacified Ole Lian and Elias Volan, the chairman and vice-chairman of that body, who were accused of bad faith with the men during the big strike.   At any rate, these officials retain their positions.The whitewashing of them is said not to meet with the approval of many of the rank and file, but the meeting, which was not a general delegate meeting, had no power to throw out the leaders.
The Norwegian Organisation of Trade Unions is to remain .for the present in the Amsterdam International, the final decision being postponed until the next National General Meeting, which, it is suggested, should not take place before 1923, though this decision will very probably be over-ruled. In the meantime, a referendum of members will be taken. This decision should not be taken to mean that extremism has had a serious set back. There is no noteworthy diminution of revolutionary sentiment, but there is dissatisfaction at the dictation of Moscow and the rigid control of the Red Trade Union International. Revolutionary ideals are tending to syndicalism and anarchism, but the change has not yet taken any concrete form. It is felt that unity is essential in view of the coming wages fight and that the Red International cannot yet give as effective support as may be expected from the Amsterdam International. The Amsterdam International still reigns in Europe generally and the secession of Norwegian Labour will deprive it of financial assistance during strikes and lockouts. The Norwegian Labour Party is said to have infor-mation that the Employers&apos; Federations of the chief continental countries have recently come to an agreement regarding the reduction of wages. If this is a fact it is natural that the Norwegian Organisation of Trade Unions should prefer to retain for the present its connection with Amsterdam rather than go over to Moscow.The Government and Revolution.The Government is said to have decided upon various secret defensive preparations against revolution or Russian aggression. The garrisons of the chief towns are to be kept permanently at the present strength to which they were increased as an emergency measure at the beginning of the recent big strike, so long as any risk of revolution remains. A &quot; White Guard &quot; national volunteer force is to be secretly introduced. No money has been asked for from Parliament, but it is possible that some of the funds required will be obtained under camouflage as grants to the Sporting Associations and Rifle Clubs.The Young Communists.The Young Communists have decided to organise a campaign among their &quot; pious friends &apos;&quot; who are at present restrained by religious scruples from embracing Communism. No decision has, however, been taken as to how the campaign is to be carried out.The anti-militarist agitation is also to be continued. It is reported in this connection that over 60 per cent, of the present class of recruits, who belong to organised labour, are influenced by the Revolutionary Military Committee, and would be unreliable in the event of an attempt at revolution. Speakers at a recent gathering of Young Communists emphasised that &quot; Soldiers&apos; Councils &quot; must be established and that the existence of Soviet power in Russia was only possible through its continued control of the army.An appeal made by Communist students to the Young Communists for financial help in starting their own Communist newspaper has been refused, on the ground that the Young Communists are almost penniless.Many young people between 14 and 16 years of age are said to be employed as Communist spies in Christiania.
Communism: Miscellaneous.Communist agitation is said to be spreading in the country districts, with satisfactory results from the revolutionary point of view. It has been suggested that Communist groups should be formed in the country market towns.The Transport Workers have decided to form their own Communist group.The reports that Folkets Hus intends to work definitely for the occupation of the factories are strengthened by a recent decision of the bookbinders to take over the factories at the first suitable oppor-tunity. The Ghristiania Iron Workers&apos; Committee of Action and the Electrical Mechanics&apos; Union have also debated this subject, but their decision is not yet known.Mbscow has ordered that the tramway conductors who, took part in the recent strike shall wear a badge in testimony of their orthodox Bolshevism. The holders of the badge are to carry on propaganda exclusively among the tramway employees, so that the tramways can be taken over when the time is ripe for action. This system is being adopted in several other industries.Extremists and Government Officials.Government employees have decided not to vote for any of the non-Socialist parties at the forthcoming Parliamentary elections, and have protested against any attempt to abolish bonuses or to reduce salaries. The employees as a whole are very exasperated and deter -mined to insist on drastic reforms. Various informants consider that the prevailing unrest amongst the officials is a greater danger than anyone not in the confidence of these men suspects. The Norwegian Labour Party is making a special point of getting information from officials as to what is going on at their offices in return for promises of assistance. It is reported that there seems to be some leakage of information, through Communist postal employees, from the Christiania Post Office to Folkets Hus. Such a leakage, it is hinted, conveyed information of the ruse adopted by the Employers&apos; Union during the recent big strike of sending lorries driven by volunteers through the streets, these lorries being loaded with empty boxes in order to make it appear that transport was in better working order than was actually the case.The Unemployment Problem.A conference between CO. Tangen, the well-known syndicalist-anarchist agitator, and the chief members of the Norwegian unemployed, took place during September. The programme discussed had a singular resemblance in certain points to that advocated in other countries : for instance, work or maintenance at full pay and demands made en masse at institutions working for the benefit of the poor.The Governments proposals for relief have caused dissatisfaction. They included a promise to pay a wage of Kr. 12 a day to each unemployed worker who might be employed by any official body on emergency work. A national committee of unemployed is suggested, and, for their part, the Danish and Swedish unemployed are proposing the formation of a Scandinavian Unemployed Union. -.
ISSWEDEN.Communist Exploitation of the Unemployed.The disquieting extent of unemployment may be judged by the fact that in the paper mills alone the number of unemployed approaches 60 per cent, as compared with 33  per cent, at the end of May.   Some 12,000 unemployed men are at present working on the State domains, and about 20,000 are receiving unemployment allowances.   The decision of the Unemployment Commission to reduce the wages paid to the workers on the State domains caused great dissatisfaction and was followed by strikes at some places in the Stockholm district.   The Commission thereupon decided that strikers who had not resumed work by a certain date should be dismissed and disqualified from receiving unemployment allowances.   This situation has not un-naturally been exploited by the Communists, who arranged that a &quot; congress &quot; of unemployed should be held in Stockholm at the end of August.   The Trade Unions sent delegates, but the chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions, Herr Thorberg, finding that the representatives of the unions could have no influence on the decisions, left the meeting and was followed by most of the Trade Union delegates.   A deputation sent by the conference to the Government made  thoroughly unreasonable  demands.    These included claims that the State works for the relief of unemployment should be con-trolled by the workers themselves, that the State Unemployment Commission should be abolished and that an extraordinary session of the Riksdag should be summoned to vote further grants for the relief of unemployment.   A demand was also made that unemployment allowances should be large enough to cover entirely the cost of living. These demands were refused, although some hopes of possible &quot; modi-fications &quot; in the scale of wages were held out.   The &quot; congress &quot; thereupon resolved to picket all work on the State domains as from the 4th September, and issued a manifesto addressed to the Swedish workers, demanding that large estates as well as Crown and municipal lands should be parcelled into workmen&apos;s holdings, and that &quot; com-plete relations &quot; be established with Soviet Russia.   The chairman of the State Unemployment Commission has since declared that the Commission intends to dismiss the strikers and to engage other unemployed workers in their places.   Should the latter refuse to accept the work offered them they will be disqualified from receiving unemployment allowances.   It is, however, doubtful whether the strike and picketing are likely to be effective.   The result of the congress has been to embarrass very seriously the social democrat leaders of the Trade Unions, who are now being decried by the Communists as traitors to the cause. &apos; The Communists are advertising themselves as the friends and supporters of the workers.The chief movers behind the unemployed agitation have been, not Scandinavian, but the German Syndicalists. There is an intimate connection between the Central European and Scandinavian Labour movements, especially in regard to Syndicalism and Anarchism. Scandinavia has yielded willing supporters of the suggestion that the old organisations should be broken up and an independent Anarchist-Syndicalist International formed.0   10100 ]S
What are called &quot; loafer congresses &quot; or meetings of revolutionary -minded unemployed are again being arranged after a period of qui-escence due to police interruption. The revolutionaries have reorga-nised themselves, are seeking new adherents, and intend to use discretion, holding congresses in the smaller towns.Relations with Russia.The new commercial treaty between Sweden and the Russian Soviet has not yet been ajDproved, and a decision is unlikely before the new Cabinet is formed. Commercial circles are showing them-selves very suspicious.Kerjentseff has declared that Sweden must accept the conditions of the Norwegian trade treaty, adding menacingly that if she refuses commercial relations between Russia and Sweden will be broken off. He complains that the Swedish Government has not so far responded to the Bolshevik invitation to negotiate a new treaty.Russian Gold.The S..S. &quot; Egil &quot; arrived in Stockholm at the end of July and unloaded 200 cases of gold in roubles, each case valued at 150,000 kr. and consigned to the Skandinaviska Kredit Aktiebolag in Stockholm. This is the largest consignment received so far. Competent opinion inclines to believe that this gold is not for re-exportation to Switzerland, Holland and France, but for the payment of locomotives ordered by the Russian Soviet in Sweden and from Krupps in Germany..The Nordiska Handelsbanken, Stockholm, has been commissioned by Litvinoff to credit the Svenska Handelsbanken, Stockholm, with 1,000,000 dollars to the order of &quot; Vertretung Volkskommissariats Auswiirtigen Handel Soviet Russlands, Reval/&apos; and has asked the National Bank of Commerce in New York to credit the Svenska Bank&apos;s account with the above-mentioned sum. Litvinoff sent cover from Reval to the Nordiska Bank in Russian gold roubles, amounting to 2,000,000.Miscellaneous.Dock labourers and employers have accepted the proposal of the Arbitration Commission for a decrease of 20 per cent, in wages.There are in the country three industrial concerns in which no work can be undertaken without calhng the workshop council into conference. They are Helsingborg&apos;s Rubber Factory, Uddeholms Ltd., and Svano Bruk.The Swedish volunteer rifle clubs now number 2,127 with 139,561 members. Membership largely increased during 1920-21 owing chiefly to fears of revolution. The Swedish Parliament is considering a proposal to vote a subsidy to the rifle clubs for the year 1922, and is said to have decided gradually to develop the rifle clubs into a kind of militia.Little that is new has been revealed concerning the Communist plot. The Public Prosecutor is of opinion that Jacobsen-Heikkinen was the leader of an organisation which had been scheming not only to assist the Finnish revolutionaries, but also to set on foot a revolt in Sweden.
j DENMARK.I Communism.I Communist propaganda, which has greatly increased of late, has won many adherents for the party, which is now said to have over 40,000 members, though it is probable that many of these are to be found among the unemployed. The Communists are working hard to capture government and municipal employees and youths shortly due for military service. A special committee of six, with Edward Jensen as president, has been appointed to combat anti-Bolshevik organisations. The Social Democrat Party is, if possible, to be broken up, and its members absorbed by the Communist Party. It is reported that the Danish Communist Party, which does not wish to leave the Third International, has decided not to be represented at the Conference to be held in Germany to consider the founding of a new International.Help for Russia.Acting on the request of the Danish Communist Party, the Jewish I Tailors&apos; Union and the Bund invited all Jewish organisations and j unions in Denmark to a conference at which the question of assisting a Russia would be discussed. The invitation was declined by most of I the Jewish organisations, which, while they are not averse from helping Russia, will have nothing to do with the Tailors&apos; Union and I the Bund. These bodies have now turned to the Jewish labourers, jfrom whom they are recruiting a help committee, and they have j announced that assistance is to be given to Russian Communists only.The Danish Relief expedition to Petrograd has been suspended f because the Soviet will permit five Danish representatives only, jinstead of 15, to enter Russia. These are allowed to act only in the j Volga districts. The Foreign Minister considers that these conditions make it impossible to ensure that food and clothes will really be I distributed to destitute children. Only when such a guarantee is jgiven can the committee be entitled to use the Danish Governments &quot;grants.3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HOLLAND.jA Communist Split.The Dutch Communist Party has gone the way of others and has ^definitely split. The three leaders of the party, Wynkoop, Sneevliet arid Van Leuven, had had differences over the conduct of Wyrikoop jit the Congress of the Third International, and a breach developed .over the publication, of a book by Van Leuven, criticising Wynkoop. jVan Leuven has now broken with the party and has joined the extremist section in which De Gorter, Professor Pannekock and ;Mrs. Roland Hoist are united.IThe new Independent Communist Workmen&apos;s Party may be assed under the same category as the K.A.P.D. in Germany. It ijects to the - dictatorship of Moscow and does not agree entirely th Third.International principles. But it is for the present without eat importance. O   16156 c
Miscellaneous.The proposed Dutch Anarchist Congress will take place in October at The Hague.No section of the International Federation of Unemployed appears to exist in Holland.The scheme of one A. De Boo, of Rotterdam, for publishing a journal to be called &quot; Guide for the Netherlands and the Colonies,&quot; has already been mentioned in the Review. It collapsed, however, owing to the dishonesty of A. F. J. Koch, who was De Boo&apos;s principal assistant and during the war an agent of the German S.S. in Holland. De Boo has now decided to publish a trade journal in English under the name of &quot; Holland-Recorder,&quot; financed apparently by himself without German capital. As regards the &quot; International Journal,&quot; which was to represent the interests of a German syndicate, no trace of this syndicated activities in Holland have been discovered. It may be that Koch was their man, and got into touch with De Boo in order to exploit him, with the result that Koch&apos;s swindling has caused the scheme to fall through.GERMANY.Communist Prospects and Policy.The recent International Communist meeting at Jena is said to have been followed by a private meeting of leaders. As lines of general policy it was decided to make local and national labour trouble in various countries subservient to the common purpose of starting a simultaneous world revolution in the late spring of 1922. The general unemployment and the attempts to reduce wages are to be used as a lever the world over, and the brain workers and state employees are to be won for revolution. A more efficient courier and secret service is to be established.In connection with unemployment the Third International has rebuked the German section of the .West European Secretariat for its delay in helping the organisations founded to help the unemployed. It should be noted that the United Communist Party (V.K.P.D.) is now proposing to group the unemployed according to their callings. The connection of the International Union of Unemployed with the Third International is not denied, and the Secretariat is instructed to devote all its efforts to helping the members of the Union, which &quot; may become one of the secret ramifications of our organisation in the West and serve as a base for the future work of the Secretariat.&quot; A supple-mentary sum of 220,000 Swedish crowns is to be given to the Secretariat for the purpose of helping institutions connected with the International Union&apos;of Unemployed.To meet the needs of the United Communist Party, Germany is divided into 28 districts, with fixed boundaries. The formation of larger groups, such as the Rhine industrial region, the Middle German region, etc., has been suggested by the Third International, and the &quot; Central &quot; has resolved to establish a Supreme Council over certain industrial regions. These Supreme Council are designated as Political and Organisation Commissariats, and are not required to do any petty work. The general structure of. the party is one of minute subdivision fining down to local groups of ten, of which each; member is to be a propagandist and informant.
It has been stated by Wurenbrandt, of the V.P.K.D. that the pro gress. of revoluntary propaganda depends substantially on agitation among German sailors, who have already received considerable atten-tion from Reich. Only through them can the Russian proletariat win support for an internatinal revoluntary movement. There is said, however, to be little prospect of a Communist Putsch. Should such a move come from the Right, the Left would probably counter it by a general strike. This, according to a Communist leader, is the only weapon left to the workers, who have learnt a lesson from the March rising and are without arms and ammunition.The United Communist Party (V.K.P.D.) in Greater Berlin appears to have abandoned its former battle organisations in favour of an Arbeiterwehr organised in individual factories according to the well-known 10-men group system. Several factories are grouped to form a Bezirk. The presumed leader of the Arbeiterwehr, which is, of course, an illegal organisation, is the notorious Friesland alias Reuter; membership is confined exclusively to reliable persons.Generally speaking Communist influence appears to be declining. The United Communist Party in Saxony is reported to have lost both numbers and the rowdy elements which might have been attracted to it as a result of events in neighbouring middle Germany. In Southern Bavaria the United Communist Party (V.K.P.D.) has lost all influence&quot;; in the Northern area it is, however, making considerable progress under Steimer, Boyer and Mayer. The Remscheid branch is said to be preparing vigorously for a general strike. Workers are being urged to press for a factory council meeting and influence it to decide either for an increase of wages or a strike.Epstein has been elected political organiser and chairman of the committee of the Rhenish branch of the United Communist Party. Mieves is the general organiser, and Sehnbruch will co-operate and negotiate with the trade unions. The Committee counts eleven members.The Communist Workers Party (K.A.P.D.).The Communist Workers Party (K.A.P.D.) started their campaign for the founding of a new Communist International by circulating 200,000 copies of an appeal to the various Communist parties which are dissatisfied with the Third International. It is hoped to capture the Dutch and Bulgarian Left Communist Parties, the Spanish syndicates-calists, the Glasgow group of Communists and Communist groups in Belgium, Luxemburg and Mexico, andtheI.W.W. The party has lost considerably in members, who now number not more than 12,000 in the whole of Berlin. Other K.A.P.D. strongholds, particularly in Rhineland, Westphalia and Thuringia, have also weakened. The shrinkage of the K.A.P.D. to a politically uninfluential sect was to be expected in consequence of its secession from Moscow. Many members are drifting to the V.K.P.D. The creation of a Communist Work-men^ International is in preparation, and an office has been opened to this end in Berlin. It is further treated of in an article in Part II. of this number.Action against &quot;Die Rote Fahne.&quot;Certain Communist organs have been reprimanded for their attacks on the Government and the Republic, and &quot; Die Rote Fahne &quot; itself was suppressed from September 15th to September 17th.   The tonec 2
of &quot; Die Rote Fahne&quot; has become markedly less violent, affairs demanding that the paper should not be stopped at the present critical juncture. Moscow has backed its approval of this change of tactics by the gift of a large sum of money.The temporary suppression of &quot; Die Rote Fahne &quot; seems to have been chiefly due to the publication by that organ of a letter written by Dr. Weissmann to the Cabinet,.in which Dr. Weissmann proposed to organise a secret Intelligence Service at the German Provision Station in Moscow and at the branch in Petrograd. This move has for object to counteract the activities of the German Workers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Councils which have existed since the November revolution in Petrograd and Moscow, and to get control over the illegal entry into Germany of Communist leaders. Weissmann pointed out that after a close examination of the special orders issued by the Foreign Office concerning the legal entry of Russian Commissars into Germany, it was necessary that special precautions should be taken.Communist Aid for Russia.The United Communist Party (V.K.P.D.) has created a &quot; Work-men&apos;s Help for Soviet Russia &quot; throughout Germany in addition to the &quot; Rothehilfe,&quot; and is making a &quot; Famine &quot; collection throughout all classes, not obtruding Communism in this connection. This move-ment has been far from successful. From Moscow comes a communi-cation describing the help given as a &quot;&apos; drop in the sea,&quot; and calling for greater energy and less diffusion of purpose. The workers are exhorted to give their earnings on November 7th, the anniversary of the Russian Revolution, to the famine victims.The Bolsheviks and Upper Silesia.The Russian Soviet, meaning to utilize the disturbances arranged by Korfanty in Upper Silesia, has decided to intensify agitation in Germany by sending a large number of agitators there. These people, mostly Jews, registered as professors, scientists and artists, are living in the Communist quarters in Berlin, awaiting their new work. Noi. Borowski, the Bolshevik agitator, reached Berlin during July at the head of a supposed trade delegation consisting of five Bolshevik spies.The situation for the Bolsheviks in Upper Silesia is said, however, to have become considerably worse. Weger, of the West European Secretariat, is emphasising that the Bolsheviks should transfer their attention to Teschen, and obtain direct touch with the Eastern Galician centres, where complications may shortly arise.Soviet Personnel in Germany.Victor Kopp has been finally released from his duties as represen-tative of the Soviet Government and will henceforth be general Pleni-plenipotentiary of the Russian Red Cross at Berlin. Krestinski, the Soviet Commissary for Finance, now represents the Soviet Government in Berlin.   He attended the recent Congress of the V.K.P.D. at Jena.Bolshevik officials who have arrived in Germany include Rykov, Chief of the Soviet of People&apos;s Economy, and Lezhava, of the Corn-mission for Foreign Trade.Relations with Russia.r--Dr. Wiedenfeld, of the German Foreign Office, the German Cdm-mercial representative under the Trade Agreement with the Soviet,
left for Russia early in September. His preliminary activities are to include an exact enquiry into the question of transport between Germany and Russia.A certain Deutsehrnan, special accredited representative of the German Ministry for Foreign Affairs, passed through Helsingfors during August on his way to Moscow, with instructions to make a hurried report and return after a few days&apos; visit. Deutschman, who was in Moscow with Mirbach and in Kiev with Skoropadski, was at pains to represent that he was very anti-Bolshevik.The Soviet Mission in Berlin has informed Tchitcherin that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs refuses to give visas for leaving and return-ing to Germany to Russian officials who are being sent temporarily to Russia and other countries. The reason for this refusal is that the Soviet Mission does not give return visas, and until Soviet rules are changed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot alter its latest decision.The Industrials and Russia.German financiers and heavy industrials are said to have decided as a general attitude, to follow Great Britain&apos;s policy. They are determined to do business with England at any price. Their attitude towards Russia is determined by German necessities. The high currency prevents the purchase of raw materials, oil, etc., abroad; the vast resources of Russia remain the only other source of supply  hence the decision of the industrials to start great transactions with Russia at great risks. The industrials would prefer to work in co-operation with England, but if England does not come in they will proceed alone. An important group proposes to come to London to discuss with the heads of British banking and industry the formation of an International -Corporation, mainly for the purpose of dealing with Russia, but also with other countries. It is also mentioned that the Association of German Locomotive Manufacturers has agreed to make a working arrangement for two years with the option of another two years with a British group of locomotive builders. Orders will be divided and an average price will be quoted, so that both parties will get the market prices of their respective countries. Germany&apos;s need of Russia explains the recent decision.of the Government to give every facility to the Soviet Government and to remove most of the restrictions on Soviet authorities and their officials, as well as the instructions to the German Home Office to turn a blind eye upon Bolshevik activities.Oriental Agitation.A branch of the Pan-Islamic Committee exists in Munich, recruited from amongst the Turks and Egyptians in that city. Sheik Abdel Aziz Shawish, whose headquarters are at Berlin, is president.A violently anti-British pan-oriental periodical called &quot; Freiheit des Ostens &quot; has recently appeared in Berlin. It advocates the des-truction of British power in the East with the help of Germany. The Editor is Sheik Abdur Rahman Seif, a member of the League of Oppressed Peoples.There is evidence that one Mohammed Ragheb, possibly identical with an Egyptian medical student who was formerly in London but who applied last April for a permit to return to Egypt, has been in Cologne&apos;, where he was in touch with the Egyptian National Party in
Berlin. These people were asking him for the addresses of local sympathisers to whom they might send their publications.It is reported under reserve that the Pan-Islamist Committee in Berlin are continuing their investigations as to the possibilities of the plan for the use of bacilli and poison bombs against the British in India. Couriers between Berlin and Moscow now go via Angora, owing to difficulties in getting them through Constantinople. It has been made clear that active support is not to be expected from Germany at the present moment.Miscellaneous.The belief is prevalent that the Government will soon grant a substantial increase in the wages of the railway workers. The lower grades of these men are admittedly very badly paid.Little success appears to have attended the activities of Smeets, the chief leader of the Rhineland Republican movement. Smeets is looked upon as a political adventurer, taking French pay for French ends.The German Government has refused a visa to Arthur MacManus, the Chairman of the British Communist Party, who is seeking to travel to Russia and who wished to break his journey in Germany in order to take part in a proletarian Help-Russia Conference. MacManus is now trying to travel via Norway, but the issue of a Norwegian visa is dependent on the Swedish decision in the matter.Preparations are being made, apparently at the instigation of the &quot; Unione Anarchica Italiana &quot; in Bologna, to hold an international Anarchist Congress in Germany, either in Berlin or Hamburg. Nego-tiations are taking place between Bologna and Berlin.The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; alleges that there is evidence that, through the medium of Pierpont Morgan, a satisfactory portion of shares in the Stinnes enterprises has been sold to French banks. Hitherto Stinnes has found his efforts to obtain a coal supply for the Montana Iron Works everywhere blocked by the French.All politicians of opposition circles are said to declare that no disbandment of the Einwohnerwehren has really taken place. The Society &quot; Notbann,&quot; a technical emergency corps founded in Munich during June, has adopted all the functions and characteristics of the Einwohnerwehr, and has for its chief men those of the late Munich Einwohnerwehr. There is alleged to be some connection between certain Alpine Clubs and the Notbann.The Swinemuende authorities recently prevented the Soviet Red Cross steamer &quot; Transbaltic &quot; from landing crew and officers, having learned that they intended to carry on Bolshevik espionage and propaganda at Stettin. At Hamburg there has been serious trouble with the steamer &quot; Argun &quot; of the Jelo line (which line also trades with the United Kingdom through Norway) on account of smuggling Bolshevik money and agitators into Germany. The steamer was loaded and partly manned by the Soviet Government.The Public Prosecutor at Leipzig has issued a warrant for the arrest of Kapp and Luttwitz, the leaders of the attempted monarchist &quot; putsch &quot; last year.Dr. F. A. R. von Strensch is reported to be again in New York, collecting funds for an alleged scheme for helping German ex-officers by settling them on the land in Germany.   The movement is supported
by the ex-Kaiser and General von Mackensen, and has for real pupose to use the officers, under tho guise of overseers on large estates, to form monarchist military formations amongst the workers.SWITZERLAND.The Prospects of Communism: a Split.Communist activity has revived, particularly in Geneva. It has so far shown itself in an intensification of propaganda and in the overhauling of the party organisation, and may be due to instructions from Moscow that the still pool of Swiss Communism is to bestirred. The Communists aim apparently at the creation of a uniform organisa-tion for the whole of the country, to be controlled indirectly from headquarters at Basle, through various local Centrales.The Communist Party in French Switzerland is now centred in Geneva, and the various sections have been informed that they now depend on Geneva and must put themselves into communication with the new secretary of the party, Emile Schaulen, the successor of Humbert-Droz, who has become a secretary of the Executive Committee of the Third International. The Geneva Communists are somewhat alarmed at the intention of the Union Syndicate de Geneve to found a workmen&apos;s paper in competition with the Communist organ &quot; L&apos;Avant Garde,&quot; which, in spite of every effort to extend its circulation, is still published at a loss, and can scarcely face corn-petition.The various efforts towards unity have, however, been seriously hampered by a quarrel between the Communist State Councillor Schneider and the other members of the Basle section of the Communist Party. Schneider, who has been gradually turning to the right, seceded from the party at the end of August, together with some of his immediate followers. Matters had been brought to a head by Schneider&apos;s disapproval of the action of the Communist Party during the counter-demonstrations organised on the Swiss National Festival. The secession has since been made absolute &quot;by the expulsion, however reluctant, of Schneider and his friends from the party and their decision to form a party of their own, called the Independent Swiss Communist Party (Unabhangige Kommunistische Partei der Schweiz). The Socialists seem to have angled patiently to recapture Schneider. The new party proposes to establish a newspaper of its own. It is ambitious of founding sections in all the principal towns of the Confederation, but its prospects of longevity are slight and reconciliation and re-union with the Communist Party are probable.Communist Schemes and Activities.The efforts of the Communists to call an extraordinary Congress of the Trade Unions have at last been successful. The Congress has for object to establish &quot; unity of front &quot;; the preparations for it will occupy the workmen&apos;s circles in Switzerland during the next few months. The cost of the Congress, which cannot take place before the end of the year, is put at about 60,000 francs. The prospects of attaining unity at front, in the Communist interpretation, are poor just now, and it is likely that the Communists will suffer a great defeat.
The &quot; Societe de Gymnastique du Grutli,&quot; a club formed of dissident Socialist and Communist members of the Gymnastic Societies which adhered to the Union Civique Suisse after the general strike of November 1918, is now composed of extremists, and has lately formed a subsection at Versoix, called &quot; Les Amis Gymnastes.&quot; Workmen, however, prefer to join the non-political societies, because otherwise they cannot compete in the Cantonal and Federal meetings. On the other hand, many bourgeois societies have left the Union Civique, in order to remain completely neutral in political matters.A secret meeting held in Zurich by 28 Workmen &apos;s Unions and attended by a member of the Executive Committee of the Third International decided that revolutionary propaganda must be carried out on economic and social lines. A fight against wage reductions is indicated.The demonstrations early in September projected as a counter-blast to the decision of the Federal Council not to afford material help to Russia were ruined by the weather, and by the police prohibi-tion of the sale of flowers and post cards by unauthorised persons. The Communists were left with 10,000 unsold post cards on their hands, and have had to admit that not more than 301. was raised by their endeavours.So apathetic were the Lausanne Communists towards the recent &quot; Week of Agitation &quot; that only with great difficulty were two men found willing to paste revolutionary placards on the walls. All other comrades refused.The French Communist delegates appear to have been instructed by the Third International to pass through Geneva on their return to France, with the mission of studying the possibility of transforming the Communist centre at Geneva into a more powerful organisation, whose chief objects would be to fight against the influence of the League of Nations and the International Labour Office. They were, however, forbidden to enter Switzerland.The Congress of the Swiss Socialist (Social-Democratic) Party, which was held at Lucerne early in September, decided to adhere to the Vienna International. During the period 1918-1920 the member-ship of the party has risen from 39,000 to 54,000. The Congress was attended by Friedrich Adler, of Vienna, Dr. Rosenfeld, of Berlin, and by delegates from Georgia.Miscellaneous.Jules Humbert-Droz, with his wife and children, has gone to Russia via. Germany.   It is not known how he crossed the frontier.Three persons, named Abdul Hak Hamid, Abdul Aziz Chaouick and Ismael Kamel, are said to be at Montreux, actively agitating against British predominance in Egypt. Chaouick has for some time been concerned with Egyptian intrigues in Holland and Switzerland.Kerran or Kehrhahn, who was refused admission to Switzerland for the Basle Co-operative Congress as the representative of a Russian Co-operative Society, but who finally got in as holding a mandate from a British Co-operative, has now gone to Germany. He was very intimate with Robert Dell, formerly of the &quot; Manchester Guardian&quot; and with Mrs. Polowtzew, who came from London to represent the Arcos.
AUSTRIA.Communist Activities.The Soviet Mission in Vienna has established a regular political and information bureau which is under the direction of Mostovenko, the Soviet representative in Prague. About 130 people are employed and use their positions as representatives of various Viennese commercial houses as a pretext for travelling. The activities of this bureau extend to Jugo-Slavia, Italy, Roumania and Czecho-Slovakia.The Communist Soldatenrate of Vienna, determined to strengthen propaganda in the barrapks, have appointed to this end a special committee of control, under the ex-leader of the Red Guard, Fritz Gruber. All men who are not Socialists, Communists or members of the Red Military Trades Unions- are to be driven out of the Wehrmacht. The Communist Wehrmen strictly enforce discipline, and, in contradiction to their previous tactics, avoid open propaganda in the barracks. These tactics accord with the endeavour of the Communist Party Headquarters to form well-trained Red Guards with strict proletarian discipline.Dr. Friedlaender is reported to be taking steps to organise the Austrian unemployed as far as possible. He has completed the organisation of. the building trade in Vienna, the only group in Austria suffering from serious unemployment. His method is to strengthen the Trade Unions, working Communists into the responsible posts.The arms depot discovered some time ago in the buildings of the Socialist and Communist Arbeiterrat is reported to have contained arms sufficient to equip a whole workmen&apos;s battalion.Miscellaneous.Bronski has been asked to obtain permission from the Government for the Russian Red Cross Mission to enter Austria.The Government conceded the demand of the railwaymen for 4,500 kronen to meet the increased cost of living, and the threatened strike was partial only. The extremists, however, demand a 50 per cent, rise in wages, a demand recognised as folly by the union leaders and the saner elements among the men. The influence of the young communistic elements is alarmingly powerful.The police are rather pleased than otherwise with the (general effect of Robert Williams&apos; recent visit to Vienna. Williams was formerly looked upon locally as a Communist, whereas his present Social Democratic opinions have a steadying influence. The &quot; Rote Fahne &quot; sourly described the meeting addressed by Williams as a show parade for the Amsterdam International, and satirised the orator and his supporters.CZECHO SLOVAKIA.The Communist Fusion.The Communist Party met in conference at Nusle towards the end of August, and received from Burian the orders of Moscow to centralise all Communist parties in the Republic. Dr. Smeral was evidently anxious to placate national sentiment, and insisted that a form of centralism was possible which would not mean passing over
executive power to the German Communists. Czech tactics had been correct, and must retain precedence. Smeral based his hopes of revolution on the culmination of the industrial crisis in Western Europe, but he did not minimise the difficulties with which official measures of repression confronted Czech Communism. Their front, he said, must be built up outside the organs of the State. It appears that a conference is to be held at the end of October, when the fusion required will take place and the programme of the united party will be elaborated. This fusion will, however, almost certainly be fictitious, and the independence of the two parties will subsist. The national feeling of Czechs and Germans alike is too acute to render possible a really united Communist party., In the mixed Czech and German districts of Moravia, a common Czecho-German Communist organisation is being formed. Kreibich is in Pressburg trying to fuse the German and Slovak parties. The Slovaks have refused to combine with the Czech Communists.Socialists and Communists at Strife.The breach between the Communists and the Socialist parties is widening steadily, and the only point of contact is found in the collection of relief funds for Russia. The Communists have been seeking to provoke strikes, particularly agricultural, but in most cases failure has resulted owing to the lack of support from the Socialist parties. Communist activities are directed largely to the capture of the Trades Unions. The workers in Slovakia have become very cool towards the Communist leaders. They have forced the Bolshevik leader, Deputy Svetlik, the organiser of strikes and bloodshed, to resign his seat, and will elect a Right Social Democrat in his place.The Communists and a General Strike.The Communists are said to be perfecting their plans for a general strike, working on the scheme prepared for a general strike last April. Special attention is to be given to the instructions of the Party Executives concerning the arming of the Communist members. The Czech section is well armed.The Communists may be helped by the considerable unrest caused in Slovakia by recent cuts in wages. There have been strikes in the iron mines and in some textile factories. Wood workers generally have accepted reductions of 15 to 20 per cent. In the building materials and chemical industries the cuts have been from 10 to 15 per cent. About 17 per cent, of the workmen in Slovakia are unemployed.The Communists can set to their credit the strike of the textile workers in the Reichenberg district and the hop-pickers in the Rakonitz district. A crisis appears to be imminent in the coal-mining industry. The miners have declared that they will accept no lessening of their standard of living, and they are ready to back words by deeds. The crisis can apparently be ended only by the nationalisation of the mines; it will in any case be exploited by the Communists to their own ends.Miscellaneous.The various Socialist parties and corporations have forced a Workmen&apos;s Help Committee for Russia.   The workers were asked
for a period of four weeks to give the wages of one hour&apos;s work weekly to the Russian Relief Fund.The 12th Zionist World Congress was held at Karlsbad during September. Five hundred and thirty delegates were present. The Congress appointed M. Sbkolow as President and Dr. Maotzkin as Vice-President. The congress was concerned mainly with the financing and the method of colonisation in Palestine and with the re-organisation of the governing bodies of the movement.   -Much of the Communist Propaganda carried on by the Soviet Government is said to have been controlled for some time by Bela Kun and Radek, Bela Run being charged with the work in the countries of the former Austrian Empire, and Radek with that carried on :in Poland, Germany and Roumania. Some time ago. Bela Kun is said to have provided the funds to organise a revolution in Czecho-Slovakia. .HUNGARY.Communist Intentions.Secret organisations in Hungary continue to work as hitherto. The propaganda centre in Pecs has been transferred to Szeged, the Hungarian Government having swept away all organisations in re-occupied territory of the Baranya. A Bolshevik organisation has, indeed, scant chance of survival once its existence is known to the Government. In Szeged the political situation is obscure. A pro-Eriedrich party and an organisation of Hungarian workmen appear to exist here, and the Communists, faithful to the instructions of Moscow, are trying to play off one against the other. Sadoul, who now has charge of West European propaganda centrals, meditates opening a new central in Budajpest or in Vienna preferably in Budapest. He has visions of another central in Hamburg. A number of agitators are going to Hungary in the near future.It is claimed in some quarters that all Communist action bearing &apos;on West Hungary has been directed from Austria, and that Schlesinger has acted in the main from the Austrian side of the frontier. The emigrant group of Hungarian Communists in Vienna has organised itself into a defensive and an offensive group. The leaders, Lieutenant Moscary and a certain Szekely, are in touch with the Hungarian Communists and run a courier service of their own. The threads combine in the editorial office of the Viennese flungarian Communist organ, &quot; Becsi Magyar Ujsag,&quot; in the hands of the leader Halmy.4. RUSSIA AND THE BORDER STATES. RUSSIA.The Famine.The position in regard to the famine &quot;and famine relief remains materially the same, though itmust be recognised that every week&apos;s delay in applying comprehensive measures of relief means the deepening of the tragedy, and the possibility of a worse disaster next year. On the only available figures regarding which it must not be forgotten that they come from interested quarters a population of between twenty and thirty millions is facing the greatest privations. Whatever may be done, some two or three millions will perish this winter.
The responsibility of the Soviet policy of requisitions for much of the present distress is shown in a report on the economic situation in Russia, which the Department of Commerce in Washington has prepared and in which it is stated that during this year in the Samara province, only 58 per cent, of last year&apos;s acreage was cultivated; in Kazan 95,000 acres, usually cultivated, were not sown at all; in Orel less than 50 per cent, of the arable land was sown, and in Tula only 20 to 35 per cent, of the necessary seed was available. The lessened requisitions of the Soviet reflect this situation.The difficulties in the way of relief are evidenced by reports that even when the new supplies of grain arrive from Western Europe, the peasants will not sow until they have sufficient in hand to keep them from starvation. As an instance, a few thousand poods of grain, sent to the Don and Saratov areas for seed purposes, have already been used for food. The emigration which is proceeding in some of the richer areas will also preclude the raising of winter wheat for next year, and the condition of the peasants themselves, and their lack of necessaries will tend to make the general situation bad next year. The bulk of the peasants are apathetic, and without faith in Soviet promises. Help will be required next year as well as this, and the character of the Russian peasant is such that he may come to rely on such support.The Soviet puts the total cost of helping famine victims at 38,587,150,000 roubles. It was announced towards the end of August that a number of governments were carrying out with honour their task of supplying the famine area with seeds, but in other governments the machinery of food supply was only just starting on its tasks. Reports on the work of the governments are to be published daily, and every government in reading- these reports will see beforehand its name either on the Red Roll or the Black Roll.The peasants in the districts not afflicted by the famine are said to be desperately resisting the efforts of the Soviet to requisition food. In the Smolensk district a punitive expedition was massacred, the peasants filling the mouths of the dead soldiers with rye and attaching labels &quot; tax paid &quot; to the bodies.In the face of calamity the appeals of the Third International have acquired a fresh urgency, but they have lost none of their insolence and calumny. The International admits that &quot; its entire foundations are being undermined from within by the black elementary forces of millions of starving people,&quot; and admits, too, that the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Western proletariat has abated.In a further appeal the International states that it has been obliged to renounce direct action until the Soviet Government has coped with its difficulties. The collapse of Russia is not concealed, and a note of alarm is sounded in the statement that &quot; the proletariat may lose the strong political bulwark it has at present in the Soviet Govern-ment.&quot; The renunciation of direct action only implies an armistice with the enemy, but the Third International will not &quot; yield another inch of its position.&quot;It is evident that these various calls for help are meeting with little practical response from the Western &quot; proletariat,&quot; which has its own acute difficulties to face, and may reasonably be asking what the Soviet is doing with the remains of its gold reserve. The Third International itself is still able, as evidence from many sources shows,
to find money for its propaganda abroad, which now seeks to exploits the question of famine relief for the purpose of inciting to revolution.The latest circular sent out by the International conveys the impression that the appeals hitherto issued have been largely intended as political propaganda, and that the urgent need now makes material help from foreign comrades more than ever desirable. The result of the collections hitherto is described as &quot;a drop in the sea.&quot; The various sections are told that &quot; Hilfsaktion &quot; is not a propaganda campaign, but an attempt to meet a terrible need. Various means of raising money are prescribed, including the allocation of a full day&apos;s wages on. November 7th, the anniversary of the revolution, for the victims of the famine. The adoption of places in the famine area is also counselled, as well as the collection of food. There are numerous complaints of lack of energy and diffusion of purpose, which must be remedied.The Soviet has now entered into three agreements with the joint Red Cross organisations one for voluntary relief, another for credit, and the third giving complete control of gifts, &amp;c, imported into Russia under the other two. There will be in Moscow a representative appointed by the Soviet and another appointed by Dr. Nansen, jointly holding full powers. If they do not agree, the scheme must break down. Dr. Nansen has put the total amount of credit required at about 30,000,000?., and has urgently appealed to the Governments to grant the credit of 10,000,000i. asked for by the Soviet, for private charity cannot meet the situation.The Soviet remains obdurate. It made no modification of its intransigent attitude towards the request of the Inter-Allied Com-mission in Paris for permission to send a committee of enquiry into Russia. This request was bluntly refused by Tchitcherin, in an insolent note which described the Commission^ proposals as &quot; a monstrous gesture of mockery.&quot; But the Soviet did not offer and has not offered any specific guarantees that relief shall go to the victims of the famine and not be diverted to maintain its own Praetorian Guard.It is in fact reported that the Soviet has ordered that foodstuffs and articles of primary necessity shall be supplied first to the Red Army and the Fleet, and secondly to workmen and employees of the State. This seems to dispose of Dr. Nansen&apos;s contention that if the Soviet Government has the distribution of famine relief it will not go to the Red Army.The International Commission, was not, however, dissolved in consequence of Tchitcherin&apos;s note, to which it agreed not to reply. It decided instead to convene a European Conference of 24 states, including Germany and Bulgaria, at Brussels on October 6th. There is no intention on the part of the British or the other Allied Govern-ments to depart from their resolution that adequate guarantees must be given by the Soviet and that a commission of enquiry must investi-gate transport and means of distribution. Tchitcherin meanwhile followed up his first note by another couched in milder language, but reiterating the soviet&apos;s refusal to allow a commission of enquiry to enter Russia.This attitude has produced its natural reactions. At the end of September the League of Nations rejected, the principal proposals put forward by Dr. Nansen, and refused to sanction the agreements
hastily signed in Moscow. Mr. Fisher, for the British Government, doubted the possibility of such agreements retaining their full legal force, and stated that present economic difficulties precluded the possibility of giving credit for the relief of famine abroad. To discuss the offer of the Bolsheviks to give such credits priority before all other debts would be superfluous. Dr. Nansen&apos;s apjDointment as High, Commissioner of the League was also not approved.The Brussels Conference itself reiterated previous decisions that Government aid must be preceded by enquiry, and that a condition of Government credits is the recognition by Russia of existing debts and other obligations.The liquidation of the Non-Party Famine Committee is universally regarded as a direct result of the activity of the Left Wing of the Communist Party, which, in conjunction with the Extraordinary Commission, had been intriguing against the Committee from the moment of its inception. The Left Wing suspiectcd. that the mere existence of the Committee affected Communist prestige and that it would be used to cloak counter-revolutionary activities. The opposition, at first led by Radek, Bukharin and Dzerjinsky, was strengthened by the adhesion of Trotsky, and the Committee was ruthlessly swept away when it had served its purpose of covering the Government&apos;s famine measures with an appearance of democracy, and establishing a little closer contact between Moscow and foreign states. Lenin gave the order of dissolution and was strong enough to order the arrest of some of Bukharin&apos;s followers, on account of their opposition to the Governments economic policy. His action was determined by the necessity of upholding party principles, which were violated by the existence of the Committee. It need not be regarded as a surrender to the Extremists, but as a concession to maintain party unity. It should be noted that almost simultaneously with the founding of the Committee a &quot; Left &quot; Committee was formed for assisting the hunger-stricken districts.The Foreign Relations of the Soviet.The anxiety of the Soviet to distract attention from the ruin at home by false stories of perils from abroad lias been shown during the last month by the allegations of Moscow that France had ordered Poland and Roumania to present Russia with ultimatums, and that both Governments had rejected the French demand. These charges were promptly denied in Paris, the Quai d&apos;Orsai stating that the attempt to spread the idea that France would consider exploiting Russia&apos;s present difficulties was particularly odious.Lord Curzon&apos;s Note of September 7th, 1921, regarding breaches of the Trade Agreement with Soviet Russia has created consternation in the councils of the Soviet Government, divers of whose agents in foreign countries have been ordered to give explanations regarding the leakage of information from Soviet offices, which the mention in Lord Curzon&apos;s Note of secret documents signed by Nuorteva, Stalin, Eliava, and others proves. On September 21st&apos;, the Moscow Foreign Office sent a secret circular to the Soviet representatives in the United Kingdom, Germany and the Central European States, attributing the leakage to traitorous elements which have found their way into the Soviet Delegations. &quot; .
A summary of the Soviet reply to the Note was forwarded by Mr. Hodgson from Moscow on September 30th, and the full text, dated September 27th and signed by Litvinoff in his capacity of, Soviet Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, was later handed to tho British Government by Mr. Bersin. It was a foregone conclusion that the Soviet reply would consist largely of denials and declarations that the documentary evidence adduced in Lord Curzon&apos;s Note was worthless and based upon forged documents. The Soviet Note affirms that these documents were obtained from the Confidential Propaganda publication entitled &quot; Ost Information,&quot; issued periodically under the joint auspices of the German Foreign Office Political Intelligence Department and the German Special Police. This assertion on the part of the Soviet Authorities is a mere leap in the dark and a substitution for the unknown of the conceivably possible. The authenticity of the documents adduced in Lord Curzon&apos;s Note is irrefutable and they are selected from a mass of documents, all equally authentic and so considerable in bulk that no secret service in the world would be in a position to repay a gang of forgers the price of their labour in forging; while, regarding the matter from its other aspect, no gang of forgers could produce, so many documents and get people to pay enough for them. Only the indefatigable industry of Soviet bureaucracy could be so abundantly productive. The reference and nature of the documents is too wide for fabrication, they bear the internal&apos;stamp of truth, while the external evidence of their authenticity has borne the test of searching criticism.One of the principal falsehoods in LitvinofTs Note is sufficiently disposed of in the second article of Part II. of this issue on pages 54-59 where Litvinoffs statement that the Moscow Authorities have had no dealings, direct or indirect, with Indian revolutionaries is definitely proved false by four letters from Mahendra Nath Roy, the notorious Indian revolutionary, and his wife, written in August from Moscow to Paris. The originals of these letters have been examined and photographed in LondonParticular points in the Note include the denial that Nuorteva was, as stated in one of the documents cited, President of the Collegium of the Western Section of the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on August 1st, and Litvinoff points out that Nuorteva had been in prison since March. This was known. Nuorteva was arrested in March for misappropriation of funds. As non-political offences, however, peccadilloes of this nature and prevalence are, in Moscow, leniently regarded. Indications soon arrived that Nuorteva was at large. In June he was permitted to attend the Third Congress of the Third International and there is reason to believe that he was permitted, under a system of open arrest, to transact official business. Imprisonment for civil offences in Soviet Russia is not a matter of that severity to which countries living in the darkness of capitalism are accustomed. Individuals technically on the prison roll are often permitted to live at home and perform their official duties, their difference from the &quot;free&quot; citizens among whom they move being principally that they are even more liable than others to be incarcerated at the whim of the local authorities;
Other assertions in Litvinoffs Note have the misfortune to run counter to known declarations of the Moscow wireless, printed as&apos; official in the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; the &quot; Rote Fahne,&quot; &quot; L&apos;Humanite &quot; and other organs friendly to Moscow in foreign countries.In reading the denials the extreme tenuity of the grounds on which they are made must not be forgotten. In March Mr. Krassin officially denied that there was any such person as &quot; Beresin,&quot; then stated on perfectly good authority to be the signatory to certain instructions regarding propaganda sent by the Third International to Kudish, the head of the Soviet Delegation in Constantinople. But &quot; Beresin &quot; is now amongst us in the flesh, and is M. Bersin, Krassin?s own second-in-command on the Russian Trade Delegation in Moorgate Street. The transposition of an &apos; e &quot; sufficed for M. Krassin. M. Litvinoff&apos;s sense of truth to the letter is no less delicate.The Soviet meanwhile continues to accuse both Roumania and Poland of aggressive intentions and of carrying on campaigns against Russia and the Ukraine. It is alleged that from Poland and Roumania Petlyurian bands are crossing the frontier and trying to hamper the levy of the food tax and the collection of corn for the famished.- - .        .Indications 01 Future Policy.There are some indications that the Soviet has decided to check the embarrassing zeal of its agents in the East. Thus, it has been definitely decided that no Congress of Eastern peoples shall be held this year. The Third International were obliged to concur in this decision, but they succeeded in carrying a reservation that an Eastern Congress might be convened if, in exceptional circumstances, special sanction were given by the Soviet of People&apos;s Commissaries and the Third International. The famine intervened to prevent an intended special meeting of the Council of Action and Propaganda, and the Council was obliged to curtail radically its expenditure on propaganda,. in view of the desperate need of fighting the famine. Propaganda in the East, however, is not likely to be altogether abandoned, since it is hoped to obtain from various Indian revolutionary associations considerable financial help for work in Turkestan and Turkey. The Council of Action and Propaganda is setting up a Turkish branch in Batum, but it has been warned by the Third International to exercise great discretion in its activities in Anatolia.Lenin&apos;s Miscalculations.A capable observer points out that Lenin foresaw that Communist economics would head direct to catastrophe and that the critical situation of &apos; world industry would incline capitalist governments to commercial agreements with Russia. The only means of payment were concessions, and here Lenin mistimed the favourable moment, as he had already mistimed the world revolution and even the German revolution. Up to the present Lenin has been victorious over the opponents of his schemes. He has even, as has already been mentioned, succeeded in establishing a &quot; Unique Tribunal&quot; against the Tcheka and the attempts of its leader Dzerjinsky, who is at present officially replaced by Unschlicht. It is not known how the Tcheka has accepted this blow and what its counter action will be. As regards the people, political self-consciousness is returning, and an energetic - work for the union of all proletarians who do not share Bolshevik views is going on.   The Intelligentsia is slowly reviving,   Peasant hostility towards
the towns persists. The re-awakening of the people may not turn into open revolt against the Government, but it will probably take the shape of a slow revolution, whioh Lenin will seek to direct. But all depends upon the famine, and its effect upon the psychology of the people.The Economic Counter-Revolution.The financial departments of the Soviet are seeking to re-establish the destroyed tax organisation. Their new policy also recommends the restoration of payment for articles handed over by the Govern-ment and the restoration of inter-province accounts. All limitations to the amount of funds held by private persons or organisations are cancelled; the confiscation otherwise than by legal power, of sums paid to the Commissariat of Finance or to the co-operative organisations is forbidden; the withdrawal is allowed on demand of cash paid in, and the secrecy of financial transactions is provided for. Other regulations order that all agricultural machinery, cattle, &amp;c, distri-buted by State Departments, must be paid for in cash unconditionally. Payment for foodstuffs may be made on labour cards. All articles sold for cash in the markets are to be assessed at fixed prices.The Soviet has also published the main principles on which the new tariff system is based. Remuneration is calculated according to the cost of living, but it is added that wages must depend on the output of the workman. Foodstuffs are to be issued not in accordance with the number of workmen employed in the industry, but in accordance with the output of the industry.In explanation of the failure of the State exchange of goods, &quot; Pravda &quot; states that the prices fixed by the People&apos;s Commissariat for Food Supply, in conjunction with the Central Co-operative Union, were twice as high as those demanded by the profiteer in the open market. Another fault of the co-operatives was their inability to utilise the &quot; season &quot; for certain goods. Thus, sickles and scythes were supplied to the co-operatives in June, but the poorer peasants, who had no grain to offer, were unable to buy them. It would have been more profitable to distribute the goods, on condition that they were paid for in the autumn.The Red Army.The consuming anxiety of the Soviet is shown by the recent decision of the Central Executive to speed up the military training of all Communists, to hold special Communist troops ready to meet all possible contingencies, and to register ail persons up to the age of 65, with the object of tracing counter-revolutionary activities.Trotsky has been heartening the Moscow Soviet with stories of the fighting eagerness of the Red Army. Against this may be set a report that 15 members of the Red General Staff have been arrested, including the head of the Organisation Department of the Staff and his two adjutants. The Soviet has ordered its agents abroad to remain unconditionally at then posts. If they abandon their posts and refuse to return to Russia their relatives at home will be subjected to reprisals.The reorganised Russian General Staff Academy, rechristened the &quot; Military Academy of the Workers&apos; and Peasants&apos; Red Army,&quot; has sent out its first batch of Red Staff officers.The Soviet appears to have been running for some time past military political courses designed to prepare workers for political -O  16156 d
educational work in the Red Army, chiefly among the native units, and among the working class and peasant population of the East. The courses extend over two months and the numerical strength of the students is 600 men.Communist Activities.Tho liaison between the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and the&apos; Western European Secretariat of the Third International is reported to be at present -very badly organised. The Secretariat supplies the Commissariat with information, and receives information from it in return, and the Commissariat directs the general lines of work of the Secretariat. It has already been mentioned that the representatives of the Secretariat abroad, elsewhere than in Berlin,are fully independent of the official Soviet Missions, the delegates of which have acquired discretion, and do not commit themselves directly to illegal actions in the countries to which they are accredited. Dirty work of that-kind is left to the Secretariat. An unconfirmed report states that the new centre of activity is at Worms.Mostovenko is said to have been instructed by Moscow to take over the direction of Bolshevik propaganda in Central Europe, in the Balkans, and probably in Italy. He is to work in detail for the attachment of Austria to Germany, to do everything to prevent the entry of Poland into the Little Entente, to obtain the signature Of a commercial treaty between Czecho-Slovakia and Soviet Russia, and to develop and direct a Communist movement in Upper Silesia.It is stated that the Congress of the Red Trade Union International was a failure from the point of view of the Russian Communists. The Syndicalists did not formally break away, but they remained in opposition throughout the Congress. The Russians managed to secure the election of their nominees to the Bureau of the Trades Union International, and these are now developing a policy which will make the Bureau completely dependent on the Central Executive Committee of the Third international. A split, which has in fact already shown itself, may be anticipated between the pro-Moscow and anti-Moscow sections of the Unions affiliated to the International. The Executive of the Third International has delegated Bukharin, Souvarine and Reckert to the Red Trade Union International. The Red Trade Union International, on its side, has delegated Losovski, Tom Mann and Nains to the Executive of the Third International.The Red Trade Union International has. informed its English disciples that in all questions affecting administration, &amp;c., they are to communicate with Arossiew or Arossjew, appointed in place of Rosovsky.The Executive Committee of the Communist Youth is now subordi-natedto that of the Communist International.A report upon the Second Congress of the Young Communist International states tha,t the principal decision of the Congress was that all its power should be exerted upon the peasant class. The organisation is to be developed in those countries where it is weak, notably in England and. America.The Third.International lias decided to issue a paper twice a week in English, German and French, called &quot; International Correspondence for the Press/&apos; It was announced at the beginning of September that a &quot; Weekly Review of the Communist Internationale &quot; would be published in connection with &quot;Pravda,&apos;&apos;
The Third International is reported to have a fund of about one million carats in diamonds deposited at the Soviet State Bank. It also possesses a number of valuable pictures and much silver plate.Internal Troubles. !The Soviet continues to issue orders, which in most cases cannot be obeyed, for the combating of banditism?&apos; It is said that banditism in the south is so widespread that unless famine relief trains are guarded by foreign troops there will be no chance of the food ever reaching its destination.Makhno has fled to Roumanian territory. The Soviet has demanded that he shall be handed over, but this request is not likely to be complied with at an early date. Antonoff has reappeared in the Tamboff Government, disguised as an agent of the Tcheka, by which means he persuaded the local Commissars to provide him with a quantity of ammunition and equipment.Moscow reports that in the Novo-Uzensk district of the Saratoff government, bandits have destroyed three quarters of the Soviet farms. The raiding of farms in other areas is also reported. iThe Moscow wireless has been circulating various indignant reports concerning the wrecking in the Ukraine of a train loaded with food for the miners of the Donetz Basin. This crime is set down to the White Guards of SavinkofE and Petlyura, but it would appear to be due to Green Bands which the Soviet cannot repress.The Financial Chaos.The deficit in the budget has increased from 18 milliard roubles in 1918 to one thousand milliard roubles in 1920. This does not include the losses on various nationalised enterprises. It may be taken that the deficit is equivalent to 90 per cent, of the budget.The amount of paper money in circulation has. risen from 1.8,000,000,000 roubles in 1916 to 955.000,000,000 in 1920,andthe output of paper for 1921 is known already to exceed that for 1920. The unofficial rate of exchange in Moscow is at present.. 260,000. roubles to the   sterling. .... .     .,.       *The Petrograd mint is collecting silver, in view of the proposed resumption of minting silver coinage. Great difficulty is found in securing experienced workers. .Trade Projects.Interviewed in Moscow before his departure for London, Krassin mentioned that negotiations were being carried on in the match, paper and celluloid industries, also in connection -with the Russo-Asiatic Consolidated Company. Mr. Leslie Urquhart has since announced the failure of his negotiations with the Soviet; Krassin stated that, in view of the blockade by well-known European capitalist groups, the question of realising naphtha abroad must be settled by direct negotiations with European purchasers through the , heads of the capitalist bands. By this means the last attempts at a blockade would be frustrated. Krassin appeared to be doubtful of the success of an international loan, but affirmed that the final victory was on the side of Russia. He is, however, reported to have stated that the Soviet is not far from floating a large money loan in France,&apos; &apos;: who will thus be able to atone for all the mistakes she has made in herP a
attitude, towards Soviet Russia.&quot; He dealt at length with the nego-tiations which the Soviet is conducting with the Hamburg-Amerika shipping lines, and also declared that the Soviet had just concluded arrangements for the letting on lease to several Swedish financial groups of certain industrial concerns such as the Northern Telephone Company, the Dubrovka paper mills, and a number of match factories.A formal agreement has been concluded between the Soviet and the Great Northern Telegraph Company under which the Company receives a concession for operating the telegraph service with the Far East via Russia.Lomonosoff has stated that all orders for railway material, excluding engines, but including the permanent way, have been placed with Hugo Stinnes,, who has agreed to undercut all other tenders by 15 per cent. .It is reported that a company formed by Swedish, Norwegian and American banking concerns, in which British firms may also participate, is taking up a concession for building a Great Northern Railway, to run from Murmansk to Tobolsk via Kotlas, and to join up with the Siberian Railway. The Company have the right to exploit the forest for five versts on either side of the line during a period of 25 years, at the end of which time the railway reverts to the State, and a scheme of compensation will be prepared. Ganetsky, a Swedish banker, and Weber, formerly a member of the Russian Cadet party, are the moving spirits in this scheme.The Position of M. Krassin.Kr&quot;.ssin?s view of the present situation in Russia is said to envisage the approaching overthrow of the Extremists; he is also convinced that Lenin and Trotsky fully realise their mistakes, but can find no issue from the labyrinth. Krassin&apos;s position in Soviet circles is strong but he has serious difficulties; with Djerjinsky and the special police, who quite&apos; recently went so far as to search his offices in his absence. Two of Krassin&apos;s closest friends perished in the recent massacre at Petrograd, which took place without Lenin&apos;s knowledge and consent. The enmity between Krassin and Lomonosoff also persists. The extremists who work against Krassin empowered Lomonosoff, who is Djerjinsky&apos;s assistant, to place orders in Germany without the consent of Krassin. The result has been that Lomonosoff gave orders in Germany, chiefly for locomotives and railroad materials, for a sum of 163,000,000 dollars, at an average price of 10 per cent, to 20 per cent, higher than the British prices. Krassin was not able to conclude the arrangement with Armstrongs. for the repair of locomotives without the consent of Lomonosoff, who, in order to undermine the position of Krassin in Moscow, and especially in England, arranged a contract which it is quite impossible to fulfil.Miscellaneous.The punishments for thefts of goods in transit now include the death penalty.Moscow announces that an All-Russian Relief Week will be held during the period between September-15th and October 15th.The granting of visas to foreigners for entry to Russia without preliminary sanction from Moscow has now been strictly prohibited,
It is learnt that all the foreigners who frequent the Bolshevik Academy in Moscow pass under Russian false names, so as to escape persecution when they return home.The Seamen&apos;s Conference, which was held in Moscow during August, issued a manifesto to the dock labourers of Bombay, and decided to get into direct touch with the Indian dock labourers in order to assist them in a combined organisation with the Indian seamen.The Kieff Government Extraordinary Commission has tried the members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Committee, nine of whom have been sentenced to death. They were charged with attempting to establish a Ukrainian People&apos;s Republic against the will of the workmen and peasants.The discussions of representatives of the Russian Metal Workers&apos; Union with the delegates of the metal workers&apos; organisations of West Europe resulted in the formation of an International Propaganda Bureau of the Revolutionary Metal Workers and the elction of an International Committee including Russian, German, Czecho-Slovakian, British, American, French and Scandinavian metal workers.Moscow is said to be at present engaged in schemes for the forma-tion of an international federation of post, telegraph and telephone officials and workers, an International of textile workers and an Inter-national of workers engaged in the building trade. These new federa-tions will be autonomous and will obey Moscow only in common affairs of the world revolution and revolutionary strategy and policy.There is information that the Soviet is taking all precautions to place money and valuables in security abroad. Thus, the assets of the State Treasury, in notes, bullion, and jewels are being secretly removed from the country. These negotiations are said to take place through the intermediary of the well-known Swedish banker, Olaf Aschberg, who has been in Moscow and who has been appointed secret financial agent for the Soviet on the recommendation of Krassin. Aschberg was given charge of 50,000 kilograms of gold and of considerable quan-tities of notes, which have gone for sale to Stockholm, ita Reval and Riga.   Aschberg himself is reported to be now in Berlin.FINLAND.The Communists are finding the workmen very intractable. Very few of them are communistically inclined, and they are convinced that no good can come of Russian methods. The anti-Communist propaganda carried on by Finns who have returned from Russia is very persuasive, especially in the provinces. Some of.it is spontaneous, but in general it has been arranged by the political police. The discontent with present difficulties of living and with the Government, ought not, however, to be underrated. The hopes that the new Government would improve the conditions of the workers have not been fulfilled.A number of French and German comrades arrived in Helsingfors for the Communist demonstration which was ordered by the Third International on September 4th. As far as Helsingfors was concerned the demonstration resulted in a little effervescence only. The Government was wise in time, and took comprehensive measures. Round about Helsingfors on September 3rd there were various meetings and some shooting. There is talk of better organised demonstrations in about two months&apos; time.
The, s.s. &quot; Subbotnik,&quot; a steamer sent by the Ostsee Speditions Gesellschaft to Petrograd, was searched at Viborg and a quantity of propaganda literature, explosive material and money was confiscated. All these had been sent from Dr. Gylling to the Viborg Communist leader, Alarik Louhi. Louhi has been arrested and a search made&apos; of his quarters. Here, besides a considerable sum of money, were found many papers relating to a terrorist campaign in Finland, together with a list of persons who were to be attacked.Baltic States. ESTHONIA.Bolshevik espionage and propaganda work have been of little consequence since the departure of Litvinoff. Gobermann, a colourless IDersonality, is now charged with propaganda, which is being cautiously conducted. The,Hotel Petrograd is chiefly a transit point for litera-ture, funds and agents. Here two Famine Relief Committees are operating, one of them official, soliciting help from the general public; the other non-official, for Communists only. Employees of the delegation have sacrificed 20 per cent, of their salaries for famine relief. .- The Esthonian Communist Party is/ reported to consist of 19,000 members, and to be subsidised by funds from Russia, through the Soviet Trade Delegation. A Central Commission in Russia, divided into moderate and extremist groups, controls it. Official measures of repression have considerably curbed Communist activities, but the organisation remains, and has members on town councils and in all the larger factories. The checking and combing out of the Reval Communist Party, ordered by Moscow in connection with the similar process which is being carried out in Russia, has been completed; 1,000 members are said to have been dismissed from the germ cell out of a total of 3,750. All persons who served in, or had any connection with the late North-Western Army, have been dismissed from any employment they had in connection with the Petrograd Hotel.LATVIA.It is reported that the Intelligence Services of the Baltic States have arranged to exchange information. The authorities concerned are unanimous that Bolshevik propaganda and activities have considerably diminished.The Latvian Foreign Minister has asked Tchitcherin for a reply to an earlier Note presented by Esthonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which pointed out that the Soviet authorities were not carrying out their Peace Treaty obligations.Latvia is said to be systematically returning to Russia, not even permitting them to cross the border, thousands of Jewish Lettish refugees, even though they may possess all necessary documents.The local branches of the Communist Party in Latvia and the Border States generally have been advised that they are not energetic enough in keeping down expenditure. In extreme cases, an extra-ordinary subtraction is to be made from daily pay, sufficient, if possible, to cover the expenses of tho organisation.
LITHUANIA.The Government has been asked to permit the entry into Lithuania of the family of Radek, some relatives of Lunacharsky. and the family of yet another prominent Commissar, whose name has not yet been divulged.The examination of. the arrested members of the Lithuanian Central Executive Communist Committee has established that the Bolshevik organisation had departments in all the towns and larger villages of Lithuania. It jjossessed a special 23assj)ort department, which supplied Communists with forged documents, and printed various periodicals, dealing chiefly in propaganda against the Lithuania Army. The agitators arrested admitted that Moscow is. depressed at the position in the Baltic States owing to the anti-Bolshevik keenness of the authorities. Esthonia is regarded most hopefully. The chief attention of the Third International is devoted to Germany.POLAND.Labour Difficulties.The strikes of the Warsaw municipal employees and the greater jDart of the railway troubles were settled at the end of August. The speakers behaved on the whole very peaceably, and were even in pleasant relations with the members of the Polish Self-Help services, who worked the tram and other services in Warsaw. Many of the Self-Help workers sympathised with the demands of the workers for increased pay. It is difficult to see how the economic situation can be materially improved while the mark remains collapsed. The peasants are the only people with food, and the food supply of Warsaw is practically controlled by a few middlemen, who rig the market shamelessly. The Railwaymen&apos;s Union have meanwhile urged the Government to evolve a genuine economic policy. They point out that to grant an increase of 30 per cent, in wages to railwaymen and at the same time to increase the price of sugar 275 per cent, and coal 126 per cent, is only creating a vicious circle.There are reports that a coup is being planned to overthrow the Danzig Senate and to organise in its place a dictatorship of workmen. About 3,000 workmen in Zoppot have been armed and are ready to fight. The leaders wish a general strike to precede the coup. Rau, who is in direct touch with Moscow, is said to be the leader.5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES. GREECE.The Government is credited with the intention of bringing in a new Land Expropriation Bdl, to which it expects considerable oppo-sition from the landowners. The Macedonian Greeks are against the Governments expropriation policy, and the Mohammedan elements have protested against the planting of Greek refugees in Turkish villages.The monthly paper &quot; Hellas,&quot; published in Hamburg, is the chief organ of German propaganda in Greece. It is edited by a certain Ziebarth, professor of Ancient History at Marburg, who has recently
formed a Greco-German League. Other moving spirits of German propaganda in Greece are Chronopoulos, Greek Consul-General at Hamburg; Tsakas, a nouveau riohf: : and a certain Pantasopoulos.JUGO-SLAVIA.Four Communist members of the Jugo-Slav Parliament have been arrested in Vienna, at the demand of the Belgrade Government. Two of them, Pavlovitch and Cekitch, were returning from the &apos;Congress of the Third International, the others, Jovanovitch and Lemej, were fugitives from Jugo-Slavia.The new law for the security of the State has already been mentioned in the Review. Its provisions are Draconian. Thus, sentence of death is 23ossible for &quot; the writing, publishing and distri-bution,&quot; &amp;c, of literature intended to arouse hatred against the State, and for the organising, support and membership of an organisation with those aims. The law even provides for the destruction of whole villages and the extermination of the distant relatives of accused persons in order to destroy the seed of Communism. Imprisonment or fines to the extent of 50,000 dinar or both may be inflicted on persons wearing or carrying badges, flags or inscriptions which call for protest against the Government or which influence public opinion against the present system.BULGARIA. The Prospects 01 Communism.The violent elements of Communism in Bulgaria are reported to be to a great extent neutralised by the slow caution of Bulgarian mentality. Town and country stand in opposition to each other. The Communist may be taken as the natural representative of the town spirit, and the imposition on the towns of narrow and intolerant peasant rule will hardly tend towards the municipal and industrial progress of which Bulgaria stands in urgent need. The so-called &quot; bourgeois &quot; parties are for the moment impotent and discredited, so that the Communist Party, apart from a few extreme fanatics, would probably be preferable to the agrarians, only so far as municipal representation is concerned. It is possible that in Bulgaria, a country without an aristocracy and with slight class divisions, occupational enmity between peasant and town dweller is a greater obstacle to social progress than class war.A pointed illustration of these difficulties has been provided by the agrarian rule which has followed the forcible dissolution by the Government of the municipal councils at Roustchuk, Varna and Bourgas. The Communist Council at Bourgas, though it taxed the propertied classes heavily, considerably improved the amenities of the port and the transaction of official business, and eliminated to a great extent corrupt practices from the conduct of affairs. The new prefect is said to be an example of agrarian rule &quot; incapable, illite-rate and corrupt &quot; The merchant classes generally regard the appoint-ment of ignorant peasants to control Bourgas as a greater danger than the continuance in power of men who were intelligent and honest if politically fanatics.
The Communists and Revolution.The Communists have given October 24th as tho probable date for a revolutionary upheaval in Bulgaria. The Government of the country is to be seized, if possible by peaceful methods, backed by a show of armed force. Should this scheme fail, revolution will be begun on the lines, not of the Russian, but of the French Revolution. Moscow is directing these schemes through numerous Russians who have been sent to Bulgaria. The strong national spirit which still exists in the country is likely, however, to militate against any revolutionary upheaval. The Communist rank and&quot; file does not want revolution, but the means of gaining a decent livelihood. There also exist numerous cross currents caused by other political movements. The Communist military organisation, which is officered by Bulgarians, is said to be strong and to have very large quantities of arms and ammunition.Kemalist Plots.The Kemalist organisation in Bulgaria is reported to have made secret plans for the carrying out of raids on Thrace in order to prevent the departure of Greek reinforcements to Asia Minor. These raids will be carried out by comitadjis composed purely of Turks, and are contingent upon a successful Nationalist counter-attack in Asia Minor. These are said to have been provisionally fixed for the 24th October, thus coinciding with the opening of Communist activities. By that date the demobilisation of the Bulgarian Army is expected to be complete. It is to be noted that in many cases the demobilised soldiers pass from the Army to the Communist military organisation. The Kemalists themselves are showing a growing fear of the Communists.ROUMANIA.According to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; the imprisoned Communist leaders have been shot after having been encouraged by agents-provocateurs to attempt an escape from prison. Among the dead is Popovici, general secretary of the Roumanian Trade Union Executive.6. NEAR EASTERN STATES. TURKEY.Anatolia and the Bolsheviks.There is no modification of the unfriendly and suspicious attitude of the Anatolian population towards the Bolsheviks. Bolshevik aid has been coming in, mainly in gun and small arms ammunition and rifles. The Bolsheviks, at the request of Angora, have again changed their counsul at Trebizond, a Jew named Krossin succeeding Bigarov, notorious as the murderer of Count Mirbach in Moscow in 1918. The Nationalists pursue their policy of multiplying obstacles in the way of the Soviet workers, seeking to gain much and give little. So closely watched are the Soviet representatives at Angora that it is almost impossible for them to establish effective touch with the Turkish Communists.The Kemalists and Enver Pasha.Enver Pasha is. stated to have recently gone to Tashkent, It is said that a conference was arranged to take place early in September
at Kars at the instigation of the Angora Government. The Russian Soviet and the Governments of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan were to send representatives, and an understanding was anticipated whereby the Turkish Eastern Army would be free for employment against the Greeks. Other reports indicate that a northerly move-ment of. Russian troops from the Transcaucasus was beginning.It has also been established that a military, mission composed of four officers belonging to the Nationalist Eastern Army has been set up in Baku under the presidency of Chobanoglou Zeki Bey, with the object of watching Enver&apos;s activities, undermining his influence in Azerbaijan and preventing his establishing his influence with the Persian Revolutionary Party.Colonel Kiazim Bey, Chief of Staff on the Eastern front, and his brother-in-law, Nuri Pasha, were recalled to Angora, ostensibly in order to fill other appointments, in reality on account of their Enverist sympathies.Plots and Plans of Angora and Constantinople.The Bolshevik envoy in Angora is said to have of late frequently requested explanations with regard to Nationalist activities in the for-mation of an Islamic Federation in the Caucasus. He has intimated that these activities may precipitate very grave results.The existence of a plot organised and subsidised from Angora, chiefly among Turkish officers, with a view to stirring up revolution at Constantinople, causing disaffection among Indian troops and assassinating leading officers of the Allied Forces, was discovered by the British intelligence authorities during September. The British Commander-in-Chief submitted a list of names of compromised persons to the Turkish authorities, asking for the handing over of the men concerned within seven days, when the cases would be tried by an Allied Court of Enquiry.^the secret agreement recently negotiated between the French and tlie^CfovCTnment at Oonafcantiuupfe has encountered difficulties, and a. vote regarding it in the Turkish Cabinet was followed by the resignation of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Finance, Justice and National Defence. The proposed agreement was directed, on the one hand, against Great Britain in Mesopotamia, and, on the other, against Soviet Russia in the Republics of the Caucasus. In Mesopo-tamia the Turks were to make trouble: in the Caucasus they were to support former Governments of the over-run Caucasian Republics, while seeking for a pretext to denounce their Treaty with Soviet Russia. With this part of the policy the Kemalists disagree, and their Assembly has granted an amnesty to Turkish Communists.The Beikos Committee Reviving.The Beikos Committee, though still somewhat demoralised, is recovering from its recent terrors and is looking forward to the arrival of Vodovosoff, who has been given wide powers enabling him to revise the work of the Constantinople centres and to co-ordinate future work on a definite plan. Co-operation with the local Turkish Communists appears to be desired. With a view to common action, a member of the Beikos Committee is to get in touch with the new Terrorist-Com-munist group which has lately been established in Constantinople, but which, wanting a leader and lacking contact with existing Bol-shevik. organisations, has hitherto done little to justify itself.
Meanwhile,, documents which have lately been obtained securely establish the connection of the Beikos Communist Party with the Third International. Moscow appears to be satisfied with the Beikos organisation and to be willing to leave the organisation of the local work to the discretion of the members. - Exhaustive information con-cerning the political and military situation, is, however, insisted upon.A general meeting will shortly be held at which a new Executive Committee will be chosen and the future of the organisation discussed. Moscow has declared its conviction that the betrayal of the Communists of the Constantinople region was caused by the activities of the Allied and Wrangel counter-espionage organisations. Information regarding the possibility of a rising in favour of the Kemalists has been asked for. The necessary measures have been taken for the grant of a subsidy from the representative of the Russian Soviet in Angora.EGYPT.Bolshevik Schemes.Bolshevik agitation in Egypt is said now to be led by Moslem and Pan-Islamic elements, and both pro-Turkish propaganda and sympathy with the Turkish cause have notably increased.&apos; It may reasonably be inferred that the advanced post of Bolshevism ; is established in Palestine, which is favourable ground for commencing operations against Egypt. The Kemalist-Pan-Islamic-cum-Bolshevik liaison between Angora and Arabia now seems to be completely-established. There are grounds for believing that the Bolsheviks are trying to coquet with the Egyptian extremists. The extremists, the Labour syndicates-cates, the Turkish and Pan-Islamic elements,.. the Bolshevik agents reported to be converging on&apos;the&apos;country;&apos;and the Third International as a centre in Alexandria, are elements which favour Bolshevism in its anti-British designs in the East.Communism: Miscellaneous.The notorious Joseph Rosenthal, whose connection with Bolshevik agitation in Egypt has more than Once been noticed, has stated that he has been appointed Russian Soviet agent in Egypt and all passports to enter Soviet Russia must be vised by him.The activities of the Alexandria club known as &quot; Group d&apos;Etudes Sociales&quot; have already been mentioned. The members are now meeting twice weekly and are conducting an active Communist pro-paganda. li.&quot;Writing to Lismer, of the Provisional Council of Trade Unions, Manchester, one P. C. Barton, of Glasgow says that he would like to see the Red International lending effective aid to the Trade Unions in Egypt. Protest against the decrees forbidding the combination Of workers could restore &quot; a sadly shaken faith in the British worker by the Egyptian.&quot; &quot;iZaghloul and his British Friends.Zaghloul&apos;s new tactics are said to be towards peace with Adly Pasha, if an alliance is possible without unduly compromising Zaghloul&apos;s position. Zaghloul has gone so far as to say that he is willing to support Adly if the latter secures an acceptable agreement. He has allowed it to be known that he is willing to accept an invitation to
join in the negotiations. Signs are not wanting that Zaghloul&apos;s popularity is waning.The delegation of Labour members of the British House of Commons reached Alexandria during September and was received by delegates of various Zaghloulist organisations; a notable exception was the Labour Federation.A meeting at which Bernard Shaw presided was held in London before the departure of the Delegation. Shaw advised the Egyptian students present to set up an organisation on Sinn Fein lines, beginning with Courts of Law. This advice is said to have been accepted with enthusiasm. Zaghloul himself seems soon to have tired of playing the host, and for what are described as &quot; private reasons &quot; cancelled his further tours with the Labour Mission, which left for England on October 7th instead of October 12th. Zaghloul&apos;s exclusion of the British Press from the banquet he gave to the Labour members gave rise to caustic comments on the part of the local British Press.SYRIA.According to the Homel Propaganda Bureau the Russian Soviet Government has been informed from Egypt that the Authorities in Palestine are taking strong measures to free the country from Jewish Communists. The Executive Committee of the Third International has given orders that all deported Communists are to be supported both morally and materially from Russia. Sinister threats of future punishment of traitors have been made.7. CENTRAL ASIATIC STATES. AZERBAIJAN.The anti-Bolshevist rising is said to be gaining in strength. Tartars and&apos; Armenians are co-operating, and many Georgian and Red Army units are reported to have joined the insurgents. In the meantime the decision of the Russian Soviet to send some of the starving peasantry to Azerbaijan has increased anti-Bolshevik feeling. The export of grain to Russia is said to have been forbidden.TURKESTAN. Possible Effects of the Famine.The Council of Action and Propaganda are reported to be gravely exercised by the possible effect of the famine upon their activities in Turkestan. They fear that an influx of starving humanity into Turkestan may rouse the Turkish Moslems to retaliatory action which may nullify at a blow all the Council&apos;s work in that area. The Military Command in Turkestan has been ordered to check imme-diately this movement of peasantry, but at the same time the military authorities in Moscow are meditating the transfer, of various sickly military units from Russia to Turkestan. The danger of serious complications over the disposal of the harvest is great.Joffe Murdered.It was reported during August that Jo fie had gone to Tashkent with large sums for propaganda in India,   At the end of September,
however, Russian circles in Helsingfors were spreading a report of the murder of Joffre. This has since been denied by the Russian Press Bureau, which declares that Joffe is safe at Tashkent.GEORGIA.The Dead Hand of the Soviet.   -The Bolshevik tyranny is growing heavier. Fresh contributions, reaching a total of 50 milliard roubles, are now being extorted, and considerable quantities of commodities and wool commandeered. An urgent appeal has been issued on behalf of the Georgian people, &apos;&apos; groaning under the yoke of the invaders, suffering all the horrors &quot; of famine, typhus, cholera and plague, and reduced to the last stages &quot; of despair.&quot; The workmen of Tiflis have issued an appeal for help to all the workers of the world. They state that they are treated as slaves and deprived of all freedom. Compulsory labour, with martial law, has been imposed on all Georgian workers, without distinction of profession.A New Revolutionary President.Politically the most important recent event is the retirement of Makharadzo from the post of President of the Tiflis Revolutionary Committee and the nomination in his place of Budu Mdivani, until recently the representative of the Russian Soviet in Angora.. A dis-agreement with the majoritj&apos; of the Georgian Soviet over certain important questions is given as the official reason for the change; the actual reason is Makharadzo&apos;s refusal of Stalin s demand for the immediate arrest of certain prominent Georgian Mensheviks. The arrests were ultimately effected on the personal responsibility of Budu Mdivani.Concession.A message from Tiflis, sent via Moscow, announces that the repre-sentatives of Georgia and Abkhazia have concluded a contract for the working of the Zibskaya Forest Estate with two German subjects named Gersner and Chadaeff. The concession is for a term of 40 years; the concessionaires are obliged to build a 3,000 h.p. electric -station, wood-working, veneer and parquet factories. The Soviet Republics will receive up to 20 per cent, of the total output, and all the properties revert to them on the expiration of the lease. This concession may be merely a channel for possible German exploitation, and invalid in fact.ARMENIA.The present Soviet Government under the leadership of Myasnikian, is said to be in a fairly strong position. Myasnikian himself is rumoured to be more Nationalist than. Bolshevik, and to be doing his best to save the country from, utter ruin. The position is, liow-ever, desperate. There is no food; ^ tho bulk of the population is starving, half of it is malaria stricken, and in addition there are 40,000 orphans and 400,000 refugees to be looked after,
AFGHANISTAN.Moscow announces that tho Afghan Government has ratified the Russo-Afghan Treaty. Simultaneously comes a report that Rasko-linik, the first Ambassador of the Soviet Government, has arrived at Kabul. This man, who at one time was a prisoner-of - war in Brixton Gaol, commanded the Volga and Caspian fleets.during the civil war.Reports from India state that Djemal Pasha and Suritz, lately Russian Envoy at Kabul, recently left the Afghan capital. It is believed that Djemal Pasha is going to Herat, but his future movements are uncertain.8. FAR EASTERN STATES. SIBERIA.The Relations of Moscow with Siberia.A special committee sent to investigate the situation in Siberia has reported pessimistically to the Central Executive of the Russian Communist Party, in a document which is, in fact,, an avowal of the bankruptcy of the Soviet administration in Siberia. It is admitted that the &quot;injudicious&quot; reforms of the Bolsheviks have resulted in the transfer of hatred to the Soviet administration. For this Moscow-has largely to thank its persistence in appointing very inferior administrators to Siberia. But the soviet&apos;s worst blunder was the ruthless requisitioning of food stocks, compared with which Koltchak&apos;s punitive expeditions were child&apos;s play. This plundering has resulted in the peasants either refusing to sow any grain at all, or defending themselves by arms against food requisitioning detachments. The Communist workers, and even the Red troops, are not to be relied upon; the situation in Eastern Siberia, where anti-Soviet organisations are consolidating themselves, is increasingly serious for the Bolsheviks, and the report concludes by pointing out that the peasant risings will continue to develop, under conditions which make it practically impossible to subdue them. The only, remedy suggested is to transfer Bolshevik activities into the White centres which are functioning behind the Red forces.The Position at VladivostockInformation received towards the end of August stated that the position of the Vladivostock Government was weak and money scarce. The Kappel troops were dissatisfied with the policy of Merkulov and General Verjbitzky and were secretly in touch with Chita. They were also trying to establish relations with Moscow, and it appears that in the event of an attack by Chita they would not fight. Merkulov is unaware of this condition of things.Only a small section of KappeFs followers appears to favour the proposed amalgamation of the Chita and Vladivostock Governments. Another section wishes to bring about a *&amp;nn d&apos;:?tat with the co-operation of the Social Revolutionaries.JAPAN.The Japanese Home Office has recently issued instructions with regard to the control of Bolshevik propaganda,   These instructions
appear to have particular reference to a certain Shinho Kiyoshi, a propagandist whose return to Japan is anticipated to take place shortly. When the war broke out he was in Germany, where he is suspected of having worked for German interests. He has since been engaged in questionable activities between Siberia and Shanghai. He is a recent convert to Bolshevism, and has been devising methods for the spreading of Bolshevik propaganda in Japan.9. BRITISH COLONIES. CANADA.The Communist Party of Canada is reported to be organised in groups of from five to ten members, each group electing a group-captain. From the group captains are chosen the city or local organisers, and from these organisers are chosen the sub-district organisers, the highest elective position. The Central Executive Committee is elected by the convention, and the district organisers&apos; are appointed by the Central Executive Committee. The party bulletin for July states that the &quot; mass legal expression &quot; of the party will, be known as the Canadian Labour Alliance. It will&apos; federate all the.radical organisations controlled by Communist elements. The underground illegal jjarty is the directing force, and the above ground legal apparatus the practical expression or application of that force. The Communists continue to develop their schemes for the capture of the unemployed and the exploitation of their sufferings.It is now established that Soviet money has been sent into Canada to foster sedition. On the instructions of the Third International, the Pan-American Bureau in July sent $1,50(1 to the Communist Party of Canada in Toronto for its underground work! This sum appears in the financial statement as &quot; a donation from Larson.&quot; There is reason to believe that the cost of the Guelph convention was met from the same source, but this remains a surmise. The Com-munist Central Executive has issued a general order prescribing active &quot; germ-cell &quot; work in trade unions and other bodies.Rumours of an intended revolutionary outbreak in Vancouver are again current. Against them niay be set certain facts the better known extremist societies are imperfectly organised: they have encouraged their members to- visit the prairies for harvest work of a double kind; and they do not seem to contemplate immediate action. Many of the stories circulating may have their source in the uneasiness created by unemployment. The extremists are deriding and opposing the constructive plan for unemployment during the winter drawn up by the Economic Council, which represents about 30 societies and public bodies in Vancouver.Joseph R. Knight has returned to Toronto from Moscow. This man is now a member of the governing body of the Red Trade Union International, representing Canada and the United States, and has thus gained very considerably in importance. He intends to exploit the germ-cell system for all it is worth. His former associations with the now dying One Big Union will hamper him, and his relations with the jealous oligarchs who control the Communist Party of Canada
will bo difficult. The subordination of the Red Trade Union Inter-national to the Third International makes close co-operation imperative.Extremists in Trouble.Many members of the rank and file of the Canadian National Union of Ex-Servicemen have gone to the prairies, ostensibly for harvest work, but really to carry on propaganda amongst the harvesters. The Canadian National Union of Ex-Service Men are trying to induce the Japanese to join them, and have enlisted the Japanese newspapers in Vancouver in this cause.No success has so far attended the attempt to organise a branch of the Canadian National Union of Ex-Service Men in Calgary, and none is anticipated. The Winnipeg branch of the Union has suspended operations.The One Big Union and the Lumber Workers&apos; Industrial Union continue to decline. There is acute quarrelling in the One Big Union in Winnipeg.The standing of certain of the Vancouver extremist leaders, notably Jack Kavanagh, has declined.The Ukrainian Loan.The attempt which is being made among the Ukrainians to raise a loan of 81,000,000 known as the Western Ukrainian National loan, for the Western Ukrainian Republic, is reported to have started a considerable anti-Bolshevik reaction amongst the Ukrainians in Winnipeg and other places. The Bolshevik element is violently opposed to the loan, and is campaigning against it. The loan, however, seems to bo making little progress.Miscellaneous.Tom Roberts, a Communist agitator of Toronto, has managed to leave for England.Neil McLean, M.P., has been in Canada. His speeches in Winnipeg were rather mild.An English Communist, Stanley Kitchener, has attracted some attention at Michel. He is a Yorkshireman, who came to Canada last April, sent, it is understood, by the Communist Party for the purpose of agitation.John Macdonald, chief organiser of the Communist. Party of Canada, has been in Winnipeg, seeking to smooth over differences in the Ukrainian Communist movement, and to organise new under-ground groups.The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; states that the Canadian Government has formally invited Krassin to come to Canada and arrange a Russo-Canadian trade agreement. Foreign-born revolutionists are actively engaged in schemes of famine relief for Soviet Russia. The Ukrainian Labour Temple seems to have given its organisation to the work, with which goes a certain amount of propaganda.SOUTH AFRICA.The revolutionary factions in the Union are reported to be well established, and part of a world-wide organisation. Their appeal to a certain class of European and to the coloured masses is increasing, and their propaganda is helped by the present trade depression.
Unemployment was largely exploited at Cape Town, until the Unem-ployment Committee itself intervened. The Communists have now lost their headquarters in Cape Town. The undermining of the natives by organised revolutionary forces and there is evidence that the revolutionary ferment is making much discontent is con-stantly drawing comment from the police. In the Transvaal a native agitation is being fomented against the Poll Tax. Such affairs as Bullhoek are exploited by Europeans, against whom it is difficult to proceed under existing law. The Bullhoek agitation has, however, brought about the arrest of four individuals named W. Harrison, W. Dryburgh, D. L. Dryburgh and W. Green, on charges of defamatory libel and criminal libel. The Communists are collecting funds for the defence of these men.There is little change in the situation at Johannesburg. The International Socialists have now merged into the United Communist Party of South Africa, but the old avowed Communists are keeping aloof from the amalgamation. Communism attracts the vast majority of the extremists and agitators of Johannesburg, the International Socialists receiving little support.Patrick Little, &quot; envoy &quot; of de Valera in South Africa, has been engaged in a disturbing campaign since news was received of the truce.   His activities are conducted under Nationalist support.AUSTRALIA.According to the Moscow Wireless, a Communist school was opened in Sydney at the end of August. This is the first Communist school for proletarian children in Australia. The school is directed by Adele Pankhurst (?).The Australian Labour Party and the Australian Workers&apos; Union  the latter the oldest and most powerful union in Australia-are domi-nated by Roman Catholic elements, largely of Irish origin, and bitterly hostile to England, though their religious convictions make them a strong bulwark against Bolshevism. Political extremists are largely represented by the Socialist Labour Party of Australia, which preaches the social revolution, and persistently attacks and misrepresents England. Its doctrine differs little from that of the Communist Party of Australia (Australian section of the Third International), except that the latter advocates sabotage and the use of direct instead of political action. Sinn Fein is yet another subversive element. There seems, however, to be little chance of Bolshevism establishing itself in Australia. It has against it the great and dominant body of loyal citizens, who have withdrawn in disgust from the corruption of party politics, the powerful influence of the Roman Catholic Church, and the strong mass of land-owning farmers. The country is loyal, despite occasional surface ebullitions.The formation of a &quot; Council of Action &quot; by the Political Section of the All-Australian Union Congress has already been mentioned in the Review. The Industrial Section of the Congress had previously formed a Council of Action of its own, and both bodies had adopted revolutionary resolutions. The Ratification Conference of the australian -lian Labour Party, which was to be held at Brisbane on October 10th, was to decide which of these bodies should survive. The decisions of the Industrial Section were officially recommended for adoption The various extreme proposals down for consideration included the socialization of industrial production and distribution and a demand Q 16156 e
for the complete abolition of the present military expenditure and compulsory military training.There is much talk of an amalgamation of all Labour bodies to fight Capital, under the form of the One Big Union, but the idea is vigorously combated in many quarters. The Socialist Labour Party and the (Communists may possibly unite. The Industrial Workers of the World, now an illegal body, seem to have revived under the thin disguise of the World Workers&apos; Union. An amalgamation of tho Australian Transport Workers with the Australian Workers&apos; Union is spoken of.NEW ZEALAND.The New Zealand Workers&apos; Union has decided in favour of the formation of one big union and has adopted a scheme for amalgamation with the New Zealand Alliance of Labour, to be submitted to a plebis-cite of the workers under its control. Whether New Zealand workers will finally amalgamate with those of Australia on the same lines as they themselves are allied to the Australian Workers&apos; Union is, however, doubtful. There are indications that the One Big Union scheme is unpopular in Australia itself, and the violence advocated by the extremists who control the union has already led to secessions there.The New Zealand Labour Conference, which was held after the return of the delegates to an Australasian Labour Socialist Congress in Melbourne, formulated a policy of socialization similar to that announced by the Congress. The Congress decided to create a Supreme Economic Council elected by the workers, and set up a Council of Action which has among its aims to get into touch with the labour organisations in countries bordering the Pacific with the object of preventing future wars.Trouble with the Miners.The resolution passed at the annual Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation not to &quot; recognise the Arbitration Court under any con-sideration whatever &quot; may lead to important developments. If the miners act in accordance with this resolution they will be refusing to use the machinery provided by law for their benefit in matters affecting, them. The proposal of the Federation to the mine owners that a fresh agreement should be drawn up on the lines of the present national agreement was uncompromisingly rejected by the owners, who suggested local agreements. This action displeased the miners, who appear to suspect the owners of an intention to impose conditions similar to those superseded by the j)resent national agreement. A strike was threatened if any attempt were made to enforce a local agreement made by the Arbitration Court overriding the national one. A strike would not involve great hardships, since stocks are abundant and the worst of the winter is over.Miscellaneous.: Unemployment has latterly shown a slight decrease, but trade remains very depressed.The Arbitration Court has refused to reconsider its decision not to grant a cost of living bonus.Communist literature from Russia is being forwarded to the Dominion through Karl Malmstestein, Stockholm C, Postfack 853, Sweden, who is apparently a distributing agent for the Bolsheviks,
Violent statements were made at a meeting- of the Wellington Branch of the Self-Determination League for Ireland. One prominent Labour M.P. went so far as to say that a bigger bond of feeling existed between England arid Japan than between England and Ireland.The appeal by the Crown against the decision of the magistrate dismissing the men named Patrick Hodgens Hickey and John Glover, who were charged with inciting to sedition by printing and selling a pamphlet, &quot; Scotland&apos;s Tragedy, Ireland&apos;s Disgrace,&quot; has resulted in the conviction of the defendants, who were fined  5 and  2 respec-tively.10. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.The turbulent miners in West Virginia were finally dispersed by troops and many of them disarmed. The wilder spirits talk of fresh outbreaks and declare that they will never submit to outside pressure.It is reported that during his visit to Moscow, Senator France promised Lenin to do his utmost to create an atmosphere favourable to the ultimate acceptance of Litvinoff as Soviet emissary in the United States.   Kerjentseff has been mentioned as an alternative candidate.In his annual Labour Day message Gompers urges American labour to go forward towards more complete organisation, and towards a membership of five millions. The Secretary of Labour, Mr. Davies, has confirmed Gompers&apos; estimate of 6,000,000 unemployed, and has urged the undertaking of public works and other relief measures.Linn Gale, the editor of the revolutionary Communist &quot; Gale&apos;s Magazine,&quot; who is awaiting trial for evading the draft law, and for articles issued in his magazine, is reported to have offered to turn informer and tell the Government all he knows about extremists in the United States and Mexico in return for a promise of freedom.The American Labour Alliance of New York, a Bolshevik Asso-ciation composed mostly of Russian or Polish Jews, has adhered to the Third International and renamed itself &quot; Friends of Russia.&quot; A special committee for assistance to Russia has been formed. The Committee edits a newspaper caUed &quot;Soviet Russia,&quot; several members of the staff of which are to go to France charged with various missions.11. SOUTH AMERICAN  STATES. CHILE.A German Communist source announces a persecution of revolu-tionaries in Chili. Numerous arrests have been made, and the premises of various organisations have been destroyed. A four days&apos; general strike was declared as a protest against these actions.THE ARGENTINE.An Argentine section of Juvenile Communists, &quot; Federation Juventud-Communista,&quot; was recently formed. Moscow has dictated its methods of action and propaganda, which are on familiar lines. Army conscripts are instructed to remain exteriorly loyal soldiers, and to develop propaganda in the ranks by rapidly acquiring superior grades and using this military superiority to further their teaching. Isolated attempts at revolution are condemned.
PART II.1. THE REVIVAL OP RELIGION IN RUSSIA.The religious instinct, which in Russia can never be suppressed for long, has been finding its outlet by devious channels. The revival is in fact approaching a culmination. As regards the Orthodox Church, it is strongest in the cities and along the railways; where-ever, in fact, Bolshevik control is strongest, religious feeling, necessarily opposed to that control, has been growing.Rs growth synchronises with the return to their villages of demobi-lised army soldiers, who, with astonishing rapidity, lose their army veneer to become peasants. In a few weeks their change from a com-munist to a peasant smallowner is complete. On the land, ex-zealots of communism have develoiDed into ardent enemies of communal ownership and fight the higher organs of authority to the death.With these changes has come the religious revival. Women and men, old and young, have become something like religious enthusiasts. The. first days of the revolution undermined and shook the. prestige of the clergy. Now that these work on the land as hard as their own parishioners, the dividing wall between priest and peasant has fallen and priests are no longer open to the old taunt that they battened upon their people.In the country districts of the Volga region, where the priests were driven out or murdered, there have been curious reversions to primi-tive pagan forms of worship, among which various kinds of fetishism have largely figured. The peasants&apos; idol in these districts is generally a bull&apos;s head, which they hoist up info a tree and worship from below. But such idolatry belongs to the outlying country. In the towns, the Christian revival is gaining strength and generally there is a feeling that religion is the only common bond left to the Russian people. The Bolshevik authorities are becoming genuinely alarmed at the pro-cessions which they feel themselves powerless to prevent, especially as these processions consist of the very people who, from time to time, constitute the unwilling audience to harangues by Trotsky, Zinovieff, Bukharin and other &quot; enlightened &quot; leaders. The masses are, in fact, regaining their lost ideals.The revival is not due to any special ability or virtue on the part of the clergy, who generally and excusably contented themselves at first with leaving ill alone. It was futile from the beginning to attempt to resist the Bolsheviks by force, and passivity was the better part. Religion survived the flood, and the Soviet leaders themselves now recognise that the Church is the only organisation outside the Govern-ment which has the power, the will and the means to assist in famine relief.When the Czar was deposed, the Patriarch Tikhon wisely accepted the position of head of the Russian Church and kept his Synod about him. The Orthodox Church was thus kept intact under its former headship despite the elimination of the Czar, its theoretical head. The Patriarch remains in constant communication with his Bishops and the latter with their clergy. The Synod sits regularly in Moscow and the Bolsheviks have for some time past ceased to interfere with its activities,
In July the Patriarch and Church Synod decided to appeal to tha heads of the Christian Churches to relieve the famine, and telegrams, to the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Evangelical Archbishop of New York were actually drafted. It has not been the least of the crimes of the Bolsheviks that they, who are at present screaming for the relief of the hunger stricken, for months were assiduous in concealing the need for such relief. They suppressed the appeals. But not for long. Presently Lenin, by and with the consent of the Council of People&apos;s Commissars, sent Maxim Gorki to request that the Patriarch should appeal not only to the heads of Churches, but also to the heads of all Christian States. Tikhon replied that he had already done his best to do the former. Gorki said the suppression of the appeals was a mistake.. Gorki, i begged the Patriarch, as all material means had failed, to order prayers for the salvation of Russia.He might have based his request on spiritual failure as well. The rulers of Russia, after their wont, were not without arriere pehser. It has since been ascertained that, in enlisting the Patriarch&apos;s services,, the Government, guided by Lenin, hoped not only to obtain famine relief, but regarded the appeals as a subsidiary means for entering into diplomatic relations with the Western States.An upright man in his plain dealing is often a match for the astutest contriver. Tikhon refused. Negotiations with the heads of foreign Governments, he said, were not for him. He consented to approach the heads of Christian Churches, with results which have been made public. It was the Patriarch&apos;s wish that foreign promoters of famine relief should conduct their activities through the Church, whose power and influence, he is convinced, would suffice to direct relief into the&apos; proper channels. Ah emissary of his sent abroad at the end of July had instructions to suggest to the heads of Christian Churches that if the Church were able to relieve the Russian people, the Russian j)people would.look to. it as their saviour. He pointed out also that control of distribution, by the Government would mean that the army, its own officials, and supporters would be given priority. Tikhon ended by saying that he was no politician and that he spoke merely as the head of the national, church.More recently it has been, reported from a good source that Tikhon, has not/confined his activities as head of the Russian Church to matters of relief, but has been in communication with the Pope on matters of the first importance to the Christian Church as a whole. Neither&apos; the outcome of these negotiations nor even the exact grounds on which they were commenced is yet known, but it would appear that certain of the more important points of controversy between the two Churches have been eliminated. Tikhon has easily assumed the position as Head of the Orthodox Church since the death of the Czar. In doing this he has merely reverted to the organisation existing before the days of Peter the Great, and the authorities of the Orthodox Church are fully determined that this Headship shall not again be relinquished to a civil power, even if a Czar again rules Russia at some future date. Secondly, the ,controversy concerning the use of. statues in churches largely disappears owing both to the effect of time since the dispute originated and also the fact that a large portion of the Catholic Church uses all the rites and ceremonies of the Orthodox Church. Further it is believed that the third great controversy over the Filioque Clause is regarded by many Orthodox theologians as one
which arose largely through misinterpretation. Thus, while any definite act of union is probably impossible at the present time for political and social reasons, the establishment of better relations between the two Churches, combined with an interchange of ideas, would lay the foundation for more intimate conferences, and it is understood that a large section of ecclesiastical thought in the Orthodox Church would welcome an opportunity for discussion. The Vatican, while making no pronouncement regarding the possibility of reunion, has shown itself more than willing to open the road for a better understanding, and it may be noted that the Russian Famine Relief Fund has benefited by a very large contribution made to it by the Pope.Meanwhile, the religious revival as a whole is not confined to the Orthodox Church. In addition to the curious lapses into paganism previously noticed, strong bodies of Catholics, Uniates, Methodists and even Theosophists have been formed during the past eight months in all big cities, dissonant in doctrine among themselves, but united in their opposition to Bolshevik theory. The Uniate Church, with the ritual of the Greek and the dogma of the Latin, has been gaining ground in Moscow, where it previously has had small scope, its main stronghold having been in the South. The growing strength of this Church, which recognises the Pope as its Supreme Head, may not be without influence upon any negotiations which may be pending between the Roman and Orthodox Churches.3. THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL AND INDIA : MAHENDRA NATH ROY AND VIRENDRANATH CHATTOPADHAYA.&quot;The. Russian Government .&apos;. . wishes to state most emphatically that since the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Agreement, it had no dealings, direct or indirect, with Mr. Chatlopadhaya or any other Indian revolutionaries, that there exists no propaganda school in Tashkent for preparing emissaries for India, that it has never had any contact whatever with Dr. Hafiz, and has no knowledge of his factory of smokeless powder.&quot;  Litvinoff, in the Russian Soviet Official reply to Lord Curzon&apos;s Note&apos; of September 7th.An article in Part II. of the number of this Review for March, 1.921, dealt with the &quot;Indian Provisional Government&quot; and the Indian Committee in Berlin, and with the efforts of Virendranath Chatto-padhaya, the moving spirit of the latter body, to unite the various sections of the Indian Revolutionary Party. Chattopadhaya had: left Berlin for Moscow on March 1st and was about to endeavour to arrange a Conference there of Indian delegates who would go to Moscow via Berlin, where the Oriental section of the German Foreign Office was encouraging their project.Reports more recently received now enable us to follow the fortunes of the assembled Indian revolutionaries and to map out pretty accurately the intestine divisions between the parties which subse-quently arose.In Berlin the Soviet Delegation helped the Indians financially. Eight of them received 5,000 marks each for travelling expenses; three received from 10,000 to 15,000 marks each for clothes, and
Chattopadhaya received 15,000 kronen for his private debts : for the second time, since he admitted in Moscow that he had received 30,000 in all.On their arrival in Moscow, the Indians from Berlin and elsewhere were received by a representative of the Foreign Office and housed and fed as guests of the Third International. They found that Mahendra Nath Roy, the Indian Communist, naturalised Mexican, frequently mentioned in&apos; previous reports, was well installed, and had, since his coming to Russia from Mexico nearly a year before, gained the confidence of the Soviet authorities, and, in particular, the ear of Lenin. At the first meeting of Indians on June 12th, ou Roy&apos;s return from Tashkent, Roy said that after his arrival in Russia, during 1920, he had been granted 10 million gold roubles for revolu-tionary agitation in India. He had, moreover, accompanied convoys of military material and aeroplanes forwarded by the Soviet Government to the. Indian frontier via Afghanistan, where the Afghans, however, in distrust of the Bolsheviks, had refused entry both to the munitions and to himself. He described his subsequent appointment by the Third International as secretary to the Oriental Propaganda Department in Tashkent. To Chattopadhaya and his Nationalists, Roy, however, refused to give any account of the activities of his Communist Party. Unlike the newcomers, whose revolt against the British Empire is nationalist and religious, Roy stood for Communist Revolution by an uprising of the labouring masses in India. Large sums of money had been given him by Moscow for the purpose of financing propaganda in India in order to start a revolution there on Communist lines, and the one flaw in his reputation was caused by the defalcations of, certain of his agents, who, as soon as they were beyond his reach, had pocketed the money entrusted to them. Of this incident, the Berlin group of Nationalists took full advantage. But the months of intrigue and defamation which followed ended in their defeat, and at the Third Congress of the Communist International, the theses on the Oriental question presented by Roy were accepted. It was decided that Roy&apos;s work would be earned on by the Indian Communist Party in Moscow, and that all Indians calling themselves Communists might affiliate to that party, which would have a bureau and a training school, and would operate in India itself as heretofore through Kabul and Tashkent. By August 20th, classes had already been opened in the University and 1.7 students had enrolled. Moscow further decided that the Nationalist &quot; Indian Provisional Government &quot; and Chattopadhaya&apos;s Nationalist Committee in Berlin must seek elsewhere for help and that the International could not aid Nationalist causes except through a Communist Party as intermediary.In Moscow, therefore, the cause of &quot; bourgeois &quot; Indian nationalism is gravely shaken. It was not improved by the rather obvious attempts of the Nationalist, B. N. Das Gupta alias Haider, one of Chattopadhaya&apos;s principal lieutenants in Berlin, to induce the Soviet Government to enable him, while carrying on Indian propaganda work in Europe, to put his own personal affairs on a sound financial footing. The Committee of the Third International which went into the business were brought to believe that the main purposes of B. N. Das Gupta and Abdul Wahid, another of Chattopadhaya&apos;s lieutenants, were merely to get money for their Own personal use under cover of the Cause.   The Third International noted all the faults of the Berlin
revolutionaries; their divisions among themselves (some few of theni oven intrigued themselves into supporting Roy whom as a body it was their business to attack), their jealousy against Roy, their mean-ness, their hankering after money, their crude hypocrisy and selfishness, all converted the orthodox Roy into an angel of light.In accepting the theses of Mahendra Nath Roy and in rejecting those of the Indian comrades in Europe and America with &quot; their very hazy and old ideas of the Indian movement,&quot; Moscow has once more decided against what it calls the &quot; sentimentalists &quot; in- revolu-tionary matters.A clear light has been shed on the whole business by certain intercepted letters.These letters, addressed by Mahendra Nath Roy and his wife, Mrs. Elena Roy alias Allen, to Professor Beooy Kumar Sarkar, the from-nent Indian revolutionary,* and a Mr. Vincent, have been obtained in original, sent to England, closely examined and photographed. There is no doubt of their authenticity.   They consist of: 1. A covering envelope (postmark Tallinn. Esthonia) addressed M. Andre Varagnac, Boulevard St. Germain 134, Paris, and enclosing two envelopes addressed (a) Professor Benoy Sarkar, e/o M. Andre Varagnac, and (6) for Mr. Vincent, kindness of Professor Sarkar.2. In 1 (a): two typed letters, (a) Moscow August 13, &quot; Dear Professor Sarkar,&quot; signed &quot; Roy &quot; (Mahendra Nath Roy), (b) August 20, 1921. &quot; Dear Benoy,&quot; signed, after manuscript addition &quot; E. R.&quot; (Elena Roy).3. In 1 (b) : two letters, (a) Typed. 17th August, 20. &quot; Dear Mr. Vincent &quot; ; signed &quot; Elena &quot; (Elena Roy). (6) MS. Aug. 13. ;&apos; My dear Com. Vincent &quot; . . . &quot;with best regards, Roy,&quot; (Mahendra Nath Roy).The following extracts from these letters sufficiently dispose of a central untruth in LitvinofFs reply on September 27th, in the name of the Soviet Government, to Lord Cur7.on&apos;s Note of September 7th, an extract of which stands as a heading of this article.From 2 (a).   [Malwndra Nath Roy.)&quot; Since arriving here a year ago we did the best we could to create a position for us here, and our efforts have not been un-successful. But from the very beginning our activities were handicapped owing to the lack of sufficient able and experienced workers. Therefore our comrades in Europe and America were repeatedly asked to come and join us. It took them almost a year to make up their mind; but when at last they did come, we were surprised to find in them not comrades and co-workers willing to join hands in the work started, but rivals burning with bitter jealousy, determined to discredit us by all means. , Well, I don&apos;t think it necessary to relate the sad and disgusting story. The only thing that every Indian should be told is that during the last three months the very name &quot; Indian revolu-tionary &quot; had become odious to everybody; it means dirty intrigues, back-bitings, petty bickerings and what not. The result is that all that was created by the hard struggle of a year* Professor Benoy Kumar Sarkar has recently been offered the: leadership of the Indian Revolutionary Party in Berlin simultaneously with the Chair of Oriental Philosophy at Hamburg.
lias practically been destroyed in three months. It was im-possible for me to save it. . . . The most useful service that can be rendered to the movement by us is to help it (the move-ment) clarify its ideology. Being outside and having had the opportunity of coming in contact with other movements, we have acquired a new perspective of what is happening in India to-day. The men who are working in the country have neither time nor opportunity nor the training necessary to be able to see through the multitudinous social intricacies which underlie the rather chaotic development of the Indian movement. In j*roportion as these social intricacies are recognised and proper efforts are made to understand their vital relation with the revolutionary struggle, the latter would become a part of the every day life of the masses of people who constitute the real nation, if any such thing does exist outside the domain of pure politics. Here lies the work which we, living and learning outside, are called upon to do. Those who would devote themselves to this work will find themselves spared from the unpleasantness of getting involved in the petty jealousies and dirty intrigues for power and unearned gold.&quot; From 2 (b).   (E. Roy.)&quot; The Indian Question has been decided since my husband wrote you the enclosed letter, and this is just a note to tell you that- the International has definitely decided upon its future policy of only recognising and giving help to Communist parties, who can themselves, if they wish, aid nationalist movements. More than this, our group has been recognised unconditionally as the one with which the International will work in future, as it has worked for the past year.* Our European friends came here with the idea, not as I had hoped, of co-operating, but of obstructing and destroying the work done, of upsetting the existing people at the head of our work here and themselves taking their places. In this they have failed, and as they refuse to join with and co-operate with us, in spite of all of them having declared themselves here as Communists, I suppose the only thing left for them to do is to return to Europe and begin&apos; their campaign of lies and defamations against us, our work and theInternational......Our University course has been opened and we have seventeen students of economics, political science and communism enrolled. They will be good workers some day.....We shall stick to the Communist pro-gram and the organisation of a Communist party.&quot;From 3 (a).   (E. Boy.)&quot;I found our affairs just approaching a decision upon my arrival, and the decision itself was formally given out four days ago. All work is to be carried on by the Communist Party which, already exists here, and to which all those who call themselves Communists may affiliate; here will be established the bureau for our work and the training school for such of our people as wish to avail themselves of it.* Classes have already been opened in the University, and we have seventeen students enrolled. Their course will last three months, as they have already had some preliminary training with us. All this is very disconcerting to our friends from Europe, who came here apparently with the* Italics of Directorate of Intelligence.&apos;
primary object, next to getting money, of conducting a campaign of defamation and destruction of the work already commenceda year ago.....There has been no effort made to get together and come to a common understanding. The one joint meeting that was called of the two groups ended in a riot, dis-graceful to our cause, and no further attempts at political future were made. Negotiations have been carried on through a Coin-mission appointed by the International to study the question and to present some solution. Their decision, and the decision of the Executive of the International, I have given above. All Nation-Nationalists are to seek elsewhere for help, as it has been decided, and wisely we think, that the International cannot aid, except through a Communist Party as intermediary, nationalist causes.* Every effort will be bent upon building up a strong Communist Party within the country, using those elements which we have outside who are really Communist, as preliminary workers. Head-quarters will be here, and a journal issued.As all those who came from Europe declared themselves openly here to be Communists, the next logical step would be for them to affiliate themselves with the Party which was, formed here last September, and which has been formally recognised by the International. But this they refuse to do, saying that they do not recognise this party, that it must be broken up and a new one formed with themselves as heads of it. . . . One result has been achieved. We have found that as Communists we must stick to our program and party and work on those lines, leaving the Nationalists to work in their own way. Any kind of working agreement, except for the first step, overthrow of foreign rule, is impossible. Let the strong nationalist movement there run its course, we must busy ourselves with building up the next stage of the revolution, the Communist one. I trust j&apos;ou will agree with this. The first necessity of the movement as a whole is the crystallization of ideology into parties, political parties not personal ones, which will each adopt its own program and educate the people to its own ideas, each conduct its own campaign of propaganda, and so spur each other on and the movement as a whole progress.&quot;Roy comments with some bitterness on the theoretical and intel-lectual weakness of the Indian movement as a whole. This weakness he and his school intend to cure. But if Roy&apos;s speech on the Oriental question at the Third Congress of the Third International (June-July 1921) is a fair sample of their prescription, it is questionable if its strained, tight logic is not worse than the disease. Mahendra Nath Roy attributes the scarcely shaken firmness of European capital-ism in face of the attack of its own proletariat to its imperial expansion and exploitations of the great non-European markets-and peoples.He argues as follows :-The War has left two great capitalist colonial empires : the United States of America, now devoted to the exploitation of the New World, and Great Britain, which has annexed to its empire &quot; practically the entire continents of Asia and Africa.&quot; Meanwhile, continental Europe, bankrupt and dislocated, has become the economic dependent of one or other of the two. A vast Oriental empire enables British capital to maintain its position at home and to increase its international* Italics of Directorate of Intelligence.
sopower. Its destruction is a vital factor if capitalist order in Europe is to be overthrown. The advanced proletariat of Europe cannot achieve this overthrow alone. It must be helped by colonial and subject countries like India, whose greater economic, industrial and political development render them the principal economic and military support to the imperial capital. India and the great countries of the East have now become an integral part of the capitalist world.This is what Nationalists have been forgetting and this is why mere nationalist agitation will not solve the real problem, which is the overthrow of capitalism.As regards the Mussulman countries of the Near and Middle East the Nationalists are right in regarding religious fanaticism of the masses and anti-foreign sentiment as forces for the undermining of imperialism; but as regards India they are wrong. India, controlled and exploited by capital, mainly imperial, but also partly and increas-&apos; ingly native, cannot rely on the antagonism to the foreign ruler of its liberal bourgeoisie, which, if it stands at the front of the National Democratic movement,- does so only in order to dispute with the Imperial ruler for the right to exploit native resources and Indian labour. Success in the Nationalist sense would only mean that the native bourgeoisie would become in its turn the oppressor of the landless peasantry, which, growing in class consciousness in proportion to the industrialization of the country, constitutes the real foundation for future revolution in India.Temporarily &quot; bourgeois &quot; Nationalism will ,serve in India, but it is unreliable and. foreign imperialism will be disposed of only in the historic struggle for economic emancipation which will unify the exploited class. Pan-Islamism is out of date. Its revolutionary character has gone and it rests to-day only on the most reactionary and counter-revolutionary elements.The Indian movement, in fact, according to Roy, is rapidly transcending the narrow limits of bourgeois nationalism and entering the arena of class struggle. The fight between the Indian bourgeoisie and British Imperialism is not a class struggle and so cannot be uncompromising and unrelenting. The liberation of India is the task of the class-conscious proletariat backed by the masses of pauperised peasantry. These cannot be excited to active revolution by the sloppy sentiment of bourgeois opportunists. A political party of the working masses must be formed and Roy, with the approval of Moscow, is devoting himself to the task. Not that the Nationalists may not have their uses also. Let their movement run its. course. In the somewhat-abstract phraseology of Mrs. Roy, &quot; The first necessity of the movement is the crystallization of ideology into parties, political not personal, which will each adopt its own programme and educate the people to its own ideas, each conduct its own campaign of pro-paganda and so spur on the others and the movement as a whole to progress.&quot;In supporting the theses of Mahendra Nath Roy, Moscow appears once more to have yielded to the fascination of a phrase.   AdvocacyI of &quot; The revolt of the labouring masses &quot; and a repudiation of &quot; Nation-alist sentimentality &quot; is music in the ears of Lenin and the Thirdj International. But in sacrificing the &quot; sentimental&quot; Nationalists they let go the bird in the hand.   It is doubtful whether Mahendra
Nath Roy, if he had been actually sent to Moscow by the wicked great ones of Western Imperialism with tho apple of discord, could have served their turn better.3. THE UKRAINIAN MOVEMENT IN CANADA.An Ukrainian movement, in the main Nationalist and cultural, but to some extent revolutionary, has for some years been growing in Canada. While rougher and not so highly French polished, its general shape resembles the Irish Abbey Theatre movement inaugurated in the late &apos;nineties by W. B. Yeats, &quot; AE,&quot; Douglas Hyde and Lady Gregory.In the movement in Canada the Ukrainians take the lead, though Russians proper show signs of attraction. As the Ukrainians number from 250,000 to 300,000 and the Russians something under 100,000 the movement affects not much less than 400,000 of what used to be considered New Canadians.War and revolution and the sentiment of nationality consecrated by the Treaty of Versailles have affected these*people deeply. When they first emigrated they went to Canada as to a country of hope where they could escape the oppressions of Europe, and for a time their prevailing sentiment was one of admiration for the native Canadian and Canadian civilisation. But not all of them made good, and now, belonging largely to the poorer elements of the community, they see their own class and even their own relatives at home seize control of power and acquire all property.The years of their sojourn in Canada have moreover to some extent been years of disillusion. Passionately fond of music, the drama and the more primitive pictorial and applied arts, they have come to a country for which, as for Australia, Mrs. Meynell has coined the apt word &quot; de-civilised.&quot; Already inclined to regard Canada as Philistine, revolution has made them disparage it as backward and still under capitalist control. The abler among them have also had cause to feel the exclusiveness of the ordinary Canadian towards the new Canadian, and Canadian critics themselves say that by keeping those who have prospered out of the ordinary association of business men their people are giving the separatist forces leaders who are not soured failures, but successful, able, energetic, and embittered. One result has been the establishment of separatist voluntary schools, whose tone is generally opposed to Canadianisation ; and though this anti-public school movement so far probably only reaches a few hundred children, the Canadian authorities. regard with anxiety the prospect some years hence, when these few hundred young Ukrainians will come into Canadian life systematically bred to race and class hatred.The curriculum of these schools is attractive : much of the teaching consists of music, singing and the drama, media through which the adult community of Ukrainians is also being assailed with a singular unifor-mity of plan and purpose from the St. Lawrence River to the Pacific Ocean.This strong cultural movement is considerably influenced by revolutionary elements. Revolutionary organisation among Ukrai-nians in Canada is strong and coherent. Centring in the Ukrainian Labour Temple at Winnipeg, it maintains relations with smaller organisations in the United States and establishes local organisations
in Ukrainian communities in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Hamilton, Fort William, Regina, Saskatoon, Edmonton, Vancouver, &amp;c. In many of the separatist voluntary schools revolutionary teaching predominates, and many of the touring concert and dramatic com-panies which are put on for Ukrainian adult audiences are revolu-tionary in their appeal. All over the country revolutionary concerts and dances are continually taking place, with revolutionary songs, one or two revolutionary speeches and finally a dance. Revolutionary plays, absurd enough, some of them, and technically primitive and poor, are also given. The synopsis of one such play, acted by local amateurs in a village in Saskatchewan, was as follows : A rich Ukrainian land-owner has two children, a son and a daughter, who go to the university and become Marxists. They ask for a good deal of money to spend on their revolutionary plottings. Their father thinks it is being spent in dissipations. He brings them home. The young people quarrel with their father&apos;s guests and insult the priest. The priest denounces them for keeping revolutionary litera-ture. The father orders them out of the house and draws up a will leaving his property to the priest, whom the girl shoots. At a trial in which the author contrives to set capitalist justice in a distorting and preposterous light, the boy is sentenced to death, and the girl to 20 years&apos; imprisonment. Before her term is up the revolution is represented to have taken place. The girl is restored to a sympathetic mother while the father shoots himself.Melodramatic and amateurish as this play was both in contrivance and performance, the effect of it was reported to have been powerful. Women sobbed and men grew tense with excitement. Other dramas are reported as crude and intensified variations of Mr. Galsworthy rs &quot; Justice,&quot; the actors taking themselves very seriously, so that when once a sad tragedy of capitalism was so ludicrously given, that the audience laughed, the chief actor rebuked them indignantly and com-manded them to feel the proper emotions.Rudimentary as the whole movement is, it has the advantage of being a spontaneous expression of deeply-seated racial aptitudes, and of being rooted in a common people, numerous enough to have momentum, and few enough to stick together as an unpopular minority. Home sick and torn by the consciousness of racial defeat, their ancestral religion challenged, they are undergoing the exciting and disturbing experience of finding their place and their level in a new.and rather overbearing type of civilisation. They stretchout their hands towards poetry and towards the drama.Meanwhile their movement is having effects more immediately political. Mass meetings are being held throughout Canada by Ukrainians other than those of the revolutionary party to send tele-grams and resolutions to the Supreme Council at Paris asking for the recognition of Eastern Galicia as an independent State.Dr. Longin Zehelsky, representative of the West Ukrainian Galician National Republic at Washington, has announced a proposed loan to further this object. This loan is described as the first national loan for subscription in Canada among immigrants from Galicia and Northern Bukowina, and was announced by Dr. Zehelsky as of one million dollars. Zehelsky appears, however, to have arranged to float the million dollar loan without the sanction of his chiefs in Europe, who have now gent two authorised representatives with the authority of the President
of the Republic to raise $100,000 in the United States. The Ukrainian Bolshevik agitator, Joseph Magas, lias been urging his following among Ukrainians to remain in communion with the rest of the Reds as &quot; there are a number of Ukrainians belonging to Ukrainian demo-cratic labour parties who are trying to raise throughout the United States and Canada 100,000 dollars for the purpose of wiping out the Third International and Bolshevism from Ukrainian countries.&quot;Meanwhile Zehelsky and the Social Democrat and reactionary Ukrainians are continuing their anti-Bolshevik propaganda by press and special means, while leanings towards Bolshevik Russia are reported to be weakening, and Ukrainians generally are said to be against the union with Russia altogether.It has been learned from an exceedingly reliable source that this tendency has not escaped the notice of M. Krassin, who is said actually to have made preliminary advances to leading Ukrainians in Canada and the United States with the object of financing, first, the breaking away of the Ukrainians from Soviet Russia, and even, in the second place, the continuance of the movement into Soviet Russia itself, for the purpose, there is some cause to believe, of finally supei-seding the Soviet government.4. THE FOURTH OR COMMUNIST WORKERS&apos; INTERNATIONAL.The Communist Workers&apos; International, founded towards tho end of September in Berlin, claims that its German section already numbers 80,000, and that it receives support in Czecho-Slovakia, Serbia. Bulgaria, Holland, England, and even from the large group of irreconcilable-cilables of the extreme Left (Radek, Bukharin) in Russia itself. Adopting all the theses and points of the Moscow International, it resembles the Communist Workers&apos; Party (K.A.P.D.) in Germany in that it rejects the directive of Moscow and aims at the political, and organisational liberation of the International from the Russian State policy. The Russian comrades, it holds, must transform their Russian International into a real International. National sections must be left to work out their own salvation in the West European Revolution. In the revolutionary sphere, that is, it is analogous rather to the British than to the German theory of Empire.The fundamental internal difference, however, is the opposition of the new group to Parliamentary and Trade Union action. Lenin has instructed adherents to the Third International to become can-candidates for Parliament and to work with Trade Unions with the purpose, if they are elected, of demonstrating the inanity of Parlia-mentary and Trade Union institutions. To this policy the sections of the Fourth International are entirely opposed and their strategy consists of opposition to every capitalist institution, and toleration of none, even for a purpose.The birth of the new party has not been an easy one. In Germany its principal leaders in public are Seeman and Emfel, while the &quot;l5mi-nence grise &quot; of the movement is reported to be one Utzelmann; the Gross-Dresden group, however, of the Communist Labour Party, headed by a certain Herr Lewinsohn, has seceded to the.United Communist Party (V.K.P.D.) and has stated the reasons for its action in a resolution giving a very adverse criticism of the plan for a n^v
Communist International, which, the resolution states, would in the best case turn out an international discussion club for ambitious litterateurs, and perhaps even an international union of individual terrorists.The party, has, however, met with some approval abroad, and several Communist groups outside Germany have announced that they will adhere to the new International. In England the group of Sylvia Pankhurst and Nora Smythe, which was recently expelled from the Communist Party of Great Britain on disciplinary grounds, has announced its adherence in its organ &quot; The Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot;; in Holland such well-known revolutionaries as Roland Hoist, Pannekoek, Gorier, and, more recently, Van Leuven, have joined the new International; while in the United States of America it is possible that a nucleus of a Fourth International orga-nisation may be formed round Louis Fraina.) tinted by EYF.p aud Spottjs^qobb, Ltd., East Harding Street, E,C. 4
