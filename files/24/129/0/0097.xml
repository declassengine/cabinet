This document is the propeny of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government SECRET.CP. 3495.5$  i?THE CABINET.PAY OF MAJOR-GENERALS SIR G. J. MELLISS AND SIR W. T. DELAMAIN WHILE PRISONERS OF WAR.MEMORANDUM- BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I fully share the regret of the Secretary of State for India, expressed in his Memorandum OP. 3375, that it should be necessary to trouble the Cabinet with this detail, but the principle involved; as in other financial questions that arise between the War Office and the India Office, is of great importance. In the event of difference of opinion; does the decision to throw a charge on Army Votes lie in the last resort with the Secretary of State for India or the Secretary of; State for War ? Successive Secretaries of State for War have taken the position in connection with this case that, although troops borrowed from India are entitled without question to the full benefit of Indian regulations, yet when it is proposed to go&apos; beyond or &quot;to alter these regulations, entirely -at the expense of the British taxpayer, the decision should rest ultimately with the Secretary of State for War and in deciding he may properly attach weight to the treatment given under like conditions to officers of the British establishment. -In thisT feel bound to stand by my predecessor in office. The War Office accept generally the statement of the case in the India Office memorandum, but would add that : (i.) The rules as to the pay of Indian Army officers taken prisoners of war were draWn up in concert between the two Departments. When later the India Office discovered that they had been under a misapprehension as to the British rules, the Indian rules were amended vvith the concurrence of the War Office. This misapprehension on the part of the India Office related only to the case of regimental officers and not to that of general officers who had been dealt with separately throughout.(ii.) The India Office claim that, if the emoluments of the British Service officers are raised, the emoluments of Indian Army officers of corresponding rank must be raised in the same proportion, in order that the relative financial position of the Indian Army officers shall be maintained. The War Office do not admit the principle of this claim. The War Office have, however, always agreed that Indian Army officers should receive not less than British Service officers holding similar appointments or than Indian- Army officers of lower rank.Accordingly, when the pay of the British Service Brigade Commander was raised from 590/. per annum to 800/. pei\ annum, and that of the British Service Divisional Commander from 1,021/. per annum to 1,150/. per i annum, it was agreed that the pay of the Indian Army Brigade Commander and the Indian Army Divisional Commander should&apos; be brought up to the same level. As, however, the Indian Army Battalion Commander received 1,015/., the Indian Army Brigade Commander was permitted to draw this rate as an over-riding minimum, although this was much higher than the &quot;British Service Brigade Commander&apos;s rate of 800/. In the British Service, pay is governed by the appointment and not by the rank, and a higher rate of pay is not admissible for a Brigade Commander if he happens to be a Major-General.
(iii.) Emphasis is laid by the India Office on the injustice of paying the Indian Army Brigade Commander not more than, the Indian Army Battalion Commander serving under him. The India Office, however, appear to overlook the fact that to pay the Indian Army Brigade Commander 1,200 . a year while the Commander of the whole Force, General Townshend, who was a British Service officer, only received 1,150?. a year (the rate for a British Service Divisional Commander) is still more unjust.The statutory objection raised by the Secretary of State. for India rests on Section LV. of the Government of India Act, 1858, which reads : &quot; Except for preventing or repelling actual invasion of Her Majesty&apos;s Indian Possessions, or under other sudden and urgent necessity, the revenues of India shall not, without .the consent of both Houses of Parliament, be applicable to defray the expenses of any military operations carried on beyond the extreme frontier of such Possessions by- Her Majesty&apos;s Forces chargeable upon such revenues.&quot; -I do not think that this was ever intended to be used as the basis of narrow auditorial objections to prevent the Government of India from dealing at its Own cost with its own officers in a special case like this; but whatever the legal difficulties may be, I am quite sure the Government of India Act was not intended to give the Indian Government the power of imposing charges on the British taxpayer.L. W.-E.The War Office,21st November, 1921.
