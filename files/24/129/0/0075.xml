This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.CP. 3474.x i. ili noi i !.&quot;o;:i &quot;ji&apos;r...vi the CABINET.THE SITUATION IN THE NEAR EAST.     ,h2193MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The discussion at the Cabinet (84 (21)) held on 1st November&apos; on our graeco-     121 Turkish policy, is to be resumed, and I ask that consideration  should-be&apos;given to the following : Our policy has been one of neutrality, but we have generally been credited with favouring the Greeks against the Turks. The latter view has been instilled into the Turks both by the French and the Italians.Although we have been willing, and have endeavoured, to effect a settlement between the Greeks and the Turks, we have failed, because neither the Greeks, when the military position seemed favourable to them, nor the Turks, in their turn, would abate their claims sufficiently ; moreover, we have been tied to our Allies, the French and Italians, not to take separate action, whereas they have not hesitated through their agents to make love to the Turks, and the former have actually come to an agreement with them.Lord Curzon has shown how disloyal is the Franklin Bouillon Agreement. He proposed to make a protest to the French, and since the Cabinet Meeting that fact has been published in the British Press, and various references and counter-attacks have appeared in the French Press.Some of the writers in the French Press seem to justify the Franklin Bouillon Agreement as a necessary measure in view of the British attitude regarding King Feisal and King Constantine.. I cannot doubt that the French Government must adopt the agreement, because they cannot withdraw their troops from Cilicia except with the goodwill of Mustapba Kemal, and his goodwill can only be purchased at the price of this agreement.If we protest, excuses or reasons may be given which at best will leave our relations with France less satisfactory, or at worst may lead to serious differences; but the want of money drives the French to withdraw the troops, and she cannot fail to adopt the agreement, notwithstanding all our protests.The mere fact that we make protests will also be used as propaganda against us in the Moslem world.    . *I expect that the next step will be that the French will remove their troops from Ismid and Constantinople. How can they make peace with Kemal in Angora and fight him in the Ismid area ? I think I see signs that if we protest against this also, the excuse will come that a Turkish gendarmerie is to be formed under French officers and that troops are no longer necessary.If the French withdraw these troops or even if they cannot be relied upon in case of Kemalist risings or attacks, it is unsafe to keep our small forces in Constantinople and the neighbourhood and we may at any time be forced to withdraw.Can we not usefully withdraw now and by so doing counteract the advantage gained by the French in their recent policy ?The telegram of 11th October (CP. 3412) from the Viceroy shows how urgent he thinks it to make some announcement of policy with regard to the Turkish position ; he presses with all the earnestness he can command the vast importance to India of so doing.Sir George Lloyd, in his telegram of 15th October (CP. 3423), urges his opinion that it is imperative that action should be taken on the Turkish question which should restore the lost faith of Islam in our attitude towards it.(B21/350)   100   11/21   H&amp;S, Ltd.   9547wo
Our position in Iraq depends upon peace in Mosul, which is directly threatened if the Kemalists choose to avail themselves of the Franklin Bouillon Agreement.Our position in Egypt and Palestine would certainly be rendered more difficult if we are driven out of our advanced positions in Iraq, and if Feisal falls, or even goes over to Kemal. The Greeks have now agreed to intervention and by acting at once we may save their faces by some arrangement which appears to give them some footing in Smyrna and Thrace.I propose that we should at once announce to Mustapha Kemal that we are desirous of effecting a settlement between the Turks and the Greeks ; that we should offer our services as mediators, informing Mustapha Kemal that the Greeks are willing to negotiate, and that in order to convince the Turks of our disinterestedness and impartiality and of our desire to live on terms of friendship, &amp;c, with them, we intend to withdraw our troops forthwith from Turkish territory.L; W.-E.The War Office,&apos;-9th November, 1921.
