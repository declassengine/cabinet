W.-E.The War Office, ,Uh November, 1921.1. The General Staff are asked to appreciate the military requirements of the situation which may arise in Egypt should the negotiations now taking place with the Egyptian Delegation break down and end in an open rupture. It appears that there are three separate aspects to be considered, which may be summarized as follows: (a.) That the present Government in Egypt continues ostensibly to support the High Commissioner, but has lost most of its hold over the people.In this case the disorder1 and violence&quot; might be confined to certain towns, such as Cairo, Alexandria and Port Said. The General Staff consider that the present garrison in Egypt is sufficiently strong to deal with disturbances of this nature without further reinforcements.(I).) That the agitation extends throughout the whole of Egypt, and that a situation arises similar to that which developed in 1919.(c.) That the Egyptian Government is itself actively hostile, and that the whole of the Egyptian Army and Police go over to the revolutionaries.2. Should the situation in (6) arise, the present garrison in Egypt will only be sufficient to maintain order in Cairo, Alexandria and Port Said, and to provide two small mobile columns for use in the Delta once the situation&quot; is in hand in the main centres. The garrisons in the towns mentioned will, however, be for a time practically immobilized, and our authority in Egypt could not long be maintained without the despatch of reinforcements. It is estimated that these reinforcements must be equivalent to about two brigades of. Infantry,* and it must be anticipated that a certain number of European lives will be lost before they can arrive. If, however,, the loyalty of the Egyptian Army in such a situation were sufficiently assured to enable them to be actively employed in maintaining order, the reinforcements in British troops might be reduced from two to one brigade.!3. Should the situation develop into that described in 1 (c), the reinforcements t)f two brigades referred to in the preceding paragraph will, in all probability, still Be sufficient to maintain order in the towns mentioned and throughout the Delta. But, in this case, the whole of Upper Egypt, which is entirely unoccupied by British troops, would have to be reoccupied. Unless further reinforcements beyond those mentioned were available, this could not be undertaken until Lower Egypt had been pacified. Operations might, in consequence, be considerably delayed, with a corresponding loss of life and property. To undertake the simultaneous pacification of the whole of Egypt, 0143 it has been estimated that in the worst conditions reinforcements of about the equivalent 1774&quot; of two Divisions might be required.* Telegram from General Oongreve, dated 21st October, 1921.f Further telegram from General Congreve, dated 24th October, 1921.(B21/336)   100   11/21   h&amp;S, Ltd.   9517wo
