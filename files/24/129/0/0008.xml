A few arrests were made in London.A deputation of the National Administrative Council of Unemployed consisting of Hannington, Haye, Holt (London), Kealey (Manchester), Pennell (Norwich) and Mrs. Flattery (Sinethwick) visited 10, Downing Street, and was later received b-y members of the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment.The Poplar Councillors wore releasod-on Oct. 12tt. after an apology to the Court which the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; describes as a &quot;verbal compromise&quot;.Instances are given of Russian propaganda in this country which amount to breaches of the Trading Agreement.The engineers and shipbuilders are to take a ballot on the proposed bonus cuta, the papers being returnable by October 26th.The National Union of Hailwaymen is concerned about its financial position:   the latest balance sheet showed a surplus of  1,221,000 on the union1a investments, against an overdraft of  262,936.   Increased contributions or a levy are under consideration.A very important seizure of munitions intended for Ireland was made at Cardiff yesterday night.   Three arrests were made.Ten members of the Irish Republican Army have been sent over to act as &quot;police&quot; at the entrance to Downing Street. They are believed to be armed and their names are appended.
THE TJHEMPIOYE-DTho unemployed demonstration in&quot;&apos;London yesterday was a fiasco from the point of view of the organisers. Between five and six thousand assembled on the Embankment and told the police that they intended to march to the City.   In Charing Cross Kocd they turned to the left and in Shaftssbury Avenue they became disorderly.   Some of them had stone a in their pockets which they threw at the police and some shop windows wore broken-,     Tha total number in -Sh^ftosbury Avenue probably did not exceed 2,000.   There were groups unconnected with the procession who intended ,.     to join in when the disorder began, but they were given no 3Uoh opportunity.   A small deputation, in which Hannington took part, was received in Downing Street, but there was no disorder at that point. A few arrests-were made.large demonstrations were held in most of the large towns yesterday, but according&apos; to the reports so far received, there was disorder in London and Dundee only:       there is little doubt that the absence of disorder was due to adequate police preparation as plans hod been laid by the organisers ,,of the unemployed on the lines of the circular detailed in my Special Report of October 10th.Violent speeches ware mode in Birmingham prior to yesterday*s meeting, but the   leaders of the unemployed, who had&apos; been forbidden, under an existing law to hold a meeting in Victoria Square9 decided to accept the route laid down by the police and no disturbance occurred..
In Wolverhamptotf the Chief Constable, who has H handled the local unemployed with much skill, arrange1 a football match for the benefit of thB latter: 7,000 people attended the match which proved a great success and prevented a demonstration.It is reported that the London unemployed intend shortly to make attacks on Town Halls and Public Libraries for the purpose of obtaining winter quarters.   The London Hi strict Council has also discussed further action on lines suggested by Cant and Slsbury:   they are of opinion that demonstrations should be discontinued and propose that each district should supply  0 or 30 resolute men who would make raids and pester the police in different localities as frequently as possible. Cant says that there are a few reliable men but in the case of mobs such as assembled on October 4th the majority run away in a time of crisis.On October 5th a seaman named John Campbell, stated at Stratford that the London District Council, and particularly Hannington, had deliberatly planned the demonstration of October 4th in order to bring   the unemployed into conflict with the Police and to arouse a feeling of bitterness against the authorities;   he added that he knew Hannington1 s group from A - 25 and that the only thing they were out for was money.   On October 8th Es-Inspector Syme, when referrirg tosthe events of October 4th, advised the Camberwell unemployed not to try to take Trafalgar Square by   $ force, but to stop in the surrounding streets, where they would dislocate the traffic, and thereby force the/
the authorities to accede to their wishes.Mrs. Leury said at Bat terse?., on October 11th, after a reference to October 4th, &quot;The time for action is coming and when it comes men be prepared.   It is of no use taking lumps of lead in your pockets to use; what you want is sis-chambered revolvers fully loaded.&quot; Violent speeches have also been made by other members of the London District Council.On October 9th Ha.nnin.3t0n said, at Battersea, that   during the coming week demonstrations were to be held all over England and Scotland and would occur at frequent intervals.   This was not the onlv, action they intended to adopt as they still had a number of trump cards up their sleeves.   There were many big houses in the West.End where the present occupier, who wore a very high collar, was used to ordering his meals of green peas etc, wouldbe surprised one day to find another man in his place at the table who would not leave the house until he had been given his food. They would all enter the hcU3es at a given signal and leave at a given signal, and if the Police were sent for - well a lot of damage could be done in a house of that description.Some members of the national Administrative Council of Unemployed are discussing the possibility of an unemployed march on London on Armistice Day:   the idea is that contingents from all parts 0^ the country should converge on London and send a deputation to the Prime Minister,On October 9th the Croydon unemployed demonstrated before the office of the Board of Guardians and a certain amount of a tone-throwing ensued, when the Board declined to change the scale of relief:   awindow/ -
window was&quot;broken-ana.,one- man. arrested.Lyle of Battersea was egsin charged at the South Western Police Court on October 11th with having used language likely to cause a breach of the peace:   he was ordered to find two sureties of  25 each and to be of good conduct for twelve months or in default was sentenced, to six weeks1 imprisonment.Beports from all over the country indicate progresi in the organisation of the unemployed and many committel have affiliated to the National Administrative Council of Unemployed.   &quot;Out of Work&quot; last week had a circulation of 51,000 and Haye is of opinion that, at the present rate of progress, its circulation will soon reach that of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.   The current issue contains a poem which is typical of the paper, a copy of which has been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions:&quot;To My Comrades on the Stones&quot;You are hungry, so am I. food we must have or else we die1..

owing to the increase in the number of out-going vessels.   There-are., however, about 40,000 unemployed in the Liverpool districts, where daily demonstration^) are taking place.   These have been orderly, since the disturbance at the Art Gallery, but ex-Police Sergeant Tissyman, who has a large following, in inclined towards violent action .   The unemployed have been granted the use of the Stadium for meetings frut Tissyman insists that they should continue to demand St. George&apos;-i Hall:   he is also urging the unemployed to demonstrate outside the houses of the Vo?3t Derby Guardians.No further disorder has occurred in Leicester but Robert Haarvey, of Birmingham, has taken over control of the unemployed and states that if ho is arrested others will be sent to take his place by the National-Administrative Oouncil of Unemployed.   Donovan Rossi has also boaa sent to Leicester from Hull.   Work has boon found for nearly 1,000 men in Leicester.My correspondent reports that processions are taking place daily in different parts of South Wales but that the enthusiasm for demonstrations is waning: the moderate labour leaders still have control in most districts but the secretary&apos;of the Newport Labour Part is resigning from the local Unemployed Committee owing the extreme viows of other members.The demonstrations organised by the Glasgow Trade and Labour Council on October 9th were broken up by Jo McLean1s followers: the Labour representatives were i allowed to speak, their platform being taken by the interrupters.

October .12tl. unemployed meetings attended by about 46,000 people have been reported from:
THE&apos; COMMUfl ISTSCommunist activity during the week has teen practically ill confined to the unemployed: the usual Party meetings have been held but the attendances have, for the most part, been poor.There is some activity among the officials in South Wales,twho hope to obtain control of the discontented miners.Attention is being paid in various parts of the country to the forthooming municipal elections and it is probable that several communist candidates will stand.In the current issue of the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; Sylvia Pankhurst announces her allegiance to the &quot;Fourth&quot; International, to which reference is made in the &quot;Socialist&quot; under the heading &quot;Long live the I - -r - Excuse me, whafs the number?&quot;The feud between the Communist Party of Great Britainand the Socialist Labour Party finds constant expression inthe &quot;Socialist&quot;, which is annoyed with the Communist Party forcommissioning Eden and Gedar Paul to translate Buchari^s&quot;A.5.C of Communism&quot; in to^l Imp id&quot; English as the book hasalready appeared in serial form in the &quot;Socialist&quot;.   The&quot;Socialist&quot; writes:&quot;Wow, we know that E. and C. Paul don&apos;t translate for nothing, and, that they don&apos;t even do it for next to nothing within the movement, and that they will have a substantial fee for tiieir translation, and the edition by the CP. of G.B. can only be produced by subsidy; and we-know that E. and C were keen to&apos;take on the ,1ob.&quot;In confirmation of this view it may be stated thatEden and Cedar Paul heve quoted a fee of 265 for translatinga book which is rather more than half the length of the &quot;A.B.C.of Communism&quot;,  15 for translating &amp; book of about 23,000words and  28 for one of about 30,000 words.This/
This week Fred Peet has sent  12.10.0. to Glasgow for organising expenses in addition to the usual  24 for salaries.     This money does not come from British sources.The first London meeting of the British Section of the Young Communist International was held in Trafalgar Scuare on Ootober 9th:   about 600 people were present and the speakers included Bishop, James Stetmrt and Coates. This meeting concluded the &quot;Red Youth Week&quot; which was an entire disappointment to its organisers.Whiteheed, who has been in Berlin in connection with the Famine Fund, is of opinion that &quot;tho German movement has nothing near the intellectuals that we have, and several of them work in the office in corderoys and hob-nail boots.&quot;RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA - IB GREAT britain on October 1st the Berlin 3ureau of the Young CommunistInternational sent a communication to James Stewart fromwhich the following extracts, indicating further breaches ofthe Trading Agreement by Moscow, are taken:&quot;The first issues of the bi-monthly circular issued by the Executive Committee of the Young Communist International to the Leagues affiliated with it will be sent out within a few days.   The circular, publication of which has been delayed considerably   .,-owing to various reasons is exclusively intended for the national executives and the branch and district committees.   Apart from that every branch group should be furnished with oneor two copies because of the important material which is of great value for the officials of the branch groups.     The executives must immediately write and tell us hov; many copies af the circular they regularly need.   We wish to,point out, however,-that the edition is very limited and exclusively intended for officials.   The circular will be sent directly to the executives free of cost.&quot;Financial matters.     The comrades doubtlessly know that the Executive has always been of the opinion that the Leagues should be self-supporting and that only those Leagues should receive financial assistance which are indeed very much in need of them, and that only for certain purposes.     This attitude holds good for the future.   The organisations must try harder than ever to carry out their work without financialassistance/
assistance from the Executive.     Leagues in a difficult financial position as a result of White Terror etc., and which would he unable to carry on their work unless they receive financial support are requested when asking forfjj financial support to send in a detailed monthly, budget. Regular financial support is out of the question, however any financial assistance rendered must be considered as extraordinary... ,^&quot;St^^b^^wbX^I^^      The executive committees must see that at least&apos; 60 copies of all their publication (periodicals, handbills, booklets, etc. ) are sent to our publishing house where they ere needed to complete our files. ,-&quot; -&quot;Addresses.-.     T&apos;ie comrades are requested to use for their letters those addresses which have been communicate to them by word of mouth.     tfires and printed matter are to be addressed to the publishing house.   Those Leagues able to communicate with Moscow directly must, send copies of &quot;their letters to the Berlin Bureau.     Under no circumstances should letters and communications,.for the E.C, of the Y.C.I. be sent to other addresses than those personally made known to you, especially not to the&apos; representatives of the Soviet Government etc.&quot;International Press Correspondence.     A bulletin containing material&quot;f or the press &quot;of both party and youth will, beginning with next week, be published regularly. The executives must see to it that the articles contained in the bulletin&apos;be made use of by their organs;    they must reach an agreement with the party press providing tl the latter could reprint those articles which in our opinion are especially suited for them.&quot;It will be seen that the paragraph   headed &quot;Addresses&quot;directly implicates &quot;representatives of the. SovietGovernment&quot; and. further evidence of Moscow&apos;s propaganda effortare given in the following letter from M. Philips Price toArthur - Mc Man us, which accompanied No. 1 of the-. International jPress Correspondence dated October 1st:..... \.&quot;I am sending you enclosed, the first number of the International press Correspondence (English Edition). The Executive in Moscow, as you know, decided to start this Bulletin in Berlin for the information of Communist editors and parties throughout the world, and they reques me to edit the English edition.&quot;I confess I am a little dubious about the use of it as fsr as the party in England and English speaking countries are concerned but I should like to.have your opinion as to whether *he Executive in England considers that it is worth cont-jiniing, judging by the first number. I understand that .you already receive articles and material&apos;direct from Moscow.     7&apos;here, -perhaps it may be ji * use, is in bringing articles and stuff from Central      V Europe, Italy,&apos; South West Europe, the LI ear- East, etc.    Im/1
In the next number I will put in all that sort of stuff and leave out the Russian.&quot;I may say that I only started on this because I was especially requested by the Moscow Executive to do so, but before continuing it, I want to be sure that I am not overlapping the work done by other comrades elsewhere, for in that case I should certainly advise not wasting time and money on it.&quot;Moscow&apos;s instructions in regard to famine propaganda have been transmitted daily during the past week to the Communist Party by &apos;.7hitehead from Berlin.     On October 3rd he sent a map of Soviet Russia showing the results of the droughtadding &quot;Comintern insists this map be published in all papers accompanied by vivid descriptive wording and urgent appeal for funds and &apos;Day&apos;s pay.&quot;    Rg has sent also details of the first transport ohip: of the &quot;Workers&apos;  Lnternational Famine Committee&quot; which was to leave Stettin on Ootober 8th.     The consignment was calculated &quot;to serve 5,000 persons per day for.six months&quot;, cost 1-^ million marks and included Quantities of food stuffs, onp heavy motor wagon with traotor, about 100-wooden chests filled with food, tools and clothes, ovens and field kitchens, miscellaneous artioles for kitchen use, carpentering tools, lamps, a sewing machine, wool, candles and modical drugs to the value of 200,000 marks.     Ten German workers accompany the transport.fthitehead is also endeavouring to enlist the help of English intellectuals and artists and suggests that a committee: be formed:   an International&apos; Artist&apos;s Help Committee appears already to be in existence in Berlin&apos;.; . &apos;f.    Whitehead has also informed Mclianus that &quot;one single page to Famine matters is absolutely insufficient and does not meet in the slightest degree the very urgent instructions from the Comintern.&quot;    He added, on October 8th &quot;so far the other delegates on the International. Committee, from France end Italy; have not arrived but are expected shortly, also four delegates from /
fToin-theJEJhi:^ should begin to hum.&quot; vA copy of No. 1 of the Red Labour Union International &quot;Bulletin of the Executive Bureau&quot;, published in Mosoow, has been Issued from the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; Office.     Thisjjj publication is pure propaganda, directed chiefly to the overthrow of Trade Unions and urges the formation of &quot;Propaganda Committees&quot; in every industry.     The fact that it is printed in English for distribution in this country would appear to be a breach of the Trading Agreement.THE RED TRADE UNION INTERNATIONALOn September 29th and 30th the British Bureau of this movement, which is in future to be called the Red International of Labour Unions, met in London and received Tom Mann&apos;s report and instructions from Moscow.     In spite of the Cardiff decision to merge the Red Trade Union. International in the Communist Party of Great Britain it was resolved to carry on the movement &quot;independent of but complementary to the Communist Party of Great Britain with an exchange of representatives on the two executive bodies.&quot; It was also decided to dissolve the Bureau as at present constituted and tor-set up &quot;a representative centre for the revolutionary trade union movement,&quot;     In order to provide funds it was agreed to levy the fellow ing affiliation fees:&apos;&quot;LooalTrade Union branches....... 2d. per member per annum.&quot;        &quot;     district corns., s/-   &quot;   1,000 membersper annum.Trades Councils............. 1,/-   &quot; &quot;Trade Union Federations.... l/-   &quot; &quot;50$ of all fees to be sent to the central bureau.

as representatives of the Red International of Labour Unions in this country:   the former is prepared-to-a&amp;dress-meetings and his terms are  4.4,0 plus hotel and travelling expenseg for which local committees have to accept responsibility.Further evidence of the close hold which Moscow retains on the movement in this country is contained in a letter written by Lismer to Pollitt in which he says that Tom Mann has instructed that three copies each of the &quot;Herald&quot;, &quot;Worker&quot; and &quot;The Communist&quot; be sent to the &quot;Profintern&quot;,-13, Graaalni Pereoulok, Moscow.   &quot;While these papers are being received by the Comintern nothing is arriving for the Industrial International,,&quot;1.   /STS AND convictions on October 10th Dick Beech, whose views on Communist propaganda in the Navy were given in my Report No, 124, was sentenced to two months1 hard labour at Liverpool for being in unlawful possession of a postal letter.   The theft occurred in connection with business of the Communist Party.On October 11th James McDaugall pleaded guilty when charged at the Glasgow Sheriff Court with having made a seditious speech on September 20th and expressed his regret and his decision to c^ase public speaking:   he was sentenced to sixty days1 impti sonment.On October 12th four of the Pclham unemployed, T. James G, Warner, J.W. Tyrell and W, Alloway were charged at the West London Police Court with having obstructed and assaulted the police, at the conclusion of an open air meeting of the people s League,    James wss sentenced to one month1s imprisonment, Warner to 21 days, and Tyiell smd Alloway to 14 days&apos; each.On October 12th a Commiinist, named J. Donaldson, wascharged/
tcharged at Birmingham with having made a. speech inciting   -others to commit crime and was remanded for a week.On October 12th F. Porter, a labourer, was bound overifor breaking a plate glass window, value  3, at Croydon Union Offices during an unemployed demonstration on October 9th.On the same day P. GJJ.anville was charged at Bristol wit using seditious language and endeavouring to provoke public disorder:   he was remanded, bail being refused.Mrs. Leury, whose speech is Quoted in another part ofthis report, was arrested on October 13th, and bound over in her own recognizances of  25 and two sureties of like amount SIM FEIN IN GREAT BRITAINThe Irish delegates were given an enthusiastic reception by their countrymen in London, among whom there is much speculation as to the outcome of the conference: while the majority ardently desire peace those who are in closest touch with the Irish leaders say that the conference will break down unless the right to complete independence is admitted.It was noticed that when His Majesty arrived from Manchester a short time before the train carrying the Irish delegates came in, the crowd cheered and waved Sinn Fein flags in what appeared to be an outburst of spontaneous loyalty.The general lack of interest in the Irish Self-Determination League is causing the leaders some anxiety. Membership has declined rapidly during the last few months and many of the branches are closing down:   it is, however, hoped that the winter campaign will give the movement new life.   On October 6th Saklatvala addressed a meeting of the Roger Casement Sinn Fein Club in Blaokfriars Road, taking as his subject &quot;The Fall of the British Empire.&quot;   He contended that much of the present trade -depression is due go the Indian boycott of the cottonj
*Industry.&apos;and stated that India intended to continue this boycott in order to bring about complete chaos to. the British . Empire.   Be introduced as &quot;MT.- V.&quot; and &quot;Mr. V7.&quot; two Indians who have recently arrived in this country,&apos;   Some of the Sinn Peiners in this slub are anxious that the Indians should folio?/ in the footsteps of Sinn Fein and do all they cm to make British rule impossible in India.    Mr* George Mortimer suggested that the ambushing of Crown Forces in Ireland was not murder but a fight to prevent murder,   Art 0&apos;&apos;Bfien, who is President of this Club, was present at the meeting..On Ootober 9th about;SOCOpeople attended a meeting of the Irish Self Determination league in Victoria Park; the speakers included J. Cahiil, Mayor of Stepney, Councillor Purcell, London organiser, P.P, CBart, and 3* Jones, LLP.    The resolution passed demanded the release&apos;of the 3,000 Irish internees and pledged support of the Ir^sh delegates in whatever action they may take at the peace conference.    The speeches were defiant in tone and much was said about, the readiness of the Irish Republican Army to resume hostilities.There is little activity in Sinn Fein circles in Liverpool; Joseph Brown has reported that whereas there were 3,500   members of the Irish Solf-Determination League in Liverpool 12 months ago there are now only 504.    Branches exist only in name, halls have been abandoned and the caretakers have stolen the postal orders and letters.    The present state of the League in Liverpool is largely due to the action taken against the Clubs some time ago.-It has been known for some time that the principal collecting point for munitions for the Irish Heoublican Army isfitin South Wales, to which point munitions purchased and stolen from all parts of Great Britain were be in?? conveyed.   The depdtwas /
was in charge of J.P. Connolly.   Acting on information from this Department,  the&apos; Cardiff and Merthyr Police effected yesterday the arrest of J.P. Connolly and two others and seized the entire contents of the depQt which included arms, bombs and high explosives.J. J. Duggan, seoretary of the Scottish Sinn Fein executive, has been requested by Dublin Headquarters to push forward the winter campaign in Scotland as soon as possible.Cn October 11th a-wreath bearing the following inscription was placed on the Cenotaph.Sacred to the Memory of the586   OFFICERS, H.CO. fS   and   MEN ofHIS   MAJESTY&apos;S   ARMY,    NAVY,  and POLICE FORCES,Who, Having Fought for King and CountryIN     TBS   GREAT     war have Since Been Foully Murdered &apos; By The King&apos;&apos;s Enemies IN     ireland a second wreath commemorates the deaths of two English Officers who are described as having been murdered in Ireland in 1920.IRELANDThe two houses taken in London to accommodate the Irish Envoys have been rented for three months, and it seems likely that the Sinn Fein &quot;Government&quot; intend, if possible, to prolong the negotiations so as to enable them to get their &quot;Departments&apos; into working order and accustom the people of Ireland to their control/
control.   They will then present the British Government with e &quot;fait accompli&quot; and d mand the right to negotiate as an Independent and Sovereign people.   Art 0&apos;Brien, the &quot;Republican Government Representative&quot; in England, has been considering the question of the issuing of passports to persons to go to Ireland.There is no particular information of importance from Ireland during tho week and much depends now on the next few days whether the Confer once will mean a resumption of hostilities or not.There is evidence accumulating of the efforts made by Sinn Fein extremists to encourage all anti-British Revolutionaries to emulate the methods of Sinn Fain which, it is claimed, have been successful in obtaining for them their rights; particularly is this so with natives of india both at home and in India. Unfortunately many of the Irish extremists, members of the Irish Repxxblican Brotherhood, are not only determined on getting complete independence from England but are imbued with such hatred towards us that they wish for and will work for the downfall of the British Empire.Ten members of the Irish Republican Army left North Wall on the night of the 10th for London, whore they will act as Intelligence scouts or detectives.   They will mix with the crowd around Downing Street and at other places where the envoys are.     Their names are;- Scanlan. Dodd, Boyce, lalone, Irwin, Duffy, Mitchell, Molloy, Burke, and Travers.
