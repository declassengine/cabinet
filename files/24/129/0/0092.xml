[This Document is the Property of Eis Britannic Majesty sG-overnnyent.]&apos; Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1921.SECRET.CP.-3490.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for-Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 14th instant.General State of the Country.Observance of Truce.Although a number of serious breaches have been reported, the truce has, on the whole, been better observed by Sinn Fein since my last report. The new liaison arrangements are now everywhere in operation, and, so far as present indications go, appear to be working smoothly. The Chief Sinn Fein Liaison Officials in Dublin have shown themselves desirous of co-operating in removing causes of friction, and, 1 have reason to believe, are striving energetically to- restore a stricter discipline among their followers throughout the country. If their efforts in the latter direction prove successful the greatest danger to the maintenance of the truce will have been removed. The most serious breaches reported during the past week were : the firing at a military sentry at Powerscourt, Co. Wicklow, on the 7th instant, the firing at and wounding of a Constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary at Ballyrusheen, Co. Tipperary, on the 10th instant and an attack upon a District Inspectors car at Hannahstown, near Dunmurry, Co. Antrim, on the 13th instant. The circumstances of the first-mentioned outrage are very obscure. No trace of the would-be assassins has been discovered and the only ground for assuming them to have been members of the I.R.A. is the absence of any assignable private motive. Fortunately the sentry, although his cap was pierced by a bullet, escaped personal injury. The wounding of the Constable at Ballyrusheen on the 10th instant appears to have been due to local hostility to another Constable who was with him at the time and was apparently the intended victim of the attack. Both Constables were cycling back from Portroe to Nenagh after an absence of eight hours on leave, when they were fired at by about four men who lay concealed in ambush behind a road fence at Ballyrusheen, about 2 miles from Nenagh. There can be no doubt that the outrage was deliberately planned, but there is no reason to suppose that the miscreants were other than irresponsible mischief-makers acting on their own initiative. The matter is at present under investigation by the police in conjunction with the local Sinn Fein Liaison Official. The Hannahstown case was an open and flagrant breach of the truce committed without provocation or extenuating circumstances of any kind. A District Inspector of the Royal Irish Constabulary was proceeding in his private car, accompanied only by a Sergeant in uniform, from Lisburn to Dunmurry, in the County Antrim, when he came upon a party of about 120 Sinn Feiners marching in military formation, four abreast, in the direction of Belfast. On recognising, the car the Sinn Fein party attempted to close in upon it and shouts were raised of threats to shoot the occupants. One man jumped upon the running board of the car and was promptly fired at and wounded by the District Inspector, who succeeded in forcing his car safely through the crowd amidst a volley of revolver bullets. &apos; The attention of the Sinn Fein Liaison Authorities has been drawn to this outrage and a full investigation has been promised.The othei breaches of the truce committed during the week included the looting of a vacated Coastguard Station at Lackeen, Kenmare District, Co. Kerry, on the 7th instant, and a raid upon the Haulbowline Rock Lighthouse, Co. Down, on the 12th instant, in which a telescope, a number of electric batteries and a quantity of ammunition were taken. Another outrage which is believed to have been committed by Sinn Fein, although definite evidence is wanting, was a raid upon the premises of the Millfield,Foundry Company (Limited), Belfast, on the night of the 8th instant, resulting in the seizure of 5,000 springs and strikers for the manufacture of Mills bombs. &apos; -[7335]
Eighteen cases of illegal arrest were reported during the week, the motive in three of these cases being to prevent the person arrested from attending Petty or Quarter Sessions.  Seven of the arrested; persons are known to have been released.Situation in Belfast.Several minor disturbances occurred in Belfast during the week, but owing to the prompt intervention by the police and military order was quickly restored in every case. On the 9th instant five revolver shots were fired in Dock Street, &quot; D &quot; District, a Roman Catholic youth of 17 years of age being slightly wounded, and on the 11th instant a boy of 9 years of age, also a Roman Catholic, was wounded by a revolver bullet. Another outbreak of revolver firing took place from Earl Street, a Unionist quarter, on the 13th instant, but no person was injured.Trials by Court-Martial.The results of twenty Court-Martial trials were promulgated during the week, showing nineteen convictions and one acquittal. Six of the convictions were on the charge of murder, but the capital sentence in every case was commuted to penal servitude for life. In two of these cases the accused were Constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who were convicted of the murder of a civilian at Ballyroan, Queen&apos;s County, in December of last year. Another Constable, who was charged with the murder of a comrade in Templemore Barrack, Co. Tipperary, on the 30th June last, was found to be insane and unfit to stand his trial and was committed to the Broadmoor Lunatic Asylum. One of the civilian cases was for the murder of a Constable at Newtownards on the 23rd March, 1921, and the three other cases were for murder and robbery committed at Knocknagree, Co. Down, in September 1920. Another civilian accused in connection with this crime was acquitted. Sentence of two years&apos; hard labour was imposed in one case of theft and sentence of nine months&apos; imprisonment with hard labour in ten cases of attempting to escape from an Intern-ment Camp.Internments.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 12th instant Total orders made    ...... ..&quot;. ... ...      4,388Orders cancelled for reasons other than release       242 Releases ordered ... ... ... ...       733--.    975Number of persons now interned ... ... ...      3,413The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 3.State of the Police Forces.

By the same Order the 1st December, 1921, has been fixed as the appointed day as respects the transfer of Irish Services in connection with Local Government (including Housing), Public Health (not including Health Insurance), Poor Law, Old Age Pensions, Records, Road Transport (excluding Railways), Ferries and Bridges, Firearms and Explo-sives, Prisons, Reformatory and Industrial Schools and Lunatics; and the 1st January, 1922, has been fixed as the appointed day as regards other transferable Irish Services not previously transferred, with the exception of Education, Science and Art and Technical Instruction, for which the 1st February, 1922, has been fixed as the appointed day. The arrangements for giving effect to this Order are well advanced and are being proceeded with expeditiously. Another Order in Council of the same date provides for the provisional constitution of the Joint Exchequer Board and of the Civil Service Committee, the powers of the Treasury and Govern-ment of Southern Ireland in respect of the appointment of representatives on these bodies being made exercisable by the Lord-Lieutenant until the Treasury and Govern-ment of Southern Ireland have been established.H.
