A. -,--                                                                                              ^c.P.3439, TEMPORARY INCREASED CHARGING POWERS FOR- TRANSPORT UNDERTAKINGS.Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport.In order to avoid the necessity for a large number of Private Bills giving increased charging powers to individual transport undertakings, the Minister of Transport in Memorandum C .P.32&amp;8 of August 17th recommended that a promise should be given that if the question was not otherwise dealt with by Parliament the Government would introduce legislation continuing till February 15th, 1924, the charging powers of canals which would otherwise expire on February 15th? 1925, and would Include the Acts under which temporary charging powers are conferred on tramways, docks and harbours in the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Act, thus extending them till February 15th, 1924.As aotion was necessary before the matter could be considered by the Cabinet, an announcement to the above effect was made on the authority of the Prime Minister,This extension of charging,powers was intended to cover all docks and harbours, but the Railway Companies Association has now made a representation that the continuance for another yjan of the Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1920, will not meet the case of the docks and harbours owned by railway companies since, in their opinion, the conditions of that Act will make it impossible for a railway company to make a successful application under It.I am advised that the legal point is not free from doubt and that unless some further pledge is given each railway company may be obliged to introduce a Private Bill next session.
The present charging powers, whidh were obtained under the Ministry of Transport Act/ expire on February 15th, 1923, and I seek authority to inform the Railway Companies that a Bill will be introduced to oontinue these powers to February 15th, 1924, subject to a power of review by the Minister after taking the advice of a committee.    By this measure the railway dooks will be placed in the same position as regards revision of charging powers as non-railway owned docks and I do not anticipate that any opposition will be made to the measure aI am, however, bound to point out that the proposed prooediire only postpones the difficulty for a year and it would be more logical to extend the temporary charging powers as regards docks for two years instead of one.    By that time the railway companies will be amalgamated and the four amalgamated companies will be able to introduce Bills dealing with the charging powers of their harbours and docks on a permanent basis.If, however, the charging powers of the railway owned docks are extended for a further year without necessity for the introduction of private Bills the same privilege must undoubtedly be conceded to non-railway owned docks * Tramway Undertakings, both municipal and private, are also pressing me to make permanent the existing power of the Minister to vary their charging powers above their statutory maxima.     The point to be decided, therefore, is whether the practice adopted during the ?ar and the Armistice period should bs continued, namely that transport undertakings shall be able to obtain charging powers above their statutory maxima under general legislation Instead of by the promotion of private Bills.
V 266   IThe argument for the existing legislation which terminates on the 15th February 1923 was that the trend of prices was so uncertain that it was not possible for Parliament to fix satisfactory statutory maxima.     It was anticipated that by 1923 prices would have become sufficiently stable for permanent maxima to be fixed. It Is now probable that stability will not be reached by 1923 and on these grounds it might be possible to continue temporary legislation for one year, but hardly for two. years and certainly not permanently as the Tramways desire.     Justification for such a measure must be sought on other grounds.     It is considered by a large body of expert opinion that the principle of statutory maximum charges is wrong and that a more flexible method of fixing charges for statutory Companies is desirable.     The prices of Gas and Water Companies have always been made variable with the dividends of the Companies.   The rates and charges of transport undertakings are too complicated to be susceptible to a fixed relation with profits, and in the Railways Act 1921 by the consent of the Railway Companies and of the Traders a   Tribunal has been set up to adjust charges to revenue.     The advantage to the Undertakings is that they are saved the expense of promoting private Bills.      The advantage to the public i3 that the procedure of an enquiry by a committee before an Order is made gives an opportunity for interested parties to express their views more effectively and at less expense than in the case of a Private Bill, and that if prices fall the charges can be more readily revised on the initiative of the Minister. The objections urged are:-(1)   That Parliament ought not to leave to administrative action so important a duty as the fixing of maximum charges.
(2)   That ministerial responsibility for the charges means an unnecessary extension of bureaucratic activity,(3)   That the Undertakings will not in fact exact the maximum charges to which they are entitled since competition between the ports as regards docks and harbours and the competition with other means of transport as regards tramways and canals make it necessary to give a service as cheap as possible.(4)   That the existing Acts in many cases already providerevision.I am not impressed with the argument that Parliament is giving up a duty since Parliament can at any time recall the powers given to a Department or to a Tribunal.     Nor do I think that the small extension of departmental work involved Is sufficient to stop a measure desirable on general grounds.   I consider, however, that thore is force in the contention that transport undertakings other than railways are not in a position, whatever their statutory powers, to make excessive charges, but even if tills is true in general It is possible for docks to make unreasonable charges in respect of particular services and similarly for tramways to make excessive charges for particular routes where they may hold a monopoly.     I recommend therefore that(1*   I should be authorised to inform the Railway Companies that in any case the charging powers of railway-owned docks will be extended, subject to revision by the Minister of Transport after consulting a Conaaittee (not necessarily the Rates Tribunal), to February 15th, 1924.(2)   I should be authorised to prepare Bills(I) making permanent the Tramways (Temporary Increaseof Charges) Act, 1920 (ii)contimvvng to February 15th, 1925, and makingapplicable to railway-owned undertakings theHarboura, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increaseof Charges) Act, 1920.that the appropriate Government Department may! initiate anistry of Transport, 6, Whitehall Gardens ,S.YJ. 1. 24th October, 1921.(Signed) ARTHUR HEAL.
